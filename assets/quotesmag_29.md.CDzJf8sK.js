An innovator of organic architecture, Kellogg built a wide assortment of distinctive buildings. Homes include the Lotus House, Wingsweep, the High Desert house, and the Onion House. Public buildings include the Hoshino Wedding Chapel in Japan and Charthouse restaurants. Biography Kendrick Bangs Kellogg was born in 1934 in San Diego, named for John Kendrick Bangs. Kellogg is related to Frederick Law Olmsted, \\"The Father of Landscape Architecture\\" (of the 1800s), who was a cousin to Kellogg's grandfather. Olmsted's landscape designs were curvilinear and irregular, a significant break from the formal symmetrical patterns of the time, a practice which Kellogg sees himself continuing.Kay Kaiser, Global Architecture No. 29, 1990 Kellogg studied for five years at San Diego State University, the University of Colorado, the University of Southern California, and the University of California at Berkeley. In 1955 he met Frank Lloyd Wright, and the brief meeting provided an inspiration. Kellogg completed his math and engineering courses and left Berkeley without a degree. His first design was a house in Mission Beach area of San Diego in 1957. By 1964, he had obtained his California architectural license and designed and built five residences.Friends of Keybar Volume 2.4 April 1984 Kellogg's architecture does not fit neatly into the same category as Frank Lloyd Wright, Bruce Goff, Bart Prince, or other organic architects. Kellogg's architecture is unique to Kellogg. His work was described as \\"the Sydney Opera House meets Stonehenge.\\"Hawaiian Island Home, April 1991 Like Goff, Wright, and many other architects, Kellogg's buildings are studies of layered, segmented, and unfolding space. A big difference between Goff and Kellogg involves the feeling of permanence and impermanence in their architecture. Most of Goff 's clients had moderate incomes, so he used inexpensive materials. Thirty years later, some of his art is popping apart. Kellogg was more fortunate. He worked for people who could afford copper, well-poured concrete and the best craftsmanship available. With Goff, part of the excitement is that one feels that the wind could shake the house down, so lightly is the structure tethered to the earth. Kellogg houses feel heavy, firmly connected to their foundations. The beams and radiating members remind people of the stout keels and ribs in ships designed to weather storms. Kellogg's visible interior structure reminds observers of spinal columns that supported the weight of whales or dinosaurs. Kellogg said, \\"To realize truly creative architecture you need clients with the vision and imagination to make the most of any site. Great clients are those who allow an architect the latitude to give them what they didn't know they wanted until they have it! They are willing to risk being unique. The Hoshino Wedding Chapel in Japan is a good example, built for a client with a great sense of quality and beauty, and a desire to circumvent the restrictions of society. This much used rock and concrete chapel is a successful and popular example of architecture built for future generations.\\" He was also a community planner responsible for instituting, in San Diego, the only planned district ordinance allowing compatible neighborhood character without inhibiting the diversity of any architectural style. His work has been published in USA, France, Germany and Japan. Groundbreaking Building Designs Kellogg designed and engineered \\"more than a dozen startling residences, including the Surfer House in La Jolla and the Onion House in Kona, Hawaii.\\" His distinctive aesthetic has been described as \\"an architecture so full of life that it seems to breathe.\\" The curvilinear architecture of Kellogg's architecture is reminiscent of the fanciful creations of Antoni Gaudi in Spain, while the central fireplaces and geometric lines are shaped by teachings of Frank Lloyd Wright. The High Desert House in Joshua Tree, California, built by Kellogg for the artist Bev Doolittle, is formed to integrate with the immense boulders found on the site. The structure has no walls, but is formed by 26 enormous cantilevered concrete columns sunk seven feet into the bedrock. John Vulgrin, the craftsman who created many of the intricate custom details, labored for two decades on the building site. Kellogg's third design, known as the \\"Onion House\\", is an early example of dramatic mingling of light and stone unique to his designs. A landmark of organic architecture, it was constructed in Kona, Hawaii during 1961‚Äì62 for Elizabeth von Beck. Hand-built by Kellogg, with the assistance of William Slatton, the design employs translucent arching roof panels. With no outside walls, the division between interior and exterior consists of screen or stained glass. Massive lava rock walls form the central fireplaces and angled interior walls, while concrete arches radiate from the fireplaces to support the roof structures. Stained glass throughout both structures and the mosaic dining table were built by artist James Hubbell. One of Kellogg's most celebrated works is the Hoshino Chapel in Karuizawa, Japan, which employs precast concrete arches and stone walls. It has become Japan's most popular wedding chapel.

It shares its front door with the ABC Architectuurcentrum Haarlem, which is located next door. The museum is devoted to presenting and preserving the cultural history of Haarlem and the surrounding region. History In 1990 the museum was opened for the public in a building that was once part of the St. Elisabeth Gasthuis hospital. Abbreviated to \\"EG\\", the hospital was housed there in the former \\"Minder Broeders\\" monastery from 1581 until it moved in 1971 to the Boerhaavelaan.400 Jaar St. Elisabeth's of Groote Gasthuis te Haarlem; A.F. Gaarlandt-Kist, Leeuwarden, 1981 Today the hospital has fused with the St. Johannes de Deo hospital and is called the Kennemer Gasthuis. The museum is just one of several local cultural institutions sharing the historical hospital site which covers an entire city block surrounding the old monastery garden later redesigned by Zocher and now called the \\"Egelantiertuin\\". The museum entrance situated at Groot Heiligland 47 was previously the polyclinic entrance to the hospital, joining the former Jewish Hospital \\"Joles\\" to the St. Elisabeth's Gasthuis. The Joles hospital, which itself had only been established in 1929‚Äì1931, was often called mistakenly the \\"Sint Joles\\" by townsfolk, and had always been affiliated with the EG, though it is topped with a copper tower with a Jewish star. Since they shared the same medical staff and financial administration, the only real difference between the two hospitals was the food served to patients, since the Jewish community preferred Kosher meals. After being separated administratively from the EG in 1942 by the German occupying forces during WWII, the space was later formally annexed by the EG in the late 1940s due to a lack of Jewish patients. Collaboration with regional historical institutions The history museum that opened in 1990 was formed by a collaboration of various Haarlem societies, most notably the Haarlem Historical Society, that formed in 1975. The collaboration, called \\"Historisch Museum Zuid-kennemerland\\", represents various historical groups from the region, including Haarlem, Schoten, Spaarndam, Heemstede, Bloemendaal, Santpoort and Zandvoort. The museum hosts a collection of historical paintings and artifacts, including items from the collection of the Coen Cuser Stichting, a former orphanage that has been converted to apartments, but whose line of regents live on in their Stichting. Their original builder's maquette by J.A.G. van der Steur of the Coen Cuserhof is on display. In the timeline room there are artifacts regarding Haarlem's history from 1245 to modern times and in the small auditorium a statue of Laurens Janszoon Coster stands next to an old book press. The museum has a fifteen-minute film in Dutch or in English about the history of Haarlem that is often used by walking tours or other groups that can be run on request for any visitors interested, which touches on the history from the siege of Haarlem in 1568-1572 up to the first railway locomotive (Arend) and the first flight of the Fokker Spin. The museum works together with schools and other museums in Haarlem, and often hosts temporary exhibitions on Kennemerland history. There is a combi-pass available for visitors choosing to visit both the Frans Hals Museum and the Museum Haarlem on the same day.

It is on the Mount Morgan - Wowan railway line. The station was constructed in 1898 to service the former goldrush and gold mining township of Mount Morgan and its mine. The station was designed by Henrik Hansen, who also designed the Archer Park, Shorncliffe and South Brisbane railway stations. The station operated as a functional railway station from 1898 until 1987,Centenary of the Town of Mount Morgan, Mount Morgan and District Historical Society 1982 pp211-213Rockhampton Regional Council: Mount Morgan Railway Museum after which it was restored as a Railway Heritage Museum. The museum includes artefacts from the rail and mining history of Mount Morgan, including a restored Hunslett steam engine, \\"Silver Bullet\\" rail motor and timber rail carriages. The station was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Mount Morgan rack railway, 1913 The Mount Morgan gold mine had been developed in 1883 and by 1889 with a mining population of 5,836 people, Mount Morgan's fortunes had attained their first peak. From 1903 copper was extracted and in 1929 a new company, Mount Morgan Limited, established an open cut to extract the copper ore. The line linking Mount Morgan with Rockhampton, via Kabra on the Central Western railway line, was opened on 26 November 1898. The line was subsequently extended to Wowan on 16 October 1912. From the opening, a service of three trains daily was provided. which were maintained at Mount Morgan from 1898 to 1952 when a lower gradient deviation was opened Due to the steep inclines in the Razorback Ranges, the line included a section of rack railway between Moonmera and the Mount Morgan township. It was built at half the cost of a conventional railway, at a time when the longevity of the ore deposit was unknown, but added significantly to operating costs and time delays on the journey. Special-purpose steam locomotives had to attach to the train for ascent and descent of the rack section. Although only approximately long, the rack section speed of approximately . The time for the rack loco to attach and detach added 40 minutes or more to the journey compared to a conventional line, and the maximum load was limited to ~. To prevent runaways if wagon couplings broke, the engine was typically coupled at the lower side of the train, when ascending and descending the incline. The steepest grade was 1 in 16.5 (~6%), double the steepest grade on a conventional line and three times steeper than the usual maximum grade. The rack locomotives were maintained at Mount Morgan from 1898 until 1952, when a deviation bypassing the rack railway was opened. Abt rack locomotive at Mount Morgan, Queensland, 1890-1900 The rack section used the Abt rack railway system, which was developed in Switzerland and was one of three such lines in Australia. The remaining two are the West Coast Wilderness Railway, a former mining line located in Tasmania, rebuilt as a tourist attraction, and the Skitube Alpine Railway serving the Blue Cow ski resort in New South Wales. An appropriate station building for an important provincial town was designed by Henrik Hansen, who was responsible for similar stations at Cunnamulla, Winton, Archer Park and Emerald in the same period. The first stage of the station building constructed in 1898. The locomotive water supply at Mount Morgan failed in 1901. The following year, when water supplies failed completely, the mine and town were kept going by trains hauling water from Stanwell. Twelve trains per day unloaded into the bed of the Dee River from the nearby railway bridge (since made into a road bridge). In 1917-18, the station yard was enlarged. The engine shed moved to a new site to allow more room, and a turning triangle or forkline as installed to replace the turntable. In 1919-20, an elevated coal stage was erected. A parcels office and station master's office was added at the north end of the station building in 1912. Refreshment rooms followed in 1921, initially opened or taken over as part of the State-enterprises policy. The rooms were closed and re-sited as barrack quarters in 1968. By 1940, the complex consisted of station building, refreshment rooms, dock road, tank, engine shed, oil store, examiners shed, double rail weighbridge, goods shed, office and crane with warehouse crane, station masters house, fireman's house, quarters, forkline, small coal stage and trucking yards. The rack railway was closed in April 1952, after the Razorback Range deviation was opened, with grades of 1 in 50 (2%), able to handle ~ trains, allowing the haulage of Callide coal through Mount Morgan with conventional steam locomotives. The deviation was constructed because the rack locomotives had reached the end of their working lives, but also because the bottleneck that the rack section created meant the development of export coal mines at Callide and Moura would not have been possible. A concrete retaining wall from the rack line remains at the top of the Razorback Ranges on the entry to Mount Morgan. A short section of the rack centre rail has been retained in Morgan Street, Mount Morgan, opposite the town museum.The Mount Morgan Rack Railway, J.W. Knowles 1982 pp 5-49 After the rack railway was removed, the Mount Morgan to Rockhampton line operated as a fully adhesion-based railway. In 1955, a separate room for shunters was provided and the guard's room moved. In 1959, the crane (spare) was moved to Innisfail. A double rail weighbridge was provided in 1964. During the 1960s, coal-fired steam engines were gradually replaced by diesel-electric locomotives which were maintained at the Rockhampton railway workshops. Previously, the steam engines had been repaired and maintained at the Mount Morgan locomotive depot. The first diesel-electric locomotive to work through to Mount Morgan arrived on 26 May 1964, and steam locomotive operations via Mount Morgan ceased in October 1967. In 1971, the coal stage was dismantled. With activities at Mount Morgan mine declining to a point where there was little traffic, the retention of the Mount Morgan railway depot became uneconomical and in May 1984, the facility was downgraded to two employees. On 1 August 1987, the railway from Kabra through Mount Morgan to Wowan closed, following the construction of a direct line from the Moura and Callide mines to the coal loading terminal at Gladstone, allowing trains to handle haul loads. The old line was dismantled in 1989, but the Mount Morgan station building and yard, and a short section of track, were retained for tourism purposes. The Mount Morgan Shire Council was given tenancy in 1988.  Description  Mount Morgan Railway Station Complex The Station Building is a Classical Revival Boom Style structure with imposing roadside elevational treatment and 10 bay carriage shade. The roadside elevation has a central arcaded portico carried on grouped cast iron columns with surmounting cast iron lace panels and timber parapet having a curved pediment and \\"AD 1898 Mount Morgan\\" on the entablature. Flanking verandahs strengthen the buildings symmetry which is offset by the 1912 additions, having their own portico in the manner of an end pavilion with pedimented treatment enhancing the overall composition. There are minor later additions at both ends and the parapet urns have been removed. Accommodation consists of the vestibule which is enriched on the platform side with fretted timber brackets and spandrels, comparable with Clifton and Toowoomba station buildings. The ladies' room and closets are to the south and offices and parcels office to the north. The carriage shade protects 2 tracks and has standard curved Warren girder trusses supported on timber posts and c.g.i. cladding. The former Refreshment Rooms, since relocated to an adjoining site as barracks, are a rectangular building, approximately with rear kitchen wing, offset gable roof, later windows and shades. The Shunters/Guards Room, later bike shed and crew room, is a representative building of its period. The Goods Shed is approximately timber- framed c.g.i. clad structure with internal platform and siding, 4 doors to the sides and a later timber office at the south end. There is an intact rainwater head at the south-west corner. There is a warehouse crane inside the building. The Weighbridge Office is insitu but the weighbridge has been removed. The Signal Cabin has been relocated from Glenmore Junction (North Coast Railway - junction for Yeppoon and Emu Park closed lines). The Tank is a 2 tier cast iron tank with 2 jibs, manufactured by Walkers Limited Engineers, Maryborough, supported on riveted and bellied iron beams and a timber stand with store.  Heritage listing  Mount Morgan Railway Station Complex was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Mount Morgan railway station has historic significance as a substantial and imposing complex built to serve a thriving mining township. Of the various comparable places including Charters Towers, Ravenswood and Gympie only Mount Morgan survives with a high level of integrity sufficient to directly demonstrate the optimism of the period. The station building compares closely with the later Archer Park (1899), Emerald (1900) and Longreach (1916), surviving as the earliest example of this important group designed by Henrik Hansen at that time when the noted architect John J. Clark was receiving commissions from Queensland Railways and may have had influence on its design. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The water tank is rare, comparing only with Quilpie in that its builder's plate connects it with the noted engineering firm of Walkers Limited of Maryborough. The goods shed is also a rare survivor comparing with Warwick and Wyandra which also retain warehouse cranes. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The complex retains the principle elements of a late Victorian station of importance. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building has aesthetic qualities valued today by the community.

At present it contains only two species Petrocardium cerrejonense and Petrocardium wayuuorum, the type species. The genus is solely known from the Middle to Late Paleocene (about 60 to 58 Ma), Cerrej√≥n Formation deposits in Colombia.Cerrej√≥n 0315 at Fossilworks.org  History and classification  The genus is known only from the two holotype specimens, number ING-0902, type specimen for Petrocardium wayuuorum, and ING-0804, type specimen for Petrocardium cerrejonense. The leaves are currently residing in the collections housed by the Colombian Geological Institute in Bogot√°, Colombia. Both ING-0902 and ING-0804 were collected from Cerrej√≥n Formation exposures in the Cerrej√≥n coal mine, located in the Rancher√≠a Basin, Colombia. They were first studied by a group of researchers from Florida Museum of Natural History, the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and led by Fabiany Herrera from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. Herrera and associates published their 2008 type description in the American Journal of Botany. The generic epithet Petrocardium is Greek in derivation and is said to be a combination of the words petro meaning \\"rock\\" and cardium which means \\"heart\\" and references the heart shaped nature of the leaf fossils in the rocks. The proper words for rock and heart in Greek are however œÄŒ≠œÑœÅŒ± (petra) and Œ∫Œ±œÅŒ¥ŒØŒ± (kardia).Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press. The specific epithet \\"wayuuorum\\" was chosen by the authors to honor the Wayuu Amerindian tribe which lives in the Rancheria Basin area of Colombia. The specific epithet \\"cerrejonense\\" is a derivation of Cerrej√≥n and reflects the type locality, the Cerrej√≥n Formation.  Description  Although several angiosperm families, such as Alismataceae, and Potamogetonaceae have leaf morphologies similar to Petrocardium, its lack of the primary vein structure found in those families excludes them as relatives. Petrocardium is placed as incertae sedis within the Araceae due to the unique combination of leaf morphology characteristics present in both species. Of the modern Araceae genera, Petrocardium is most similar to the modern tropical genus Anthurium in tribe Pothoeae. However it is not close in structure to the other three genera in the tribe, Pedicellarum, Pothoidium, and Pothos. This disparity lead the research team to leave the genus unplaced as to subfamily and tribe. Overall the genus possesses entire margined leaves with a generally ovate shape. The leaf apex is long and tapers to a point, while the base is heart to arrowhead shaped. The overall depositional environment, at an estimated paleolatitude of 5 degrees North, was that of sedimentation associated with a fluvial channel area formed within a Neotropical rainforest basin. = Petrocardium wayuuorum = The single known specimen of P. wayuuorum, ING-0902, was recovered from locality 0315, a by lens of fine grained sandstone in the Cerrej√≥n Formation. The specimen is missing the basal portion of the leaf but shows a smooth margin in the preserved regions of the leaf blade and was either cordate or sagittate. The overall size of the leaf was , and has a vein structure similar to that of Anthurium species that form secondary veins which group in single cluster of veins parallel to the outer margin of the leaf. This secondary vein structure is used to distinguish P. wayuuorum from P. cerrejonense. = Petrocardium cerrejonense = As with P. wayuuorum, P. cerrejonense is known from only one partial leaf and specimen ING-0804, is also from locality 0315. The specimen is incomplete with only portions of the tip and middle area of the leaf blade known. The overall size of the leaf was over , with an acuminate tip and smooth margin. P. cerrejonense has a vein structure similar to that of Anthurium species which form secondary veins which group into two clusters of veins parallel to the outer margin of the leaf and the secondary vein structure is used to distinguish P. cerrejonense from P. wayuuorum.

Classical Greece In Classical Athens, the word kyrios referred to the head of the household, who was responsible for his wife, children, and any unmarried female relatives. It was the responsibility of the kyrios to arrange the marriages of his female relatives, provide their dowries, represent them in court, if necessary, and deal with any economic transactions they were involved in worth more than a medimnos of barley. When an Athenian woman married, her husband became her new kyrios. The existence of the system of kurioi elsewhere in ancient Greece is debated, and the evidence is not clear-cut, but Cartledge has argued that in Sparta kurioi existed, although in Gortyn they do not appear to have done. The term \\"Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ\\" is still in use in the Modern Greek language and is the equivalent to the English terms \\"mister\\" (title conferred on an adult male), \\"master\\" (someone who has control over something or someone), and \\"sir\\" (an address to any male). For example, the English term \\"Mr. Smith\\" is translated to \\"Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ Œ£ŒºŒØŒ∏\\" (kyrios Smith) in Greek. New Testament Kyrios appears about 700 times in the New Testament, usually referring to Jesus. The use of kyrios in the New Testament has been the subject of debate among modern scholars, and three schools of thought exist on that topic. The first school is that based on the Septuagint usage, the designation is intended to assign to Jesus the Old Testament attributes of God. The reasoning here is that at the time that the Septuagint was written, when reading out loud Jews pronounced Adonai, the Hebrew word for \\"Lord\\", when they encountered the name of God, \\"YHWH\\", which was thus translated into Greek from 3rd century CE onwards in each instance as kyrios and theos.George Howard. \\"The Tetragram and the New Testament\\", included in The Anchor Bible Dictionary, Volume 6, Edited by David Noel Freedman Anchor Bible: New York. 1992 Also, the early Christians, the majority of whom were speakers of Greek, would have been deeply familiar with the Septuagint. The second school is that as the early Church expanded, Hellenistic influences resulted in the use of the term. The third is that it is a translation of the Aramaic title Mari applied to Jesus.Mercer dictionary of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 1998 pages 520-525 In everyday Aramaic, Mari was a very respectful form of polite address, well above \\"teacher\\" and similar to rabbi. In Greek this has at times been translated as kyrios. While the term Mari expressed the relationship between Jesus and his disciples during his life, Christians eventually came to interpret the Greek kyrios as representing lordship over the world.The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 page 202 The Gospel of John seldom uses kyrios to refer to Jesus during his ministry, but does so after the Resurrection, although the vocative kyrie (meaning sir) appears frequently.The theology of the Gospel of John by Dwight Moody Smith 1995 page 89 The Gospel of Mark never applies the term kyrios as a direct reference to Jesus, unlike Paul who uses it 163 times. When Mark uses kyrios (e.g., in 1:3, 11:9, 12:11, etc.) it is in reference to YHWH/God. Mark does, however, use the word in passages where it is unclear whether it applies to God or Jesus, e.g., in 5:19 or 11:3.The Gospel to the Romans: the setting and rhetoric of Mark's Gospel by Brian J. Incigneri 2003 pages 168-169 Kyrios is a key element of the Christology of Apostle Paul. Most scholars agree that the use of kyrios, and hence the Lordship of Jesus, predated the Pauline Epistles, but that Saint Paul expanded and elaborated on that topic. More than any other title, kyrios defined the relationship between Jesus and those who believed in him as Christ: Jesus was their Lord and Master who was to be served with all their hearts and who would one day judge their actions throughout their lives.II Corinthians: a commentary by Frank J. Matera 2003 pages 11-13 The kyrios title for Jesus is central to the development of New Testament Christology, for the early Christians placed it at the center of their understanding and from that center attempted to understand the other issues related to the Christian mysteries.Christology: Biblical And Historical by Mini S. Johnson, 2005 pages 229-235 kyrios is also essential in the development of the Trinity as well as New Testament Pneumatology (the study of the Holy Spirit). 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 says: > Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is > freedom. 18 And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the > Lord,[e] are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory > to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.2 Corinthians 3 > (ESV) The phrase \\"The Lord is the Spirit\\" in verse 17 is ·Ωâ Œ¥·Ω≤ ŒöœçœÅŒπŒøœÇ œÑ·Ω∏ Œ†ŒΩŒµ·ø¶ŒºŒ¨ (Ho de Kyrios to Pneuma). In verse 18 it is ŒöœÖœÅŒØŒøœÖ Œ†ŒΩŒµœçŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ (Kyriou Pneumatos). In some cases, when reading the Hebrew Bible, the Jews would substitute Adonai (my Lord) for the Tetragrammaton, and they may have also substituted Kurios when reading to a Greek audience. Origen refers to both practices in his commentary on Psalms (2.2). The practice was due to the desire not to overuse the name of God. Examples of this can be seen in Philo.Encountering the manuscripts: an introduction to New Testament paleography by Philip Comfort 2005 page 209 See also * Adonai * Dominus (title) * I am (biblical term) * Kyriarchy * Kyrie eleison * Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament * Pater familias * Theos Kyrios * Chi Rho References External links * Category:Ancient Greek titles Category:Christian terminology Category:Greek words and phrases Category:Septuagint words and phrases ","title":"Kyrios"},{"id":"29578266","text":"FC Dnepr Rogachev is a Belarusian football club based in Rogachev, Gomel Oblast.

He grew up in the rural valley of Myrkdalen in the parish of Vossestrand. He received musical training from local Hardanger fiddle players including Ola Mosafinn (1828‚Äì1912). In 1896, he won the first annual Norwegian folk music and dance competition (Vest landskappleiken) conducted at Bergen.

At the same time, the semi-permeable nature of the membrane prevents immune cells and antibodies from destroying the encapsulated cells regarding them as foreign invaders. The main motive of cell encapsulation technology is to overcome the existing problem of graft rejection in tissue engineering applications and thus reduce the need for long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs after an organ transplant to control side effects. Schematic illustrating cell microencapsulation.  History  In 1933 Vincenzo Bisceglie made the first attempt to encapsulate cells in polymer membranes. He demonstrated that tumor cells in a polymer structure transplanted into pig abdominal cavity remained viable for a long period without being rejected by the immune system. Thirty years later in 1964, the idea of encapsulating cells within ultra thin polymer membrane microcapsules so as to provide immunoprotection to the cells was then proposed by Thomas Chang who introduced the term \\"artificial cells\\" to define this concept of bioencapsulation. He suggested that these artificial cells produced by a drop method not only protected the encapsulated cells from immunorejection but also provided a high surface-to-volume relationship enabling good mass transfer of oxygen and nutrients. Twenty years later, this approach was successfully put into practice in small animal models when alginate-polylysine-alginate (APA) microcapsules immobilizing xenograft islet cells were developed. The study demonstrated that when these microencapsulated islets were implanted into diabetic rats, the cells remained viable and controlled glucose levels for several weeks. Human trials utilising encapsulated cells were performed in 1998. Encapsulated cells expressing a cytochrome P450 enzyme to locally activate an anti-tumour prodrug were used in a trial for advanced, non- resectable pancreatic cancer. Approximately a doubling of survival time compared to historic controls was demonstrated.  Cell microencapsulation as a tool for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine  Questions could arise as to why the technique of encapsulation of cells is even required when therapeutic products could just be injected at the site. An important reason for this is that the encapsulated cells would provide a source of sustained continuous release of therapeutic products for longer durations at the site of implantation. Another advantage of cell microencapsulation technology is that it allows the loading of non-human and genetically modified cells into the polymer matrix when the availability of donor cells is limited. Microencapsulation is a valuable technique for local, regional and oral delivery of therapeutic products as it can be implanted into numerous tissue types and organs. For prolonged drug delivery to the treatment site, implantation of these drug loaded artificial cells would be more cost effective in comparison to direct drug delivery. Moreover, the prospect of implanting artificial cells with similar chemical composition in several patients irrespective of their leukocyte antigen could again allow reduction in costs.  Key parameters of cell microencapsulation technology  The potential of using cell microencapsulation in successful clinical applications can be realized only if several requirements encountered during the development process are optimized such as the use of an appropriate biocompatible polymer to form the mechanically and chemically stable semi- permeable matrix, production of uniformly sized microcapsules, use of an appropriate immune-compatible polycations cross-linked to the encapsulation polymer to stabilized the capsules, selection of a suitable cell type depending on the situation. = Biomaterials = The use of the best biomaterial depending on the application is crucial in the development of drug delivery systems and tissue engineering. The polymer alginate is very commonly used due to its early discovery, easy availability and low cost but other materials such as cellulose sulphate, collagen, chitosan, gelatin and agarose have also been employed.  Alginate  Several groups have extensively studied several natural and synthetic polymers with the goal of developing the most suitable biomaterial for cell microencapsulation. Extensive work has been done using alginates which are regarded as the most suitable biomaterials for cell microencapsulation due to their abundance, excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability properties. Alginate is a natural polymer which can be extracted from seaweed and bacteria with numerous compositions based on the isolation source. Alginate is not free from all criticism. Some researchers believe that alginates with high-M content could produce an inflammatory response and an abnormal cell growth while some have demonstrated that alginate with high-G content lead to an even higher cell overgrowth and inflammatory reaction in vivo as compared to intermediate-G alginates. Even ultrapure alginates may contain endotoxins, and polyphenols which could compromise the biocompatibility of the resultant cell microcapsules. It has been shown that even though purification processes successfully lower endotoxin and polyphenol content in the processed alginate, it is difficult to lower the protein content and the purification processes could in turn modify the properties of the biomaterial. Thus it is essential that an effective purification process is designed so as to remove all the contaminants from alginate before it can be successfully used in clinical applications. =Modification and functionalization of alginate= Researchers have also been able to develop alginate microcapsules with an altered form of alginate with enhanced biocompatibility and higher resistance to osmotic swelling. Another approach to increasing the biocompatibility of the membrane biomaterial is through surface modification of the capsules using peptide and protein molecules which in turn controls the proliferation and rate of differentiation of the encapsulated cells. One group that has been working extensively on coupling the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) to alginate hydrogels demonstrated that the cell behavior can be controlled by the RGD density coupled on the alginate gels. Alginate microparticles loaded with myoblast cells and functionalized with RGD allowed control over the growth and differentiation of the loaded cells. Another vital factor that controls the use of cell microcapsules in clinical applications is the development of a suitable immune-compatible polycation to coat the otherwise highly porous alginate beads and thus impart stability and immune protection to the system. Poly-L-lysine is the most commonly used polycation but its low biocompatibility restricts the successful clinical use of these PLL formulated microcapsules which attract inflammatory cells thus inducing necrosis of the loaded cells. Studies have also shown that alginate-PLL-alginate (APA) microcapsules demonstrate low mechanical stability and short term durability. Thus several research groups have been looking for alternatives to PLL and have demonstrated promising results with poly-L-ornithine and poly(methylene- co-guanidine) hydrochloride by fabricating durable microcapsules with high and controlled mechanical strength for cell encapsulation. Several groups have also investigated the use of chitosan which is a naturally derived polycation as a potential replacement for PLL to fabricate alginate-chitosan (AC) microcapsules for cell delivery applications. However, studies have also shown that the stability of this AC membrane is again limited and one group demonstrated that modification of this alginate-chitosan microcapsules with genipin, a naturally occurring iridoid glucosid from gardenia fruits, to form genipin cross-linked alginate-chitosan (GCAC) microcapsules could augment stability of the cell loaded microcapsules. Microphotographs of the alginate- chitosan (AC) microcapsules. Collagen Collagen, a major protein component of the ECM, provides support to tissues like skin, cartilage, bones, blood vessels and ligaments and is thus considered a model scaffold or matrix for tissue engineering due to its properties of biocompatibility, biodegradability and ability to promote cell binding. This ability allows chitosan to control distribution of cells inside the polymeric system. Thus, Type-I collagen obtained from animal tissues is now successfully being used commercially as tissue engineered biomaterial for multiple applications. Collagen has also been used in nerve repair and bladder engineering. Immunogenicity has limited the applications of collagen. Gelatin has been considered as an alternative for that reason. Gelatin Gelatin is prepared from the denaturation of collagen and many desirable properties such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-immunogenity in physiological environments, and easy processability make this polymer a good choice for tissue engineering applications. It is used in engineering tissues for the skin, bone and cartilage and is used commercially for skin replacements. Chitosan Chitosan is a polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed Œ≤-(1-4)-linked D-glucosamine (deacetylated unit) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (acetylated unit). It is derived from the N-deacetylation of chitin and has been used for several applications such as drug delivery, space-filling implants and in wound dressings. However, one drawback of this polymer is its weak mechanical properties and is thus often combined with other polymers such collagen to form a polymer with stronger mechanical properties for cell encapsulation applications. Agarose Agarose is a polysaccharide derived from seaweed used for nanoencapsulation of cells and the cell/agarose suspensionVenkat Chokkalingam, Jurjen Tel, Florian Wimmers, Xin Liu, Sergey Semenov, Julian Thiele, Carl G.

However, one drawback with the microbeads so obtained is the possibility of cellular protrusion through the polymeric matrix wall after formation of the capsules.  Cellulose Sulphate  Cellulose sulphate is derived from cotton and, once processed appropriately, can be used as a biocompatible base in which to suspend cells. When the poly-anionic cellulose sulphate solution is immersed in a second, poly-cationic solution (e.g. pDADMAC), a semi-permeable membrane is formed around the suspended cells as a result of gelation between the two poly-ions. Both mammalian cell lines and bacterial cells remain viable and continue to replicate within the capsule membrane in order to fill-out the capsule. As such, in contrast to some other encapsulation materials, the capsules can be used to grow cells and act as such like a mini-bioreactor. The biocompatible nature of the material has been demonstrated by observation during studies using the cell-filled capsules themselves for implantation as well as isolated capsule material. Capsules formed from cellulose sulphate have been successfully used, showing safety and efficacy, in clinical and pre-clinical trials in both humans and animals, primarily as anti-cancer treatments, but also exploring possible uses for gene therapy or antibody therapies. Using cellulose sulphate it has been possible to manufacture encapsulated cells as a pharmaceutical product at large scale and fulfilling Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) standards. This was achieved by the company Austrianova in 2007. = Biocompatibility = The use of an ideal high quality biomaterial with the inherent properties of biocompatibility is the most crucial factor that governs the long term efficiency of this technology. An ideal biomaterial for cell encapsulation should be one that is totally biocompatible, does not trigger an immune response in the host and does not interfere with cell homeostasis so as to ensure high cell viability. However, one major limitation has been the inability to reproduce the different biomaterials and the requirements to obtain a better understanding of the chemistry and biofunctionality of the biomaterials and the microencapsulation system. Several studies demonstrate that surface modification of these cell containing microparticles allows control over the growth and cellular differentiation. of the encapsulated cells. One study proposed the use of zeta potential which measures the electric charge of the microcapsule as a means to predict the interfacial reaction between microcapsule and the surrounding tissue and in turn the biocompatibility of the delivery system. =Microcapsule permeability= A fundamental criterion that must be established while developing any device with a semi-permeable membrane is to adjust the permeability of the device in terms of entry and exit of molecules. It is essential that the cell microcapsule is designed with uniform thickness and should have a control over both the rate of molecules entering the capsule necessary for cell viability and the rate of therapeutic products and waste material exiting the capsule membrane. Immunoprotection of the loaded cell is the key issue that must be kept in mind while working on the permeability of the encapsulation membrane as not only immune cells but also antibodies and cytokines should be prevented entry into the microcapsule which in fact depends on the pore size of the biomembrane. It has been shown that since different cell types have different metabolic requirements, thus depending on the cell type encapsulated in the membrane the permeability of the membrane has to be optimized. Several groups have been dedicated towards the study of membrane permeability of cell microcapsules and although the role of permeability of certain essential elements like oxygen has been demonstrated, the permeability requirements of each cell type are yet to be determined. Sodium Citrate is used for degradation of alginate beads after encapsulation of cells. In order to determine viability of the cells or for further experimentation. Concentrations of approximately 25mM are used to dissolve the alginate spheres and the solution is spun down using a centrifuge so the sodium citrate can be removed and the cells can be collected. =Mechanical strength and durability= It is essential that the microcapsules have adequate membrane strength (mechanical stability) to endure physical and osmotic stress such as during the exchange of nutrients and waste products. The microcapsules should be strong enough and should not rupture on implantation as this could lead to an immune rejection of the encapsulated cells. For instance, in the case of xenotransplantation, a tighter more stable membrane would be required in comparison to allotransplantation. Also, while investigating the potential of using APA microcapsules loaded with bile salt hydrolase (BSH) overproducing active Lactobacillus plantarum 80 cells, in a simulated gastro intestinal tract model for oral delivery applications, the mechanical integrity and shape of the microcapsules was evaluated. It was shown that APA microcapsules could potentially be used in the oral delivery of live bacterial cells. However, further research proved that the GCAC microcapsules possess a higher mechanical stability as compared to APA microcapsules for oral delivery applications. Martoni et al. were experimenting with bacteria-filled capsules that would be taken by mouth to reduce serum cholesterol. The capsules were pumped through a series of vessels simulating the human GI tract to determine how well the capsules would survive in the body. Extensive research into the mechanical properties of the biomaterial to be used for cell microencapsulation is necessary to determine the durability of the microcapsules during production and especially for in vivo applications where a sustained release of the therapeutic product over long durations is required. van der Wijngaart et al. grafted a solid, but permeable, shell around the cells to provide increased mechanical strength.

A source of high voltage usually provided by a clamp attached to the needle is used to generate an electric potential with the alginate falling from the needle tip into a solution that contains a ground. Calcium chloride is used as cross linking solution in which the generated capsules drop into where they harden after approximately 30 minutes. Beads are formed from the needle due to charge and surface tension. * Size dependency of the beads  height alterations of device from needle to calcium chloride solution  voltage alterations of clamp on the needle  alginate concentration alterations =Microcapsule size= The diameter of the microcapsules is an important factor that influences both the immune response towards the cell microcapsules as well as the mass transport across the capsule membrane. Studies show that the cellular response to smaller capsules is much lesser as compared to larger capsules and in general the diameter of the cell loaded microcapsules should be between 350-450 ¬µm so as to enable effective diffusion across the semi-permeable membrane. =Cell choice= The cell type chosen for this technique depends on the desired application of the cell microcapsules. The cells put into the capsules can be from the patient (autologous cells), from another donor (allogeneic cells) or from other species (xenogeneic cells). The use of autologous cells in microencapsulation therapy is limited by the availability of these cells and even though xenogeneic cells are easily accessible, danger of possible transmission of viruses, especially porcine endogenous retrovirus to the patient restricts their clinical application, and after much debate several groups have concluded that studies should involve the use of allogeneic instead of xenogeneic cells. Depending on the application, the cells can be genetically altered to express any required protein. However, enough research has to be carried out to validate the safety and stability of the expressed gene before these types of cells can be used. This technology has not received approval for clinical trial because of the high immunogenicity of cells loaded in the capsules. They secrete cytokines and produce a severe inflammatory reaction at the implantation site around the capsules, in turn leading to a decrease in viability of the encapsulated cells. One promising approach being studied is the administration of anti- inflammatory drugs to reduce the immune response produced due to administration of the cell loaded microcapsules. Another approach which is now the focus of extensive research is the use of stem cells such as mesenchymal stem cells for long term cell microencapsulation and cell therapy applications in hopes of reducing the immune response in the patient after implantation. Another issue which compromises long term viability of the microencapsulated cells is the use of fast proliferating cell lines which eventually fill up the entire system and lead to decrease in the diffusion efficiency across the semi-permeable membrane of the capsule. A solution to this could be in the use of cell types such as myoblasts which do not proliferate after the microencapsulation procedure. Non-Therapeutic Applications Probiotics are increasingly being used in numerous dairy products such as ice cream, milk powders, yoghurts, frozen dairy desserts and cheese due to their important health benefits. But, low viability of probiotic bacteria in the food still remains a major hurdle. The pH, dissolved oxygen content, titratable acidity, storage temperature, species and strains of associative fermented dairy product organisms and concentration of lactic and acetic acids are some of the factors that greatly affect the probiotic viability in the product. As set by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO), the standard in order to be considered a health food with probitic addition, the product should contain per gram at least 106-107 cfu of viable probiotic bacteria. It is necessary that the bacterial cells remain stable and healthy in the manufactured product, are sufficiently viable while moving through the upper digestive tract and are able to provide positive effects upon reaching the intestine of the host. Cell microencapsulation technology has successfully been applied in the food industry for the encapsulation of live probiotic bacteria cells to increase viability of the bacteria during processing of dairy products and for targeted delivery to the gastrointestinal tract. Apart from dairy products, microencapsulated probiotics have also been used in non-dairy products, such as TheresweetTM which is a sweetener. It can be used as a convenient vehicle for delivery of encapsulated Lactobacillus to the intestine although it is not itself a dairy product. Therapeutic Applications =Diabetes= The potential of using bioartificial pancreas, for treatment of diabetes mellitus, based on encapsulating islet cells within a semi permeable membrane is extensively being studied by scientists. These devices could eliminate the need for of immunosuppressive drugs in addition to finally solving the problem of shortage of organ donors. The use of microencapsulation would protect the islet cells from immune rejection as well as allow the use of animal cells or genetically modified insulin-producing cells. It is hoped that development of these islet encapsulated microcapsules could prevent the need for the insulin injections needed several times a day by type 1 diabetic patients. The Edmonton protocol involves implantation of human islets extracted from cadaveric donors and has shown improvements towards the treatment of type 1 diabetics who are prone to hypoglycemic unawareness. However, the two major hurdles faced in this technique are the limited availability of donor organs and with the need for immunosuppresents to prevent an immune response in the patient's body. Several studies have been dedicated towards the development of bioartificial pancreas involving the immobilization of islets of Langerhans inside polymeric capsules. The first attempt towards this aim was demonstrated in 1980 by Lim et al. where xenograft islet cells were encapsulated inside alginate polylysine microcapsules and showed significant in vivo results for several weeks. It is envisaged that the implantation of these encapsulated cells would help to overcome the use of immunosuppressive drugs and also allow the use of xenograft cells thus obviating the problem of donor shortage. The polymers used for islet microencapsulation are alginate, chitosan, polyethylene glycol (PEG), agarose, sodium cellulose sulfate and water- insoluble polyacrylates with alginate and PEG being commonly used polymers. With successful in vitro studies being performed using this technique, significant work in clinical trials using microencapsulated human islets is being carried out. In 2003, the use of alginate/PLO microcapsules containing islet cells for pilot phase-1 clinical trials was permitted to be carried out at the University of Perugia by the Italian Ministry of Health. In another study, the potential of clinical application of PEGylation and low doses of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A were evaluated. The trial which began in 2005 by Novocell, now forms the phase I/II of clinical trials involving implantation of islet allografts into the subcutaneous site. However, there have been controversial studies involving human clinical trials where Living Cell technologies Ltd demonstrated the survival of functional xenogeneic cells transplanted without immunosuppressive medication for 9.5 years. However, the trial received harsh criticism from the International Xenotransplantation Association as being risky and premature. However, even though clinical trials are under way, several major issues such as biocompatibility and immunoprotection need to be overcome. Potential alternatives to encapsulating isolated islets (of either allo- or xenogeneic origin) are also being explored. Using sodium cellulose sulphate technology from Austrianova Singapore an islet cell line was encapsulated and it was demonstrated that the cells remain viable and release insulin in response to glucose. In pre- clinical studies, implanted, encapsulated cells were able to restore blood glucose levels in diabetic rats over a period of 6 months. =Cancer= The use of cell encapsulated microcapsules towards the treatment of several forms of cancer has shown great potential. One approach undertaken by researchers is through the implantation of microcapsules containing genetically modified cytokine secreting cells. An example of this was demonstrated by Cirone et al. when genetically modified IL-2 cytokine secreting non-autologous mouse myoblasts implanted into mice showed a delay in the tumor growth with an increased rate of survival of the animals. However, the efficiency of this treatment was brief due to an immune response towards the implanted microcapsules. Another approach to cancer suppression is through the use of angiogenesis inhibitors to prevent the release of growth factors which lead to the spread of tumors. The effect of implanting microcapsules loaded with xenogenic cells genetically modified to secrete endostatin, an antiangiogenic drug which causes apoptosis in tumor cells, has been extensively studied. However, this method of local delivery of microcapsules was not feasible in the treatment of patients with many tumors or in metastasis cases and has led to recent studies involving systemic implantation of the capsules. In 1998, a murine model of pancreatic cancer was used to study the effect of implanting genetically modified cytochrome P450 expressing feline epithelial cells encapsulated in cellulose sulfate polymers for the treatment of solid tumors. The approach demonstrated for the first time the application of enzyme expressing cells to activate chemotherapeutic agents. On the basis of these results, an encapsulated cell therapy product, NovaCaps, was tested in a phaseI/II clinical trial for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in patients and has recently been designated by the European medicines agency (EMEA) as an orphan drug in Europe. A further phase I/II clinical trial using the same product confirmed the results of the first trial, demonstrating an approximate doubling of survival time in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer. In all of these trials using cellulose sulphate, in addition to the clear anti-tumour effects, the capsules were well tolerated and there were no adverse reactions seen such as immune response to the capsules, demonstrating the biocompatible nature of the cellulose sulphate capsules. In one patient the capsules were in place for almost 2 years with no side effects. These studies show the promising potential application of cell microcapsules towards the treatment of cancers. However, solutions to issues such as immune response leading to inflammation of the surrounding tissue at the site of capsule implantation have to be researched in detail before more clinical trials are possible. =Heart Diseases= Numerous studies have been dedicated towards the development of effective methods to enable cardiac tissue regeneration in patients after ischemic heart disease. An emerging approach to answer the problems related to ischemic tissue repair is through the use of stem cell- based therapy. However, the actual mechanism due to which this stem cell-based therapy has generative effects on cardiac function is still under investigation. Even though numerous methods have been studied for cell administration, the efficiency of the number of cells retained in the beating heart after implantation is still very low. A promising approach to overcome this problem is through the use of cell microencapsulation therapy which has shown to enable a higher cell retention as compared to the injection of free stem cells into the heart. Another strategy to improve the impact of cell based encapsulation technique towards cardiac regenerative applications is through the use of genetically modified stem cells capable of secreting angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which stimulate neovascularization and restore perfusion in the damaged ischemic heart. An example of this is shown in the study by Zang et al. where genetically modified xenogeneic CHO cells expressing VEGF were encapsulated in alginate-polylysine-alginate microcapsules and implanted into rat myocardium. It was observed that the encapsulation protected the cells from an immunorespone for three weeks and also led to an improvement in the cardiac tissue post-infarction due to increased angiogenesis. =Monoclonal Antibody Therapy= The use of monoclonal antibodies for therapy is now widespread for treatment of cancers and inflammatory diseases. Using cellulose sulphate technology, scientists have successfully encapsulated antibody producing hybridoma cells and demonstrated subsequent release of the therapeutic antibody from the capsules. The capsules containing the hybridoma cells were used in pre-clinical studies to deliver neutralising antibodies to the mouse retrovirus FrCasE, successfully preventing disease. =Other conditions= Many other medical conditions have been targeted with encapsulation therapies, especially those involving a deficiency in some biologically derived protein. One of the most successful approaches is an external device that acts similarly to a dialysis machine, only with a reservoir of pig hepatocytes surrounding the semipermeable portion of the blood-infused tubing. This apparatus can remove toxins from the blood of patients suffering severe liver failure. Other applications that are still in development include cells that produce ciliary-derived neurotrophic factor for the treatment of ALS and Huntington's disease, glial-derived neurotrophic factor for Parkinson's disease, erythropoietin for anemia, and HGH for dwarfism. In addition, monogeneic diseases such as haemophilia, Gaucher's disease and some mucopolysaccharide disorders could also potentially be targeted by encapsulated cells expressing the protein that is otherwise lacking in the patient.

Calomiris spent seven years undercover in the party from February 1942 until April 26, 1949, when she was called to testify in the trial of eleven CPUSA leaders, who were convicted of conspiracy to advocate the overthrow of the US government on October 13, 1949. Background The daughter of Greek immigrants, Calomiris was born in New York City on August 1, 1916, and grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Her father was a furrier, who lost his job during the Great Depression and was forced to support his family through menial labor. Calomiris attended Brooklyn College and Hunter College of the City University of New York for two years, and decided to become a professional photographer, having fallen in love with photography as a child. Career Gay Street in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, where Calomiris lived After her studies, Calomiris took up residence in Greenwich Village and \\"instead of buying food, she saved money to buy a camera\\". She worked for Broadway photographer Hal Phyfe and also joined the Photo League, a group of amateur photographic enthusiasts, which included a number of communists among its members. Sid Grossman, director of the Photo League's school, recruited her; Leona Saron was the Party operative to whom she first reported. =FBI Informant= In February 1942, Calomiris was approached by two FBI agents, who asked her if she would be willing to infiltrate the CPUSA as an informant. The agents told her that she would receive neither money nor glory for her work, and that she would be disavowed if discovered, possibly putting her in personal danger, but Calomiris accepted their offer anyway after a week of deliberation. In the end she was well paid and earned a respectable pay check despite claims to the contrary.Mahoney, pp. 37‚Äì38 When asked about her decision in 1950, Calomiris told The New York Times that she accepted the offer because she \\"kind of wanted to be a hero.\\" Her FBI handlers advised her to \\"never act conspiratorially or try to pry into party secrets\\", but rather to simply gather and report whatever information came her way. A few weeks after meeting with the FBI, Calomiris attended a lecture about Soviet efforts in World War II, where she was recruited by communist organizers.Mahoney, p. 38 She then agreed to join the party, but was advised by her communist recruiters that she should take an assumed name for security reasons and chose the name Angela Cole. Calomiris then rose quickly through the ranks of the party by volunteering for jobs that no one else wanted to do.Mahoney, p. 39 Over her time in the party, she served as educational director, branch organizer, and co-section organizer of the West Midtown Branch of the CPUSA, before rising to the position of finance secretary. As finance secretary, Calomiris had access to extensive information on party members, including the real names of all members of the branch and the leaders of the national party, and passed all of this information to the FBI. Throughout the time that Calomiris served as an informant, she supported herself as a professional photographer, specializing in animal photographs, but the FBI also paid her a salary (a fact which Calomiris later denied) and covered her expenses, including Communist Party dues. =Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders= Robert G. Thompson and Benjamin J. Davis, two of the defendants Calomiris identified, leaving the courthouse during the Foley Square trial During World War II, the US Department of Justice avoided prosecuting American communists, to avoid antagonizing the Soviet Union, then a military ally. After the end of the war, they began compiling a case against the leadership of the CPUSA, using evidence from informants, including Calomiris. John McGohey, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, was given the lead role in prosecuting the cases and, under the Smith Act, presented charges against twelve communist leaders on July 20, 1948. The defendants were then indicted by a grand jury and arrested. After the arrests, Calomiris remained undercover, and continued her activities within the Party. When the trial of the communist leaders began in January, she travelled to Washington, D.C., to join a protest against the prosecutions. She also donated $50 in government money to the legal defense fund for the defendants, and was asked to help plan their legal strategy, but refused. During the trial, the prosecution decided to use Calomiris as a surprise witness and on April 26, she \\"stunned\\" the defendants by taking the stand for the prosecution. In her testimony, Calomiris identified four of the defendants, John Williamson, Benjamin J. Davis, Robert G. Thompson, and Gil Green as members of the Communist Party and provided information on its organization. She also testified that the Party espoused violent revolution against the government and that the Party had attempted to recruit members working in key war industries, on instructions from Moscow. Calomiris was then cross-examined so harshly by the defense, that the presiding judge Harold Medina rebuked the defense attorney, but the questioning \\"failed to shake her testimony.\\" Around the time of the trial, Calomiris also began dating Myrtis Johnson, the sister- in-law of her FBI handler, Ken Bierly, a fact that attracted attention from the media.Davis, p. 625 =Celebrity after the trial= Eleanor Roosevelt (here, speaking at the United Nations in July 1947), invited Calomiris to her radio talk show The defendants in the Foley Square trial were convicted on October 13, 1949, and Calomiris became a minor celebrity as the result of her role in the proceedings. She capitalized on the fame by writing an autobiography, Red Masquerade: Undercover for the FBI, which was published by Lippincott in 1950. George Scharsburg of the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote that the book was \\"well worth reading\\" and A.H. Raskin of The New York Times praised it for being \\"as interesting for its insight into the problems that best a Government 'plant' in the party as it is for the light it throws on the jealousies, personal intrigues and divisions that exist behind the party's monolithic facade\\", but Richard Donnelly criticized the book in The Yale Law Journal for being \\"rather pretentious\\". After the publication of her book, Calomiris went on a number of talk radio shows, appearing most notably on former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt's show on NBC, Today with Mrs. Roosevelt, where Roosevelt praised Calomiris as \\"a young lady of great courage.\\"Davis, p. 623 During the same period, Calomiris continued to work with the FBI, providing information on a communist lesbian policewoman named Yetta Cohn, which resulted in the firing of Cohn and another woman.Davis, p. 630 =Later life= Calomiris's celebrity status soon began to evaporate, and a number of potential television and movie projects fell through as did offers of a photography job. Around the same time, Calomiris broke up with Myrtis Johnson, and fell out with many of her friends in the New York lesbian community, who disapproved of her decision to give the FBI information on Cohn. Calomiris then left New York, opening a bed and breakfast in Provincetown, Massachusetts, in the 1960s. Arriving at the start of Provincetown's transition from fishing village to seaside resort, Calomiris bought a number of prime properties, including the rooming house at 353 Commercial St. that she named Angels' Landing, which still exists today, memorializing the FBI spy.Davis, p. 630-31 Death Calomiris died on January 30, 1995, in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.Wilson, p. 65 Legacy Exhibitions of Calomiris' work include: *November 4, 2011 - March 25, 2012 \\"The Radical Camera: New York's Photo League, 1936-1951\\" at Jewish Museum (New York) *March 19 - May 9, 2009 \\"The Women of the Photo League\\" at Higher Pictures Gallery, New York City In 2008, Veronica Wilson published \\"Red Masquerades: Gender and Political Subversion during the Cold War, 1945-1963,\\" as her PhD Dissertation at Rutgers University.

Mark Wood was the eldest son of Alexander Wood of Perth, descended from the family of the Woods of Largo, to the estates of which Alexander succeeded on the death of his cousin, John Wood, sometime governor of the Isle of Man. Mark became a cadet of the East India Company's army in 1770, and went to India with his brother George (afterwards a major-general of the Indian army and K.C.B.), who died in 1824. Another brother was Sir James Athol Wood. He received his first commission on 7 July 1772 in the Bengal engineers, and rose to be colonel 26 February 1795. After a distinguished career in India, culminating in his appointment as surveyor-general in 1787 and chief engineer of Bengal in 1790, he returned to England on account of ill-health in 1793, and purchased Piercefield House on the banks of the Wye. Wood entered the House of Commons for Milborne Port, Somerset, in 1794; he was returned for Newark in 1796, after a severe contest with Sir William Paxton. In 1795 he was brought into the king's service as a colonel, and in an audience he had that year with George III to present a model in ivory of Fort William, Calcutta, the king expressed to him a desire for the union of the East India Company and the royal services. In 1802 he was unsuccessful in a contest with Robert Hurst for the representation of Shaftesbury, and was in consequence returned for his pocket borough of Gatton, Surrey, the domain of which (Gatton Park) he had recently purchased. He was created a baronet on 3 October 1808. He continued to represent Gatton until the dissolution in 1818, when he retired from public life, having given a uniform support to the measures of Pitt and subsequently of Lord Liverpool. He died on 6 February 1829 at his house in Pall Mall, London and was buried on 13 February in Gatton church, where there is a tablet to his memory.

The acceleration was almost a full second faster than the XT600, which was due to the lower weight and lower gearing.

Although initially checked it was a British victory. Prelude On 3 April the British force reached the position next to Seringapatam in which General Abercromby had encamped in 1792, on the south-west side of the island and prepared to besiege the place. During the time which had intervened since Lord Cornwallis's siege of Seringapatam (1792), the Sultan had given great attention to strengthening the fortifications. But, excepting a battery which he had erected on the north- west angle of the fort, his improvements had been mainly directed to the south and east sides. The works on the west side where the wall overlooks the K√°veri were not so strong, although even here they were protected by a double wall and a ditch. In front of the British army was broken rising ground intersected by deep ditches, with some deserted villages, and several topes (groves) of areca-nut palms and cocoa trees, which afforded a safe cover to Tipu's skirmishers and rocket-men. An aqueduct within of the fortress, near a wooded tope called the Sultanpet Tope or \\"Sultaunpet\\", afforded Tippoo's skirmishers and rocketmen firing rocket artillery a safe cover from which they most seriously annoyed the British outposts. General Baird was directed to scour this grove and dislodge the enemy, but on his advancing with this object on the night of 4/5 April, he found the tope unoccupied. Battle During the day, the Mysore troops reoccupied the position, and as it was absolutely necessary to expel them, two columns were detached at sunset on 5 April for the purpose. The first of these columns, under Colonel Shawe, took possession of a ruined village, which it successfully held. The second column, under Colonel Wellesley, on advancing into the tope, was at once attacked in the darkness of night by a tremendous fire of musketry and rockets. The men, floundering about amidst the trees and the water-courses, at last broke, and fell back in disorder, some being killed and a few taken prisoners. In the confusion Colonel Wellesley was struck on the knee by a spent ball, and narrowly escaped being captured by the enemy. The second attack with four regiments, also under the command of Wellesley, succeeded in taking possession of the grove on the morning of 6 April. This allowed British forces to advance within of Seringapatam, and General Harris was able to proceed with his siege- operations, the army taking up its final position on 7 April.

It was first released in 1987. The stories =Pink Bow Tie= A pupil is in trouble for dyeing his hair white. He explains to his principal the events of the previous day that led to his hair changing color, involving an age-altering device that a man accidentally kills himself with. Was later adapted as an episode of Round The Twist. =One-Shot Toothpaste= A dentist tells one of his patients the story of how he became a dentist in spite of wanting to be a dustman: one of his neighbors, despite being nearly toothless, always had his bin full of toothpaste which he tested on locked-up animals. This toothpaste is supposed to make sure people never have to clean their teeth again, but has a horrible taste. The old man gets a taste of his own medicine and transforms into a giant tooth, which the patients think becomes the dentist's sign. The story ends with the dentist telling a similar story to another child of how he became a dentist in spite of wanting to be a ballerina, revealing that the story is made up. =There's No Such Thing= An old man is forced to go to a nursing home. He can only leave if he can prove the existence of a dragon, so he sends his grandson into the sewers to take photos of the dragon. The grandson returns with a box which turns out to be a dragon egg from which a baby dragon hatches. Was later adapted as an episode of Round the Twist, was one of two adaptions to be combined into one episode. =Inside Out= A boy who is a fan of horror films and isn't scared of anything leaves his sister at home alone for a night because she has stolen his rented scary movie. He decides to rest for a night at an old house, but it turns out to be the home of a student spook who has an upcoming exam; if the student fails his exam to scare the boy, he'll be frozen for a whole year until the next exam. Was later loosely adapted as an episode of Round The Twist. =The Busker= A boy needs money because he wants to go on a date. When his father refuses, he spends the night to find a job so he can get the money. However, he meets an old man who tells him a story of how he worked as a busker when he was younger with his only friend, a little dog named Tiny. He becomes so desperate for friendship that when he wins the lotto and becomes rich, he tries giving the money to people so they will like him. Too late, he realizes that money can never buy true friendship, and that he never appreciated the only real friend he ever had. =Souperman= A boy who spends his whole school time reading Superman comics is forced to throw them away by his father due to his failing school grades. He then meets a man who resembles Superman, but this superhero gets his powers by drinking soup. =The Gumleaf War= A boy gets his nose stretched in an accident and is sent to his grandfather's house in the country to take his mind off it. However, his grandfather is embroiled in a decades-long feud with another old man, as they are able to transfer illnesses to each other by blowing into magic gumleaves. Later a bushfire burns the tree which had the magic leaves on it. The boy blows the last leaf and his stretched nose is gone. This was later adapted as an episode of Round The Twist. In Round The Twist a girl stretches her nose when being scared by her brothers - she falls down the tree and later she goes to the hospital and they say they can't fix her nose for three years. She doesn't want to go back to school so she goes to her grandmother's house for some time. Her grandmother is embroiled in a decades-long feud with another old man, (Foxy). There happened to be a bad bushfire that year and the grandmother helped Foxy. Later they talk about a gum tree and then they yell \\"THE GUM TREE!\\" when they arrive at the gum tree there is only one leaf left and the girl gets it and Foxy and the girl's grandmother and yelling \\"give it here!\\" So she runs and plays the song Click Go the Shears, and passes the stretched nose to her parents who were there at the time and then she lost her stretched nose and her brothers and father had stretched noses. The reason why Foxy and her grandmother didn't get the injury was because they had ear plugs in. After she leaves on the train she hears the park ranger say that gum leaf trees grow back. She screams and wakes up in the hospital she asks her parents to take off their masks. They do as told and their noses are the same and then before it ends there is a gum leaf in her hand. =Birdscrap= Twin girls walk to an old house where their late father has hidden rubies. Along the way, they are attacked by seagulls. Was later adapted as an episode of Round The Twist, was one of two adaptions to be combined into one episode. =Snookle= A boy finds a milk bottle with a pair of eyes inside. The trapped creature (who the boy calls snookle) is freed by the boy and becomes his servant - however, the boy soon discovers that his new servant helps him far too much, before giving the creature to an old woman who needs a lot of help.

Efficient logistics, the management of personnel and materiel, supported United Nations (UN) supply lines while the North Koreans' routes of supply were steadily reduced and cut off. UN logistics improved throughout the Battle of Inchon and the defeat of the North Korean army at Pusan. UN forces, consisting primarily of troops from the Republic of Korea (ROK), the United States (US), and United Kingdom (UK), enjoyed overwhelming air and sea superiority during the battle. The UN efficiently procured and transported supplies from a large stockpile of materiel in nearby Japan. In contrast, North Korean logistics were hampered by UN interdiction campaigns which slowed the flow of supplies from North Korea to the battle. Though supported logistically by the Soviet Union and China during the battle, North Koreans often had difficulties getting their supplies from depots to the front lines, leaving North Korean troops unsupported during several crucial engagements.  Background  = Outbreak of war = On the night of June 25, 1950, ten divisions of North Korea's Korean People's Army (KPA) launched a full-scale invasion on the nation's neighbor to the south, the Republic of Korea. The force of 89,000 men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise, resulting in a complete rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and it was unprepared for war. Numerically superior, North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000 South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south. Most of South Korea's forces retreated in the face of the invasion. By June 28, the North Koreans had captured South Korea's capital of Seoul, forcing the government and its shattered army to retreat further south. To prevent South Korea's complete collapse, the United Nations Security Council voted to send military forces. The United States' Seventh Fleet dispatched Task Force 77, led by the fleet carrier USS Valley Forge; the British Far East Fleet also dispatched several ships, including HMS Triumph, to provide air and naval support. Although the navies blockaded North Korea and launched aircraft to delay the North Korean forces, these efforts alone did not stop the North Korean Army juggernaut on its southern advance. To supplement the air support, US President Harry S. Truman ordered ground troops into the country. Although the Eighth United States Army's US 24th Infantry Division was in Japan and was available to respond to the situation, cuts in military spending after the end of World War II meant that the overall strength of the US military in the Far East was limited and the division itself was understrength and operating outmoded equipment. Nevertheless, the division was ordered into Korea. The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial \\"shock\\" of North Korean advances alongside the South Korean army, delaying much larger North Korean units to buy time to allow UN reinforcements to arrive. The division was consequently alone for several weeks as it attempted to delay the North Koreans while the 7th Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division, and other Eighth Army supporting units moved into position. On July 5, during the first battle between American and North Korean forces, advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated at Osan. Over the course of the following month, the 24th Infantry Division was repeatedly defeated and forced south by the stronger and more heavily equipped North Koreans. During this time heavy fighting occurred around Chochiwon, Chonan, and Pyongtaek before the 24th Infantry Division made a final stand at Taejon. Although they were almost completely destroyed in the fighting, the US troops were able to delay North Korean advance until July 20, by which time the Pusan Perimeter had been established. With UN units arriving every day, the Eighth Army was able to build up a force of combat troops that were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region. = North Korean advance = With Taejon captured, North Korean forces began the effort of surrounding the Pusan Perimeter from all sides in an attempt to envelop it. The North Korean 4th Infantry Division and the North Korean 6th Infantry Division advanced south in a wide coordinated maneuver that was aimed at the UN's left flank. Advancing on UN positions, they repeatedly forced US and South Korean forces to withdraw. Although they were steadily pushed back, South Korean forces increased their resistance further south in an effort to delay North Korean units as much as possible. North and South Korean units sparred for control of several cities, inflicting heavy casualties on one another. The Republic of Korea Army forces defended Yongdok fiercely before being forced back. They also performed well in the Battle of Andong, where they were successful in repelling North Korean advances. In the west, US forces were pushed back repeatedly before finally halting the North Korean advance. Forces from the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, leaving open a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, Chinju to the west was taken, pushing the 19th Infantry Regiment back and leaving routes to the Pusan open for North Korean forces. US units were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the North Korean force on the west flank withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides several days of reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.  United Nations logistics  Pusan harbor, where the majority of UN supplies were processed, in 1950. On July 1, the US Far East Command directed the Eighth United States Army to assume responsibility for all logistical support of the United Nations Command (UNC) in Korea. This included the ROK Army, US Army and British Army forces operating in Korea. It also included support for the ships of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the Netherlands which were also contributing to the effort. When the Eighth Army became operational in Korea, this logistical function was assumed by Eighth Army Rear which remained behind in Yokohama, Japan. This dual role of the Eighth Army‚Äîthat of combat in Korea and of logistical support for all troops fighting there‚Äîled to the designation of that part of the army in Korea as Eighth United States Army in Korea. This situation existed until August 25. On that date the Far East Command activated the Japan Logistical Command with Major General Walter L. Weible in command. It took over the logistical duties previously held by Eighth Army Rear. It also assumed responsibility of the movement of refugees and prisoners of war. The supplies needed to support the American and South Korean armies came through the United States and Japan. Whatever could be obtained from stocks in Japan or procured from Japanese manufacturers was obtained there. In early July 1950, Japanese manufacturers began making antitank mines and on July 18 a shipment of 3,000 of them arrived by boat at Pusan. The equipment and ordnance supplies that was available to the United States forces in Korea in the first months of the war was largely due to the \\"roll-up\\" plan of the Far East Command which had been in effect for some time before the outbreak of hostilities. It called for the reclamation of ordnance items from World War II in the US Pacific island outposts and their repair or reconstruction in Japan. This plan had been conceived and started in 1948 by Brigadier General Urban Niblo, the senior Ordnance Officer of the Far East Command. During July and August 1950 an average of 4,000 automotive vehicles cleared through the ordnance repair shops each month; in the year after the outbreak of the Korean War more than 46,000 automotive vehicles were repaired or rebuilt in Japan. = Challenges = The re-equipping of the ROK Army presented the UN forces with a large logistical problem in July. To meet part of the requirements, the US command contracted Japanese manufacturers in August to produce 68,000 vehicles for the ROK Army, mostly cargo and dump trucks, with first deliveries to be made in September. However, the largest challenge faced by UN forces was a shortage of ammunition. At the outbreak of the war and up until the Pusan Perimeter engagements, the UNC's forces had to rely mainly upon stock of World War II surplus ammunition. Much of this malfunctioned or no longer worked, indeed in some cases up to 60 percent did not work, and as a result ammunition, particularly for crew-served weapons, was frequently in short supply. From the outset, High Explosive Anti Tank ammunition was particularly scarce, but this changed as US and Japanese manufacturers increased production to meet wartime needs, as a part of the Far East Command's \\"Operation Rebuild\\". By August 1950 this operation had assumed gigantic proportions and before the end of 1950 it had expanded to employ 19,908 people in eight Japanese shops. Through these efforts, UNC logistics situations improved over time, but nevertheless ammunition remained in short supply for much of the war. Another issue that strained the UN logistics system was the lack of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units and as a result of a lack of coordination, some UN units faced supply shortages when other units would request more material than they actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose. The lack of armor available was also a serious issue of the UNC. In order to meet the demand, a variety of armored old platforms were hastily rebuilt and modified for movement into the Pusan Perimeter. M4A3 Sherman medium tanks (preferably the most advanced model, the M4A3E8 (76)W HVSS Sherman) from World War II were pulled from stocks and rebuilt for use in Korea. M15A1 Half-tracks were also rebuilt and modified for use in Korea. During early engagements, the M24 Chaffee light tank was the primary armored vehicle used by the Americans because it was most readily available and most combat-ready; nevertheless, it performed poorly against heavier North Korean armor. All of these weapons had been used in World War II and were considered in poor condition. The appearance of the North Korean T-34 tanks forced the US to move large numbers of heavier, more powerful tanks into the battle. During August, six tank battalions, with around 69 tanks each, arrived at Pusan. By the end of the month there were more than 500 UN tanks assembled there. Most were M4A3E8 Shermans, and the bigger M26 Pershing heavy tanks, although a limited number of the new M46 Patton tanks were also moved into the perimeter. On July 9, the US 2nd Infantry Division, with several armor and antiaircraft artillery units, was ordered to proceed to the Far East. The next day, MacArthur requested that the 2nd Division be brought to full war strength, if possible, without delaying its departure. He also reiterated his need of the units required to bring the four infantry divisions already in the Far East to full war strength. He detailed these as four heavy tank battalions, 12 heavy tank companies, 11 infantry battalions, 11 field artillery battalions, and four antiaircraft automatic weapons battalions per division. By August 7, the US 9th Infantry Regiment was operational in Korea, and had been sent to the Naktong Bulge area. However it would be the end of the month before the rest of the 2nd Infantry Division arrived in Korea. After World War II, the Army developed the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) concept from experiences in the European Theater. The US Army sought a highly mobile hospital unit which could be as close to the fighting as possible to increase the survival rate of casualties. These 60-bed, 124-man units would act as mobile hospitals for the treatment of wounded. By the beginning of the hostilities in Korea, all MASH units were undermanned and the difficult terrain in Korea prevented easy transport, making it very difficult for the MASH units to operate in the Pusan Perimeter battle. The 8055th MASH was the first such unit to arrive in Korea, being assigned to the 24th Infantry Division on July 9. Two more hospitals, the 8063rd and 8067th, would join the UN forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting. The MASH units were routinely overwhelmed with patients due to shortages of transport, often receiving between 150 and 200 per day, although sometimes the number was high as 400. The units operated on men that were too critical to be transported. Those who could be moved or could not be treated in the MASH were taken by air or sea to US Army hospitals in Japan depending on the severity of their injuries. A US M4 Sherman tank being loaded into a boat at a California port, for movement to Pusan, 1950. Sustenance for the UN troops in Korea was among the other logistical challenges confronting the UN in the early days of the war. There were no C rations in Korea and only a small reserve in Japan at the outbreak of the war. The Quartermaster General of the United States Army immediately began moving all available C rations and 5-in-1 B rations from the United States to the Far East. Field rations at first were largely the less nutritious and palatable World War II K rations. The UN had to rely on much of the US stock of World War II-era material for much of this phase of the war. Provisioning of the ROK troops was an equally important and difficult problem. The regular issue ration to ROK troops was rice or barley and fish. It consisted of about of rice or barley, one half pound of biscuit, and one half pound of canned fish with spices. Often the cooked rice, made into balls and wrapped in cabbage leaves, was sour when it reached the combat troops on the line, and frequently it did not arrive at all. Occasionally, local purchase of foods on a basis of 200 Won (US$0.05) per day per man supplemented the issued ration. An improved ROK ration consisting of three menus, one for each daily meal, was ready in September 1950. It provided 3,210 calories, weighed , and consisted of rice starch, biscuits, rice cake, peas, kelp, fish, chewing gum, and condiments, and was packed in a waterproofed bag. With slight changes, this ration was found acceptable to the ROK troops and quickly put into production. It became the standard ration for them during the first year of the war. = Air resupply = An emergency airlift of critically needed items began almost immediately from the United States to the Far East. The Military Air Transport Service (MATS), Pacific Division, expanded rapidly after the outbreak of the war. The Pacific airlift was further expanded by the charter of civil airlines planes. The Canadian Government lent the United Nations a Royal Canadian Air Force squadron of six transports, while the Belgian Government added several DC-4s to the effort. Altogether, the fleet of about 60 four-engine transport planes operating across the Pacific before June 25, 1950, was quickly expanded to approximately 250. In addition to these, there were MATS C-74 Globemaster and C-97 Stratofreighter planes operating between the United States and Hawaii. The C-119 Flying Boxcar was a US aircraft used extensively to airlift supplies and men to the Pusan Perimeter. The Pacific airlift to Korea operated from the United States over three routes. These were commonly known as the \\"Great Circle\\" by pilots. One route left from McChord Air Force Base in Tacoma, Washington, and transited through Anchorage, Alaska, and Shemya in the Aleutians before finishing at Tokyo. This represented a distance of and a flying time of between 30 and 33 hours. A second route was the Mid-Pacific. This departed from Travis Air Force Base near San Francisco, California, and passed through Honolulu and Wake Island before arriving in Tokyo; the trip was and took 34 hours to complete. A third route was from California through Honolulu, and Johnston, Kwajalein, and Guam Islands to Tokyo: a distance of about and a flying time of 40 hours. The airlift moved about a day in July 1950. From Japan most of the air shipments to Korea were staged at Ashiya or at the nearby secondary airfields of Itazuke Air Base and Brady Air Base. The consumption of aviation gasoline during combat and resupply operations was so great in the early phase of the war, taxing the very limited supply available in the Far East, that it became one of the more serious logistical problems facing UN planners. Ocean tankers could rarely keep pace with the rate of consumption. Although the situation never forced the UN to halt its air operations, on several occasion the situation became quite dire, and was only rectified by the rapid procurement of supplies from Japan. On a number of occasions throughout the war, the demand of military consumption had the effect of leaving Japanese gas stations with no fuel to sell to the public. Fuel unloaded at Pusan. Gasoline shortages remained a serious logistical challenge for UN forces at Pusan. The airlift of critically needed items from the United States tapered off at the end of July as surface transportation began to meet requirements. Some items such as the new 3.5-inch rocket were still being carried largely by airlift, 900 of them being scheduled daily for air delivery to Korea during August. The new 5-inch \\"shaped charge\\" rockets for Navy fighter planes, developed at the Navy's Inyokern, California, Ordnance Test Station, were at first delivered to Korea entirely by air. On July 29, a special Air Force plane picked up the first 200 warheads from Inyokern for delivery to the Far East. After the first weeks of the war, steps were taken to reduce the necessity for the large number of airlifts to Korea from Japan. By July 15, Eighth Army was provided a daily ferry service from the Hakata-Moji area to Pusan, along with fast express trains from the Tokyo‚ÄìYokohama area. Accordingly, a Red Ball Express-type system was organized. It had a daily capacity of of items and supplies that were critically needed in Korea. The Red Ball made the run from Yokohama to Sasebo in a little more than 30 hours, and to Pusan in a total of about 53 hours. The first Red Ball Express train with high priority cargo left Yokohama at 1330 on July 23. Regular daily runs became effective two days later. The schedule called for the Red Ball to depart Yokohama at 2330 nightly and arrive at Sasebo at 0542 the next morning. From there, the cargo would be transferred directly from train to ship. Ship departure was scheduled for 1330 daily and arrival at Pusan at 0400 the next morning. The daily rail and water Red Ball Express from Yokohama to Sasebo to Pusan began on July 23. By August it was operating with increased efficiency, demonstrating that it could promptly deliver any supplies available in Japan to Korea. On August 5, for example, it delivered 308 tonnes; on August 9, 403 tonnes; on August 22, 574 tonnes; and on August 25, 949 tonnes. The success of the Red Ball Express cut down the amount of airlift tonnage. This fell from 85 tonnes on July 31 to 49 tonnes on August 6. The express eliminated the need for nearly all airlift of supplies to Korea from Japan. It delivered supplies to Korea in an average time of 60‚Äì70 hours, while the airlift delivery varied from 12 hours to 5 days. The Red Ball delivery was not only more cost effective, it was more consistent and reliable. The drop in air delivery to Korea caused Major General Earle E. Partridge, commanding the Far East Air Forces, to complain on August 10 that the Army was not fully using the airlift's 200 tonne daily capacity. That day, Eighth Army ordered curtailment of delivery by the Red Ball Express and increased use of the airlift to its maximum capacity. The reason given for this action was a sudden apprehension that the port of Pusan could not process the flow of water-borne supplies in a timely manner. The next day, upon Partridge's suggestion, two 2¬Ω-ton trucks were airlifted in a C-119 from Tachikawa Air Base in Japan to Taegu. The Air Force planned to airlift two trucks daily in this manner. As a result, on August 12, Eighth Army ordered the Red Ball Express be discontinued August 15 except on Tuesday and Friday of each week when it would carry cargo that was considered too difficult for the planes to handle. Under this arrangement airlift tonnage greatly increased. On August 16, transport planes carried 324 tonnes of cargo and 595 passengers; on August 19, 160 tonnes of cargo and 381 passengers; on 28 August, 398 tonnes of cargo and 343 passengers; and, on August 29, 326 tonnes of cargo and 347 passengers. = Sea resupply = US ships unload cargo at Pusan port, 1950. The majority of resupply by sea was conducted by cargo ships of the US Army and US Navy. The massive demand for ships forced the UN Command to charter private ships and bring ships out of the reserve fleet to augment the military vessels in service. The UN had a major advantage in its sealift operations in that the most developed port in Korea was Pusan which was at the southeastern tip of the peninsula. Pusan was the only port in South Korea that had dock facilities large enough to handle a sizable amount of cargo. Its four piers and intervening quays could berth 24 or more deepwater ships, and its beaches provided space for the unloading of 14 Landing Ship Tank (LST) vessels, giving the port a potential capacity of daily. Seldom, however, did the daily discharge of cargo exceed because of a lack of skilled labor, large cranes, rail cars, and trucks. A 60-ton crane for offloading supplies is towed to Pusan, 1950. The distance in nautical miles from the principal Japanese ports to Pusan varied depending on which Japanese port ships embarked from. It was from Fukuoka, from Moji, from Sasebo, from Kobe, and from Yokohama via the Bungo-Suido strait. The sea trip from the west coast of the United States to Pusan for personnel movement required about 16 days; the trip for heavy equipment and supplies on slower shipping schedules took longer. During the month of July 1950, a total of of supplies and equipment were off-loaded at Pusan, at a rate of about per day. The first heavy lift cranes arrived on July 23. A crane and two crawler cranes, towed from Yokohama. Not until the first week of August did a crane reach Pusan. In the last half of July, 230 ships arrived and 214 departed Pusan harbor. During this period, 42,581 troops, 9,454 vehicles, and of supplies came ashore there. Subordinate ports of Ulsan and Suyong unloaded ammunition and petroleum products over the beaches from barges, tankers, and LCMs. = Movement to the front lines = The main Seoul‚ÄìPusan railway and road was integral in bringing supplies to the front. From Pusan a good railroad system built by the Japanese and well ballasted with crushed rock and river gravel extended northward. Subordinate rail lines ran westward along the south coast through Masan and Chinju and northeast near the east coast to P'ohang-dong. There the eastern line turned inland through the east-central Taebaek Mountains area. The railroads were the backbone of the UN transportation system in Korea. The of Korean vehicular roads were all of a secondary nature as measured by American or European standards. Even the best of them were narrow, poorly drained, and surfaced only with gravel or rocks broken laboriously by hand, and worked into the dirt roadbed by the traffic passing over. The highest classification placed on any appreciable length of road in Korea by Eighth Army engineers was for a gravel or crushed rock road with gentle grades and curves and one and a half to two lanes wide. According to engineer specifications there were no two-lane roads, wide, in Korea. The average width of the best roads was with numerous bottlenecks at narrow bridges and bypasses where the width narrowed to . Often even on these roads there were short stretches having sharp curves and grades up to 15 percent. The Korean road traffic was predominately by oxcart. The road net, like the rail net, was principally north‚Äìsouth, with a few lateral east‚Äìwest connecting roads. Barbed wire is moved along the Seoul‚ÄìPusan railway to the front lines, 1950. US Army logistics units worked continuously during July to organize the train movements from Pusan toward the rail-heads at the front. By July 18 they had established a regular daily schedule of supply trains over two routes, the main Pusan‚ÄìTaegu‚ÄìKumch'on line with a branch line from Kumch'on to Hamch'ang; and the Pusan‚ÄìKyongju‚ÄìAndong single track line up the east coast with a branch line from Kyongju to P'ohang-dong. As the battle front moved swiftly southward, trains after the end of July did not run beyond Taegu and P'ohang-dong. After the North Korean threat developed in the Masan region, a supply train ran daily from Pusan to that city. On July 1 the UN Command controlled of rail track in South Korea. By August this had shrunk to of track. In July, 350 mixed trains moved from Pusan toward the front. These included 2,313 freight cars loaded with of supplies. Also leaving Pusan for the front were 71 personnel trains carrying military units and replacements. Among the trains returning to Pusan from the forward area were 38 hospital trains carrying 2,581 patients, and 158 freight cars loaded largely with personal belongings taken by unit commanders from their men in trying to strip them down to only combat needs. Since the Korean railroads had been built by Japan, repair and replacement items could be borrowed from the Japanese National Railways and airlifted to Korea within a very short time after the need for them became known. One of the largest and most important of rail purchases in Japan for use in Korea was 25 standard-gauge locomotives. By August 1 the ROK National Police was responsible for protecting all rail bridges and tunnels. Armed guards, their number varying with the importance of the structures, were stationed at each of them. Occasionally, guerrillas would attack trains in rear areas of the Pusan Perimeter, usually in the Yongch'on‚ÄìKyongju area in the east or along the lower Naktong in the Samnangjin area. These attacks generally resulted in small numbers of UN casualties and minor damage to rail equipment. The most successful guerrilla attack behind the lines of the Pusan Perimeter occurred on August 11 against a VHF radio relay station on Hill 915, south of Taegu. A guerrilla force, estimated at 100 men attacked at 05:15, drove off the ROK police and set fire to the buildings. American casualties were two killed, two wounded, and three missing. When a ROK police force reoccupied the area later in the day the guerrillas had pulled back. In August the UN also began using Korean civilians with A-frames as cargo carriers to move supplies up through the mountains to the front lines. This method of transport proved both cheaper and more efficient than using pack animals. American units obtained the civilian carriers through arrangements with the ROK Army. Soon the American divisions were using Korean labor for nearly all unskilled work, at an average of about 500 laborers and carriers to a division.  North Korean logistics  The responsibility of the North Korean logistics was divided between the Ministry of National Defense (MND), led by Marshal Choe Yong Gun, and the NKPA Rear Service Department, commanded by General Choe Hong Kup. The MND was mainly responsible for railroad transportation and supply procurement, while the Rear Service Department was responsible for road transportation. The North Koreans relied on a logistical system which was very lean and substantially smaller than the United Nations' system. This logistics network was therefore capable of moving far fewer supplies, and this caused considerable difficulty for front line troops. Based on the efficient Soviet model, this ground-based network relied primarily on railroads to transport supplies to the front lines while troops transported those items onto the individual units on foot, trucks, or carts. This second effort, though more versatile, was also a substantial disadvantage because it was less efficient and often too slow to follow the moving front-line units. = Challenges = US aircraft attack a North Korean train with rockets and napalm, 1950. In mid-July, the UN Far East Air Force (FEAF) Bomber Command began a steady and increasing attack on strategic North Korean logistics targets behind the front lines. The first of these targets was Wonsan on the east coast. Wonsan was important as a communications center that linked Vladivostok, Siberia with North Korea by rail and sea. From it, rail lines ran to all the North Korean build-up centers. The great bulk of Soviet supplies for North Korea in the early part of the war came in at Wonsan, and from the beginning it was considered a major military target. In the first heavy strategic bombing of the war, the FEAF hit the port city on July 13 with of demolition bombs. Three days later, 30 B-29 bombers struck the railroad marshaling yards at Seoul, another major staging area for North Korean supplies. UN bombers immediately targeted the pontoon bridge across the Han River at Seoul which was a main line of supply to the Pusan battlefield, and to destroy the repaired railroad bridge there. Several attempts in July by B-29s to destroy the rail bridge failed, but on July 29, 12 bombers succeeded in hitting the pontoon bridge and reported it as having been destroyed. The next day, 47 B-29s bombed the Chosen Nitrogen Plant at Hungnam on the northeast coast. In the meantime, carrier-based planes from the USS Valley Forge, which was operating in the Yellow Sea, destroyed six locomotives, exploded 18 cars of a 33-car train, and damaged a combination highway and rail bridge at Haeju on July 22. By July 27, the FEAF Bomber Command had a comprehensive rail interdiction plan ready. This plan sought to cut the flow of North Korean troops and materiel from North Korea to the combat area. Two cut points, the P'yong-yang railroad bridge and marshaling yards and the Hamhung bridge and Hamhung and Wonsan marshaling yards would almost completely sever North Korea's rail logistics network. Destruction of the rail bridges over the Han near Seoul would cut rail communication to the Pusan Perimeter area. On July 28 the Far East Air Forces gave a list of targets in the rail interdiction program to the Bomber Command, and two days later a similar plan was ready for interdiction of highways. On August 3, the FEAF issued lists of targets for coordinated interdiction attacks south of the 38th Parallel to the Fifth Air Force and to the Navy. In general, the Han River divided the Fifth Air Force and FEAF Bomber Command zones. A B-29 Superfortress during a Korean War bombing run. B-29s conducted the majority of air interdiction raids against North Korean supply lines. On August 4, the FEAF began B-29 interdiction attacks against all key bridges north of the 37th Parallel in Korea, and on August 15 some light bombers and fighter-bombers joined in the interdiction campaign. This campaign sought the destruction of 32 rail and highway bridges on the three main transportation routes across Korea: the line from Sinanju south to P'yongyang and northeast to Wonsan on the east coast; the line just below the 38th Parallel from Munsan-ni through Seoul to Ch'unch'on to Chumunjin-up on the east coast; and the line from Seoul south to Choch'iwon and east to Wonju to Samch'ok on the east coast. The interdiction campaign marked nine rail yards, including those at Seoul, P'yongyang, and Wonsan, for attack, and the ports of Inch'on and Wonsan to be mined. This interdiction program, if effectively executed, would slow and perhaps critically disrupt the movement of North Korean supplies along the main routes south to the battlefront. The US Air Force B-29s bombed and largely destroyed the P'yongyang Army Arsenal and the P'yongyang railroad yards on August 7. They bombed and completely destroyed the large Chosen petroleum refinery at Wonsan on August 7, 9, and 10. This plant, with its estimated capacity of , annually produced approximately 93 percent of the North Korean petroleum products. Throughout the month the US Air Force bombed the chemical complex in the Hungnam area, the largest in Asia, dropping of bombs there in the period between July 30 and September 19. It bombed the Najin docks only south of the Siberian border and from Vladivostok. Najin was an important port of entry for vessels carrying supplies from Vladivostok and it was also a rail center. The bombers struck the metal-working industry at Songjin with of bombs on August 28, and three days later they heavily damaged the aluminum and magnesium plants at Chinnamp'o with of bombs. = Land resupply = Wonsan under attack in 1951. Despite UN raids it remained one of North Korea's only ports that was developed enough for movement of small numbers of troops and amounts of logistics. North Korea's lack of large airstrips and aircraft meant it conducted only minimal air resupply, mostly critical items being imported from China. Other than this, however, aircraft played almost no role in North Korean logistics. The North Koreans were also not able to effectively use sea transport to their advantage. Ports in Wonsan and Hungnam could be used for the transport of some troops and supplies, but they remained far too underdeveloped to support any large-scale logistical movements, and the port of Inchon in the south was difficult to navigate with large numbers of ships. The interior of Korea also lacked navigable waterways, as the shallow streams and rivers did not provide for the movement of large ships. These rivers would only be of local importance to battles. The North Koreans tried on several occasions to resupply their units by sea or conduct amphibious operations at the outbreak of the war but each time were decisively defeated. At engagements such as the Battle of Pusan and the Battle of Chumonchin Chan the UN naval blockade was effective in halting almost all North Korean naval activity. This meant the railroads and highways in Korea took central prominence to North Korean resupply. The North Koreans were given supplies by both China and the Soviet Union, neither of whom were committed to the war at this point, and did not commit combat troops directly. They fed supplies into North Korea through six rail lines, five from Manchuria and one from Siberia. China in particular had an extensive rail network and thousands of locomotives. The railroads had the capacity to send up to of supplies into North Korea per day. The full amount of supplies that were actually sent to North Korea at this phase of the war is unclear, but historians suggest that even at the height of the war and Chinese involvement the supplies did not increase beyond per day. However the railroads were primarily oriented on north‚Äìsouth routes, making resupply from east to west difficult. North Korean logistics held much more substantial facilities for their railroad system, which were based in Seoul. However, they also did not have the benefit of buying replacement and repair parts from Japan, and consequently their railroads were in much worse condition than those held by the UN. They controlled the bulk of Korea's of railroad. They also controlled most of the 1,500 locomotives and 9,000 rail cars on the peninsula, though the majority of these were not serviceable during the fight. Seoul was also the focal point of Korea's highway network. It also had several crucial connection points to the Soviet Union and China, but it was not designed for military traffic and the weather conditions made travel on the roads difficult. Overall the roads into Korea provided only 48 percent of the capacity of the railroads. = Movement to the front lines = The supremacy of the Fifth Air Force in the skies over Korea forced the North Koreans in the first month of the war to resort to night movement of supplies to the battle area. They relied primarily on railroads to move supplies to the front, however a shortage of trucks posed the most serious problem of getting supplies from the trains to individual units, forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals. alt=A bomb explodes on a moving train. Since capturing Seoul, the North Koreans had built two pontoon bridges over the Han, one north and one south of the main rail and highway bridges. They had also started a new railroad bridge north of the old triple bridge group. The steel cantilever railroad bridge on the west still stood despite Far East Air Forces attempts to destroy it. For almost four weeks the Air Force bombed this bridge daily using bombs with fuze settings that were intended to damage both the superstructure and the abutments. On August 19, nine B-29s of the 19th Bombardment Group dropped of bombs on the bridge, but it still stood. The same day, Navy carrier-based planes attacked the bridge, scoring eight direct hits, and brought it down. Attacks against the Han River pontoon bridges at Seoul do not seem to have been successful until FEAF ordered the Bomber Command to lay delayed action bombs alongside the bridges on August 27, set to detonate at night. This method of attack seems to have caused such heavy casualties among the North Korean labor force trying to keep the pontoons in repair that they finally abandoned the effort. These bridges remained unfinished when the UN forces recaptured Seoul later in the year. The North Korean People's Army was able to maintain transport to its front lines over long lines of communications despite heavy and constant air attacks. The United Nations air effort failed to halt military rail transport. Ammunition and motor fuel, which took precedence over all other types of supply, continued to arrive at the front, though in smaller amounts than before. There was still a considerable resupply of heavy weapons, such as tanks, artillery, and mortars, at the front in early September, although a steady decline in artillery can be traced from the middle of August. There was a sufficient supply of small arms ammunition, but a shortage of small arms themselves became apparent by mid-August and continued to worsen with each passing week. Rear areas were able to fill only about one third of the requisitions from the front for small arms in mid-August and resupply ceased entirely about the middle of September. New trucks were almost impossible to obtain. There was no resupply of clothing. At best there were rations for only one or two meals a day. Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace, scavenging for food and supplies at night. By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the North Korean Army at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness. At the same time, seriously wounded North Korean soldiers were often not transported to the rear for medical services, and many died while stranded on the front line. The inefficiency of North Korean logistics remained a fatal weakness of the North Korean Army, costing it crucial defeats after an initial success with combat forces. The North Koreans' communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. Several units lost crucially needed supply lines in the middle of their offensives, particularly when crossing the Naktong River which had few stable bridges remaining. The NK 3rd Division stopped receiving food and ammunition supply as it pushed on Taegu in mid- August, forcing one of its regiments to withdraw from the captured Triangulation Hill. At Naktong Bulge, the NK 4th Division was able to establish a raft system for moving supplies across the river, but it still suffered serious food, ammunition, weapon, and equipment shortages after its August 5 crossing. It was also eventually turned back due to supply problems. The situation was most dire for units in the east, where rugged and mountainous terrain already posed a logistical challenge. The NK 5th Division and NK 12th Division attacking P'ohang-dong stopped receiving all food and ammunition supply between August 12 and August 20, a key factor in their defeat there. In some instances, desperate North Korean units forced South Korean populations to carry their supplies for them. North Korean units had advanced too far too quickly, and their logistical system, stretched beyond its limit, collapsed at a key point in the war. Morale remained high for many units despite the lack of supplies. North Korean units instead turned to foraging for what they could find in the countryside or raiding UN supplies. Small guerrilla units, such as the NK 766th Infantry Regiment, could do this effectively.  Conclusions  Historians contend that for the UN and North Korea, locked in a bitter battle where neither could gain the upper hand, logistics was among the most important determining factors in how the war would progress. As the disparity in logistics capability widened between the UN and North Korean forces, the well-supported UN troops were able to hold their positions along the Pusan Perimeter, while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as resupplies became increasingly unreliable. This trend ultimately culminated in the UN recapturing Seoul, the key logistics center of the battle, and the collapse of the North Korean logistics system with the entire NKPA. As the battle for Pusan Perimeter wore on, logistics took an increasingly important toll on the outcome of individual engagements. UN units faced the challenge of re-equipping the ROK Army and supporting a massive force of troops in a large-scale war that it had not anticipated or planned for. Still, historians have praised US Army logistics planners for the way that they were able to organize a working logistics system for the UN forces in the battle. Upon the outbreak of the war, the United States had an overwhelming advantage in materiel which had been left behind from World War II, and it relied on this to supply units in the first crucial days while new materiel was produced and shipped into the theater. Air superiority was another critical advantage in the favor of the UN. A number of UN contributing nations provided large air forces so that materiel could be transported quickly. At the same time, US Army planners established Pusan port as the main port for supply delivery. The UN also had a great advantage in the port of Pusan itself as it was the most developed port in Korea and as a consequence had the capacity for large numbers of ships to offload supplies. With a large transcontinental navy and strong economic base in Japan, the UN forces were able to utilize the port effectively. These advantages ensured that UN forces had mostly stable lines of supply for the entirety of the battle. North Korean troops had the advantage of planning the invasion in advance and organizing a pre-set logistics network, but they were not able to keep this logistics network running efficiently. Their largest disadvantage was the successful large-scale UN interdiction effort, as North Korean supplies and supply lines were subjected to UN bombing raids. This effort was not successful in stopping the North Korean supplies, and the North Koreans have also been praised by historians for the way in which they were able to maintain a supply network in the face of a massive bombing campaign. However, the North Koreans did suffer reduced supply because of this, and inefficiencies in transporting supplies from railroads to individual units negated the railroads' advantage. North Korean forces, though initially successful, were unable to counter UN forces with effective air defense, and were also unable to conduct successful interdiction of their own. This meant their supply network limited the combat actions that they could undertake; logistics could not keep up with units on the offensive, and North Korean units went almost completely unsupported during key engagements, reducing their ability to fight effectively. North Korean logistical inefficiency prevented them from overwhelming UN units in the Pusan Perimeter and enabled the defending UN troops to hold on long enough for a counterattack to be launched at Inchon. This landing, coming behind North Korean lines, had the effect of collapsing the North Korean front and ultimately ended the battle around Pusan in September.

It is the fourth of five instrumental sonatas comprising his opus 11. This sonata and the following Op. 11 No. 5 for solo viola mark Hindemith's decision to abandon playing the violin in favor of its larger cousin. A typical performance lasts between 15 and 18 minutes. Movements The sonata is in three movements, which are played without a break: #Fantasie #Thema mit Variationen #Finale (mit Variationen) =Fantasie= Ruhig ‚Äì Sehr Breit ‚Äì Im Zeitma√ü ‚Äì Breit At about three minutes in length, this is the shortest of the movements, and also the freest in form and harmonic exploration, passing through roughly ten keys in the space of 41 measures. The viola introduces the main theme of the sonata in the key of F, over hushed piano accompaniment; the piano soon picks up this melody and the two instruments begin to develop a rhythmic figure that serves as a sort of coda to the theme. The piano then falls back to a subsidiary role with shimmering thirty-second note accompaniment, while the theme builds in the viola to a powerful, C-major cadenza. The music picks up again quietly in E minor on the piano, as the viola plays a decorative rhythmic figure. The theme returns quickly and is passed between the instruments in a show of virtuosity for the soloist. After a final, powerful statement, the music comes to rest in D; the piano attempts to stray to the minor mode with G-minor chords and F-naturals, but the viola insists on rising to an F-sharp. Alone now, the viola rises by whole steps to A-sharp, which is sustained enharmonically to B-flat as the beginning of the next movement. =Thema mit Variationen= Ruhig und einfach, wie ein Volkslied *Var. I Dasselbe Zeitma√ü *Var. II ein wenig kaprizi√∂s *Var. III Lebhafter und sehr flie√üend *Var. IV noch lebhafter The theme of the second movement is, as the marking suggests, a simple, folkish tune introduced in e-flat minor by the viola. The theme is notable for bearing a time signature of both 2/4 and 3/4; Hindemith finds this a convenient solution for notating phrases of different lengths without resorting to abolishing bar lines or notating time signature changes nearly every bar. Variation III and the third movement also make extensive use of this technique. The variations proceed as follows: Variation I is in 6/8 time, with the melody, now in E-Flat minor reduced to notes of equal length, played in a contrapuntal overlap by the piano and viola. Variation II returns to 2/4, and is a spry, rhythmic rendition of the theme in the viola over an accompaniment of staccato thirds and sixths. Variation III is lyrical and sweeping, in the key of E-Flat. Long lines in the viola contrast a moto perpetuo accompaniment of sixteenth and thirty-second notes in the piano. Variation IV reaches a climax, with an ostinato accompaniment providing the grounding for the off-kilter rhythmic setting of the theme. Hindemith introduces a non-traditional key signature (G-sharp and F-Sharp only) that sets the music in a whole-tone mode; while the viola does occasionally play runs and phrases with half-steps, the piano persists in the figure G#-F#-E-D, over which the viola builds towards a climax in C-sharp minor, which is the first note of the third movement. =Finale (mit Variationen)= *Sehr lebhaft ‚Äì Breit ‚Äì Leicht flie√üend *Var.

VII Coda *Wild ‚Äì Noch mehr treiben ‚Äì Breiter This movement is the apotheosis of Hindemith's mastery of classical forms. It functions both as an unusual set of variations, as its name suggests, and as a full-fledged Sonata-Allegro movement. As indicated by the continuation of variations numbers from the previous movement, the theme being varied is the one from that movement, which functions as the second theme in Sonata-Allegro terminology. The first theme, introduced immediately at the beginning of the movement, is the very distinctive figure of a turn followed by an ascending scale. This figure is played and elaborated on by the soloist, with the pianist providing tonicizing changes of harmony at each instance of the turn figure. The viola then transforms this figure into the beginning of a more lyrical theme, which brings the music down in tempo and dynamic level. The main theme returns momentarily, only to falter and give way to a new quiet theme which is a continuance of the rhythmic developments made by the first softer section. This theme, quick downward steps followed by a gentle Mannheim rocket and another set of descending steps, may easily be mistaken for a second theme, when in fact it is an extension and transformation of the movement's opening gesture. The music comes completely to rest before the viola re-introduces the second movement theme in Variation 5. After a simple statement of the theme, the piano and viola engage in call-and-response on a theme derived from the rhythm of the second movement's first variation. After some varied tonal wanderings, there is a strong buildup of dominant- preparation for A-flat major, in which key the piano restates the folk song theme while the viola plays the rhythmic coda-variant as a sort of counter- subject, creating a brilliant and beautiful synthesis. This leads into a headlong acceleration, with running eighth notes in the piano set against off- beat tied notes in the viola. The soloist recaps the second movement theme in its original form, albeit at a breakneck speed, and this leads back into the opening theme of the movement, now in E major. This security quickly dies away in harmonic ambiguity, leaving two beats of non-tonic silence in which to begin the next variation. The fugal treatment of the theme in Variation VI fastidiously avoids functional tonal harmony that the ear can follow. The contour of the melody is made to outline a diminished triad rather than the accustomed major triad, and the accompaniment consists of clunking, harmonically unrelated dominant seventh chords missing their fifth degrees, very much lending the music to the composer's direction of 'bizarre and clumsy'. By the pianist's entrance, the viola has taken the coda figure, much in the same form as in previous sections, and transformed it into the fugue's counter-subject. The texture remains thin throughout, but the music increases in volume as the pianist adds octaves to both hands and the violist contributes two- and three-note pizzicati, giving strong but unexpected tonicization for E-Flat minor, in which key occurs the sonata's recapitulation. This section is a transposed and compressed repetition of the opening, which skips the development of the first theme into the impostor second theme, jumping straight into the latter. This section is also repeated almost note-for-note. The viola falls silent when the piano re-introduces the second-movement theme, entering in what was previously the accompaniment's role of playing the coda-figure. Where before the instruments traded this figure back and forth, now the viola retains it exclusively as the piano builds to an identical climax and plays the second movement theme, accompanied as before by the coda-figure in the viola. The instruments again accelerate into a statement of the second-movement theme in the viola, and into a seemingly-familiar arrival at the third-movement theme. Now, however, the piano abandons solid tonic triads in favor of a more leading dominant seventh chord, and both instruments rush upward to a climax followed by a downward harmonic minor scale in unison, which transforms into the ostinato from the end of the second movement, seemingly leading to a similar, crashing climax. After the pounding whole-tone ostinato of the previous measures, the hushed repetition of the second movement theme in E-Flat Minor is supremely unexpected. The piano plays off-beat chords, then a counter-melody whose harmonies move in quick circle-of-fifths and enharmonic progression. After a few small experiments with rhythmic displacement of the theme, the viola begins a figure of ascending triplets while the piano recapitulates exactly (albeit in a different key and with textural changes) the climax of the Theme section of Movement II. At the marking 'Wild', the piano takes up the triplet figure and the viola plays off-beat eight notes, which seem to gradually transform into dotted eighths followed by a sixteenth, then into a single eight followed by two sixteenths, while the piano now comes into a broad statement of the second movement theme in E-Flat Minor. The final bars make use of this theme in a variety of rhythms, eventually distilling it down to one, powerful phrase. The piano emphasizes E-Flat Major but the flat sixth of the theme pulls towards minor, and its final statement, in unison between the viola and triple double octaves in the piano, is modally ambiguous, though unquestionably triumphant.

He took part in the conquest of Byzantine lands, and was given a region north of Thessaly to govern in the early 1350s. Origin It is believed that Radoslav Hlapen is the same person as ≈æupan (count) Hlapen () who governed Konavle and the wider Trebinje region in the 1330s. He was possibly the son of ≈æupan Radoslav, and thus named Radoslav after his father. Another theory is that he was the son of Syrgiannes Palaiologos. Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos (r. 1347‚Äì54) mentioned him as among the most important nobles, and he was called a relative of Du≈°an. Service under Stefan Du≈°an Serres was captured in September 1345, Veria in the first half of 1346. Veria and the surrounding towns were recuperated by John VI Kantakuzenos. After the military conquests, perhaps by spring 1351, Hlapen returned the city to Serbian rule, with many cities and towns in the area. He was appointed governor of Edessa (Voden) and Veria (Ber), just north of Thessaly. Emperor Du≈°an died in Devol, on 20 December 1355. Du≈°an was succeeded by his son Stefan Uro≈° V. Service under Stefan Uro≈° V After the death of the governor of Thessaly kesar Preljub (1356), Preljub's son Thomas' claim to the region was asserted by the widow Irene. The Preljuboviƒá family was forced to flee to Serbia after the advance of Nikephoros II Orsini in 1356. Irene married Radoslav Hlapen, who adopted Thomas. Despot Simeon Uro≈°, the brother of Du≈°an, was appointed governor of Epirus and Acarnania in 1348. Following the death of Du≈°an and subsequent invasion of Nikephoros II, Simeon Uro≈° retreated to Kastoria, where he proclaimed himself \\"Emperor of Serbs, Greeks and Albanians\\". Simeon Uro≈° acquired the support of John Komnenos Asen (the brother-in-law of Du≈°an). In response, the Serbian nobility held a council in April 1357 at Skopje, in which they vowed to support Emperor Uro≈°, according to Du≈°an's will. In the summer of 1358, Simeon Uro≈° advanced on Zeta but was stopped at Skadar, where his army of 5,000 men was defeated by the Serbian nobility. Simeon Uro≈° returned to Kastoria, and never again tried to acquire Serbia. During the absence of Simeon Uro≈° in Epirus (1359), Hlapen invaded Thessaly on behalf of his stepson Thomas. Simeon Uro≈° was forced to cut his losses by recognizing Radoslav Hlapen's conquests, turning over Kastoria to him, and marrying his daughter Maria to Thomas. Hlapen continued to recognize Uro≈°' suzerainty, and provided a buffer between Uro≈° V and Simeon Uro≈°. After the treaty between Hlapen and Simeon Uro≈°, the latter settled in Thessaly.

Bolton and arrange to install in the State House. Sarah T. Bolton was known as the \\"Pioneer Poet Laureate of Indiana.\\" Her poems are published in Poems (1865), Life and Poems of Sarah Tittle Bolton (1880), and Songs of a Lifetime (1892). Her most well known poem is ‚ÄúPaddle Your Own Canoe.‚Äù Emma Sangernebo, n√©e Elyes (1877‚Äì1969), was a well-known local artist trained at Herron Art School, Indianapolis. She was both a sculptor and painter. A member of the National League of American Pen Women, she was awarded the commission. Sangernebo based the sculpture on a photograph of Bolton that appeared in Bolton's Life and Poems of Sarah Tittle Bolton (1880). She completed the sculpture in Chicago where it was also cast. The sculpture was installed on October 18, 1941 in the northeast niche on the second floor of the State House rotunda where it remains today. At the dedication ceremony, Bolton Mann, the great-great-grandson of Sarah T. Bolton, unveiled the relief sculpture. Walter Flandorf (1893‚Äì1949), husband of Vera Sangernebo (1902‚Äì2001), daughter of Emma and Alexander Sangernebo, put Bolton's \\"Paddle Your Own Canoe\\" to music.

It is entirely double track and is served by line S1 of the Hamburg S-Bahn along its entire length. It leaves the extension of the Hamburg-Altona link line at Ohlsdorf station and runs to Poppenb√ºttel. The original plans envisaged an extension to Wohldorf or Volksdorf. History  Kornweg station Shortly after the turn of the century, several villages in the area around Hamburg, including enclaves of the city sought a connection to the city‚Äôs railway network. Apart from the Alster Valley line, this effort led to the construction of the Forest Villages line (Waldd√∂rferbahn), starting in 1912. This line later became part of the Hamburg U-Bahn and is now mostly served by line U1. Just one year after the signing of the Ohlsdorf Treaty, which was the basis for the Hamburg-Altona City and Suburban Railway‚Äîthe precursor of the S-Bahn‚Äîon 12 December 1905, a community group formed to promote the extension of the suburban railway through Ohlsdorf to the Alster Valley and beyond. The Havestadt & Contag Company of Berlin was engaged to plan the building of the line. It was planned that they would be built as follows: the line would run from Ohlsdorf on the Hamburg-Altona link line to Poppenb√ºttel, where the line would divide. An eastern branch would run to Volksdorf and a western branch to Wohldorf. Trains would serve the two branches equally. The Alster Valley Company (Alstertal Bahn GmbH), which had been founded on 4 May 1908 to operate the route, negotiated with the Prussian government and the city of Hamburg. Under the compromise negotiated, it was agreed that the line would only initially run only to Poppenb√ºttel, as the following villages to be served were exclaves of Hamburg and thus needed an additional special license. The initial section was planned to be double track and electrified throughout from the beginning. The license for the less than six-kilometre section between Ohlsdorf and Poppenb√ºttel was issued on 3 December 1912 by Hamburg and on 31 May 1913 by Prussia. It was intended that the line would go into operation three years later. Meanwhile, Alstertalbahn GmbH was converted into a joint-stock company and operated under the name of Alstertalbahn-Aktien-Gesellschaft (ABAG). The main shareholder in the company in 1912 was the entrepreneur Johann von Wentzel, a developer of the valley. =Construction and operation = A Berlin-based company, Julius Berger AG was commissioned in 1913 to carry out the works. However, since the First World War began a year later, work was quickly brought to a halt by material and labour shortages. ABAG also had difficulties in selling its land and thus got into financial difficulties. The planned start-up date thus could not be met. Reception hall of Ohlsdorf station, the starting point of the line Class 474 EMU in Poppenb√ºttel station at the end of the line Under the difficult conditions the line‚Äîoriginally single track‚Äîwas completed and authorised to operate by the state police. Temporary operations began on 15 January 1918, but operated with petrol-powered railcars, rather than electric railcars. Not enough copper was available for overhead wires. The remaining work was completed on 10 July 1920, six months after the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles. By this time ABAG had runs out of funds and its main shareholder liquidated it on 10 November 1920. In 1922, the Stormarn district, in which the villages were located, took over ABAG‚Äôs shares and continued construction of the line. Electric operations were fully commissioned on 24 March 1924. On 22 April 1940, the electrical system was partially converted. In addition to the existing system of electrification with 6.3 kV at 25 Hz alternating current, a third rail was installed at the side of the track with 1.2 kV direct current. Parallel electrical operations continued until 1955, when the overhead line was removed. The Alster Valley Railway was therefore the first line of the Hamburg S-Bahn to operate on its current electrical system.

Built during the Quaternary period, it is composed of basaltic andesite. It stands in height and has a diameter of . Under the volcano lies Crater Bench, the result of an eruption of basaltic andesite. To the east of the volcano are a series of hot springs, known as Crater, Baker Hot Springs, or Abraham hot springs. Background Fumarole Butte is located in the area once dominated by Lake Bonneville, a massive body of water nearly in area. The lake was created more than 800,000 years ago by extensive precipitation and glacier melting, and has dried up and re-emerged at least 28 times since. The cycles have been matched almost exactly to periods of glaciation by drilling and stratigraphic studies. Description Satellite photograph of Fumarole Butte, November 2010 Fumarole Butte lies north of the Sevier Desert. It is located in the scoria-rich valley of a basaltic lava field, on top of Tertiary-aged structures of rhyolitic lava. Made of red and gray material, its composition ranges from dark basalt to reddish scoria. Fumarole Butte formed during the Jaramillo normal event, approximately one million years ago. It is a shield volcano with a volcanic neck protruding from the center. On the edges of the volcano, lacustrine deposits can be found where the volcano was once covered by Lake Bonneville. Crater Bench Eruptions from Fumarole Butte created the basaltic Crater Bench formation, which lies beneath the neck. It is around 900,000 years of age, dated to the Pleistocene. The area is divided by faults and ranges in thickness from to . The primary component of the lava is aphyric basaltic andesite in which tiny crystalline structures are visible.

It was written by co-executive producer Ron Weiner and directed by Michael Engler. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on November 11, 2010. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) finds a pair of jeans that make her look sexy, but which leave her with an unexpected moral dilemma; Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) attempts to stop Regina Bookman being elected by endorsing her political rival Steven Austin (special guest star John Slattery); and a jealous Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) attempts to sabotage the chances of the new Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) film winning a Golden Globe Award. Plot While shopping at a store called \\"Brooklyn Without Limits\\" with Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) miraculously finds a pair of jeans that make her look sexy and win her new respect at work, but she is informed by Jack that the seemingly artsy and liberal store is, in fact, owned by Halliburton, and the jeans are made by a \\"Vietnamese slave tribe\\" on an \\"island prison\\" called Usa (pronounced \\"oosa\\"). Liz becomes conflicted over whether to keep the jeans and her new image, or stand up for what she believes in. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), in an attempt to keep Regina Bookman from being reelected, decides to endorse her rival, a Rhode Island independent candidate named Steven Austin (special guest star John Slattery). It soon becomes clear that Austin is mentally unstable, as he plans to return to the \\"Founding Father's America\\" which he envisions as \\"no paved roads, rum used as an anesthetic, [and] legal slavery.\\", and to build a casino on the moon. Despite this, Jack holds a fundraiser for him and edits a pre-recorded speech of Austin's to make him seem sane. At the same time, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) has discovered that he is being considered for a Golden Globe, and that members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association will be evaluating his film. Taking advantage of his inexperience, Jenna attempts to sabotage him by convincing him to hold a private screening of the film and attempt to bribe them, not revealing that she had attempted doing the same, only to be banned for life from the Golden Globes. In the end, all three decide to do the right thing. At the screening of Hard to Watch, all in the audience, including Jenna, are moved to tears. At the last minute, Jenna tells Tracy to not bribe the critics, telling him that the film is good enough to win a Golden Globe on its own. Seeing this, Liz is convinced to return the jeans. She does, and returns to work in a ridiculously unflattering pair of \\"Shorteralls\\". Jack sees her and decides to let Bookman win rather than let an insane man into Congress. He convinces Austin to make a live speech, where he destroys all of the support Jack generated. Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 5.09 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 2.4 rating/7 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.4 percent of all 18- to 49-year- olds, and 7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a B score and complimented the fifth season of 30 Rock for demonstrating an improvement in quality over the fourth, but accused \\"Brooklyn Without Limits\\" of being \\"a step in the wrong direction\\". He mostly criticized the political overtones, commenting \\"this is a funny show, but it's not an especially politically astute one, and it tends to stick its foot in a bucket and clank around for half an hour when it turns to politically oriented storylines.\\" However he concluded that \\"there was enough in the way of killer one-liners in this episode to keep it from sinking; this same episode, last season, would likely have been a disaster\\". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also spoke favourably about the quality of the fifth season, opining that \\"with a few exceptions, this young season is shaping up to be the show's best since year two\\". He particularly praised guest star John Slattery, commenting \\"everything about the Steve Austin character was just glorious in its absurdity.

One of the oldest traditions at Washington & Jefferson College were the \\"Freshman Rules\\", a system of rules and restrictions on freshmen. Failure by freshmen to follow these rules would subject them to beatings by upperclassmen or other punishments doled out by the \\"Freshman Court\\". During the 1870s and 1880s, the students engaged in organized athletic competitions, pitting the freshman versus sophomore classes in the \\"Olympic Games\\" that involved elaborate opening ceremonies and the smoking of a Pipe of Peace.\\" Another form of physical contest between the freshman and sophomore classes were the annual \\"color rush,\\" where the teams fought over control over strips of fabric, the \\"pole rush,\\" where the teams battled to raise a flag up a flagpole, and the \\"cane rush\\" where the teams fought over control over a ceremonial cane. These contests generally devolved into outright gang violence. The college cheer, \\"Whichi Coax\\", is so pervasive in college history and culture that in addition to being shouted during academic ceremonies and football games, it is also used as a salutation in correspondence between alumni. The college's fight song, \\"Good Ole W&J;\\", is sung to the tune of \\"99 Bottles of Beer\\" and makes fun of a number of rival colleges, including the University of Pittsburgh and the Washington Female Seminary. For a large portion of the college's history, there was no official alma mater, but there were a number of other tradition hymns and songs. Songs and chants =Whichi Coax= The traditional college cheer, Whichi Coax, is based on the sound that frogs make in Aristophanes' Ancient Greek comedy, The Frogs. While the date of its origins are unknown, the cheer first appears in the 1892 yearbook. The cheer is similar to Yale University's college cheer, \\"Brick-ke-kex Coax\\", which is also based on The Frogs and appeared around the same time. Because of its tradition and connection to the college's history, President Tori Haring-Smith called it a \\"secret handshake among friends.\\" The college yell is used during Honors Convocation ceremonies, Matriculation ceremonies, beginning-of-the-year Convocation ceremonies, campus re-dedications, and as closing salutations in letters among alumni. It also is to be yelled after the singing of the Alma Mater. =\\"Alma Mater of Washington & Jefferson College\\" and other songs= Sheet music for the \\"Alma Mater of Washington & Jefferson College\\" The \\"Alma Mater of Washington & Jefferson College\\", lyrics by L. D. Hemingway, class of 1902, and set to an 1857 tune (\\"Annie Lisle\\") used by many colleges, was first printed in the 1902 book Songs of Washington & Jefferson College. However, the song was not listed in any commencement program until 1908. However, the exact date of its adoption as the official alma mater is not clear: the July 1908 edition of College Bulletin, an alumni publication, stated that the college had no recognized Alma Mater song, but expressed hope that this \\"defect would be remedied.\\" Oddly, 1908 was also the first year that the song appeared in any Commencement ceremony. The alma mater is to be followed by a round of \\"Whichi Coax\\". The \\"Washington & Jefferson College Hymn\\", a different song from the alma mater, was composed by Julian G. Hearne, class of 1926. In 2006, the W&J; Magazine reported on the existence of several other lost songs, including \\"My Term Report\\", \\"The Red and The Black\\", \\"M‚ÄôMillan‚Äôs March\\", \\"Alumni Song\\", \\"The College Anthem\\", and \\"Red and Black.\\" =\\"Good Ole W&J;\\"= The college's fight song, \\"Good Ole W&J;\\", was first sung in the 1920s. The song is to the tune of \\"99 Bottles of Beer.\\" The lyrics of \\"And the Sem will surely fail\\" is a reference to the neighboring Washington Female Seminary, which ceased operations in 1948. After a peak in popularity during the 1940s, the tradition was lost during the 1960s. The song was re-introduced to the student body during a matriculation ceremony in August 2005, after newly installed president Tori Haring-Smith was sung the song over the phone by an alumnus from the 1940s. The rebirth of the song did come with one change: the addition of \\"and daughters\\" to the line \\"Wash-Jeff's been run by loyal sons/For generations back,\\" in recognition of the fact that the college has been co- educational for 35 years. Olympic Games and Field Days The classes of 1877 and 1876 began the tradition of holding annual \\"Olympic Games,\\" where the freshman and sophomore classes would compete in various athletic events at the Old Fairgrounds. The opening ceremonies included partisan bands and the smoking of a \\"Pipe of Peace.\\" During the 1881 Olympic Games, the competitions included the rope pull, the 100 yard dash, hop skip and jump, potato sack races, throwing of a base ball, 220 yard race, high jump, hurdle race, long jump, Indian wrestling, three legged race, 2 mile race, \\"scratch\\", and football. Traditionally, the competitors employed \\"ruses\\" to influence the officiating. These games eventually fell out of favor, as only 15 students from each class would participate. Instead, the student body preferred the \\"Field Days\\" tradition, a campus-wide student athletic campus-wide athletic festival run entirely by students, where all could participate. Color rush, pole rush, cane rush, and pushball  The 1911 color rush contestA game of pushball During the late 19th and early 20th century, several forms of annual physical contests developed that pitted the freshmen classes against the sophomore class. In the 1890s and 1900s, the freshmen class and the sophomore class engaged in an annual \\"color rush\\" battle, where members of the freshmen class had strips of fabric sewn into their jackets after Monday chapel service and were led into the lawn between Old Main and Thompson Library. Members of the sophomore class would attack, attempting to take as many of the fabric strips as possible. These battles often left bruised bodies and hard feelings, as combatants often lost whole articles of clothing amid the \\"scrap\\". A similar event, the \\"pole rush,\\" was founded in 1894 by the Class of 1897. In the pole rush, the freshman class raise their flag on a flagpole on campus and the sophomores would attempt to bring it down. Traditionally, the combatants would resort to dirty tricks to win, including dousing the opposing team with a \\"shower of ancient eggs and flour.\\" By 1908, the rules were changed to prevent injuries, which had become commonplace. During the 1880s, the \\"cane rush\\" was traditionally a physically violent contest, where a member of the freshman class would taunt a sophomore with a cane, daring him to take it away from him. Next, 10 freshmen would place their hands on the cane, with a number of their classmates surrounding them, while the sophomores would run at the group, seeking to take the cane. After 12 minutes of bloody fighting, whichever class had the most hands on the cane would be the winner. The cane rush was seen as a rite of passage for freshmen. The rules of play changed over time; at times the cane was hidden on campus, with the object of the game to find the cane before the other class. The rushes, which had devolved from an annual rite of passage into serious physical violence, were banned by the faculty in 1913. The campus' focus then turned to the game of pushball, which was founded in 1910. In this contest, two teams of 5 or 6 freshmen and sophomores battled each other over control of a 6-foot rubber ball. The objective of the game was to push the ball past the opposing team into a goal area, resulting in 2 points. To break a tie, 1 point was awarded for the team that had the ball in the opposition's goal area at the end of regulation. The popularity of this game waned and grew several times through the 1940s and 1950s. Freshman traditions The Freshman Rules from 1944 One of the oldest traditions at Washington & Jefferson College were the \\"Freshman Rules,\\" a system of rules and restrictions on freshmen. By tradition, the rules were to \\"make the frosh feel at home.\\" Of all the rules, the sock inspection inspired the most fear, as upperclassmen were able to inspect the color and type of socks worn by any freshman at any time. Punishments for failing to wear Freshman Rules-compliant socks ranged from paddling to being drenched in the gym showers. The sock inspections often turned into a gang fight, with freshman defending their compatriot against upperclassmen. In 1922, upperclassmen founded the \\"Freshman Court\\" was to enforce these rules. The court grew into a powerful campus organization, sponsoring contests and events for freshmen, in addition to dispensing punishment for violating the Freshman Rules. The rules changed frequently from year to year, but they generally required all freshmen to wear \\"dinks\\" and ties while on campus, as well as prescribed sock styles. Other rules included \\"Freshmen must not walk on the grass of the campus\\", \\"Freshmen are required to learn all College songs and cheers\\", \\"Freshmen shall not wear preparatory or high school colors, rings, or insignia\\", and \\"Freshmen should speak at all times when passing another person on campus\\". Most minor infractions resulted in a paddling or having their mouths washed out with soap; other punishments were ironic: freshmen found smoking on campus were punished by having to wear a Chesterfield sign, freshmen who missed a football game were forced to wear a large football schedule around their neck, and freshmen who forgot their handbook during chapel service were sentenced to wear a toilet seat around their neck. Records show that one freshman, whose offense was not recorded, was forced to wear toast over his ears and carry a sign reading \\"I am a ham sandwich.\\" Members of Lex Ultimo at the beginning of the 1959 acadmemic year By the 1930s, the year's freshman rules began to be lifted by the beginning of Christmas break. The \\"Vigilante Committee\\" was founded in 1941, serving as a grand jury for the Freshman Court. During the 1940s, the Freshman Rules fell out of favor as returning World War II veterans refused to participate. The rules were reinstated in the 1950s, once those students had graduated. In 1956, the Student Council created \\"Lex Ultimo,\\" a new organization to write and enforce the Freshman rules alongside the Freshman Court. The 28 members of Lex Ultimo included 14 members of the Student Council and the 14 Freshman Court Judges, all of whom wore a uniform of red hats with a white shield and a gavel and paddle. Lex Ultimo drafted the year's rules at the first meeting of the year, known as the \\"blood meeting.\\" The organization was also responsible for freshman of freshman orientation, pep rallies, freshman cheering sections, and the annual pushball contests. The popularity of the freshman rules waned in the late 1950s and early 1960s, as the Freshman Court met only once per year and punished only the most egregious offenders. The Freshman Court ceased to function altogether in 1959. In 1960, the Student Council passed a resolution to end the tradition, but they continued. In 1962 the Student Council held hearings on ways to reform the rules, limiting their scope to requiring name badges and dinks, while adding summer reading lists and a campus-wide \\"big brother-little brother\\" mentorship system. Academic ceremonies The college holds several formal academic ceremonies each year. One of the oldest is the baccalaureate ceremony, which is held in conjunction with the graduation exercises. The first baccalaureate ceremonies were held in 1859 by Washington College and 1865 by Jefferson College. Early graduation ceremonies were week- long affairs, with large meals, college dances, and debates held by the literary societies. The tradition of recognizing 50-year graduates as members of the \\"Old Guard\\" began in 1930, and became organized as an official alumni group in the 1950s. The procession of seniors to the graduation site is led by the longest-tenured faculty member, who carries a ceremonial mace cared from the original wooden column of McMillan Hall. The tradition of the \\"Spoon of Knowledge\\", a large wooden spoon passed each year by the graduating senior class to the junior class to symbolize the \\"spooning\\" of knowledge to the younger class, dates to 1865. The spoon is covered with silver disks bearing the name of the each graduating class. The tradition was placed on hiatus in 1968 and revived in 1993 with the carving of a new spoon. Founder's Day, first held in 1903, was an event for freshmen commemorating college founders John McMillan, Thaddeus Dod, Joseph Smith. The tradition went on hiatus during the 1970s and was finally retired in 2005. As a replacement ceremony, Convocation, held at the beginning of the school year, is open to all members of the college community. To commemorate the first Convocation in 2005, the bell in Old Main was refurbished and rang for the first time in decades. At Matriculation, freshmen are officially welcomed to the college community in a ceremony where they sign the college's mission statement, receive their official college pin, and learn the college songs and yells.

Leporinus fasciatus is tropical freshwater species, native to the rivers and flooded forests of South America. Its range encompasses the Amazon Basin. L. fasciatus has also been recorded in the US states of Florida and Hawaii, probably introduced accidentally as a result of aquarium releases. However, it has not been reported from Hawaii for several years; therefore the Hawaii population is thought to have been extirpated. It is generally found in fast-flowing waters. L. fasciatus plays a minor role in fisheries. Its main importance to humans is in the aquarium trade. L. fasciatus may jump if startled, necessitating aquariums with strong tops.

He was a member and speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories. He was born at Markham Township in 1828, the son of a wagon maker and merchant. After attending school, he joined his family business, remaining there until purchasing and starting businesses of his own: a carriage making company and later a planing mill where he made a variety of items, along with his brother. Eakin later sold his plant and moved west to homestead and farm near Crescent Lake. Here he involved himself in local affairs, eventually winning election to the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories for the district of Saltcoats, serving from 1894 to 1902. His term involved negotiations with the Government of Canada for provincial status for the Northwest Territories. For the latter three years of his term, he was selected to serve as speaker of the assembly, serving until his retirement in 1902 at the age of 73. After his retirement he eventually moved to Saltcoats, where he died in 1918 at the age of 89. Early life, education and career Eakin was born June 14, 1828 in Markham Township, York County, Upper Canada, the eldest of six children to Samuel Baxter Eakin, wagon maker, farmer and merchant and Elizabeth Pingle, of Irish and Danish descent. His brother, George served as postmaster of Unionville, Markham Township from 1864 to 1875, and was also a secretary- treasurer of the town council. William Eakin attended school in his hometown; the schools being operated by the fathers of families in the community. Later he also took tutoring sessions to better his education. He spent his teenage years learning the trade of wagon making, in which his father was employed. He later was sent to Toronto as an apprentice, and learned how to make cabinets and carriages. He also served in the military, receiving his commission as ensign with the Unionville Company of the 12th York Battalion of Infantry in 1866 and retiring from the military in 1872. In the 1850s, he joined his father's business as a wagon maker, where he worked in the family's business. He bought a sawmill in 1854 that was later converted into a carriage manufacturing shop. In 1873, along with his brother, George, Eakin built a planing mill near a new Canadian Pacific Railway line, where they manufactured doors, sashes, wagons, carriages, agricultural implants, cabinets, furniture, and coffins. Known as the Unionville Planing Mill, it was eventually leased out in 1874 and sold in 1881. Early political activities Official speaker portrait of Eakin, by V.A. Long, 1912 In addition to his manufacturing business, Eakin also served an active role in politics while he was living in Markham. He served as a councillor on the Markham Township Council on three separate occasions: 1867, 1871 and 1872, and later served as the reeve of the council in 1873 and from 1879 to February 1883, when he resigned. After spending time with the Reform Association of York, Eakin was appointed Warden of the County of York in 1881. He also served on the public works commission of that same county. Eakin relocated to the North-West Territories in 1883; he set up homestead at Crescent Lake, near Saltcoats, Saskatchewan and worked for the Saskatchewan Land and Homestead Company. He was one of the first European settlers in the area. Two years later he was appointed as a justice of the peace, and later as a licence and affidavit commissioner. When a school system was established in the area in 1887, the Eakin residence served as one of the first classrooms, with William Eakin receiving $1 per month as rent. He later used the carpentry skills learned in his younger years to assist in building a school building as supplies became available the next year. Political career His first attempt for public office came in 1888 when he unsuccessfully ran for the Council of the Northwest Territories. He later ran in 1894 for the new district of Saltcoats and won election to the legislative assembly of the Northwest Territories, as a Liberal. He was also reelected in 1898. During his time in office, as the issue of provincial status for the territories, drawing the borders particularly became a perennial debate. Toward this issue, Eakin was of the belief that the talks were premature, stating the belief that the citizens were content with the current situation and did not see any advantage to provincial status. He was also a proponent of the education system, giving his support in using government funds for the school systems within the territory. In the opening of the 1899 legislative session, Eakin was nominated by premier Frederick Haultain and member Robert Brett to serve in the post as speaker. Praised by his colleagues for his fairness, even temperament and knowledge, he was elected as speaker later that session by his legislative colleagues. Assuming the office at the age of 70, the predominant issues of the session were again those of provincial status for the North-West Territory, and whether boundaries would be drawn to include one or two provinces. On one occasion was Eakin required to use his casting vote as speaker, to break a deadlock on an 1899 bill regarding land titles and offices. Eakin continued as speaker until April 26, 1902, when the assembly was dissolved. Though nominated to serve as speaker once again, Eakin opted to retire due to his health and age. Later life and death After retiring as speaker, Eakin returned to farming at Crescent Lake. A post office was also established at the time in the area, with the name Eakindale. He continued farming until 1911, moving to Saltcoats some time after. Eakin died at this home in Saltcoats on March 14, 1918, one week after celebrating his 65th wedding anniversary with his wife. Aged 89, he was later buried at the Saltcoats Cemetery. His wife died later in the year, on September 9, 1918. Personal life In 1853, Eakin married Margaret Hunter, daughter of Alexander and Lucy Hunter of Markham Township. Alexander Hunter was also active in Markham Township affairs, serving on the town council and as a deputy reeve in 1852. Eakin and his wife had six children; five daughters and one son, Elizabeth, Otelia, Edna, Nella, Margaret, and Gordon. In Markham Township, Eakin was a member and president of the Markham and East York Agricultural Society. In his spare time, he was an avid reader and gardener. He was one of the first members of the Saltcoats Presbyterian Church when it was founded in 1890. At church, he was active in the choir. In the early 1900s, his speaker's chair in the legislature was donated to the Saltcoats Canadian Legion by Saskatchewan Premier Thomas MacNutt.

It was written by and stars John Tartaglia, whose previous theatre acting credits include Avenue Q and Beauty and the Beast. The show played at New World Stages, which is also where the show that launched his career, Avenue Q, played. The book is by Tartaglia, and the musical score is by William Wade. Like Avenue Q, ImaginOcean utilizes puppetry, but unlike that show, ImaginOcean is aimed at children and the actors performing the puppets are not seen onstage. The idea for ImaginOcean came about when show creator John Tartaglia took a snorkeling trip in the Virgin Islands. The show was originally performed on the Royal Caribbean ship Oasis of the Seas before moving to New World Stages. According to a Newsday interview, two foreign productions, a national tour, and a film adaptation of the show were planned. The show utilizes blacklight sets and lighting as well as puppets with fabrics that work well with blacklight, giving the illusion that the puppets are floating against the black background. As such, the show is marketed as the first \\"glow-in-the-dark\\" musical. Characters *Dorsel - A green show fish who is afraid of germs and trying new things. *Tank - An orange anglerfish who is one of Dorsel's best friends *Bubbles - A rainbow fish who is one of Dorsel's best friends *Leonard - A magenta and purple octopus who Dorsel meets after he gets separated from Tank and Bubbles. *Ripple - A seahorse who serves as the protector of Seaweed Scuttle. Synopsis [Overture.] Tank, Dorsel and Bubbles are playing when they discover a treasure map. They decide to follow it to find the treasure and they are led to Shell Reef. [On Our Way.] When they get there, Tank saves a baby jellyfish from being stuck under a rock and in return, the jellyfish family throws a party. [Jellyfish Jive.] On their way to the next location on the map, they lose their way and have to decide which arrow to follow to get to Seaweed Scuttle. [Which Way To Turn.] They eventually figure out which the direction to go and arrive at their next destination. At Seaweed Scuttle, the fish trio meet the protector, a seahorse named Ripple. Ripple informs them that the only way they can pass through is to use their imagination. [Imagination.] Tank, Bubbles and Ripple get sucked away by a giant wave leaving Dorsel alone and scared. Dorsel is initially frightened by an octopus named Leonard, before the two become friends. Leonard enlists Dorsel to help him retrieve his favorite pebble that fell down a small cave. Dorsel overcomes his fear and travels through the cave and successfully gets the pebble. [Just A Stones Throw Away.] Leonard is so thankful to Dorsel that he offers to help him find Tank and Bubbles. [On Our Way, Reprise] They find the treasure chest and instead of gold, diamonds or rubies, they learn that the true treasure is their friendship.

The gap between the two lines has closed as more powerful mills have been developed and installed. While most grinding in the mineral industry is achieved using devices containing a steel grinding medium, the IsaMill uses inert grinding media such as silica sand, waste smelter slag or ceramic balls. The use of steel grinding media can cause problems in the subsequent flotation processes that are used to separate the various minerals in an ore, because the iron from the grinding medium can affect the surface properties of the minerals and reduce the effectiveness of the separation.N W Johnson, M Gao, M F Young and B Cronin, \\"Application of the ISAMILL (a horizontal stirred mill) to the lead‚Äìzinc concentrator (Mount Isa Mines Limited) and the mining cycle,\\" in: AusIMM ‚Äô98 ‚Äì The Mining Cycle, Mount Isa, 19‚Äì23 April 1998 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1998), 291‚Äì297.

First used in the Mount Isa lead‚Äìzinc concentrator in 1994, by May 2013 there were 121 IsaMill installations listed in 20 countries, where they were used by 40 different companies.IsaMillTM installation list. Accessed 25 May 2013. IsaMill Operating Principles The IsaMill is a stirred-medium grinding mill, in which the grinding medium and the ore being ground are stirred rather than being subjected to the tumbling action of older high-throughput mills (such as ball mills and rod mills). Stirred mills often consist of stirrers mounted on a rotating shaft located along the central axis of the mill.C Jayasundara, R Yang, B Guo, A Yu and J Rubenstein, \\"Discrete element method ‚Äì computational fluid dynamics modelling of flow behaviour in a stirred mill ‚Äì effect of operating conditions,\\" in: XXV International Mineral Processing Congress (IMPC) 2010 Proceedings, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, 6‚Äì10 September 2010 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2010), 3247‚Äì3256. . The mixing chamber is filled with the grinding medium (normally sand, smelter slag, or ceramic or steel beads) and a suspension of water and ore particles, referred to in the minerals industry as a slurry. In contrast, ball mills, rod mills and other tumbling mills are only partially filled by the grinding medium and the ore. Figure 2. Schematic view of an IsaMill showing the principles of its operation. In stirred-medium mills, the stirrers set the contents of the mixing chamber in motion, causing intensive collisions between the grinding medium and the ore particles and between the ore particles themselves. The grinding action is by attrition and abrasion, in which very fine particles are chipped from the surfaces of larger particles,M Gao, M Young and P Allum, \\"IsaMill fine grinding technology and its industrial applications at Mount Isa Mines,\\" in: Proceedings of the 35th Canadian Mineral Processors Conference, Vancouver, 28 April ‚Äì 1 May 2002 (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum: Ottawa, 2002), 171‚Äì188. Available from: Accessed 24 May 2013. rather than impact breakage. This results in the generation of fine particles at greater energy efficiency than tumbling mills. For example, grinding a pyrite concentrate so that 80% of the particles are less than 12 ¬µm (0.012 mm) consumes over 120 kilowatt-hours per tonne (kWh/t) of ore in a ball mill using 9 mm balls, but only 40 kWh/t in an IsaMill using a 2 mm grinding medium.J D Pease, D C Curry, K E Barns, M F Young and C Rule, \\"Transforming flowsheet design with inert grinding ‚Äì the IsaMill,\\" in: Proceedings of the 38th Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors (CMP 2006) (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum: Ottawa, 2006), 231‚Äì249. Accessed 24 May 2013. Figure 3. Photograph of an IsaMill disk being pushed into place on the mill's shaft. The slots in the disks are clearly shown. The orange device behind the second disk is the product separator. The IsaMill usually consists of a series of eight disks mounted on a rotating shaft inside a cylindrical shell (see Figure 2).B D Burford and L W Clark, \\"IsaMill technology used in efficient grinding circuits,\\" in: VIII International Conference on Non-ferrous Ore Processing, Poland. Accessed 24 May 2013. The mill is 70‚Äì80% filled with the grinding medium, and is operated under a pressure of 100 to 200 kilopascals. The disks contain slots to allow the ore slurry to pass from the feed end to the discharge end (see Figure 3). The area between each disk is effectively an individual grinding chamber, and the grinding medium is set in motion by the rotation of the disks, which accelerate the medium toward the shell. This action is most pronounced close to the disks. The medium flows back toward the shaft in the zone near the midpoint between the disks, creating a circulation of the grinding medium between each pair of disks, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. Schematic diagram showing the flow patterns of the grinding medium inside an IsaMill. The average residence time of the ore in the mill is 30‚Äì60 seconds. There is negligible short-circuiting of the grinding zone by the feed, as a result of having multiple grinding chambers in series. The ground product is separated from the grinding medium at the discharge end of the mill. This is achieved without using screens by using a patented product separator that consists of a rotor and a displacement body (see Figure 2 and Figure 4). The relatively short distance between the last disk results in a centrifugal action that forces coarse particles towards the mill shell, from where they flow back towards the feed end. This action retains the grinding medium within the mill. The product separator is a very important part of the IsaMill design. It avoids the need to use screens to separate the grinding medium from the ground particles. Using screens would make the mills high- maintenance, as they would be prone to blocking, necessitating frequent stoppages for cleaning. Fine particles are not as susceptible to the centrifugal forces and stay closer to the center of the mill, where they are discharged through the displacement body at a rate equal to the mill‚Äôs feed rate. The design of the IsaMill results in a sharp product size distribution, meaning that the IsaMill can operate in open circuit (i.e. without the need for an external separation of the discharged particles in screens or hydrocyclones to allow coarse over-size product to be returned to the mill for a second pass). It also means that there is less overgrinding at the finer end of the size distribution, such as occurs during the operation of tower mills. History of the IsaMill =The driving force for developing the IsaMill= The development of the IsaMill was driven by MIM Holdings‚Äô desire to develop its McArthur River lead‚Äìzinc deposit in Australia‚Äôs Northern Territory, and by the need for finer grinding at its Mount Isa lead‚Äìzinc concentrator. The mineral grains in the McArthur River deposit were much finer than those of operating mines. Test work had shown that it would be necessary to grind part of the ore so that 80% of the ground particles were less than 7 ¬µm (0.007 mm) if a saleable concentrate of mixed lead and zinc minerals (referred to as a \\"bulk concentrate\\") were to be produced. At the same time, the mineral grain size of the lead‚Äìzinc ore mined and processed at Mount Isa was decreasing, making it harder to separate the lead and zinc minerals.M F Young, J D Pease, N W Johnson and PD Munro, \\"Developments in milling practice at the lead‚Äìzinc concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited from 1990,\\" in: 6th Mill Operators‚Äô Conference, Madang, 6‚Äì8 October 1997 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1997), 3‚Äì12. The liberation of sphalerite (zinc sulfide) grains dropped from over 70% to just over 50% between 1984 and 1991. As a result, the Mount Isa lead‚Äìzinc concentrator was forced to produce a bulk concentrate from the beginning of 1986 until late 1996. Bulk concentrates cannot be treated in electrolytic zinc smelters, due to their lead content, and are typically treated in blast furnaces using the Imperial Smelting Process. The Imperial Smelting Process has higher operating costs than the more common electrolytic zinc process, and therefore the payment received by producers of bulk concentrate is lower than that received for separate lead and zinc concentrates. The zinc in the Mount Isa bulk concentrate was eventually worth less than half that of the zinc in the zinc concentrate. These issues provided a great incentive for MIM to grind its ores finer. MIM metallurgists had undertaken fine grinding test work on samples from both deposits using conventional grinding technologies between 1975 and 1985. However, it was found that conventional grinding had a very high power consumption and that contamination of the mineral surface by iron from the steel grinding media adversely affected flotation performance. It was concluded in 1990 that there was no suitable existing technology for grinding to the fine sizes in the base metals industry. Consequently, Mount Isa‚Äôs head of mineral processing research, Dr Bill Johnson, began looking at grinding practices outside the mining industry. He found that fine grinding was well established for such high-value manufactured products as printer inks, pharmaceuticals, paint pigments and chocolate. =Early IsaMill development work= MIM decided to work with Netzsch, which was a pioneer in the fine grinding field, and still a leader. Test work was undertaken using one of Netzsch‚Äôs horizontal bead mills. It showed that such a mill could achieve the required grind size. However, the mills used in these industries were used on a small scale and were often batch operations. They used expensive grinding media that frequently needed to be removed, screened and replaced so that the mills would continue to operate properly. The traditional grinding medium consisted of silica-alumina-zirconium beads that, in those days, cost about US$25 per kilogram (\\"kg\\") and lasted for only a few hundred hours. Such a high-cost and short-lived grinding medium would be uneconomic in an industry processing hundreds of tonnes of ore an hour. Subsequent test work focussed on finding a cheaper grinding medium that might make the bead mill viable for mineral processing. This work included using glass beads (about US$4/kg) and screened river sand (about US$0.10/kg) before it was found that the rounded beads produced by granulating reverberatory furnace slag from the Mount Isa copper smelter constituted an ideal grinding medium.M Gao, M F Young, B Cronin and G Harbort, \\"IsaMill medium competency and its effect on milling performance,\\" Minerals & Metallurgical Processing, 18(2), May 2001, 117‚Äì120. As a result of the success of the laboratory tests, a larger-scale mill was tested in MIM‚Äôs pilot flotation plant. It was found that the standard mill suffered a very high wear rate, with the disks being severely worn within 12 hours. MIM‚Äôs development efforts focussed on finding a lining that could withstand the wear and on designing a separator that would retain the oversize grinding medium within the mill while allowing the fine ore slurry to exit. =Initial commercialisation (1994‚Äì2002)= With the development of the product separator and changes to reduce the wear rate of the mill, the first two full-scale IsaMills were put into production in the Mount Isa lead‚Äìzinc concentrator in 1994. With 3000 liter (\\"L\\") volumes, they were six times larger than the largest standard mill previously produced by Netzsch. They had a motor size of 1120 kW and allowed the new design and grinding medium to be proven at a commercial scale.G Harbort, M Hourn and A Murphy, \\"IsaMill ultrafine grinding for a sulfide leach process,\\" Australian Journal of Mining, 1998. Accessed 24 May 2013. This model of the IsaMill was designated the \\"M3000\\". Figure 5. Photograph on an IsaMill with the split-shell design to allow easier replacement of the shell liner. This was the first application of stirred mills in the metals mining industry. The development of the IsaMill gave the MIM Holdings Board of Directors the confidence to authorise construction of the McArthur River mine and concentrator. The next four M3000 IsaMills were installed in the McArthur River concentrator in 1995.D N Nihill, C M Stewart and P Bowen, \\"The McArthur River mine‚Äîthe first years of operation,\\" in: AusIMM ‚Äô98 ‚Äì The Mining Cycle, Mount Isa, 19‚Äì23 April 1998 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1998), 73‚Äì82. The first mills installed at Mount Isa and McArthur River initially operated with six disks. The number was increased first to seven disks and finally to the eight disks that are now standard. Figure 6. Schematic diagram of an IsaMill showing how the shell slides away from the shaft and grinding disks to allow easy access to the mill's internal components. The full-scale IsaMills allowed MIM to refine the mill design to allow improved ease of maintenance. For example, the shell design was changed to allow it to split along the horizontal center-line (see Figure 5). This was done to allow the use of a replaceable slip-in liner, avoiding the need for the shell to be sent away for cold rubber lining and the need to have a stock of spare, lined shells. Also, the direction of flow of feed through the mill was reversed, because most of the disk wear occurred at the feed end, which was initially at the drive end of the mill. By changing the feed end to that opposite the drive end, the disks that required most frequent replacement were the first that were removed from the shaft rather than the last (see Figure 6 and Figure 7). Figure 7. Photograph of IsaMills with their shells pulled back, exposing their internal components. While the IsaMills at Mount Isa were operated using screened copper smelter reverberatory furnace slag as the grinding medium, those at McArthur River used screened primary grinding mill fines as the grinding medium for the first seven years of their operation and, in 2004, switched to using screened river sand. The first sale outside the MIM Holdings group also occurred in 1995, with the sale of three smaller \\"M1000\\" IsaMills to Kemira for grinding calcium sulfate at one of its Finnish operations. A fifth M3000 IsaMill was installed in the McArthur River concentrator in 1998 and six more in the Mount Isa lead‚Äìzinc concentrator in 1999. The installation of the IsaMills at Mount Isa, together with some other modifications to the lead‚Äìzinc concentrator, allowed MIM to stop producing the low-value bulk concentrate in 1996. The IsaMills made possible the development of the McArthur River mine. The first sales to external organisations of the M3000 mills were to Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd (\\"KCGM\\"), Australia‚Äôs largest gold producer and a joint venture of Newmont Australia Pty Ltd and Barrick Australia Pacific that operates the Kalgoorlie \\"super pit\\" gold mine in Western Australia and the Gidji Roaster, north of Kalgoorlie.S Ellis and M Gao, \\"The development of ultrafine grinding at KCGM,\\" Society of Mining Engineers 2002 Annual Meeting, Phoenix, Arizona, 25‚Äì27 February 2002. Preprint 02-072. The first of two IsaMills bought by KCGM was commissioned at the Gidji Roaster in February 2001 to supplement the treatment capacity of the roaster. A change in the ore type had resulted in an increase in its sulfur content, which in turn increased the mass of sulfide concentrate produced, thus making the two Lurgi roasters a bottleneck in the gold production process. Studies by KCGM metallurgists had shown that ultrafine grinding was an alternative to roasting as a method of unlocking fine gold that could not be recovered without further treatment (so-called \\"refractory gold\\"), but until the development of the IsaMill, there was no economic method of ultrafine grinding available. In 2015 KCGM completed commissioning of a larger M6000 unit at the Gidgi Roaster and was able to subsequently decommission the two Lurgi roasters. A slight decrease in gold recovery was more than offset by increased availability, with the operation of the Gidgi plant no longer being constrained by air quality control requirements. Removal of the roasters was completed early in 2017, although the impressive stack still remains as a landmark. =The IsaMill goes global (2003‚Äì )= The initial development of the IsaMill was driven by problems encountered treating MIM‚Äôs lead‚Äìzinc ore bodies. The next major leap was driven by problems experienced by South Africa‚Äôs platinum producers, driving the development of larger mills and initiating the global penetration of the technology. Around the beginning of the 21st century, South African platinum mining companies were mining increasing quantities of more difficult platinum ore, resulting in decreasing recoveries of the platinum group metals to concentrate and increasing quantities of chromite, which adversely affects smelter performance. These problems drove the industry to investigate the potential of new developments in stirred-medium grinding. The first mover in the area was Lonmin, which purchased an M3000 IsaMill in 2002. Anglo Platinum, which had at the time 20 operating concentrators around the Bushveld complex,C M Rule and A K Anyimadu, \\"Flotation cell technology and circuit design ‚Äì an Anglo Platinum perspective,\\" Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2007. Accessed 24 May 2013. followed in 2003 with the purchase of a smaller M250 IsaMill for testing in its Rustenburg pilot plant. After doing the test work, Anglo Platinum decided to use a scaled-up version of the IsaMill in its Western Limb Tailings Retreatment (\\"WLTR\\") project. It worked with Xstrata Technology, by then the holders of the marketing rights, and Netzsch to develop the M10000 IsaMill, which has a volume of 10,000 L and, at that time, a 2600 kW drive. The mill used silica, crushed and screened, as the grinding medium. The new mill was commissioned in late 2003 and met Anglo Platinum‚Äôs performance expectations, including almost perfect scale-up. It had lower operating costs than the smaller M3000 unit installed in a similar duty at Lonmin‚Äôs operation. Like the McArthur River mine before it, the WLTR project was only possible because of the advantages conferred by the IsaMill technology. The success of the M10000 unit encouraged Anglo Platinum to look at other applications of the IsaMill technology and, following an extensive program of plant investigations and laboratory test work, it decided to install an M10000 IsaMill with a 3000 kW drive in a mainstream (rather than ultrafine) grinding application. The grinding medium selected was a newly- available and low-cost zirconia-toughened alumina ceramic material, which was developed by Magotteaux International.D C Curry and B Clermont, \\"Improving the efficiency of fine grinding ‚Äì developments in ceramic media technology,\\" in: Randol Conference 2005. Accessed 24 May 2013. The results justified an aggressive roll-out of more IsaMills at Anglo Platinum‚Äôs concentrators, and by 2011, Anglo Platinum had purchased 22 IsaMills for its concentrators.C Rule and H de Waal, \\"IsaMill design improvements and operational performance at Anglo Platinum,\\" in: Metallurgical Plant Design and Operating Strategies (MetPlant 2011), Perth, Western Australia, 8‚Äì9 August 2011 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2011), 176‚Äì192. The majority of the installations are in mainstream inert-grinding applications, producing relatively coarse product particles sizes (for example, 80% of the particles smaller than 53 ¬µm). Anglo Platinum attributed an increase in recovery at its Rustenburg concentrator of over three percentage points to the installation of the IsaMills there. The M10000 IsaMill has proven very popular and sales of the technology have been strong since it launched onto the global stage. IsaMills are now used in lead‚Äìzinc, copper, platinum group metal, gold, nickel, molybdenum and magnetite iron ore applications. Xstrata Technology has recently been developing a larger M50000 model IsaMill, with an internal volume of 50,000 L, with a drive up to 8 MW.\\"IsaMill ‚Äì breaking the boundaries.\\" Accessed: 29 May 2013. Advantages of the IsaMill The advantages of the IsaMill include: * very high power intensities ‚Äì IsaMills operate at power intensities up to 350 kilowatts per cubic meter (\\"kW/m3\\"). For comparison, the power intensity of a ball mill is about 20 kW/m3. This high power intensity allows the IsaMill to produce fine particles at a high throughput rate. The high power intensity of the IsaMill comes from its high stirring speed of about 20 meters per second (\\"m/s\\"). * high energy efficiency ‚Äì the grinding mechanism used in IsaMills is more energy efficient than conventional tumbling mills, which involve lifting the charge inside the mill and allowing it to tumble back to the toe of the charge, grinding the ore by impact breakage rather than the more efficient attrition mechanism. * grinding with an inert medium ‚Äì the use of non-ferrous grinding media in IsaMills avoids the formation of iron hydroxide coatings on the surfaces of fine particles that occurs when using steel balls as the grinding medium.C M Rule, \\"Stirred milling‚Äînew comminution technology in the PGM industry,\\" The Journal of the Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 111, February 2011, 101‚Äì107. The presence of the iron hydroxide coating inhibits flotation of these particles. One study showed that changing from forged steel grinding balls to high chromium steel balls was found to reduce the iron in the surface atomic composition of galena from 16.6% to 10.2%, but grinding with a ceramic medium reduced the surface iron to less than 0.1%. Experience at Mount Isa and other locations has shown that the clean surfaces resulting from the use of IsaMills reduce the quantity of flotation reagents required and improve recovery of the target minerals. Experience at Mount Isa and Anglo Platinum shows that using an inert grinding medium increases the flotation rate (the flotation \\"kinetics\\"), in contrast to the common observation that regrinding using a steel medium slows the flotation kinetics of all minerals. * open- circuit operation ‚Äì the internal product separator (see Figure 8) of the IsaMill effectively replaces the cyclones that would normally be used in a standard milling circuit. These cyclones are used to separate coarse particles that need further grinding from fine particles that are of the desired size. The coarse particles (known as \\"oversize\\") are returned to the mill and form what is known as a \\"recirculating load\\" that takes up a significant portion of the capacity of the mill. The centrifugal action of the product separator results in only the fine particles leaving the mill and the recirculating load is eliminated. Figure 8. Photograph of the patented IsaMill product separator. * a relatively sharp cut size, with minimal generation of \\"super fines\\" ‚Äì the low residence time and the attrition grinding mechanism of the IsaMill results in preferential grinding at the coarse end of the feed stream particle size distribution with little overgrinding. This is more energy efficient and reduces the problem of recovering these super fine particles during subsequent flotation. * the ability to use low-cost grinding media ‚Äì IsaMills have been able to use locally sourced, low-cost materials as the grinding medium, such as discard smelter slag, screened ore particles and river sand. However, these materials are not always appropriate and for coarser grinding, a ceramic grinding medium is used. * ease of access for maintenance ‚Äì the horizontal nature of the IsaMill makes all parts easy to access from a single level for maintenance. High-wear parts are easily replaced. A team of two people can complete a disk and liner change within eight hours.\\"About IsaMill\\". Accessed 28 May 2013. * small footprint ‚Äì because of the high grinding intensity, IsaMills have a small footprint for an equivalent throughput compared with tumbling mills. This contributes to a reduction in the cost of installation of the mills. * lower capital cost ‚Äì the small size of the IsaMill reduces its construction and installation costs relative to larger mills. The capital costs of grinding are further reduced because the IsaMill can be operated in open circuit, so there is no need to purchase and install hydrocyclones and related ancillary equipment. * lower operating cost ‚Äì the energy efficiency of the IsaMill and the relatively cheap grinding medium cost give it a low operating cost for its grinding duty. This lower cost is frequently cited as having made possible the economic processing of mineral deposits that could not previously be profitably developed. IsaMill spin-offs The development of an economic ultrafine grinding technology has made possible atmospheric leaching of minerals for which this was previously impossible. MIM Holdings also developed, through its research facility located in Albion, a suburb of Brisbane, an atmospheric leaching process called the Albion Process. By using IsaMills to grind the particles of refractory minerals to ultrafine sizes, the Albion Process increases the activity of sulfide concentrates to the point where they can be readily oxidised in conventional open tanks. Thus, the oxidation is carried out without the need for high pressure, expensive reagents or bacteria.\\"Simple refractory leaching technology,\\" The Asia Miner, 7, January‚ÄìMarch 2010.

Organized by the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) and students unions nationwide, it saw between 25,000 and 40,000 protesters on the streets of central Dublin during what The Irish Times described as \\"the largest student protest for a generation\\". The protestors came from all over Ireland ‚Äì students from most third-level colleges featured, as did some protestors from Queen's University Belfast ‚Äì with many travelling to the city by coach. It took more than an hour and a half for all the protestors to walk from Parnell Square to Government Buildings in Merrion Street, a short distance. Some protestors and garda√≠ engaged in clashes following the protest, with an unidentified number of people being wounded and three garda√≠ sustaining minor injuries; two arrests were made. The two men who were arrested were in their twenties and charged with criminal damage and a breach of the peace respectively. The Department of Finance was occupied by protestors for a time, and 36 complaints of police brutality were made of which just over half were admitted; these led to a further march by students seven days later with the intention to \\"end garda brutality\\". Presseurop wondered the day after thousands of students marched on the streets of Dublin: \\"Has Ireland awoken?\\" and said the protest had \\"Giv[en] the lie to general opinion that the economically stricken nation has taken swingeing austerity measures with passive resignation\\". \\"Scenes bizarrely similar\\" occurred in London one week later. Background The BBC's Ireland Correspondent Mark Simpson noted that most demonstrations in Ireland had been \\"angry rather than violent\\". One example he alluded to occurred two days before students demonstrated when Minister for Health and Children Mary Harney was successfully pelted with red paint by an opposition politician in a protest intended to highlight the \\"blood budget\\" which \\"will result in the unnecessary and avoidable deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of people over the coming years\\"; this incident occurred while she was attempting to open a mental healthcare facility in Dublin. But Simpson also wrote that \\"It is unlikely that their [students] demonstration will make any difference. [...] They [the Irish government] will be hoping that young people will eventually accept [that Ireland has no money]. After all, most students know what it feels like to be broke\\". March and further events According to The Irish Times, the protest was \\"powerful, uplifting ‚Äì and very peaceful\\". It commenced from Parnell Square at 13:00. T-shirts bearing slogans such as \\"Education not Emigration\\" were worn by many protestors. Students from Queen's University Belfast joined their counterparts on the streets of Dublin for the protest in return for support given to their own protest at Stormont two days earlier. Forty minutes later, some protestors left the march route at Nassau Street and approached D√°il √âireann's front gates on Kildare Street. Some scaled poles and items were thrown through the gates. March organisers sent them back to the main protest. Several dozen protestors entered the Department of Finance's lobby at 15:00 and commenced occupation. Authorities removed some and barricaded the remainder inside. More students gathered outside the entrance where authorities lined up to separate them from those inside the building, while horses and vans were deployed to split those outside into two. A sit- down protest ensued among those who were outside. Riot police arrived on the scene and authorities removed the rest of the protestors still inside the building, some of whom had \\"evidence of a beating on their faces\\" (The Irish Times). Riot police then forced those outside to move backwards, eventually charging at them followed by horses and dogs until they reached the Shelbourne Hotel. A second charge by the authorities forced those in the vicinity back to Anglo Irish Bank. Many of those left outside the Department of Finance then joined a peaceful sit-down protest which was occurring outside D√°il √âireann. Free Education for Everyone then organised a march to Pearse Street garda station, thought to be the destination of those who had been arrested. They collected there and demanded the release of anyone who had been arrested. Complaints of police brutality Two female protesters were reported to have been pulled out of the Department of Finance \\"by their ankles\\" and one by her hair. One bespectacled male student was trampled upon by a horse. A female was kicked and knocked to the ground by a horse. Another who said she was engaging in a peaceful protest was told by police to \\"get the fuck off the street\\" before being batoned. A male sitting peacefully on the ground with his hands out was reported to have been \\"rammed\\" by four garda horses. Blood and facial injuries were a common sight. After viewing video footage of the disorder MEP Joe Higgins said: \\"The use of Garda horses and dogs against student protesters in Dublin on Wednesday is an outrageous abuse of the right to protest. The intention was clearly to intimidate peaceful protesters and it is an utter scandal. They should never again be used against protesters\\". These events led to numerous complaints about police brutality being sent to the Garda S√≠och√°na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC). Within days the number of complaints had more than doubled. Video footage taken by witnesses was to be examined. On 10 November, hundreds of students marched through Dublin again, this time before the banner \\"END GARDA BRUTALITY\\". The Irish Times stated that \\"While members of the Socialist Worker Student Society and the 32 County Sovereignty Movement were present at last night‚Äôs protest, they made up only a small proportion of the crowd\\". Among the protestors was Vanessa O'Sullivan, video footage of whom unconscious was broadcast on YouTube and RT√â. She told the crowd: \\"This day last week I was knocked unconscious by a g√°rda... All I am guilty of is walking inside a public building and sitting down\\".

In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding.

Cu Huy C·∫≠n went on to serve in Vietnam's first National Assembly. V≈©'s mother, Ngo Thi Xuan Nhu, was the sister of the poet Xu√¢n Di·ªáu. Vu graduated with a doctorate in law from France's University of Paris, though he did not become a licensed lawyer in Vietnam. V≈©'s wife Nguyen Thi Duong Ha is also a lawyer, and together they run a law firm in Hanoi. In 2006, Vu made an unsuccessful bid to become the country's Minister of Culture. Activism V≈© attempted to sue Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn T·∫•n D≈©ng on several occasions. In June 2009, he achieved national fame by filing a suit against Dung for granting a Chinese mining company rights to a bauxite deposit. The suit was dismissed by the court. In September and October 2010, V≈© filed suits against D≈©ng for signing Decision No. 136, a measure that banned citizens from filing lawsuits or complaints against the national government. Vu also called in interviews for the revision of Article 4 of the Constitution of Vietnam, which states that the Communist Party is the only legal political party. V≈© stated that he wished for Vietnam to adopt democratic reforms and a multiparty system of government. In October 2010, V≈©'s law firm began the defense of Catholics of Con Dau parish in Da Nang, after police arrested members of the parish for a funeral procession in a disputed area. However, the firm was denied permission to represent the defendants by the Cam Le district People's Court. Trial On 5 November 2010, V≈© was arrested at a hotel in Ho Chi Minh City; police claim to have arrested him when he was with a woman who was not his wife, and briefly posted photos of a half-dressed V≈© with a blurred woman to an official website. V≈©'s home and law office were subsequently searched. Officials later stated Vu had \\"produced documents that opposed the State of Vietnam, employed propagandistic rhetoric as a form of a psychological warfare, demanded the overthrow of the regime and the realization of pluralism and a multiparty system, opposed the interest of the nation, and called for foreign intervention.\\" On 4 April 2011, V≈© was tried on an indictment accusing him of disseminating anti-state propaganda via the Internet, interviews with international media, and other writings. The trial lasted half a day, during which Vu's lawyers walked out after a judge rejected their requests to make public the interviews which Vu was accused of giving. Foreign media was banned from the courtroom, though some reporters were allowed to watch the proceedings via closed-circuit television. V≈© stated to the court that \\"This criminal case was invented against me. This case is completely illegal.\\" In sentencing V≈©, the judge stated that \\"Cu Huy Ha V≈©'s behaviour is serious and harmful to society.

Son's wife Vu Thu Ha stated that Son had been assaulted by police with batons prior to his arrest. The U.S. criticized the sentence, with the U.S. State Department saying that the \\"apparent lack of due process\\" at V≈©'s trial was troubling. Amnesty International declared him a prisoner of conscience and urged his immediate release. Roman Catholic churches held prayer vigils for V≈© in recognition of his work defending the rights of the country's Catholics. Human Rights Watch described the trial as \\"one of the most important cases involving a political dissident in the recent history of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam\\". The organization stated that V≈© was being \\"tried for his political bravery in peacefully challenging abuses of power, defending victims of land confiscation, and protecting the environment ... The government makes a mockery of its international human rights obligations when it persecutes activists like Dr. Vu who try to use the legal system to demand official accountability and rule of law\\". Reporters Without Borders \\"deplored\\" the verdict, stating, \\"We call on the authorities to end their harassment of dissidents, and to begin respecting free speech and the right of each citizen to freely express an opinion.

In 2012, Vu was a finalist for the Front Line Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk, which ultimately went to Syrian blogger Razan Ghazzawi.

She later changed her name to Paakhi, which is her nickname, and adopted Tyrewala after her marriage to Abbas Tyrewala. She was relaunched by her husband Abbas in 2010 with her new name \\"Paakhi\\" in the film Jhootha Hi Sahi. Paakhi has extensive experience behind and in front of the camera as a model, actor, writer and director in the Indian film industry. Over the years, she has gained experience in various fields of film making and has now decided to plunge herself full-time in directing. Having shot her first feature film 'Pahuna' extensively in Sikkim, Paakhi grew fond of the culture there and wanted to play a part in promoting the same nationally. She played a pivotal role in getting AR Rahman on board as the brand ambassador of the state. She is also working with the Sikkim government to create a platform for performing arts and to eradicate the issues of substance abuse and suicide plaguing the state. Early life and family Paakhi was born and brought up in Delhi. Born to a linguistics lecturer and a journalist, Paakhi completed her schooling from Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, but didn't pursue a college education as she was dyslexic. Paakhi is married to director Abbas Tyrewala. They fell in love during the shooting of Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na in which she was the casting director. Career Paakhi A Tyrewala started off her career as a child artist in movies, serials, and theater in 1996. Her first ever performance was when she was two and a half years old. She made her debut as a child artist in 1997, in the film Dance of the Wind. Deep in her heart, she always knew she belonged to cinema. She came to Mumbai in the year 2000 where she started modelling for the biggest brands such as Ponds, Sunsilk, Dabur Vattika, Herohonda, Rayban, Organics etc. She starred in the film Yeh Kya Ho Raha Hai in 2002, in which she played a Russian girl Stella. Since then, she has worked extensively behind the camera as well as in front of it, exploring various departments in the industry along her journey. She worked on a couple of films as a writer, actor and casting director. In 2010 she was cast opposite John Abraham in the film Jhoota Hi Sahi, which was directed by her husband Abbas Tyrewala. She played a suicidal woman called Mishka whose final call mistakenly connects to a man who gives her something to live for. The film received a decent review from the audience, but did not do as expected at the box office. In 2010, she went to TICSH, New York to study film making. In December 2011, Paakhi started working as an Assistant Director with Nagesh Kukunoor for his film, The Boxer, and then his documentary, Lakshmi, in 2012. Her stints as an actor, writer and casting director finally poised her to take flight towards her first love - direction. She helmed her first short film Kajal in 2017 and her first feature film 'Pahuna', produced by Priyanka Chopra's Purple Pebble Pictures is ready for release in December' 2018. = Director = Her first shot at direction was a song she directed in Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na.

Paakhi moved to her first full-length feature film right after, choosing the much ignored and less covered North East region of India to base her story and shoot in. This was a script she wrote 10 years ago and decided to pick up again for her first story. Pahuna is the journey of three kids from Nepal who get separated from their parents and find a home for themselves in the beautiful Indian state of Sikkim. The film has been made in Nepali, a language unknown to Paakhi; proving her to be a fearless filmmaker. Her intentions found a partner in Priyanka Chopra, who decided to produce this unique story under her banner Purple Pebble Pictures. Recently, she has been in the news for the successful premier of Pahuna at Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) 2017, where it was received with a standing ovation. The film also won the Best Film (Jury Choice) in The International Children's Film Festival in Germany and won the Best Film Award by the European Jury and a special mention in International Category at Schlingel Film Festival.

The show was produced by Ajay Sinha. Plot Rukmini a.k.a. Rukmi (Jaya Binju) lives with her father Madan Singh, step-mother Dhapu, younger half-sister Rasal (Toral Rasputra) and half-brother Gheesu. They are poor and struggle to make ends meet. Rukmi, in childhood, had saved Rasal from a fire and got one side of her face burned. Since then, she has been wearing a half veil so that the burn marks are not visible. Rukmi's scarred face acts as a hurdle in her acceptance by society. On the other hand, there is Ranveer (Akshat Gupta), a painter and the son of the most affluent family in the area. He paints a picture of a girl -- who looks exactly like Rukmi -- from his imagination. One day he sees Rukmini and is stunned to know the girl he painted actually exists. He realizes he loves her and proposes to her. Rukmini wants to tell him the truth of her burned face but is unable to do so. She writes him a letter explaining everything. But Dhapu, who wants Rukmi to get married and leave home quickly, changes the letter. Rukmini thinks Ranveer knows the truth. They get married with the blessings of their families. Ranveer, on the wedding night, lifts Rukmini's ghoonghat (veil) and sees her scars. He feels cheated and refuses to accept her as his wife. Ranveer's family wants to get him re-married. Madan Singh asks his younger daughter Rasal to marry Ranveer. Rasal, who is in love with a soldier named Vikram, agrees even though this means losing her love forever. After marriage, Ranveer and his family take a liking to Rasal; but Rukmini is treated like a domestic help. Some time later, Ranveer and Rasal fall in love with each other; they consummate their marriage and she gets pregnant. The entire family is happy; however, Rasal suffers a miscarriage. Later, a very drunk Ranveer forces himself upon Rukmi. She gets pregnant as a result but, for Rasal's sake, does not divulge who fathered the child. Eventually, Rasal gets to know the facts. She forgives Ranveer, as he was not in his senses when the incident happened. Rukmi loses her unborn child in an accident. Ranveer's father was killed by his evil nephew Deep (Mahesh Shetty), who wanted to take over the family's assets. Deep, his mother and maternal uncle go on plotting against Ranveer, Rasal and Rukmi. Only Rukmi knows the truth, but nobody believes her. After some time, Deep attacks Ranveer, who falls off a cliff and is believed dead. Rasal learns that she is pregnant again. Ranveer is rescued by some hermits but loses his memory. He meets Rukmi at the hermitage where he is recovering. Rukmi does not tell him who he is, because Deep is still trying to kill him. Now, Ranveer falls deeply in love with Rukmi and offers to marry her. When his family finds him at the hermitage, he insists on taking Rukmi home with him. Rasal and her in-laws start hating Rukmi because they think she has taken advantage of Ranveer's condition. Gheesu tells Ranveer all about his past life with Rukmi. Ranveer is filled with regret for having treated Rukmi badly and now gives her all due privileges as his wife. Some time later, Rasal's former lover Vikram returns from war, having lost a leg. Ranveer proposes a marriage between Vikram and Rasal. Initially, everyone is outraged, but Ranveer convinces them all. Even Rasal, after great hesitation, agrees. Soon after Vikram and Rasal marry, she gives birth to her and Ranveer's son. Reluctantly, she leaves the baby boy with Rukmi and goes away with Vikram. The child is named Govind. Rukmi promises that she will never have any children of her own, so that Govind remains the sole centre of her attention. Four years later, Vikram and Rasal join Rukmi and Ranveer to celebrate Govind's birthday. The evil Deep tries to harm Ranveer and Govind. However, by now, Ranveer has recovered his memory and realized the truth about his cousin. He foils Deep's attempt. Deep is shot dead by his own father. Rasal and Dhapu ask for Rukmi's forgiveness. The families are happily reunited and Rukmi's patience is rewarded.

When used as a verb, software distribution is the process of delivering software to the end user, while a software distribution, as a noun, (distro) is a collection of software. A software distribution (noun), or distro, is a collection of software components built, assembled and configured so that it can essentially be used \\"as is\\". It is often the closest thing to turnkey form of free software. A distro may take the form of a binary distribution, with an executable installer which can be downloaded from the Internet. Examples range from whole operating system distributions to server and interpreter distributions (for example WAMP installers). Software distributions (noun) can also refer to careware and donateware. In recent years, the term has come to refer to nearly any \\"finished\\" software (i.e. something that is more or less ready for its intended use, whether as a complete system or a component of a larger system) that is assembled primarily from open source components. Examples of Distros (noun) Examples of software distributions include BSD- based distros (such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonflyBSD) and Linux- based distros such as openSUSE, Ubuntu, and Fedora). Distro (noun) support Technical support is a key issue for end-users of distributions, since the distribution itself is typically free and may not be \\"owned\\" in a commercial sense by a vendor. Depending on the distribution, support may be provided by a commercial support vendor, the developers who created the distribution or by the user community itself. Free software distribution (verb) tools GNU Autotools are widely used for which consist of source files written in C++ and the C programming language, but are not limited to these.

The group also includes those of Arab descent from other Middle Eastern Arabic speaking nations. Restricted under Dutch East Indies law until 1919, the community elites later gained economic power through real estate investment and trading. Currently found mainly in Java, especially West Java and South Sumatra, they are almost all Muslims. The official number of Arab and part Arab descent in Indonesia was recorded since 19th century. The census of 1870 recorded a total of 12,412 Arab Indonesians (7,495 living in Java and Madura and the rest in other islands). In 1900, total number of Arab population increases to 27,399 and in 1920 it was 44,902, and 71,335 in 1930. History Indonesia has had contact with the Arab world prior to the emergence of Islam in Indonesia as well as since pre-Islamic times. The earliest Arabs to arrive in Indonesia were traders who came from Southern Arabia and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The early Arabs were Christian Arabs, Sabeans, and Himyarites. Arab traders helped bring the spices of Indonesia, such as nutmeg, to Europe as early as the 8th century. However, Arab settlements mostly began only in the early Islamic era.W.P. Groeneveldt, 1877, Notes on the Malay Archipelago and Malacca, Batavia : W. Bruining. These traders helped to connect the spice and silk markets of South East Asia and far east Asia with the Arabian kingdoms, Persian Empire and the Roman Empire. Some later founded dynasties, including the Sultanate of Pontianak, while others intermingled with existing kingdoms. These early communities adopted much of the local culture, and some disappeared entirely while others formed ethnically distinct communities. More Arabs visited Malay Archipelago when Islam began to spread. Islam was brought to the region directly from Arabia (as well as Persia and Gujarat), first to Aceh. One of travelers who had visited Indonesia was the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta who visited Samudra Pasai in 1345-1346 CE. According to Muslim Chinese writer Ma Huan who visited north coast of Java in 1413‚Äì15, he noted three kinds of people there: Chinese, local people and Muslims from foreign kingdoms in the West (Mideast) who have migrated to the country as merchants. An Arab store in Java circa 1910‚Äì1930 Modern Arab Indonesians are generally descended of Hadhrami immigrants, although there are also communities coming from Arabs of Egypt, Sudan, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Arab States of the Persian Gulf area as well as non-Arab Muslims from Turkey or Iran. Some of these non-Arab muslims arrived during the Ottoman expedition to Aceh, which consisted of Egyptians, Swahili, Somalis from Mogadishu, and Indians from various cities, and states. They were generally from upper strata and classified as \\"foreign orientals\\" (Vreemde Oosterlingen) along with Chinese Indonesians by the Dutch colonists, which led to them being unable to attend certain schools and restricted from travelling, and having to settle in special Arab districts, or Kampung Arab. These laws were repealed in 1919. As liaison and to lead the community, the Dutch government appointed some Kapitan Arabs in the districts. The community elites began to build economic power through trade and real estate acquisition, buying large amounts of real estate in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta), Singapore and other parts of the archipelago. Through charity work and \\"conspicuous consumption\\", they built and protected their social capital; eventually, some Arab Indonesians joined the Volksraad, the people's council of the Dutch East Indies. During the Indonesian National Awakening, an Indonesian nationalistic movement, Persatoean Arab Indonesia, was founded by Abdurrahman Baswedan in 1934, to be more integrated as a citizen of where they lived. To unite with the native in war against the imperialist, to forbid self-isolation, and to fulfill their responsibility as a citizen. Eventually leading to a \\"cultural reorientation\\". The Ampel Mosque at the end of a shopping street in the Arab quarter of Surabaya, January 14, 1927 Women of Hadhrami descent in Palembang, circa 1950 Identity First generation immigrants are referred to as wulayƒÅtƒ´ or totok. They are a small minority of the Arab Indonesian population. The majority, muwallad, were born in Indonesia and may be of mixed heritage. Because of the lack of information, a few Indonesian scholars have mistaken the Arabs of Indonesia as Wahhabism agents, as Azyumardi Azra depicts Indonesians of Arab descent as wishing to purge Indonesian Islam of its indigenous religious elements. Indonesian critics of Arab influence in Indonesia point to the founding of the radical group Jemaah Islamiah (JI) and leadership of Laskar Jihad (LJ) and Front Pembela Islam by Indonesian Arabs. Distribution The majority of Arab Indonesians live in Java and Madura, usually in cities or relatively big towns such as Jakarta, Pekalongan, Solo, Gresik or Surabaya. A sizeable population is also found in Sumatra (primarily in Palembang, and some in West Sumatra, North Sumatra and Aceh), Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Ambon. The earliest census figures that indicate the number of Hadhramis living in Dutch East Indies date from 1859, when it was found that there were 4,992 Arab Indonesians living in Java and Madura. The census of 1870 recorded a total of 12,412 Arab Indonesians (7,495 living in Java and Madura and the rest in other islands). In 1900, total number of Arab population 27,399, 44,902 in 1920, and 71,335 in 1930. Census data shows 87,066 people in 2000, and 87,227 people in 2005, who identified themselves as being of Arab ethnicity, representing 0.040% of the population. The number of Indonesians with partial Arab ancestry, who do not identify as Arab, is unknown. It has been speculated to be several million. Religion alt=Four parallel bar graphs, with the one second from right having a much larger blue bar than others Arab Indonesians are almost all Muslim; according to the 2000 census, 98.27 percent of Arab Indonesians are Muslim, compared to 88.22 percent of the general population. Historically, most have lived in so called kauman villages, in the areas around mosques, but this has changed in recent years. The majority are Sunni, following the Shafi'i school of Islamic law with Ba 'Alawi sada families usually follow Ba 'Alawiyya tariqa. The Islam practiced by Arab Indonesians tends to be more orthodox than the local, indigenous-influenced forms like abangan who do not follow some of the more restrictive Islamic practices. Children are generally sent to madrasahs, but many later advanced their education to secular schools.  Traditions  =Music= Gambus is a popular musical genre among Arab-Indonesians, usually during weddings or other special events. The music is played by a music ensemble consisting of Lute, violins, Marawis, Dumbuk, Bongo drum, Tambourine, Suling (Indonesian version of Ney), and sometimes accompanied with Accordion, Electronic keyboard, Electric guitars, even drum kit. The Lute (Gambus) player (commonly called Muthrib) usually sings while playing the Lute. The music is very similar to Yemeni music with lyrics mainly in Arabic, similar to Khaliji music, where the rhythm is categorized as either Dahife, Sarh or Zafin. In the events, sometimes male-only dancers go to the middle in a group of two or three persons and each group takes turn in the middle of the song being played. =Cuisine= The influence of Hadhrami immigrants in the Indonesian cuisine can be seen in the presence of Yemeni cuisine in Indonesia, such as Nasi kebuli, Mandi rice, Ka'ak cookie, Murtabak, or lamb Maraq (lamb soup or stew). Ancestry As common among Middle-Eastern societies, genealogies are mainly patrilineal. Patrilinearity is even stronger in Sayyid families, where an offspring of non-Hadhrami man and Hadhrami woman is not considered a Sayyid. Many of the Hadhrami migrants came from places in Hadhramaut, such as Seiyun, Tarim, Mukalla, Shibam or other places in Hadhramaut. = DNA = Very few researches and DNA samples, if any, have been done on Arab-Indonesians. It has been guessed that the DNA haplogroups found among Arab Indonesians are J, L and R with higher possibility of J-M267 traces. Haplogroup G-PF3296 is also common, especially among descents of Sayyids of Hadhramaut. It is predicted the presence of mtDNA R9 haplogroups among Arab Indonesians due to mixed marriage between Indonesians and Yemenis .

Outline Based by the massacre of the inhabitants of Oradour-sur-Glane and the subsequent memorialisation of the razed village, the novel recounts the return of a former German soldier, Ernst Kestner, a L√ºbeck pork butcher dying of lung cancer, to the village of Lascaud-sur-Marn where he was quartered, where he fell in love, and where he participated in an unthinkable atrocity. Dealing with themes of guilt and reparation, and memory and its exploitation, the book centres less on the horror of war - which is by no means absent - than on the paradoxical nature of human relations. Kestner's attempts to expiate his remorse collide with his daughter's resistance to know on the one hand, and what one survivor, the local mayor and national deputy, has made of having his own personal history reduced to ashes from one day to the next. A short novel which eschews character development for paradoxical dialogue and plot twist, it is one of Hughes' most successful, having been filmed as Souvenir. In his characterisations of Kestner, his daughter Louise, her husband Henri, and the deputy Lorion, Hughes also attempts to seize upon salient aspects of German and French character, sometimes more to the detriment of the latter than the former.

This new synthesis is analogous to the neoclassical synthesis that combined neoclassical economics with Keynesian macroeconomics. The new synthesis provides the theoretical foundation for much of contemporary mainstream economics. It is an important part of the theoretical foundation for the work done by the Federal Reserve and many other central banks. Prior to the synthesis, macroeconomics was split between New Keynesian work on market imperfections demonstrated with small models and new classical work on real business cycle theory that used fully specified general equilibrium models and used changes in technology to explain fluctuations in economic output. The new synthesis has taken elements from both schools, and is characterised by a consensus on acceptable methodology, empiricism and the effectiveness of monetary policy. Four elements Ellen McGrattan proposed a list of four elements that are central to the new synthesis described by Goodfried and King: intertemporal optimization, rational expectations, imperfect competition, and costly price adjustment (menu costs). Goodfriend and King also find that the consensus models produce certain policy implications. In contradiction with some new classical thought, monetary policy can affect real output in the short-run, but there is no long-run trade-off: money is not neutral in the short-run but it is in the long-run. Inflation has negative welfare effects. It is important for central banks to maintain credibility through rules based policy like inflation targeting. Five principles More recently, Michael Woodford attempted to describe the new synthesis with five elements. First, he stated that there is now agreement on intertemporal general equilibrium foundations. These allow both short-run and long-run impacts of changes in the economy to be examined in a single framework and microeconomic and macroeconomic concerns are no longer separated. This element of the synthesis is partly a victory for the new classical, but it also includes the Keynesian desire for modeling short-run aggregate dynamics. Second, the modern synthesis recognizes the importance of using observed data, but economists now focus on models built out of theory instead of looking at more generic correlations. Third, the new synthesis addresses the Lucas critique and uses rational expectations. However, based on sticky prices and other rigidities, the synthesis does not embrace the complete neutrality of money proposed by earlier new classical economists. Fourth, the new synthesis accepts that shocks of varying types can cause economic output to fluctuate. This view goes beyond the monetarist view that monetary variables cause fluctuations and the Keynesian view that supply is stable while demand fluctuates. Older Keynesian models measured output gaps as the difference between measured output and an ever-growing trend of output capacity. Real business cycle theory did not consider the possibility of gaps and used changes in efficient output, caused by shocks to the economy, to explain fluctuations in output. Keynesians rejected this theory and argued that changes in efficient output were not large enough to explain wider swings in the economy. The new synthesis combines elements from both schools on this issue. In the new synthesis, output gaps exist, but they are the difference between actual output and efficient output. The use of efficient output recognizes that potential output does not grow continuously, but can move upward or downward in response to shocks. Fifth, it is accepted that central banks can control inflation through the use of monetary policy. This is partly a victory for monetarists, but new synthesis models also include an updated version of the Philips curve that draws from Keynesianism.

Biography Randolph was born on the Turkey Island Plantation along the James River in Henrico County, Virginia in 1681. Based on a New Kent County marriage record, Thomas Randolph married Judith Fleming (ca. 1689-ca. 1740) in 1712 and the same Judith Fleming was named as Randolph's widow in a subsequent settlement upon her marriage to Nicholas Davies in 1733. The couple had three children: * William Randolph III (born 1712) married Maria Judith, the daughter of Mann Page, and had four children, including their only son Thomas Mann Randolph Sr. *Judith Randolph (born ~1724) married her first cousin William Stith, President of the College of William and Mary, and had three children. Stith was the son of her Captain John Stith and Mary Randolph, her aunt. *Mary Randolph (born ~1726) married James Keith, a descendant of the Earls Marischal of Scotland, and had eight children. Their daughter Mary Isham Keith was the mother of John Marshall, a United States Secretary of State and Chief Justice of the United States. The historian William Edward Railey reported that Randolph married Churchill in 1710, but she died in 1712 (possibly during the birth of his oldest son, William). Railey notes that Randolph married his second wife, Fleming, that same year on October 16, 1712 in New Kent County, Virginia. This information is now known to be incorrect, and based on the writings of Richard Randolph of Bizarre (1770-1796). Both Thomas Mann Randolph's grandmothers (Richard's great-grandmothers) were named Judith; one was Judith Fleming , married to Thomas Randolph; and the other was Judith Wormeley (1694-1716), step-daughter of Col. William Churchill, married to Mann Page in 1712, and mother of Maria Judith (Page) Randolph. Tuckahoe was reportedly built by Randolph around the time of his marriage to Judith Fleming, but dendrochronology analysis on the house reveals the present dwelling was most likely constructed beginning ca. 1735. His estate was in the part of Henrico County that later became Goochland County. Randolph and his brother William Randolph II were the two representatives from Henrico in the House of Burgesses for the 1720 to 1722 session. He was the county lieutenant for Goochland in 1728. Randolph was a great-uncle of United States President Thomas Jefferson.

Camping, who was then president of the Family Radio Christian network, claimed the Bible as his source and said May 21 would be the date of the Rapture and the day of judgment \\"beyond the shadow of a doubt\\". Camping suggested that it would occur at 6 p.m. local time, with the Rapture sweeping the globe time zone by time zone, while some of his supporters claimed that around 200 million people (approximately 3% of the world's population) would be 'raptured'. Camping had previously claimed that the Rapture would occur in September 1994. The vast majority of Christian groups, including most Protestant and Catholic believers, did not accept Camping's predictions; some explicitly rejected them, citing Bible passages including the words of Jesus stating \\"about that day or hour no one knows\\" (Matthew 24:36).

How about a party instead?, Associated Press, quoted at NBC News, May 18, 2011. Retrieved May 19, 2011 which he considered biblical proofs, in favor of the May 21 end time. A civil engineer by training, Camping stated he had attempted to work out mathematically-based prophecies in the Bible for decades. In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle he explained \\"... I was an engineer, I was very interested in the numbers. I'd wonder, 'Why did God put this number in, or that number in?' It was not a question of unbelief, it was a question of, 'There must be a reason for it.'\\" In 1970, Camping dated the Great Flood to 4990 BC. Using this date, taking the statement in Genesis 7:4 (\\"Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth\\") to be a prediction of the end of the world, and combining it with 2 Peter 3:8 (\\"With the Lord a day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years are as a day\\"), Camping concluded that the end of the world would occur in 2011, 7000 years from 4990 BC. Camping takes the 17th day of the second month mentioned in Genesis 7:11 to be May 21, and hence predicts the Rapture to occur on this date. Another argument that Camping used in favor of the May 21 date is as follows: # The number five equals \\"atonement\\", the number ten equals \\"completeness\\", and the number seventeen equals \\"heaven\\". # The number of days (as calculated below) between April 1, 33 AD, and May 21, 2011 AD, is 722,500. ## Christ is believed by Camping to have hung on the cross on April 1, 33 AD. The time between April 1, 33 AD, and April 1, 2011, is 1,978 years. ## If 1,978 is multiplied by 365.2422 days (the number of days in a solar, as distinct from lunar, year), the result is 722,449. ## The time between April 1 and May 21 is 51 days. ## 51 added to 722,449 is 722,500. # (5 √ó 10 √ó 17)2 or (atonement √ó completeness √ó heaven)2 also equals 722,500. Camping said that 5 √ó 10 √ó 17 is telling us a \\"story from the time Christ made payment for our sins until we're completely saved.\\" Camping was not precise about the timing of the event, saying that \\"maybe\\" we can know the hour.Countdown to Armageddon: Maybe the World Will End Friday Night (or Sunday Morning), Slate, May 7, 2011.

When the Rapture failed to occur on the appointed day, Camping said he had made a mathematical error. Criticism A demonstrator at Radio City Music Hall. Camping's rapture prediction, along with some of his other teachings and beliefs, sparked controversy in the Christian and secular Western worlds. His critics often quoted Bible verses (such as ) they interpret as saying that the date of the end will never be known by anyone but God until it actually happens. However, Camping and his followers responded that this principle only applied during the \\"church age\\" or pre-Tribulation period and did not apply to the present day, citing other verses (such as ) in their rebuttal. In a 2001 pamphlet, Camping asserted that believers should \\"flee the church\\", resigning from any church they belong to, because the \\"Church Age\\" is over and the \\"Great Tribulation\\" has begun. This assertion was controversial and drew \\"a flurry of attacks\\". Edwin M. Yamauchi critiqued Camping's dating of the Flood when Camping first published his ideas in 1970. Criticism of the May 21 prediction ranged from serious critique to ridicule. Theology professor Matthew L. Skinner, writing at the Huffington Post, noted the \\"long history of failed speculation\\" about the End Times and cautioned that end-of-the-world talk can lead Christians to social passivity instead of \\"working for the world's redemption\\".

These succulents commonly have a reddish stem and leaves that are green, but also a variegated cultivar is often seen in cultivation. They are simple to care for and make easy houseplants for a sunny location. In frost-free regions they may be used in outdoor landscaping. Description It is a soft-wooded, semi-evergreen upright shrub or small tree, usually tall. Similar in appearance to the unrelated \\"jade plant\\" Crassula ovata (family Crassulaceae), P. afra has smaller and rounder pads and more compact growth (shorter internodal spaces, down to ). It is much hardier, faster growing, more loosely branched, and has more limber tapering branches than Crassula once established. The genus Portulacaria has been shown to be an outlier, relatively unrelated to the other genera in the family, which are all restricted to small ranges in the arid far west of Southern Africa. Distribution and habitat It is very widespread in the east of South Africa (including Eswatini). In this moist climate, it is relatively rare, and tends to favour dryer rocky outcrops and slopes. It is also found in much denser numbers in the dryer southern Cape. Here it occurs from the Little Karoo of the Western Cape, eastwards up until the thicket vegetation of the Eastern Cape. Spekboom is found most prolifically in the Albany thickets, a woodland ecoregion, which locally is often called ', after the high number of succulent Euphorbia species, which are often called ' plants. Cultivation and uses \\"Prostrata\\" decumbent variety In the wilds of South Africa, large plants do survive the winter frosts by growing dense enough to provide their own natural cover. Drought-tolerant and fire-resistant, it will endure desert sun and heat once established, which the jade plant will not. Portulacaria is a common landscape plant in Phoenix, Arizona and southern California. Cuttings root very easily in most potting media. =Ornamental= P. afra cultivated as a bonsai It is popular as a specimen for bonsai, and as a hardy xeriscaping plant. Several varieties exist - some bred in cultivation, others naturally occurring: * \\"Limpopo\\": A variety with much larger leaves. It is the natural form from the far north of the species' range. * \\"Prostrata\\": A low-lying, decumbent form that is frequently used as a ground-cover. * \\"Aurea\\": A compact, upright form with rounded leaves that go bright yellow in the sun. * \\"Foliis variegatus\\": A variegated form. * \\"Medio-picta\\": Variegated with a lighter centre. =Food source= In Southern Africa it is commonly eaten, usually as one component of a salad or a soup. It should not to be confused with the jade plant, which is mildly toxic. =Carbon sequestration= It is capable of either or CAM carbon fixation, depending on factors such as the season and the age of the leaves.

Haley in 1956, Metalaw was the term Haley coined to refer to his hypothesis regarding the proposed existence of fundamental legal precepts of theoretically universal application to all intelligences, both human and hypothesized intelligent extraterrestrial life. Writer Frank G. Anderson proposed that the definition be expanded to cover all intelligent species, extraterrestrial and terrestrial - which would include any/all intelligent animal life. In 1956, Haley first published an article entitled ‚ÄúSpace Law and Metalaw ‚Äì A Synoptic View,‚ÄùAndrew G. Haley, Space law and Metalaw ‚Äì A Synoptic View, Harvard Law Record 23 (November 8, 1956) in which Haley first proposed what he called an ‚ÄúInterstellar Golden Rule‚Äù: Do unto others as they would have you do unto them. According to Haley, humans can project only one principle of human law onto our possible future relations with extraterrestrial intelligence: ‚Äúthe stark concept of absolute equity.‚Äù Haley developed his formulation of Metalaw somewhat further in various papers and a 1963 book.Andrew G. Haley, Space Law and Government, Appleton Century Crofts, New York, 1963  Elaboration by Ernst Fasan  Significant elaboration of Haley's ideas did not take place until the publication in 1970 of Relations with Alien Intelligences: The Scientific Basis of Metalaw,Ernst Fasan, Relations with Alien Intelligences: The Scientific Basis of Metalaw, Berlin Verlag, Berlin, 1970 written by Dr. Ernst Fasan. In Relations with Alien Intelligences, Fasan proposed Metalaw is ‚Äúthe entire sum of legal rules regulating relationships between different races in the universe.‚Äù Metalaw is the ‚Äúfirst and basic ‚Äòlaw‚Äô between races‚Äù providing the ‚Äúground rules‚Äù for a relationship if and when humans establish communication with or encounter an intelligent extraterrestrial race elsewhere in the universe. Fasan asserted that these rules would govern both human conduct and that of extraterrestrial races so as to avoid mutually harmful activities. In later papersErnst Fasan, Discovery of ETI: Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Legal Implications, Acta Astronautica 21 (2) (1990) 131-135Ernst Fasan, Legal Consequences of a SETI Detection, Acta Astronautica 42 (10-12) (1998) 677-679 published in the 1990s that more directly related Metalaw to SETI, Fasan proposed a simple 3-prong formula of metalegal principles. That formula involves: # A prohibition on damaging the other race. # The right of a race to self-defense. # The right to adequate living space.  Criticism of Metalaw  Several authors have criticized the metalegal principles proposed by Haley and Fasan for their reliance on Immanuel Kant‚Äôs Categorical Imperative and on an approach to legal science and jurisprudence known as natural law theory. In jurisprudence, natural law theory refers generally to the view that links law to morality and proposes that just laws are immanent in nature and independent of the lawgiver, waiting to be discovered or found (as opposed to created by humans), usually by means of reason alone.G.S. Robinson, Ecological foundations of Haley‚Äüs Metalaw, Journal of the British Interplanetary Society 22 (1969) 266-274 Other commentators have noted that Haley‚Äôs formulation of Metalaw depends heavily upon subjective or relative (and therefore inadequate) concepts of ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad.‚ÄùF. Lyall, P.B. Larsen, Space Law: A Treatise, Ashgate Publishing Company, Burlington VT, 2009 Critics have noted that there is no guarantee that other civilizations would abide by Haley‚Äôs assertions regarding equity among intelligent races in the universe.G.H. Reynolds, International space law: Into the Twenty-First Century, Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 25 (1992) 225-255 Haley‚Äôs failure to acknowledge the obvious anthropocentric limits of natural law theory has led some to note that the cultural concept of rules or law is itself anthropocentric.G.S. Robinson, note 7, supra  Metalaw in popular culture  In Have Space Suit ‚Äî Will Travel, a 1958 story by science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein and published two years after Haley's 1956 paper, one of the characters mentions ‚Äúspace law and meta-law.\\" G.

The barahi temple of Chaurasi is unique in more than one way. The image enshrined in this temple is considered to be one of the masterpieces among the images of the deity found all over India. History and Tradition This temple was built in honour of Varahi in the first quarter of 10th century A.D. during Somavamsi rule. The temple is east facing and built with Sandstone. The area dimension (L x B x H) of the temple is 15.84 m x 8.23 m x 8.40 m.The goddess associated with yoganidra of Vishnu on the shreekhetra site Varahi is believed to be the Sakti of Varaha. In the Tantric text 'Varahi Tantra' mention has been made of five forms of Varahi i.e., Svapna Varahi, Canda Varahi, Mahi Varahi (Bhairavi), Kruccha Varahi and Matsya Varahi. The description of Matsya Varahi closely corresponds to the image enshrined in the temple. She has two arms and she is shown seated in lalitasana on a pedestal. Following the iconographic canons, the image bears the face of a boar and body of a divine woman. Her right hand holds a fish while the left hand holds a kapala. She has kept her right foot on her vahana (vehicle) buffalo which is seated on the pedestal at the bottom. Varahi is represented with a third eye on her forehead which is not clearly visible at present. Her hair is decorated in the form of spiral coils. The beauty of this image lies in her big belly to indicate her as holding the universe in her womb. On the back slab two vidyadharas are represented each on either side. In addition to the main deity in the sanctum two more images of Varahi which are smaller than the main image are placed in the Jagamohana. Both of them are seated in ardhaparyankasana. Among them the image in the right niche is shown with a fish in her right hand and a kapala in her left hand. At the bottom a figure of naravahana is placed on the pedestal. The four-armed Varahi in the left niche holds a kapala in the lower left hand and is shown with Varada mudra in the corresponding right hand. The upper right hand holds a fish and left hand holds a rosary. Varahi temple of Satabhaya (Cuttack) Banchua (Keonjhar district), Narendrapur (Balasore district) are the other places in the state where she is worshipped. Images of Varahi have also been found from Puri, Jajpur, Dharmasala Ayodhya, Danagandar, Kisenpur, Tarapur, Padagadi, Kantilo, Garudapancana, Bayalishbati, Chatesvar, Bhubaneshwar, Pallur Kanchipuram. Architecture Rear lateral view of temple Viewed from architectural point, the temple of Varahi in Chaurasi is the most beautiful monument in the Prachi Valley. This temple marks a significant deviation from the usual tradition of Rekha and the Bhadra type and exhibits a novel style which according to Orissan nomenclature is of Khakhara or Gaurichara variety. The ground plan of it somewhat resembles that of the Baitala Deula in Bhubaneswar, but while the plan of the latter admits of no regular ratha protection, this temple presents a pancharatha type both in plan and construction.4 The Vimana is rectangular in cross section and with its elongated vaulted roof and other architectural features it resembles more with the Gauri temple of Bhubaneswar than with the Vaital temple. The vase of the Vimana measures 18 ft by 22 ft and height of it is 27 ft. The Jagamohana which is also rectangular in shape like that of the Parsuramesvara is a pidha temple with seven distinct tires of pidhas. The walls of both the Vimana and Mohana are beautifully decorated with the figural and arabesque motifs and maintain a high order of balance and rhythm. The noteworthy reliefs are found on a single board that surrounds the whole jagamohana just below the baranda where scenes from Ramayana such as killing of the illusory deer, the abduction of Sita, the murder of Jatayu, the uprooting of seven palm trees, the murder of Vali, the construction of the bridge over the sea are depicted with grace and precision. The majestic moulding, designs and carvings of the entire temple are found in remarkable varieties and profusion not being overdone and accentuated the singular beauty and richness of the monuments in a manner that was hitherto unknown in the Prachi Valley. The main temple is like the Khakhara style belonging to Kalinga Kingdom architecture. Other such example is Vaital Deula, in Bhubaneshwar. Spreading over about 2 acres of land, this shrine is Shakta and the presiding deity of the temple is Goddess Varahi, locally called as Matsya Varahi. She sits in lalitasana on a cushion placed on a plain platform with her right foot resting on the buffalo mount carved on the pedestal. She is presented as the pot-bellied goddess with the face of a boar. She has two arms and holds a fish in her right hand and a bowl in her left hand. A third eye is tightly engraved into her forehead. Here Barahi is worshipped in accordance with the tantric rituals. Goddess Varahi is offered fish every day. The semicylindrical shape of the temple shows the variation from the medieval temples of Odisha. Daily the Mahaprasad of Lord Jagannath comes to this temple. Festivals Major festivals includes Vijaya Dashami and a fair in Chaitra. Location Chaurasi is situated between Nimapada-Kakatpur road and is at a distance of 30 kilometers from Konark and 14 kilometers from Kakatpur village with easy transport available from Puri and Konark.

LFB is commonly used to detect demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS), but cannot discern myelination in the peripheral nervous system. Procedure Luxol fast blue is a copper phthalocyanine dye that is soluble in alcohol and is attracted to bases found in the lipoproteins of the myelin sheath. Under the stain, myelin fibers appear blue, neuropil appears pink, and nerve cells appear purple. Tissues sections are treated over an extended period of time (usually overnight) and then differentiated with a lithium carbonate solution. Combination methods The combination of LFB with a variety of common staining methods provides the most useful and reliable method for the demonstration of pathological processes in the CNS. It is often combined with H&E; stain (hematoxylin and eosin), which is abbreviated H-E-LFB, H&E-LFB.; Other common staining methods include the periodic acid-Schiff, Oil Red O, phosphotungstic acid, and Holmes silver nitrate method.

The PrasƒÅda offered to him and later to Maa Bimala in the Grand Temple (SriMandir) is known as 'Mahaprasad'. Earthen Pots containing Mahaprasada being carried during Rath yatra Mahaprasada and Meaning 'Mahaprasad' is of two types. One is Sankudi mahaprasad and the other is Sukhila mahaprasad. Both the types are available for sale in Ananda Bazaar of the Grand Temple. *Sankudi mahaprasad includes items like rice, ghee rice, mixed rice, cumin seed and asaphoetida-ginger rice mixed with salt, and dishes like sweet dal, plain dal mixed with vegetables, mixed curries of different types, Saaga Bhaja', Khatta, porridge etc. All these are offered to the Lord in ritualistic ways. It is said that every day 56 types of Prasad are offered to the Lord during the time of worship and all of these are prepared in the kitchens of the temple and sold to the devotees in Ananda Bazaar by the Suaras who are the makers of the Prasad. * Sukhila mahaprasad consists of dry sweetmeats. Besides Sankudi and Sukhila mahaprasad another type of dry mahaprasad is Nirmalya. This is also known as Kaibalya. In spiritual recognition Nirmalya is equally important as Mahaprasad. There is a belief among Hindus that if Nirmalya is given to a person on his death bed, he is certain to find a place for himself in the heaven after his death following atonement of all his sins. Nirmalya is commonly understood as dry-rice i.e. rice dried up in hot sun in Kaibalya Baikuntha. As laid down in the Skanda Purana things like flowers, sandal paste, garlands, etc. which are treated with reverence on the Lord including the other divine deities seated on Ratnasinmhasan (throne) in the temple are also known as Nirmalya after they are taken out from the deities. It is thus established that any of the divine accompaniments or components that is taken out of the Lord and his divine associates is known as Nirmalya. Four hallowed shrines located at cardinal points of the Indian sub-continent i.e. Puri, Rameswar, Dwarika and Badrinath are believed to have been liked by Lord Vishnu intimately. It is said and believed that He takes His bath at Rameswaram, meditates at Badrinath, dines at Puri and retires at Dwarika. Hence, the temple food \\"Mahaprasad\\" (not simply prasad) at Puri is held to be of supreme importance. According to \\" Skanda Purana\\" Lord Jagannath redeems the devotees by permitting them to partake His Mahaprasad, to have His darshan and to worship Him by observing rituals and by offering of gifts. Mahaprasad is treated here as 'Anna Brahma'. The temple kitchen has got the capacity to cook for a lakh of devotees on a day. Mahaprasad is cooked only in earthen pots and using fire wood as fuel. The steam-cooked food is offered to Lord Jagannath first and then to Bimalaa Debi after which it becomes Mahaprasad. This Mahaprasad is freely partaken by people of all castes and creeds without any discrimination. The items offered include cooked rice, dal, vegetable curry, sweet-dishes, cakes etc. Dry confectioneries are prepared of sugar, gur, wheat flour, ghee, milk and cheese ( Chenna) etc. Legend has it that when the steam cooked food is carried to the Lord in slings of earthen pots no essence can be smelled from the food but when the same is carried back to the sale point (Anand Bazar) after being offered to the Lord, a delicious smell spreads along in the breeze to the pleasant surprise of the devotees. Now the food is blessed. Mahaprasad consolidates human bond, sanctifies, sacraments and grooms the departing soul for its journey upwards. Mahaprasad are sold in Anand Bazar or the Happiness Mart of the temple which is situated on the north east corner of the outer enclosure of the temple. It is the biggest open-air hotel in the world where every day thousands of devotees purchase and eat together. Most of the residents in and around Puri depend upon this Mahaprasad to entertain their guests during social functions such as thread ceremony and weddings. In all auspicious occasions in Odia Hindu families, Mahaprasad is partaken first. The tourists prefer to carry a particular type of dry Mahaprasad known as\\" Khaja\\" (made of maida, sugar and ghee) which stays fresh for days together. Mahaprasad is ceased to be offered from the first day of the Ratha Yatra till the day the deities return to their bejeweled throne. Dried rice Mahaprasad known as ‚ÄúNirmalya‚Äù is also used by devotees and tourists for different sacred occasions. Daily food offerings Mahaprasad served on a plantain leaf There are six particular times a day, starting from early morning, when different kinds of Pitha, vegetables, rice and dal are offered to Jagannath and his sibling deities. Locally the offerings are called Dhupa when offered through Sodasa (16) Upchars and Bhoga when offered through pancha upacharas. The most popular is the midday Naivedhya, which contains the maximum number of food items. The items are not cooked by any human beings, but rather the ingredients are put in earthen vessels and kept on a wooden fire. After time has passed, the items are taken away from fire and taken by supakaras to the Sanctum sanctorum or Garbhagriha for offering. The naivedhya is thereafter offered to the sibling deities that is again offered to Bimalaa, a form of Shakti. Then the prasad becomes Mahaprasad and people partake the mahaprasad. When the Sun stays in the zodiac Dhanu, during that time an additional naivedhya is given before sunrise which is called Pahili Bhoga. Daily offerings to the Lord include: # Gopala Vallabha Bhoga: The first offering to the Lord in the morning that forms his breakfast. # Sakala Dhupa: The Sakala Dhupa forms his next offering at about 10 O‚Äô clock in the morning. This generally consists of 13 items including the Enduri cake and Mantha puli. # Bhoga mandapa bhoga: The next repast and the offering consists of Pakhala with dahi and Kanji payas. The offerings are made in the bhog mandapa, about 200 feet from the Ratna Vedi. This is called Chatra Bhog and was introduced by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century to help pilgrims share the temple food. # The Madhyanha dhupa forms the next offering at the noon. # Sandhya Dhupa: This offering to the Lord is made in the evening at around 8 o‚Äôclock. # Bada Simhara Bhoga: The last offering to the Lord. Except Gopal Ballav Bhog and Bhog Mandap all other 4 bhogs are offered near the Ratnabedi inside the frame of Phokaria which is being drawn by the Puja pandas using Muruj. The items that form the core of offerings to Lord Jagannath‚Äôs Mahaprasad are: =Gopal Ballabhaw Bhog (Breakfast at 8.30 am)= The offering is the first one of the daily Prasad to Lord Jagannath. The Bhogs are offered at the Anabsar Pindi. Breakfast is a seven item treat - Khua (Condensed milk), Lahuni (Butter), Nadia Kora (grated sweet coconut) , coconut water, Khawi (rice puffs sweetened with sugar) and Dahi (curd), and Pachila Kadali (ripe bananas). * Ballabhaw Khawi - 44 Oli * Pachila Kadali (Ripe Banana) - 7 Nos * Nadia Khudi - 3 Sara * Big Kora - 29 Nos * Small Kora - 220 Nos Members of Sevayats conduct this Puja in 5 Upchars. The sevayats who conduct this ritual are Puja Panda, Sudha Suar, Ballav Jogania, Suar Badu, Gara Badu, Palia Maha Suar. In the month of Dhanu Sankranti, Ballav Bhog is offered along with Pahali Bhog. Similarly on the DolaPurnima and Snana Purnima days, the Ballav Bhog and Sakal Dhup are taken up at one time. During Anabasar the Bhogs are offered near Jay-Vijay door as Sarpamanohi, but not on ballav pindi. =Sakala Dhupa (Morning meal at 10.00 am)= This is the first cooked meal Bhog. This bhoga is also called 'Kotha bhoga' or 'Raja bhoga' The Sevaks offer this Bhoga with 16 Upchars on sitting on Ratnavedi.

Poractant alfa is an extract of natural porcine lung surfactant. As with other surfactants, marked improvement on oxygenation may occur within minutes of the administration of poractant alfa. The new generic form of surfactant is SLS (Sheep Lung Surfactant) developed in PersisGen Co. and commercialized by ArnaGen Pharmad. It has fully comparable quality profile with Curosurf.  Pharmacology  Each milliliter of poractant alfa contains 80 mg of surfactant (extract) that includes 76 mg of phospholipids and 1 mg of protein of which 0.2 mg is surfactant protein B (SP-B). Depending on local country registration, CUROSURF is available in 1.5mL vials, 3.0mL vials, and/or twin packs containing two 1.5mL vials. The amount of phospholipids is calculated from the content of phosphorus and contains 55 mg of phosphotidylcholine of which 30 mg is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine.  Other adverse effects  Transient episodes of bradycardia, decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, or endotracheal tube blockage may occur. Mechanism of action Endogenous pulmonary surfactant reduces surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveoli during mechanical ventilation and stabilizes the alveoli against collapse at resting transpulmonary pressures.Ainsworth SB, Beresford MW, Milligan DW, et al, ‚ÄúPumactant and Poractant Alfa for Treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome in Neonates Born at 25-29 Weeks' Gestation: A Randomised Trial, Lancet, 2000, 355(9213):1387-92.

The candidates' personality and aptitudes are determined by techniques including interviews, group exercises, presentations, examinations and psychometric testing. History An early example of assessment is the story of Gideon selecting the most suitable Israelite warriors: In modern times, the German army introduced assessment techniques for selecting its officers in the 1930s. Psychologist Max Simoneit was appointed to head the army's laboratory and introduced leadership tests. These were terminated in 1941 after too many favoured candidates had failed them. Assessment centres were created in World War II to select officers and are still commonly used in military recruitment today. Examples include the Admiralty Interview Board of the Royal Navy and the War Office Selection Board of the British Army. After World War 2, The OSS type of assessment center was essentially abandoned in The United States except for some internal use in intelligence gathering operations by the CIA. The British Civil Service Selection Board and Australians identified participants still used it for selection on their military college. Also, South Africans used the technique to identify supervisors in gold mines. Assessment centers specifically applied for industrial usage can be traced back to the early 1950s and the pioneering work of Robert K Greenleaf and Douglas W. Bray of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T;). Douglas W. Bray as a director of human resources at AT&T;, directed a study that lasted over 20 years and followed the careers of young business managers as they progressed up the telephone company rankings. This study showed that the assessment center method could successfully predict organizational achievement and was later implemented throughout AT&T; and later on adopted by many other companies: IBM, Standard Oil (Ohio) and Sears for example. In 1975, the first guidelines on the use of assessment centers was created as a statement of the considerations believed to be most important for all users of the assessment center method. The guidelines ensure the integrity of the process, the validity of the data, qualifications of assessors, and the rights of the participants. The guidelines have since been revised several times to reflect current legality issues, global insights, and technological advances in the field. The most current version of the Guidelines and Ethical Considerations for Assessment Center Operations was endorsed by the 38th International Congress on Assessment Methods in Alexandria, Virginia in October 2014. Today, The ACM is used by organizations all over the world in both private and public sectors to better select of employees and identifying their development in different areas. AT&T; created a building for recruitment of staff in the 1950s. This was called The Assessment Centre and was influential on subsequent personnel methods in other businesses. Other companies use this method to recruit for their graduate programmes by assessing the personality and intellect of potential employees who have recently graduated from university and have nil or limited work history. The big four accountancy firms conduct assessment centre days to recruit their trainees. 68% of employers in the UK and USA now use some form of assessment centre as part of their recruitment/promotion process. In recent years companies have been set up to support assessment centre coaching. Purpose Assessment center is not just a building for assessing a job candidate, it is a process of evaluation of behaviour based on multiple evaluation including: job related simulations, interviews or psychological tests. The ultimate reason for having an assessment centre in any organization is to gather all relevant information under a standardized conditions about an individual's capabilities to perform a given task. Assessment centers are often the method of choice for selecting senior leaders in government and municipal jobs, including police chief and fire captains. During the process of assessing candidates, series of exercises that are designed to simulate the condition of a given job are given to the candidate to do. This helps the assessor to determine if the candidate possesses the necessary skill and behaviour needed for the job. The assessment center method provides a sort of wide-ranging, multidimensional assessment that has a strong record of both research significance and practical effectiveness to be accepted by participants and decision-makers alike. In essence, the purpose of assessment centre is to examine the skills and psychological state of an individual in order to determine his or her performance.

Career  Her career spanned nearly 50 years, and she primarily worked in the fields of movie dubbing and band- singing. She initially became known to Hollywood casting people from an early marriage to pianist Freddie Slack in the 1940s and later through her long employment with Les Brown and his Band of Renown. Following some early appearances with Sonny Burke and his orchestra, Greer recorded for Decca Records and joined Ray Anthony's band, with whom she scored her two biggest hits, \\"Wild Horses\\" (No. 28 in Billboard) and \\"The Hokey Pokey\\" in 1953. After four unhappy months, she replaced Lucy Ann Polk as vocalist with Les Brown's band in May 1953. They made numerous singles for Coral Records and later Capitol Records and toured internationally for nearly 40 years, well into the early 1990s. She won the 1956 Down Beat Readers Poll for \\"best girl band vocalist.\\" Greer became increasingly associated with her distinctive version of Brown's hit song \\"Sentimental Journey\\", which he had originally recorded with Doris Day. Her other career was as a secret \\"ghost\\" singer for famous movie stars. In 1952, Rita Hayworth had returned to Hollywood following the break-up of her marriage to Prince Aly Khan and began work on her \\"comeback\\" film, Affair in Trinidad. After several failed attempts to let Hayworth try to do her own singing, musical director Morris Stoloff brought in Greer, who was deemed a good vocal match and even had a slight lisp similar to Hayworth's. Greer's vocals on \\"Trinidad Lady\\" and \\"I've Been Kissed Before\\" helped the movie become a big box-office hit, even out-grossing Gilda by more than a million dollars. Greer continued to be in big demand as a dubber, especially at Columbia Pictures, and went on to do the vocal tracks for such stars as Gloria Grahame (in Naked Alibi), Kim Novak (in 5 Against the House), May Wynn (in The Caine Mutiny), Esther Williams (in Jupiter's Darling), June Allyson (in The Opposite Sex), and Susan Kohner (in Imitation of Life). Other dubbing work at Columbia included the Dan Dailey-starrer Meet Me at the Fair (for Carole Mathews) and Frankie Laine's Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder (for Charlotte Austin, daughter of entertainer/songwriter Gene Austin). She also sang for Hayworth in two more of her biggest successes, Miss Sadie Thompson and Pal Joey. When the latter two soundtrack albums were released by Mercury Records and Capitol Records respectively, however, Greer's name was not even listed, in order to preserve the illusion that it was Hayworth who sang. Greer and Hayworth enjoyed a good working relationship on all three of the films they did together. Hayworth would attend Greer's recording sessions and dance barefoot for her in front of the microphone, so that Greer could follow her breathing and movements as she sang. Stoloff also utilized Greer's talents for two projects on the newly formed Colpix Records label, having her record \\"My Funny Valentine\\" (he supposedly had never liked the version done by another singer for Kim Novak in Pal Joey), and Hayworth's signature song \\"Put the Blame on Mame\\" for the album Voices, Soundtracks and Themes From Great Movies (Greer's name was once more left off both the label and the jacket). The second Colpix album was more ambitious, an original film noir-style musical entitled The Naked City, named to tie in with the popular film and TV series, with music by George Duning, text and lyrics by Ned Washington and narration by veteran actor John McIntire. The singing was done by Greer, James Darren, and the Jud Conlon Singers. This time their names were listed in tiny print on the record label, but left off of the LP cover. It was released in stereo as Colpix SCP 505. Greer never got to record a vocal album of her own, but some of her many singles have been reissued on CD, most of her films are available on DVD and many CD collections have been released of her broadcasts and live performances with the bands of Anthony, Burke and Brown, including shows from the Hollywood Palladium, Denver's Elitch Gardens and the 1983 Aurex Jazz Festival in Tokyo, Japan. She also made one on-screen appearance as herself in the 1957 Universal-International musical short Dance Demons, in which she sings \\"Moonlight in Vermont\\" with the Les Brown band. In 1991, while still performing occasionally with the Brown band (now mostly led by Les, Jr.), she was part of a successful cabaret show called Voices,\\"'Voices' Revue to Open Aug. 27\\", Los Angeles Times, August 16, 1991. which also featured two other prominent \\"ghost\\" singers, Annette Warren and India Adams. They were invited to perform at one of that year's Oscar events by the Motion Picture Academy. A CD compilation of her work was produced by her last manager Alan Eichler and released in 2012 by Jasmine Records.\\"Jo Ann GREER - Hollywood's Secret Singing Star\\", Jasmine Records.  Personal life  Greer's second marriage was to Stan Stout, a trumpet player with the Les Brown orchestra, and following their divorce she married another trumpet player, Mickey McMahan. She also appeared with him on three episodes of the Lawrence Welk Show in 1966 and 1967, on which he had become a regular. She had three children, Bryan, Jayme and Patrick. Greer died in 2001, following a long bout with Alzheimer's.  References  *N.Y.

M. aquatica is related to the living species M. arborescens and M. linifera. The species is solely known from the Middle to Late Paleocene (about 60 to 58 Ma), fossil-rich Cerrej√≥n Formation in La Guajira, northern Colombia.Cerrej√≥n 0322 at Fossilworks.org  History and classification  The species is known only from the holotype specimen, number ING-0904, and the four paratypes ING-0808, ING-0903, ING-0905 and ING-0906. The leaves are currently residing in the collections housed by the Colombian Geological Institute in Bogot√°. All five fossil specimens were collected from Cerrej√≥n Formation exposures in the Cerrej√≥n coal mine, located in the Rancheria Basin, Colombia. They were first studied by a group of researchers from Florida Museum of Natural History, the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and led by Fabiany Herrera from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. Herrera and associates published their 2008 type description in the American Journal of Botany. The specific epithet \\"aquatica\\", a derivation of the Latin \\"aquaticus\\", was chosen by the authors in reference to the species having lived near to, or in water.  Description  There are two angiosperm families, Nymphaeaceae and Nelumbonaceae which have leaf shapes very similar to Montrichardia aquatica. Though the overall shape of leaves in those families may be similar the vein structure in M. aquatica is notably distinct from both. Neither family possesses the collective veins along the margin, naked secondary veins along the basal margin, and the distinct higher vein structure that is present in the fossil specimens of M. aquatica. This combination of features is found within the family Araceae. M. aquatica is placed within the living Araceae genus Montrichardia due to the unique combination of leaf morphology characters present in the fossils. Though the fossils are generally similar to the fossil genus Caladiosoma the vein structure is very dissimilar and thus is not considered a close relation. Overall, the species possesses entire margined leaves with a generally ovate shape. The leaf apex is short and rounded, while the base is heart to arrowhead shaped. Each of the basal lobes is supplied by a secondary vein which forms part of the margin and forks several times. The overall size of the leaves reached up to . Several depositional environments, at an estimated paleolatitude of 5 degrees North, appeared to have hosted M. aquatica. The holotype specimen was recovered from a sandstone that probably was an overbank deposits of a fluvial environment. The paratype specimens were recovered from gray siltstones underlying one of the thickest coal sequences in the Cerrej√≥n Formation. These layers are most likely from a swampy to lake like environment.

The following year, he was recalled by Sheng, branded a \\"trotskyite\\" and imprisoned until 1944. While in prison, Burhan wrote a Uyghur-Chinese- Russian Dictionary and translated Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles into Uyghur. He was released by Wu Zhongxin, the Chinese Nationalist official who replaced Sheng Shicai. In 1946, Burhan became the vice-chairman of a provincial coalition government formed between the Chinese Nationalists and the revolutionaries who had founded the Second East Turkestan Republic (Second ETR) in the \\"Three Districts\\".Benson 1990: 63, 70 He was considered a political moderate between the Nationalist Chinese and Second ETR members of the coalition.Benson 1990: 63 In 1947, Burhan was transferred to Nanjing and became an official in the central government under Chiang Kai-shek. Later that year, he led a Xinjiang performance troupe to Taiwan and toured Keelung, Taipei, Taichung, and Kaoshiung. The tour came shortly after the February 28 Incident, which left many islanders hostile to mainlanders. Burhan gave speeches that appealed to national unity. In 1948, he returned to Xinjiang and became the president of the Xinjiang Academy, the precursor to the Xinjiang University. He favored Chinese nationalism and disagreed with Turkic nationalist positions of Muhammad Amin Bughra.

The Basilica di Sant'Andrea is the church of a monastery in Vercelli, Piedmont, northern Italy, founded in 1219 by Cardinal Guala Bicchieri and completed in 1227. It represents an early example of Gothic architecture in Italy, inspired by Cistercian models and featuring Romanesque elements as well. History The basilica was built between 1219 and 1227 at the direction of Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, who had just returned from England where he had been papal legate. Bicchieri had received from King Henry III the perpetual rights to the income of Saint Andrew's Church in Chesterton, Cambridge. Thanks to this financial support, the cardinal was able to call to Vercelli some Augustinian canons from Saint-Victor in Paris, giving them responsibility over the new abbey and the hospital to be built for the pilgrims who travelled the Via Francigena. The hospital was begun in 1224. Although the architect is unknown, it is presumed that the Gothic lines of the new edifice were introduced by the French clerics, who included abbot Thomas Gallus, previously a professor in the University of Paris. According to Italian art historian Giulio Carlo Argan, the architect could have been Benedetto Antelami. The style of the Romanesque elements connects the building to the architectural traditions of northern Italy and suggest the hand of an Italian master in the design. Thanks to Bicchieri's diplomacy, the abbey was able to increase its possessions through donations and privileges from pope Honorius III and emperor Frederick II.S. Baiocco et al Bicchieri died in Rome in 1227, the year in which the basilica was finished. View of the cloister. Interior. In the early 15th century a new bell tower was built, in a detached position, on the right side of the church. In the following century the cloister of the monastery was rebuilt, though the original small columns - in groups of four - were kept. The complex was damaged during the Siege of Vercelli of 1617. During restorations carried out in 1818-1840, the scrinium (travelling case) of Guala Bicchieri was found in the building; it is now in the Civic Museum of Ancient Art in Turin. Other restorations took place in 1927 and 1955-1960. Description The basilica is built on the Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles of six bays each. The aisles are lower than the nave. The right aisle has buttresses from which flying buttresses (an element typical of Gothic architecture) connect it to the nave. The transept, of five bays, has the same width and height of the nave. At the crossing is a tall octagonal lantern tower, surmounted by a belfry, also octagonal, which ends with a pyramidal cusp in brickwork. The apse has a rectangular plan, a typical feature of Cistercian Gothic edifices. Lunette with the \\"Martyrdom of St. Andrew\\". The fa√ßade features stones of different types: green stone from Pralungo, calcarenite from Montferrat and serpentine from Oria. The stone is combined with the red brickwork and white cotto of the upper part of the two side bell towers. The wide gable of the central section, the two blind arcades and the big rose window in the middle are all elements in the tradition of Lombard-Emilian Romanesque architecture. The entrance is through three portals, also in Romanesque style, with four orders of small double columns. The lunette of the central portal has a relief depicting the \\"Martyrdom of St. Andrew\\", while that of the left portal shows \\"Cardinal Bicchieri offering the Church to St. Andrew, enthroned\\". Benedetto Antelami has been suggested as the author of the two sculptures, although it is more likely that they were executed by one or more of his pupils who had worked in the Baptistery of Parma.G. Vergani, p. 400 The interior of the basilica is fully Gothic in style, with ogival arcades supported by piers formed by a cylindrical element surrounded by eight small columns. The ceiling has quadripartite vaults. The crossing tower is supported on four pendentives which are decorated with small columns over corbels; these reach other corbels in the lantern tower where are sculptures (from Antelami's school) representing symbols of the Four Evangelists. Beyond the crossing is the chancel, with the presbytery and the rectangular choir, which is illuminated by a large rose window and three mullioned windows, and has wooden seats from the early 16th century. Artworks include the funerary monument of abbot Thomas Gallus (early 14th century), with a fresco of Lombard school. In the first chapel in the left arm of the transept is a 15th-century painted crucifix. See also References Sources * S. Baiocco, S. Castronovo, E. Pagella, Arte in Piemonte.

In 1163 as the brother-in-law of the late count, Siegfried IV of Boyneburg, who had died in 1144, he brought certain claims against Northeim Abbey, mediated by his wife, Richenza, before Henry the Lion, who had to uphold them. Henry the Lion later purchased the rights to this abbey from his sons.

A garment known as the trabea triumphalis was commonly worn by consuls in Late Antiquity. When Emperor Justinian II abolished the office of 'consul as a separate entity from the Emperor himself, the trabea triumphalis developed into the loros, which was the worn only by the imperial family and senior administrative officials.

A North Korean troop transport carrying hundreds of soldiers attempted to land its cargo near Busan but was encountered by a South Korean patrol ship and sunk. It was one of the first surface actions of the war and resulted in an important South Korean victory. Battle Baekdusan (PC-701) with South Korean flag painting on the side of the ship The Korean War began on 25 June 1950 with a massive North Korean invasion of South Korea which nearly overran the country. During the invasion, a North Korean steamer was assigned to insert troops along the peninsula's southeastern coast. The merchant ship of 1,000 tons was armed with machine guns and loaded with 600 soldiers of the 766th Independent Infantry Regiment. It was early morning when the Republic of Korea Navy submarine chaser ROKS Bak Du San spotted the lone enemy steamer eighteen miles from Busan. The chaser, also formerly American, was the lead vessel of the South Korean Navy. Bak Du San first challenged the steamer with signal lights and received no response. But when the South Koreans turned on their searchlights, the North Koreans opened fire, hitting the Bak Du Sans bridge. The helmsman was killed and the officer of the deck seriously wounded. Bak Du San returned fire with her main 3-inch anti-aircraft gun and six .50-caliber machine guns. After the North Koreans began taking hits, they attempted to flee the engagement, but were chased by the Bak Du San in a running battle that ended with the steamer being sunk near Tsushima Island, with heavy loss of life. The victory was a major strategic gain. Busan was vital but only lightly defended, and if it had fallen the North Koreans would have been one step closer to completely overrunning the country.

Early life Eleanor Dorothy Stopford was born on 9 September 1890 at Newstead, Clonskeagh, County Dublin, to Jemmett Stopford, a civil servant, and Constance Kennedy. Jemmett Stopford was descended from a long line of Church of Ireland clerics.O'Broin, Leon, Protestant Nationalists in Revolutionary Ireland: the Stopford Connection. Dublin, Gill & MacMillan, 1985 Constance Kennedy, also a Protestant, was the daughter of Dr Evory Kennedy, a master of the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, from 1833‚Äì40.Browne, O'Donel T.D. The Rotunda Hospital 1745‚Äì1945, Edinburgh: E&S; Livingstone, 1947. Her aunt was Irish nationalist historian Alice Stopford Green. The Stopfords had four children: Alice, Edie, Dorothy and Robert. The births of the children are registered at different addresses in south Dublin. In 1887 they were living at Roebuck Lodge, Dundrum, in 1890 at Newstead, Clonskeagh, and in 1895 at 28 Highfield Road, Rathgar. Jemmett Stopford died from typhoid fever in 1902, and the medical costs incurred in his illness left the family so badly off that Constance Kennedy had to sell the family home of Wyvern in Bushy Park Road in Terenure, Rathfarnham. The family relocated to 65 Campden Gardens, West Kensington, London.O'Broin, Leon, Protestant Nationalists in Revolutionary Ireland: the Stopford Connection. Dublin, Gill & MacMillan, 1985. She lived through two World Wars, the Spanish Influenza pandemic, the 1916 Rising in Ireland, and the foundation of a new Irish state.MacLellan, Anne. Dorothy Stopford Price: Rebel Doctor. Dublin, Irish Academic Press, 2014. She was brought up as a child of the British Empire, living first in Dublin and later in London. She spent Easter 1916 as a guest of Sir Matthew Nathan, the British Under-Secretary. While residing there, she had a unique view of the Easter Rising as seen by the British administration in Ireland. Her Easter 1916 diary is in the Irish National Library, Dublin. After the Rising, she began to question her political allegiances and embraced Irish nationalism. Education Dorothy first began her education by working with the Charitable Organisation Society, where she studied a form of social science. She also passed an examination to study Art, Design and Ornamentation in the Regent Street Polytechnic. She sat a further exam which gave her the opportunity to enter the Royal College of Art, but did not do so. She ultimately decided to study medicine at age 25, and was a medical student in Trinity College Dublin from 1916 to 1921. She graduated with a BA in 1920, BAO (Bachelor in Midwifery), BCh (Bachelor in Surgery) and MB in 1921. As part of her training she worked in the Meath Hospital, Dublin, as a clinical clerk. In 1918-19, she witnessed the Spanish flu at first hand. She tended to victims during the day and cycled to the mortuary at night to carry out post mortems.Price, Liam. Dorothy Price: An Account of Twenty Years' Fight against Tuberculosis in Ireland, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1957, for private circulation only. Career After she qualified as a doctor, Dorothy's first job was as a dispensary doctor in Kilbrittain in County Cork, where she also engaged in the Irish War of Independence, tending to injured members of the Irish Republican Army. During the ensuing Irish Civil War, she favoured the Republican side. Dorothy joined Cumann na mBan, the IRA's Auxiliary, and gave lectures on first aid as part of her involvement. Her biggest career achievements were through her involvements with tuberculosis. She was first exposed to the disease when John Richard Green, husband of her aunt, Alice Stopford Green, died from the condition. She also attended a Tuberculosis Day in Walworth at the invitation of Mrs Anstruther, a social worker friend of her aunt. In 1923, she returned to Dublin and began work in Saint Ultan's Children's Hospital, Dublin as a visiting physician.OhOgartaigh, Margaret. \\"Dorothy Stopford Price and the Elimination of Childhood Tuberculosis\\", in OhOgartaigh, Margaret (ed.), Quiet Revolutionaries, Irish Women in Education, Sport and Medicine, 1861‚Äì1964, Dublin: History Press Ireland, 2011. This was an honorary, unpaid position. Dorothy began to research and write about tuberculosis, particularly in the context of children. After a 1931 visit to Vienna, she began to use the tuberculin test to diagnose tuberculosis.MacLellan, Anne. \\"The Penny Test: Tuberculin Testing and Paediatric Practice in Ireland, 1900‚Äì1960\\", in MacLellan, Anne and Mauger, Alice (eds.), Growing Pains: Childhood Illness in Ireland, 1750‚Äì1950. Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 2013. She was interested in the controversial BCG vaccine which could protect against tuberculosis. Her work with tuberculin had shown that many Irish adolescents from rural areas were tuberculin negative and vulnerable to contracting tuberculosis. She was anxious that Irish emigrants, including young Irish nurses and nurse trainees, be vaccinated.MacLellan, Anne, \\"Victim or Vector: Tubercular Irish Nurses in England 1930‚Äì1960\\", in Cox, Catherine and Marland, Hilary (eds.), Migration, Health and Ethnicity in the Modern World, Houndsmills, Palgrave Macmillan, 2013. In 1949, Price was appointed as the first chairperson of the Irish National BCG Committee. She learned German while working at St Ultan's to translate and read German literature on TB. She took a post-graduate course in Scheidess before preparing a thesis on The Diagnosis of Primary Tuberculosis in Children, which described modern continental theories and practices, and won her an MD. She began writing her book Tuberculosis in Childhood in 1937 and had 1000 copies of it produced by a Bristol-based publisher in 1939. She became a member for the Red Cross Anti-TB committee, but later resigned for political reasons. She was recognised for her work when Health Minister Noel Browne appointed her as Chairman of a Consultative Council on TB. They eventually managed to open a BCG vaccination unit in St Ultan‚Äôs Hospital. Her research and publications, her work on voluntary national committees and her continuous highlighting of the problem of tuberculosis in Ireland as well as her efforts to introduce tuberculin testing and BCG vaccination were pivotal in the ending of the Irish tuberculosis epidemic in the mid-20th century. Personal life Stopford married William George \\"Liam\\" Price, a barrister, district justice and local historian from Wicklow. They became engaged in 1924, surprising many as Stopford was a republican (anti-Treaty) while Price was a Free State supporter (pro-Treaty). They wed on 8 January 1925 in St Ann's Church, Dawson Street. They first took up residence in Fitzwilliam Place. Dorothy Price discovered she was unable to have children in 1926. Liam Price later compiled an account of his wife's fight against TB by 1955. Death She suffered a stroke in January 1950, which led to her relocating to 1 Herbert Park, Ballsbridge. She died on 30 January 1954, aged 63, after suffering another stroke. She was buried in St Maelruen's graveyard in Tallaght. Legacy Medical professor Victor Millington Synge stated that \\"To her, more than anyone else, is due the credit of introducing into Ireland modern ideas of, and preventive measures against tuberculosis. Few of the many thousands of children and young people who have been saved from death or tedious illness by BCG realize what they owe to Dorothy Price.\\" Her professional archives are in the Library of Trinity College Dublin.

It was described in 2010 on the basis of a single fossil from Oklahoma. The single species, Aciculopoda mapesi, was named by Rodney Feldmann and Carrie Schweitzer in honour of Royal Mapes, a paleontologist who discovered the type specimen. It is only the third unambiguous fossil decapod from before the Mesozoic. Discovery The fossil was discovered in the Woodford Shale, exposed at the Ryan Quarry, in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma. The Woodford Shale is a dark-colored siliceous shale which outcrops to the north- east and the south-west of the Arbuckle Mountains in Oklahoma. It contains \\"radiolarians, conodonts, sponge spicules, ammonoid and nautiloid cephalopods, inarticulate brachiopods [...] and small phyllocarid arthropods\\", and spans the Devonian‚ÄìCarboniferous boundary. The strata which produced Aciculopoda are thought on the basis of conodont biostratigraphy to be from the Famennian. Description The holotype of Aciculopoda mapesi is housed at the United States National Museum as lot USNM 540766. The animal is long, of which the anterior is the cephalothorax. The pleon (abdomen) is around long, along its curved dorsal margin, and about deep at its base. The cuticle is missing from the pleon, exposing the well-preserved muscles beneath. Etymology The genus name Aciculopoda is said to be derived from the Latin ' (\\"needle\\") and \\"'\\" (\\"foot\\"), referring to the sharp spines on the pereiopods. Pes is however used for \\"foot\\" in classical and botanical Latin,.Lewis, C.T. & Short, C. (1879). A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary.

Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie.Oxford: Clarendon Press. The specific epithet commemorates Royal Mapes, who discovered the specimen and has published widely on fossil crustaceans. Interpretation The only unambiguous decapod fossil older than Aciculopoda is Palaeopalaemon newberryi, found in Devonian sediments in Ohio. (The assignment of Imocaris to the Decapoda is the subject of some debate.) The fact that both Aciculopoda and Palaeopalaemon were discovered in the United States led Feldmann & Schweitzer to suggest that their common ancestor, the most recent common ancestor of the Decapoda may also have originated in the ancient continent Laurentia.

Nevertheless, the Strathcona Library does have a complex background as to its historical status within the Edmonton Public Library system. It is located on 104th Street, a block off of Whyte Avenue in the heart of Old Strathcona. Situated next to Wilbert McIntyre Park, the iconic Old Strathcona Gazebo, and the year- round Old Strathcona Farmer's Market, the Old Strathcona Branch is often a central gathering area for much of the local community. During the annual Edmonton International Fringe Festival in the surrounding area, the Old Strathcona Branch often hosts a large booksale to help shift aging and excess material from Edmonton Public Library's circulation. History The American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie had his offer rejected by the library's board In 1897, the Strathcona Library Society was formed, with the idea to build a public library in the young city of Strathcona. In 1910, a petition from citizens was eventually presented to the city council, officially requesting the construction of the library. The city quickly bought up the land for $6,250 from a local farmer, and organized the Strathcona Library Board. The American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie eventually offered the city $15,000 to build a small, standardized library. However, the board did not feel this would provide the library they were hoping to build, and they declined Carnegie's offer. Costs for the new library were eventually paid for as part of the agreement when Strathcona and Edmonton amalgamated in 1912. Construction began in 1912, and the new library was opened on March 13, 1913 by ex-Strathcona Mayor John Joseph Duggan and Edmonton Mayor William Short. Final cost of the library was approximately $27,000. The library was popular upon opening, and boasted an impressive circulation for the size of Edmonton at the time. The first minor renovation was completed in 1948, which converted the original men's-only reading room in the basement into a children's library. The post-WWII years, however, saw a sharp decline in usage as Edmonton rapidly expanded outward in the post-war boom, and Old Strathcona began to fall into disrepair and decline. The completion of the much larger and more modern Stanley A. Milner central library downtown in 1967 further perpetuated this decline. By the late 1960s, the aging and poorly maintained building began to require significant upkeep costs. The director of Edmonton Public Library attempted to close the branch in 1970. Although the closure was defeated by public opposition, the structural decline of the building meant the second floor could no longer support the weight of books, and the branch's collection and hours of operation were severely cut. The early 1970s, however, saw a resurgence of support for the Old Strathcona Branch. Proposed south-side to downtown freeways threatened to destroy the remaining historic elements of Old Strathcona around Whyte Avenue. This led to a new interest in historic preservation and restoration, and the rebirth of Old Strathcona as a trendy arts and nightlife district. This resurgence brought great support for the library, and in 1976 the building was declared a Registered Historic Resource of Alberta by the provincial Minister of Culture. From 1984 to 1985 the library received a $250,000 restoration, undertaken by R.R. Roberts Architects, and paid for by the sale of the original downtown library building in the late 1960s when it was demolished to build the Alberta Government Telephones towers (today ATB Place). Since the mid-1980s, the branch has again become one of Edmonton Public Library's busiest, and is often seen as a community focal point for Old Strathcona. In 2004, the City of Edmonton named the building a Municipal Historic Resource, and from 2005 to 2006 the library was closed for another extensive restoration and expansion. This expansion added a large semi-circular addition, modern facilities to provide handicap accessibility, modern and efficient mechanical systems, and nearly doubled the library's original size. The renovation, however, was careful to maintain the building's original historical elements. The Old Strathcona branch of the Edmonton Public Library as well as the overall Edmonton Public Library system of branches is celebrating a milestone of 100 years in 2013. Edmonton Public Library 100 years. www.epl.ca/100 The library system now has 3 million physical and digital items in its vast collection as well as 12,000 free events each year.Edmonton public Library Architecture The original building was designed by the firm of Arthur G. Wilson and David E. Herrald. Although a local duo, their design borrowed heavily from their British roots. It is a simplified English Renaissance Revival Style, common for commonwealth buildings of the Edwardian age. Although grand in appearance, with ionic columns and limestone cornices on the exterior and intricate carved wood on the interior, the design is far more simplified and streamlined than earlier buildings of the Victoria era. This is reflected in other nearby buildings of the same age, such as Old Scona Academic High School. Schools served As part of Edmonton Public Library's regional division, the Old Strathcona branch serves the following nearby schools: *Academy at King Edward *Belgravia Elementary School *√âcole Joseph-Moreau *Garneau Elementary School *J.H. Picard Elementary/Junior/High School *King Edward Elementary School *McKernan Elementary/Junior High School *Mill Creek Elementary School *Old Scona Academic High School *Our Lady of Mount Carmel *Queen Alexandra Elementary School *Strathcona Composite High School *Windsor Park Elementary School The Old Strathcona Branch is also, physically, the closest branch of Edmonton Public Library to the University of Alberta (though a fast, direct LRT connection from the university to the downtown central Stanley A. Milner Library somewhat limits its use by students).

The two pieces which make up the opus were first performed at the Royal Orchestra Soir√©e in Copenhagen on 16 March 1891. The oboist was Olivo Krause (to whom they are dedicated) and the pianist Victor Bendix. Background In her list of Nielsen's compositions, Emilie Demant Hatt notes that the first fantasy piece, \\"Andante\\" (later \\"Romance\\") was completed on 30 November 1889, and that \\"Intermezzo\\", was finished on 9 March 1890. From the same source, it appears that the Romance was originally intended to be for oboe and organ. In the summer of 1890, Nielsen had sent his manuscript to Orla Rosenhoff who had instructed him at the Conservatory. Rosenhoff responded: \\"Here and there a little adjustment has been made in the piano part; you will easily discover what I refer to, but could with the same ease restore the original if you do not agree with me about the changes.\\"Lisbeth Ahlgren Jensen, \\"Fantasy Pieces for Oboe and Piano, Opus 2\\", Chamber Music 2, Carl Nielsen Edition , Royal Danish Library. Changes were indeed made to the piano part. Nielsen, who was in Dresden on a grant when he read the proofs in the autumn of 1890, commented in his diary entry for 18 September: \\"Have spent the day reading proofs of my oboe pieces. At one place in the second piece some A‚Äôs had to be deleted, so now it says a bort, a bort (A away, A away). The joke that I have aborted my own brainchild suggests itself rather strongly.\\" Just four days later, Nielsen explains that he and the pianist Victor Bendix played the fantasy pieces at a social gathering in Dresden: \\"First we played Bendix‚Äôs trio (I played the violin). Beautiful piece of music! Then B. and I played my two oboe pieces. This was in reality the greatest triumph I have had so far.\\" Nielsen no doubt played the oboe part on the violin. Reception The first public performance of the fantasy pieces was at the Royal Orchestra Soir√©e on 16 March 1891. The oboist was Olivo Krause and the pianist Victor Bendix. Aftenbladet was enthusiastic: \\"As for new pieces, what was on offer last night was Carl Nielsen‚Äôs Fantasy Pieces for Oboe and Piano. In this the young, talented composer has revealed no mean knowledge of the peculiarities of the oboe as well as great technical skill in the structure of the composition. It is not ordinary, hackneyed motifs that Mr Carl Nielsen uses; calmly and steadily he goes his own way. For that reason one can safely pin great hopes on the future of the young artist. Mr Olivo Krause performed the not entirely easy oboe part with a full, beautiful tone, and Mr Victor Bendix played the piano part tastefully and finely.\\" Politiken also praised the young composer's \\"decided compositional talent\\" while Berlingske Tidende highlighted Nielsen's \\"close knowledge of the peculiarities of the oboe as a solo instrument\\" and mentioned \\"the lively applause\\" at the end. The pieces were performed on several other occasions during Nielsen's lifetime. Hans Sitt's transcriptions of the Romance for violin and orchestra and for violin and piano were also popular. On at least one occasion Nielsen appeared as the violinist and in 1926 he conducted the orchestral work in Aarhus, Silkeborg and Odense. Music In a programme note written at least 20 years after he composed the oboe piece, Nielsen offered the following short description: \\"The two oboe pieces are a very early opus. The first ‚Äî slow ‚Äî piece gives the oboe the opportunity to sing out its notes quite as beautifully as this instrument can. The second is more humorous, roguish, with an undertone of Nordic nature and forest rustlings in the moonlight.\\" References Category:Compositions by Carl Nielsen Category:Chamber music compositions Category:1890 compositions Category:Instrumental duets Category:Compositions for oboe and piano ","title":"Fantasy Pieces for Oboe and Piano"},{"id":"29581402","text":"Strokestown Park House is a Palladian villa in Strokestown, County Roscommon, Ireland, set on about .

By the early 18th century, the estate comprised over , scattered throughout north east Roscommon, put together from the later seventeenth century as a result of land acquisitions by Captain Nicholas Mahon around 1660. Later, his great-grandson, Maurice Mahon, purchased several additional lands, following elevation to the Peerage of Ireland as the first Baron Hartland in 1800. Many evictions of poor tenant farmers occurred during the Great Famine.

She was on honeymoon at the time, having been married only weeks earlier, to Henry Sandford Pakenham, son of Dean Henry Pakenham of Tullynally, and heir to the vast Pakenham and Sandford estates in counties Longford, Westmeath and Roscommon. Grace Catherine never returned to Strokestown, but her marriage undoubtedly saved the estate from bankruptcy. On the eve of the Famine, the estate was in debt with over ¬£30,000 having accrued as a result of family dispute over inheritancehttp://www.rte.ie/radio/utils/radioplayer/rteradioweb.html#!rii=9%3A10423868%3A0%3A%3A and expensive land purchases which had gathered from the second half of the eighteenth century.History Ireland, Volume 3, Issue 4. The marriage alliance (by which Henry Sandford Pakenham assumed the additional surname of Mahon), united the estates of both families to comprise over 26,000 acres, and the Strokestown estate remained one of the largest in Roscommon until his death in 1893. The Pakenham fortune also enabled large scale investment in various estate improvement projects on the Strokestown estate, including drainage, turf cutting and agricultural schemes, development of the urban market in the town of Strokestown. However, despite the family fortunes improving Strokestown continued a policy of forced emigration to the United States and land clearances of tenant families. Since 1979, Strokestown Park has been owned by a Roscommon-based company, the Westward Group which has restored the house and gardens using largely original furnishings. The walled pleasure garden was officially opened in 1997 by the President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, having been faithfully restored with the assistance of an ERDF grant through the Great Gardens of Ireland Restoration Programme and a F√ÅS scheme.

On 9 August 1940 (still with Olsen as editor) it stopped entirely because of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. In 1949, during the legal purge in Norway after World War II, Olsen was convicted of treason for having printed \\"un-national\\" material in six articles in May and June 1940 prior to the closing of Arbeidet. She started writing books, and first authored four books mostly about local trade unions: Femti √•r p√• sporet : Bergens sporvei 1897‚Äì1947, Sporveisreparat√∏renes forening, Bergen 30 √•r, Malersvennenes forening, Bergen 65 √•r 1884‚Äì1949 and Malersvennenes forening: 75 √•rs beretning 1884‚Äì1959. She then wrote novels and young adult fiction, including Tine (1961, translated to Russian in 1963 and German in 1967), L√∏sgjengeren (1963, translated to English as Stray Dog in 1966), Den hvite wampumen (1967), Pr√¶riekyllingen danser (1968) and Vesle-kari blir voksen (1969, translated to Icelandic in 1973).List of publications in BIBSYS She was married to (1899‚Äì1977), mayor in Laksev√•g.

It was first released in 1987. As one of Jennings' darker collections, death is a theme in many of the stories ‚Äì most significantly Unhappily Ever After (which serves as an allegory for hell), and A Dozen Bloomin' Roses and No Is Yes (which have ambiguous implications of suicide and murder respectively), as such has the fewest stories (of any pre-1993 release) adapted for Round the Twist. The stories =Sneeze'n Coffin= A girl's mother remarries an undertaker, which embarrasses the girl because he always drives in his hearse, and also because he tells her younger brother that his coffins are boats. As a result, the girl's younger brother launches the coffin into the water, thinking it is a boat and ending up disgracing the family, but the undertaker doesn't even care, which also messes up the girl's life. When the undertaker brings a corpse home from work and the girl gets locked in a room with the corpse, the story gets interesting. =Santa Claws= A boy visits a hypnotist on Christmas Day because he somehow gets a small mouth that is the size of a marble. The boy explains through writing that while taking his younger brother Christmas shopping, they encountered a Santa Claus that had claws for fingernails and gave them, as well as their older sister, two wishes. Was later adapted as an episode of Round The Twist. =A Dozen Bloomin' Roses= The story follows the narrator's encounter with a boy, Gerald, who purchases a bouquet of a dozen roses for a girl. After a series of embarrassing accidents including spending most of his grandmother's pension, destroying the flowers on the train and being publicly humiliated by a local skinhead called Scouse, Gerald runs down a train tunnel and is killed by an oncoming train. As the narrator struggles to cope with Gerald's death, 12 roses appear from their hand, a gift from Gerald from beyond the grave. Afterwards when the narrator has a violent altercation on a train with Scouse, the train suddenly becomes completely filled with roses which result in the death of the skinhead, saving the narrator's life. At the conclusion, it is revealed that the narrator, Samantha, was the girl Gerald had bought the flowers. =Tonsil Eye 'Tis= A boy who is obsessed with garden gnomes gets a gnome with a face in its mouth. After getting the face out of the gnome's mouth, the boy ends up getting the face in his own mouth, as well as an eye growing on his finger. =Unhappily Ever After= A principal who enjoys giving the strap to troublemakers, as well as people who insult him, goes for a boat ride, but when he gets trapped in a current, he is forced to watch images of people doing to others what those others do to them. =Spooks Incorporated= Two boys enjoy pretending to be ghosts and haunting houses so that their owners will sell them. But when they create a mechanical headless chicken to scare off the owner of a local Melbourne pub, they find out that the pub really is haunted - by the real headless chicken. =The Copy= A boy who has a doctor for a friend visits the doctor every day to see his inventions. The doctor's latest invention is a machine that can copy people. The boy ends up copying himself so he can take down a bully, but his copy ends up stealing his tea, his girlfriend, and finally his life. Was later loosely adapted as an episode of Round The Twist. =Stuffed= A young man works by clearing cane toads from peoples' yards and releasing them in a swamp - despite the cane toad's status as an invasive species in Australia, he actually loves toads and ends up having two of them for pets. Frisbee, a man who lives near him sells souvenirs, but he ends up becoming a toad clearer himself. But he is different - he enjoys killing the toads and stuffing them for his new line of souvenirs. Will Martin be able to stop Frisbee from killing them? =No Is Yes= A man has kept his 14-year-old daughter Linda locked up in his house for her entire life; he is the only person with whom she has interacted, and he has deliberately communicated with her in 'mixed-up English', using words in opposite contexts (such as interchanging the words 'yes' and 'no') to demonstrate a point about the way a person learns to speak. A young plumber visits and is horrified, and the father gives him permission to attempt to explain the experiment to Linda, convinced that she will not be able to comprehend what he is telling her; he tries several times, and as the story progresses she shows signs of beginning to understand what her father has done. At the climax of the story, the house burns down with Linda's father trapped inside. When the fireman asks Linda if anyone is inside the house, she tells him 'no'; but, her meaning is left ambiguous. This story was meant for young adults.

Flying the Avia S-199, Alon participated in the IAF's first combat sortie on 29 May 1948, and on 3 June scored the IAF's very first aerial victories, downing a pair of Royal Egyptian Air Force C-47s over Tel Aviv. Biography Mordechai Alon was born in Safed on 17 January 1921, to Yaacov and Naomi Kalibansky, pioneers of the Second Aliyah. The family moved around several times before finally settling in Tel Aviv, where Alon attended the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium while secretly enlisting in the Haganah. After graduating Alon went off to serve in Kibbutz Degania Alef and in 1938 was among the founding members of Hanita. =RAF service= In 1940 Alon enlisted in the Royal Air Force, heeding calls by the Jewish Agency for the Jews of Palestine to support the British war effort. Denied the chance to train as a fighter pilot, in November 1940 Alon attended the RAF's Wireless Operators course in Ismailia, qualifying as a Ground Wireless Operator. Persisting in RAF service, in August 1943 Alon was finally allowed to undertake RAF flight training. He began his training in Rhodesia on 24 November 1943, graduating on 22 December 1944. After several postings in Cairo and Italy, in August 1945 Alon was posted to an RAF squadron flying P-51 Mustangs out of RAF Ramat David. Growing tensions between British mandatory authorities and the Yeshuv, however, prompted the RAF to transfer Alon once again. Torn between conflicting loyalties, Alon shortly thereafter quit the RAF. On 31 January 1946, he returned to Palestine, where he enrolled at the Technion, studying architecture. =Sherut Avir and birth of the Israeli Air Force= Modi Alon with fellow pilots; Syd Cohen, Giddy Lichtman, Ezer Weizman, and Arine Ruch in 1948. Avia S-199 at the Israeli Air Force Museum in Hatzerim With the adoption of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in November 1947, fighting erupted and Alon discontinued his studies. He enlisted with the Sherut Avir, the Haganah's nascent air service operating a collection of light aircraft, and in March 1948 was assigned command of its Tel Aviv Squadron. Sherut Avir pilots were employed flying reconnaissance missions, supplied besieged and isolated settlements, escorted convoys and even occasionally participated in fighting. On 27‚Äì28 March Alon flew a number of bombing sorties in support of the beleaguered Nebi Daniel Convoy which had attempted to break the siege of Gush Etzion and was under attack by Arab irregulars. He also served as a liaison officer between the Sherut Avir and Jewish ground forces during April's Operation Nachshon, aimed at breaking the siege of Jerusalem. With the end of the British Mandate for Palestine fast approaching, the Yeshuv sought to bolster its capabilities for the inevitable clash with Israel's Arab neighbors and their regular armies. It therefore secured the purchase of 25 Avia S-199s, a Czechoslovak derivative of the German Messerschmitt Bf 109. Alon was in the first batch of Sherut Avir pilots sent to fly the new aircraft, and departed Sde Dov on 6 May 1948. He was soon flying the Avia at the Czechoslovak airfield at ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. On 15 May, however, Israel declared its independence and found itself under immediate attack, including aerial strikes undertaken by the relatively powerful Royal Egyptian Air Force. Although they had not undergone any sort of gunnery training on the new aircraft, the pilots demanded to return home. On 20 May, therefore, Alon and fellow pilots boarded a Douglas C-54B for the return flight to Israel. On 29 May the fledgling Israeli Air Force officially formed 101 Squadron, its first fighter squadron. Modi Alon was given command of the squadron, although Lou Lenart, a World War II veteran of fighting in the Pacific, was to command it in the air. The squadron had received its first Avia on the night of 20‚Äì21 May 1948, and by 29 May, four aircraft had been secretly assembled in a hangar at Ekron. The IAF had intended to reveal the Israeli acquisition of fighter aircraft with an attack on the Egyptian air base at El Arish, but the desperate situation on the southern front, with an Egyptian column heading towards Tel Aviv, prompted a change of plans. Without their engines having been run before or their guns fired, Lenart, Alon, Ezer Weizman and Eddie Cohen took off late in the afternoon to attack Egyptian forces near Isdud, only about 10 miles away. Each dropped two bombs and strafed the enemy column. The aircraft inflicted only slight damage, losing one Avia S-199 and pilot (Cohen) to ground fire. Alon's aircraft was also damaged upon landing, but the sortie nevertheless bought Israeli forces enough time to halt the Egyptian advance. =First kills= Modi Alon's Avia S-199 pursuing an Egyptian Dakota over Tel Aviv, 3 June 1948 Only one Avia S-199 (probably D-106Yofe and Nyveen (2007), p. 94) was serviceable on 3 June 1948, when a pair of Egyptian C-47s and their two Spitfire escorts returned for their 16th bombing of Tel Aviv. Dozens of civilians had been killed in previous raids, and flying the IAF's sole combat aircraft, Alon engaged the four Egyptian aircraft. Swinging out to sea to get the sun behind him, Alon evaded the Spitfires and then pursued and shot down both bombers, scoring the first aerial victories of the Israeli Air Force. The event took place in sight of the astonished populace which was not aware of the existence of an Israeli fighter arm. The air force held a press conference which Alon attended, and its headquarters was subsequently flooded with gifts, flowers and alcohol for the pilot despite the wartime scarcity of such luxuries. Although Tel Aviv would yet witness raids by Egyptian fighter aircraft, no bombers were ever to appear over the city again. Lou Lenart left the squadron in early July, leaving Alon in sole command.Yofe and Nyveen (2007), p. 40 In the early evening of 18 July Alon scored his third victory, when a formation of three Avias returning from a ground attack mission encountered a pair of REAF Spitfire Mk. VCs. Alon maneuvered behind one of the Spitfires to down Wing Commander Said Afifi al-Janzuri. In late September 1948 Alon participated in Operation Velvetta, ferrying Czechoslovak Spitfires to Israel. Alon and fellow pilot Boris Senior burned too much of their fuel during one leg of the flight and were forced to land in Maritsa, Rhodes. The aircraft were impounded but both men released. =Death= At 16:58 on 16 October 1948, Alon and Ezer Weizman took off from Herzliya to attack Egyptian forces operating in the vicinity of Isdud, not far from where both had participated in the squadron's combat debut in May. Returning to base, Alon had trouble lowering the plane's landing gear and consequently began flying violent maneuvers to try and force the wheels to lower. The Avia's engine started streaming white smoke and the aircraft began losing altitude before hitting the ground and bursting into flames, instantly killing Alon. He was survived by his wife, Mina, three months pregnant at the time. Alon's daughter, Michal, would later serve her mandatory IDF service with 101 Squadron. On 25 October, soon after Alon's death, the airfield at St. Jean, home to the IAF Flight Academy, was renamed \\"Camp Alon\\" in his honor. When the academy moved to Kfar Sirkin (former RAF Petah Tiqva) in 1949, so did the name. The Tel Aviv neighborhood of Ramat HaTayasim (, lit. Pilots' Heights), established during the 1950s, was named after three fallen pilots renowned for their defense of the city ‚Äì Modi Alon, Matityahu Sukenik and Aharon David Sprinzak. The latter two were killed on 4 June 1948, attacking an Egyptian flotilla off the Tel Aviv coast while flying a Fairchild Argus. A memorial to the three stands in a local public garden.

The tree has a wide range in the tropics of the south-west Pacific and south-east Asian regions, and a history of traditional use by the peoples of Polynesia and Melanesia. It is the only edible and culturally important member of the genus Inocarpus. Description There is great diversity in the size, form, shape and colour of the Tahitian chestnut, and of its leaves, flowers and fruit. Because of its long history of cultivation and its tendency to become naturalised where introduced, it is likely that, over its wide range, the species contains several originally farmer-selected cultivars that have not been recognised or described. =Size, form and lifespan= The Tahitian chestnut is a medium- sized, evergreen tropical tree. It may grow to 30 m in height, though 20 m is more usual, with a crown diameter of 4‚Äì6 m. Mature tree trunks have a typical diameter at breast height of 300 mm, although some grow to a diameter of 900 mm. The trunks are distinctively buttressed at the base and fluted. The branches are arranged spirally, with secondary branching forming a dense network within the canopy. The bark is rough, flaky and brown, becoming greyer with age. From the buttresses a dense network of lateral roots extends through the topsoil around the tree, which has only a shallow taproot. It has a lifespan of 80‚Äì90 years. =Leaves= The dark green leaves are simple, oblong, alternate, and leathery. They are 160‚Äì390 mm long and 70‚Äì130 mm wide. The petiole is 5 mm long. The apex is pointed and the base lobed, with an entire margin. The veins are opposite and yellow. =Flowers= The fragrant flowers cluster along a short rachis at the ends of the branches and twigs. About 10 mm long, they have five white to cream or pale yellow petals. Trees begin flowering at 3 to 5 years old, with the flowering season usually taking place in November and December, and fruiting in the following January and February, though this varies through the tree's range and from year to year. Fruit =Fruit= The tree starts bearing fruit at about eight years old. The fruits are slightly flattened, irregularly ovoid, rounded or oblong, and flanged at one end. Produced singly or in clusters, they weigh 50‚Äì110 g and are 46‚Äì130 mm long, 34‚Äì120 mm wide, and 40 mm thick. The smooth skin covers a fibrous shell which holds the kernel. As the fruits ripen their colour changes from green to yellow or orange brown. The mature fruits are usually indehiscent. The seed is white and kidney-shaped and is contained within the thin brown, fibrous shell. It is relatively large, weighing 5‚Äì50 g, 20‚Äì70 mm long by 16‚Äì40 mm wide. The seed is toxic when raw but edible when cooked. It is perishable, with a short shelf life. The fleshy mesocarp, or pulp, of the fruit is eaten by cockatoos and flying foxes which act as seed dispersal agents. Distribution and habitat The Tahitian chestnut grows in the humid lowland tropics with a moderate to high, uniformly distributed or mainly summer rainfall of annually, at altitudes ranging from . It grows in a wide range of soils, including those that are highly calcareous and saline, poorly drained to waterlogged, or those with medium to very low fertility, as well as in mildly acidic to very alkaline coastal soils. The tree was evidently cultivated more intensively in the past, as it has become extensively naturalised, and is now found mainly in the wild. Its distribution spreads from Malaysia in the west across Melanesia, north-eastern Australia and Micronesia, to the Marquesas of Polynesia in the east. It is commonly found in secondary forest, along the edges of old gardens, riverbanks, in swamps, coastal areas, coconut plantations and mangroves. Uses The tree has a wide variety of traditional uses, exploiting almost every part of the plant. The leaves and bark have found uses in herbal medicine, in Fiji the leaves also are one of the traditional materials for thatching the bure, fallen branches serve as firewood, green wood is burned to dry copra, and the timber is used for crafts such as carvings and tool handles, as well as for building canoes and for general light construction. The fleshy mesocarp is inedible for humans, but the seed kernels serve as an important indigenous food in many island countries in the Pacific. The kernel has a protein content of about 5% and carbohydrate content of 22%, and needs to be cooked to make it edible. Methods of preparation include roasting, grilling, boiling and baking. In Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and in Polynesia the cooked kernels are often mashed into a pudding. The tree has uses in agroforestry in coastal and soil stabilisation, as an overstorey for crops needing shade, such as cocoa, and as a windbreak. The main products are the edible kernels and the timber. Trees over 25 years old can produce up to 75 kg of fruit a year. Mythology Examples of local folklore about the tree: *It was believed in Samoa that humans originated from the Tahitian chestnut tree. *In Vanuatu the first woman was a man who had been emasculated by having the hot leaves applied to his genitals. *On Choiseul Island in the Solomons, a man who betrayed a tribal chief was suffocated by the flatulence produced as a result of the people around him eating the cooked kernels.

It is normally known as Synagogue Nazareth rather than Synagogue de la rue Nazareth, its official name. View of the interior of the synagogue History In 1810, the Ashkenazi Jews of Paris, had two synagogues, one on rue Sainte-Avoye (today: rue du Temple) and another on rue du Chaulme (today: rue des Archives). Expelled from the synagogue on Saint-Avoye by the landlord in 1818, the community bought a plot of land in 1819 situated between 14 rue Neuve-Saint-Laurent (today: rue du Vertbois) and 15 rue Notre-Dame-de- Nazareth. After having received permission from the King, Louis XVIII through the ordinance of 29 June 1819, the Assembly of the Jews of Paris, construction began under the direction of architect Sandri√© de Jouy, and ended in 1822. The synagogue was built to accommodate a congregation of several hundred worshipers, including galleries for women. The synagogue on rue du Chaume was closed the following year. Very rapidly faults began to emerge in construction, and in 1848, the building was in danger of collapsing. The police closed it in 1850 and it was destroyed. A new synagogue designed by the architect Thierry (1810‚Äì1890) was built on the site funded by donations from Baron James de Rothschild and was inaugurated in 1852. The synagogue contains an organ, quite common among French Jews since Chief Rabbi Salomon Ulmann published a responsa in its favour. The actress Rachel was a member of the congregation. The composer Jacques Offenbach, after having arrived in Paris, was appointed, with his brother, to train and manage the choir \\"de la formation et de la direction du ch≈ìur\\" for six months from December 1833.Jean- Claude Yon, Jacques Offenbach, Gallimard 2000, pages 25 and 28. It followed an Alsacien rite, and was the residence of the Chief Rabbis of France and of Paris until the construction of the Grand Synagogue (on rue de la Victoire) in 1875. The French composer Ernest Cahen played the Cavaill√©-Coll organ of the synagogue. During the Second World War, in 1941 the synagogue was damaged by French collaborators. The chief rabbi of the synagogue, Joseph Saks and his wife were arrested and deported during the Holocaust. Due to the influx of North African Jews from migration, the synagogue changed to follow the Sephardi rite.
