This concept is very important when trying to optimize a synthetic plan. Since every reaction step can decrease the yield of the product, reducing the value of the LLS is a good way to increase the quantity of chemicals formed at the end: this can be done by devising quicker methods to couple the fragments or by introducing convergence. However, improving sequences which are not the longest linear one will generally not produce an overall enhancement to the yield of the reaction since the benefits incur in intermediates that were already present in excess, assuming that the yields for each of the steps are roughly equal.

Its goal is to build sustainable community health systems at scale. Living Goods operates networks of independent entrepreneurs who make a living by selling medicines and products to poor people that can help improve their health, wealth, and productivity. Living Goods borrows from successful direct selling models like Avon Products, Amway and Tupperware. The project aims to be fully self-funded at scale. Living Goods was founded by Chuck Slaughter in 2007. Objectives Living Goods focuses on three prevailing problems with health systems in the developing world: 1) the shortage of front-line health workers, 2) the inadequate distribution of basic health products in both the public and private sectors, and 3) the failure of innovations like clean cook stoves and solar lamps to reach scale. It is largely recognized that each of these problems increases in severity at the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù where the need is greatest. Using a double bottom line business approach, Living Goods aims to: * Reduce child mortality rate by at least 15% * Save 20% of poor families on basic health products and daily necessities * Create incomes for thousands of entrepreneurs * Increase access to innovations * Scale impact via global replication of the Living Goods direct-selling model Operations =Direct Selling System= Living Goods franchises its brand and business model to women who work as independent, self-employed ‚ÄòAvon-like‚Äô agents. The women receive training, a below-market inventory loan, and a ‚ÄòBusiness in a Bag‚Äô including branded uniforms, signs, and basic health and business tools‚Äîincluding a smartphone loaded with Living Goods apps . Living Goods supports agents through networks of branch-warehouses. Agents serve their clients via door-to-door visits, home-based stores, mobile technology and community meetings. Each agent serves approximately 700 people. =Products= The organization focuses on a short list of diseases that account for over two-thirds of child mortality but can be prevented and/or treated at very low cost, including malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infection and neo-natal sepsis. Living Goods also acts as a distribution platform for new pro-poor products designed by smaller companies who face challenges distributing in these markets on their own. Listed below is a sample of the items in Living Goods‚Äô product mix: Pro-Poor Innovations: Solar lanterns, clean cook stoves, slow burning briquettes. Prevention/ Nutrition: Water filters, fortified foods, bed nets, condoms, vitamins, iron, safe delivery kits, family planning. Treatment: Malaria treatments, de-worming pills, diarrhea treatments, basic antibiotics. Fast-Moving Consumer Goods: Diapers, sanitary pads. =Distribution= Living Goods uses their buying power to create a streamlined supply chain. Avoiding fragmented and inefficient supply chains keeps product costs down for customers. Some Living Goods prices are 50% below the prevailing market price. By controlling distribution the organization is able to keep stock levels consistent and avoid the circulation of counterfeit drugs. =Mobile communications= Every Living Goods agent uses a smartphone. Living Goods uses mobile communications to monitor, increase sales, provide health information, and drive prompt treatment. SMS is used to broadcast product promotions. Agents also send SMS messages to report on treatments in their community. After clients are registered they receive a free sequence of personalized, automated treatment adherence reminders. Clients call or text their agent for help, if they want a visit, or if they need advice. =Replication= Living Goods is attempting to build the field of micro- franchising and direct-selling to the poor. The organization works with NGOs, consumer businesses, governments and other social enterprises to adapt and replicate its open source model. Living Goods states that it takes inspiration from Mohamed Yunus, the creator of Grameen Bank, whose ideas were used to create thousands of microfinance institutions around the world outside of Grameen itself. Living Goods has a dedicated advisory services team for organizations that need technical assistance rolling out the model. Partners include PSI, Brac, and Marie Stopes International. Supporters Living Goods has received funding from the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, Omidyar Network, the Mulago Foundation, Jasmine Social Investments, the Peery Foundation, and many other foundations. External reviews =GiveWell review= Charity evaluator GiveWell singled out Living Goods for special recognition in 2009 because Living Goods was cooperating with the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab to perform a rigorous evaluation of its program. In 2011, Tobias Pfutze, an Assistant Professor of Economics, participated in GiveWell's \\"Find the Best Charity\\" experiment whereby he would spend about ten hours researching the best charity (or charities) using GiveWell and then allocate $2500 (funded by GiveWell) to the charity or charities. Pfutze allocated the entire $2500 to Living Goods and explained the rationale for his decision to GiveWell in an interview. GiveWell followed up with a blog post discussing some of the issues raised in the discussion. In October 2014, GiveWell announced that it intended to make a $100,000 grant to Living Goods, and simultaneously published an \\"ongoing review\\" of Living Goods as well as a blog post about it. On December 1, 2014, GiveWell announced its top charities and standout charities for the year. Living Goods was among the standout charities, alongside Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition's Universal Salt Iodization Program, International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, and Development Media International. Media coverage Living Goods has been covered in The New York Times, NBC, The Guardian, The Economist, National Public Radio,, and other news and opinion sources.

It is the 32nd mall opened by Robinsons and the 3rd mall in Quezon City, Metro Manila. It has a gross floor area of . Robinsons Magnolia is part of the four-tower Magnolia Residences where the iconic Magnolia Ice Cream production plant once stood. History The Magnolia Dairy Products Plant was established in 1970 when Magnolia transferred production from its original 1925-era factory in Quiapo, Manila. Designed by Leandro Locsin, The plant produced ice cream, milk, butter, margarine and processed cheese. The property where the plant stood was owned by San Miguel Corporation, which also owned the Magnolia brand. The facility also housed the main branch of its Magnolia ice cream parlor. The ice cream parlor was retained and relocated within the mall. In 1981, SMC spun off its butter, margarine and processed cheese assets into a joint-venture with New Zealand Dairy Board, forming Philippine Dairy Products Corporation (now, Magnolia, Inc.). The Aurora Boulevard plant remained as its production facility until 2000 when it transferred to a new facility in General Trias, Cavite. When SMC spun off its ice cream and milk business into a joint-venture with Nestl√© in 1996, forming Magnolia-Nestl√© Corporation, the Aurora Boulevard property remained under the ownership of SMC and served as the venture's main production facility and site of its ice cream parlor. After SMC withdrew from the venture in 1998, Nestl√© Philippines continued with the business under the Nestl√© brand name (the ice cream parlor became known as Nestl√© Creamery). Nestl√©'s production was gradually transferred to a new site and in 1999, Nestl√© closed down operations in the Aurora Boulevard facility. In 2008, SMC sold the property to Robinsons Land Corporation (RLC), a subsidiary of JG Summit Holdings, Inc. News reports cited that the property was sold reportedly in the amount of P1.6 billion. The property was developed by RLC into a mall (Robinsons Magnolia) and residential condominiums (The Magnolia Residences). One of the mall's first establishments was a Magnolia-franchised ice cream parlor named Magnolia Flavor House, which operated from 2012 to 2017, as a fitting homage to the property's roots. Mall Expansion An expansion of the mall is currently on-going that will be located close to the Towers C & D of The Magnolia Residences. Starbucks, Magnolia ice cream, and half of the plaza are now closed to give way for the expansion works. Starbucks was relocated to the 3rd floor. The expansion opened on September 20, 2019. The new expansion will have a refreshed open-air plaza with al fresco dining, more shops and restaurants, four new cinemas including a VIP theater, a family amusement center and a chapel in the 6th floor. There will be also five levels of BPO and Office space located atop the expansion wing. The expansion will be connected to the main mall.

The property became a summer residence for wealthy Hamburg citizens from 1651. The current house was built in the early 18th century by the cloth merchant Eybert Tiefbrunn, and his coat of arms is still found over the main entrance door, with the year 1703 inscribed. The building is a rare example of a baroque brick building from the era. In the 19th century, the property included an estate of 605 hectare (6050 decare) land, and the manor house was surrounded by 7 hectare (70 decare) park. Coat of arms of Eybert Tiefbrunn over the main entrance From 1793 to 1823, the manor house was owned by the Berenberg/Gossler banking family and was well known as a meeting place of Hamburg high society with many famous regular guests such as Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher and Philipp Otto Runge. It served as the summer residence of Elisabeth Gossler n√©e Berenberg, the matriarch of the family. Her, at that time deceased, husband was Johann Hinrich Gossler, a great-grandson of Eybert Tiefbrunn, for whom the house was built a century earlier.Hamburgische Biografie-Personenlexikon, Volume 2, edited by Franklin Kopitzsch, Dirk BrietzkeThe Frustberg manor house In 1823, the Gossler family sold the property to Wilhelm Schr√∂der, who was married to Salomon Heine's eldest daughter Fanny. Their grandson Otto Nanne owned the property from 1872 to 1906, when he sold it to the factory owner August Herbst. Due to financial difficulties, Herbst sold the property to the Hamburg government in 1928‚Äì29. Since 1937, the manor house has been listed as a cultural heritage site. The park had by 1957 been reduced to 4800 m¬≤. The manor house is traditionally known as the Frustberg House.Johannes Langenbuch, \\"Der Frustberg in Gro√ü Borstel,\\" Hamburgische Geschichts- und Heimatbl√§tter, vol. 19, 1961/1963, pp. 85‚Äì89 The house was officially given the name Stavenhagenhaus in honour of the poet Fritz Stavenhagen in 1962, with a ceremony presided over by Helmut Schmidt. However, Stavenhagen has no association with the house's history and the building is also referred to as the Frustberg House or as the Tiefbrunn House. The name Gossler House has also been used.

Eskander currently resides in Melbourne, though travels to the Northern Territory (of Australia) for business. Personal life Eskander was exposed at an early aged to the life of bookmaking through his father's business activities. Eskander's father, Michael, immigrated to Australia from Egypt in 1966, earning his bookmaking licence in 1984, and subsequently going on to become a prominent name in the Australian bookmaking industry. Eskander spent much of his childhood at the race track and betting ring, learning lessons that would later inform his career on the track. Talking about early life as a bookmaker's son, and of the nature of the industry in general, Eskander recounts: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt get too excited when you have really big days and similarly you try not to get too upset when you have losing days but obviously anything outside the norm does impact your mood. And so yeah, there were some times when we had plans to go out for dinner on a Saturday night and Dad would come home and go, ‚Äòlisten guys, [we‚Äôll] just stay at home, it‚Äôs been a rough day.‚Äù Career =Early days= Eskander's first practical introduction to bookmaking came from working as a clerk for his father's booking making business at the age of 18, while studying Commerce at university. While this would eventually shape the future to come, Eskander initially viewed this more as a means to pay his way through his degree. Says Eskander: ‚ÄúIt was just a great part time job. I worked with Dad, I was a clerk,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWorking on the racetrack is dynamic and exciting.‚Äù Receiving his first bookmaker's license in 1997, Eskander started fielding country race tracks before being granted his Metropolitan rails licence in 2000, during his final year at university. After working for some years with his father, and with his Metropolitan bookmaking license behind him, Eskander began operating on his own as a bookmaker in Victoria at country race meetings. ‚ÄúI was trading as a sole proprietor under my own name, Dad was trading under his name and we paralleled and it was fine.‚Äù recalls Eskander. The Eskander family name has become synonymous with racing and bookmaking in Australia with Alan's sister, Lisa, also a licensed bookmaker. As testament to Eskander's early acumen on the racetrack, he obtained recognition as having accepted millions of dollars in bets during the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival and the Sydney Autumn Carnival, prior to forming corporate booking making company Eskander's Betstar with his father, Michael. =Forming Betstar= Combining 40 years of bookmaking experience on racing and sports across Australia, Eskander, along with father and long-time bookmaking bastion, Michael, formed Eskander's Betstar in 2006, a Corporate Bookmaking operation licensed and based in Melbourne and Darwin. In 2009, Betsar had the honour of being named as a BRW Fast 100 company for 2009. During Eskander's acceptance of the award, he reflected on the success of Betstar to date as being a result of ‚Äúgood old fashioned service‚Äù. Said Eskander at the time, \\"The bookmaking industry is highly competitive so you need to look after your members, we often get feedback that dealing with Betstar is like dealing with a good mate which is a stark contrast to the 'next please' service offered by some of our competitors.\\" Betstar has quickly grown to become one of Australia's most reputable corporate bookmakers, offering markets on sports, racing and entertainment on events around the world. Currently, Betstar is the only family owned Australian corporate bookmaker left in the market. For this reason, Betstar tends to be patriotic in its advertising without being over the top, promoting the fact that profits stay in Australia rather than get siphoned off overseas. Alan's opinion is respected in the media and he is often a guest on 3AW's Sports Today as well as his opinions represented on their website. He has featured on other radio stations, including the Bet Stars and Stripes show which runs on SEN's 'All Night Appetite' and has featured on an ABC report into NRL betting.

No North Korean person exists outside the inminban system; everyone is a member. History The inminban network was established by the late 1960s. Every North Korean woman who does not have a full-time job is required to participate in inminban activities, which include cleaning public toilets, tidying up the neighbourhood, manufacturing small items at home, and occasionally going to the countryside to do agricultural work. This made women without jobs nearly as busy as those with jobs, and was said to contribute to high female participation in the North Korea workforce. In the late 1960s employed North Korean women received a 700 gram ration of rice daily, where women who participated in inminban instead of having a job received just 300 grams. Since the 1990s, the effectiveness of the inminban network has weakened. Structure A typical inminban consists of 25-50 families and is defined by residential proximity. For example, an inminban might consist of all families sharing a common staircase in a large apartment building. Each inminban is headed by an official, usually a middle-aged woman, known as inminbanjang (people's unit head). She will ordinarily receive a small stipend for her work from the state, as well as additional food rations. The inminban system is not formally part of the North Korean security apparatus, but supports it. All inminban members are responsible for monitoring each other for criminal activity or political disobedience. The inminbanjang meets regularly with party authorities, and reports misbehaviour to them. The local district office people's committee (Ê¥û‰∫ãÂãôÊâÄ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂßîÂì°ÊúÉ) oversees her work and passes down to her Workers' Party of Korea directives. Some scholars say that the North Korean economic crisis and subsequent famine of the 1990s has left North Korea unable to compensate functionaries such as inminbanjang, reducing their incentive to help the state maintain social control. Inminbanjang are said to still be an important support to the North Korean security apparatus, but perhaps less motivated and diligent than they used to be. In addition to surveillance, the inminban engages in managing neighborhoods by, for instance, taking care of garbage.

By extension, he leads the development strategy of the ONA and the Soci√©t√© Nationale d‚ÄôInvestissement (SNI): those two companies became the armed wings of the national shift of the economy. Majidi‚Äôs mission is to establish a new economic governance around \\"national champions\\", specifically in high-growth sectors such as telecommunications, energy, transportation, banking, health, tourism, real estate and retail. This strategy aims to make Morocco a key economic player in northwestern area of Africa, and by extent across the continent. =Other Activities= In 2003, King Mohammed nominated Mounir Majidi president of the Cheikh Zaid foundation to handle the operations and the development of the Cheikh Zaid hospital in Rabat.

It premiered on December 21, 1932 . Cast * President Eusebio Ayala ... Himself * Mariscal Jos√© F√©lix Estigarribia ... Himself * Julia Miranda Cueto ... Herself Overview The Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay originated in a dispute over the sovereignty of the Chaco Boreal region. Open warfare ran from September 1932 to June 1935, however, the respective armies had prepared for hostilities well in advance. The Argentine cameraman and cinematographer Roque Funes traveled to the region in July 1932 and recorded the first three months of the conflict, focusing specially on the batlle of Boqueron. Back in Buenos Aires, Funes immediately cut footage and rolled maps and explanatory texts into a documentary. The film was thought lost for many years, but an original copy to nitrate was retained by the Estrag√≥ family in Paraguay. Hugo Gamarra, President of the Cinematheque of Paraguay, worked with APROCINAIN on restoration of this copy in Buenos Aires, with the cooperation of Cinecolor and Kodak. Appearing in the film were Eusebio Ayala, President of Paraguay, Marshal Jos√© F√©lix Estigarribia, commander of the Paraguayan troops, and his wife Julia Miranda Cueto. The two later had a violent death: shortly after being elected president of Paraguay on August 15, 1939, Estigarribia died alongside his wife on September 7, 1940 in a plane crash in Loma Grande. Comments The film is said to be: \\"Elemental in ideology, the enemy is demonized as Bolivian counterpart to the heroic deeds performed by Paraguay at a disadvantage. It is also a unique historical document, by the fact that records, such as film (with creative resources and improbable mood for your theme) and as journalism\\". Roque Funes said: \\"Nobody can give a full account of what this is. The fighting leaves a trail of mangled bodies and the stench from the decay of rapidly decomposing corpses\\". Advertisement The advertisement banner of the film, whose ticket cost two pesos, reads: \\"The only film of the Paraguayan-Bolivian war, filmed with the permission of the Government of Paraguay. The real expression of the struggle in the Chaco Boreal, under a sky of fire, shot by the \\"cameraman\\" Argentina Roque Funes, who with the kind collaboration of the Government of Paraguay, managed to take the most interesting notes of the current war. The attack on Boquer√≥n. The Bolivian offensive. Flying over the line of fire. Troops pushing through the jungle. Bayonet charge. Artillery in action. Fall of Boqueron. Wounded and captured up to Asuncion and a thousand scenes of war taken in the same fields from the front. The horror and heroism of the man in front of thirst, hunger and death.\\"  References  External links * Category:Documentary films about the Chaco War Category:Argentine films Category:Paraguayan films Category:Argentine documentary films Category:Argentine black-and-white films Category:1932 documentary films Category:1932 films Category:Spanish-language films Category:Films shot in Paraguay Category:Black-and-white documentary films Category:Argentine silent films ","title":"In the Hell of Chaco"},{"id":"36716241","text":"Destry Rides Again is an album by American jazz pianist Randy Weston recorded in 1959 featuring music from the musical comedy Destry Rides Again and originally released on the United Artists label.Randy Weston discography accessed August 14, 2012 Reception Allmusic awarded the album 3 stars.Allmusic Review, accessed August 14, 2012  Track listing  All compositions by Harold Rome # \\"We‚Äôre Ladies - 1:53 # \\"I Know Your Kind\\" - 2:29 # \\"Rose Lovejoy of Paradise Alley\\"- 2:29 # \\"Anyone Would Love You\\"- 3:04 # \\"Once Knew a Fella\\" - 2:15 # \\"Every Once in a While\\" - 2:13 # \\"Fair Warning\\" - 2:50 # \\"Are You Ready Gyp Watson?\\" - 1:46 # \\"That Ring on the Finger\\" - 2:08 # \\"Once Knew a Fella (Reprise)\\" - 2:39 # \\"I Say Hello\\" - 2:50  Personnel  *Randy Weston - piano *Slide Hampton, Bennie Green, Melba Liston, Frank Rehak - trombone *Peck Morrison - bass *Elvin Jones - drums *Willie Rodriguez - percussion  References  Category:Randy Weston albums Category:1959 albums Category:Albums arranged by Melba Liston Category:United Artists Records albums ","title":"Destry Rides Again (Randy Weston album)"},{"id":"36716249","text":"John Burt may refer to: * John Burt (footballer), English footballer * John Burt (rugby union) (1874‚Äì1933), New Zealand rugby union player, cricketer and businessman * John Burt (field hockey) (1877‚Äì1935), Scottish field hockey player * John Burt (anti-abortion activist) (1938‚Äì2013), American anti- abortion activist and child-molester * John Graham MacDonald Burt (1809‚Äì1868), Scottish physician and author * John H.

Research into this indication has been largely halted as a result of disappointing trial results, but Roche continues to develop bitopertin for the treatment of obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder (OCD). Bitopertin is a glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitor that increases levels of the neurotransmitter glycine by inhibiting its reuptake from the synaptic cleft. Glycine acts as a required co-agonist along with glutamate at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Dysfunction of NMDA receptors may play a key role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and modulation of glutamatergic signalling via increased concentrations of glycine in the synaptic cleft may help potentiate NMDA receptor function and improve the symptoms of schizophrenia.\\"Bitopertin for schizophrenia\\" , \\"EuroScan\\", 14 August 2012 In a phase II proof-of-concept study, patients on bitopertin experienced a significant improvement in the change of the Negative Symptom Factor Score from baseline within 8 weeks (from ‚àí4.86 in the placebo group to ‚àí6.65 in the treatment group, p<0.05, per-protocol population).

Subsequently, in April 2014, Roche announced that it was discontinuing all except one of its phase III trials of bitopertin for schizophrenia. Though Roche has largely ceased its studies of bitopertin for schizophrenia, it is also investigating the drug in the treatment of OCD, and is continuing its development for this indication. As of August 2014, bitopertin is in phase II clinical trials for OCD.

The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim drafted him in the first round of the 2009 MLB draft from Lamar Consolidated High School in Rosenberg, Texas. He played five seasons in the Angels' minor leagues system, losing time to injury but also developing home-run hitting ability throughout. The Angels traded him to the St. Louis Cardinals in November 2013, and he made his major league debut on April 28, 2014. Grichuk can hit for power, and provides speed and strong defense. He plays all three outfield positions, possessing a strong arm and patrolling mainly right field in the minor leagues. Originally projected to be a first baseman before the draft, he improved his outfield defense and won the Gold Glove Award for all minor league right fielders in 2013. Early life and amateur career In 2003 and 2004, Grichuk participated in the Little League World Series for Lamar National of Richmond, Texas. He was featured in Sports Illustrateds \\"Faces in the Crowd\\" section in July 2005. Grichuk attended Lamar Consolidated High School in Rosenberg, Texas. In 2008, as a Lamar Consolidated Baseball player, he was a First Team All-State OF and the All-Houston Area Most Valuable Player (MVP). That season, Grichuk batted .435 with 18 HR and 45 RBI, leading the Mustangs to a school record 29 wins and a Regional Final appearance. In 2009, he was the 24-4A District MVP, Fort Bend Area MVP, 2009 1st Team All State OF, and 2009 1st Team All-American (EA Sports and Baseball America). In 28 games he hit .613 with 21 HR, 46 hits, 46 RBI and 47 runs before Lamar was defeated in the third round of the playoffs. On his 28th birthday, Grichuk revealed that he is of Czechoslovak & Russian descent. Professional career =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2009‚Äì13)= Grichuk committed to attend the University of Arizona. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim drafted Grichuk in the first round, with the 24th overall selection, in the 2009 MLB draft, one selection ahead of Mike Trout. Grichuk signed with the Angels, rather than attend college. A series of three unusual injuries delayed the outfield prospect's development. First, he tore a ligament after just 12 games in . Second, he batted a foul ball that fractured his knee cap. Finally, while diving for a ball, he broke his wrist. In 2012, his first full season, Grichuk played 135 games and batted .298 with 18 home runs and 71 runs batted in with the Class-A Inland Empire 66ers. After a promotion to the Double-A Arkansas Travelers in 2013, he made 128 appearances, batting .256 with 22 HR and 64 RBI. In October, 2013, Rawlings and MiLB announced Grichuk was the recipient of the Minor League Gold Glove Award for right field. MLB.com ranked Grichuk as the Angels' No. 4 prospect after the 2013 season, and the club added him to their 40-man roster on November 20, 2013. Two days later, they traded him along with Peter Bourjos to the St. Louis Cardinals for David Freese and Fernando Salas. =St. Louis Cardinals (2014‚Äì2017)= 2014‚àí15 Grichuk began the 2014 season with the Memphis Redbirds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. The Cardinals promoted him to the majors for the first time on April 28, 2014, after he had batted .310 with a .359 OBP, .529 SLG, six walks and 17 strikeouts. He debuted as a defensive replacement in the outfield that day. Grichuk made his first major league start in center field the next day, collecting a single in five at-bats for his first major league hit. The Cardinals optioned him back to Memphis shortly thereafter. On May 21, he showed the authorities what he could do with a big game-winning home run versus the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, giving an anonymous fan an autograph after the game. Shortly afterwards, the Cardinals recalled him to the big leagues on May 30. He improved his AAA numbers, batting .315 with a .363 OBP, .589 SLG and ten HR. Grichuk received the Cardinals' minor league system Player of the Month Award for May, 2014. On June 7, he hit his first major league home run off Toronto Blue Jays' starter Mark Buehrle in a 5‚Äì0 victory. Grichuk produced a .944 on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) in 44 spring training at bats in 2015 and made the major league club as a fifth outfielder. While lifting weights, he strained his lower back, halting his play on April 16 and prompting the Cardinals to place him on the 15-day DL. On May 16, the Cardinals activated him from the disabled list. After striking out five times on May 18, he followed up with two doubles and a triple the next night against the New York Mets, as the Cardinals prevailed 10‚Äì2. When Matt Holliday went on the DL in early June, that opened Grichuk's first legitimate opportunity for regular playing time in the major leagues, including all three outfield positions. From June 19‚Äì20 against the Philadelphia Phillies, he forged consecutive three-hit games, including hitting a home run in the first game, then two in the second. On June 30, he was a double short of hitting for the cycle in a 2‚Äì1 loss to the Chicago White Sox. His home run off Chris Sale traveled , however, and landed in the Big Mac Land section of Busch Stadium. Through that point in the season, it was the longest home run of the year there by a Cardinals player. Setting a new career high with six runs batted in on July 18, Grichuk also homered twice in a 12‚Äì2 win over the Mets. On August 5 against the Cincinnati Reds, he doubled in the sixth inning and hit the game-winning home run in the top of the 13th at Great American Ball Park in a 4‚Äì3 game. After straining his right elbow, the Cardinals placed Grichuk on the disabled list on August 17. The Cardinals reactivated him less than one month later. On September 10, he played center field against the Chicago Cubs, but was not permitted to throw as his elbow had still not fully recovered. After the season, he underwent surgery to repair a sports hernia. 2016‚àí17 Grichuk batting for the Memphis Redbirds in Out of spring training in 2016, Grichuk won the role as starting center fielder. He hit his first career walk- off home run on May 23 in a 4‚Äì3 win against the Cubs. With his overall offensive output in decline from the previous year, the Cardinals optioned him to, and recalled him from, Memphis on multiple occasions in 2016. On August 13, 2016 ‚àí his 25th birthday ‚àí Grichuk hit his first career grand slam, providing the margin in an 8‚àí4 win over the Cubs, and ending their 11-game win streak. He produced the game-winning RBI double on August 19 against Philadelphia Phillies in the 11th inning of a 4‚àí3 win. Grichuk ended 2016 with a .240 batting average along with 24 home runs and 48 RBIs.http://m.mlb.com/player/545341/randal-grichuk On April 2, 2017, Opening Night versus the defending World Series champion Chicago Cubs at Busch Stadium, Grichuk homered and hit a walk-off bases-loaded single in the bottom of the ninth. =Toronto Blue Jays= On January 19, 2018, the Cardinals traded Grichuk to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for pitchers Dominic Leone and Conner Greene. He began the season as Toronto's starting right fielder. On March 30, Grichuk hit his first home run as a Blue Jay, which came on the first pitch he saw from Masahiro Tanaka in the 2nd inning of a 4‚Äì2 loss to the New York Yankees. After batting only .106 with two home runs and seven RBIs in 25 games, he was placed on the disabled list with a right knee strain on April 30.http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/23370933/toronto-blue-jays-put-randal- grichuk-disabled-list-knee-sprain He was activated on June 1.https://www.mlb.com/news/randal-grichuk-aledmys-diaz-activated/c-279312742 Grichuk finished the season batting .245/.301/.502 and tied for first on the team in home runs with Justin Smoak with 25. On April 2, 2019, Grichuk and the Blue Jays agreed to a five-year contract extension worth $52 million. In 2019, he led the team in both home runs (31) and runs batted in (80) despite hitting .232/.280/.457. On July 26, 2020, Grichuk was removed from a game against the Tampa Bay Rays after experiencing discomfort in his right SI joint. Overall with the 2020 Blue Jays, Grichuk batted .273 with 12 home runs and 35 RBIs in 55 games. Awards and accomplishments ;Awards * Baseball America All-Rookie Team Outfielder (2015) * Cardinals Minor League system Player of the Month (May 2014) * Rawlings Minor League Baseball Gold Glove Award, right field (2013) * Topps All-Star Rookie at outfield (2015) Skills profile In 2014, Randal Grichuk was projected with potential as a power hitter in the major leagues possessing the athleticism and preparedness to handle center field well. At the plate, his most evident ability is to hit the ball with power and loft to all fields, easily give him potential for 20 or more home runs a season. With a smooth and compact stroke, his bat speed through the zone is at least average and frequently faster. His pitch recognition allows him the ability to work counts and he becomes more aggressive in hitter's counts. This approach yields lower-than-average walk rates but with a strikeout rate of less than 20 percent. One obvious weakness is that he misses easy pitches ‚Äì such as high fastballs in the middle of the plate ‚Äì that major league hitters rarely miss. According to Baseball America's Kary Booher, Grichuk possesses an athletic frame with average arm and enough range to profile into an outfield corner slot. Through 2013, he has shown a low walk rate but has enough balance and bat control to bat .260 or higher in the major leagues. Grichuk drew widespread attention for his raw power and bat speed in 2015. As of August 11, 2015, the average exit velocity of all his batted balls on the season was seventh in the major leagues at . The average for all fly balls and line drives only was fourth at . Originally projected to be a first baseman, Grichuk expanded his versatility to the outfield thanks in part to extra preparation and a sleek and proportioned athletic frame. For what he lacks in the classic speed of center fielders, he mitigates with robust jumps and precise route running and positioning to easily anticipate the trajectory of ‚Äì and catch ‚Äì balls hit to the outfield. His arm strength and range allow him the ability to cut off runners at times from extra bases on the occasional plays for which he did not properly position himself.

She grew up in Taiwan and moved to the United States in 1963 to attend the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Fine Arts. She was a professor of painting and art history at University of the Arts (Philadelphia) from 1968 until 1998. As founder and executive director of The Village of Arts and Humanities in North Philadelphia from 1968 to 2004, she helped create a national model in creative place-making and community building through the arts. In 2002, Yeh pursued her work internationally, founding Barefoot Artists, Inc., to bring the transformative power of art to impoverished communities around the globe through participatory, multifaceted projects that foster community empowerment, improve the physical environment, promote economic development and preserve indigenous art and culture. In addition to the United States, she has carried out projects in several other countries. She is the subject of the feature- length documentary film The Barefoot Artist directed by Glenn Holsten and Daniel Traub. Yeh has been included in the Asian American Arts Centre's artasiamerica digital archive. Projects =The Village of Arts and Humanities= Lily Yeh co-founded The Village of Arts and Humanities in 1989. The project began as a simple park-building project in North Philadelphia in 1986 involving neighborhood children, and developed into a private, nonprofit, community-based organization dedicated to neighborhood revitalization through the arts. By 2004, the Village had become a professional organization with an annual budget of $1.3 million and a dedicated staff of sixteen full-time and ten part-time employees including a four-person construction crew. During the last decade of her sojourn, the organization has yearly served over thousands of low-income, primarily African-American youth and families, covering several neighborhoods within a 260 square block area in North Philadelphia and transformed more than 120 vacant lots into gardens and parks.All That We Share: How to Save the Economy, the Environment, the Internet, Democracy, Our Communities and Everything Else that Belongs to All of Us with Bill McKibben Introduction (2011) They have also renovated vacant homes, creating art workshops, a youth theater and educational programs. The Village received many national awards including the Coming Up Taller Award from the President's Committee on Arts and Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts, Washington, D.C. in 2000 and the gold medal Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence from the Bruner Foundation in Cambridge, MA in 2001. In 2003, the Village received a Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Governor's Award for Environmental Excellence. In 2007, The Village received the prestigious Champion in Action from Citizens Bank for its building community through the arts effort since 1986. In 2004, Yeh left the Village of Arts and Humanities to pursue other work internationally. =Unimaginable Isolation: Stories from Graterford Prison= In 2001,Yeh, in collaboration with artists Gerry Givnish and Glenn Holsten, launched a three-year, multi-level interactive project among long-term inmates in the Graterford Prison in Skippack Township,Pennsylvania. The effort resulted in several multi-media exhibitions across Philadelphia, including the Eastern State Penitentiary, a U.S. National Historic Landmark, the University of the Arts, the Painted Bride Art Center and the Village of Arts and Humanities. =American Visionary Art Museum, Baltimore= In 2005, Yeh was invited as guest curator by the American Visionary Art Museum. She introduced and curated the wall-sized papercut pieces by the late Chinese folk artist Ku Shu-Lan in the exhibition Race, Class, Gender ‚â† Character at AVAM. Rebecca Alban Hoffberger, Director and Founder of the Museum dedicated its 11th mega-exhibition to Lily Yeh because ‚Äúher work so artfully and lovingly transcends race, class, nationality and gender.‚Äù =The Bridge Over Barriers Project, Salt Lake City, Utah= Invited by NeighborWorks of Salt Lake City, Yeh led a major public art project from 2005 to 2009, which transformed the eyesore of a 22,000 feet of cement- surfaced viaduct over a ten-lane interstate highway into a place of community pride. The process engaged the participation of 25 local artists and 1,500 neighborhood adults and children. It is the most ambitious, community-based public art in the State of Utah. =Urban Alchemy, Milwaukee, Wisconsin= The Urban Alchemy Project led by Lily Yeh since 2014 began a dialogue to address racial inequality, separation, segregation, brokenness, poverty, lack of community-driven solutions, disempowerment and isolation. The projects aims to allow residents to see how art can help to heal and create as well as participate in a process within a unique environment that bridges neighborhoods. Lily Yeh co-created with artists, neighborhood residents, children, and volunteers on an art installation that transformed a sterile and unfrequented urban space ‚Äî Holton Viaduct Swing Park ‚Äî into a colorful and jubilant place. Urban Alchemy also worked with The City‚Äôs Department of Public Works to grant permission and timeline for community based installations. =Ecuador - Art projects in Salinas and Ambato= In 2000, Lily Yeh traveled to Ecuador with artist Andres Chamorro to conduct workshops in visual and performing arts for youths and adults from different communities in the highlands of Ecuador, including Quito, Salinas, and Ambato.

Collaborating with her hosts, Paa Ya Paa Art Center and St. John‚Äôs Catholic Church, Yeh organized children and adults in the community to convert a bleak churchyard on the edge of the dumpsite into a brightly painted garden. Through her effort, the Village of Arts and Humanities in North Philadelphia collaborated with several artists from Korogocho and Nairobi in the late 1990s. The Village sponsored a two-year arts program for 200 street children in Korogocho. In 2004, collaborating with Life Learning group in the community, Yeh conducted workshops for hundreds of youth in their HIV/AIDS prevention program in Korogocho and its five adjacent communities.

She designed the Rugerero Genocide Memorial Monument Park in 2004 and it was built in 2005 with help from hundreds of local villagers. Yeh launched multiple programs in healing, education, and job opportunities to transform the survivors and the Twa villages in Rugerero from destitution and grief into vibrant and joyful self-sustaining communities. The Rugerero Survivors Village Transformation honors the living by equipping the surviving family members with economic resources and tools to heal, learn skills, and take actions to better their lives. =China= Invited by the Chinese Cultural Ministry during the 80‚Äôs, Yeh conducted lecture tours in twelve cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Hongzhou, Shouzhou, Wuhan, and Uramchi. In 1984, she assisted the city of Philadelphia in establishing a multi-leveled cultural exchange program with its sister city Tianjin in China. In 1986, as a visiting artist, she presented a series of lectures in Lhasa, Tibet.

The project engaged the entire school community of 670 members - students, teachers, staff, and volunteers, in a co-creative process to transform the formerly sterile and bleak school environment into a place of beauty and joy and a place that inspires learning, creativity and exploration. =The Chi Chong School Mosaic Mural Project, Taipei= Invited in 2004 by The Culture Ministry of Taipei to participate in its Public Art Forum and Festival, Yeh was commissioned to create a mural for a five-story building located in Chi Chong School for handicapped and hearing-impaired children. Engaging art teachers and students in the design process, Yeh incorporated many of the images emerged from the art workshops in her design for the mural. The curator of the project mobilized the Chi Chong school community, a tile making factory and volunteers from all sectors of life to participate in the making of the mural. Over 400 people from different cities in Taiwan took part in the project, which was among the top nominees for a prestigious 2005 public art award in Taiwan. =Taiwan, The Painted Labyrinth Project, Hua Lian= Lily Yeh designed and led the installation of a 150-meter diameter labyrinth containing 200 pieces of 10 foot tall painted drift wood at the foothills of the Hua Don Mountains on the east coast of Taiwan. This installation is one of the eight environmental sculptures commissioned by the Masadi ‚Äì Green Wonder, an international art project and exhibition sponsored by the Hualien Forestry Department. The project engaged the participation of 300 school children of the indigenous Ahmei Tribe and 200 senior citizens and volunteers. =Taiwan ‚Äì Revitalization and Preservation Project in Taitung County= The Chong An and Da Niao villages are located in the remote mountainous area in Taitung County at the south-east coast of Taiwan. Like other Taiwanese aboriginal tribes, the Ah Mei and Paiwan people have been persecuted through generations. Their land was appropriated driving the communities further and further to the remote shores and mountains of Eastern Taiwan. Around 2005, a group of activist citizens began to put their attention to these aboriginal tribes of Taiwan to save the culture and tradition of the villages through education, agriculture, and economic initiatives. To make their effort more visible, Lily Yeh was invited to participate in 2012. During her two-week visit, Yeh conducted workshops that used storytelling, art, collaborative design, and mural painting to jumpstart the project. Through the process, local artists and leaders emerged lifting the community spirit. The work continued throughout the year. In Da Niao village, participants have completed the transformation of a derelict and forgotten building into a colorful structure decorated with totem images of the Paiwan tribe and idyllic landscapes. The project imbued the tribe people with new pride and hope. In Chong An village, the activist group converted a run-down traditional structure and its surroundings into a vibrant environment, brightened up by images that emerged from the workshops in which children and adults worked together. The three-year project made the place visible and helped the villagers to bond in a new way. =Taiwan, Awakening Creativity Project, An Kang= Located on the outskirts of Taipei, the An Kang neighborhood has deteriorated due to the concentration of low- income residents. In 2013, Lily Yeh led a three-day workshop for children and adults living in An Kang public housing in a poor and neglected area to imagine and create together their re-developed community through story-sharing and art. The result was presented to the Urban Redevelopment Department of Taiwan University which oversaw the An Kang redevelopment project for the city of Taipei. =The Children‚Äôs Art Project, Damascus= While visiting Iraqi refugees in Jordan and Syria, Yeh collaborated with activist Noor Sheik Ogly and several Red Crescent members, and launched an art event with a simple exhibition and a workshop at Al Tijari Park in Damascus. Together they engaged two dozen of children and some of their parents in photography, drawing, painting and story-telling. Based on their drawings, children created a large and colorful painting together. Yeh turned the portrait photos of the children, their stories and art works into a colorful hand-made book, which was exhibited in Beijing, China in 2008 and then given to Project Learn School in Philadelphia as an exchange present. =Nablus, Balata Refugee Camp, Al Aqaba= Adjacent to the city of Nablus, Balata is the largest refugee camp in the West Bank. Working with volunteers, leaders of the Balata Women Center, students of the Balata Girls‚Äô School, and local youth, Yeh created a 14‚Äôx 25‚Äô mural, the Palestinian Tree of Peace. She returned in 2012 to work with residents to transform a narrow and derelict pedestrian street into a space filled with colors and beauty. In 2013, she returned with a five-membered international team to transform environments through mural painting at Balata Refugee Camp, Nablus, and Al Aqaba village. =The Dzegvi Children's Project, Tbilisi= Collaborating with filmmaker Glenn Holsten and photographer Daniel Traub, Yeh traveled in 1999 to Dzegvi, a little village nearby Tbilisi containing twenty families and 110 street children, to conduct workshops with children in drawing, painting and photography. Children and several family groups took photos of each other, their activities and environment. At the end of the project, an exhibition of 15 big, life size banners of individual and group figures and hundreds of the photographs were exhibited at Dzegvi. The project also produced a 12-minute film describing the Dzegvi community through the eyes of one particular family. =G√∂rlitz, Germany= In 2016, Lily Yeh and the Barefoot Artists were invited to G√∂rlitz by a group of local artists under the auspices of \\"Bohemian Crossings\\". Located in East Germany, G√∂rlitz and its people have also known many hardships, most recently under communist- rule. High unemployment, dwindling populations and rows of abandoned or decaying buildings speak to the forced obliteration of history and loss of identity which they experienced. The Barefoot Artists work together with the international artists to bring the memory and the cultural heritage back to the people.

Parikrma addresses the growing gap in urban India between those benefitting from economic liberalization and those who are not, in which consequently only a minority of children in India can afford access to private schools where the content of education is of high quality and in the English medium. Children from the slums and rural communities attend schools in the free government-run mass schooling system, where they only teach in the state language, which often proves insufficient in attaining job opportunities in a rapidly globalizing world. The name Parikrma comes from a combination of two Sanskrit words, \\"pari\\" meaning circle, and \\"krma\\" meaning to complete. Parikrma strives to complete \\"The Circle of Life\\" by supporting children from kindergarten until they procure a job, thus ensuring that their students break out of the cycle of poverty. Parikrma runs 4 Centres for Learning and a Junior College for 2000 children from 99 slum communities and 4 orphanages in Bangalore. Parikrma is a nondenominational nonprofit that does not discriminate on the basis of caste, creed, or religion.  History  Parikrma was founded in 2003 by Shukla Bose, who left at the peak of her career as a CEO in the hospitality industry with 26 years of experience. In order to establish Parikrma, she and her team personally visited numerous slum communities to understand the need and context of poverty in Bangalore, as well as to identify children who would potentially never have the opportunity to attend school, and convincing their parents that education could bring about positive change in their children's lives. The first Parikrma school began 2 June 2003 on a space rented on the rooftop of a Tamil-medium school with 165 students and 11 staff members. Parikrma Humanity Foundation provides English medium education to the poorest from the slums of Bangalore, India. Built around the CBSE curriculum, education at Parikrma includes sport, art, music, theatre, dance and wide exposure to the world. Parikrma also provides each child 3 meals a day, comprehensive healthcare and family care. The Parikrma Model allows for a child to be mentored right from Kindergarten till the child gets a job. Parikrma manages K-12 education, through 4 Centers for Learning and a Junior College for 1802 children coming from 99 slum communities and 4 orphanages. College scholarships are given to each child to complete professional education / training.  Educational Philosophy  Parikrma's educational philosophy rests on \\"The Four Pillars\\": * Empowering children by imparting superior knowledge, mental and physical skills, and good values * Providing real-life experience and enhancing useful life-skills * Self-expression through art, music, dance, and other creative forms * Exposure to a wide range of knowledge, viewpoints, activities, etc.  Academic Focus and Programs  Parikrma has adopted the CBSE English curriculum, built around the concept of understanding and making learning fun and experiential. Parikrma operates on a 360-degree development model, supporting various aspects of a child's life. They provide three meals a day, comprehensive healthcare including regular health check-ups, immunizations, and counseling, and community support for parents, including de-addiction programs, women's empowerment, wellness workshops, vocational skills, etc. Parikrma also believes in an end-to-end (e2e) model in which they look after a child from kindergarten until they are placed in a job, ensuring that they break out of a cycle of poverty, which they call completing \\"the Circle of Life.\\" Their Final Leap program aids a student in choosing the right professional course which matches their strengths and interests, or provides scholarships to pursue college or vocational training. Their Last Mile program provides a professional mentor while students acclimate to their first year in the workplace.  Impact  Alumni: The first batch of Parikrma students are now pursuing higher education and beginning to enter the workforce. Alumni from Parikrma are studying at various universities in Bangalore, such as the MR Ambedkar Dental College, National Law School of India University, KLE Law College, and M. S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology. They have also pursued jobs such as a dialysis therapist at Manipal Teaching Hospital, a software engineer at Cisco Systems, and as an assistant chef at the Hilton Hotel in Bangalore. Today, there are more than 300 students pursuing higher studies sponsored by Parikrma. These students are studying law, engineering, gaming, animation, design coding, paramedical courses, fashion technology and Parikrma has opened up doors for more creative and new age career choices. Parikrma students represent the country in Global Youth Leadership Summit in San Diego, and others do book reviews with schools from Seattle, London, and Norway. Parikrma FC: This club was born in 2013. PThey are currently Bangalore A Division team. Parikrma Girls FC: In 2018, Parikrma formed an all-girls football club in Bangalore.  Expansion and Scale  Community Development: The Community Development Services team is manned by social workers. Education Transformation Centre (ETC): Through ETC, launched in July 2014, Parikrma creates and offers teacher training modules to teachers, other NGO workers, school administrators and social entrepreneurs. The ETC began its operations in July, 2014. Teachers from 200 government schools are being trained and mentored to bring about change in the state education system, and Parikrma's goal is to influence 60,000 children through its Centres as well as the ETC. Adopted 5 Government Schools: Parikrma has adopted a school in 2017 - the Maruthinagar Government School.

It is specifically opposed to yellow shamanism, which incorporates rituals and traditions from Buddhism. Black Shamans are usually perceived as working with evil spirits, while white Shamans with spirits of the upper world.Kevin B. Turner Sky Shamans of Mongolia: Meetings with Remarkable Healers North Atlantic Books, 12.04.2016 Buddhism entered Mongolia in the sixteenth century after the conversion of Altan Khan. In 1691, after Outer Mongolia had been annexed by the Qing Dynasty, Buddhism became the dominant religion of the entire area and shamanism began incorporating Buddhist elements. Violent resistance in the eighteenth century by the hunting tribes of Northern Mongolia against the (Buddhist) ruling group, the Khalka Mongols, led to the foundation of black shamanism. Spirit world and class Klaus Hesse described the complex spiritual hierarchy in clan-based Mongolian society based on sources that go back to the 13th century. The highest group in the pantheon consisted of 99 tngri (55 of them benevolent or \\"white\\" and 44 terrifying or \\"black\\"), 77 natigai or \\"earth-mothers\\", besides others. The tngri were called upon only by leaders and great shamans and were common to all the clans. After these, three groups of ancestral spirits dominated. The \\"Lord-Spirits\\" were the souls of clan leaders to whom any member of a clan could appeal for physical or spiritual help. The \\"Protector-Spirits\\" included the souls of great shamans (ƒµigari) and shamanesses (abƒµiya). The \\"Guardian- Spirits\\" were made up of the souls of smaller shamans (b√∂ge) and shamanesses (idugan) and were associated with a specific locality (including mountains, rivers, etc.) in the clan's territory. The difference between great, white and small, black (in shamans, tngri, etc.) was also formative in a class division of three further groups of spirits, made up of \\"spirits who were not introduced by shamanist rites into the communion of ancestral spirits\\" but who could nonetheless be called upon for help‚Äîthey were called \\"'the three accepting the supplications' (jalbaril-un gurban)\\". The whites were of the nobles of the clan, the blacks of the commoners, and a third category consisted of \\"the evil spirits of the slaves and non-human goblins\\". White shamans could only venerate white spirits (and if they called upon black spirits they \\"lost their right in venerating and calling the white spirits\\"), black shamans only black spirits (and would be too terrified to call upon white spirits since the black spirits would punish them). Black or white was assigned to spirits according to social status, and to shamans \\"according to the capacity and assignment of their ancestral spirit or spirit of the shaman's descent line.\\"  Black shamanism in Mongolia  According to Otgony Purev, the practice goes back to Genghis Khan and was practiced by the Darkhad people in defiance of the Buddhism introduced to the area by the Khalka. During the Soviet domination of the Mongolian People's Republic, all varieties of shamanism were suppressed; after 1991, when the era of Soviet influence was over, religion (including Buddhism and shamanism) made a comeback.

The family lived from the Late Jurassic through the Late Cretaceous and is known from twenty-five genera. Mesoraphidiids have been found as both compression fossils and as inclusions in amber. The family was first proposed in 1925 by the Russian paleoentomologist Andrey Vasilyevich Martynov based on Upper Jurassic fossils recovered in Kazakhstan. The family was expanded in 2002 by the synonymizing of several other proposed snakefly families. The family was divided into three subfamilies and one tribe in a 2011 paper, further clarifying the relationships of the included genera. Morphology and habitat Mesoraphidiidae are similar in overall appearance to modern snakefly species, having an elongated prothorax, giving a snake-like profile and from which the common name snakefly is derived. The family was likely tree-dwelling by nature, with larvae being active predators in trunks and branches. Female mesoraphidiids, where known and complete enough, have a long and densely annultated ovipositor which would have been used to lay eggs in crevices of bark. The family was restricted to the Northern Hemisphere, living in the warm temperate and paratropical forest belt that covered portions of Eurasia and North America. History and classification As currently described, Mesoraphidiidae contains twenty-five genera, though several of the included genera were previously placed into separate families. As noted by G√ºnter Bechly and Karin Wolf-Schwenninger in 2011, the defining characteristic shared by all members of the family is the placement of the forewings m1, m2 and m3 cells in a triangular pattern. The genera Alloraphidia, Archeraphidia, and Pararaphidia were formerly placed into the family Alloraphidiidae. When reviewing the snakefly fossil record in 2002, paleoentomologist Michael S. Engel noted the lack of convincing distinctions between the two families, but tentatively retained the separation. In the same paper Engel moved the genera Huaxiaraphidia, Jilinoraphidia, and Sinoraphidia into Mesoraphidiidae and placed the monotypic families Huaxiaraphidiidae, Jilinoraphidiidae and Sinoraphidiidae as synonyms of Mesoraphidiidae. Engel did not give an explanation for the synonymizing of Huaxiaraphidiidae other than noting that the genus Huaxiaraphidia might be a synonym of Mesoraphidia and the type specimens should be reexamined. Similarly Engel did not give a specific explanation for the synonymy of Sinoraphidiidae beyond noting the poor type description of Sinoraphidia and a need to reexamine the type specimens. The creation of Jilinoraphidiidae was based on the apparent lack of crossveins in the forewings of the type specimen. However, Engel notes the lack of crossveins is due to the incomplete nature of the specimen, as there are several major longitudinal veins that show missing sections due to lack of preservation. The overall morphology and features of Jilinoraphidia are consistent with the other mesoraphidiids. Alloraphidiidae was reranked by Bechly and Wolf-Schwenninger as subfamily Alloraphidiinae within Mesoraphidiidae based on the based on the shared characters of the two groups. The subfamily can be distinguished from other mesoraphidiids by presence of a short stigma with a single cross-vein and the forewing possessing triple branching of the CuA, R and M veins. The genus Caloraphidia was described by Ren in 1997 but was later suggested to be a synonym of Mesoraphidia. When first described the genera Ororaphidia and Styporaphidia were not placed into a specific family when first described in 2008. They stayed unplaced until the 2011 paper by Bechly and Wolf-Schwenninger who grouped them, along with the reinstated Caloraphidia, into Mesoraphidiidae as the subfamily Ororaphidiinae. Ororaphidiinae was delineated as the genera that have a long pterostigma with a notably diffuse margin at its base. The remaining genera of the family were placed into a third subfamily, Mesoraphidiinae, all with the shared character of a Sc vein which ends about midway towards the wingtip and a pterostigma that does not have any crossveins. Within the Mesoraphidiinae, four of the genera were grouped into the tribe Nanoraphidiini. Cantabroraphidia, Grimaldiraphidia, Lebanoraphidia and the type genus Nanoraphidia share a group of distinct traits such as their overall minute size, the postorbital region of the head is shortened and the Rs vein in the wing with one or no forks. The genera described by P√©rez-de la Fuente et al in 2012 were not placed into any of the subfamilies or tribes erected by Bechly and Wolf-Schwenninger. This was due to P√©rez-de la Fuente et al not feeling there is enough of evidence for the monophyletic nature of the groupings. =Taxonomy= Burmoraphidia reni Dolichoraphidia engeli Necroraphidia arcuata Rhynchoraphidia burmana Styporaphidia? hispanica Mesoraphidiidae as grouped according to Engel 2002 with updates according to Bechly and Wolf-Schwenninger, 2011 and Ricardo P√©rez-de la Fuente et al (2012): :Family Mesoraphidiidae ::Subfamily Alloraphidiinae :::Genus Alloraphidia Carpenter, 1967 (Upper Jurassic-Middle Cretaceous; Canada, China, Mongolia, Russia) :::Genus Archeraphidia Ponomarenko, 1988 (Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous; Russia, Mongolia) :::Genus Pararaphidia Willmann, 1994 (Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous; Russia, Mongolia) ::Subfamily Mesoraphidiinae :::Genus Baisoraphidia Ponomarenko, 1993 (Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous; Russia) :::Genus Cretinocellia Ponomarenko, 1988 (Lower Cretaceous; Mongolia) :::Genus Huaxiaraphidia Hong, 1992 (Lower Cretaceous; China) :::Genus Jilinoraphidia Hong & Chang, 1989 (Lower Cretaceous; China) :::Genus Kezuoraphidia Willmann, 1994 (Lower Cretaceous; China) :::Genus Mesoraphidia Martynov, 1925 (Upper Jurassic-Upper Cretaceous; China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, United States) :::Genus Proraphidia Martynova, 1947 (Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous; England, Kazakhstan, Spain) :::Genus Siboptera Ponomarenko, 1993 (Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous; China, Russia) :::Genus Sinoraphidia Hong, 1982 (Upper Jurassic; China) :::Genus Xuraphidia Hong, 1992 (Lower Cretaceous; China) :::Genus Yanoraphidia Ren, 1995 (Cretaceous) :::Tribe Nanoraphidiini ::::Genus Burmoraphidia Liu, Lu & Zhang, 2016 (Cenomanian; Myanmar) ::::Genus Cantabroraphidia P√©rez-de la Fuente, Nel, Pe√±alver & Delcl√≤s, 2010 (Albian; Spain) ::::Genus Dolichoraphidia Liu, Lu & Zhang, 2016 (Cenomanian; Myanmar) ::::Genus Grimaldiraphidia Bechly & Wolf- Schwenninger, 2011 (Turonian, New Jersey, United States) ::::Genus Nanoraphidia Engel, 2002 (Cenomanian; Myanmar) ::::Genus Lebanoraphidia Bechly & Wolf-Schwenninger, 2011 (Neocomian, Lebanon) ::::Genus Rhynchoraphidia Liu, Lu & Zhang, 2016 (Cenomanian; Myanmar) ::Subfamily Ororaphidiinae :::Genus Caloraphidia Ren, 1997 (Cretaceous, China) :::Genus Ororaphidia Engel & Ren 2008 (Middle Jurassic; China) :::Genus Styporaphidia Engel & Ren 2008 (Middle Jurassic; China) ::Subfamily \\"incertae sedis\\" :::Genus Alavaraphidia P√©rez-de la Fuente, Pe√±alver, Delcl√≤s & Engel, 2012 (Albian, Spain) :::Genus Amarantoraphidia P√©rez-de la Fuente, Pe√±alver, Delcl√≤s & Engel, 2012 (Albian, Spain) :::Genus Iberoraphidia Jepson, Ansorge & Jarzembowski, 2011 (Cretaceous) :::Genus Necroraphidia P√©rez-de la Fuente, Pe√±alver, Delcl√≤s & Engel, 2012 (Albian, Spain) References Category:Raphidioptera Category:Cretaceous insects Category:Jurassic insects Category:Jurassic insects of Asia Category:Cretaceous insects of Asia Category:Jurassic first appearances Category:Extinct insect families ","title":"Mesoraphidiidae"},{"id":"36716664","text":"The Laredo World Trade Port of Entry is located at the World Trade International Bridge (sometimes referred to as \\"Bridge IV\\").

Lamon accompanied Lincoln to Washington and served as the President's main bodyguard during the war, thwarting several assassination attempts while holding the post of US Marshal. Lincoln sent Lamon to Richmond, Virginia, on Reconstruction business a few days before April 14, 1865, the day that John Wilkes Booth assassinated the President. The film was shot on a green screen stage, using the CineCollage technique invented by the director Salvador Litvak to create interior and exterior locations. Actors, extras, furniture, and props were filmed and combined with period photographs via the CineCollage process, which relied on off-the-shelf visual effects tools. The end result was a stylized look that reflects the movie's narrative structure, which involves Lamon's personal recollections of his friend. This was the first time such a technique was used to create an entire feature film. The film released on February 13, 2013.Saving Lincoln (2013) IMDb Plot Director Salvador Litvak and his writing partner, Nina Davidovich Litvak, based their screenplay on their extensive research into Lincoln's friendship with Lamon. Saving Lincoln charts their relationship from their initial meeting to Lincoln's Presidency. Lamon was a tall, boisterous Southerner who liked to drink whiskey, tell jokes and stories, play the banjo, and wrestle. Despite some pronounced differences between the two men, they shared a fondness for telling jokes and stories, and both felt slavery should be eliminated. Lamon often served as Lincoln's private confidant. The movie jumps from their initial meeting to Lincoln's presidency and the repeated attempts that were made on his life. Many well- known incidents are recounted, including the plot to kill Lincoln in Maryland, while he was traveling to Washington, D.C. after his first election ‚Äì Lamon worked with Allan Pinkerton, who founded the famous Pinkerton Detective Agency, to thwart that plan. Other events include the time a bullet went through Lincoln's hat while he was riding his horse late one evening ‚Äì he blamed it on a hunter firing an errant shot, but Lamon saw it as a sign that Lincoln was in mortal danger and needed even tighter security. Lamon was said to sometimes sleep by Lincoln's bedroom door, a striking image that appears in the film. Themes in the story involve Lincoln's anguish over Civil War casualties, his conflicts with members of his cabinet, and the death of the Lincolns' son Willie, which drove Mary Todd Lincoln to the depths of despair. Such situations complicate Lamon's efforts to keep Lincoln safe.

Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi convened the assembly in April; he sought a royal prerogative giving him the right to dismiss the parliament, providing that new elections were held to form a new parliament. He also specified a method for future amendments to the Constitution. The amendments were made in May 1949 by unanimous vote of the Constituent Assembly. During the previous year, the Shah had been considering changes to the Constitution as part of his various plans to increase the power of the monarchy. He was advised against this action by British and American diplomats who thought it unwise to unbalance the separation of powers. On 4 February 1949, an assassin shot at the Shah, two bullets wounding him. That evening, the government declared martial law and a special session of parliament imposed harsh measures against the Shah's political enemies. The assassin was suspected of being connected to the religious fundamentalist group Fada'iyan-e Islam (Martyrs for Islam, or Devotees of Islam), and loosely associated with the communist-leaning Tudeh Party of Iran. The parliament outlawed the Tudeh Party and had its leaders arrested. The Shah sent pragmatic Ayatollah Abol- Ghasem Kashani to exile‚Äîhe had formed a strategic alliance with the Fada'iyan. In an atmosphere of national sympathy for the monarchy, the Shah called for a constituent assembly to make amendments to the Constitution, to give him more power. He selected the constituent assembly members from his supporters. He also increased his pressure for the formation of the Senate of Iran, an upper house of parliament that had been written into the constitution in 1906 but never formed. The Senate was expected to favor the Shah. Background In 1906 during the drafting of the first Persian Constitution, a bicameral parliament was agreed upon in order to obtain royal approval from Mozaffar ad- Din Shah Qajar. The shah was to appoint half of the 60 members of the upper house, the Senate. The other half of the Senate was to be elected by a two- stage process. The shah expected to be able to control legislation by influencing the Senate. Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar signed the Constitution at the end of December 1906 but died unexpectedly of a heart attack a few days later. Radical politicians and other constitutional delegates did not want a Senate, and after the shah died no action was taken to form one. In mid-1907, the Anjumans of the Mujahidin, a group of workers, artisans and peasants, called for much wider voting rights for men, and they expressed a wish that the Senate never be formed because it would make the nobility more powerful.Afary 1996, pp. 84‚Äì86 The Constitution allowed for a board of ulama (Islamic scholars) who would oversee decisions made by the parliament. The ulama were to be given veto power over legislation. Ayatollah Mirza Sayyed Mohammad Tabatabai was one of those who influenced the composition and adoption of the 1906 Constitution, but he never insisted upon the formation of the board of ulama. Rather, the wishes of the ulama were usually voiced by several members of the Majlis. Ever since assuming the throne in 1941, the young Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had been working to increase his power. He wanted more weapons and men for the military, which he controlled, and he wanted financial aid from the US. In September 1948, he sent National Bank director Abolhassan Ebtehaj to the US to ask the government of Harry S. Truman for military aid or financial support, and to present the idea that the Shah would activate the Senate. Ebtehaj disclosed the Shah's wish to change the Constitution so that he could dismiss an uncooperative parliament and authorize new elections. The US State Department signaled Ambassador John Cooper Wiley to meet with the Shah to relay Truman's view that the US saw no need for \\"constitutional reform\\" since the Shah directed Iran's outward- looking affairs of defense and foreign policy; the US represented that the Shah was not supposed to be in charge of internal politics. This message was affirmed by British Ambassador John Le Rougetel who, seeking stability in Iran's oil industry and continued influence in Iran's parliament, said the UK also advised caution with regard to changes in Iran's constitution. The US State Department prepared a report in January 1949 describing the goal of US diplomacy in Iran as the prevention of any widening of Soviet influence. To that end, the Shah was seen as the most reliable bulwark against Communist aggression in Iran. He was invited to come visit Truman to discuss mutual concerns.Blake 2004, p. 50 1949 =Assassination attempt= On 4 February 1949, the Shah visited the Faculty of Law and Political Science at the University of Tehran, a symbol of secular success against the former monopoly of Islamic scholars who had previously controlled all aspects of the judicial branch of government. The Shah's visit was a celebration of the law school's anniversary. As the Shah walked from his limousine to the school steps a little after 1 pm, Nasser Fakhrarai approached him from the press area and fired a revolver. The first shot missed but the Shah's guards dropped and took cover, failing to protect him. Despite the lack of interference, the second and third shots also missed. The fourth bullet pierced the Shah's lip and cheek, knocking out some front teeth. The fifth bullet wounded his shoulder. When the gun jammed on the sixth round, Fakhrarai ran to escape. He was stopped by soldiers who quickly killed him with rifle butts and point-blank shots.Milani 2012, pp. 131‚Äì133 At 7 pm from the hospital, the Shah spoke by radio to the country, thanking them for their support. A photo of him dressed in a hospital gown with his cheek in a bandage was published the next day in the newspapers, showing his stoicism. President Truman sent the Shah a note wishing a quick return to good health. The assassin Fakhrarai was found with a journalist's press card showing that he worked for Parcham-e Islam (The Banner of Islam, or Flag of Islam), a religious newspaper opposed to secularism, and that he paid dues to the journalist's labor union loosely associated with the Tudeh Party. He had been posing as a photographer, hiding the gun in the camera case. Anxious to blame the Communists, the Shah seized the opportunity to declare a conspiracy of religious and Communist radicals, and he decreed martial law. He ordered an emergency session of the Majlis the same night he was shot. Through this session he suppressed his political opposition, including what would prove an ineffective ban on the Tudeh Party. The Shah ordered the closure of newspapers critical of his policies, and for treasonous activities he arrested 28 Tudeh leaders including the most prominent members of the Central Council of United Trade Unions (CCUTU). Mosaddegh was briefly confined to house arrest, and because the Fada'iyan were suspected, Kashani was exiled to Lebanon. Later it was determined that Fakhrarai had been planning the assassination alone for three years and had twice attempted it, failing to get close enough each time. The revolver had been given to him by Abdullah Arghani, a childhood friend who was a more radical member of the Tudeh Party, and was sympathetic to Fakhrarai's assassination plan. The press card had been forged.Milani 2012, pp. 133‚Äì134 =Constitutional changes= Following the assassination attempt, there was an atmosphere of sympathy expressed by the people of Iran for the Shah. The Shah used this to his advantage to promote his goal of increasing the power of the monarchy. On 17 February 1949, the Majlis passed the Shah's Seven Year Plan, an economic program that had its roots in an economic council of 1946 and a Supreme Planning Board formed in November 1947. The Seven Year Plan was intended to be an autonomous body, independent of political forces, but the Shah saw it as a vehicle for land reform measures that would reinforce his power. With 25% of its monies earmarked for helping to fight poverty in agrarian Iran, the Shah felt that the Seven Year Plan would make the disaffected rural poor more resistant to Soviet influence. Others thought that so much emphasis on agriculture would prevent Iran from growing out of its traditional role as a resource \\"appendage\\" supplying more powerful countries. Before February 1949, the plan had proven unpopular with the Majlis who saw it as a diminution of their political influence. Despite the Majlis vote of approval, the plan was never to be implemented as intended. By May 1949, some 40% had already been dedicated to industrial bailouts as opposed to the 14.3% originally planned. Another 40% was put toward the completion of rail lines; the Shah's plans were not realized. As part of his effort to suppress religious radicals, the Shah asked Ayatollah Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi to rein in the more strident voices among the ulama. Borujerdi, Iran's senior Islamic scholar, believed in political quietism‚Äîthat the ulama should not intervene in politics. Borujerdi had already established a pragmatic realpolitik arrangement with the Shah: the secular political domain would peacefully coexist with the religious domain for the advancement of both. He called a religious conference to meet in the holy city of Qom beginning 20 February 1949. Borujerdi directed the 2,000 conference attendees to discuss whether the ulama should take part in political activity; after due consideration, the consensus was for continued quietism.Farsoun 1992, pp. 40‚Äì41 (The future Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was among those who argued unsuccessfully for political activism.) The ulama determined the punishment for violations of quietism would be excommunication. Even so, some of the more radical ulama stayed active, including the Fada'iyan, and Kashani, exerting his influence from exile. On 27 February 1949, the Majlis voted in support of the Shah's bill calling for a Constituent Assembly to re-examine the Constitution of 1906.Afkhami 2008, [p. 117 https://books.google.com/books?id=pTVSPmyvtkAC&pg;=PA117] In March, the Shah announced the convocation of this body and he raised the question of whether the Senate should be convened for the first time, as allowed for in 1906. To fill the Constituent Assembly, the Shah chose men who were friendly to his wishes. Seyyed Mohammad Sadiq Tabatabai, a veteran ally of the Pahlavi dynasty, was made leader. While the men were preparing to meet, the Shah pushed through laws against newspaper criticism of the royal family, and laws which changed crown land holdings from general ownership to ownership under his name alone. Former Prime Minister Ahmad Qavam, writing from exile in Paris, published an open letter to the Shah which was very critical of any change to the Constitution. Qavam compared the Shah negatively to the hated Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar, Iran's short-lived ruler who fought to reverse the democratic advances allowed by his father in 1906. Qavam said the current shah would create a political backlash if he tried to take more power‚Äîa prediction that later proved correct. Rather than respond personally, the Shah directed former prime minister Ebrahim Hakimi to publish a severe chastisement of Qavam, accusing him of treasonous collusion with the Soviets during the Iran crisis of 1946.Milani 2012, p. 137 The Shah forbid newspapers in Tehran to print Qavam's first letter and a response; only Hakimi's letter was printed. The Shah also took away the honorific title of hazrat-e ashraf (his noblest excellency) that he had conferred upon Qavam for the same diplomatic achievements that were now being called treason.Afkhami 2008, p. 99 Mosaddegh worked to secure the release of some of those who had been arrested, succeeding to free labor leader Taghi Fadakar. He was not successful with others of the labor activists who had been arrested or denounced for treason. Nineteen of these were sentenced by the Tehran Military Court to various prison terms on 23 April, and eight top leaders were sentenced to death on 18 May in absentia, including Communist labor organizer Reza Rousta.Ladjevardi 1985, p. 263 Seven of the condemned men were from the CCUTU. The Constituent Assembly met for three weeks beginning 21 April 1949. On 8 May 1949, they signed the major change to the Constitution: Article 48 was amended to give the Shah the right to dissolve parliament, both the Majlis lower house and the Senate upper house, following which he was required to arrange new elections such that a new parliament would be formed within three months of dismissing the old one. A minor change was made to the Constitution regarding the process by which future amendments were to be implemented. At the same time, the Majlis passed the Shah's bill to hold elections enabling the Senate to be formed. =Elections for the 16th Majlis= Legacy The Constitution as amended in 1949 remained unchanged until 1957 when the number of Majlis seats was increased by two, and the Shah was given the right to send financial legislation back to the Majlis for reconsideration. The 1963 Iranian constitutional referendum, was seen as an approval of the Shah's White Revolution program including women's right to vote and compulsory education of children. From 1950 through 1953, Mosaddegh sought to abolish the Senate; it was finally dissolved in early 1979 during the Iranian Revolution. A revolutionary Assembly of Experts met in June 1979 to establish an entirely new Constitution for the Islamic Republic of Iran, approved in the December 1979 Iranian constitutional referendum.

In the 1500s, a 6th- century image of the Madonna and Child was uncovered here, and led to the establishment of this church. The marble pulpit dates from 1677 to 1705.

The 515 Army Base Workshop is one of the eight Army workshops located across India. The headquarters, Base Workshop Group, is in Meerut. These workshops come under the Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers and employ an estimated 18,000 civilian workforce. The EME kept 97 per cent of the equipment in operationally fit condition during Operation Vijay. Task The unit was tasked in 2002 to build and complete flight trials of spares for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Searcher and the indigenously developed UAV Nishant. The workshop also manufactures spares of various kinds of equipment and weapon systems used by Indian Army such as missiles, tanks (T-55 and T-72), Infantry Combat Vehicles (BMP 1 and BMP 2), Artillery guns (130 mm FD Gun and 155 mm Bofors guns). The spare parts manufactured by the workshop were of critical importance and were extensively used during Operation Parakram. The workshop produces small range training simulator Drona, and has installed it at various naval establishments, units of the Indian Air Force, and Assam Rifles. It is a hi-tech electronic and software based equipment designed to sharpen the firing skills of soldiers. The workshop also manufactures hand grenades and small arms range training simulators for Indian Army, which are Designed by Simulator Development Division Secunderabad and TOT (Transfer of Technology) carried out by SDD. The workshop is undertaking indigenisation of spares required for mine-resistant vehicle Casspir, used in counter insurgency operations for transportation of troops. Besides, the EME has a Station Workshop, which provides repair and maintenance support to various Defence establishments located in Bengaluru and four Maintainability Advisory Groups (MAGs) with public sector undertakings. The MAGs act as a link between the Army and industries engaged in Defence production. They are BEL, ITI, HAL, and LRDE. The MAGs look into aspects related to maintainability during design development and in-service phase of equipment being introduced or in use in the Army. In August 2012, 515 Army Workshop was asked to double its production of Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGM) simulators from 11 to 23. The workshop, which started ATGM simulators production in 2008 to meet growing requirements of Indian Army, has produced over 143 simulators. Simulators are used for effective virtual simulation for day and night engagement with a wide choice of terrain, target and attack profiles. These simulators help perform evaluation of trainees and capabilities in engaging aerial targets without loss of life or expensive machinery.

In the speech, Obama stated, \\"Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business, you didn't build that.\\" The sentence \\"If you've got a business, you didn't build that\\" was publicized by his political opponents during the 2012 presidential campaign, as an attack by Obama on business and entrepreneurs.\\"Romney hammers 'you didn't build that' in new web ad\\", Fox News, July 19, 2012 The Obama campaign responded that the criticisms were taking the phrase out of context, and the word \\"that\\" in the phrase was referring to the construction of \\"roads and bridges\\" in the previous sentence. Fact-checking organizations reported that Obama's remarks were used out of context in order to criticize the president. The Washington Post commented that the president's remarks reflected the belief, common among Democrats, that successful citizens owed their success partly to public infrastructure and government spending, and that they should contribute to finance public goods. The Republican Party used the phrase to criticize Obama throughout the 2012 presidential campaign. Background In August 2011, while contemplating a run for the U.S. Senate, former White House financial reform adviser Elizabeth Warren gave a defense of progressive economic theory at an event in Andover, Massachusetts. On September 21, a video of Warren making the case for progressive economics received attention on the Internet and became a viral video. In the video, Warren aggressively rebuts the argument that asking the rich to pay more taxes is \\"class warfare\\",Elizabeth Warren speaking in Andover, Massachusetts, on Debt Crisis and Fair Taxation by making the claim that no one grew rich in America without depending on government services paid for by the rest of society. Warren said: Obama later echoed Warren's thoughts when he spoke in Roanoke, Virginia about how private businesses rely on government investments in infrastructure. In her victory speech on November 6, 2012, Elizabeth Warren made a callback, stating it had been \\"an amazing campaign, and let me be clear, I didn't build that, you built that.\\"Democrat Warren Tops Brown In Mass. Senate Race WBUR.org, November 6, 2012; accessed October 30, 2014. Speech On July 13, 2012, during a campaign swing through Virginia, Obama stopped in Roanoke to speak to supporters. In his remarks Obama noted that while he was willing to cut government waste, he would not gut investments that grow the economy or give tax breaks to millionaires like himself or Mitt Romney. Obama went on to say that rich people did not get rich solely due to their own talent and hard work, but that, to varying degrees, they owe some of their success to good fortune and the contributions of government. Obama said in this context: Obama then cited the funding of the G.I. Bill, the creation of the middle class, the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam, creation of the Internet, and landing on the moon as examples of what he was talking about. Campaign statements =Romney campaign= The following Monday, July 16, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney spoke about the \\"you didn't build that\\" statement in a campaign stump speech. The following day, Romney rebuffed Obama's statement in Pennsylvania by saying: This was followed by campaign events with small business owners in multiple states (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia, Ohio, Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Nevada); two small business owners who spoke at one of the campaign events in Florida have government contracts. A new part of the Romney campaign website was created, and merchandise related to the statement was produced. The second day of the 2012 Republican National Convention was themed \\"We Built It\\" as both a celebration of small businesses and an attack on Obama's comments. Salon, Political Wire, and a humor website later commented on the fact that the stadium where the GOP hosted the \\"We Built It\\" theme at the convention was constructed using 62% taxpayer financing. Country music singer Lane Turner also performed a song at the event inspired from the speech called \\"I Built It\\". =Obama campaign= On July 17, 2012, the Obama campaign stated that the statement was taken out of context, and that the phrase referred to \\"roads and bridges\\" from the previous sentence. As the statement gained traction, the campaign ran new ads in multiple states (Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, and Nevada) where the President directly countered Romney's claims. In the ad Obama says while looking directly at the camera: While speaking at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland, Oregon, on July 24, Obama rebuked the Romney campaign by saying: Response Although the remark was not initially seen as significant, it soon gained traction among Republicans, and was used as a hashtag on Twitter. The phrase was used by the Romney campaign to build a political meme. The Washington Post identified the quote in full in the Top 10 political quotes of 2012 in their article of December 28, 2012. =Conservative commentators= An opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal on July 17, 2012, stated that the speech is a \\"burst of ideological candor\\" and that the statement meant that \\"the self-made man is an illusion\\". In another Wall Street Journal piece, James Taranto wrote that \\"The president's remark was a direct attack on the principle of individual responsibility, the foundation of American freedom.\\" Later, Kimberley Strassel wrote that the portion of the speech that spoke about Obama's views on the relationship between business and government was similar to statements made by Massachusetts Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren and that the effect of the speech was to \\"suck away the president's momentum\\". In The Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin wrote that the statement showed that Obama \\"revealed a level of resentment toward the private sector that was startling, even to his critics\\", and that the speech reflects that \\"the anti-business assaults become the campaign. Meanwhile, his affection for government becomes a chip on his shoulder, prompting him to dare those private-sector wise guys to deny the centrality of government in their success.\\" Glenn Kessler later said that the Obama statement was taken out of context and that he was speaking about higher taxes for the wealthy, comparing individual initiative to the system of many people working to create supporting infrastructure. In The Atlantic, Andrew Cline wrote that what Obama said was an \\"enormous controversy ‚Äì a philosophical rewriting of the American story\\" and that \\"With his Roanoke speech, Obama turned Jefferson on his head. In Obama's formulation, government is not a tool for the people's use, but the very foundation upon which all of American prosperity is built. Government is not dependent upon the people; the people are dependent upon the government.\\" This, Cline writes, is fundamentally non-Jeffersonian. Earlier in the same publication, Clive Crook wrote that Obama's statements did not mean what his critics wrote they meant, but that the caricature resonates due to it being recognizable as part of his theme of the \\"rich aren't paying their fair share\\". Jonah Goldberg, in the National Review, wrote that Obama's \\"gaffe\\" was at best truism, and the reason for Obama's supporters attacking others, for taking Obama's words and progressive roots seriously, is because they do not portray Obama as a pragmatist and a moderate. Guy Benson, on Townhall.com, wrote that the Romney campaign did not take Obama's words out of context since \\"Obama essentially posits that no private or individual success is possible in America without the government's help.\\" Rachael Larimore, in Slate, wrote that it didn't matter what Obama meant to say, as conservatives heard \\"You didn't get credit for your hard work\\", and even with the context of the entire speech, the reaction would be largely the same. More importantly, it damaged his relations with small-business owners. Rush Limbaugh commented that business owners did build the roads and bridges through their taxes, and that Obama wants to socialize private profit. Mark Levin, in reaction to the speech, said that Obama was \\"disrespecting the American people\\" and that \\"he despises the capitalist system\\". Josh Barro, in Bloomberg, wrote that Obama's speech was needlessly insulting, and that the statement resonated badly with people of all income levels. =Liberal commentators= In researching the 2002 Winter Olympics, NBC News' Domenico Montanaro posited that Romney had made a similar statement during his speech during those games' opening ceremony, where he said: In The Huffington Post, Michael Smerconish wrote that the Romney campaign did take the words out of context, and that the message of the importance of social contracts was better worded by Warren. Nelson Davis, president of Nelson Davis Productions, rebuked the conservatives' take on what Obama had said in Roanoke, saying that the reason why the United States has become great is due to business and government working together. Keeping with the \\"You didn't build that\\" meme, Alan Colmes wrote that Romney will not have sewed his suit, would not have built the stage used during the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa Bay, Florida, and that his success at Bain Capital would not have been possible without government assistance. Anthony Gregory, of The Independent Institute, wrote that the implication of the speech was that the \\"state protects business interests so taxpayers have a partial claim on the wealth produced.\\" Michael Cohen writing for The Guardian stated that the Republicans' usage of the phrase exemplifies that they \\"not only toil in their own narrowly and misleadingly constructed world, but really are just making stuff up.\\" In the New York Magazine, Jonathan Chait wrote that Romney's use of the words from the Roanoke speech as a \\"plan of blatantly lying\\" about it, and the reason why it works is because of a \\"broader subtext\\" of the speech due to Obama not using his normal voice, but speaking with a \\"black dialect\\". In Bloomberg Businessweek, Charles Kenny of the Center for Global Development also criticized the Romney campaign for taking the word out of context, and went on to state that American businesses benefit from infrastructure, and other elements of the \\"system\\" that Obama was speaking about in the speech. Media Matters made several posts targeting Fox News, and other news sources that Media Matters claimed were using Obama's words out of context through \\"deceptive\\" editing. Ezra Klein, on The Rachel Maddow Show, said that the political statements made in the Roanoke speech were not particularly controversial, and that people rely on others and themselves. =Fact-checking organizations= FactCheck.org said that the Romney campaign and Republicans have used quotations from the speech out of context, failing to include Obama's remarks about how infrastructure and education promote business success. In an update to the post, responses from the Obama campaign were added, explaining the president's intended meanings of infrastructure and education. FactCheck.org said \\"We don't know what the president had in mind when he uttered those words, and his intent is not clear. Regardless, our conclusion is the same: Taking snippets of his speech ignores the larger context of the president's meaning that a business owner does not become successful 'on your own.'\\" Romney was commended, however, for acknowledging Obama's wider context in a July 17 campaign speech Romney gave criticizing Obama's \\"You didn't build that\\" remark. Politifact also criticized Romney advertisements, saying that the Romney campaign, \\"cherry-picked a quote that made it sound like Obama was dismissive of businesses when in fact he was making a point that success comes from the combination of 'individual initiative' and the fact that 'we do things together'\\", and that by doing so \\"Romney and his supporters have misled viewers and given a false impression.\\" =Comedic commentators= On The Daily Show, a news satire program, Jon Stewart said that the Romney campaign was centering its campaign on a grammatical misstep taken out of context; he additionally said that both campaigns are guilty of focusing on gaffes, though Romney had taken it \\"one giant step further\\". On The Colbert Report, another news satire program, Stephen Colbert attempted to demonstrate that he is the only one responsible for his show's success by doing a segment of the program as a one man show, using an iPhone, desk lamp, and a whiteboard. \\"It didn't go so well\\", Meredith Blake of the LA Times reported. On The Tonight Show, Jay Leno during his opening monologue made a play on Obama's statement in regards to unemployment. Additionally, the controversy created by the speech has become the subject of numerous editorial cartoons.

During each reconstruction, temporary pontoon bridges were built to accommodate traffic. The current bridge was completed in 1955. The construction of the Amistad Dam in 1969 has mitigated the effect of subsequent flooding conditions. It wasn't until 1976 that a second bridge was built to further connect the two cities.

The Treaty of Alliance was a simultaneous attempt to defuse the dangerous Cyprus dispute between Greece and Turkey. A major element of the treaty was its specification of the exact number of Greek and Turkish troops that could remain in the new Republic of Cyprus. Small numbers of troops were permitted to provide local defense: Greece was allowed 950 personnel, and Turkey was allowed 650. The treaty also stipulated the formation of a Cypriot National Guard which would include both Greek and Turkish recruits. A pledge to form a joint military headquarters among Greek, Turkish and Cypriot armed forces was included in the treaty, but the plan was never realised. The treaty was augmented by the concomitant Treaty of Guarantee (1960), signed by Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom.

The shifting and evolution of knowledge and concepts, were from: *Eduard Suess (alpine geology: theory of thrusting as a modification of the geosyncline hypothesis), ; *then to Alfred Wegener (continental drift), , ; *then to Arthur Holmes (a model with convection), ; *then to Felix Andries Vening Meinesz (gravity anomalies along the oceanic trenches implied that the crust was moving) and A.

Key: #a Gneiss, shist and so on, #b Jura, #c Cretaceous and #d Eocene; Walensee, Schaechental, Windgaelle and Finsteraarhorn. Actually, there were two main \\"schools of thought\\" that pushed plate tectonics forward: * The \\"alternative concepts to e.g. Harold Jeffreys group\\", James Hutton, Eduard Suess, Alfred Wegener, Alexander du Toit, Arthur Holmes and Felix Andries Vening Meinesz (together with J.H.F.

Escher and Ph.H. Kuenen) had more evidence that the established paradigm and the reality do not match. But as all geophysicists he could not really believe in crust motions in such a large scale and he knew Wegener's Continental drift hypothesis fate too. accumulated even more evidence, but he prudently introduced them as geopoetry, quote: \\"Little of brilliant summary remains pertinent when confronted by the relatively small but crucial amount of information collected in the intervening years. Like Umbgrove, I shall consider this paper an essay in geopoetry.\\" * The IAV/ IAVEI board (i.e., B.G. Escher and A. Rittmann) probably never dumped the idea that the South Atlantic is under extension. * And the anti-drifters were in a way right as well. Although convection would mix up the mantle and make it homogeneous. The seafloor cycle with subduction and upwelling is something between conduction and convection, it allows for its inhomogeneity in a quasi-steady state. The mantle and the continents are in a way passive, the heat sink of the earth is the seafloor. So that the heat generated in the earth gets neutralised. Wegener's continental drift hypotheses is a logical consequence of: the theory of thrusting (alpine geology), the isostasy, the continents forms resulting from the supercontinent Gondwana break up, the past and present-day life forms on both sides of the Gondwana continent margins, and the Permo-Carboniferous moraine deposits in South Gondwana. =Graphics= Plate tectonics map, Digital Tectonic Activity MapThe Digital Tectonic Activity Map (DTAM) was produced by Paul Lowman and colleagues at NASA GSFC, 1998.

Biography Bartolom√© de la Cueva y Toledo was born in Cu√©llar on 24 August 1499, the son of Francisco Fern√°ndez de la Cueva, 2nd Duke of Alburquerque and his wife Francisca de Toledo. As a young man, before he took Holy Orders, he had an illegitimate son, Bartolom√© de la Cueva. Following his ordination, he was a cleric in the Diocese of Segovia, and a canon of the cathedral chapter of Toledo Cathedral. He also worked for the Apostolic See in Spain. In 1525, he and his brother Luis accompanied Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor during the emperor's visit to Italy. Cardinal de la Cueva did not participate in the Council of Trent. He was a friend of Ignatius of Loyola, joining Loyola's Sociedad de la Gracia at Santa Marta al Collegio Romano in Rome in 1543. He was also the patron of the first Jesuit church build in Rome by Michelangelo in 1544. Pope Paul III made him a cardinal priest in the consistory of 19 December 1544. He received the red hat and the titular church of San Matteo in Via Merulana on 5 May 1546. As a cardinal, he often resided at the papal court in Rome. Charles V was annoyed that Pedro Pacheco, Bishop of Pamplona was not elevated to the cardinalate and he forbade the three Spaniards made cardinals on 19 December 1544 from wearing the cardinalate habit until Bishop Pacheco was also made a cardinal the next year. On 12 September 1548 he was named administrator of the see of Avellino e Frigento, holding this position until 10 March 1549. On the vigil Pentecost, 8 June 1549, he was consecrated as a bishop in Rome by Cardinal Juan √Ålvarez de Toledo. He participated in the papal conclave of 1549-50 that elected Pope Julius III. On 4 December 1551 he opted for the titular church of San Bartolomeo all'Isola. He served as Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals from 12 January 1554 to 7 January 1555. Cardinal de la Cueva participated in both the papal conclave of April 1555 that elected Pope Marcellus II and the papal conclave of May 1555 that elected Pope Paul IV. He opted for the titular church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme on 29 May 1555. From October 1558 to June 1559, he served as viceroy of the Kingdom of Naples. He was a participant in the papal conclave of 1559 that elected Pope Pius IV. The new pope appointed him to a commission of cardinals tasked with studying church reform in 1560. On 13 September 1560 he was promoted to the metropolitan see of Manfredonia. He died in the former Medici palace in Rome on 29 June 1562. He was initially buried in Nostra Signora del Sacro Cuore.

This presumption of guilt goes against a fundamental principle of justice‚Äîinnocent until proven guilty‚Äîand disproportionately burdens the average person who may not have the resources to defend himself in court and enables law enforcement officials to hold publishers of websites accountable for seditious, defamatory, or libellous postings even if they are not the actual authors of the content.Section 114A violates freedom of expression and is flawed as it presumes one is guilty until proven innocent, says Suhakam chief Hasmy Agam. Internet Blackout Day was also supported by media sites FreeMalaysiaToday, Malaysiakini, Digital News Asia, The Nut Graph, BFM 89.9, Merdeka Review, and party organ news sites Harakah Daily and Keadilan Daily. Background to the campaign The Internet Blackout Day is part of a campaign to call for the repeal of the new Section 114A of the Evidence Act 1950, otherwise known as Evidence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2012. It began on 31 May 2012, when the Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ) launched an online petition to call on the government to withdraw the Evidence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act. The petition, which received more than 3,300 signatures, was handed over to the Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister‚Äôs Department VK Liew in Parliament on 26 June 2012. The CIJ also organised a public forum on 12 June 2012, entitled ‚ÄòSection 114A Evidence Act: Crime- busting or Online Control?‚Äô with lawyer Foong Cheng Leong, online activist Jac SM Kee, and tech experts A. Asohan and Jeff Sandhu to discuss about the repercussions of the amendment. On 11 August 2012, the CIJ, along with the National Young Lawyers Committee, and Pusat Rakyat LoyarBurok co-hosted a discussion on legal implications of Section 114A with lawyers K. Shanmuga, Faisal Moideen, and Foong Cheng Leong and Member of Parliament and Deputy Higher Education Minister Saifuddin Abdullah.

By the time Derdowski emigrated to the United States in 1885, he had already studied for the Roman Catholic priesthood, been repeatedly incarcerated by the German authorities, and edited a newspaper in the city of Torun. At the time, however, Derdowski was better known as a poet. Within two years of reaching the United States he became editor of the Winona, Minnesota Polish-language newspaper Wiarus. In this role he gained a reputation as a strong voice for the Polish-American community, also known as Polonia. Life in Poland Monument to Hieronim Derdowski in Rumia, PolandGiven Derdowski's flair for storytelling, his own accounts of his youthful adventures should likely be taken with caution. He may or may not have run away to join the French Foreign Legion at age fifteen, or studied for the priesthood in Rome. But it is clear from Polish sources that young Hieronym was intended to become a priest and that he received in Chojnice and then Braniewo an appropriately rigorous education, which included both Polish and German.Jarosz Derdowski - pierwszy poeta kaszubski, kartuzy.info To judge from Derdowski's literary accomplishments he was an excellent, if not necessarily well-behaved student: the brilliant but incorrigibly roguish young student \\"Derda\\" who causes so much trouble in Book Three of Majkowski's epic The Life and Adventures of Remus is beyond doubt a representation of Derdowski, upon whom Majkowski also wrote a 1911 monograph. Between 1870 and 1876 Derdowski worked mostly at teaching jobs while continuing to write poetry. After an abortive trip to France in 1877‚Äì1878 he returned to Torun, where he edited the newspaper Gazeta Torunska from 1879 to 1882. His life after that was marked by wandering, poverty, and imprisonment in German jails until 1885, when personal and economic reasons convinced him to start a new life in the United States. Although he was obviously not beloved of the Prussian authorities, neither was he in danger of long-term incarceration.Leo M. Ochrymowycz, \\"Derdowski and Pacholski,\\" in Gerald J. Langowski (ed.) The Polish Heritage (Winona: 1981), pp.51-62, provides an exhaustive analysis of primary and secondary sources. Despite his straitened living circumstances, Derdowski produced his finest work while living in Poland.:csb:Hieronim Derdowsczi Highly learned and equally fluent in the Kashubian \\"vernacular\\" and the Polish \\"high tongue,\\" he contributed greatly to both the Kashubian and the Polish traditions. His 1880 satirical epic, O Panu Czorli≈Ñ≈õcim co do Pucka po sece jacho≈Ç (Mr. Czorlinsczi Goes To Puck To Buy Fishing Nets) is regarded as the beginning of Kashubian poetry.See Jerzy Treder and Cezary Obracht-Prondzy≈Ñski's chapter \\"Kashubian Literature: The Phenomenon, its History and its Social Dimension,\\" in Cezary Obracht-Prondzy≈Ñski and Tomasz Wicherkiewicz (eds), The Kashubs: Past and Present (Bern: Peter Lang, 2011), pp. 109-140. Other Kashubian-language works written before his emigration are Kaszubi pod Widnem (\\"The Kashubians by Widno,\\" 1883) and Jasiek na Knieji (\\"Johnny from the Forest,\\" 1884). Life in Winona Upon reaching the United States, Derdowski worked first for the Chicago socialist newspaper Gazeta Narodowa and then for the Pielgrzym Polski of Detroit.Rev. Waclaw Kruszka, Historya Polska w Ameryce, tom. V (Milwaukee, 1905), p. 5. At the invitation of Father Jan Romuald Byzewski, pastor of the Parish of Saint Stanislaus Kostka and (like Derdowski) a participant in the Kashubian diaspora, he came to Winona, Minnesota to edit Wiarus. Derdowski's arrival made Winona a major center of Polish-American intellectual life.Sister M. Teresa, \\"Polish Settlements in Minnesota, 1860-1900,\\" Polish American Studies, vol. 4, p. 67. Though Wiarus may have changed its affiliation back and forth between the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America and the Polish National Alliance, the force of his impassioned rhetoric never faltered. And even when Derdowski's voice was not appreciated, it was always heard: in Minnesota, in Chicago, on the East Coast, and even in the Old Country itself.Rev. Waclaw Kruszka, Historya Polska w Ameryce, tom. V (Milwaukee, 1905), p. 5. Although Wiarus was written in so-called \\"pure\\" Polish, Derdowski's literary achievements and presence in Winona contributed to its being known as the \\"Kashubian Capital of America.\\" Derdowski also involved himself in the affairs of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish. After Father Byzewski left in 1890, a series of pastors and assistant pastors served Saint Stanislaus, some of whom met with Derdowski's approval and some not. Tensions often rose, especially during the parish's rapid growth in the early 1890s and Derdowski was in the thick of things, more often than not fanning the flames.William L. Crozier, Gathering a People: The Diocese of Winona (Winona, 1989), p. 189-192. With the 1894 arrival of Father Jakub W.J. Pacholski as pastor, Saint Stanislaus returned to an even keel and Derdowski played a more settled role in the life of Winona's Kashubian community.Rev. Waclaw Kruszka, Historya Polska w Ameryce, tom. V (Milwaukee, 1905), p. 5. Sadly, Derdowski never fully recovered from an 1896 stroke, and the strain of providing for his wife, Joanna, and their two daughters also took its toll on his health. His death in 1902 was scarcely even noticed by the local Winona press. Joanna Derdowska continued operating Wiarus until 1915, when it was sold outside of the family, finally shutting down in 1919. Legacy Grave of Hieronim Derdowski, Saint Mary's Cemetery, Winona, MNHieronim Derdowski combined, both in his life and in his writing, his devotion to both of his heritages: Kashubian and Polish. On the death of the founder of Kaszubian literature, Dr. Florian Ceynowa, he famously stated Nie ma Kasz√´b bez Polonii, a bez Kasz√´b Pol≈õczi \\"No Kaszubia without Polonia, no Poland without Kaszubia.\\" This attitude he applied equally to both periods of his life: the Polish years and the American years. He supported the retention of old Kashubian ways, but considered that his native culture was viable only under the larger and more pervasive Polish culture; an educated Kashubian had also to be an educated Pole:Jerzy Treder,\\"The Kashubian Language and its Dialects: The Range of Use,\\" in Cezary Obracht-Prondzy≈Ñski and Tomasz Wicherkiewicz (eds), The Kashubs: Past and Present (Bern: Peter Lang, 2011), pp. 80-81. Derdowski further insisted that Kashubian Americans were obliged to learn and observe both Polish and Kashubian traditions while becoming solid citizens of their new country.Paul Libera, \\"Polish Settlers in Winona Minnesota\\" , Polish American Studies, 15 (1958): p. 7. Over the years, Derdowski's efforts have been honored and celebrated within his native land. His works were influential upon Dr. Aleksander Majkowskihttp://tyras.sweb.cz/doct/kaszslav.htm#_ftnref7 and the Society of Young Kashubians; they continue to receive considerable attention from Kashubian and Polish scholars today. A statue of him was erected in his native Wiele.

He was provost of D√∂m√∂s Chapter around 1156, and bishop of P√©cs between around 1162 and 1186. The medieval sculptures of the cathedral at P√©cs are dated to his period. Life The first record on Makar's life (a charter of 1156 by Archbishop Martyrius of Esztergom) refers to him as provost of the collegiate chapter at D√∂m√∂s. He was appointed bishop of P√©cs in the reign of King G√©za II of Hungary. However, Makar became one of the four prelates who assisted G√©za II's brother, Stephen IV against the late king's son, Stephen III. Stephen IV's claim to the throne was promoted by the Byzantine Empire, which may account for Makar's choice, his diocese being situated on the southern borders of Hungary. Nevertheless, Makar left Stephen IV's party, shortly after, since a charter Stephen III issued in the middle of 1163 listed him among the prelates witnessing the document. The first reference to \\"guest settlers\\" in P√©cs is connected to his period, because King B√©la III of Hungary confirmed a sale of a piece of land by the widow of the leader of the \\"guest settlers\\" in P√©cs. The architecture of the altar dedicated to the Holy Cross in the cathedral has clear analogies in the contemporary architecture in Milan, Parma and Padova, while suggests the presence of stonemasons from Lombardy.

The infantry and corps cavalry advanced from Haifa and Acre to capture the Mediterranean ports at Beirut and Tripoli between 29 September and 9 October. These captures enabled the inland pursuit to be supplied when the Desert Mounted Corps' 5th Cavalry Division resumed the pursuit on 5 October. The cavalry division occupied one after the other, Rayak, Homs, Hama. Meanwhile, Prince Feisal's Sherifial Force which advanced on the cavalry division's right flank, attacked and captured Aleppo during the night of 25/26 October after an unsuccessful daytime attack. The next day the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade charged a retreating column and attacked a rearguard during the Charge at Haritan near Haritan which was at first reinforced but subsequently withdrew further north. Following the victory at the Battle of Megiddo on 25 September the Yildirim Army Group was forced to withdraw towards Damascus. The commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force General Edmund Allenby ordered Lieutenant General Henry Chauvel's Desert Mounted Corps to pursue these retreating columns. Followed by the 5th Cavalry Division, the Australian Mounted Division pursuit took them via Kuneitra and the 4th Cavalry Division pursuit took them inland to the Hejaz railway where they joined forces with Prince Feisal's Sherifial Force after their captured Deraa. Several rearguards were attacked and captured at Irbid by the 4th Cavalry Division Jisr Benat Yakub, Kuneitra, Sa'sa', Kaukab, the Barda Gorge by the Australian Mounted Division and Kiswe by the 5th Cavalry Division. After Damascus was captured the remnant Yildirim Army Group were pursued along the road to Homs and attacked by light horsemen at the Charge at Khan Ayash. While the Yildirim Army Group was retreating back their lines of communication were shortened facilitating supply while Desert Mounted Corps was getting further away from their base and their lines of communication had to be extended. The pursuit north from Damascus began with the advance along the Mediterranean coast by the XXI Corps north from Haifa and Acre to capture the ports at Beirut and Tripoli through which supplies could be transported to support Desert Mounted Corps advance. While the Australian Mounted Division continued to garrison Damascus the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions continued the pursuit towards Rayak and Baalbek as the advance along the coast was progressing. From Baalbek the 4th Cavalry Division could not continue due to sickness and remained to garrison the area while the 5th Cavalry Division, was reorganised into two columns and reinforced by a number of armoured cars continued the pursuit with Prince Feisal's Sherifial Force covering their right flank to Homs and Hama. By 22 October the armoured cars were south of Aleppo with the 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade catching up on 25 October just before Sherifial forces captured Aleppo. Early in the morning of 26 October the 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade continued the pursuit to Haritan where they charged Ottoman rearguards which proved too strong. By that evening, the 14th Cavalry Brigade had arrived and the strong Ottoman rearguard withdrew as a result. On 27 October the Australian Mounted Division was ordered to advance to Aleppo. They had reached Homs, when the Armistice of Mudros was announced, ending the war in the Sinai and Palestine theatre of the First World War.  Background  In southern Lebanon lived four varieties of Christians; the Maronite, Greek Uniats, Greek and Syrian Orthodox (Jacobite) lived alongside many Protestants, Druzes and Metawala. In the Southern Bukaa Valley and on the western slope of Mount Hermon, were more Druses, while in the Bukaa, Metawala and Syrian Orthodox Christians lived. In the Northern Lebanon, besides the same sects of Christians as in the south, more Metawala and an exclusive sect of Shiahs, the Ismailiyah lived. North of Damascus many Syrian Christians lived, and to both the north and the south some Metawala.British Army EEF 1918 p. 61 Villages north to the Lake of Homs were Christian and Arab, while the city was mainly Moslem with a Christian minority of mainly Greek Orthodox. To the east of all these peoples, were the nomadic Bedouin Arabs of the Beni Khalid and Nueim tribes, who according to a British Army report came \\"from the steppe hills and desert east of Homs and Anti-Lebanon\\", to spend the summer in Bukaa.British Army EEF 1918 p. 65 Following the comprehensive success of the Battle of Megiddo, Sir Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) at the War Office encouraged Allenby with the idea that the EEF could do anything: \\"There is much talk here of the usual kind some saying you could go to Petrograd and some saying that all your force should now be transported to France, and some again who would like to see you march east to Baghdad!\\"Wilson to Allenby 24 September 1918 in Hughes 2004 p. 186 He continued: \\"Your success being so complete, I should like you to consider the possibility of a cavalry raid on Aleppo, to be supported by infantry or not as the situation developed and as opportunities offered.\\" He added that the War Cabinet was prepared to take full responsibility for any unsuccessful outcomes.Wilson to Allenby received 24 September 1918 in Woodward 2006 p. 203 The War Office desired a quick cavalry raid on Aleppo away. Allenby's EEF at Damascus was already away from its main supply base and he was prepared to advance only in stages as supply and geography dictated.Bruce 2002 pp. 248‚Äì9 However, the difficult problem of supplying even a small force as far north as Aleppo from base would need to be solved.Wavell 1968 p. 230 Before either Damascus or Beirut had been captured, Allenby explained to Wilson that a raid on Aleppo \\"did not seem feasible unless supported by large-scale military and naval operations at Alexandretta.\\"Allenby to Wilson, 25 September 1918 in Woodward 2006 pp. 203‚Äì4 Ottoman infantry column c 1917 many wearing Keffiyehs  Prelude  = Yildirim Army Group concentrate at Rayak = Otto Liman von Sanders Liman von Sanders had seen the Eighth Army destroyed and its headquarters dissolved and the loss of most of the Yildirim Army Group's artillery.Erickson 2001 p. 201 The surviving 300 German and Ottoman soldiers who had formed the Haifa garrison arrived at Beirut on 26 September and were ordered to continue on to Rayak.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 594 Liman ordered von Oppen's Asia Corps (formerly part of the Eighth Army) to withdraw by train from Deraa at 05:30 on 27 September; he was delayed nine hours by a break in the line long north of Deraa, to arrive at Damascus the following morning; travelling straight on to Rayak where he was to establish a defensive line.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 595 Liman von Sanders transferred his headquarters to Baalbek on 29 September and Mustapha Kemal Pasha, commander of the Seventh Army, arrived at Kiswe with his army's leading troops. He was also ordered to Rayak to take over command of that sector, Jemal Pasha, commander of the Fourth Army also took command of the Tiberias Group defending Damascus while Jevad Pasha and the Eighth Army staff had been sent back to Constantinople. The 146th Regiment was the last formation to leave Damascus on 30 September. After hearing the Barada Gorge was closed von Hammerstein left Damascus by the Homs road, following the III Corps, the 24th Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division to Rayak where even remnants of the 43rd Division of the Second Army which had not been involved in fighting, were \\"infected with panic.\\" About 19,000 Ottoman soldiers had retreated northwards by 1 October, no more than 4,000 of whom were equipped and able to fight. \\"Successive defeats in adverse conditions meant that their morale and physical condition were generally poor, they had no artillery support and transport was virtually non‚Äìexistent ... they were unlikely to be able to offer much solid resistance to a determined British cavalry force operating north of Damascus.\\" Bruce 2002 p. 248 Only von Oppen's force which had travelled by train to Rayak before the Barda Gorge was closed and the 146th Regiment marching to Homs remained \\"disciplined formations\\" by 2 October. = EEF advance from Haifa = Allenby's plan outlined to Henry Wilson, CIGS at the War Office on 25 September, included an advance to Beirut at the same time as the advance to Damascus: However, the 7th (Meerut) Division (XXI Corps) with the 102nd Brigade Royal Garrison Artillery and did not arrive at Haifa until 29 September while the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment which was attached, was at Acre. They were unable to leave until 3 October when the 54th (East Anglian) Division took over garrison duties in the Haifa area.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 563 The 7th (Meerut) Division began their march to Beirut in three columns.

The second column began work to improve this narrow track cut over the cliff face. It took three days to blast the rock and build a surface suitable for wheeled transport. Meanwhile, the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment comprising one squadron Duke of Lancashire Yeomanry and two squadrons of 1/1st Hertfordshire Yeomanry were able to advance without waiting for the road works to be completed. They moved quickly along the road to arrive in Tyre also known as Es Sur on 4 October.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 603 During the advance to Tyre they encountered \\"few if any Turkish troops.\\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 601 Three days supplies were delivered by sea to Tyre, for the three columns to pick up on their way north. By 6 October the leading column had entered Sidon also known as Saida, where more supplies arrived, again by ship.  Occupation of Beirut  7th (Meerut) Division at Nahr al-Kalb (Dog River) Beirut, a largely Christian city with a population of 190,000 before the war, was strategically important due to its \\"great port\\", located south of Nahr el Kelb (or Dog River).At the Nahr el Kelb/Dog River invaders from the Egyptian Rameses II, Babylonian, Assyrian Roman and Ottomans left an engraved record inscribes onto the cliffs (Commemorative stelae of Nahr el- Kalb). These were joined by World War I inscriptions. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 603] [Hall 1967 p. 101] The XXI Corps added an inscription reading \\"The XXI British Army Corps with Le Detachment Fran√ßais de Palestine et Syrie occupied Beirut and Tripoli October 1918 AD\\". See: National Archives of Australia The Ottoman 43rd Division which had arrived early in October had been assigned the defence of Beirut. The first British Empire forces to arrive at Beirut were an armoured car reconnaissance from Rayak or Zahle by the 5th Cavalry Division on 7 October. They found Ottoman forces had already evacuated the city and an Arab government under Shukri Pasha Ayubi had been installed. A French destroyer and five French vessels were also in Beirut harbour.Allenby report to War Office 8 October 1918 in Hughes 2004 p. 204 The XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment with attached infantry company and the 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery arrived at Beirut on 8 October. The city was occupied without opposition when 600 prisoners were captured. The remainder of the infantry division and artillery followed when the road enabled the movement of wheeled vehicles. Private Norman F. Rothon, a mule driver with the 13th Mountain Howitzer Battery, 8th Brigade RGA, 7th (Meerut) Division, arrived at Beirut on the evening of 9 October. He and his unit had marched since 19 September; of that total were marched between 8 and 9 October. Rothon wrote in his diary, \\"if I was asked how I felt when we arrived I should say like a cripple and fairly doubled up and I hope I shall never experience another march like it the men tramping along with hollow cheeks and staring eyes, nothing to eat but the awful Bouilli & Biscuits and lots of the men go without as their stomachs cannot stand the awful repetition (we have had 3 weeks of it). My inside yearns for some ordinary food & vegetables.\\"Rothon Diary 10 October 1918 in Woodward 2006 p. 204 10 October 1918, 2nd Battalion Black Watch (7th Meerut Division) arrive in Beirut after marched in 8 days from Haifa Lieutenant General E. S. Bulfin, commander of the XXI Corps, established his headquarters in the city's main hotel, to oversea devolution of the city's administration to the French following the terms of the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement. He appointed Colonel de Pi√©pape, commander of the infantry D√©tachment Fran√ßais de Palestine et de Syrie, military governor at Beirut. He also appointed French military governors to Sidon and Tyre. When detachments of French troops arrived from Haifa by sea to garrison the three towns, they found some unrest caused by disappointed Arab Sherifial representatives.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 604 The infantry D√©tachment Fran√ßais de Palestine et de Syrie arrived at Beirut on 20 October, and the cavalry Regiment Mixte de Marche de Palestine et Syrie, detached from the 5th Light Horse Brigade, arrived on 24 October.

The leading column was followed by the 19th Infantry Brigade Group commanded by Brigadier General W. S. Leslie which arrived on 18 October. The remainder of the 7th (Meerut) Division arrived not long after. Rothon arrived in Tripoli on 18 October, after a march over mountain passes and sand. \\"Felt absolutely done up when we got here and at times felt like lying down and giving in as I feel as if my very life blood is being drawn from me in these long marches, in addition to which we are only at half strength which means double work for us all.\\" He was hospitalised in Tripoli shortly after and was still there at the end of the month.Rothon Diary 18 October 1918 in Woodward 2006 p. 205 The 5th Cavalry Division was ordered on 9 October to advance to Homs, where they could be supplied overland, along the fairly good road from Tripoli, as a direct result of that town, with its small port of jetties \\"suitable for landing stores in fine weather\\", being occupied.Preston 1921 pp. 284‚Äì5Bruce 2002 p. 252 On 22 October a casualty clearing station was landed at Tripoli to evacuate 5th Cavalry Division sick and wounded.Downes 1938 p. 741  Pursuit from Damascus  = Yildirim Army Group withdraw from Rayak = After an RAF attack on Rayak, Liman von Sanders withdrew the Rayak force on 2 October sending most of his troops including Colonel von Oppen's Asia Corps under the command of Mustapha Kemal to Aleppo, to prepare a defence.Hill 1978 p. 188 This force retreated to Homs via Ba'albek on their way to Aleppo; the first place offering the possibility of a strong defence, while the remnant Fourth Army prepared a rearguard defence of Homs. The Seventh Army's III Corps' 1st and 11th Divisions and XX Corps and the 48th Infantry Division, were still intact and conducting a fighting retreat by 6 October.

The Nahr el Litani or Leontes river flowing south between the parallel ranges of the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon enters the sea between Tyre and Sidon. Along the valley cattle, sheep and goats grazed and barley and wheat were grown with oats in the north. The only breaks in the north-south Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountain ranges occur from Damascus to Beirut and from Homs to Tripoli.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 604‚Äì5 On 5 October the advance north was resumed although supply would be difficult.Downes 1938 pp. 735‚Äì6 Allenby anticipated capturing the ports of Beirut and Tripoli, which would improve supplying rations to Desert Mounted Corps. \\"Nevertheless his decision [to continue the pursuit] was born of rare ambition and resolution.\\"Gullett 1941 p. 776 It would be a \\"bold move\\" as the British Empire troops would be well beyond range of support from the rest of the EEF.Keogh 1955 p. 253 Allenby briefed Chauvel on his Aleppo campaign plans at Chauvel's new headquarters in a former Yilderim Army Group building in the south‚Äìwestern suburbs during his day-trip to Damascus on 3 October. The Australian Mounted Division commanded by H. W. Hodgson was to garrison Damascus, while the 5th Cavalry Division commanded by Major General H.J.M. MacAndrew and the 4th Cavalry Division commanded by Major General G. de S. Barrow advanced to Rayak northwest of Damascus, to establish a new forward line to stretch east to Beirut.Bruce 2002 pp. 249‚Äì51The 5th Cavalry Division has been described as including the 5th Mounted Brigade but only the 1/1st Gloucester Yeomanry from that brigade were in the 5th Cavalry Division [Woodward 2006 p. 206] [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 661, 667] AIF Heavy Artillery Group crossing the Leontes River during their march to Aleppo from Tripoli in February 1919 The 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions left Damascus together on 5 October without wheeled transport and guns which rejoined at Khan Meizelun from Damascus and above sea-level after passing through the city. The Sherwood Rangers regiment which had been on the lines of communication at Kuneitra rejoined the 14th Cavalry Brigade, 5th Cavalry Division.

On the march towards Shtora, \\"A violent storm, lasting several hours, burst as soon as bivouac was reached and lasted the greater part of the night. This did not improve matters as regards the malaria outbreak, which was by then almost at its height.\\"  Occupation of Rayak  They advanced next day to Rayak; towards the railway junction of the main railway from Constantinople with the railways from Beirut and Damascus which branched at Rayak away. Rayak was reported to be occupied by about 1,000 Ottoman and German soldiers.Gullett 1941 pp. 776‚Äì7Woodward 2006 p. 204 During the night of 5/6 October, a report was received that the Ottomans had withdrawn from Rayak.

The 14th Cavalry brigade also captured 177 prisoners and some guns when they occupied Zahle a few miles north of Rayak, also without opposition.  Beirut reconnaissance  On 7 October armoured cars attached to the 5th Cavalry Division made a reconnaissance to Beirut, without opposition being encountered. They arrived about noon to find Ottoman forces had withdrawn from the city. = Occupation of Baalbek = On 9 October Allenby ordered the continuation of their advance to Homs following the railway.

Maunsell described the scene in the following passage: \\"This was magnificent, very fertile, and with many fruit trees. It was also a great grain‚Äìgrowing area. There were many wine factories at Shtora. The slopes of the Lebanon were covered with vineyards. The Anti‚ÄìLebanon, that is the range on the Damascus side of the valley, are pretty bare and resemble the Indian Frontier. At Shtora the surplus horses were left behind. They far outnumbered the men and it was with the utmost difficulty that they could be moved about. One man was leading five horses in Jacob's Horse, and the British units had to drive animals like herds.\\" On 16 October, the 4th Cavalry Division arrived at Baalbek on the plain between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains, where the days were hot and the nights cool. Here was found a good supply of water and tibben (bhoosa), but the division was \\"immobilised by losses through sickness\\" when a particularly virulent epidemic of malaria (malignant tertian) and influenza suddenly broke out. The division evacuated almost 80 per cent of the troopers; 3,600 were sick of whom 400 died.The 4th Cavalry Division had been garrisoning Beisan and engaged in operations to cut the last remaining lines of retreat across the Jordan River north from Jisr ed Damieh. During this time it is possible they were struck by the same malarial attack that had afflicted those units of Chaytor's Force which had held the Jisr ed Damieh crossing. Allenby and Chauvel spent some days visiting the troopers while the division was at Ba'albek with a brigade at Lebwe.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 606 According to Maunsell, \\"the Middlesex Yeomanry were down to twenty-six officers and men, while Jacob's Horse had an average of twenty-five men per squadron only. The difficulty of looking after the horses can be imagined and we had to have numbers of Turk prisoners to help.\\" The 5th Cavalry Division began their advance to Aleppo on 20 October, when the 4th Cavalry Division, reduced to 1,200 through the effects of sickness, was to move north to garrison Homs.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 610‚Äì11 But Falls notes that it was unable to do so \\"still less to support the 5th in case of need at Aleppo.\\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 611 Thus, Maunsell writes, \\"the Great War, so far as the 4th Cavalry Division was concerned, was ended.\\"Maunsell 1936 p. 240  Reorganisation of 5th Cavalry Division  At Baalbek, General MacAndrew reorganised his 5th Cavalry Division into two columns; the lead unit Column \\"A\\" consisted of the divisional headquarters, 24 cars in three batteries of armoured cars, and three light car patrols armed with machine guns, supported by the 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade (less the Hyderabad Lancers on the line of communications).Preston 1921 p. 285The 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade, fielded by Indian Princely States, had seen service in the theatre since 1914; from the defence of the Suez Canal onwards including garrison duties defending the bridgehead on the Jordan River.

[Wavell p. 231] = 5th Cavalry Division and Sherifial Force pursuit = The 5th Cavalry Division had not been so badly affected by sickness and was able to continue the pursuit as it had garrisoned Afulah and Nazareth well away from the mosquito infested areas along the Jordan River. Nor were they involved in the fighting at Jisr Benat Yakub, when they were in reserve to the Australian Mounted Division.Blenkinsop 1925p. 242 Allenby now ordered the 5th Cavalry Division to advance to Homs while the 4th Cavalry Division, which barely had enough men to carry out normal camp duties, remained to garrison the Zahle- Rayak-Baalbek area. Model T Ford Utility manned by Australian soldiers and armed with Vickers .303 machine gun mounted on a tripod The 5th Cavalry Division was organised into two columns for the pursuit to Homs.

Chauvel ordered them to advance up the Nahr el Litani valley between the Lebanon and Anti Lebanon mountain ranges, while 1,500 regular Hejaz soldiers commanded by Nuri Bey part of the Sharif of Mecca's Sherifial Force commanded by Prince Feisal, covered the cavalry's right flank by advancing north along the main Damascus to Homs road.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 604‚Äì6 The leading column of the cavalry reached Lebwe on 13 October, El Qa'a on 14 October and El Quseir on 15 October a total of passing through the fertile plain of the Nahr el Litani valley where bread, meat and grain was easily requisitioned at each place.  Occupation of Homs  Homs, November 1918 The Fourth Army commanded by Djemal Kuchuk had been ordered to form a rearguard to hold Homs for as long as possible, while von Oppen's Asia Corps (formerly part of the Eighth Army) continued on to Aleppo where Mustapha Kemal and the remnants of his Seventh Army were preparing defenses. On 16 October the headquarters of the Fourth Army at Homs was encircled and captured although it had been reported for some days that Homs had been evacuated. The armoured cars, 13th Cavalry Brigade and Nuri Bey's Sherifial Force arrived in the city of 70,000 with its crusader castle, on 16 October. By then the 7th (Meerut) Division had captured Beirut and Tripoli on the Mediterranean coast, anticipated rearguards from fresh Ottoman reinforcements had not been encountered and the RAF reported Hama, north of Homs, unoccupied. On 18 October Allenby ordered Chauvel to prepare to push the 5th Cavalry Division north on 20 October and to capture Aleppo by 26 October. Allenby had ordered the 2nd Light Car Patrol and the 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery which had been attached to the 7th (Meerut) Division (XXI Corps) to join the 5th Cavalry Division at Homs.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 607, 610 Krak des Chevaliers overlooking Homs The 5th Cavalry Division's fighting strength of 2,500 included the strongest column of armoured cars so far employed in the theatre. These included the 2nd, 11th and 12th Light Armoured Motor Batteries and the 1st (Australian), 2nd and 7th Light Car Patrols.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 610 The 4th Cavalry Division was to advance to Homs in support. When Chauvel reported the 4th Cavalry Division unable to move, Allenby decided not to risk the 5th Cavalry Division against Aleppo . He considered the city too remote an objective, with the increasing threat of encountering effective rearguards the further north they rode, and he ordered the pursuit to stop at Hama.Bruce 2002 pp. 253‚Äì4  Occupation of Hama  Cutlack Map 9 from the Sea of Galilee to Alexandretta with the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountain ranges, rivers, the main roads and railways The remaining soldiers in the 48th Infantry Regiment which had been part of the 16th Division, Asia Corps (formerly Eighth Army) at the beginning of the Battle of Megiddo on 19 September,Erickson 2007 p. 149 set up a rearguard at Hama. However, the rearguard was eventually forced to withdraw on 19 October as Desert Mounted Corps approached. Allenby had ordered the 5th Cavalry Division to continue the pursuit from Homs 120 miles (190 km) north to Aleppo on 20 October, with the 4th Cavalry Division advancing to occupy Homs, in support.

Aftermath  General Wavell's figures of 75,000 prisoners and 360 guns captured by the EEF between 18 September and 31 October were also quoted in the Turkish official history of the campaign. In 38 days of fighting of Ottoman Empire territory had been occupied by the EEF along with more than 100,000 prisoners and unknown casualties.DiMarco 2008 p. 332Falls gives over 27,000 to 2 October; Gullett credits Australian Mounted alone with 31,335 to 2 October; Chauvel reported 48,826 caught by his Corps in September and 29,636 in October. Divisional counts in Desert Mounted Corps and Chaytor's Force reached 83,700. Taking into account the large numbers captured in Damascus and elsewhere who subsequently died or who were employed to do the work of sick members of the EEF, Chauvel put the total nearer 100,000 than the official figure of 75 000, which was the number counted at Ismailia. [Hills p. 190 note] According to Falls, \\"the thoroughness of the Turkish defeat is almost without a parallel in modern military history.\\" This successful campaign resulted from \\"careful planning and bold execution. Combined and coordinated use of artillery, infantry, the RAF and cavalry were all essential aspects of the plan. However, what transformed the battle from a successful penetration of the 8th Turkish army's front into a great battle of annihilation that ended in the total destruction of three armies was the adroit and bold use of cavalry ... by two cavalry generals, Allenby and Chauvel.\\"DiMarco 2008 p. 333 The EEF had suffered the loss of 782 killed and 4,179 wounded soldiers.DiMarco p. 332 Between 19 September and 31 October the casualties totalled 5,666; Desert Mounted Corps suffering 650 of these.

Falls writes, \\"the goal aimed at by France and Great Britain in their conduct in the East of a war unchained by German ambition is the complete and definite freedom of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks, and the establishment of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the initiative and free choice of the native population.\\"Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 608 At Versailles, however, France demanded the enforcement of the Sykes-Picot Agreement and the Arab zone was divided in two; the southern portion became the Transjordan with French Syria in the north.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 609 According to Bruce, \\"in Palestine it became clear that the price of a permanent imperial presence was likely to be high, as violence flared soon after the end of the war.\\" Anti-British and anti-Armenian demonstrations led Allenby to order Chauvel to occupy the towns of Marash, Urfa, Killis and Aintab and dismiss the Ottoman commander of the Sixth Army, Ali Ihsan. To carry out these orders required Desert Mounted Corps to move to Aleppo and be reinforced by an infantry brigade, but there was some delay in the remainder of the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions moving north and Allenby \\"went to Constantinople by battleship, interviewed the Turkish ministers for Foreign Affairs and the Army and demanded the acceptance of his conditions and the removal of Ali Ihsan without discussion ... his terms were accepted.\\" In the aftermath, conflict in the region continued. Bruce notes that \\"the conflicting claims of Jews and Arabs eventually led to the development of open warfare between them in 1937 and was to lead to the ending of the British mandate in 1948. The territorial claims of the two groups still remain unreconciled and their relationship continues to be characterized by sporadic violence and discord.\\"  Notes   Citations   References           * * Category:Conflicts in 1918 Category:1918 in Ottoman Syria Category:1918 in Mandatory Syria Category:Battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign Category:Battles of World War I involving Australia Category:Battles of World War I involving New Zealand Category:Battles of World War I involving the United Kingdom Category:Battles of World War I involving British India Category:Battles of World War I involving France Category:Battles of World War I involving the Ottoman Empire Category:Battles of World War I involving Germany Category:Middle Eastern theatre of World War I Category:September 1918 events Category:October 1918 events ","title":"Pursuit to Haritan"},{"id":"36717548","text":"The following is a list of programs broadcast on MundoMax, a defunct Spanish- language broadcast television network owned by the Colombian broadcaster RCN Televisi√≥n and aimed at adults between the ages of 18 and 34.

App.net provided their own web interface to the service, Alpha, which was used by some users. However, they encouraged use and development of third-party applications. History The name 'App.net' was previously used for a service that let app developers showcase their applications. On July 13, 2012, Mixed Media Labs announced that App.net would change its purpose to be an ad-free social networking platform. As designed, it was similar to Twitter, but with no advertising, instead relying on user and developer subscriptions. Mixed Media Labs began crowd funding with a goal of $500,000 and about 10,000 backers. They exceeded the goal by August 13, 2012, ultimately raising approximately $750,000, with over 11,000 backers. App.net launched annotations on September 1, 2012, allowing applications to attach arbitrary metadata to posts. This was intended to allow more complex features to be built using the App.net infrastructure. On October 1, 2012, App.net started an incentive program. They would divide a $20,000 monthly pool among participating developers based on application usage and user feedback. Mixed Media Labs' goal was to encourage developers to build on the platform. On November 29, 2012, App.net began a free-trial invitation program. Users could invite a friend to use App.net. If the friend accepts, they could use the service free for a month. On February 25, 2013, App.net became a freemium service. Users with a paid plan could invite people to get a free tier account with a few limitations. In May 2013, App.net hit 100,000 users. On November 21, 2013, App.net announced Broadcast, a way for users of the App.net service to send and receive push notifications about the things they care about. These push notifications are sent through the App.net app on iPhone or Android. As part of the freemium model Broadcast is free to members of the App.net service with channel analytics available to App.net users with a developer-tier account. On January 25, 2014, App.net launched Backer, described as a way to crowdfund features. The first project to use Backer originated from App.net itself, in which the company asked if they should accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for the paid tiers. Some of the details for Backer are: On May 6, 2014, the founders announced that subscription renewals had been so poor that there were no longer funds to retain development staff for App.net and future operations would be on a maintenance-only basis using contractors. On January 12, 2017, the founders announced that the platform App.net would be shut down on March 15, 2017. However, due to a significant number of user data export failures that deadline was extended until March 16, 2017. App.net finally ceased to operate as a social network at 2017-03-17-06:45UTC. The source code for App.net was made available on their Github Page.

His mother was Marie-Louise Schreyer, and his father was Gratien Savelli. His mother came from a musical family of traveling musicians who performed in Eastern Europe, who have performed in front of the Imperial Court of Russia. At the age of 8, Savelli was admitted to the National Conservatory of Music and Dramatic Art of Mulhouse. He later studied at the National Conservatory of Music (Basel), winning a first prize award at the age of 12. After graduating from the Basel conservatory, he studied under pianist Pierre Sancan, and was admitted to the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris (CNSMD). Career Following a series of concerts throughout the world, Savelli momentarily stopped his career for family reasons. It was during this time that he devoted himself to the influence of music on people, primarily on those who suffer. He embodies his research with the help of doctors, by the establishment of an emotional level, usable by anyone other than the musicians. During and after 2012, Jean Marc Savelli prepared his coming back of concerts devoted to Beethoven-Chopin- Liszt. He was expected back on the scene in 2013. In 2013, he released an original video clip, \\"Corse Classique\\", dedicated to Beethoven, Liszt, and Chopin.

(1995). The miner's flame light book, Flame Pub. Co., pp. 107 and 119. it was a leather apron that served to keep the seat of the trousers from wearing out when working or moving around the mine (Fahrung) as well as keeping out the cold and moisture when sitting. It also provided protection especially when entering inclined mineshafts. Another advantage was that it stabilised the internal organs from mechanical shock and vibration by acting as a sort of kidney belt. The miner's apron was a triangular or, more rarely, semi-circular piece of leather and was supported by the body belt. In Germany the design of the modern miner's apron is governed by DIN standard 23307 Ges√§√üleder f√ºr den Bergbau (Arschleder).  History  The mining apron was introduced to German mining regions in the 15th century from the Slovakian mining area around Schemnitz (Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica). Early illustrations of it are found on the title page of the \\"Little Mining Book\\" (Bergb√ºchlein) by Ulrich R√ºlein von Calw (1505) and on the miner's altar of St. Anne's Church in Annaberg (1521). Georgius Agricola wrote in this book De re metallica (1556): Permission to wear the miner's apron was only granted to miners and mining officials. Analogous to the hammer and chisel, it represented a unifying symbol of miners' status. Later, it was also worn outside work in decorative styles as part of the miner's uniform (Berghabit) or parade uniform (Paradeuniform) for miners' parades (Bergparaden). In events connected with mining customs, this device is also used for the so-called \\"leather jump\\" (Ledersprung), a form of miners' initiation ceremony in Austria.  Folk art and music  The apron of the miner is incorporated into the design of the wooden smoking figurines and nutcrackers made in the Ore Mountains. It has also made its way into the mining songs. Thus we read in the last stanza of the version of the mine foremen's song (Steigerlied) sung in the Ruhr and Saar:  Similar uses  In stunt kite flying the leather apron is used especially in power kiting or kite surfing using powered kites. The pilot sits on a leather apron that protects the seat of his trousers and is hauled by the kite over rough ground (e.g., pastureland).

Biography Jean de Foix was a Gascon noble in the service of the English. His parents were Gaston de Foix, captal de Buch (1412‚Äì1456), and Marguerite d'Albret, daughter of Arnaud Amanieu, Lord of Albret, and Marguerite de Bourbon (1344‚Äì1416). In 1446, like his father before him, John became a Knight in the Order of the Garter. He was active in the defence and subsequent recovery of the city of Bordeaux. Then on 17 July 1453 he and John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, fought the French forces at the Battle of Castillon. Talbot and a son were killed and Jean de Foix was taken prisoner. The French King Charles VII sent John de Foix to Taillebourg Castle where he was held prisoner by Olivier de Co√´tivy, Seneschal of Guyenne. John negotiated his ransom directly with Olivier de Co√´tivy and was released, after seven years on 18 January 1460, after promising to pay 23,850 √©cus. On his release he left France for England where he was captured in the Tower of London following the Battle of Northampton on 10 July 1460. He was placed in the custody of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, and returned with him to France. When King Charles VII died in July 1461, John de Foix still owed Olivier de Co√´tivy 18,000 √©cus, but the new King Louis XI of France, who profoundly hated everybody who had served his father, forced Olivier de Co√´tivy to cancel this debt. Jean de Foix now entered in the service of King Louis XI. He may have resigned the Order of the Garter in 1462, but the family continued to use the title 'Earl of Kendal' until the death of Henri Fran√ßois de Foix-Candalle (1640‚Äì1714), duc de Randan.

First source comes from pre 7th Century Old English, from the word 'stigol' meaning a steep ascent or from 'stigan' meaning to climb. The second source is from another Old English word 'stigel', a stile. Regardless of the source, this name was given to those who lived near these locations. Topographical surnames were some of the earliest created names. Names were originally based on what was seen around the area so those who gave names based their judgement on man-made features and natural habitat. Today, Steggles has evolved to a modern surname. The modern surnames now are Style(s), Stile(s), Stickel and Stegel(l). There are other genitive forms as well in Steggals, Stiggles, Stickel(l)s and Stickles.

The disease was first reported in 1970 by Leonard Langer and associates; they used the term parastremmatic from the Greek parastremma, or distorted limbs, to describe it. On X-rays, the disease is distinguished by a \\"flocky\\" or lace-like appearance to the bones. The disease is congenital, which means it is apparent at birth. It is caused by a mutation in the TRPV4 gene, located on chromosome 12 in humans. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.  Presentation  Parastremmatic dwarfism is apparent at birth, with affected infants usually being described as \\"stiff\\", or as \\"twisted dwarfs\\" when the skeletal deformities and appearance of dwarfism further present themselves. Skeletal deformities usually develop in the sixth to twelfth month of an infant's life. The deformities may be attributed to osteomalacia, a lack of bone mineralization. Parastremmatic Dwarfism is further characterised by short stature, bowing of extremeties and further neuroskeletal dysplasia.  Genetics  The location of genes on chromosome 12 Parastremmatic dwarfism is caused by a missense mutation (where one amino acid is replaced by another in a gene sequence) in the TRPV4 gene, located on the long arm of human chromosome 12, at 12q24.11. The mutation is in exon 11 of the gene, and is labelled R594H; this means that the codon (the code for an amino acid molecule) for arginine was erroneously substituted by a codon for histidine at position 594 in that exon. This same mutation in the TRVP4 gene is known to cause the Kozlowski type of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. Parastremmatic dwarfism is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that the defective gene responsible for the disease is located on an autosome (chromosome 12 is an autosome), and one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who also has the disorder. Parastremmatic Dwarfism results from mutations within the N-ankyrin domain of TRPV4, which has been identified to be involved in regulation of the TRPV4 calcium ion channel. This influx of calicum may be responsible for neuronal cell death, as well as affecting levels of circulating growth hormones. Parastremmatic Dwarfism is a very rare disorder, and as of 2011, only 5 people were diagnosed worldwide. As such, functional analysis has proved elusive at this time.

Ian was placed on Mike \\"Boogie\\"'s team. On Day 48, Ian won his first HoH competition. After that initial victory, he went on to win the rest of his eligible HoH competitions. With his win on finale night, he tied the record of the most HoHs in a season: four. On September 19, 2012, Terry won Big Brother 14 and the $500,000 prize after defeating Dan Gheesling, who was the winner of Big Brother 10 and one of the four returning coaches, by a vote of 6-1.

Sayyed Ahmad was the brother of Sayyed Mahmud Khan Barha Kundliwal. He gained the emperor's respect due to his bravery and valour. He joined the king's service along with his brother as part of the advance force sent to Gujarat. After the Ahmadabad victory, the king sent him in pursuit of the sons of Sher K. Fuladi who had gone to Idar. Though they moved swiftly, and entered the mountain defiles, many of their goods fell into the hands of the king's soldiers. Sayyed Ahmad returned to the king and did homage. Afterwards when Patan became the royal camp it was made over to Mirza Khan (Abdu-r-Rahim S. Bairam) and Sayyed Ahmad became governor (on account of Mirza's youth). In the same year Muhammad Hussain Mirza and Shah Mirza besieged Patan along with Sher Khan. Sayyed Ahmad Khan looked after the fortifications and defended the place. Later Khan Azim Koka approached with a large force and the Mirza's withdrew from the siege. During the Battle of Haldighati Sayyed Ahmad accompanied Raja Man Singh, Sayyed Hashim Barha, Raja Jaimal, Ghazi Khan and other well known warriors. Sayyed Ahmad commanded the army's right wing. In the 20th year of his reign he was sent with his nephews Sayyed Hashim Barha and Sayyed Qasim Barha to defeat the rebels connected with the Rana-who after the killing of Jalal K.

He was bishop of P√©cs from 1186 until his death in 1218, and ban of Croatia and Dalmatia between 1193 and 1194, thus he was the first prelate in the kingdom to parallelly held a secular office. Kal√°n's relationship with the monarch was tense in the reign of King Emeric who accused the bishop of incest but could never prove it. Although a part of the canons of Esztergom elected Kal√°n as archbishop in 1204, his election was not confirmed by the Holy See. Kal√°n died when planning to go on a crusade to the Holy Land. Life Kal√°n was born into a prominent family of the Kingdom of Hungary between around 1150 and 1155. The ancestral possessions of his family, the B√°r-Kal√°n kindred were located around B√°r in Baranya County, and around Esztergom. Although no information on his early years was recorded, the \\"refined style of the charters he issued\\" (L√°szl√≥ Koszta) point at his studies in foreign schools. Kal√°n worked for the royal court from the 1180s and promoted the separation of the royal chancellery from the royal chapel, being the latter supervised by the archbishops of Esztergom. A charter of 1181 alludes to him as \\"chancellor of the royal court\\" (aule regie cancellarius). Although he is mentioned as bishop of P√©cs in a charter of 1183, its reliability is highly suspectful. Therefore he seems to have become bishop in 1186. The pope also granted him the personal right to wear a pallium similarly to the archbishops. King B√©la III of Hungary appointed Kal√°n to administer Croatia and Dalmatia with the title of governor (gubernator) in 1193. In this office, Kal√°n was replaced by the king's eldest son, Emeric, which may suggest a strained relationship between the bishop and the monarch. The Cistercian chronicler, Alberic of Trois-Fontaines would even write that Kal√°n murdered B√©la III using a poisoned communion wafer in 1196. All the same, B√©la III's successor, Emeric accused, in 1203, the bishop not of murdering his father but of maintaining an illicit relationship with his own niece, but this accusation remained unproven. Kal√°n, along with all the other suffragan bishops of the archbishops of Esztergom, protested against the election of Archbishop John of Kalocsa to the see of Esztergom by its canons in 1204. They emphasized that Archbishop John had up to that time disputed the preeminent status of the see of Esztergom within the kingdom. The suffragan bishops convinced some canon in the cathedral chapter of Esztergom to change their mind and to elect Kal√°n archbishop. Now his opponent accused bishop Kal√°n of an incestuous relationship with his niece, but the investigation conducted by his five fellow bishops cleared him. All the same, Pope Innocent III decided the conflict over the archbishopric of Esztergom in favor of Kal√°n's opponent and confirmed John's election on October 5, 1205. Kal√°n passionately protected the interests of his diocese. He disputed that the Benedictine abbey of Dunaf√∂ldv√°r was exempt from his jurisdiction and sued its abbot before the pope, but the abbey remained directly submitted to the archbishops of Esztergom. He also submitted a formal complaint against the Cistercian abbey at Cik√°dor in the 1210s because the buying of vineyards in his diocese by the Cistercians who were exempt from tithe jeopardized his income. Upon his request Pope Innocent III formerly warned the Cistercians to moderate their acquisition of new properties. He seems to have set up the collegiate chapters at Po≈æega (now in Croatia), and a monastery for the Canons Regular at Irig (now in Serbia). The building of the cathedral at P√©cs was finished in his period, around 1200. In short time Kal√°n established a collegiate chapter dedicated to John the Baptist in front of the western facade of the new church. The cathedral chapter also began functioning as a \\"place of authentication\\" (locus credibilis) in Bishop Kal√°n's time. He was planning to visit the Holy Land, but his age prevented him from joining the crusade King Andrew II of Hungary organized in 1217. References * * Koszta, L√°szl√≥ (2009).

Each weeknight and on Sunday evenings a compilation of the general events in the House for the previous day are presented. All live shows are broadcast with a 30-second delay so that images or language that cannot be broadcast due to Australia's censorship laws can be cut. These programs add up to approximately 16 hours per week. Except for during its first season, Big Brother episodes screened each day except Saturday. Main shows = Opening Night = The Opening Night is the first episode of the Big Brother Australia series that introduces the new housemates and the House for that year. It is currently hosted by Sonia Kruger. Previously, it was hosted by Gretel Killeen from 2001‚Äì07, and Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O in 2008. In different seasons it ran under various titles such as Launch, In They Go and The Secret. = Daily Show = The Daily Show aired Monday - Friday at 7:00 pm ‚Äì 7:30 pm for all seasons of the series. It reported on the previous day's happenings inside the House, and was narrated by Mike Goldman. Later seasons of Big Brother added a Sunday edition of the Daily Show, which covered the preceding Friday and Saturday, which screened Sundays at 6:30 pm ‚Äì 7:30 pm. Occasionally, in various seasons of the series, the Daily Show episode would run to one hour, sometimes to accommodate a special event in the house. For the 2001 through to the 2007 seasons, on screen it simply carried the title Big Brother. For the 2008 season the on-screen title was shown as Big Brother: Daily Show. During the 2008 season the Monday evening installment was extended to a one-hour duration when the housemate nominations were incorporated into the episode. In 2012, the Daily Show aired from Tuesday - Thursday at 7:00 pm ‚Äì 8:00 pm and Friday at 7:00 pm ‚Äì 7:30 pm. Sunday and Monday did not include a Daily Show ‚Äì instead a recap of the day was merged into the Sunday and Monday live shows. = Eviction = Housemate evictions occur in a program titled Big Brother Live Eviction. The housemate who has attracted the most viewer votes to evict is evicted. The eviction shows are televised each Sunday night at 7:30 pm (Australian Eastern Standard Time). Actual events start a short time before 7:30 pm. Proceedings are conducted in an auditorium in front of a live audience at Dreamworld. These shows are broadcast live. In this show usually one housemate, but occasionally two, is evicted from the house, usually at around 7:45‚Äì8:00 pm. Shows that feature two evictions are called Double Eviction. The first Australian Double Eviction, described in advertising hyperbole as a \\"world first\\", took place during Big Brother 2002. Big Brother 2006 added the save vote, allowing viewers to vote to save a housemate as well as evict; in the final tally housemates' save votes are subtracted from their evict votes. The 2008 season introduced a new nomination and eviction process. For the 2008 season the public vote for which housemate to save from eviction. The three housemates with the fewest save votes are nominated for eviction. The housemates then vote to evict one of the three. From week five this new routine was abandoned the original eviction procedure reinstated: housemates nominate each other and viewers may vote only to evict those nominated. Big Brother 2012 changed the voting once again, getting viewers to save the nominees they want to stay in the house. They can only vote for those housemates that are up for nomination and the housemate with the fewest votes to save them are evicted. This voting process is also used in the current season, Big Brother 2013. In Big Brother 2004 after the eviction of Bree Amer, it was found the votes for that eviction had been incorrectly counted. Amer had not received the most eviction votes, and she took up the option of returning to the house the following Monday night. A special eviction was held on the following Thursday evening in which the housemate to actually receive the most votes, Wesley Denning, was evicted. A representative of Legion Interactive, the company that manages eviction votes and compiles the results, appeared on the second eviction show to explain how the error occurred. = Finale = The Big Brother Finale is a significant event conducted in front of an audience at Dreamworld and broadcast live on television. The usual series host presents the finale. The television presentation has been scheduled to run as long as three hours, sometimes running even longer. The 2007 season finale was extended by almost an hour due to a delay in finalising eviction vote tallies. In all Australian series the Finale features footage from the final day in the house, by which time there are only two housemates remaining, culminating in the announcement of the winner. Usually the runner-up leaves the house in the manner of an evicted housemate, and is interviewed by the host on stage. Later the winner is asked to leave the house, finally joining the host on stage. The final two housemates of Big Brother 2004, Big Brother 2005 and Big Brother 2007 left the House together, and were on stage when the winner of those seasons was announced. Big Brother 2006 had featured the original format where the winner is announced while the final two housemates are in the House, and they both left separately. Big Brother 2008 had the finalists on the stage with the hosts. Season 9 retained the original format but with three housemates. Previous housemates of the season sometimes put on a musical or dance performance. Sometimes the performance is set to popular music and is based on several of the tasks the housemates had participated in during the season. In 2006, Danielle Foote sang her single, while the other housemates did dance routines around her, using costumes and elements from various tasks of that season. The 2007 Finale was the last Big Brother program to be hosted by series host of seven years, Gretel Killeen. In 2008, the Finale was hosted by the replacement Big Brother hosts Kyle and Jackie O. The 2008 Finale featured a special dedication to past series as the 2008 season would be the last for the foreseeable future. Companion shows = Friday Night Live = Big Brother Friday Night Live is a live show based on Big Brother UKs spin-off Saturday Night Live hosted by Mike Goldman and former Big Brother 2004 housemates Ryan Fitzgerald and Bree Amer, showcasing a live housemate games competition conducted in an arena attached to the Big Brother compound every Friday evening. The housemate evicted the previous week joins the hosting panel. The show was introduced with Big Brother 2005, aired on Fridays at 7:30 p.m. The show was originally set to be hosted by just Goldman and Fitzgerald, with Amer appearing in the first episode as a guest to fill the third chair as an eviction hadn't taken place for an evictee to be present - but was brought back last minute for the second show when it felt like \\"it wasn't working\\" with just the duo. She then continued to appear weekly as a guest on a casual basis before becoming the third host for the eighth show onward. The winner of the overall games is rewarded with the following: # Becoming Head Of The House # Taking One Fellow Housemate Into The Strategy Room # Evicting A Fellow Housemate With Double Points # The power to change the nominated housemate lineup Friday Night Live returned for Big Brother 2006. A fourth prize was added for the winner, a \\"luckydip\\" type prize draw where they are presented with three boxes, each containing a prize, and may choose one box, not knowing what any of the boxes contains. The three boxes are themed on a specific country, and the three boxes featured a holiday to that country after the conclusion of the competition, a privilege that may be used within the house (such as laundry services or a special dinner), and a booby prize. Booby prizes have included a bow tie and a chunk of Camembert cheese. On one occasion the three boxes were replaced with a special prize where the winner was allowed to go on an excursion outside the Big Brother House to Tiger Island at Dreamworld, where they were treated to a feast and a tiger show. They then had the entire park to themselves for a night. The winner on this occasion was Gaelan, who invited Krystal to share in his prize. On a second occasion, the winner of Friday Night Live, Jamie, was given the four usual prizes, and a fifth \\"mystery prize\\". The prize involved Jamie and the person he invited to the Rewards Room, Chris, leaving the House to get a first go on FlowRider, a new ride at Dreamworld. For the Big Brother 2007 season Friday Night Live remained largely unchanged. For this season the prize boxes generally contained an overseas holiday, a large item such as expensive watches or a scooter, and a booby prize. But a twist in the power to change the nominations lineup made this a more valuable than ever prize for the winner of Friday Night Live in Big Brother 2007 as they were able to remove themselves altogether (if nominated) or another housemate from the nominees for that week, and replace them with another housemate, rather than in the last two series where the winner had the power to change nominations by deducting 3 points from a nominee. The Friday Night Live format was reused in the Network Ten spinoff series Friday Night Games which began in February 2006 and ended before Big Brother resumed for 2006. This weekly program is also filmed at Dreamworld, and features two teams of celebrities (who are joined by members of the public) to compete in a series of games. The program was again hosted by Goldman, Amer, and Fitzgerald. The 2008 season of Big Brother did not include a rewards room, instead allowing the winning housemate entry to the new \\"Strategy Room\\" with one other housemate of their choice. Due to the changes in the nomination and eviction process, the winner was able to save one housemate from eviction, and votes with double points during evictions. = UpLate = Big Brother: UpLate is a late-night show screened every weeknight throughout the Big Brother seasons in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and hosted by Mike Goldman. The show was first introduced with Big Brother 2003. The show aired at 11:15pm on Monday‚ÄîThursdays, 10:30pm on Fridays and 10:10 pm. Episodes usually had a duration between 60 and 120 minutes. The show features live footage from the House; interviews with evicted housemates; and brain teasers where viewers attempt to solve challenges such as word games, and may phone in for a chance to win up to $1000. An online stream was made available for the 2006 season at QuizTV.com.au specifically for viewers in states that do not receive UpLate live on television (i.e. South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory), enabling them to enter the competitions. It was possible for this stream to be viewed by those outside of Australia. An online stream was made available once more for the 2007 season. During the 2007 season of Big Brother a Sunday evening edition of the show was added. UpLate did not return for the 2008 season of Big Brother. = The Insider = The Insider was a panel-type show introduced for the 2003 season hosted by Tim Ferguson with additional gossip and discussion about the show. Frequently the week's evicted housemate would be one of the show's guests. = Big Brother's Big Mouth = Big Brother's Big Mouth is a panel show introduced for the 2008 season of the show, based on the Big Brother UK show of the same title. The show was hosted by Tony Squires and Rebecca Wilson with panelists Tom Gleeson and Tim Brunero. It also features evicted housemates. Big Mouth aired at 9.30pm each Monday night from 6 May 2008 to 23 May 2008. Due to a ratings decline it was moved to 10.00pm Monday starting 30 June 2008, with new series Mark Loves Sharon taking its original slot. Each week different former Australian housemates were guest panel members. There was a total of 11 one hour episodes. = Uncut / Adults Only = Big Brother: Uncut was a companion programme to Big Brother that showcased adult content from the House that was unsuitable for the early evening Daily Show. This mainly consisted of footage of the housemates showering, general risque behaviour, and discussions about sexual matters. The show aired for an hour each week including commercials and was hosted by Gretel Killeen. Uncut premiered on 23 July 2001 on Network Ten and was shown aired at 9:30 pm on Thursday nights. It later switched to 9:30 pm Monday nights, and then 9:40 pm Monday nights and was rated MA15+. During the fifth season the programme came under controversy after the viewing audience began to complain the content shown. Communications Minister Helen Coonon asked the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) to investigate whether Uncut complies with the TV industry's code of practise and to check whether current mechanisms are enough to deal with reality TV shows. Community groups complained to the industry watchdog about nudity and sexual acts that had gone to air in the uncut version of the show. Network Ten said it would cooperate with any investigation it was later found that the network breached the code of practice but no direct punishment was imposed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. For the sixth season Uncut was renamed to Big Brother: Adults Only with Gretel Killeen continuing to host. The ACMA required that footage be compiled in advance so it could be edited by censors to meet the MA15+ rating. Network Ten hired two censors and crew were trained in the restrictions of the MA15+ rating. Adults Only ended early after politicians warned Network Ten that its screening of the show could harm its push for media reforms. = Saturday = Big Brother Saturday was a one-hour long show aired on Saturday evenings during Big Brother 2001, with Gretel Killeen presenting an overview of press discussions of the series that week, interviews with fans by reporter Sami Lukis, and stories about the activities of evicted housemates. The show featured little actual footage originating from the Big Brother House itself. This show did not return after the first series, largely because Network Ten acquired the rights to televise Saturday night Australian Football League games after the first series of Big Brother ended, with these telecasts taking the show's timeslot. = Nominations = Big Brother Nominations was a one-hour special show that aired on Monday evenings after the Daily Show for the 2002, through to the 2007 seasons. In the first series of Big Brother Australia there was no special show for nominations; they were simply shown as a part of the Daily Show on Tuesday evening. In the first season of the series housemates did not have to give reasons for their nominations. Subsequent seasons added a special dedicated to the nomination process. This was usually pre-taped; in Big Brother 2005 the announcement of which housemates were nominated for eviction was presented live. For the first half of the 2008 season the housemates no longer nominated, and there was no special nominations show. When nominations resumed in the middle of that season they were shown as part of the Monday evening Daily Show. Where there was special dedicated to the nomination process, this episode presented footage of the housemates as they explain in the Diary Room who they nominate for eviction. In the nomination process itself, housemates each have three points to appoint to two other housemates. Their first nomination appoints two nomination points to a housemate, the second gives another housemate one point. If Big Brother feels a housemate's nomination is not clear and concise, he may decide to give the nominating housemate one nomination point. The three housemates with the highest number of points are revealed to the housemates. In the case of a third place tie, all those tying for third place are eligible for eviction. On these occasions more than three housemates would be up for eviction. An innovation introduced in Big Brother 2005 was the Three Point Twist whereby the winner of Friday Night Live must subtract three nomination points from one of the nominated housemates. If they themselves are included in the original lineup of potential evictees they may opt to subtract the points from themselves. This occurs after the initial nominations have been announced to all housemates, and while housemates may not discuss which housemate they remove points from, where the line-up changes it is often clear which housemate has had their nomination points deducted. The three housemates with the highest number of nomination points after the Three Point Twist will face eviction. Again in the case of a third place tie, more than three housemates may be up for eviction. The Three Point Twist got its name as part of a sponsorship deal with KFC. Big Brother 2007 introduced a new version of the \\"nominations twist\\" where the winner of Friday Night Games must now entirely remove a housemate who is nominated for eviction, and then nominate a new housemate to be up for eviction. For the first five weeks of the Big Brother 2008 season there were no housemate nominations viewers could vote to nominate and the housemates voted to evict. Those housemate eviction votes were delivered on air during the Sunday evening eviction show. Halfway through the season nominations made a return after the eviction process was reverted to the original format in which the housemates nominate and the public may vote to evict. There was no special show for the nominations in the 2008 season, they were screened in an extended (one hour) Daily Show on Monday night. Camilla Halliwell holds the record for the most times nominated for eviction. Halliwell, who finished runner-up in the 2006 season, faced the public vote ten times. Rory Ammon, who appears in the eighth season of the show, faced possible eviction on nine occasions. = Confidential = Big Brother Confidential is a mature late-night show narrated by Mike Goldman that premiered on 22 August 2012 as a companion show of the ninth season of the programme. The series is styled with a series of random vignettes showing housemates getting up to trouble or doing something funny. Mike Goldman narrates each sketch which often begins with an animation making a joke out of what will be shown. Reviews for the programme were negative when compared to previous companion shows that aired during Network Ten's run of the show like Uncut and Adults Only. Initially the series was given an M classification when it premiered in its original Wednesday 10:10pm timeslot but after one week Nine moved it to air on Thursdays at 8pm. This resulted in its classification being changed from M to PG which was the same as the family-friendly 7pm daily shows. The move was seen as a contradiction to what Nine's Director of Programming and Production told Australian website TV Tonight prior to the launch of the show's launch a month prior in regards to adult debate and discussions that \\"wouldn't play out in a PG slot\\". = Showdown = Big Brother Showdown in its original format is a 60-minute Saturday-night take on Friday Night Live hosted by Shelley Craft with commentation from Mike Goldman and 2012 housemate Michael Beveridge. The games occurred in the house each Friday, but aired Saturdays. The original format lasted 3 weeks. In Showdown's new format, Showdown is recorded on Wednesday, and aired as part of the Big Brother daily show on Thursday. The new format was not hosted. = Late Night Feast = Big Brother Late Night Feast is a late-night adult-orientated weekly episode, aired every Tuesday starting from week 4, at 9.30 pm. This show follows along the lines of Ten's long running Uncut show, but with a point of difference not to focus on nudity.

It can also handle triangular meshes and calibrated images. Originally created during a collaboration between Telecom ParisTech and the R&D; division of EDF, the CloudCompare project began in 2003 with the PhD of Daniel Girardeau-Montaut on Change detection on 3D geometric data.D√©tection de changement sur des donn√©es g√©om√©triques tridimensionnelles, D. Girardeau-Montaut, PhD manuscript (french), 2006 - available on Pastel At that time, its main purpose was to quickly detect changes in 3D high density point clouds acquired with laser scanners in industrial facilities (such as power plants) or building sites.Change Detection on Points Cloud Data acquired with a Ground Laser Scanner, D. Girardeau-Montaut, M. Roux, R. Marc & G. Thibault, ISPRS Workshop Laser Scanning 2005, Enschede, the Netherlands, September 12‚Äì14, 2005 Afterwards it evolved towards a more general and advanced 3D data processing software. It is now an independent open source project and a free software. CloudCompare provides a set of basic tools for manually editing and rendering 3D points clouds and triangular meshes. It also offers various advanced processing algorithms, among which methods for performing: * projections (axis-based, cylinder or a cone unrolling, ...) * registration (ICP, ...) * distance computation (cloud-cloud or cloud-mesh the nearest neighbor distance, ...) * statistics computation (spatial Chi-squared test, ...) * segmentation (connected components labeling, front propagation based, ...) * geometric features estimation (density, curvature, roughness, geological plane orientation, ...) CloudCompare can handle unlimited scalar fields per point cloud on which various dedicated algorithms can be applied (smoothing, gradient evaluation, statistics, etc.). A dynamic color rendering system helps the user to visualize per-point scalar fields in an efficient way. Therefore, CloudCompare can also be used to visualize N-D data. The user can interactively segment 3D entities (with a 2D polyline drawn on screen), interactively rotate/translate one or more entities relatively to the others, interactively pick single points or couples of points (to get the corresponding segment length) or triplets of points (to get the corresponding angle and plane normal). The latest version also supports the creation of 2D labels attached to points or rectangular areas annotations. CloudCompare is available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X platforms, for both 32 and 64 bits architectures. It is developed in C++ with Qt.  Input/Output  CloudCompare supports input/output in the following formats: * BIN (CloudCompare own binary format) * ASCII cloud (one point per line \\"X Y Z ...\\") [wizard] * PLY cloud or mesh [wizard] * OBJ mesh(es) * VTK cloud or mesh * STL mesh * E57 (ASTM E2807 standardThe ASTM E57 File Format for 3D Imaging Data Exchange, Daniel Huber, Proceedings of the SPIE Vol. 7864A, Electronics Imaging Science and Technology Conference (IS&T;), 3D Imaging Metrology, January, 2011) clouds & calibrated images * LAS and LAZ clouds * Point Cloud Library PCD files * FBX mesh * SHP files * OFF mesh (Geomview) * PTX cloud (Leica) * FLS/FWS cloud(s) (Faro) * DP cloud(s) (DotProduct) * RDB / RDBX / RDS cloud(s) (Riegl) * PSZ projects (Photoscan) * Various other polyline formats Moreover, thanks to a collaboration with Pr. Irwin Scollar (creator of AirPhoto SE, a program for the geometric rectification of aerial images & orthophotos from multiple images), CloudCompare can also import Snavely's Bundler SfM software output file (.out) to generate orthorectified images (directly as image files or as 2D point clouds) and an approximated DTM (based on Bundler key-points) colored with images data. CloudCompare can also import various other formats: Aveva PDMS '.mac' scripts (supported primitives: cylinder, plane, cone, torus, dish, box, snout and profile extrusion), SOI (from old Mensi Soisic scanners), PN, PV, POV, ICM, etc. Eventually, CloudCompare can also export Maya ASCII files (MA).  Plugins  A plugin mechanism enables further extension of CloudCompare capabilities. Two kinds of plugins are available: * standard plugins for algorithms coming either from the academic world (ShadeVis,ShadeVis an open source tool for computing ambient occlusion HPR,Direct Visibility of Point Sets, Sagi Katz , Ayellet Tal, and Ronen Basri, SIGGRAPH 2007, ACM Transactions on Graphics, Volume 26, Issue 3, August 2007 Poisson reconstruction,Poisson Surface Reconstruction, M.

The site is in the French department of Ard√®che, Rh√¥ne-Alpes. During the Roman Imperial era, Alba was the capital of the Celtic-speaking polity of Helvii, which had territory covering the area of lower Vivarais.  History  civitates of Gaul, according to Caesar A settlement is likely to have existed at the site of Alba before the civitas of the Helvii came under Roman rule, and there are indications of an early oppidum near the Chaul√®ne plateau, northwest of Alba. The excavations west of the site (\\"Saint-Pierre\\") comes with lithic debris from the end of the third millennium. At the site of two \\"domus\\" south-east of the site (\\"home field Delauzun\\"), a habitat La T√®ne III (first century) also was revealed by the discovery of imported ceramics, as well as collars, handles, or lips of wine amphoras, and Italy and Allobrogian currency, issued before the third quarter of the first century. Other oppida are known in the territory of Helvii, such as at Jastres North. Their neighbors to the north were the Segusiavi, to the west the Vellavi and Gabali, and to the south the Volcae Arecomici. In 121 BC, the Arverni, a Celtic people from the Auvergne, were defeated by the Roman consul Fabius Maximus. Their king, Bituitos, was taken to Rome and paraded in a Roman triumph. Fabius Maximus managed to dissociate the Helvii and Allobroges from the Arverni, and drew them instead into an alliance with Rome. In 83 BC, the leader of the Helvii was granted Roman citizenship by the proconsul Gaius Valerius Flaccus, and incorporated his patron's name into his own, becoming Gaius Valerius Caburus. One of his two sons, Gaius Valerius Troucillus, was highly regarded by Caesar, and employed by him as an interpreter and diplomatic liaison during the Gallic Wars. In 52 BC, the Helvii held the border of the Roman province against an invasion of forces sent by Vercingetorix. Subsequently, Alba adopted privilege of Roman law. Attached first to the Gaul aquitaine at Strabo, the site was integrated into the Narbonnaise. \\"The starting point of Roman roads to Valencia, Lyon and Vienna by the bank of the Rhone, on the other hand to Bourg-Saint-And√©ol and Narbonne, finally to Gergovie ‚Äì excluding roads; center an agricultural region and especially viticulture centre of regional trade, Gaul, and even imperial (...), Alba is from the first century a major city\\", says Marcel Le Glay. Christianity came to the region at the end of the first century, though the time the first episcopal see of the region was established is uncertain. After its decline and abandonment, probably at the end of the third century, the city was abandoned in the middle of the fourth century in favor of Viviers. Against the wall of the Jewish cemetery in the northern district of Bonn, Germany is a relief of the gravestone of the first known inhabitants of Bonn. The tombstone inscription, translated from Latin, means: The ancient city, not counting its enclosure, spans thirty hectares and was bounded by the necropolis of Saint-Martin (first to second century AD) to the southeast and Saint-Pierre (second to fourth centuries AD) to the west. Its perimeter is estimated at four kilometres. No reliable estimation of the city's population is available.  Archeology  = North ward = The area that is now called Bagnols contains the first traces of settlement on the plain of Alba. The ancient city is part of the area and then spread to the place called the Palace of around monumental center. North of the ancient city, as the city grows, is Gallo-Roman popular housing and a commercial property. From the first century AD, allegiance Helviens to the Emperor and complete integration into the Roman Empire is evidenced in the site. In 1992, a statue of a deified emperor was found. The site of the statue is connected to the center of the city by a monumental processional route. However, traces of abandonment and reuse of stones of the sanctuary are in evidence from the third century, an early sign of the abandonment of Roman ideals and living. = Monumental forum = District Palace On a forum dated to the second century, located at the top of the monumental center of the city, there was discovered a sarcophagus. On it are enumerated four drapers (centonarii), construction workers ( manufacturer ), Utricularia (utriclarii ) and suppliers of wooden constructions (dendrophori) all of which seem related to the wine trade. The forum rests today in the vineyard, and has been identified through surveys during excavations. In the north, a building serving the public consisting of four wings is built around a garden with two ponds. Its function is unclear. In the south, the sacred space consists of two buildings built gantry in a row. The south portico, which contained neat decor (marble veneers, soft limestone columns, floor mosaic with geometric decoration), is a covered porch that opens onto a courtyard. A temple with vestibule ( pronaos) and a large room ( cella) is at the center of the court. South of the temple is a court and place of trade. =Hydraulic structures underground = Paved Way A complex network of pipes was discovered in 1966, forty metres south of the paved road. The main pipe from the creek bed runs first south and then turns at a right angle to the west. The construction is of marked quality. Small holes were drilled in the left wall of buildings in the city that allowed for water infiltration. On the right walls were arranged small secondary channels, ensuring water evacuation. On one pipe, there is an inscription dedicating the water supply to the individual responsible for its construction. = The theater = The theater Southeast, a theater is crossed by the stream. Excavations have revealed that the development of the theatre was done in three stages. The oldest theater‚Äîmade of bleachers, earth, and wooden boards‚Äîonly occupies the right bank of the creek that found later channeled. It dates from the end of the first century. The first reconstruction was effected in 30-45 AD, and a second at the beginning of the second century. On the right bank of the creek, four walls and semi-circular concentric bore the steps of the cavea seats reserved for spectators, only one remains. Could be accessed from the outside by vaulted passages (vomitoria). The orchestra which took place on seats of honor three rows of privileged spectators remain several large slabs semicircle. A long oblique wall, south of the theater, must have belonged to an important building. The scene was laid in the passage of the stream. On its left bank stood the stage wall and rear, an enclosed courtyard. = The private baths = South-west of the ancient city and the modern village entrance are spa, set infive rooms aligned from north to south. On the first level was a cloakroom (apodyterium), a basin with coated marble slabs, and a cold room (frigidarium). On the second level were three rooms (caldarium and tepidarium) between which the hot air circulated. Due to the size of the rooms, these spa have been suggested to be public baths. Coins were found in the peripheral rooms. = Basalts = The site and its sanctuary are less than a hundred meters north of the baths. It seems to be composed of buildings for agricultural or crafts and more modest dwellings. = Villas = Luxurious dwellings were discovered accidentally in 1967 in the south-east of the city, near to the river Escoutay, in a field. It is on this site that various objects (lamp oil, coins, and animal bones) were found. These remain the oldest fragments of amphorae and ceramics imported from Italy at the time the site was active. In the first house, there is a garden, dining room (triclinium), and a small room still partially provided with its hypocaust heating device. The second house does not comply with the alignment of the street. It has yielded mosaics dated later than those of the first house, from the end of the second or early third century.

Pafman, defensor de Logro√±o City With the creation in 1986 of Ediciones B, that inherited the rights of Bruguera publications, Cera went on the payroll, beginning the most prolific period of his career as a cartoonist. Sometimes alone, with characters like Pafman (created in 1987, about a bumbling superhero with an anthropomorphous cat siderick) or Dr. Pacostein (created in 1991 about the misadventures of a mad scientist in love with a nurse of his job), sometimes making tandem with Juan Carlos Ramis with characters such as Los Xunguis (a group of thug extraterrestrials) or some pages featuring the characters of Escobar Zipi y Zape, Cera was one of the authors with more collaborations in the Ediciones B magazines of the 1990s, with strips in the magazines TBO, S√∫per Mortadelo and S√∫per Zipi y Zape. In fact, the Ramis-Cera duet aptly complemented works of distinguished authors such as Ib√°√±ez, Escobar (Cera helped him with the ink in his last pages), Jan or Raf. In 1996, the publisher of Ediciones B decided to close all comic magazines and the authors, except for Ib√°nez and Jan, were dispatched. Cera then started to work as a screenwriter for child television programs such as Con mucha marcha and cartoon series of Neptuno Films such as La vaca Connie o Bandolero.

Their approximate chemical composition is Ni2.5B, and they are often incorrectly denoted \\"'\\" in organic chemistry publications. Nickel boride catalysts are typically prepared by reacting a salt of nickel with sodium borohydride. The composition and properties vary depending on the specific preparation method. The two most common forms, described and evaluated in detail by Herbert C. Brown and Charles Allan Brown in 1963, are known as P‚àí1 nickel and P‚àí2 nickel. These catalysts are usually obtained as black granules (P‚àí1) or colloidal suspensions (P‚àí2). They are air-stable, non-magnetic and non-pyrophoric, but slowly react with water to form nickel hydroxide . They are insoluble in all solvents, but react with concentrated mineral acids. They are claimed to be more effective hydrogenation catalysts than Raney nickel. History These catalysts originate during World War II with the work of a research group led by Hermann I. Schlesinger, discoverer of borohydrides. They noted that reaction of with salts of certain transition metals yielded black precipitates, and that the cobalt product catalyzed the decomposition of borohydride. However, their research was focused on war-related applications, and the black precipitate was not investigated further. In 1951, Raymond Paul and others investigated the reaction of with nickel chloride, sulfate, and acetate in various solvents and measured their performance as hydrogenation catalysts. In 1963, H. C. Brown and Charles A. Brown reported the synthesis and performance of two similar catalysts, which they denoted by \\"P-1\\" (the same as Paul's) and \\"P-2\\", obtained by reacting sodium borohydride with nickel acetate in water and ethanol, respectively. Preparation In contrast with other borides, which require high temperatures, preparation of these nickel boride catalysts can be carried out at ambient temperature, without special equipment. Ineded, they are usually generated in situ. The P‚àí1 catalyst can be generated by reacting a nickel(II) salt, such as sulfate, chloride, nitrate, or acetate, and sodium borohydride in alkaline aqueous solutions. The product precipitates as a fine, black granular powder. The chemistry is very similar to that of electroless nickel-boron plating, and yields hydrogen gas and the corresponding sodium salt as byproducts. The borohydride must be added gradually to the nickel salt solution, not the other way around, because the product catalyzes the hydrolysis of borohydride to hydrogen and hypoborate . The catalytic activity of P-1 is enhanced by adding small amount of salts of other metals (but not cobalt) to the nickel salt during preparation. Benzene however reduces its activity somewhat. The P‚àí2 form is prepared similarly from nickel(II) acetate and sodium borohydride in ethanol. An inert atmosphere was found necessary for maximum catalytic activity. The result was an almost colloidal suspension of the black catalyst.Another method uses nickel chloride NiCl2 instead of acetate. Structure and composition The P-1 and P-2 \\"nickel boride\\" catalyst have been suggested to be amorphous compounds, composed of nickel bonded to individual boron centres. However that structure was later found to be incorrect. An X-ray diffraction analysis of P-1 by L. Hofer and others in 1964 indicated that the nickel and boron contents were in 2.5:1 ratio, but the solid contained 11% of strongly bound water and other compounds. was amorphous when freshly prepared (with crystalline nanoparticles about 1.5 nm across), but even heating at 90 ¬∞C caused the formation of some crystalline nickel. Heating at 250 ¬∞C caused it to separate into two phases: metallic nickel, and crystalline trinickel boride with the cementite structure, stable at least up to 750 C. No trace of the true dinickel boride was seen. The authors concluded that P-1 was an intimate mixture of metallic nickel and some amorphous boron-containing compound. The true structure of these \\"nickel borides\\" was elucidated only in 2007. They consist of small grains of crystalline nickel boride embedded in an amorphous nickel matrix. The two forms P‚àí1 and P‚àí2 differ in terms of amount of their contamination by NaBO2 adsorbed on the surface. P‚àí1 Ni2B has an oxide to boride ratio of 1:4, whereas that of P‚àí2 Ni2B is 10:1. Their properties differ in terms of catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity. Applications Ni2B is an efficient catalyst and reducing agent. It is used as a heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst. =Catalytic hydrogenation= The catalytic activity of P‚àí1 is insensitive to steric hindrance of side chains on the substrate and thus more active, and seldom affects protecting groups. In contrast, P‚àí2 is very sensitive to steric factors. For these reasons, P‚àí1 is usually used for the complete reduction of unsaturated hydrocarbons under mild conditions, while P‚àí2 is useful in partial reductions such as converting alkynes to alkenes in high yields: 550px The H2/Ni2B system will not hydrogenolyse ethers, alcohols, aldehydes, amines and amides as it reduces alkenes in preference, even under forcing conditions. It leaves epoxides unaffected, but affects cyclopropanes occasionally. Most esters are stable to Ni2B, except for benzylic, allylic and propargylic esters which are cleaved by hydrogenolysis: 550px =Desulfurization= The NiCl2/NaBH4 system desulfurizes thioamides, thioethers, thioesters, thiols and sulfides. Organic sulfides, disulfides, thiols, and sulfoxides are reduced by NiCl2/NaBH4 to hydrocarbons. Illustrated is the reduction of phenothiazine to diphenylamine: 550px Ni2B can also be used to cleave thioacetals. Since Ni2B is non-pyrophoric, stable in air, and give high yields in many cases, it is proposed as a safer alternative to Raney Nickel for removal of cyclic thioacetals.Desulfurization catalyzed by Ni2B proved to occur with retention of configuration by isotopic labeling. =Reduction of nitrogenous groups= The NiCl2/NaBH4 system reduces aliphatic nitro groups, nitriles and oximes completely to amines. For aryl amines, nitrobenzenes are converted to anilines, and azoxybenzenes to azobenzenes. Azides are cleanly reduced to amines in preference to sterically hindered aliphatic nitro groups: 500px =Dehalogenation= Most organic fluorides and chlorides are unaffected by Ni2B, bromides show variable reactivity, and iodides are often completely reduced to hydrocarbons. With Ni2B in DMF, Œ±-bromoketones are reduced to the parent ketones. Vicinal bromides are dehalogenated to alkenes: 550px For aryl bromides, the modified system Ni(PPh3)3Cl2/NaBH4 in DMF is used for clean debromination. Reductive cleavage of iodides occurs with retention of configuration. Safety Nickel compounds are possible carcinogens and contact with skin should be avoided. Particular care should be taken whenever NiCl2/NaBH4 is used in DMF as sodium borohydride may spontaneously ignite in DMF.

Over a 43 year career that spanned oceans and seas the world over she had 10 owners, eight names and a succession of different managers. She is best known today as the Flying Lark, given to her by her final owners in 1957. That is the name she bore in the Moluccas in eastern Indonesia in April 1958 when a CIA aircraft involved in a covert mission against the Sukarno government attacked and sank her, killing at least nine of her crew. Construction Fredrikstad Mekaniske Verksted of Fredrikstad, Norway built the ship as the banana boat SS Honduras. She had two fire tube boilers with a combined heating surface of that supplied steam at 180 lbf/in2 to a three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engine. There is some discrepancy over her nominal horsepower: a Norwegian source claims that her engine produced 258 NHP but Lloyd's Register records it as 188 NHP. Service history Honduras was built for Peder Johannesen's Dampskibsselskab Globe (\\"Globe Steamship Co\\") of T√∏nsberg, which registered her in Kristiania, Norway. In 1918 P. Johannesen sold Honduras to C.H.F. Jensen, and in 1920 her management was transferred to S. Dreyer. Both Jensen and Dreyer were based in Kristiania, which from 1925 was renamed Oslo. In 1934 Honduras was sold to Weinberger Banana Co, who renamed her Tuxpam and registered her in Bluefields, Nicaragua. In 1938 she was transferred to Weinberger Steam Ship Co, and in 1939 she was renamed Denny. In the same year she was sold to Akc. Bve. Leituvos Baltijos Lloydas (\\"Lithuanian Baltic Lloyd\\") of ≈†ventoji, Lithuania, who renamed her Trakai. In June 1942 the United States Maritime Commission took her over, registered her in Panama City, and placed her in the management of Agwilines Inc. of Panama. Management was transferred to the United Fruit Company in September 1943, then to Lykes Brothers Steamship Company in October 1944, and back to United Fruit Co in July 1945. In October 1945 Trakai was laid up. In 1946 Trakai was sold to Hadjilias Interests' Compa√±√≠a de Navegaci√≥n Insular S.A. of Panama, who registered her in Greece and renamed her Phoenix. In 1948 she was sold to Soci√©t√© Maritime Auxiliare de Transports of Basle, Switzerland, who renamed her Ville de Gen√®ve and registered her in Rouen, France. In 1955 she was sold to D.S. Zabasas and others of Beirut, Lebanon, who registered her in Greece and renamed her Ionion. By the late 1950s the vessel was trading as a general cargo ship rather than a banana boat. In 1957 she was sold to Chiap Huah Shipping Co of Panama (the shipping subsidiary of Chiap Huah Manufactory of Hong Kong), who renamed her Flying Lark and registered her in Panama. Sinking At the end of April 1958 Flying Lark was in Amboina Harbour in Indonesia loading a cargo of copra. On 28 April a Douglas B-26 Invader bomber aircraft, operated by the CIA and painted black and with no markings, bombed and damaged her. The attack killed nine of the crew and another six were reported missing. The damaged Flying Lark stayed afloat for at least two days, but sank on or after 30 April. In the same attack, the same aircraft hit and sank the merchant ships and . One source asserts that all three ships were off the port of Donggala near Palu in Central Sulawesi (at least west of Ambon) when they were hit. This now appears doubtful, as Aquilas wreck seems to have been identified in Ambon Bay. Another source states that Flying Lark was attacked on 1 or 2 May. This may result partly from confusion between the date she was bombed and the date she sank. The attack was part of a CIA covert operation to support right-wing Permesta rebels in North Sulawesi to destabilise President Sukarno's government of Indonesia. The CIA pilots had orders to target foreign merchant ships to drive foreign trade away from Indonesian waters, thereby weakening the Indonesian economy in the belief that this would undermine Sukarno. The pilot was the CIA and former USAF pilot Allen Pope. On 18 May the Indonesian Navy and Air Force shot down Pope's aircraft and captured him, after which the USA rapidly aborted the CIA mission and reversed its policy towards Indonesia.

The original specimen was collected in 1912 near Yarrowitch. This plant is a sub-species of the Tantoon of the Myrtle family. It resembles other plants commonly referred to as \\"tea trees\\" or \\"paperbarks\\". The sub-species term montanum refers to its habitat of high altitudes. Polygalifolium is derived from Latin, referring to the resemblance of the leaves to certain members of the Polygala.  Habitat  It grows at the heads of mountain streams, or in rocky areas within crevices with shallow soils, often derived from granite or basalt. Usually seen in relatively fire free areas at high altitude in rainforests or rainforest margins north of the Barrington Tops region. The most northerly recording is at Mount Cordeaux.  Description  Usually seen as a shrub, one to seven metres tall. Though at Mount Hyland Nature Reserve it grows to 25 metres tall and a stem diameter of 56 cm. The trunk is not regular, with vertical flutings, particularly near the base. Bark is papery on older trees, greyish or pale brown. New branchlets are thin with soft silky hairs. Leaves are alternate on the stem, 10 to 15 mm long, 3 to 5 mm wide, usually with a blunt point. Leaf margins curl over, dark green above, paler below the leaf. Silky hairs appear on the young leaves. Leaves are reverse lanceolate to elliptic in shape. Leaf stems short or indistinct. Oil dots easily noticed under a lens. Only the midrib is visible on the bottom surface of the leaf. Single white flowers form from October to January, 12 mm in diameter. The hypanthium is around 3.5 mm long, the sepals around 2 mm long. The fruit is a grey hemispherical capsule with a flat base, 6 to 9 mm in diameter. The capsule stalk is 2 to 3 mm long. When opening, the capsule reveals five widely spreading valves. Fruit matures from October to April.

It contains 81 leaves of dimensions 32 cm x 21,5 cm. It is kept in Cetinje monastery. There are other versions of this collection (in Odessa, St Petersburg, &c.;) which are not identical to the original because the original texts were transcribed by different people at different times. The first scholar who used this chronicle as source for his works was Vasilije Petroviƒá who used it for his work on history of Montenegro, published in Moscow in 1754. ¬¥There are several preserved transcriptions of this manuscript collection. The original is kept in Cetinje monastery. One version was given in 1830 by Njego≈° to Polish collector Kucharski. After Kucharski's death it was purchased by Odessa University.  Name  The name of the book which is written on its covers is –ö—Ä—É—Å–æ–≤–æ–ª—å. Until the end of the 19th century it was referred to as the \\"Montenegrin Chronicle\\" (Crnogorski ljetopis) or \\"Crnojeviƒá's Chrysobull\\" (Krusovolj Crnojeviƒáa). Because it is kept in the Cetinje monastery, built by Ivan Crnojeviƒá in 1484, it is referred to as the \\"Cetinje chronicle\\".  Background  After Ottoman Empire captured Skadar in 1479 Ivan Crnojeviƒá moved his court from easily accessible Zeta Plain to the mountains where he built his court (1482) and Cetinje monastery (1484). Remarkable collection of manuscripts was taken to the new court and monastery during the exodus from the churches in the plain. At the end of 15th century Cetinje monastery became an important center for collecting and transcription of old charters and other books. The Cetinje chronicle is a longer and supplemented version of the Studenica Chronicle (Studeniƒçki letopis), written in 2nd quarter of the 15th century.  Content  =Ode to Nemanja= = Biography of Skanderbeg= The first manuscript in the chronicle is the biography of Skanderbeg, which is the major part of the chronicle. It is translation of Barleti's work on Skanderbeg which is shortened either during translation or during transcription performed by Vasilije.

Cetinje Chronicle also contains the charter of Ivan Crnojeviƒá of 1485 in which he recorded his donation of land and property to the Cetinje Monastery. A transcript of 1485 Golden bull of Ivan Crnojeviƒá by which he established the Cetinje Monastery is part of the Cetinje chronicle.

There are at least 25 species of lichen on the common, and the presence of several species of Cladonia indicates the high quality of this ancient heathland. In a few poorly-drained hollows, wet heath has developed with cross-leaved heath and purple moor- grass, heath rush and the sundews, round-leaved sundew and oblong-leaved sundew. Sphagnum compactum grows here, as does the nationally rare moss Hypnum imponens. Yately Common, and Kingsley Common include several priority bird species such as European nightjar, Dartford warbler, woodlark and song thrush. Chilbolton Common supports important numbers of breeding common redshank, northern lapwings, common snipe and warblers. The nationally rare sand lizard occurs here, and there is a wide range of invertebrates associated with the warm sandy habitat, including the parasitic ant Sifolinia karavajeva, and the grayling and the silver-studded blue butterflies.

Fuad's style of music incorporates fusion, folk, rock, pop and electronic dance music. He has been one of the pioneering musicians to introduce a new style of music merging Eastern Sounds with Western beats and remixing. His music is a stylistic melting pot much like the culture of NYC, where he grew up. Early life Born in Chittagong (Silhety) , Fuad's parents moved the entire family to the United States of America in 1988 when Fuad was only eight years old. Growing up abroad, parents typically go the extra mile to ingrain cultural values and a sense of heritage in non- resident Bangladeshi children and Fuad's parents were no different. His childhood was full of participation in Bangladeshi cultural events in New York City. Fuad's parents always discouraged speaking English at home, which strengthened his skills for the language and gave him a strong point of connection with the Bangladeshi music listeners. As a teenager, like any other NRB kids, Fuad led a dual life. He participated in the high school band and was part of a heavy metal band with peers called \\"Disillusion\\" with front man Andrew Janda, who also grew up to have a successful music career and is a part of a popular heavy metal band called \\"Metalfire\\". After school he would bond and jam with his Bangladeshi friends, Richard, Himel, Nayeem and Suman and joined a Bangladeshi cover band called \\"Zefyr\\" (1993). They recorded several tracks and before disbanding in 1999, they featured in fuad's first compilation albums called \\"Maya\\" and \\"Maya II\\" among the NRB community in New York. Last of three brothers, Almuqtadir moved back to Bangladesh in 2006 to pursue his passion for Bangla music and became a big name even before he reached Dhaka and eventually signed many record deals and collaborated with many like minded musicians in Bangladesh. Fuad is known for launching many new pop artists. Career His First 2 albums Maya and Maya II were distributed by a label fuad started with his friends Bushra Ahmed and Saiful Khandker. Without any knowledge about the industry they just made these albums and hand delivered them to music stores in Jackson Heights, NY. The music instantly became a big hit among young listeners and started to put Fuad in the limelight. After Maya and Maya 2, Fuad created a band with Richard, Shihab, Upol and Anila called Kranti. Kranti was an alternative rock album with a lot of emphasis placed on lyrics unlike Fuad's previous pop productions. Then came the game changer album called Re/Evolution. Almuqtadir shot to fame in the year 2005 with the release of this album which hit the music industry in Bangladesh, showcasing beats, melodies and mixes unique to the Bangladeshi contemporary music scene. This album also featured a lot of Fuad's Jamaican and west Indian friends. With the help of Sohel Aziz, a notable keyboardist from the band Obscure, the album came out in collaboration with both mainstream and underground musicians featuring 14 tracks which included original songs and remixes. Some of the notable songs in the album were \\"Sylhoti\\", Anila Chowdhury‚Äôs \\"Jhilmil\\", Armeen Musa's \\"Bhromor Koiyo\\" and the remixed track \\"Mon Chaile Mon\\". Not only did bands and solo artists crowd Fuad's studio for a production contract, several corporates and brands also signed up with Almuqtadir for jingles, theme songs and brand ambassadorship. Fuad's Variation No. 25 was produced in 2006 and later two additional songs were added and the album was re-released as Variation No. 25.2 jointly by G-Series and Aarshee. Some tracks from the album were \\"Nobina\\" by Poonam (Nahar), \\"Nitol Paye\\" by Rajib Rahman/Fuad and Bappa Mazumder‚Äôs \\"Kono Asroy\\". Variation 25 was packaged in a campaign for NESCAFE. NESCAFE had already distributed close to a hundred thousand albums before the first album hit the stores for sale. in 2005 If you purchased Nescafe's coffee, chances are you got a free Fuad album. Fuad's album Bonno was released in 2007 by G-Series. Some of the tracks from the album were \\"Tor Jonno Ami Bonno\\" by Upol Islam, \\"Bonno Rap\\" by Fuad/Bishop, \\"Junglee\\", \\"Da Dushto Number\\" and \\"Nitol Paye (Live)\\". Fuad also worked on albums of Sumon & Anila titled \\"Ekhon Ami\\", Topu's \\"Bondhu Bhabo Ki?\\", Fuad ft. Kona, Fuad Ft. Mila and Fuad ft Shireen, Fuad ft. various artists \\"Kromannoy\\" which released in 2008. Fuad featured a number of famous singers and musicians in Bangladesh like Bassbaba Sumon, Mila, Topu, Shunno, Imran, Subho, Elita, and many more. Almuqtadir also lent his signature tunes to various products, brands and telcos such as 7Up, Coca- Cola, Nokia, Grameenphone, Airtel, and Robi just to name a few. In 2012, Fuad toured Bangladesh, in association with Robi Telcom, to look for unique voices amongst the youth. The selected were then featured in a talent show on Maasranga TV in Bangladesh. Fuad was the judge and later produced an album with the winning artists. In 2014, Fuad Almuqtadir had the opportunity to produce the theme song for the 2014 ICC T20 World Cup \\"Char Chokka Hoi Hoi\\"which was released in 20 February 2014 and was sung by an ensamble of vocalists, namely Dilshad Nahar Kona, Elita Karim, Pantha Kanai, Johan Alamgir, Sanvir Huda, Badhon Sarkar Puja and Kaushik Hossain Taposh. The song received mixed reaction and was widely criticized on the grounds that the lyrics and the subsequent music video did not adequately capture the essence of Bangladeshi culture. Despite this, the song became hugely popular in a short duration of time due to its catchy tune and energetic beat. A competition was held by ICC which invited students from the three host cities, Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet to create and submit their own dance videos helped popularize the song. The competition gave rise to flashmobs and performances in a number of major cities in Bangladesh and eventually the trend continued all over the world to New York, London, China and Russia well after the deadline for the competition. Due to its now-global appeal and signature dance moves, Char Chokka Hoi Hoi has been compared to other dance trends such as ‚ÄòGangnam Style‚Äô and ‚ÄòHarlem Shake‚Äô. In 2015, Fuad was one of the three judges of Fanta Band, a teen talent hunt show which took place in Bangladesh along with singers Jon Kabir and Elita Karim. Fuad judged teen singers who arrived from all over the country to participate in the competition and also co-wrote the final songs..... with Shakib Chowdhury.

The video was uploaded on his official Facebook and said to have been in good fun but the video went viral shortly after and was followed by another video by Shafin Ahmed, voicing his anger.

Screenwriter, Des Garbes Severino assigned as the headwriter of the series. While there are many similarities to the original series, some changes were made by adding more interesting twists and turns, new characters and Pinoy flavour to it. \\"When we adapt, we get the main story or the main premise. Most of the major plotlines are intact. We adapt it to our local setting. For instance, in the original version, Andy is a delivery girl. But we're not familiar with that, although we do have delivery boys. So we've made her a tricycle driver. If you notice, the Korean version, though a romance-comedy, is more on light romance. This time around, we explore the concept of romantic comedy. There will be funny scenes along with heartwarming moments,\\" Severino shares. She also admits that doing an adaptation is quite challenging. The creative people behind Coffee Prince are also faced with the task to make the story, given the character arcs, more interesting and better than the original. \\"Die-hard fans, who know every twist and turn of the story, won‚Äôt get disappointed because the iconic scenes such as Arthur carrying Andy on his back and he running after her from condo to restaurant asking for apology will be there,\\"she added.

Such operators arose naturally in the work on integral operators of Hilbert, Korn, Lichtenstein and Marty required to solve elliptic boundary value problems on bounded domains in Euclidean space. Between the late 1940s and early 1960s the techniques, previously developed as part of classical potential theory, were abstracted within operator theory by various mathematicians, including M. G. Krein, William T. Reid, Peter Lax and Jean Dieudonn√©. Fredholm theory already implies that any element of the spectrum is an eigenvalue. The main results assert that the spectral theory of these operators is similar to that of compact self-adjoint operators: any spectral value is real; they form a sequence tending to zero; any generalized eigenvector is an eigenvector; and the eigenvectors span a dense subspace of the Hilbert space. Discussion Let H be a Hilbert space. A compact operator K on H is symmetrizable if there is a bounded self-adjoint operator S on H such that S is positive with trivial kernel, i.e. (Sx,x) > 0 for all non-zero x, and SK is self-adjoint: : \\\\displaystyle{SK=K^*S.} In many applications S is also compact. The operator S defines a new inner product on H :\\\\displaystyle{(x,y)_S= (Sx,y)}. Let HS be the Hilbert space completion of H with respect to this inner product. The operator K defines a formally self-adjoint operator on the dense subspace H of HS. As Krein (1947) and noted, the operator has the same operator norm as K. In fact the self-adjointness condition implies :\\\\displaystyle{SK^n = (K^*)^nS.} It follows by induction that, if (x,x)S = 1, then :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Kx\\\\_S^{2^n}\\\\le \\\\K^{2^{n}}x\\\\_S.} Hence :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Kx\\\\_S\\\\le \\\\limsup_{n\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\K\\\\ (\\\\S\\\\\\\\x\\\\^2)^{1/2^n} =\\\\K\\\\} If K is only compact, Krein gave an argument, invoking Fredholm theory, to show that K defines a compact operator on HS. A shorter argument is available if K belongs to a Schatten class. When K is a Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operator, the argument proceeds as follows. Let R be the unique positive square root of S and for Œµ > 0 define :\\\\displaystyle{A_\\\\varepsilon = (R+\\\\varepsilon I)^{-1}SK(R+\\\\varepsilon I)^{-1}.} These are self-adjoint Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operator on H which are uniformly bounded in the Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt norm: :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\A_\\\\varepsilon\\\\_2^2=(R^2(R+\\\\varepsilon I)^{-2}K, KR^2(R+\\\\varepsilon I)^{-2})_2\\\\le \\\\K\\\\_2^2,} Since the Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operators form a Hilbert space, there is a subsequence converging weakly to s self-adjoint Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operator A. Since AŒµ R tends to RK in Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt norm, it follows that :\\\\displaystyle{RK=AR.} Thus if U is the unitary induced by R between HS and H, then the operator KS induced by the restriction of K corresponds to A on H: :\\\\displaystyle{UK_SU^*=A.} The operators K ‚àí ŒªI and K* ‚àí ŒªI are Fredholm operators of index 0 for Œª ‚â† 0, so any spectral value of K or K* is an eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenspaces are finite-dimensional. On the other hand, by the special theorem for compact operators, H is the orthogonal direct sum of the eigenspaces of A, all finite-dimensional except possibly for the 0 eigenspace. Since RA = K* R, the image under R of the Œª eigenspace of A lies in the Œª eigenspace of K*. Similarly R carries the Œª eigenspace of K into the Œª eigenspace of A. It follows that the eigenvalues of K and K* are all real. Since R is injective and has dense range it induces isomorphisms between the Œª eigenspaces of A, K and K*. The same is true for generalized eigenvalues since powers of K ‚àí ŒªI and K* ‚àí ŒªI are also Fredholm of index 0. Since any generalized Œª eigenvector of A is already an eigenvector, the same is true for K and K*. For Œª = 0, this argument shows that Kmx = 0 implies Kx = 0. Finally the eigenspaces of K* span a dense subspace of H, since it contains the image under R of the corresponding space for A. The above arguments also imply that the eigenvectors for non-zero eigenvalues of KS in HS all lie in the subspace H. Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operators K with non-zero real eigenvalues Œªn satisfy the following identities proved by : :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathrm{tr}\\\\, K^2 = \\\\sum \\\\lambda_n^2,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\det (I-zK^2) =\\\\prod_{n=1}^\\\\infty (1-z\\\\lambda_n^2).} Here tr is the trace on trace-class operators and det is the Fredholm determinant. For symmetrizable Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt operators the result states that the trace or determinant for K or K* is equal to the trace or determinant for A. For symmetrizable operators, the identities for K* can be proved by taking H0 to be the kernel of K* and Hm the finite dimensional eigenspaces for the non-zero eigenvalues Œªm. Let PN be the orthogonal projection onto the direct sum of Hm with 0 ‚â§ m ‚â§ N. This subspace is left invariant by K*. Although the sum is not orthogonal the restriction PNK*PN of K* is similar by a bounded operator with bounded inverse to the diagonal operator on the orthogonal direct sum with the same eigenvalues. Thus :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathrm{tr}\\\\,(P_NK^*P_N)^2 =\\\\sum_{m=1}^N \\\\lambda_m^2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{dim}\\\\, H_m,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathrm{det}\\\\, [P_N - z(P_NK^*P_N)^2] = \\\\prod_{m=1}^N (1-z\\\\lambda_m^2)^{\\\\mathrm{dim}\\\\, H_m}.} Since PNK*PN tends to K* in Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt norm, the identities for K* follow by passing to the limit as N tends to infinity.

All the data in the knowledge resource is open access to allow scientists both in academia and industry to freely access the data for exploration of the human proteome. In September 2019, the version 19 was launched introducing three new sub-atlases in addition to the existing; the Tissue Atlas showing the distribution of the proteins across all major tissues and organs in the human body, the Cell Atlas showing the subcellular localization of proteins in single cells, and the Pathology Atlas showing the impact of protein levels for survival of patients with cancer. The three new sub-atlases being; the Brain Atlas, the Blood Atlas and the Metabolic Atlas. The Human Protein Atlas program has already contributed to several thousands of publications in the field of human biology and disease and was selected by the organization ELIXIR as a European core resource due to its fundamental importance for a wider life science community. The HPA consortium is funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. Six projects The Human Protein Atlas consists of six sub-atlases: The Tissue Atlas: contains information regarding the expression profiles of human genes both on the mRNA and protein level. The protein expression data is derived from antibody-based protein profiling using immunohistochemistry. Altogether 76 different cell types, corresponding to 44 normal human tissue types, have been analyzed and the data is presented as pathology-based annotation of protein expression levels. All underlying images of immunohistochemistry stained normal tissues are available as high- resolution images in the normal tissue atlas. The Cell Atlas provides high- resolution insights into the spatial distribution of proteins within cells. The protein expression data is derived from antibody-based profiling using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. A panel of 64 cell lines, selected to represent various cell populations in different organs of the human body, forms the basis of the Cell Atlas. In this cell line panel the mRNA expression of all human genes have been characterized using deep RNA-sequencing. The subcellular distribution of proteins is investigated in a subset of the cell lines, and classified into 32 different organelles and fine cellular structures. The Pathology Atlas is based on the analysis of 17 main cancer types using data from 8,000 patients. In addition, a new concept for showing patient survival data is introduced, called Interactive Survival Scatter plots, and the atlas includes more than 400,000 such plots. A national supercomputer center was used to analyze more than 2.5 petabytes of underlying publicly available data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to generate more than 900,000 survival plots describing the consequence of RNA and protein levels on clinical survival. The Pathology Atlas also contains 5 million pathology-based images generated by the Human Protein Atlas consortium. The Brain Atlas explores the protein expression in the mammalian brain by visualization and integration of data from three mammalian species (human, pig and mouse). Transcriptomics data combined with affinity-based protein in situ localization down to single cell detail is here available in a brain-centric sub atlas of the Human Protein Atlas. The data focuses on human genes and one- to-one orthologues in pig and mouse. Each gene is provided with a summary page, showing available expression data (mRNA) for summarized regions of the brain as well as protein location for selected targets. High resolution staining images as well as expression data for the individual sub regions are all available for exploring the brain, the most complex organ. The Blood Atlas contains single cell type information on genome-wide RNA expression profiles of human protein-coding genes covering various B- and T-cells, monocytes, granulocytes and dendritic cells. The single cell transcriptomics analysis covers 18 cell types isolated with cell sorting followed by RNA-seq analysis. In addition, an analysis of the ‚Äúhuman secretome‚Äù is presented including annotation of the genes predicted to be actively secreted to human blood, as well as the annotation of proteins predicted to be secreted to other parts of the human body, such as the gastric tract and local compartments. An analysis of the proteins detected in human blood is also presented with an estimation of the respective protein concentrations determined either with mass spectrometry-based proteomics or antibody-based immune assays. The Metabolic Atlas portion of the Tissue Atlas enables exploration of protein function and tissue-specific gene expression in the context of the human metabolic network. For proteins involved in metabolism, a metabolic summary is provided that describes the metabolic subsystems/pathways, cellular compartments, and number of reactions associated with the protein. Over 120 manually curated metabolic pathway maps facilitate the visualization of each protein's participation in different metabolic processes. Each pathway map is accompanied by a heatmap detailing the mRNA levels across 37 different tissue types for all proteins involved in the metabolic pathway. History The Human Protein Atlas program was started in 2003 and funded by the non-profit organization Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW). The main site of the project is the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), School of Engineering Sciences in Chemistry, Biotechnology and Health (Stockholm, Sweden). Professor Mathias Uhl√©n is the director of the program. The research underpinning the start of the exploration of the whole human proteome in the Human Protein Atlas program was carried out in the late 1990s and early 2000s. A pilot study employing an affinity proteomics strategy using affinity-purified antibodies raised against recombinant human protein fragments was carried out for a chromosome-wide protein profiling of chromosome 21. Other projects were also carried out to establish processes for parallel and automated affinity purification of mono- specific antibodies and their validation. Research Antibodies and antigens, produced in the Human Protein Atlas workflow, are used in research projects to study potential biomarkers in various diseases, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, ovarian cancer and renal failure. Researchers involved with Human Protein Atlas projects, are sharing protocols and method details in an open-access group on protocols.io. Collaborations The Human Protein Atlas program has participated in 9 EU research projects ENGAGE, PROSPECTS, BIO_NMD, AFFINOMICS, CAGEKID, EURATRANS, ITFoM, DIRECT and PRIMES.

Anita and her sister Emilie were however baptized and raised as Lutherans, in accordance with the social norms of assimilated upper middle class and upper class Jewish families in Germany at the time.Dick/Sassenberg: J√ºdische Frauen im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert. S. 308Kirchengemeinde St. Ansgar Self-portrait (c.1910) From 1905, she studied with the Hamburg painter Arthur Siebelist. In 1906, she met Max Liebermann, who recognized her talent and encouraged her to continue her artistic career. Around 1910 she, Franz N√∂lken and others formed a studio community, but it broke up due to her unrequited love for N√∂lken. During the winter of 1912‚Äì1913, she studied with Fernand L√©ger in Paris. In 1913, she participated in a major showing at the Galerie Commeter in Hamburg. From around 1914, Anita R√©e gained recognition as a portrait painter. In 1919, she joined the \\"Hamburg Secession\\", modeled on similar groups in Berlin and Munich. In 1921, she toured the Tyrol. From 1922 to 1925, her primary residence was in Positano. She returned to Hamburg in 1926 and helped found , an association of women artists. She also created several murals in public buildings, but most were later destroyed by the Nazi government. In 1930, she received a commission to create a triptych for the altar at the new Ansgarkirche in Langenhorn. The church fathers were not happy with her designs, however, and the commission was withdrawn in 1932 over \\"religious concerns\\". Meanwhile, the Nazis had denounced her as a Jew and the Hamburg Art Association called her an \\"alien\\". Shortly after, she moved to Sylt. She committed suicide in 1933, partly as a result of having been subjected to such hostility and continuing harassment by antisemitic forces, partly due to disappointments on the personal level. In a note to her sister, she decried the insanity of the world. In 1937, the Nazis designated R√©e's work as \\"Degenerate art\\" and began purging it from museum collections. Wilhelm Werner, a groundskeeper at the Kunsthalle Hamburg preserved many of R√©e's paintings by hiding them in his apartment.

History  Services available on EARN/BITNET included electronic mail, file transfer, real-time terminal messages, and access to EARN server machines which provided information retrieval services. Gateways existed from EARN to the ARPA Internet (ARPANET, MILNET, NSFNET, CSNET, X25Net), CSNET, UUCP, JANET (Great Britain's Joint Academic Network), and more than 10 other national academic and research networks. There also was limited access to VNET, IBM's internal communications network. At the network layer EARN was based on a \\"store-and-forward\\" technology. In a \\"store-and-forward\\" network information is sent to an intermediate node where it is kept and sent as soon as possible to the next node on the path to its final destination. The intermediate node verifies the integrity of the message before forwarding it. Each time the intermediate node confirms the receipt of the data the originating node deletes it. The EARN \\"store-and-forward\\" system was originally based on IBM's technology and used the Remote Spooling Communications Subsystem (RSCS) and NJE/NJI protocols on the IBM Virtual Machine (VM) mainframe operating systems, and JES2 (and later JES3, Job Entry Subsystem) on IBM MVS mainframe operating systems. At the physical layer the network backbone initially comprised a set of dedicated telephone circuits connected via pairs of synchronous modems with speed varying from 1.2kbit/s to 9.6kbit/s. Each country in Europe managed its own national backbone, which was then connected via one international circuit to the European backbone. Through most of the 1980s the entire traffic between the European backbone and the United States BITNET backbone was carried over a single 4.8kbit/s circuit and afterward, for quite some time, over a single 9.6kbit/s circuit using a pair of IBM synchronous modems. Later in the late 1980s, the backbone bandwidth was gradually augmented to accommodate for the increased traffic; but, given the very high prices for dedicated telephone circuits at the time, it became soon clear EARN could no longer afford a dedicated European backbone. Since the IBM sponsorship of international and transatlantic lines had stopped in fact each European country member of EARN, typically the organization in charge of each national academic network, was paying its own line to connect to the European backbone and was sharing the cost of the transatlantic connectivity via the EARN annual contribution.  Activities  A technology called VMNET was released in April 1989 at Princeton University, allowing NJE network links to operate over circuits using TCP/IP as the underlying protocol. VMNET was first used in Europe in December 1989.http://www.chilton- computing.org.uk/ccd/networking/bryant/earn_exec/90EXEC1/90EXEC16.htm It opened the door for EARN to share the same physical circuits used by the other organizations connecting to the Internet.ftp://nic.funet.fi/pub/netinfo/CREN/brfc0002.text This link, along with the March 1990 link between CERN and NSFNET over the TAT-8 cable helped pave the way for the acceptance of Internet protocols in Europe by 1992. After the advent of EBONE EARN canceled its private line to the USA at the end of 1991, invested the money into EBONE, and was able to use EBONE to carry its traffic around Europe and across the Atlantic, drastically reducing the network cost for its members and granting to all EARN countries access to a total of 4.5Mb (at the time a fairly large amount) redundant connectivity to the US.

Other works that quoted or otherwise used the anthem, such as Tchaikovsky's Marche Slave and 1812 Overture, were also revised, due to an official Soviet ban on the anthem. Starting with Dmitri Medvedev‚Äôs inauguration in 2008, an abbreviated version of this piece is played during the Russian presidential inauguration accompanying the entrance of the incoming president.

Species in this genus were part of the first placental evolutionary radiation during the Middle Eocene (48-40 mya) and found in the Bracklesham Group and Wittering Formation of England, at the Messel Pit in Germany and in Bouxwiller, France.  Description  Buxolestes were otter-like freshwater fish predators with a body length reaching about and a tail about long. They were significantly smaller than most living species of otters. Fossilized stomach contents confirm their semiaquatic freshwater habits. The anatomy of these archaic \\"insectivorous\\" mammals is known through well-preserved Middle Eocene specimens found at Messel in Germany. Their structure evidences a clear adaptation to a semiaquatic way of life. The forelimbs and hindlimbs are powerful and show strong claws. The tail is clearly fit for swimming. The skull is long, with large molars that appear to be adapted to a diet of molluscs with shells (freshwater clams and freshwater snails), but the predilection postulated from the dentition has not been confirmed.

It was built between 1881 and 1884 according to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res, the fort was built exclusively of unreinforced concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. The fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Li√®ge in World War I and again at the opening of World War II. It is now an industrial site, used for the storage and testing of rocket propellant. Description The Fort d'√âvegn√©e is located about east of the center of Li√®ge near the community of √âvegn√©e-Tign√©e. With the Fort de Fl√©ron, √âvign√©e protects the Hesbaye plain and rail access from the direction of Aachen, as well as the Herv√© road.Donnell, pp. 32-33 The fort forms an isosceles triangle whose base is long and whose sides measure . A deep by ditch encircles the fort. The principal armament was concentrated in the central massif. The ditches were defended in enfilade by 57mm guns in casemates resembling counterscarp batteries, firing at shot traps at the other end of the ditch. It is one of the smaller forts of Li√®ge. With the exception of the Fort de Loncin, the Belgian forts made little provision for the daily needs of their wartime garrisons, locating latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue in the fort's counterscarp, a location that would be untenable in combat. This would have profound effects on the forts' ability to endure a long assault. The service areas were placed directly opposite the barracks, which opened into the ditch in the rear of the fort (i.e., in the face towards Li√®ge), with lesser protection than the two \\"salient\\" sides. The Brialmont forts placed a weaker side to the rear to allow for recapture by Belgian forces from the rear, and located the barracks and support facilities on this side, using the rear ditch for light and ventilation of living spaces. In combat heavy shellfire made the rear ditch untenable, and German forces were able to get between the forts and attack them from the rear.Donnell, p. 36 The Brialmont forts were designed to be protected from shellfire equaling their heaviest guns: 21 cm.Donnell, p. 52 The top of the central massif used of unreinforced concrete, while the caserne walls, judged to be less exposed, used .Donnell, p. 12 Under fire, the forts were damaged by 21 cm fire and could not withstand heavier artillery.Donnell, pp. 45-48 Armament √âvegn√©e's armament included a Gr√ºsonwerke turret with a single 21 cm Krupp gun, a15cm Creusot turret with twin guns and two 12 cm Ch√¢tillon-Commentry turrets with two Krupp guns, all for distant targets. Four Gr√ºsonwerke 57 mm gun turrets were provided for local defense. The fort also mounted an observation turret with a searchlight. Nine rapid-fire 57 mm guns were provided in casemates for the defense of the ditches and the postern. The fort's heavy guns were German, typically Krupp, while the turret mechanisms were from a variety of sources. The fort was provided with signal lights to permit communication with the neighboring Fort de Barchon and Fort de Fl√©ron. The guns were fired using black powder rather than smokeless powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.Donnell, p. 17 First World War The Li√®ge forts Li√®ge first came under attack on 5 August 1914, with the intervals around √âvegn√©e the scene of some of the heaviest fighting. When the Li√®ge's fortifications proved unexpectedly stubborn, the Germans brought heavy siege artillery to bombard the forts with shells far larger than they were designed to resist. √âvegn√©e was one of the first targets. It was heavily bombarded starting 10 August, continuing until 0450 hours on 11 August. The fort surrendered at 1530, having lost its ability to resist.Donnell, p. 47 Occupying the fort during the remainder of the war, Germans made a number of improvements to the fort in 1914 and 1915. Fortified Position of Li√®ge √âvegn√©e's armament was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the Fortified Position of Li√®ge II, which was planned to deter a German incursion over the nearby border.Donnell, pp. 55-56 The armament was upgraded with new guns in the turrets and an anti-aircraft battery. This was accompanied by improvements to ventilation, protection, sanitary facilities, communications and electrical power. An infantry shelter with an automatic rifle cloche was built at this time, as well as a remote air intake tower some distance away from fort, linked to the fort by a tunnel. The air intake survives, and is in particularly good condition. Second World War √âvegn√©e was attacked by German forces starting 16 May 1940, holding out until it surrendered on 19 May. Present √âvegn√©e is owned and used by the Forges de Zeebrugge for storage and testing of rocket propellant, and is not accessible to the public. The fort was purchased by FZ in 1971 and was stripped of military equipment before its conversion References  Bibliography  *Donnell, Clayton, The Forts of the Meuse in World War I, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2007, . *Kauffmann, J.E., Jurga, R., Fortress Europe: European Fortifications of World War II, Da Capo Press, USA, 2002, .

It was described by Robert Broom from a frontlet and horn core from Haagenstad (now known as Florisbad), which Broom believed to be an intermediate form between lechwe and waterbuck. However others have failed to find justification for separating the species from Kobus leche. It formerly occurred in the North West, Gauteng, Free State, Northern Cape, and Eastern Cape Provinces of South Africa.Brain, CK. 1981. The Hunters or the Hunted? An Introduction to African Cave Taphonomy. University of Chicago Press.Howell, FC. & Bourliere, F. 1964. African Ecology and Human Evolution. Routledge. Like the other subspecies within the Kobus leche group, the Cape lechwe inhabited extensive marshlands, fens and alluvial flooded grasslands that flourished across the vast plains of the aforementioned Provinces of the Republic of South Africa in the not so distant past. The estimated southern limit of Cape lechwe range within the Eastern Cape Province seems to have been the central plateau that is the South African Highveld, in the environs of Cradock and Tarkastad. The Cape lechwe stood between 90 and 100 centimetres at the shoulder and topped the scale at between 70 and 120 kilograms. In all probability they were marked similarly to the red lechwe Kobus l. leche subspecies, being golden brown with a white belly. Therefore, males were darker in colour, but the general hue of their hide varied depending on the southern ecotypical cline. The long spiral structured horns were vaguely lyre-shaped, and were found only in males. Their hind legs were somewhat longer in proportion than in other antelopes, as with all subspecies within the Kobus leche group, to ease long-distance running in moist, inundated, and marshy soils. Habitat The Cape lechwe, as with the other extant subspecies, were highly specialized in their habitat requirements, with water being at the center of their existence. This being the case, lechwe in general rarely venture further than say 2 to 3 kilometres from a permanent water source. Their characteristic haunt, as with the extant subspecies, were shallow inundated floodplains on the periphery of rivers, lakes and swamps, and especially on the ecotone that these habitats form with papyrus Cyperus papyrus, both Phragmites australis and Phragmites mauritianus reeds, and tall aquatic grasses. These habitats in addition to knee-deep water were used as protection against predators. Their legs are covered in a water repelling substance allowing them to run quite fast in knee-deep water.Skinner, JD and Chimba, CT. 2005. The Mammals of the Southern African Subregion, 3rd edition. Cambridge University Press. Lechwe are diurnal. They gather in herds which can include many thousands of individuals. Herds are usually all of one sex but during mating season they mix.

From 1890 to 1892 Charles-Eug√®ne worked as a Privatdozent (lecturer) in Geneva, and from 1893 to 1900 he was a Privatdozent at Zurich Polytechnic (now the Federal Institute of Technology Zurich ETH Zurich), switching his research interests to electrical engineering. Albert Einstein was one of his students. From 1900 to 1930 he was professor and director of the Physics Institute of the University of Geneva. His research focus was in the fields of electric currents, magnetism, and electrical discharges in gases. Starting in 1907 and continuing for over a decade, he and his students Simon Ratnowsky and Charles Lavanchy conducted experiments that demonstrated the dependence of the electron mass on its speed, with results supporting the predictions of Lorentz, Einstein, and the special theory of relativity against Max Abraham's rival theory of the electron. He participated in the 5th and 7th Solvay Conferences, and was the author or co-author of over 200 papers in physics and several popular books, including philosophical works on the biological-physical-chemical basis of evolution and the limits of physics and biology.

Before he became Vice Chancellor, he served as Deputy Vice Chancellor at UoN, responsible for Finance and Administration. Early life and education Mbithi was born in Kangundo, Machakos County. In 1983, he obtained a Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine, from the University of Nairobi. In 1985, he obtained a Master of Science degree in Veterinary Clinical Studies, also from the UoN. Two years later he was awarded his third degree, a Master of Veterinary Science, by the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. He attended a residency course at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, from 1986 until 1987. His fourth and terminal degree, a Doctor of Philosophy, was obtained from the University of Nairobi in 1995. His thesis was on studies on pseudoarthrosis of the bovine metacarpophalangeal joints. His research interests are clinical veterinary medicine and orthopedic surgery, wounding and traumatology with special interest in lameness, joint surgery and arthritides.  Career Prior to his appointment as Vice Chancellor, Mbithi was a professor of Veterinary Medicine, at the UoN. He held various administrative posts there, including Chairman of the Department of Veterinary Clinical Studies, Dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Studies and Principal of the College of Veterinary Sciences. In his position as Vice Chancellor, Mbithi frequently acted as the University's media spokesperson and was called upon to speak at formal events. He also served as chair of the Inter-Public Universities Councils Consultative Forum (IPUCCF) Negotiations Committee during staff salary negotiations. In 2015 he was in the news because of disagreements with his deputy vice chancellor, who was subsequently recommended for dismissal. In 2016 Mbithi was threatened with ejection from the Kenya Universities Staff Union over disagreements about staff employment benefits. He was also the target of student protests over the university's policies concerning student residences. In the end, the University Council of the UoN, rejected Mbithi's request for a contract extension. The Council then directed him to proceed on terminal leave in July 2019, six months before the expiry of his contractual tenure. He was replaced in acting capacity by Professor Isaac Mbeche, until a substantive vice-chancellor is appointed.

Biography  Amariglio was born and raised in the East New York section of Brooklyn, where he graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School (Brooklyn). He earned a B.A. in history from the City College of New York in 1973. He received his Ph.D. in 1984 from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. His dissertation was titled \\"Economic History and the Theory of Primitive Socio-Economic Development\\". In 1988, Amariglio joined efforts with a group of colleagues to launch Rethinking Marxism, an academic journal that aims to create a platform for rethinking and developing Marxian concepts and theories within economics as well as other fields of social inquiry. He served as the founding editor of the journal until 1997 and continues to serve as a member of both the editorial as well as the advisory boards of the journal. As a graduate student employee at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, he was instrumental in the institution of Economics Graduate Student Organization (EGSO), as a democratically run collective body of graduate students. EGSO, to this day, serves as a forum and representative body of graduate students and distributes the teaching assignments to graduate students in an egalitarian manner.

In December 2014, Vallex Group launched production operations at the mine, which is a US$380 million project. In February 2018 Vallex Group published a statement announcing suspension of all operations and laying off nearly all staff. The mine was expected become comparable in size to the Kajaran Mine in southern Armenia.  Available deposits and value  The Teghut forest lies atop ore deposits containing an estimated 1.6 million tons of copper and about 100,000 tons of molybdenum. In 2010, with the price of copper at US$7,500 per ton and molybdenum at US$35,000 per ton, this amounts to about US$12 billion in copper and US$3.5 billion in molybdenum. Therefore, the total value of the mine's deposits was about $15.5 billion in 2010.  Mine financing and ownership  Vallex, which is run and at least partly owned by Russian-Armenian businessman Valeri Mejlumyan, claims to have already invested almost $340 million in Teghut. It has borrowed the bulk of that money from VTB, a leading Russian bank. In 2013, the company also attracted $62 million in funding from a Danish pension fund which was due to be partly or fully channeled into purchases of metallurgical equipment from another Danish company, FLSmidth. In 2017, the Danish state credit agency decided to withdraw export credit guarantees to mine operators, accusing its private owner of failing to comply with environmental standards.  Notable incidents, statements and events  = Assessments before opening = Pre- project reports indicated that open-pit mining at Teghut will lead to the destruction of 357 hectares of rich forest, including 128,000 trees. Environmentalists claimed that ore crushing and enrichment will also pollute a local river and underground waters. = 2014 - Statements by the mine operator = Vallex claimed to have created about 1,300 new jobs and pledged to build new schools and upgrade infrastructure in nearby villages.

It is the directing debut film of Pawan K Shrivastava. Naya Pata is a cinema which tries to capture the emotional insight of a person during migration. It is the first independent film from Bihar which is being produced through crowd funding. Vaartul films and Nayaab Vision Entertainment Private limited has produced Naya Pata and it was released by PVR Director's Cut on 27 June. According to Shrivastava, \\"Naya Pata is based on the issue of migration and its pain since last three decades in Bihar. It‚Äôs a story of the identity lost and found. It‚Äôs based on the backdrop of the closure of sugar industry in Bihar during 1985-1990. It also talks about the modern and contemporary Bihar.\\" Saket Saurabh was the cinematographer.  Synopsis  Naya Pata is a film about the struggle of a man to re-establish his lost identity and loneliness. Instead of emphasizing on migration, the film mainly talks about the intangible things that happen to a person when he migrates from one place to other, such as loneliness, loss of Identity and sense of belongingness. It talks about the intangible consequences of the migration. We have tried to tell the emotions of a migrated person, through his silence and behavior. Film opens in 1985‚Äì1990, a period when the sugar industry in Bihar was facing a lock-out due to some clashes between labor and trade unions. Many of the sugar factories were locked out and Ram Swarath Dubey, the protagonist of the film who used to work in the mill became jobless. Now he is left with no other option rather than migrating to a new place, i.e., New Delhi. Finally he comes to Delhi leaving behind her newly married wife. He gets a job in law firm and started working. As he started living in the city the feeling of loneliness was wandering around him. Delhi is a new world to him and in the course of time he finds himself torn between two worlds. Whenever he visits his native place, even there he feels no peace because nothing remains permanent for him. The moment when he is at home, he gets worried about the day he has to leave and when he returns to Delhi, he is again lost in the memories of home. Lost between these two worlds, he spent 25 years of his life in Delhi. He is now feeling that he should return to his village, as his only son become young and married. He was thinking to take care of remaining members of the family as he has lost his wife, father, mother... all one by one, which he could only feel now but can't live it. And finally he comes back to his village after a long period of 30 Years. He comes with a hope that his own people will give him a warm welcome and he will live rest of his life with peace and real identity. But as soon as he comes to his native place, he started facing the issue of identity loss right from the beginning. His identity is lost and now he is neither a village man nor he remains a Delhiite. He tries his best to establish his lost identity. But one day his only son informed him about his plan to migrate Nasik for a job as there is no work or employment left at their residing place. Ram Swarath Dubey was left without any answer, as it reminds him his young age when his father asked him to migrate to Delhi. Again, the situation is same and nothing has still changed. When his son Jitendar leaves for Nasik, Ram Swarath Dubey finds that his daughter-in-law stuck to the same condition as his wife used to be in, the loneliness. Ram Swarath Dubey meets a girl Sandhya, who is pass-out from a college in Patna and planning to go to Delhi for higher education. Ram Swarath feels that migration is stealing everyone's identity, and in his own village there are many people that have migrated to different states for the search of bread and butter. Ram Swarath Dubey is deeply hurt by seeing this situation. But he doesn't lose his hope and still thinks that one day everything will change and people will return to their native place. He takes a decision to send her daughter-in-law to Nasik along with his son because he doesn't want her to live same life as his wife has lived. Once his son and daughter ‚Äìin-law left for Nasik, he was again living alone in the village. Now he is feeling the same loneliness again that he was feeling during his long stay in Delhi. But still he has a hope that everything will change and one day his son will return. He is still positive and start believing in government as there is political change in the state. But one night he broke out and became restless where he could see his death and loneliness. He tries his best to find a solution and finally he gets an alternative of his fear and story comes to the climax. The story leaves some questions still unanswered.

The judgment hinged on the interpretation of the Employment Standards Act and has been taken to mark the Supreme Court of Canada's adoption of the purposive approach to legislative interpretation. It has since been frequently cited in subsequent decisions of Canadian courts, nearly every time legislation is interpreted. Background Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. filed for bankruptcy; employees subsequently lost their jobs. The company paid all wages, salaries, commissions, and vacation pay through termination. The Ministry of Labour for the Province of Ontario audited the company to ensure that no further payments were owed to former employees under the Employment Standards Act (ESA). Proof of claim was submitted to a trustee, who subsequently disallowed the claim. According to the trustee, a company's bankruptcy does not constitute dismissal from employment; thus, the former employees of Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes gained no positive right to severance, termination or vacation pay under the ESA. The case went before the Ontario Court (General Division) where the judge agreed with the Ministry of Labour and allowed the former employees to be paid. However, the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the ruling and restored the Trustee's decision. The Ministry sought leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal judgment but discontinued its application. Following the discontinuance of the appeal, the Trustee paid a dividend to Rizzo's creditors, thereby leaving significantly less funds in the estate. Subsequently, the appellants, five former employees of Rizzo, moved to set aside the discontinuance, add themselves as parties to the proceedings, and requested and were granted an order granting them leave to appeal. Ruling In the unanimous decision, the Supreme Court allowed the employees' appeal holding that they were entitled to the payments. While the plain language of the Act seemed to suggest that termination pay and severance pay were payable only when the employer terminates the employment, the Court held that the words of an Act must be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. Iacobucci J. wrote: Elmer Driedger in Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983) best encapsulates the approach upon which I prefer to rely. He recognizes that statutory interpretation cannot be founded on the wording of the legislation alone. At p. 87 he states Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. (Re Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para 21, quoting E. A. Driedger, The Construction of Statutes (2nd ed 1983), at p. 87) The Court of Appeal had failed to read the language of the Act in this broad manner the Supreme Court held. It noted that the purpose of the termination and severance pay provisions were to protect employees, to recognize their service and investment in the employer's enterprise and to cushion them against the adverse effects of economic dislocation. To hold that (more junior) employees terminated prior to bankruptcy would be entitled to termination and severance pay while (more senior) employees terminated upon bankruptcy would be absurd, the Court held: :The trial judge properly noted that, if the ESA termination and severance pay provisions do not apply in circumstances of bankruptcy, those employees ‚Äúfortunate‚Äù enough to have been dismissed the day before a bankruptcy would be entitled to such payments, but those terminated on the day the bankruptcy becomes final would not be so entitled. In my view, the absurdity of this consequence is particularly evident in a unionized workplace where seniority is a factor in determining the order of lay-off. The more senior the employee, the larger the investment he or she has made in the employer and the greater the entitlement to termination and severance pay. However, it is the more senior personnel who are likely to be employed up until the time of the bankruptcy and who would thereby lose their entitlements to these payments. The Court also held that the legislative history of the termination and severance pay provisions and the other provisions in the ESA supported an interpretation that such benefits were payable to employees whose employment is terminated upon bankruptcy. The Court also ordered the Ministry of Labour to pay the employees' costs, since it had not provided the Court with any evidence as to the effort it made to notify or secure the consent of the Rizzo employees before it discontinued its application for leave to appeal to this Court on their behalf.

Its subject is ancient polychromy, i.e. the original, brightly-painted, appearance of ancient sculpture and architecture.  Concept  The Greek goddess Artemis, color reconstruction of a first century AD statue found in Pompeii, an imitation of Greek statues of the sixth century BC, reconstructed using analysis of trace pigments The exhibition is based on the conclusions drawn from research on ancient polychromy, conducted especially by the Classical archaeologist Vinzenz Brinkmann since the early 1980s, based on earlier works by Volkmar von Graeve. Working together with Raimund W√ºnsche, the director of the Glyptothek at Munich, Brinkmann developed the concept for the exhibition, culminating in the original Munich show in 2003. It displayed copies of ancient sculpture in their reconstructed and painted appearance that had been produced during his studies, as well as new reconstructions created especially for the exhibition, in conjunction with the originals or comparable ancient sculptures. Soon, the exhibition began to travel to other cities in Germany and beyond. Since 2007, the exhibition and underlying research has received support from a foundation created by the government of Bavaria, as well as private donations. After the original German catalogue produced for the 2003 Munich exhibition, new editions were issued for later showings, most recently for the 2010 one in Berlin. An English catalogue was published for the 2007-2008 showing in the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard University. In 2007, the Colored Gods formed part of the exhibition, Color of Life ‚Äì Polychromy in Sculpture from Antiquity to the Present, at the Getty Villa in Los Angeles, with contributions in the respective catalogue.

Chesquerque is a chess variant invented by George R. Dekle Sr. in 1986. The game is played on a board equaling four Alquerque boards combined, and like Alquerque, pieces move along marked lines (9√ó9) to the points of intersection (81 points). All the standard chess pieces are present, plus one additional pawn and one archbishop fairy piece per side. The pieces move in ways specially adapted to the Alquerque-gridded board. Chesquerque was included in World Game Review No. 10 edited by Michael Keller. Game rules The illustration shows the starting setup. White moves first and the object is checkmate. Other standard chess conventions apply as well, but piece moves are specially adapted to the Alquerque-gridded board. Pieces move only along marked lines, and rest on the points of intersection. =Piece moves= * A rook moves orthogonally any number of points in a straight line. A rook on a point having one or more diagonal connections can also move one step diagonally. * A bishop on a point having one or more diagonal connections moves diagonally any number of points in a straight line. A bishop can also move one step orthogonally. * The queen moves as a Chesquerque rook and a Chesquerque bishop. * The king moves one step as a Chesquerque queen. When castling, the king slides three points' distance whether castling (0-0) or (0-0-0). * A knight on a point having no diagonal connections moves in the pattern: one step orthogonally, followed by one step diagonally outward. A knight on a point having one or more diagonal connections moves in the pattern: one step diagonally, followed by one step orthogonally outward. Unlike a chess knight, the Chesquerque knight may not jump an intervening man. * The archbishop moves as a Chesquerque bishop and a Chesquerque knight. On a single turn it may move as only one of those pieces‚Äînot both. * A pawn on a point having no diagonal connections moves and captures one step forward. A pawn on a point having one or more diagonal connections moves one step straight forward, and captures one step diagonally forward. As in chess, pawns may optionally advance two steps straight forward on their first move, en passant captures are possible, and promotion occurs at the last .

Otis (ed.), 'Scituate and Barnstable Church Records', New England Historical and Genealogical Register Vol. 9 (July 1855), pp. 279‚Äì87, at p. 279. (Google). Lothropp's record shows that \\"My sonn Fuller and my daughter Jane, and Edward Foster and Lettice Handford, marr[ie]d att Mr Cudworths by Captaine Standige Aprill 8 ye 4th day of the weeke 1635\\",A.

Cudworth's first children were born at Scituate: James (3 May 1635), Mary (1637), and Jonathan (1638; who died in infancy).A. Otis (ed.), 'Scituate and Barnstable Church Records', New England Historical and Genealogical Register Vol. 9 (July 1855), pp. 279‚Äì87, at p. 281. In October 1636, the Plymouth General Court appointed William Brewster, James Cudworth, and several other prominent citizens to a special committee which was to join with the Governor (and Assistant Governors) in reviewing all laws, with proposed changes to laws being presented at the next court meeting.E.A. Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì91 (Salt Lake City: 1986), p. 143 =Removal to Barnstable, Plymouth Colony (1638‚Äì46)= The removal of some part of the Scituate population to a new plantation at Barnstable was advocated to the Governor, Thomas Prence (then in his second term), in two letters by John Lothropp (1638‚Äì39). The causes appear to have included a split in the Scituate congregation concerning Lothropp's views on baptism.Huntington, Lo-Lathropp Memoir, pp. 28‚Äì31. In reproducing the letters from John Lathrop's 'Biographical Memoir of Rev. John Lothropp', Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society Series 2 Vol. 1 (Boston 1814), pp. 163‚Äì78, at pp. 171‚Äì75, Huntington follows the reversed sequence, by which the letter of September (Seventh month) 28, 1638 is placed after that of February 18, 1638 (Old Style), which fell in 1639 by modern reckoning. James Cudworth and his family were among those who removed to Barnstable (taking with them their crops from Scituate). They arrived (October 11, 1639), and were listed there (1640) as amongst the first settlers.'The First Settlers of Barnstable,' New England Historical and Genealogical Register Vol. 2 (January 1848), pp. 64‚Äì67. Their younger children, Israel (1641), Joanna (1643), an unbaptized male child (d.1644), and Jonathan (who survived) were born (or baptized) at Barnstable.A.

Shurtleff, 'List of Those Able to Bear Arms in the Colony of New Plymouth 1643,' New England Historical and Genealogical Register Vol. 4 (1850), pp. 255‚Äì59. He was in Scituate (1646), and (as the progress of the English Civil War led to Charles I's execution (1649), the Interregnum, and the declaration of the Commonwealth of England as a Republic), Cudworth became a Deputy to Plymouth General Court (from 1649), and later Captain of the Scituate Militia (1652). During this time, the sovereignty of the English Parliament, and the authority of the puritan Oliver Cromwell, as Lord Protector (1653‚Äì8), enlarged the expectations of the puritan colonial legislature. Both Captain James Cudworth and his friend Timothy Hatherly were appointed as supervisors of the last will and testament (7 March 1655/56) of Myles Standish (d.1656) of Duxbury, Massachusetts, and Cudworth was also a witness to this will. Standish was a Mayflower colonist of 1620, had been Plymouth Militia's first Captain (1621‚Äì56), and was a leading figure in Plymouth Colony (he died on October 3, 1656).Text of will in C.H. Simmons, Jr., Plymouth Colony Records, Vol. 1: Wills and Inventories 1633‚Äì69 (Picton Press, Camden, ME, 1996), pp. 312‚Äì14E.A. Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì91 (Salt Lake City: 1986), p. 358 In 1657, James Cudworth and Thomas Prence became the two Plymouth Commissioners (of eight, in all, from the four colonies) of the United Colonies of New England (or New England Confederation), (an alliance for the strengthening of the Puritan colonies and their defense against the Native Americans). Cudworth served as Assistant Governor (1656‚Äì8), during a time which saw the end of William Bradford's last term of office (June 3, 1657) and the commencement of the third and lengthy administration of Thomas Prence (1657‚Äì73). =Stand against persecution (1657‚Äì73)= In September 1657, the Commissioners issued a letter, to the authorities of Rhode Island, demanding the suppression of the Quakers; of all the Commissioners, Cudworth alone refused to sign.J.B. Felt, The Ecclesiastical History of New England, 2 vols (Congregational Library Association, Boston 1855, 1862), II, p. 170 (Hathi Trust). In December (tenth month, Old Style) 1658, he wrote a long letter (to a person in England), in which he provided details of the brutally harsh and (as he considered) illegal laws and punishments meted out to the Quakers (and others) who the Puritan monopoly in the colonial legislature wished to purge.R.P. Hallowell, The Quaker Invasion of Massachusetts (Houghton, Mifflin & Co, Boston/Riverside Press, Cambridge 1883), pp. 162‚Äì72. He reported that this \\"Antichristian Persecuting Spirit\\" had been at work during the previous two years (during his magistracy), and that he had often had to object to such proceedings (though in a respectful manner). His objections had given rise to a petition against him (signed by 19 people, who complained that he had entertained Quakers at his house). This, he admitted, he had done to acquaint himself with Quaker principles (rather than to condemn them out of prejudice); and he found that he disagreed with the Quakers on various matters, and told the court, which heard the petition (presided over by Thomas Prence), that he was no Quaker: but that, just \\"as I was no Quaker, so I will be no Persecutor\\".Hallowell, Quaker Invasion, pp. 162‚Äì63. When the Act of Court was read before the people at Scituate (and before the Scituate Military Company (of which he was head)), there was a great disturbance against him, which he brought under control by making a speech. Consequently, a fresh petition was brought (signed by 54 hands), to which the court answered respectfully that Cudworth was a very useful and accomplished person, and that the only point against him was his association with Quakers (One or other of these petitions from \\"sundry persons from the towne of Scituate\\" was noted in the General Court (March 2, 1657/58)). In consequence of this, he and his friend Hatherly had been removed from the Bench at the previous election, and Cudworth himself was relieved of his military command (with Lt James Torrey and Ensign John Williams subsequently ordered to assume command of the company).E.A. Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì91 (Salt Lake City: 1986), pp. 91, 164. The persecutions to which Cudworth referred were (he stated) fuelled by the actions of the Boston legislature (then led by John Endecott).Hallowell, Quaker Invasion, at p. 165. Cudworth's uncle, Israel Stoughton (d.1644), had worked with Endecott during the period of the Antinomian Controversy surrounding Anne Hutchinson, but had returned to England. Israel's son, William Stoughton (later involved in the Salem witch trials) was, during the 1650s, also resident in England. It was the voyage from England of the Speedwell in 1656 (which brought eight Quakers who were immediately imprisoned and expelled),C.F. Holder, The Holders of Holderness. A History and Genealogy of the Holder Family with especial reference to Christopher Holder (Author, California (1902)), pp. 22‚Äì26. Read here. The text includes a full transcript of the original 1656 shipping list in the Massachusetts Colonial Records: the eight were Christopher Holder (25), William Brend (40), John Copeland (28), Thomas Thurston (34), Mary Prince (21), Sarah Gibbons (21), Mary Weatherhead (26), Dorothy Waugh (20). and of the Woodhouse in 1657, and the subsequent renewal of their attempts to enter the Massachusetts Bay Colony from Rhode Island or Barbados, which now aroused the Puritan hostility. The treatment of Quakers (such as Christopher Holder, who was flogged, imprisoned, and had an ear cut-off) under Boston laws (and their law of banishment on pain of death), whipped up similar fervor elsewhere in the United Colonies in imitation: laws were emended retrospectively so that even minor actions of dissent and, of course, the Quaker refusal to take oaths were punishable by cumulative fines and imprisonments resulting in the eprivation of livelihood.Hallowell, Quaker Invasion, at pp. 166‚Äì69. Cudworth noted the strong influence of Quakerism upon the people of Sandwich, in Barnstable County. At the time of the petitions against Cudworth (March 1657/58),Felt, Ecclesiastical History of New England, II, p. 234 the Rhode Island Assembly (upholding their principle of freedom of consciences) rebuked the United Colonies Commissioners for their demand concerning preventing the admission of Quakers, and warned that any subsequent civil troubles should be referred to \\"The Supream Authority of England\\".T.W. Bicknell, The History of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations Vol. III (The American Historical Society, Inc., New York 1920), pp. 1024‚Äì25. (Hathi Trust) Cudworth's letter, written weeks after the death of Oliver Cromwell (September 3, 1658), naming the relevant members of the legislature and accusing them of arbitrary legislation outside the principles of English law,Hallowell, Quaker Invasion, at pp. 169‚Äì71. may reflect this intention. For disobedience to their laws, the Boston authorities executed: William Robinson and Marmaduke Stephenson (October 1659), Mary Dyer (1 June 1660), and William Leddra (March 1661).New-England Judged, Reprint of the abbreviated 1703 edition (T. Sowle, London 1703), pp. 189‚Äì218. (Hathi Trust) In 1659, James Cudworth was sent, by Scituate, as a Deputy to the Plymouth General Court, but was not approved by the Court.E.A. Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì91 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Pub., 1986), pp. 91‚Äì92 Charged with disaffection to authority (on the evidence of a copy of his letter), he was ordered to appear before the Court (March 1660) on a bond of ¬£500, and was sentenced (6 June 1660) to be disfranchised of his freedom of Plymouth Colony, having been found a \\"manifest opposer of the laws of government\\".Felt, Ecclesiastical History of New England, II, pp. 243‚Äì44 (Hathi Trust). In October 1660, he was questioned concerning a letter of reply received from John Browne of Frampton.Felt, Ecclesiastical History of New England, II, p. 246 (Hathi Trust). In the light of the information which reached England, a lengthy indictment of the persecutions against Quakers in New England was published in London by George Bishop, entitled New-England Judged (1661),George Bishop, New England judged, not by man's, but the spirit of the Lord: and the summe sealed up of New-England's persecutions. Being a brief relation of the sufferings of the people called Quakers in those parts of America, from the beginning of the moneth 1656. (the time of their first arrival at Boston from England) to the later end of the tenth moneth, 1660. In answer to a certain printed paper, intituled, A declaration of the general court of the Massachusetts holden at Boston, the 18. October, 1658. Apologizing for the same. (Robert Wilson, 1661). with a supplement describing the sufferings of the martyrs,An Appendix to the Book, entituled, New England Judged: being certain writings of those persons (W. Robinson and M. Stephenson; M. Dyar and W. Leddra) which were there executed. Together with a short relation of the trial ... and execution of W. Leddra (London 1661). and a full second part was published in 1667.G. Bishop, New England Judged. The second part. Being a relation of the cruel and bloody sufferings of the people called Quakers, in the jurisdiction chiefly of the Massachusetts, etc. (London, 1667). The first volume (1661) of Bishop's work included the first publication of Cudworth's letter:New-England Judged, vol. 1 (1661), pp. 128‚Äì34 (Umich/eebo). it was this, therefore, which may have been influential in causing Charles II (following the Restoration of the English Monarchy (1660)), to issue \\"The King's Missive\\" (9 September 1661), which required that any Quakers held by them under sentence of death or other corporeal punishment should forthwith not be proceeded against, but should be returned (at once) to England where the charges against them might be considered according to English law.New-England Judged, Reprint of the abbreviated 1703 edition (T. Sowle, London 1703), p. 214. (Hathi Trust) Before this, in March 1660/61, Cudworth's elder daughter, Mary, had married the Quaker, Robert Whitcomb, and had been fined for disorderly marriage and for choosing each other without parental consent. They were, however, permitted to marry in orderly fashion (the principal objection being to Mr Henry Hobson, who had derided their authority by the counterfeit solemnization).Felt, Ecclesiastical History of New England, II, pp. 313, 325 (Hathi Trust). In 1665, Cudworth's eldest son, James, also married a Quaker, Mary Howland, and they were fined for fornication (Cudworth's consent or otherwise is not noted). = Rehabilitation (1673), Assistant Governor (1674‚Äì80), and Deputy Governor (1681‚Äì2) = It was not until the death of the Governor of Plymouth Colony, Thomas Prence (March 29, 1673), and the election of his long-serving Assistant, Josiah Winslow (son of the Pilgrim Edward Winslow) as Governor, that Cudworth was officially rehabilitated. In June 1666, a majority of the Scituate militia had elected Cudworth as their commander, but this choice was nullified on account of his support for Quakers and his writing against the rulers.Felt, Ecclesiastical History of New England, II, p. 387 (Hathi Trust). The Court remarked, \\"As to Mr. Cudworth it is directly against the advice of this court, and as to Mr. Pierce he is a stranger to us, therefore Sergeant Daman [i.e. John Damon] is directed to take command till further orders.\\"E.B. Sumner, Descendants of Samuel Bartlett and Lucy Jenkins (Private, Los Angeles 1951), p. 39 (Internet Archive). Governor Winslow adopted a more lenient policy towards the Quakers and, among his first actions, released Cudworth and Robinson from prison (where they had been held as sympathizers).L.S. Richards, History of Marshfield (Plymouth MA., Memorial Press, 1905), vol. 3, p. 115. Colony records show that \\"Captain Cudworth, by a full and clear vote, is accepted and reestablished in the association and body of this Commonwealth.\\" (July 4, 1673).Deane, History of Scituate, p. 248. On the same day he was appointed magistrate for Scituate, with powers to solemnize marriages, to grant subpoenas for witnesses, and to administer oaths to witnesses. Cudworth was also chosen by the Court to lead a military expedition against the Dutch at New York (1673). However, in declining this invitation, he addressed a very thoughtful letter to Governor Winslow, objecting that his wife (then aged 67) who was in poor health would be unlikely to survive during his absence, and that he lacked the capabilities demanded by such an undertaking. He was ready to serve King and Country, but wondered why the General Court should choose him over others better qualified. He contended that the \\"voice of the people\\" was not always the \\"voice of God\\", and that he did not feel that God called him to the present task. He emphasised that he was not motivated, in his refusal, by discontent arising from any former difference: he explained that he had formerly bent his mind and thoughts to military work and other public concerns, but was discharged from them: \\"and therein I took vox populi to be vox Dei, and that God did thereby call and design me to sit still and be sequestered from all publick transactions, which condition suits me so well that I have received more satisfaction and contentment therein, than ever I did in sustaining any publick place.\\"Letter of James Cudworth to Josiah Winslow, 1673, in Deane, History of Scituate, at pp. 249‚Äì50. Cudworth was chosen again as Assistant Governor (1674‚Äì80), was appointed to take charge of the Plymouth Colony military forces (1675) and, during that summer, was in charge of one-hundred Plymouth men and two-hundred Massachusetts (Bay Colony) men.E.A. Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì91 (Salt Lake City: 1986), p. 112 In December 1675, Governor Winslow became commander-in- chief of the United Colonies forces, and planned a campaign of attacks against the Indians during King Philip's War (1675‚Äì76). Cudworth, now promoted to the rank of Major, took Winslow's place as commander of all Plymouth forces,E.A. Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì91 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Pub., 1986), p. 113 and marched to the relief of Swansea with Major Thomas Savage (June 1675).Cudworth's exploits in the war are detailed by G.M.

Also inscription at the Myles Garrison House memorial, Swansea. Major Cudworth was appointed, with two others (Cornet Robert Stetson and Isaac Chittenden), by the Plymouth War Council as press masters (December 6)The press masters were not the forced press-gang of old but more like a draft board. to obtain enough fit and able Scituate men for an expedition against the Native Americans. On December 30, the council further ordered that any person pressed into the colony's service who refused to serve would pay a fine (and if his financial reseources were insufficient, he would be sent to prison for a term not to exceed six months).E.A. Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì91 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Pub., 1986), p. 114 Cudworth served as Deputy Governor (1681‚Äì2), and became an official agent for Plymouth Colony. In this capacity he was charged with a mission to travel to England to obtain a new charter (by which the colony was to incorporate part of Narragansett territory).Deane, History of Scituate, p. 250 He made his last will and testament in New England (dated at Scituate, September 15, 1681), which, since it does not mention his wife, suggests that she may have died (some time after 1673). In his will, he named his sons, James, Israel, and Jonathan; his elder daughter Mary's four children (Israel, Robert, James, and Mary Whitcomb); and his younger daughter, Joanna Jones. The will also (impossibly) left two-thirds of his lands to his eldest son, James, and one- third each to Israel and Jonathan (he may have intended that two-fourths should go to the eldest and one fourth each to the others, but this is differently explained in another source). Death (1682) and Memorial James Cudworth is said to have made his journey to England, and to have died, of smallpox, in London. An inventory of his possessions (which included books worth almost ¬£8), was compiled (June 20, 1682), and his last will and testament was proved (July 7, 1682). His burial place remains unknown (and it is possible that his body was disposed of informally owing to the nature of his illness). His wife, Mary Parker Cudworth (d. c. 1673‚Äì81), was presumably buried in Scituate (though both the date and place are unknown). A memorial stone, in his honor, was erected in the Men of Kent Cemetery in Scituate, Massachusetts,Memorial of James Cudworth IMemorial of Mary Parker Cudworth which reads: > A Memorial to Gen.

The announcement that GPs would take over this commissioning role was made in the 2010 white paper \\"Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS\\". This was part of the government's advertised desire to create a clinically-driven commissioning system that was more sensitive to the needs of patients. The 2010 white paper became law under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 in March 2012. At the end of March 2013 there were 211 CCGs. To a certain extent they replaced primary care trusts (PCTs), though some of the staff and responsibilities moved to local authority public health teams when PCTs ceased to exist in April 2013. Services directly provided by PCTs were reorganised through the Transforming Community Services programme.  Structure and membership  Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) are clinically-led groups which include all of the GP groups in their geographical area. They are supposed to work with patients and healthcare professionals and in partnership with local communities and local authorities. On their governing body, each group has, in addition to GPs, at least one registered nurse and a doctor who is a secondary care specialist. The aim of this is to give GPs and other clinicians the power to influence commissioning decisions for their patients. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 provides that the areas specified in the constitutions of clinical commissioning groups together cover the whole of England, and do not coincide or overlap. CCGs are overseen by NHS England including its Regional Offices and Area Teams. These structures manage primary care commissioning, including holding the NHS Contracts for GP practices NHS. Each CCG has a constitution and is run by its governing body. Each has to have an accountable officer responsible for the CCG's duties, functions, finance and governance. Most CCGs initially appointed former primary care trust managers to these posts. However, by October 2014, only a quarter of accountable officers were GPs, whereas 80% of CCG Chairs were GPs. By November 2014 only half of GP practices said they felt involved in CCG decision making processes. Unite the Union surveyed the 3,392 CCG board members in 2015 and reported that 513 were directors of private healthcare companies: 140 owned such businesses and 105 carried out external work for them. More than 400 CCG board members were shareholders in such companies. The King's Fund and the Nuffield Trust ran a survey of GPs in six areas of England in 2016 and found that more than 70% were at least \\"somewhat\\" engaged with the work of their CCG, though only 20% of those without a formal role in their CCG said they could influence the work of their CCG if they chose to. =Mergers= In 2013, 211 groups were established and there was resistance to any proposals for mergers between groups. On 1 April 2015 Gateshead CCG, Newcastle North & East CCG and Newcastle West CCG merged, yet in the same year, Lakeside Healthcare applied to move from Corby CCG where it had two-thirds of the registered population to Nene CCG, but Nene refused to accept it. During 2016 it appeared that further mergers would be permitted, and in November 2016 NHS England published an official procedure. In March 2017, 83 CCGs were sharing chief officers as a precursor to merger. During 2017 mergers between CCGs began, having previously been forbidden. As of August 2017 GPs in Staffordshire submitted a vote of no confidence in their local CCGs in protest against a proposed merger. The merger between Liverpool, South Sefton and Southport and Formby CCGs was stopped while an investigation into Liverpool CCG's governance and management of conflicts of interest was carried out, leading to the resignation of several of its leaders. There were similar investigations in Hackney, London and Crawley. As of April 2018, the largest CCG in England was created following the merger of NHS Birmingham Cross-City, Birmingham South Central and Solihull CCGs. The newly formed NHS Birmingham and Solihull CCG became responsible for commissioning services for over 1.3 million patients. In November 2018 NHS England announced that the administration budgets of CCGs were to be cut by 20% and that mergers, which would be approved, were a good way of saving money. For 2020, 86 mergers are planned, thus 45% of the current 191 groups. As of February 2020, there were to be 135 groups from April 2020 onward. =Relationship with local councils= In October 2017, it was announced that Brighton and Hove Clinical Commissioning Group were to merge some services with those provided by Brighton and Hove City Council, via a Health and Social Care Integration Board. The board was to commence work in April 2018 and provide full service a year later, preventing duplication of health and social care within the city. As of December 2017 the ten CCGs in Greater Manchester were in various stages of establishing a \\"single commissioning function\\" with their council.  Tasks  Each CCG is responsible for persons who are provided with primary medical services by a member of the group, and persons who usually reside in the group's area and are not provided with primary medical services by a member of any clinical commissioning group. CCGs operate by commissioning (or buying) healthcare services including: *Most community health services *Elective hospital care *Rehabilitation care *Urgent and emergency care *Mental health and learning disability services *Individual funding requests in their area. Clinical commissioning groups are responsible for arranging emergency and urgent care services within their boundaries, and for commissioning services for any unregistered patients who live in their area. All GP practices must belong to a clinical commissioning group. The area of the CCG must all be within one top-tier local authority. =Primary care= As originally established, CCGs did not have any responsibility for Primary Care which was commissioned and managed by NHS England, but in November 2014 CCGs were invited to become co- commissioners of primary care in their area, responsible for the performance management and budgets of their member GP practices, including managing complaints about practices and GPs. A delegated commissioning model was tried from 2015: As of April 2015, 63 were to take on fully delegated responsibility and 87 were to begin \\"joint commissioning\\", which involves less responsibility. The initial commissioning of primary care was done by NHS England. In 2017 it was proposed that most CCGs should take responsibility for GP contracts, as the early adopters had done well and it was \\"critical to local sustainability and transformation planning\\". As of October they were also to be able to establish new practices, approve mergers and manage 'discretionary' payments. Operation In November 2014, the London Borough of Tower Hamlets Clinical Commissioning Group, chaired by Sam Everington, was awarded Clinical Commissioning Group of the year by the Health Service Journal for \\"strong leadership, especially around clinical leadership, while retaining patient focus.\\" In May 2015, a study conducted by the Open University and University College London found that clinical leaders \\"seemed to be more willing to challenge or ignore diktats and messages from above, and to encourage their managerial colleagues to do the same\\". Clinical leaders were more \\"focused on outcomes and less interested in processes. They don't really mind how they do things as long as they feel they're having an impact\\". Having the option of returning to full-time clinical practice meant that clinicians felt a \\"degree of freedom in what they say and do\\". In April 2018, in a dispute brought by City of Wolverhampton Council against Shropshire and South Worcestershire CCGs over their failure to meet the continuing healthcare costs for a patient with learning disabilities, Mr Justice Garnham ruled that a CCG cannot pay for treatment of a patient registered with a general practitioner outside their area. =Funding= In 2018/19, ¬£74.2 billion was distributed among the 195 CCGs in England, equivalent to ¬£1,254 per registered patient. The funding formula allocates more money to CCGs with elderly populations, in urban areas, or in more deprived areas. The highest allocation per patient was ¬£1,645 for Knowsley and the lowest ¬£1,040 for Oxfordshire. Funding per head increased in real terms by 2% a year between 2013/14 and 2018/19. Commissioning In 2015, the Centre for Health and the Public Interest estimated that in 2013‚Äì14 there were about 53,000 contracts between the NHS in England and the private sector, including contracts for primary care services, of which the 211 CCGs currently hold 15,000 with an annual value of about ¬£9.3bn. They sent Freedom of Information requests to all 211 CCGs, seeking information about how they monitor contracts with private providers and concluded that CCGs failed to manage contracts with private providers effectively. According to Christian Mazzi, head of health at Bain & Company, in September 2015 70% of CCGs had failed to monitor their private sector contracts or enforce quality standards. 12% had not carried out any visits to private providers, and 60% could not say if they had done so. In April 2013, NHS England established 25 commissioning support units to provide a variety of support functions, largely staffed by former employees of the primary care trusts. All CCGs were told that they must procure support services by a tender process by April 2015. The first tender, by South Lincolnshire and South West Lincolnshire CCGs was won by OptumHealth with a value of ¬£3 million a year for three years. By 2017 only 8 were still in existence. =Incentives and referrals= In September 2015 at least 9 CCGs had set up \\"ethically questionable\\" incentive schemes to persuade GPs to reduce referrals for new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E; attendances and emergency admissions with payments per practice of up to ¬£11,000. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, of the British Medical Association, condemned them as \\"a financial contaminant\\" to patient- doctor trust. The General Medical Council guidance, Financial and commercial arrangements and conflicts of interest provides that a doctor should \\"not allow any interests you have to affect the way you prescribe for, treat, refer or commission services for patients\\" but the council accepted that \\"Finance and other incentives can be an effective way of driving improvements in healthcare.\\" =Service restrictions= An April 2015 survey of CCGs by the Health Service Journal found that more than a third were planning to save money by restricting access to services, i.e. health care rationing, particularly on \\"procedures of limited effectiveness\\", podiatry, in vitro fertilisation, and limiting access to procedures based on aspects of a patient's health, for example whether they smoke or are obese, which can affect outcomes. A similar July 2015 survey by the GP magazine Pulse, found that many CCGs were planning to restrict access to routine care in various ways. Another Health Service Journal survey in September 2015 showed that 34 of 188 CCGs who responded to the survey had restricted access to some services. Restrictions were usually introduced by a number of CCGs acting together across an area. Nottinghamshire CCGs had restricted access to surgery for sleep apnoea and hysterectomy for heavy menstrual bleeding, fat grafts, hair depilation, earlobe repair, and chin, cheek or collagen implants. = Response to 2020 pandemic = In view of the coronavirus pandemic, on 23 and 27 March 2020 the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care directed the NHS Commissioning Board to buy services from the private sector, thereby bypassing CCGs. The directive also allows NHS England to exercise functions normally carried out by CCGs, as the Board deems appropriate. The directive had in an initial expiry at the end of 2020, then in August was extended to 31 March 2021. Regulation and judicial review All CCGs had to go through an authorisation process. Between July and December 2012, there were four waves of authorisation . In 2014 NHS England investigated Wirral Clinical Commissioning Group after Birkenhead MP Frank Field raised concerns about it. They found that the chair and chief clinical officer \\"did not demonstrate the necessary close working agreement\\" about what needed to change within the CCG. There were also questions about the relationship senior leaders had with Arrowe Park Hospital. After the report was published Field repeated his calls for the senior officers to stand aside while a new constitution is made for the governance of the group. In October 2014 it was reported that NHS England were considering a special measures regime for CCGs in difficulties, of which there were said to be about a dozen. Under the current assurance framework, CCGs are rated as \\"assured\\", \\"assured with support\\" or \\"not assured\\". Only Barnet CCG has been rated \\"not assured\\". Guidance issued in August 2015 provided that if CCGs which have been in special measures for more than a year NHS England can \\"trigger changes in the management, governance or structure of the CCG's responsibilities, with the potential for other CCGs or relevant bodies to take over aspects of the local commissioner's responsibilities\\". None had then been placed in special measures yet. In November 2015, Shropshire Clinical Commissioning Group was put in special measures after its financial position deteriorated. It expected an in-year deficit of ¬£10.6 million for 2015/6. In September 2017, 23 CCGs were rated inadequate by NHS England for 2016-17, five were given legal directions and two, Lewisham and Greenwich, were ordered to \\"cease to exercise its acute commissioning functions, including the contract with Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust\\" until April 2019. Bristol CCG were subject to a legal challenge from a local pressure group, Protect Our NHS, who claimed that their processes for involving patients and the public in their decisions were inadequate. A judicial review was withdrawn in June 2014 after the CCG agreed to amend its patient and public involvement strategy and other documents.

He was born in Port-Royal in 1709 and married in Grand-Pre, September 30, 1732. After the Treaty of Paris in 1763, he was released from a prison in Halifax and settled in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia.  Early life  Pierre II Surette's father Pierre was born in the diocese of La Rochelle, France and was a sailor and farmer. He married Jeanne Pellerin at Port-Royal (present day town of Annapolis Royal) in February 1709. They remained at Port-Royal and settled in the parish of St.-Laurent on the haute rivi√®re, now the upper Annapolis River. He was a crew member on Englishman William Winnett's sailing vessel. He died at Port-Royal in October 1789, age 70. Jeanne died at Qu√©bec in January 1758 during Le Grand D√©rangement, also at age 70. Their oldest son Pierre II, was born in December 1709 and married Catherine at Grand-Pr√© in September 1732 and lived at Minas before moving to Petitcoudiac.  French and Indian War  During the French and Indian War, on February 26, 1756, with the Expulsion of the Acadians in full force, Pierre led a daring escape from Fort Cumberland, formerly French Fort Beaus√©jour, at Chignecto. Eighty Acadians escaped via a tunnel they had dug with discarded horse bones. These families escaped to the woods and managed to elude the British for two years, but they paid a terrible price in doing so, suffering from starvation. By 1759, they had joined other Acadian refugees at Miramichi, on the Gulf of St. Lawrence shore. There, they suffered almost as much as they had done in the woods north of Chignecto. On November 18, 1759, near Memramcook, Pierre and two other Acadian resistance leaders, Jean and Michel Bourg, surrendered to the British, but, the following spring, Pierre rejoined the resistance movement, at Restigouche on the Baie des Chaleurs. After a British force captured Restigouche in the summer of 1760, Pierre and his family were sent to a prison compound in Nova Scotia, where they were held until the end of the war in 1763.  After the war After their release, Pierre and his family decided to remain in Nova Scotia, at Chezzetcook near Halifax. Around 1770, Surette and his extended family, along with three of his sons-in-law, Joseph Babin, Jean Bourque and Dominique Pothier, moved to Ste. Anne du Ruisseau, Nova Scotia, present-day Pointe-√†- Rocco, northeast of Cap-Sable. These four men are the ancestors of the present-day Acadians of those names in Yarmouth County.

It works closely with the U.S. Department of State and other U.S. government agencies, NGOs, international governments, and the private sector to create programs and partnership. The organization is headquartered in the historic Meridian House and White-Meyer House, both designed by John Russell Pope. Meridian is a member of the Dupont-Kalorama Museums Consortium.  History  In 1960, Dr. Arthur A. Hauck, a member of the American Council on Education and former president of the University of Maine, worked with the Ford Foundation to purchase the Meridian House from Gertrude Laughlin Chanler. The house was to serve as headquarters of a non-profit organization called the Washington International Center. In 1961, four additional organizations joined the Center: The Foreign Student Service Council, the Governmental Affairs Institute, Institute of Contemporary Arts, and the Institute of International Education. The American Council on Education passed the title of the Meridian House to the Meridian House Foundation. In 1969, the Board of Trustees authorized an annual benefit event, the first-ever Meridian Ball. In 1974, the Department of State approved a proposal by Meridian to take over the implementation of the International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) from the Governmental Affairs Institute. In 1977, Meridian expanded its outreach to the Washington community through a series of programs that focused on citizen education in world affairs and international cultural exchange. In 1987, Meridian acquired the White-Meyer House and grounds from the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Foundation. In 1992, Meridian is renamed as Meridian International Center. In 2010, Meridian celebrated its 50th anniversary. Since its founding over 50 years ago, Meridian International Center has overseen thousands of participants in the IVLP program, curated international arts exhibits and held numerous high-level events.  Programs  With over 500 projects per year, Meridian's programs and conferences fall in to four different categories: leadership exchanges, cultural diplomacy, neutral forums and training. = Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative (YLAI) = YLAI 2016 Cohort YLAI is a four-week U.S. fellowship which aims to empower 250 Latin American and Caribbean business and social entrepreneurs to transform their societies and contribute more fully to economic development and prosperity, security, human rights and good governance in the hemisphere. YLAI Fellows will build networks, linkages and lasting partnerships to attract investments and support for their entrepreneurial ventures.Twenty-four Fellows participated in the pilot program in 2016, and since then the YLAI Professional Fellows Program has gone on to host over 500 Fellows from 36 different countries across the region. = International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) = International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) is a United States run professional exchange program the goal of the program is to provide firsthand knowledge about the United States society and culture while also creating professional relationships. Foreign leaders participate in meetings with their counterparts on varying professional interests and supporting the foreign policy goals of the United States. Meridian has been a partner for over 60 years and works with members of Global Ties U.S, administering over 40 percent of all IVLP projects as a result almost 5,000 international visitors have come to the U.S every year. = Pan-Africa Youth Leadership Program (PAYLP) = Pan-Africa Youth Leadership Program (PAYLP) is a developmental exchange program funded by the U. S Department of State‚Äôs Bureau of Educational and Cultural affairs and implemented by the Meridian International Center. PAYLP brings students from across Africa to the United States and pairs them with an adult mentor. This 3-week U.S based training and cultural exchange provides students with knowledge of civic responsibility and rights, respect of culture and the importance of community engagement. This program also includes a series of workshops, and living with American host family. = Meridian Center for Cultural Diplomacy (MCCD) = The Meridian Center for Cultural Diplomacy (MCCD) was created in 2014 to use visual and performing arts to achieve U.S foreign policy objectives. MCCD‚Äôs exhibitions have traveled to over 380 host venues in 44 U.S states and 57 countries. Some of the work done by MCCD includes: working with embassies and ministries of worldwide cultures to tell their stories to Americans; assisting corporations interested in deepening their footprint in other countries; and collaborating with the U.S government to provide content that doubly showcases American heritage and highlights our country‚Äôs investments in cultural diplomacy. = U.S Congress- Republic of Korea National Assembly Exchange Program = Meridian International Center has implemented the U.S. Congress - Republic of Korea National Assembly Exchange program since 1997. The program, initially created by U.S. Representative Ben Gilman and his counterpart in the Republic of Korea National Assembly, David Pong, in 1981 is jointly funded by the U.S Department of State and the Republic of Korea National Assembly through its Committee on Foreign Affairs & National Unification. The program brings together university students and young professionals from Korea and the United States for an opportunity to learn about the legislative process in the two countries. It also provides the participants with an opportunity to experience each other‚Äôs cultures and make lifelong personal contacts. Since Meridian begun implementing the program, nearly 500 participants have learned about the history of U.S.-Korean relations and key aspects of the bilateral relationship. = Washington DC Premier Wedding Reception Venue = The Meridian House and the White-Meyer House, headquarters of Meridian International Center, are both examples of residential jewels of renowned architect John Russell Pope, who designed the Jefferson Memorial, the National Gallery of Art (West Building) and the National Archives. The houses are adjacent to each other and surrounded by beautiful historic gardens, forming a city block of supreme historic and architectural interest. Each house provides a unique, unmatched venue for your next event, whether it be a corporate conference, a wedding, a special event, or a reception.  Events  The Center organizes several large events each year. The most prominent one is the Meridian Ball, which usually takes place in October. = Meridian Ball = Meridian's 46th Ball In 1969, Meridian launched an annual benefit. Now in its 50th year (2018), the Meridian Ball‚Äì with associated dinners at the embassies and residences of foreign ambassadors, and Meridian‚Äôs own White-Meyer House ‚Äì is considered one of the most prestigious social events in Washington, D.C. = Meridian Global Leadership Summit = The Meridian Global Leadership Summit brings together leaders and decision makers in a neutral forum to discuss global issues. The summit convenes both domestic and foreign leaders, academics, policy makers, and members of the media to explore more effective ways to address global economic and social changes occurring worldwide. = Meridian Global Leadership Awards = The Global leadership awards were created to honor those who, via their actions exemplify the effect that positive leadership can have on their own communities and communities around the world.

St. John was imprisoned until the end of December, 1781 when was freed along with the eighteen other survivors in a prisoner exchange. The incident became the basis for St. John‚Äôs poem Descent on Middlesex, a Poetical Relation of the Capture of the Congregation at Middlesex...with an Account of their Sufferings & c. while in captivity.

Background Anton and Joseph Hemmerle established Hemmerle by taking over an established goldsmiths‚Äô company specialising in medals and orders and in 1895 they are appointment 'Purveyor to the Court' by Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria by Royal warrant of appointment to create medals for the Royal Bavarian Court, Bavarian Order of Merit. The Hemmerle boutique at 14 Maximillianstrasse opened in 1904 and remains there today. Today, Christian Hemmerle, Joseph's great-grandson, manages the company along with his wife Yasmin and parents Stefan and Sylveli. Christian and Yasmin Hemmerle, Stefan and Sylveli‚Äôs son and daughter-in-law joined Hemmerle in 2006. Stefan Hemmerle in 1995 designed a ring for the wife of a Munich art collector, in response to her practice of wearing Berlin iron jewellery (which Germans received in exchange for donating their gold and silver jewels toward funding the War of Liberation). He set a diamond in textured iron rather than in gold or platinum. The combination of common metal with a precious stone was unusual. Hemmerle, is the exclusive maker of the Bavarian Order of Merit since it was instituted in 1957 as well as exclusively responsible for the making of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art since 1905. Design Hemmerle jewellers use gemstones including orange-pink sapphires, green diamonds or conch pearls. often set in unorthodox materials such as copper, steel or wood. Each piece is designed as a unique creation. The family use materials including South China Sea Melo pearls or blue aquamarines from Brazil's Santa Maria mines. Hemmerle's styles include the tassel earring, created using a traditional Austrian technique of knitting together cut stones often in bright colours into invisibly stitched strands. Hemmerle's Harmony bangle was included in the permanent collection of the William and Judith Bollinger Jewellery Gallery at London's Victoria and Albert Museum in October 2010. In 2011, the Hemmerles co-wrote a book Delicious Jewels with the chef and author Tamasin Day-Lewis, published by Prestel Publishing. Hemmerle's Harmony bangle, Egyptian Story, 2012, became part of the permanent collection of the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York City in January 2013. In 2014 the company designed a jewellery collection titled Nature's Jewels consisting of twelve brooches, two pairs of earrings, a necklace and a ring, with themes of fruits, seeds, leaves and trees. The company also published a poetry book, Nature‚Äôs Jewels. through the art-book publisher Mack with poems by Greta Bellamacina. In 2016 Hemmerle announced The [AL] Project, a series of jewels exploring the properties of aluminium, previewed at TEFAF in Maastricht. In the same year, Hemmerle participated in Beauty‚ÄîCooper Hewitt Design Triennial at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York. This is the fifth instalment of the Triennial exhibition series. In 2018 Hemmerle celebrated its 125th Anniverary with two projects. The first was Hidden Treasures with creations inspired by its past as a medal-maker and the second was the Revived Treasures project with a body of work that paid homage to Egyptian civilisation. The project included twenty four one-of-a-kind creations, sixteen of which incorporated ancient Egyptian artefacts that were treasure-hunted and collected over the past decade, one creation incorporated a 19th century artefact and seven creations were inspired by Egyptian motifs and culture. In 2019 a Bishop‚Äôs Pectoral Cross created by Hemmerle in 1900 joined the permanent collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The cross was designed by Hemmerle‚Äôs founders - brothers Joseph and Anton Hemmerle - for the Exposition Universelle of 1900 in Paris, where it was awarded one of the show‚Äôs prizes.  Museum exhibitions  Hemmerle jewels have been part of numerous exhibitions worldwide including Canada, the United States, Japan, Australia, France and the UAE, amongst others.

It was released worldwide in June 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game's plot focuses on Nilin, a memory hunter working for an underground resistance called the Errorists. When the game starts, she has been stripped of nearly all her memories by megacorporation Memorize. With the help of a mysterious man named Edge, she goes on a quest to bring down Memorize and recover her lost memories. Throughout the story, she is permitted to use her Memory Remix power to ultimately refurbish people's recollections. The combat consists of a modified combo system called Pressen. Remember Me was developed as the debut project of Dontnod Entertainment, with one of the company's founding members Jean-Maxime Moris as its director. Part of his goal for the game was to create a thought-provoking narrative, and eventually settled on a female protagonist to help convey the story's themes. Originally a PlayStation 3-exclusive under Sony titled Adrift, it was cancelled in 2011 and later purchased by Capcom which resurrected it as a multi-platform game. Remember Me was praised for its world design, Olivier Deriviere's soundtrack, the ambition of the story and the Memory Remix segments, while the main criticisms laid against other aspects of the story, poor design choices and formulaic combat.  Gameplay  Nilin engages in combat, using the Spammer against her enemies Remember Me features platforming, exploration and melee combat. The game is played as Nilin from a third-person view and introduces the mechanic of memory remixing: entering and rearranging a target's memories to manipulate them. Players accomplish this by replaying a memory and modifying details to change the target's recollection of the outcome. Another key mechanic of the gameplay is stealing memories from certain targets and using points called Remembranes to replay the memory in real-time: this is often needed to proceed through the game or avoid hazards otherwise hidden from the player. When the player is low on health, the screen will glitch until a sufficient amount of health is regained. On occasion, Nilin encounters puzzles in the form of riddles she must solve to unlock doors so as to further progress in the story. In terms of combat, the game allows players to create and customise their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four categories of fighting moves called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time. The Pressen moves are Regen (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous moves) and Cooldown (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen moves will be made available to the player over the course of the game: the moves enable them to do things like stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct. Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer and Junk Bolt.  Synopsis  = Setting = The game is set in the year 2084, in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris, where the Memorize corporation has invented a new brain implant called Sensen, which enables 99% of the population to upload and share their memories on the net, as well as remove unhappy or unpleasant memories. This establishes Memorize as a surveillance state, which leads a small group of rebels by the name of Errorists to attempt to bring down the corporation. The invention of the Sensen has also resulted in the creation of Leapers, memory-addicted humans who have absorbed so many memories that their Sensen has degraded and they have mutated into subhuman form, now living in the sewers of Neo-Paris. = Plot = The game begins as Nilin (Kezia Burrows), an Errorist imprisoned in the Bastille Fortress, is having almost all her memory wiped by Memorize. As she is taken to have the last of her memories wiped, a mysterious man called Edge, the leader of the Errorists and a man she only hears over her comm device, helps her escape. Edge tells her that she is an Errorist with the gift of both stealing and remixing memories. After escaping into the slums of Neo- Paris, Nilin encounters Tommy, a fellow Errorist. Nilin and Tommy are attacked by Olga Sedova, a bounty hunter chasing Nilin. Nilin dives into Olga's mind and remixes her memory to make Olga believe that her husband was killed by a Memorize doctor. She then becomes an Errorist ally, and transports Nilin to her first destination. Arriving in the Saint-Michel district, Nilin, who is aided by another Errorist codenamed Bad Request, is told by Edge to steal secret codes from Kaori Sheridan, Neo-Paris' top architect. After retrieving and uploading the codes to Edge, he uses them to open the Saint-Michel dam, flooding the district. Due to the flood draining out the slums, Nilin is able to infiltrate the Bastille and heads to the memory servers to free the stored memories of herself and the inmates while taking down Madame, the sadistic manager of the Bastille. With Madame defeated, Nilin releases the memories of the inmates and partially regains some of her own. She remembers the crime that landed her in the Bastille; on a mission, Nilin remixed the mind of a Memorize commander and made him believe he had killed his girlfriend. The altered memory pushed him to commit suicide. Nilin reluctantly goes along with Edge's next plan: to remix the CEO of Memorize, Scylla Cartier-Wells, to make her see the harm her company's technology is causing. Nilin makes her way into Scylla's office and enters her mind, remixing the memory of a car crash which left her with a bitter taste against the world. As she changes the memory to make Scylla a more compassionate person, Nilin discovers that she is Scylla's daughter. Nilin is then told by Edge to head for the Bastille basements to save Bad Request, who has been taken captive. She finds Bad Request, but discovers that his memory has been fully wiped. It is revealed that Memorize scientist Doctor Quaid means to control the Leapers through their Sensens and thus breed a private army for Memorize. However, Johnny Greenteeth, a former co-worker of Quaid's who was experimented on and turned into a Leaper, kills Quaid and prepares to self-destruct the Bastille. Bad Request helps Nilin take down Johnny at the cost of his life and Nilin escapes the destroyed facility. With all of Memorize's secret operations taken down, Edge presses Nilin to find the Conception Cube, Memorize's central base, and destroy H3O, the Memorize Central Server. Once there, she encounters her father, Charles Cartier-Wells, the creator of the Sensens. Upon finding him, she sees that, fuelled by the car accident that injured his wife, he has become lost in a dream of an ideal world free from painful memories, all inspired by the desire to help Nilin forget about the accident. Nilin makes him see the harm his technology causes, and Scylla arrives to convince Charles to help Nilin enter the Central Server. Once in the presence of the Central Server, it is revealed to Nilin that Edge is a self-aware entity created by the amalgamation of unwanted memories within H3O. Nilin, who unwittingly started Edge with the memories of her unhappy childhood, enters the Server and, at H3O/Edge's will, she destroys him and releases the memories back into the general population. As the memories are released, Nilin remembers Edge's words about the mind being a fortress, and says that Edge died to remind people that memories should not become open to all, and that painful memories should be lived with rather than forcibly removed. She comes to the conclusion that outside her now-restored mind she has a family again and a damaged world to heal.  Development  Development of the game began in 2008 when Dontnod Entertainment was formed. Initially called Adrift, the original concept of the game was a world flooded from global warming, with a key gameplay mechanic being the player character using jetskis to navigate a coastal city. Later, the team became interested in the concept of memory as a central theme and redesigned the game accordingly, although game director Jean-Maxime Moris was reluctant to set the game in Paris since the studio was based there. It was originally developed as a role-playing game with Sony publishing it exclusively for the PlayStation 3, starting full development in February 2010. Following creative disagreements between Dontnod and Sony, and the subsequent cancellation of the project in February 2011 because of budget cuts, the project was presented at the 2011 Gamescom trade fair in the hope that it would garner the attention necessary to secure another publishing deal. Capcom purchased the intellectual property in 2012 and provided funding for the project, reimagining it as an action-adventure game for release on multiple platforms. The game's theme was inspired by the social network sites that abound in the modern world, with Facebook, Tumblr and Twitter cited as examples. Moris explained that while some elements looked fantastical, the game was grounded in the real world in terms of how social networking might evolve over the coming decades. Remember Me was considered to be the digital view of human identity compared to Dontnod's Life Is Strange, its analogue counterpart. The game was influenced by classic cyberpunk anime such as Akira and Ghost in the Shell, and one of the literary works referenced in the game is George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. When asked in an interview why he made the protagonist a woman, Moris replied that he wanted a game in the cyberpunk genre that was more about \\"emotion, intimacy, identity, and the way technology would intersect those\\", so it made more sense for the player character to be a woman. However, when the game was shown to potential publishers, many were discouraged from backing the project, saying that a male character would be more successful. The music was composed by Olivier Deriviere, who recorded the score with a 70-piece orchestra, then modified and changed it using electronic equipment. In an interview with Game Informer, Deriviere said: \\"During my first contact [with the game], I was quite confused by so much information and I felt the music should reflect this confusion\\". Deriviere disclosed that players would not hear the main theme until the end of the game, given that it is scattered in pieces through the rest of the score to reflect the nature of the game and the story of Nilin. For his work, Deriviere was awarded the 2013 IFMCA award for Best Original Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media. Remember Me was created with Unreal Engine 3 to lessen the workload involved in making a new intellectual property with a nascent studio of just under 100 employees. To evaluate the engine, Dontnod collaborated with Epic Games' engineering team at various stages during production.  Reception  Remember Me received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to Metacritic. In 2017, The Daily Telegraph named Remember Me one of the best cyberpunk video games. The world design, soundtrack and plot were praised, while aspects of the story, design choices and combat were criticised. Edge staff lauded Nilin as \\"a powerhouse of a protagonist\\" for possessing a blend of character traits that made her instantly likeable, and the story of reclaiming her lost memories was praised as well. The puzzles were said to be fresh and thought provoking. Eurogamers Tom Bramwell appreciated Dontnod's work on the \\"refreshing\\" combat system. He felt the Memory Remix sequences were absorbing and said the portrayal of technology being abused was handled well. According to Ben Reeves of Game Informer, Remember Mes Memory Remixes constituted the highlight of the game, and the soundtrack was also subject to enjoyment. Kevin VanOrd at GameSpot was satisfied with the main character, calling her \\"a great heroine who is both powerful and vulnerable\\". The premise and general setting were commended, with the musical soundtrack appraised as \\"superb\\". Ryan Taljonick at GamesRadar wrote favourably of the city setting and noted that it was rich in detail. Taljonick agreed that the Memory Remix held the most excitement of all the features in the game. Justin Speer of GameTrailers thought Remember Me presented its concept with \\"fascinating\\" and \\"ridiculous\\" elements, while the manipulation of minds with the Memory Remix was described as rewarding. IGN's Daniel Krupa admired the ambition of the game. Neo-Paris was considered vibrant and distinctive, and as with the rest of reviewers, he praised the ability to remix memories. Ludwig Kietzmann at Joystiq approved of Nilin's power to manipulate memories, wishing that there were more opportunities to use it. Staff writing for OPM (UK) opined that the futuristic setting was \\"astonishing\\" and \\"visually arresting\\". Arthur Gies of Polygon endorsed the game world, story and protagonist as its most positive aspects. He argued that the combo modification system set apart an otherwise predictable combat system. Gies felt the soundtrack deserved recognition for its well-written and unique style, which he thought complemented the central theme. Conversely, Edge staff complained that characters other than Nilin were weaker overall. The design of the Pressens combos was thought to be flawed, as the rate at which one unlocks them was too slow to use them until the final hours of the game. Though Bramwell found engagement in the first few hours, he said that the later parts of the story suffered from too many science fiction elements. The absence of external motivation for the main character was also disparaged. Reeves was dissatisfied with the characters, whose world he said was more interesting than they were, and the story was berated for being \\"uninspired\\". VanOrd observed that the game was held back by an unfulfilling story and sub- par level design. The dialogue and metaphors were criticised for dimming the story's potential. Taljonick also disliked the dialogue, with overwhelming jargon noted as one of its chief offences. The exploration was deemed restrictive, the level design claustrophobic, and the combat system \\"stiff\\". Krupa was unimpressed with the action, which he felt lacked variation and was not well executed. His delight in the setting led to disappointment with the limited exploration of it. The lack of Memory Remixes received reproval as well. Kietzmann declared Remember Me as \\"a listless and mediocre action game\\" whose appearance held more value than its performance, and objected to the combat for being \\"stilted\\" and void of excitement. PlayStation Official Magazine ‚Äì UK staff became quickly disenchanted with the game as it delved into \\"generic fighting\\". =Sales= The game became a Capcom \\"Platinum Title\\", with more than 1 million copies sold. Its inclusion on PlayStation Plus accumulated more than two million players, causing it to become the second most downloaded PlayStation Plus title in Europe.  Other media  Prior to the game's release, an official prelude story was published by way of a multimedia web site. The interactive site was depicted as the diary of Antoine Cartier-Wells, founder of the Memorize corporation and creator of the Sensen brain implant, and it tells the story of Memorize during the 100 years preceding the start of the game. At the time of the game's release, a 24-page print comic book written by Matt Kindt and illustrated by Matthew Southworth was released by Dark Horse Comics, as an exclusive bonus item for those who pre-ordered the game from GameStop. Dark Horse later published a 184-page hardcover book featuring concept art and developer commentary. On 20 June 2013, another official prelude story was published, this time set months before the start of the game, and centring on the character of Nilin. Titled The Pandora Archive, it was written by British novelist Scott Harrison and published by Capcom as an e-book.  Sequel  By 2015, Dontnod had already completed the story for a possible sequel. Creative director Jean-Maxime Moris said \\"We know what we would do for Remember Me 2. The main story has been written we know what we would add to the recipe. We know what we would fix. It's a game that's ready to be made, but that decision is Capcom's to make\\". However, Moris added that Dontnod intended to work on another season of Life Is Strange before proceeding with the sequel to Remember Me. A sequel is reportedly no longer viable with Capcom; CEO Oskar Guilbert admitted that while \\"[Remember Me] did OK\\", only Life Is Stranges unexpected success saved the company from \\"a very difficult\\" financial situation.

It contains 15 private homes as well as a 17th-century English country house which now operates as The Oakes Holiday Centre, a Christian, residential activity centre for young people between the ages of 8 and 18. It is set in extensive grounds which make it very difficult to be seen by the general public. It is situated on Norton Lane in the suburb of Norton within the City of Sheffield in England. The house is a Grade II* listed building, as are several other buildings and features. The park also contains Norton Oakes Cricket Club at the Corner of Norton Lane and Norton Avenue. History The first building on the site was mentioned in deeds of 1590 when John Parker was the owner. The Parkers were followed by Robert Boulton who purchased the houses for ¬£355 and then Henry Wigfall of Eckington who paid ¬£450 in 1624. The present house was built around the year 1668 by John Lee of nearby Hazelbarrow Hall for his bride Barbara, he purchased the \\"newly built messuage\\" for ¬£1,600.\\"The Old And Historical Buildings Of Sheffield\\", J. Edward Vickers, (No Publisher), (No ISBN), Page 39, Gives details of early history and Isherwood Bagshawe. Unfortunately Barbara died the same year and the house was sold to Francis Barker of Lees Hall at Norton Lees in 1672. Barker lived at the house with his wife Ann for only a short time and the house changed owners several times in a short period. In 1681 John Morewood sold the house to his wife‚Äôs brother Henry Gill for ¬£1,240, whose eldest daughter Elizabeth married Richard Bagshawe in 1699. Rotherham Web. Gives early history. =The Bagshawe family= The Bagshawe family would remain as owners of Oakes Park for the next 288 years (until 1987). Three sons of Richard Bagshawe and Elizabeth Gill (Richard, William and John) held the Oakes estates in succession until the failure to produce an heir meant it was inherited in 1801 by a distant cousin of the family William Chambers Darling, a Hull doctor. Darling changed his name to Bagshawe, was knighted in 1806 and undertook a substantial redesign of the house using the Lancaster architect Joseph Badger, whose changes included a complete re- fronting of the house. He also embarked on large-scale modifications to the parkland around the house using Napoleonic War prisoners to dig out a lake, construct a walled garden and enclose over 100 acres. The terrace in front of the house was designed by Francis Chantrey while the garden is thought to have been planned by John Nash.

The tenth owner of The Oakes was the rather eccentric Mrs. Isherwood Bagshawe who did not believe in progressive development and had no modern amenities in the house, she closed all the rooms and covered the art treasures with sacking and old newspaper. In 1963 Major Thornber Bagshawe inherited the house and found that it had no telephone or electric lighting installed, he and his wife Hilary spent a substantial sum of money renovating the house and then opening it up to the general public for viewing. The downfall of Oakes Park as a stately home began in the early 1980s with the construction of the A6102 (Bochum Parkway) as part of the Sheffield Outer Ring Road which cut the estate into two, demolishing many old buildings and two cruck barns.\\"Listed Buildings In Sheffield\\", Barbara A.

He is also known as Chou Chih or Zhou Zhi in Mandarin. Chow Chih was a military strategist who led 100 battles in Canton (now Guangdong) and was introduced by Chiang Kai-shek at a 1942 anti-Japan planning conference as a soldier with great achievements in all the military arts. Early life Chow was born on 14 February 1890, in Stone River Village, Cuanshi Township in Kaiping county to his 17-year-old father Chow Tin Yuet and 19-year-old mother Chow Fang. Chow's father Tin Yuet was an early Chinese settler in Mississippi and was part of the Mississippi Delta Chinese. Tin Yuet regularly sent money home to his family and visited Canton. Chow's sister Run Ho was born a few years later and his brother Zhang Li was born in 1909. Tin Yuet owned and operated a grocery store in rural Hollandale, Mississippi. Chow's first marriage at the age of 16 was to 18-year-old Ao Yin- Chiao (born 6 March 1888) from Canton and was arranged by his father Tin Yuet. A son named Chow Tso-Hsu was born on 16 April 1914 and was the only child born from Chow's first marriage. Military career Chow graduated from the first class of Whampoa Military Academy in Canton, the first class of Baoding Officers School and then graduated in the third class of Army University in Peking (Beijing). North China warlord Chang Tso-lin (Zhang Zuolin), nicknamed the \\"Tiger of Manchuria,\\" tried to recruit Chow to join Chang's warlord army but Chow headed from Army University in Peking with his classmate Deng Yanda to join Sun Yat-sen's People's Revolutionary Army. Chow became a commander of a regiment for the People's Revolutionary Army and was then promoted to commander in chief, commander of the infantry, Office Director of the Ministry of Defense and played other significant roles for the Nationalist Party. He later returned to Whampoa as an instructor as the Lieutenant General in charge of the officers' research group and helped develop military talent including the head of the New First Army, Sun Liren and the Kuomintang commander-in- chief Liu Angi, according to Zhou Zhouhe and Zhou Songyao, two of Chow's former soldiers who wrote a short biography in Chinese entitled \\"General Zhou Zhi, Leader in the War of Resistance Against Japan.\\" Chiang noted that Chow had been in the first class of the Whampoa (now Huangpo) Military Academy, the first class of the Baoding Officers School and the third class of the Infantry University. Chow was then serving as the 12th group Nationalist Army general staff officer. \\"He (Chow) has brilliance in all things military and deserves respect as the supreme commander of the military world,\\" Chiang told a joint meeting of key leaders of the Nationalists and Communists assembled in Nanye Heng Mountain. The meeting was also attended by Ho Ying-chin (He Yingquin in Mandarin) who was then chief of staff for the Nationalist Army and subsequently briefly served as prime minister of China, and Communist leaders Mao Tse-tung and Chow Enlai(Zhou Enlai in Mandarin). (source: A biography in Chinese on Chow Chih called \\"General Zhou Zhi, Leader in the War of Resistance Against Japan\\" by Zhou Zuozhe and Zhou Songyao, published in Hong Kong, date after 1985 unknown.) During the Northern Expedition of 1926‚Äì28 led by Chiang Kai-shek, Chow commanded troops along with General Xue Yue. Xue's troops found themselves surrounded by warlord troops and sent a message to Chow for a rescue. Chow managed to save Xue and his troops. Xue, a fellow Whampoa graduate. Xue's military skills against the Japanese later earned him the nickname \\"the Patton of Asia\\" by U.S. General Claire Chennault. Chow's second marriage to Guo Wanrong from Nanking in 1930 produced no children. On 1 May 1930, Chow's mother Chow Fang died at the age of 60. Condolences were written to Chow from many military and Nationalist government luminaries including Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Yat-sen's son Sun Fo, Nationalist General Chang Hsueh- liang (Zhang Xueliang who was nicknamed Young Marshal and was a former warlord of Manchuria and Soong Tse-ven, a prominent businessman whose three brothers- in-law were Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek and financier H.H. Kung. General Chow married a third time in 1933 at the age of 43 to 16-year-old Guo Yi Choy who was the younger sister of Chow's second wife. In the early stages of the war against Japan, Chow was based in Canton as Lieutenant General and chief of the general staff of the 12th army group in the seventh military region. From 1938 to 1939, Chow was the section head in charge of military service in Canton. Chow was the head of the general staff of the seventh military region, lieutenant general and head of the general staff of the 12th military group from 1940 to 1944. On 8 December 1941, the Japanese army attacked Hong Kong, then under British control. While the British Army fought back, it was overwhelmed by a coordinated Japanese assault on air, sea and land. The British government sent a telegram requesting help. The 12th group army, commanded by Chow and stationed in Shaoguan, was ordered to break the Japanese siege of Hong Kong. Chow set up a battle plan for Hong Kong and to protect his Canton base. Chow's fellow Nationalist general Yu Hanmou was named the commander to troops on a day and night march to Kowloon. They sent a telegram to the Hong Kong government that if the British troops could hold out until the end of December, the 12th group army would arrive to help fight the enemy, Chow's biographers wrote. On Christmas Day 1941, as the Chinese relief troops were near position, they received the surprise news that British troops in Hong Kong had surrendered. Senior Chinese officials sent a telegram ordering the advance to stop and for the relief troops to return to their original bases. \\"Chow always felt regret at the suffering of his Hong Kong compatriots because of an order that arrived late and a surrender that took place too early,\\" according to the Chinese biography on Chow. Later life Chow retired from the military in 1946, three years before the Communist takeover of China and became a store owner in Nanking (Nanjing). He became an adviser to the government in Canton (Guangdong) for several months in 1949 before returning to his hometown of Kaiping with his third wife Guo Yi Choy and their three young children. Near the end of 1952, the Kaiping People's Court declared Chow a counter-revolutionary. After being held in a Kaiping bell tower for several weeks, Chow was killed by gunshot on 8 March 1953. Chow's first son Tso-Hsu, who had served as a federal judge for Canton province before escaping to Hong Kong in 1951, appealed his father's conviction in 1982. The Kaiping County People's Court exonerated Chow Chih of all charges three years later. On 23 December 1985, the Yangcheng Evening News in China reported on Chow's exoneration.

SECaaS is inspired by the \\"software as a service\\" model as applied to information security type services and does not require on-premises hardware, avoiding substantial capital outlays . These security services often include authentication, anti-virus, anti-malware/spyware, intrusion detection, Penetration testing and security event management, among others. Outsourced security licensing and delivery is boasting a multibillion-dollar market. SECaaS provides users with Internet security services providing protection from online threats and attacks such as DDoS that are constantly searching for access points to compromise websites. As the demand and use of cloud computing skyrockets, users are more vulnerable to attacks due to accessing the Internet from new access points. SECaaS serves as a buffer against the most persistent online threats. Categories of SECaaS The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is an organization that is dedicated to defining and raising awareness of secure cloud computing. In doing so, the CSA has defined the following categories of SECaaS tools and created a series of technical and implementation guidance documents to help businesses implement and understand SECaaS. These categories include: * Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR or BC/DR) * Continuous monitoring * Data loss prevention (DLP) * Email security * Encryption * Identity and access management (IAM) * Intrusion management * Network security * Security assessment * Security information and event management (SIEM) * Vulnerability scanning * Web security SECaaS models SECaaS are typically offered in several forms: * Subscription * Payment for utilized services * Freeware, Some features free for additions have to pay: Examples include AWS, nmap.online, IBM Cloud * Free of charge: Examples include Cloudbric, CloudFlare, and Incapsula. Benefits Security as a service offers a number of benefits, including: *Cost-cutting: SECaaS eases the financial constraints and burdens for online businesses, integrating security services without on-premises hardware or a huge budget. Using a cloud-based security product also bypasses the need for costly security experts and analysts. *Consistent and uniform protection:SECaaS services provide continued protection as databases are constantly being updated to provide up-to-date security coverage. It also alleviates the issue of having separate infrastructures, instead combining all elements in one manageable system. * Constant virus definition updates that are not reliant on user compliance * Greater security expertise than is typically available within an organization * Faster user provisioning * Outsourcing of administrative tasks, such as log management, to save time and money and allow an organization to devote more time to its core competencies * A web interface that allows in- house administration of some tasks as well as a view of the security environment and ongoing activities Challenges SECaaS has a number of deficiencies that make it insecure for many applications. Each individual security service request adds at least one across-the-'Net round-trip (not counting installer packages), four opportunities for the hacker to intercept the conversation: #At the send connection point going up #At the receive connection point going up #At the sending point for the return; and #At the receiving point for the return. SECaaS makes all security handling uniform so that once there is a security breach for one request, security is broken for all requests, the very broadest attack surface there can be. It also multiplies the rewards incentive to a hacker because the value of what can be gained for the effort is dramatically increased. Both these factors are especially tailored to the resources of the nation/state-sponsored hacker. The biggest challenge for the SECaaS market is maintaining a reputation of reliability and superiority to standard non-cloud services. SECaaS as a whole has seemingly become a mainstay in the cloud market. Cloud-based website security doesn‚Äôt cater to all businesses, and specific requirements must be properly assessed by individual needs. Business who cater to the end consumers cannot afford to keep their data loose and vulnerable to hacker attacks. The heaviest part in SECaaS is educating the businesses. Since data is the biggest asset for the businesses, it is up to CIOs and CTOs to take care of the overall security in the company.

In 2012, an implementation of CoDel was written by Dave T√§ht and Eric Dumazet for the Linux kernel and dual licensed under the GNU General Public License and the 3-clause BSD license. Dumazet's variant of CoDel is called fq_codel, standing for \\"fair queuing controlled delay\\"; it was adopted as the standard active queue management (AQM) and packet scheduling solution in the OpenWrt release called \\"Barrier Breaker\\". From there, CoDel and fq_codel have migrated into various downstream projects such as Tomato, dd-wrt, OPNsense and Ubiquiti's \\"Smart Queues\\" feature. Theoretical underpinnings The theory behind CoDel is based on observations of packet behavior in packet-switched networks under the influence of data buffers. Some of these observations are about the fundamental nature of queueing and the causes of bufferbloat, others relate to weaknesses of alternative queue management algorithms. CoDel was developed as an attempt to address the problem of bufferbloat. =Bufferbloat= The flow of packets slows down while travelling through a network link between a fast and a slow network, especially at the start of a TCP session, when there is a sudden burst of packets and the slower network may not be able to accept the burst quickly enough. Buffers exist to ease this problem by giving the fast network a place to store packets to be read by the slower network at its own pace. In other words, buffers act like shock absorbers to convert bursty arrivals into smooth, steady departures. However, a buffer has limited capacity. The ideal buffer is sized so it can handle a sudden burst of communication and match the speed of that burst to the speed of the slower network. Ideally, the shock absorbing situation is characterized by a temporary delay for packets in the buffer during the transmission burst, after which the delay rapidly disappears and the network reaches a balance in offering and handling packets. The TCP congestion control algorithm relies on packet drops to determine the available bandwidth between two communicating devices. It speeds up the data transfer until packets start to drop, and then slows down the transmission rate. Ideally it keeps speeding up and slowing down as it finds an equilibrium at the speed of the link. For this to work, the packet drops must occur in a timely manner so that the algorithm can responsively select a suitable transfer speed. With packets held in an overly- large buffer, the packets will arrive at their destination but with a higher latency but no packets are dropped so TCP does not slow down. Under these conditions, TCP may even decide that the path of the connection has changed and repeat the search for a new equilibrium. Having a big and constantly full buffer which causes increased transmission delays and reduced interactivity, especially when looking at two or more simultaneous transmissions over the same channel, is called bufferbloat. Available channel bandwidth can also end up being unused, as some fast destinations may not be reached due to buffers being clogged with data awaiting delivery to slow destinations. =Good and bad queues= CoDel distinguishes between two types of queue: ; Good queue : Defined as a queue that exhibits no bufferbloat. Communication bursts cause no more than a temporary increase in queue delay. The network link utilization is maximized. ; Bad queue : Defined as a queue that exhibits bufferbloat. Communication bursts cause the buffer to fill up and stay filled, resulting in low utilization and a constantly high buffer delay. In order to be effective against bufferbloat, a solution in the form of an active queue management (AQM) algorithm must be able to recognize an occurrence of bufferbloat and react by deploying effective countermeasures. Van Jacobson asserted in 2006 that existing algorithms have been using incorrect means of recognizing bufferbloat. Algorithms like RED measure the average queue length and consider it a case of bufferbloat if the average grows too large. Jacobson demonstrated in 2006 that this measurement is not a good metric, as the average queue length rises sharply in the case of a communications burst. The queue can then dissipate quickly (good queue) or become a standing queue (bad queue). Other factors in network traffic can also cause false positives or negatives, causing countermeasures to be deployed unnecessarily. Jacobson suggested that average queue length actually contains no information at all about packet demand or network load. He suggested that a better metric might be the minimum queue length during a sliding time window. Algorithm Based on Jacobson's notion from 2006, CoDel was developed to manage queues under control of the minimum delay experienced by packets in the running buffer window. The goal is to keep this minimum delay below 5 milliseconds. If the minimum delay rises to too high a value, packets are dropped from the queue until the delay drops below the maximum level. Nichols and Jacobson cite several advantages to using nothing more than this metric: * CoDel is parameterless. One of the weaknesses in the RED algorithm (according to Jacobson) is that it is too difficult to configure, especially in an environment with dynamic link rates. * CoDel treats good queue and bad queue differently. A good queue has low delays by nature, so the management algorithm can ignore it, while a bad queue is subject to management intervention in the form of dropping packets. * CoDel works off of a parameter that is determined completely locally; It is independent of round-trip delays, link rates, traffic loads and other factors that cannot be controlled or predicted by the local buffer. * The local minimum delay can only be determined when a packet leaves the buffer, so no extra delay is needed to run the queue to collect statistics to manage the queue. * CoDel adapts to dynamically changing link rates with no negative impact on utilization. * The CoDel implementation is relatively simple and therefore can span the spectrum from low-end home routers to high-end routing solutions. CoDel does nothing to manage the buffer if the minimum delay for the buffer window is below the maximum allowed value. It also does nothing if the buffer is relatively empty (if there are fewer than one MTU's worth of bytes in the buffer). If these conditions do not hold, then CoDel drops packets probabilistically. =Description= The algorithm is independently computed at each network hop. The algorithm operates over an interval, initially 100 milliseconds. Per-packet queuing delay is monitored through the hop. As each packet is dequeued for forwarding, the queuing delay (amount of time the packet spent waiting in the queue) is calculated. The lowest queuing delay for the interval is stored. When the last packet of the interval is dequeued, if the lowest queuing delay for the interval is greater than 5 milliseconds, this single packet is dropped and the interval used for the next group of packets is shortened. If the lowest queuing delay for the interval is less than 5 milliseconds, the packet is forwarded and the interval is reset to 100 milliseconds. When the interval is shortened, it is done so in accordance with the inverse square root of the number of successive intervals in which packets were dropped due to excessive queuing delay. The sequence of intervals is 100, {100 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{2}}, {100 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{3}}, {100 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{4}}, {100 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{5}} ... =Simulation results= CoDel has been tested in simulation tests by Nichols and Jacobson, at different MTUs and link rates and other variations of conditions. In general, results indicate: * In comparison to RED, CoDel keeps the packet delay closer to the target value across the full range of bandwidths (from 3 to 100 Mbit/s). The measured link utilizations are consistently near 100% of link bandwidth. * At lower MTU, packet delays are lower than at higher MTU. Higher MTU results in good link utilization, lower MTU results in good link utilizations at lower bandwidth, degrading to fair utilization at high bandwidth. Simulation was also performed by Greg White and Joey Padden at CableLabs. =Implementation= A full implementation of CoDel was realized in May 2012 and made available as open- source software. It was implemented within the Linux kernel (starting with the 3.5 mainline). Dave T√§ht back-ported CoDel to Linux kernel 3.3 for project CeroWrt, which concerns itself among other things with bufferbloat, where it was exhaustively tested. CoDel began to appear as an option in some proprietary/turnkey bandwidth management platforms in 2013. FreeBSD had CoDel integrated into the 11.x and 10.x code branches in 2016. An implementation is distributed with OpenBSD since version 6.2.

Early career Hamdani graduated from the Iraqi Military College in Baghdad in 1970 with a BA in military science. He served in the 71st Brigade as a first lieutenant, which saw action on the Golan Heights as part of the 3rd Armoured Division during the Yom Kippur War. Following the war he attended Bakr University from 1978 to 1980 receiving an MA in military science from the Iraqi Staff College. Iran‚ÄìIraq War During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War Hamdani served as a staff officer in various armoured and reconnaissance units, and joining the Republican Guard in 1982, and serving as a senior training office between 1987 and 1989. He received both of Saddam Hussein's sons; Uday and Qusay, as well as Tariq Aziz's son, to serve as officers in his battalion. This was done as a political stunt, so Saddam and Tariq-Aziz could claim their sons were fighting in the war. However, Hamdani was told not to let any of the sons die. Iraq War Hamdani as commander of the II Republican Guard Corps As commander of the II Republican Guard Corps, Hamdani was given responsibility for the Karbala region. Hamdani was further stripped of units after Qusay Hussein believed that the U.S. invasion of the South was a feint. Hamdani protested this and argued that unless reinforcements were rushed to the Karbala gap immediately to prevent a breach, U.S. troops would reach Baghdad within 48 hours. His suggestions fell on deaf ears.Interview with Lt. Gen. Raad al- Hamdani  PBS Frontline Hamdani was ordered to launch a counterattack in response to the continued U.S. advance, resulting in a night raid on the 2‚Äì3 April which was repulsed with heavy casualties. The U.S. counterattack the following morning totally routed the Republican Guard forces. After the war Following the invasion of Iraq the Iraqi Army was dissolved by way of Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2. Hamdani, now no longer in the Iraqi military, was cleared of any political crimes by the Coalition forces. However, due to his status as a former Sunni army officer linked to the former Ba'athist government, Hamdani became a target for Shiite militias. As a result, Hamdani fled the country, alongside some 2 million other Iraqis. Hamdani moved to Amman, where he works in military academia. As of 2008 Hamdani believed that were he to return to Iraq he would likely be killed.https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video?id=4490171 Following the war Hamdani also founded the Association of Former Officers of the Iraqi Armed Forces, for which he is currently the chairman, and has been working to help reinstate former officers of the Iraqi Army into the new Armed Forces. As of 2009, Hamdani was still in contact with the Iraqi Ba'ath Party, representatives of which had expressed to him their approval for his work to reintegrate former members of the Ba'athist regime into the new Iraq. Hamdani also claimed to have direct contacts with Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed al-Muwali, the rival to al- Douri for the party's leadership. Hamdani has claimed however that he only represents former military officials, but that he feels that the government does need to make more concessions to reintegrate former Ba'athists. Mohammed Salman al-Saady, Maliki's adviser for reconciliation, has claimed that talks with Hamdani had stalled due to Hamdani's demands being against government policy. Personal life Hamdani is a Sunni Muslim who was born in Baghdad. He is a secularist, and is noted for his sense of humour and cosmopolitan attitude. He can read English, but cannot speak it fluently. As of 2009 he was living in Amman, Jordan, and was interviewed the same year for the Iraqi Perspectives Project. He built a close relationship with Qusay Hussein, who served in his battalion in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Hamdani believes this relationship likely kept him out of prison during the 1990s and saved him when he gave advice counter to Saddam's views. In 1992 he earned a PhD in military science from the Iraqi War College. Hamdani featured in a historical television program made for RT Arabic, appearing in the episodes detailing the Yom Kippur War,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHnqIkKl3T4 the Gulf War,http://arabic.rt.com/prg/telecast/33432/ and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPCDNkZVDAo He also published his memoirs, entitled Before History Leaves Us, in 2007.

He left his homeland for Hungary in the retinue of Yolanda de Courtenay, queen of Andrew II of Hungary in 1216 or 1217. Bartholomew was bishop of P√©cs between 1219 and 1251, but he spent a significant part of this period on diplomatic missions. He returned to his family estates in 1247 and resigned from the bishopric some year before his death around 1254. Life =Early life= Bartholomew was the third son of Henri le Gros, lord of Brancion and Uxelles in Burgundy by his wife, Beatrix of Vignory. A younger son, Bartholomew was dedicated to ecclesiastical carrier. He escorted Yolande de Courtaney, bride to King Andrew II of Hungary to her new homeland at the turn of 1216 and 1217. King Andrew II appointed Bartholomew bishop of P√©cs in 1219 after the death of Bishop Kal√°n. The canons of the cathedral chapter of P√©cs attempted to prevent Bartholomew's installation by stating that he was too young for this position, but an official inquiry ordered by the Holy See ascertained that the new bishop had already attained 30 years, the age required by canon law. The same inquiry, however, revealed that Bartholomew's education was imperfect, so the pope ordered him to employ a magister until improving his knowledge. Bartholomew fulfilled this requirement in two years. =Bishop of P√©cs= He was appointed eight times between 1223 and 1239 to decide in court cases, which proves that he had by that time made himself master of canon law. Bartholomew himself was involved in a debate over the borders between his diocese and the archdiocese of Kalocsa. He even attempted to acquire the right of patronage over the abbey at Sremska Mitrovica (now in Serbia) by using a falsified charter. Bartholomew established a monastery at the Saint James Hill at P√©cs for the hermits, up to that time scattered in the Mecsek Hills. A short regulation allegedly written by Bishop Bartholomew for the monastery is presented in the 16th-century work on the history of the Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit by Gergely Gy√∂ngy√∂si, but the authenticity of the text is debated. Bartholomew also built a parish church dedicated to Saint James which contributed to the formation of a core territory in P√©cs, a town consisting of smaller independent communities. He accompanied Archbishop Robert of Esztergom to a group of Cumans who had decided to receive baptism to the territories east of the Carpathian Mountains in 1227. He also assisted the military expeditions Duke Coloman of Slavonia launched against the heretics in Bosnia in the 1230s. Bartholomew's evangelical ardour is also reflected by the introduction of the Franciscans and Dominicans in P√©cs in his time. Bartholomew visited the court of Aragon four times between 1229 and 1235 in order to make arrangements for the planned marriage of Princess Yolanda of Hungary (a daughter of King Andrew II by Queen Yolanda) to King James I of Aragon. Moreover, Bartholomew prepared the first draft to the prenuptial agreement in 1233 and performed the ceremony in 1235. In the meantime, he also visited his homeland and made a donation of 12 marks of gold for the Cluny Abbey. Along with other prelates, Bishop Bartholomew personally led his troops against the invading Mongols in the Battle of Mohi in 1241. He only escaped from the battlefield when he saw that the battle had been lost. Although the Mongols were chasing after the bishop, his life was saved by the intervention of Ladislaus from the kindred K√°n, head of Somogy County. Bartholomew fled to Split in Dalmatia where he stayed with King B√©la IV of Hungary and his family who also survived the second phase of the Mongol invasion in the seaside town. Following the withdrawal of the Mongols from Hungary, Bishop Bartholomew was often appointed by the monarch to lead diplomatic missions. First he unsuccessfully attempted to mediate a peace between Split and Trogir in 1244. =Last years= King B√©la IV sent Bartholomew to Lyon in 1247 in order to seek assistance from Pope Innocent IV against a planned new Mongol invasion. Back in his homeland, Bartholomew settled in his family estates and never returned to his see. He even decided to resign his office in 1251. Although the pope promised him a life annuity of 200 marks of silver from the revenues of the diocese of P√©cs, Bartholomew did not receive this income for two years. Therefore he again visited the pope, now in Assisi (Italy). The pope, however, took into account the financial difficulties in Bartholomew's former diocese caused by the Mongol invasion and reduced his income to 100 marks of silver. The last record on the retired bishop is dated to the spring of 1254 when he sold three houses in Paris. See also * Mongol invasion of Europe References * Bouchard, Constance Brittain (1987).

Previously, he was Under Secretary for Food and Health at the Government of Hong Kong.  Early life and education  Leung was born in Hong Kong and studied at Wah Yan College. He continued his education at Stonyhurst College in the United Kingdom (1986-1989) and Crescent School in Canada (1990). When his family moved to Canada due to his father's job with a multinational company, Leung entered the medical school at the University of Western Ontario. Initially majoring in neurosurgery, he eventually switched to public health and completed his family medicine residency training in Toronto. He then received a Master of Public Health degree from Harvard University in 1999., and earned a research doctorate (Doctor of Medicine) at the University of Hong Kong  Career  Leung joined the HKU medical faculty as an assistant professor in the Department of Community Medicine (now part of the School of Public Health) in 1999 and became an associate professor when the School of Public Health was formed in 2004. During the SARS outbreak, he established and directed the Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group. In 2005, he and Catherine Mary Schooling expanded the Children of 1997 study, which followed 'the majority of all babies born in Hong Kong during April and May 1997', into a life-course epidemiological study. Leung was a Takemi Fellow at Harvard University from 2004 to 2005, and was promoted to full professor in 2006 after returning to HKU. He also served as the Vice President and Censor in Public Health Medicine at the Hong Kong College of Community Medicine from 2006 to 2008. In 2008, Leung left academia and joined the Government of Hong Kong as the first Under Secretary for Food and Health, during which he led the government's response in the 2009 swine flu H1N1 pandemic. He held the position until 2011 when he was appointed the Director of the Office of the Hong Kong Chief Executive. He returned to HKU in 2012 as the head of the Department of Community Medicine until 2013, when the department was incorporated into the School of Public Health. He was also the acting director of the School of Public Health during this period. In 2013, Leung was appointed as the 40th Dean of the HKU Faculty of Medicine and Chair Professor of Public Health. At the age of 40, he was the second youngest dean ever appointed at HKU medical faculty. During his tenure as dean, the Faculty of Medicine launched the Springboard Scholarships and Second Chance Scholarship schemes to recruit students from more diverse backgrounds. A number of major changes to the faculty as a whole also took place under Leung's watch, including the amalgamation of Departments of Anatomy, Biochemistry and Physiology into the School of Biomedical Sciences (2015), the founding of the Emergency Medicine Unit (2015), the expansion of the HKU Health System to include Gleneagles Hong Kong Hospital as the fourth and newest teaching hospital (2017), the introduction of enrichment year in the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) curriculum (2018), and the redevelopment of the Sassoon Road Medical Campus (expected to be completed in 2024). Outside HKU, Leung was the founding chair of the Asia Pacific Observatory on Health Systems Policies from 2010 to 2014, an elected council member of the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine from 2012 to 2019, the founding co-director of the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control from 2014 to 2018, and a member of the University Grants Committee from 2014 to 2019. He is currently serving on the Hospital Authority Board since 2013, the Steering Committee on Primary Healthcare Development since 2017, the Strategic Technical Advisory Committee of the Asia Pacific Observatory on Health Systems Policies since 2018, the Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health at the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation since 2020., and the Global Health Risk Framework Commission. He is also an adjunct professor at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and an adjunct professorial researcher at the China National Health Development Research Center. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Leung is one of four experts advising the Chief Executive and the Government of Hong Kong. Academically, Leung was an editor for the Journal of Public Health between 2007 and 2014, the inaugural co-editor of Epidemics, an associate editor of Health Policy. He is currently the founding deputy editor-in-chief of China CDC Weekly and an editor for the British Medical Journal.  Controversies  Leung's move to the government in 2008 was controversial as HKU retained his professorship, and he held Canadian citizenship at the time. All Principal officials of Hong Kong, including the Secretaries for the Bureaux, must be filled by Chinese citizens without the right of abode in foreign countries. Although Under Secretaries for the Bureax were not a principal official, they may serve as Acting Secretaries when the Secretaries were unable to hold office. He eventually renunciated his Canadian nationality. On a press conference about the COVID-19 pandemic on 25 January 2020, Leung and attending government officials did not wear face masks while asking the public to do so. He was criticised for claiming he would be unable to speak when wearing a face mask. He apologised the following day.

J. W. Barber) is an American scholar and expert on archaeology, linguistics, textiles, and folk dance as well as Professor emerita of archaeology and linguistics at Occidental College. Early life Wayland Barber was born in 1940, in Pasadena. She became interested in archaeology at a young age because of her love of interdisciplinary sciences. Her family moved to France during her childhood, where she learned French, beginning her interest in linguistics. She first developed expert sewing and weaving skills under her mother's tutelage. Scholarly work She earned a bachelor's degree from Bryn Mawr College in archaeology in 1963. Her chief mentor was Mabel Lang from whom she learned Linear B and who advised her honors thesis on Linear A. In addition to Lang, she wrote her thesis under Emmett L. Bennett Jr.. Her thesis used computer indices of the Hagia Triada Linear A texts in an attempt to decipher its signs and symbols. The computer indices were made via punched cards, a method which was preceded by the work of Alice E. Kober on Linear B. She earned her PhD from Yale University in linguistics in 1968. Her doctoral study at Yale University was supervised by Sydney Lamb, under whom she wrote her dissertation, \\"The Computer Aided Analysis of Undeciphered Ancient Texts.\\" Books Her books include Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean (1992), Women's Work: The First 20,000 Years; Women, Cloth, and Society in Early Times (1995), The Mummies of √úr√ºmchi (1999), When They Severed Earth from Sky: How the Human Mind Shapes Myth (2004, coauthor with Paul T. Barber) and The Dancing Goddesses: Folklore, Archaeology, and the Origins of European Dance (2013). Among other things, she has proposed that if 19th-century scientists had thought to name prehistorical periods with an eye on women's work and the things they invented, instead of focusing their naming only on men's more durable inventions (Iron Age, Bronze Age, etc.), that they might have acknowledged women's invention of string as what she has named ‚ÄúThe String Revolution.‚Äù Personal life In addition to her academic work, as of 2009 she has directed and choreographed for her own folk and historical dance troupe for 38 years.

Schizogony and sporogony both occur within the eggs. The mature sexual parasites are vermiform and immobile. The males are smaller than the females. The microgametocyte, when it becomes spherical, gives rise to numerous, elongate microgametes. These are similar to those of Aggregata.

History  On March 1, 1950, Seepolizei-Inspektors (‚ÄúMaritime Police Inspector‚Äù) Walter Steffens received an order to rebuild a naval police school on a former World War II naval aviation field (Seefliegerhorst) in Parow. The first recruits arrived on August 1, 1950, which marked the official opening date of the school. Walter Steffens was the first Director of the school and on December 1, 1970, the school was given the traditions name of \\"Walter Steffens\\" to honor him.

Manheru shares its boundaries with the Madhumadhvi, Nangal, Dheraru and Hindol villages. The village has railway stations on the Hissar-Jaipur track broad- gauge line of the North Western Railway. Geography Manheru is situated about southwast of the district capital Bhiwani and has an average elevation of about . Much like the rest of India, the people of Manheru rely on ground water for their basic needs, which falls during the monsoon season. However, the majority of the groundwater is saline. The climate can be classified as tropical steppe, hot semi-arid which is mainly characterized by the extreme dryness of the air except during monsoon months. During the three months of the south west monsoon from last week of June to September, moist oceanic air penetrates the village and causes high humidity, cloudiness and monsoon rainfall. The period from October to December constitutes post monsoon season. The cold weather season prevails from January to the beginning of March and is followed by the hot weather or summer season which prevails up to the last week of June. Geologically, the area is almost plain and is on the tail of the Aravalli range, the oldest fold mountains in India. The plain area is largely covered with alluvial sand with good fertility for crops. Seismically the area falls in zone-3 creating low damage risk from earthquakes. The village is primarily residential and has 10000-12000 residents. History The village has played an active role in politics and in the army, navy and air force of India as well as carved a niche in political history as the birthplace of Banarsi Das Gupta (Ex-Chief Minister of Haryana). He was a renowned freedom Fighter and went to jail many times during the British Raj. Government The Village has many government edifices for the facilities of peoples, like hospital for mankind and for cattle too, banks and water works for smooth water supply. The village has consecrated temples like Devi Mandir, Dudha Dhari Mandir, Shyam Baba Mandir, Baba Baniwala Mandir and The Bala Ji Mandir, this too is popular nearby areas.

He was an innkeeper and confectioner, and in 1634 established the first house of entertainment in the colony, called Cole's Inn and referenced by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his play John Endicott as the Three Mariners.Samuel Drake's Old Boston Taverns, Cupples, Upham & Company, Boston, 1886, p. 20 Born by 1597, Cole and his family arrived in New England with John Winthrop in 1630, and established themselves on the Shawmut Peninsula, which soon became the town of Boston. He and his wife Ann were among the earliest members of the Boston church, having joined in the autumn of 1630. He opened the first tavern in the area on 4 March 1634 in what later became downtown Boston, but in 1645 relocated his business to the future Merchants Row between State Street and Faneuil Hall. Cole's establishment was a center of social and political life in Boston, and Governor Henry Vane had brought the Narragansett Indian sachem Miantonomoh, with his retinue, for a meal there. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow included Cole and his house of entertainment in his play John Endicott set in the early 1660s. As a member of the Boston Church, Cole was caught up in the Antinomian Controversy that shook the young colony between 1636 and 1638. He signed a petition in support of the minister John Wheelwright who was banished from the colony, and after being threatened with losing his weapons, he signed a remission, calling his support of Wheelwright an error. While during the early days of the colony Cole was considered well off, and contributed to various causes, by 1661 he was suffering financial losses and in June of that year was granted 300 acres of land for being a respected and useful member of the community. Cole was married three times, and had at least four children, all with his first wife, Ann. His son, John, married Susanna, the only person to survive the massacre killing her famed mother, Anne Hutchinson, and many of her siblings. Cole wrote his will in December 1666, and died in Boston shortly thereafter, with his will being proved the following February.  Life  Samuel Cole, born by about 1597, arrived in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony with the Winthrop Fleet in 1630, being accompanied by his wife Ann, and likely all four of his known children. Several online accounts say that Cole was from Mersea in Essex, but it was the first husband of his second wife who came from that place, and Anderson finds no evidence supporting this provenance for him. He and his wife joined the Boston church as members #42 and #43, this indicating that they joined in the autumn of 1630. He requested to be made a freeman on 19 October 1630, and took the freeman's oath the following May. The Shawmut Peninsula (now downtown Boston) in 1775 still looked much as it did during Cole's time there, but today much of the bay has been filled and developed. Boston magistrate John Winthrop wrote in his journal under the date 4 March 1634 that \\"Samuel Cole set up the first house for common entertainment,\\" this being the first tavern or inn in the colony. While claims have been made that this was the first tavern in the American colonies, there is evidence that it was predated by about 20 years in Jamestown, Virginia. The establishment is commonly called Cole's Inn, but was called the Three Mariners by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his play, John Endicott. Cole, besides being called an innkeeper, styled himself as a confectioner and \\"comfitmaker\\" in several deeds. In August 1636 he attended a meeting of the town's wealthier inhabitants, and donated 10 shillings towards the maintenance for a master of a free school. Also in 1636, the colony's governor, Henry Vane brought the Narragansett Indian sachem Miantonomoh, with his retinue, to Boston, and they were served a meal there. Drake, wondering how the guests were seated since the natives were not accustomed to chairs, surmised that they all sat on the floor in a circle, with the pot of meat placed in the middle. As with most members of the Boston church, Cole became caught up in the events of the Antinomian Controversy in 1636 and 1637, and signed a petition on behalf of the Reverend John Wheelwright who was later banished from the colony. On 20 November 1637 Cole was disarmed for this participation, and rather than give up his weapons, he, two days later, was the first to sign an acknowledgment that \\"it was ill done, and unwarrantably, as transgressing therein the rule of due honor to authority, and of modesty, and submission in private persons, and therefore I desire my name may be put out of it.\\" On the last day of February 1638, Cole sold the southern part of a new mansion house in Boston where he \\"lately dwelled\\" to Captain Robert Sedgwicke of Charlestown for ¬£200. The other half of the house was \\"assured to\\" Thomas Mariott and others. This same year the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company was founded, and he was one of its charter members. On 20 May 1645 Cole sold his inn to George Halsell, and on the same day bought another property of Valentine Hill where he opened a new inn. The location of this new establishment relative to later landmarks was on the west side of Merchants Row, about midway between State Street and Faneuil Hall. Frank Cole called it \\"a famous old inn [that] entertained many of the illustrious guests of the time,\\" and also noted that Samuel Cole \\"had the usual experience of the publican under the rule of the Puritan\\" and was fined several times for overcharging his customers and had his license taken away for a time. In addition to being the proprietor of an inn, Cole was briefly active in the affairs of the town, and from 1653 to 1657 he served as a Boston selectman, as well as being a sealer of weights and measures in 1654. While during the early days of the colony Cole was considered well off, and contributed to various causes, by 1661 he was suffering financial losses. In June of that year the General Court made a grant to him, stating that \\"considering that Mr. Cole was an ancient adventurer in the public stock and hath been long out of his money, been at great charges and loss in this business, hath approved himself respective and serviceable to the Court, the Court judgeth it meet to grant Mr. Samuel Cole three hundred acres...\\" Cole wrote his will on 21 December 1666, and died shortly thereafter, with the will proven the following February.  In literature  Cole is featured during a scene in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's play entitled John Endicott, about the Bay colony's sometimes fiery governor. The play takes place in the early 1660s, shortly after four Quakers, known as the Boston martyrs, have been executed in Boston. During a conversation at Cole's Inn, Cole discusses his house of entertainment.John Endicott The reference to Lord Leigh concerns the time when Lord Ley, Earl of Marlborough visited Boston, shortly after Henry Vane lost the governorship to John Winthrop in May 1637. Though invited to lodge at Winthrop's house, the young aristocrat preferred to stay at Cole's Inn, saying that it was well governed, and that he could be as private there as elsewhere. This was one of many slights endured by Winthrop during the colony's difficulties from 1636 to 1638.  Family  Cole's first wife, Ann, died shortly after their arrival in New England, by one account, but certainly before October 1647, at which time Cole was married to the widow Margaret Green, a daughter-in-law of Isaac Green of Mersey, Essex, England. Following the death of his second wife, he married in Boston on 16 October 1660 Ann (Mansfield) Keayne, the widow of Robert Keayne. Ann's sister Elizabeth was the wife of Boston minister John Wilson. Cole's children were all with his first wife, and very likely all born in England. Catherine (born roughly 1622) married Edmund Gross and Elizabeth (born roughly 1624) married Edward Weeden, the son of Samuel. The only known son, John (born 1625), married in Boston on 30 December 1651 Susanna Hutchinson, the only child of William and Anne Hutchinson to survive the Indian massacre in New Netherland that killed her mother and many of her siblings. Susanna had been taken captive for several years before being returned to family members in Boston. The Hutchinsons had been very close neighbors of the Coles in Boston before Mrs. Hutchinson was forced to leave the Massachusetts Bay Colony in early 1638 following the events of the Antinomian Controversy. The fourth child of Samuel and Ann Cole was Mary (born roughly 1628) who first married a Mr. \\"Gawdren\\" (a name not known in early New England at this time and possibly a corruption of another name), and married second on 7 January 1652/3 Edmund Jackson. Among Cole's well known descendants, through his son John, are Stephen Arnold Douglas, who lost to Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 presidential election, and Willard Mitt Romney, who lost to incumbent Barack Obama in 2012.

The library's origins date back to 1908, when the people of the Woodstock neighborhood established a reading room at the Woodstock Fire Station, which soon became one of fifteen \\"deposit stations\\" (packing crates that turned into two-shelf bookcases and could hold up to 50 books each). The Woodstock collection began as an assemblage of children's books and was housed within a public school. In 1911, the station was replaced by a \\"sub-branch\\" library offering more books for adults and children, but without the reference works and services available at regular branches. The collection moved into a larger facility in 1914, which became a full branch in 1917, offering additional resources and services. The library occupied a series of temporary locations during the 1920s‚Äì'40s. Construction began on Woodstock's permanent library building in 1959. It was dedicated on June 1 the following year, the fourth community library built by Multnomah County. Until the mid-1990s the library was maintained as-is with only regular maintenance, though capacity strained as public use grew and new technologies demanded additional shelf space. In 1995, the City of Portland's Bureau of Planning released the \\"Adopted Woodstock Neighborhood Plan\\", which included a policy to improve the branch and its services. In 1996, the county adopted a $28 million bond measure to renovate some branches and upgrade technology throughout the system. Given multiple issues with the existing building, including structural problems and non-compliance with building codes, Multnomah County Library determined reconstruction was necessary. The library was demolished in January 1999. The current Woodstock Library building was completed in 2000. It has a \\"lantern-like\\" quality and has received multiple awards for its design. In addition to offering the Multnomah County Library catalog, which contains two million books, periodicals and other materials, the library houses collections in Chinese and Spanish and employs Chinese-speaking staff. Early history In 1906, the Multnomah County Library began distributing books to neighborhoods outside downtown Portland. A reading room was established in the Woodstock neighborhood's fire station building in 1908; later that year it was recognized as a branch of Multnomah County Library. Deposit stations, containing packing crates that turned into two-shelf bookcases holding up to 50 books each, were often set up within fire stations or private homes. Woodstock received its deposit station, a collection of children's books housed within a public school, in 1909, becoming one of fifteen outlying service areas. On May 16, 1911, the Woodstock deposit station was replaced by a sub-branch library, supplying more reading material for adults and children but without the reference works and other library services offered at regular branches. The collection was moved to a larger storefront facility, west of SE 44th on SE Woodstock Boulevard, on September 12, 1914. The library achieved full branch status in 1917, offering a collection and services comparable to other branches. In 1918, the Woodstock branch and several others were threatened with closure after employees received a $10 per month salary increase, but funding sources helped to defray the additional expense. Along with other county libraries, the branch closed between November 1 and November 16 in response to the 1918 flu pandemic. During the 1920s‚Äì'40s the library occupied a series of temporary locations within rented storefronts. Library resources and services were used heavily by unemployed residents during the Great Depression as well as during and after World War II, as people requested information ranging from foreign locales to victory gardens to jobs. In the 1950s, responding to population changes and the rise in automobile use, Multnomah County Library divided the county into six regions, each of which had a single \\"Class A\\" branch offering extended operating hours and full services. Deposit stations and smaller branch libraries were to be eliminated or merged to house larger collections. Original building Multnomah County Library decided to consolidate the Woodstock and Sellwood-Moreland branches, both of which had struggled to operate in rented spaces for years. Construction of Woodstock's first permanent library building, located at 6008 SE 49th Avenue, began in 1959. The new library, measuring , was dedicated on June 1 the following year, the fourth community library built by Multnomah County. The president of the Library Association of Portland wrote in the organization's annual report: \\"Community response to this fine example of an adequate extension agency has been gratifying. This accelerated use fortifies the principle that excellent, strong book collections, strategically placed, provide economical and satisfactory extension [branch] service.\\" The library received regular maintenance and refurbishment from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, including repairs following a small fire. Capacity became strained as video and audiobook collections demanded additional shelf space and public use continued to grow. In 1995, the City of Portland's Bureau of Planning released the \\"Adopted Woodstock Neighborhood Plan\\", which included a policy to enhance the branch. Objectives included promoting its use, upgrading the facility and its services, improving cyclist and pedestrian access, and strengthening its cultural and educational role within the community. In May 1996, Multnomah County voters passed a $28 million bond measure to renovate some branches and upgrade technology throughout the system. Multnomah County Library determined building reconstruction was necessary given multiple issues including electrical, lighting, mechanical, plumbing and structural problems, mold growth within the walls and underneath flooring, and non-compliance with earthquake engineering and Americans with Disabilities Act codes. Cost analysis revealed reconstruction was more effective than repairing the existing structure; additional factors included data and communications upgrades and the need for meeting space. Woodstock Library closed on January 17, 1999 and was demolished soon after. Many of its building materials were recycled or salvaged for reuse. Current building The library's main entrance, 2012 The current Woodstock Library building is at the intersection of one commercial street (SE Woodstock Boulevard) and one tree-lined residential street (SE 49th), which links to the Woodstock School and Woodstock Park. Measuring , it opened on March 14, 2000, the first branch within the Multnomah County Library system to undergo complete reconstruction. Architects were Folger Johnson and Donald Mayer as well as Thomas Hacker and Associates P.C. (also referred to as Thomas Hacker Architects Inc. or THA Architecture). Becca Cavell served as project architect, project manager and construction administrator. Some of the building's architectural features were designed by the engineering firm Degenkolb Engineers. Contractor services were provided by McCarthy Building Companies, Inc. Exposed steel roof supported by steel columns Designers had in mind a \\"lantern-like\\" quality for the library, \\"open, light and inviting\\". THA said the goal was to create a \\"feeling of openness and availability\\", with a focus on \\"books and people\\". Most of the library's collection is housed within a single large room level with the sidewalk outside. The building has an exposed gridded steel roof high, supported by six pairs of slender steel columns and lined with windows. From several column options, Degenkolb chose cantilevered columns designed in a cruciform shape, built from four steel angles measuring . The columns taper from the top and provide even distribution of loads, protecting the structure against wind and earthquakes without lateral bracing (or the need for supporting walls). The library features a 32-person capacity meeting room for hosting community events at no charge on a first come, first served basis. The building houses original artwork, including a work by Margot Voorhies-Thompson and, at the entrance, a 15-line poem by Kim Stafford titled \\"Open This Door of All Doors\\". The exterior includes 36 stainless steel panels etched with words depicting the history of books. Kari Hauge became the first librarian of the new facility. In addition to offering the Multnomah County Library catalog of two million books, periodicals and other materials, the Woodstock Library houses collections in Chinese and Spanish and employs Chinese-speaking staff. Self-checkout stations and radio frequency identification gates were installed in July 2010. The current library has received several awards for quality design, engineering and lighting. The current building has received several design awards. In 2000, the American Institute of Steel Construction awarded Degenkolb with the I.D.E.A.S. Merit Award for quality structural engineering. Thomas Hacker Architects was presented with the 2002 AIA Regional Honor Award by the Northwest and Pacific Region of the American Institute of Architects through its Design Awards Program; jurors noted the library's \\"rigorous but poetic\\" structure and its \\"outstanding tectonic harmony, from the smallest scale of details to the basic design concept\\". The building also received the 2000 AIA Portland Chapter Honor Award, the 2000 Portland General Electric EarthSmart Award, the 2001 AIA American Library Association Award of Excellence (for its \\"simple and elegant design\\") and the 2002 Chicago Athenaeum American Architecture Award. The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America presented an award for the library's quality lighting design. Ginnie Cooper, director of libraries for Multnomah County, said of the recognition: \\"Library users love this building and we're pleased with how much the architectural community has applauded it as well.\\" The Woodstock Library became a model project for library branch reconstruction in the region. Other libraries designed and built by Thomas Hacker include the Beaverton City Library, the Belmont Library, the Bend Library and the Penrose Library (Whitman College). Community role Over the years both Woodstock Library buildings have hosted numerous activities, clubs, events and programs. According to the \\"Adopted Woodstock Neighborhood Plan\\", the Woodstock Library and Woodstock Community Center enhance the Village Center's role within the community as a \\"gathering place\\". Recent examples include appearances by actors and authors, a clown show, \\"conversation circles\\" for non-native English speakers, crafting, cultural celebrations, knitting groups, a mobile zoo, and neighborhood organization meetings and storytelling. The library has also hosted town hall meetings and serves as a ballot drop-off site during elections.

They self-released four EPs between 2007 and 2011. In early 2011, they were 'discovered' by producer Richard Swift after handing him one of their EPs at a The Mynabirds show in New York. The group were later signed on to Jagjaguwar Records and their first studio album, Take the Kids Off Broadway, was released by Jagjaguwar on July 24, 2012. On January 22, 2013, Jagjaguwar released Foxygen's second album, We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic. This album was produced by Richard Swift and recorded at his National Freedom studio. The record was preceded by the single \\"Shuggie,\\" released on October 4, 2012.Fitzmaurice, Larry (October 4, 2012). Pitchfork. Retrieved October 15, 2012. In March 2013, Foxygen was named one of Fuse TV's 30 must-see artists at SXSW. In 2019, We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic came at no.11 on Happy Mag's list of \\"The 25 best psychedelic rock albums of the 2010s\\". The band has gained a reputation for its unhinged live shows and maniacal behavior of lead singer France. In 2014, for their tours promoting the sprawling double album ‚Ä¶And Star Power, the group expanded to a nine-piece live band including three back-up singer/dancers. The band released their fourth LP, the theatrical Hang, on January 20, 2017, via Jagjaguwar. The album features collaborations with The Lemon Twigs, the Flaming Lips' Steven Drozd and a 40+ piece orchestra arranged by Trey Pollard and Matthew E White. The Irish Times said of the album: ‚ÄúTheatrical is an apt description of this collection as a whole,\\" while noting that the album \\"edges perilously close to pastiche\\". The new album was admittedly referred to as a concept album by Sam France and Jonathan Rado themselves. The duo expressed their hope to create an album characterized by rock music mixing with the Hollywood style musical at the 30s. Allegedly, Hang is their first ever album to be recorded in a studio, prior to this their albums and songs written were all conducted at home.Daniel Durchholz, [\\"Music Foxygen takes on Hollywood ‚Äì what a concept!\\"],St. Louis Post-Dispatch, August 4, 2017 The duo also see the characters on the album as a continuation of their previous records. Greenhaus, Mike https://relix.com/articles/detail/foxygen_through_the_doors_of_perception/ Relix In February 2019, they announced an April 26 release of a new album, Seeing Other People, via Jagjaguwar. The lead single is called \\"Livin‚Äô A Lie\\". Critical reception The Entertainment Weekly staff wrote, \\"We just can't stop playing the scruffy psych-rock duo's Rolling Stones-obsessed album with the appropriately exuberant title We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic.\\" In January 2013, Pitchfork cited Foxygen under \\"Best New Music\\" in their review of the new album. Their 2014 album, the Todd Rundgren-influenced ...And Star Power received decidedly mixed reviews. While Paste praised it as \\"...indulgent, unhinged, sprawling, funny and sometimes spookily great,\\" and Slant Magazine called it a \\"dense and rewarding listen,\\" other critics like Hal Horowitz at American Songwriter called it \\"...an occasionally interesting failed experiment.\\" Discography ;Studio albums *Jurrassic Exxplosion Phillipic (2007) *Take the Kids Off Broadway (2011) *We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic (2013) *...And Star Power (2014) *Hang (2017) *Seeing Other People (2019) ;Extended plays *Electric Sun Machine (2005) *Catfood, Dogfood, Motor Oil (2005) *Ghettoplastikk!

History This genus was created in 1911 by DakinDakin WJ (1911) Notes on a new coccidian Merocystis kathae (n. gen. et sp.,) occurring in the renal organ of the whelk. Arch. Protist XXIII: 1115 He discovered this parasite - Merocystis kathae - in the renal organ of the whelk (Buccinum undatum). Its life cycle has been studied in some detail by other workers. A second species was described - Merocystis tellinovum - by Buchanan in 1979 but this has since been moved to the genus Pseudoklossia. Taxonomy There is one species known in this genus. Description The life cycle follows a seasonal course. The earliest stages may appear in the kidney any time between March and June. Growth proceeds and sexual differentiation takes place but mature gametes are not found until November, when the first stages of sporogony are first found. Mature spores containing sporozoites are formed in January and become increasingly common up to May. Degenerating stages of spores are common in summer. The earliest stages within the renal organ are 10 ¬µm in diameter. To the naked eye the later stages of the parasite have the appearance of a rounded milky white dot. The trophozoites appear opaque and occasionally granular. Schizogony occurs in the host cell. Morphological sexual differentiation is not detectable until growth is almost complete. The microgametocyte divides into 32 nuclei. At this stage cleavage of the cytoplasm brings about the formation of uninucleate cytomeres. Nuclear division again occurs within these and these latter divisions form the microgametes. The microgamete possesses a dark centre and a lighter ring round the periphery and is released from the host cell. Fertilization occurs within the lumen of the renal organ. After fertilisation, a thick membrane forms outside the zygote. The nucleus assumes a characteristic spindle shape and subsequently divides. Nuclear divisions proceed until numerous cone shaped nuclei are found below the cell membrane. This cell membrane becomes folded and the nuclei sink in (the oocyst stage). Each is surrounded by a portion of cytoplasm to form a sporoblast. A single nuclear division then occurs and the two nuclei elongate to form sporozoites each with a small cytoplasmic body. The oocyst has numerous sporocysts each with two sporozoites.

Since its foundation in 1967 it has been attended by over 100,000 students. The legal head office is located at La Maddalena and the base of operations is situated on the island of Caprera, on the Maddalena archipelago. CVC is a non-profit organisation and a member of the ISSA (International Sailing School Association). History The school was founded in 1967 based upon the ideas of Vittorio di Sambuy and Marco Notarbartolo di Sciara, who was, at the time, president of Milan‚Äôs section of the Italian Navy League. The two authors of the idea were granted the land where the center of the Admiral Alessandro Michelagnoli, at the time Commander in Chief of the Italian Navy, was built. Franco Brambilla, president of the Touring Club Italiano, joined the association guaranteeing the organizational and administrative support of the Touring Club. Finally, Guido Colnaghi, who represented the French association √âcole des Gl√©nans in Italy, shaped the teaching spirit and approach that distinguishes the character of the CVC. The two founding members, Milan‚Äôs section of the Italian Navy League and the Touring Club, were then joined by the Students Association in 1975. Objectives of the school and Course progression The Centro Velico Caprera, school of sea and sailing, has as its main objective the knowledge and education of the sail training‚Äôs basis through practice and experimentation to ensure a safe growth. Another goal is to transmit the fundamentals of maritime consciousness, essential for later offshore sailing. For this reason, life‚Äôs organization both on base and on the boats is modeled to transmit to the students the life of a crew. There are three levels of courses: *1st or beginner level: sailing dinghies or small cabin cruisers; *2nd level: high performance dinghies or short voyages on cabin cruisers; *3rd level: racing dinghies (semi-skiff), 8 meter racing cruisers, or long range voyages on large cabin cruisers. The schools location The CVC is located in the southwest part of the island of Caprera, between Punta Coda and the gulf of Porto Palma, and is composed of 3 separate bases. On the side of Punta Coda, the beginner level base consists of military buildings used as dormitories, classrooms, and a canteen. The second base is at the foot of the Fico Mountain, and hosts the students of the 2nd level. The third base, located on the western end of Porto Palma, hosts all students taking courses on cabin cruisers. Furthermore, the CVC staff operates a carpentry, a mechanical workshop and a sail repairing facility. Life on the base A typical day at CVC is planned on a tight schedule that all members of the community must respect. Every day students alternate between practical and theoretical lessons, with meals in between. Once a week every student gives his contribute to the school by cleaning the base and helping the cook and the Chief of Operations, who is in charge of the kitchen. The instructors The instructors at CVC are all volunteers who are chosen among the school‚Äôs best students. After being recommended, which happens through the evaluation of technical knowledge and social skills, in order to become an instructor the student must pass successfully a training course which takes place in spring and autumn. The Instructional positions at CVC are: * On boat assistant (AdV) * Instructor (Is) * Rescue boat captain (CB) There is a principal instructor for every course, known as: * Course Manager (CT) The base is managed by a: * Base Supervisor There is also a: * Chief of Operations (AT) Who coordinates the students while they clean the base and help in the kitchen.

There is limited evidence on safety and effectiveness as of 2017. It is not included in medical guidelines as of 2017. It is a type of autologous blood therapy. Medical use There is limited evidence on safety and effectiveness as of 2017. There is tentative evidence in osteoarthritis. Its use has not been recommended or considered by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International. Process The process removes about of blood from a patient's arm, which is then incubated at a slightly raised temperature. The liquid is then placed in a centrifuge until its constituent parts are separated. That serum is injected into the patient's affected area. History Autologous conditioned serum is a patented method developed by molecular biologist Julio Reinecke and Peter Wehling, a spinal surgeon in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. Orthokine was first approved for use in Germany in 2003. Orthokine differs from a similar procedure with platelet-rich plasma (PRP), where platelets are targeted instead of the interleukin antagonist. Also, PRP does not require the blood to be heated as Orthokine does. As of August 2012, about 60,000 patients worldwide have received the treatment. Americans have traveled to Germany for the treatment, which has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Freddie Fu, a professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Pittsburgh, said more high-quality independent trials proving the procedure's effectiveness are needed before the FDA approves.

Collisions =With Palembang, January 1942= On 8 January 1942 Norefjord was part of Convoy HX 169 from Nova Scotia en route to Great Britain when she collided with the Dutch ship . Both ships were damaged and returned to port for repairs. Norefjord returned to service by sailing with Convoy HX 175 on 13 February but again she returned to port. On 19 February Norefjord sailed with Convoy HX-176. This time she successfully completed the voyage, reaching Liverpool, England on 6 March 1942. =With Alcoa Rambler, August 1942= On 16 August 1942 Norefjord reached Halifax, Nova Scotia with Convoy BX 33 from Boston, Massachusetts. Having arrived, Norefjord was in Bedford Basin when she collided with the US cargo ship . Norefjord was damaged in the collision and subsequently beached. Alcoa Rambler had been proceeding seawards, down the fairway, heading south-southeast. Rambler was laden with a cargo of explosives, was being escorted by a naval launch, and both Rambler and her escort were flying the warning flags required under local regulations. Norefjord had been crossing the fairway on an easterly course. It was daylight and the two ships sighted each other at a range of about . The basin was congested with other ships, a number of changes of course were required, and Norefjord had repeatedly changed her course further to port before the two ships collided. The case between the owners of the two ships came to court in 1949 and its implications are now referred to in a guide to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. Stranded and shelled, August 1958 On 14 August 1958 Norse Lady was off Parigi, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia when she ran aground. On 16 August Permesta rebels captured her, refloated her and took her about east to Belang in the rebels' heartland in Minahasa, North Sulawesi. The rebels beached Norse Lady at Belang, but the Indonesian Navy sighted her there on 18 August, shelled her on 22 August and she was burnt out. In March 1966 Hong Kong purchasers bought her wreck.

It was built between 1881 and 1884 according to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont. Contrasting with the French forts built in the same era by Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res, the fort was built exclusively of unreinforced concrete, a new material, rather than masonry. The fort was heavily bombarded by German artillery in the Battle of Li√®ge. Boncelles was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the fortified position of Li√®ge in an attempt to forestall or slow an attack from Germany. It saw action in 1940 during the Battle of Belgium, and was captured by German forces. It is abandoned and partly buried, surrounded by housing. Description The Fort de Boncelles is located about south of the center of Li√®ge. The fort forms an isosceles triangle whose base is long and whose sides measure . A deep by ditch encircles the fort. The principal armament was concentrated in the central massif. The ditches were defended in enfilade by 57mm guns in casemates resembling counterscarp batteries, firing at shot traps at the other end of the ditch. It is one of the larger forts of Li√®ge. With the exception of the Fort de Loncin, the Belgian forts made little provision for the daily needs of their wartime garrisons, locating latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue in the fort's counterscarp, a location that would be untenable in combat. This would have profound effects on the forts' ability to endure a long assault. The service areas were placed directly opposite the barracks, which opened into the ditch in the rear of the fort (i.e., in the face towards Li√®ge), with lesser protection than the two \\"salient\\" sides. The Brialmont forts placed a weaker side to the rear to allow for recapture by Belgian forces from the rear, and located the barracks and support facilities on this side, using the rear ditch for light and ventilation of living spaces. In combat heavy shellfire made the rear ditch untenable, and German forces were able to get between the forts and attack them from the rear.Donnell, p. 36 The Brialmont forts were designed to be protected from shellfire equaling their heaviest guns: 21 cm.Donnell, p. 52 The top of the central massif used of unreinforced concrete, while the caserne walls, judged to be less exposed, used .Donnell, p. 12 Under fire, the forts were damaged by 21 cm fire and could not withstand heavier artillery.Donnell, pp. 45-48 Armament Boncelles' armament included a two rotating Gr√ºsonwerke turrets with two 21 cm guns, a15cm Creusot turret with twin guns and two 12 cm Ch√¢tillon-Commentry turret with two guns, all for distant targets. Four retractable 57 mm Gr√ºsonwerke gun turrets were provided for local defense. The fort also mounted an observation turret with a searchlight. Eight rapid-fire 57 mm Gr√ºsonwerke guns were provided in casemates for the defense of the ditches and the postern, as well as two mobile guns. The fort's heavy guns were German, typically Krupp, while the turret mechanisms were from a variety of sources. The fort was provided with signal lights to permit communication with the neighboring Fort de Fl√©malle across the Meuse and Fort d'Embourg across the Ourthe. The guns were fired using black powder rather than smokeless powder, producing choking gas in the confined firing spaces that spread throughout the fort.Donnell, p. 17 First World War The Li√®ge forts Boncelles first came under attack on 6 August 1914. Because the Li√®ge fortifications had proved to be unexpectedly stubborn, the Germans brought heavy siege artillery to bombard the forts with shells far larger than they were designed to resist. Boncelles resisted until the 14th, when it was unable to continue to resist due to the asphyxiating fumes that permeated the fort.Donnell, pp. 45-49 In 1915 the Germans undertook an improvement program for the Li√®ge positions, modifying entrances, adding concrete cover and adding metal decking under concrete ceilings. Non- structural improvements included forced ventilation and moving latrines, kitchens and the bakery into the main fort. Fortified Position of Li√®ge Boncelles postern Boncelle's armament was upgraded in the 1930s to become part of the Fortified Position of Li√®ge II, which was planned to deter a German incursion over the nearby border.Donnell, pp. 55-56Kauffmann, p. 105 Protection was substantially increased. This was accompanied by improvements to ventilation, protection, sanitary facilities, communications and electrical power. A fortified air intake tower was provided to improve ventilation. Second World War The fort was bombarded from the air and by artillery in May 1940 by the Germans, killing the commandant, Numa Charlier, and others of the garrison. The fort was taken on May 16: it did not surrender.Donnell, p. 61 The Germans occupied the fort until 1944, using it as an anti-aircraft position. It became a military depot after the war, and was sold to the commune of Seraing in 1983. Present The fort is mostly buried and inaccessible, tightly hemmed in by housing that follows the trace of the former ditch. Only the postern, central massif, air intake tower and two nearby bunkers remain. The site includes a memorial to the dead of World Wars I and II, and a small cemetery. A museum opened next to the fort at the end of 2012.

Product defects arise most prominently in legal contexts regarding product safety, where the term is applied to \\"anything that renders the product not reasonably safe\\".Patricia A. Robinson, Writing and Designing Manuals and Warnings (2009), p. 234. The field of law that addresses injuries caused by defective products is called product liability. A wide range of circumstances can render a product defective. The product may have a design defect or design flaw, resulting from the product having been poorly designed or tested, so that the design itself yields a product that can not perform its desired function. Even if the design is correct, the product may have a manufacturing defect if it was incorrectly manufactured, for example if the wrong materials are used. A product may also be considered legally defective if it lacks appropriate instructions for its use, or appropriate warnings of dangers accompanying normal use or misuse of the product. A product that is defective in some way that does not render it dangerous might still be sold, with a discounted price reflecting the defect. For example, where a clothing manufacturer's inspection discovers that a line of shirts have been made with slightly uneven sleeves, the manufacturer may choose to sell these shirts at a discount, often through an outlet store and with the label cut off to indicate that the quality is not intended to reflect on the brand.Ellen Ruppel Shell, Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture (2009).

The film covers Dr. Fred Urquhart's nearly 40-year-long scientific investigation into the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), tracking the details of what is considered one of the longest known insect migrations: the flight of the monarch butterfly from Central Mexico to the United States and Canada and back. Synopsis Female monarch Monarch butterflies are a familiar sight in the United States and Canada most of the year, but disappear from most locations in winter. The documentary film weaves together factual information about the monarchs with a dramatic re-enactment of the search for the answer to the mystery of where they spend the winter. The story line follows Urquhart as a child in Canada, fascinated by the butterflies; his years of research and study, together with his wife and collaborator Norah, into their life and migration; and their recruitment of a pair of amateur naturalists in Mexico to search for and ultimately find the butterflies there, concluding with his time decades later as a senior scientist looking back at his investigations and discoveries about the insect's life pattern. In addition to finding the overwintering sites, he discovered that it takes two or three generations for the monarch butterflies to reach the Canadian breeding grounds, while one much-longer-lived \\"supergeneration\\" makes the return trip south into central Mexico. Cast * Megan Follows as Narrator * Gordon Pinsent as Dr Fred Urquhart * Shaun Benson as Ken Brugger * Patricia Phillips as Norah Urquhart * Sof√≠a Sisniega as Chloe * Stephanie Sigman as Catalina Aguado * Jayden Greig as Ice cream boy Production With Mike Slee announced as director, the film went into principal development in February 2007. In August 2007, the U.S. National Science Foundation awarded a three million dollar grant to Canadian SK Films to both develop the film for the giant screen and create its educational outreach program. The grant amount is the maximum available from the NSF. Filming took place through 2011 and 2012, and tracked the butterflies from their winter habitats in central Mexico to their breeding grounds in the southern United States to their summer habitat in Canada, and their subsequent return to Mexico. In filming the butterflies, director Slee considered using balloons, helicopters, and cables, but ultimately decided on use of a 70-foot crane. SK Films announced that principal filming of the one-year project was completed in early March 2012. Release The film had its world premiere on September 24, 2012, at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., hosted by the Federal government of Mexico, through the Mexico Tourism Board and the Embassy of Mexico. An early version of the film was screened at the Maryland Science Center on March 31, 2012, and the completed IMAX version distributed and screened in early October 2012 at various 3D IMAX theaters such as the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, New Jersey. Portions of the film's box office receipts went to fund butterfly conservation efforts. Reception The film has been favorably received by multiple sources. Variety compared the film to March of the Penguins, writing that as a non-commercial film, it \\"neatly balances entertainment and education\\" in a manner \\"bound to fascinate schoolchildren\\", and offered that its 3D IMAX visuals were phenomenal. Washington Post declared the film a \\"critic's pick\\", and in praising the film's 3D IMAX realism, noted the film wove together the life and studies of Dr. Fred Urquhart and the life cycle of the monarch butterfly from egg to caterpillar to chrysalis to adult insect, adding that it resulted in \\"an educational but equally engrossing bit of filmmaking\\" that was \\"armchair travel at its most engaging\\". They also favorably compared the film against March of the Penguins for its ability \\"to tug at heartstrings\\", and make the viewer feel personally invested in Urquhart's quest. Ottawa Citizen wrote that Fred Urquhart's search of discovery into the life of the monarch butterfly was \\"a remarkable story\\" and capturing it made \\"a stunning documentary that fills the screen.\\" Slashfilm offered that before major studios recognized the financial potential of IMAX big screens for releases of blockbuster productions, the \\"theaters primarily played nature and science documentaries\\". They welcomed the return of such to IMAX theaters through Flight of the Butterflies. And in noting the film's imminent October release, and the number of blockbuster films now being offered in the big-screen 3D format, The Film Stage offered it as a net positive that IMAX theaters will \\"have a balance of blockbusters and nature films.\\" References External links  Category:Documentary films about nature Category:Canadian 3D films Category:Canadian documentary films Category:Canadian films Category:IMAX short films Category:Documentary films about science Category:Butterflies Category:2012 in science Category:IMAX documentary films Category:3D short films Category:3D documentary films ","title":"Flight of the Butterflies"},{"id":"36721540","text":"Adolf Wagner (July 23, 1911 - June 9, 1984) was a German weightlifter who competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal in middleweight category.

He is a diabetologist in his home town of Pothatturpettai. He represented Pallipattu from 1996‚Äì2001 and 2006‚Äì2011. Early life Raman was born to E. S. Subramaniam Mudaliar and Saradha from Sengunthar Kaikola Mudaliar(Echaan gothram) family in Pothatturpettai in Thiruvallur district in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. His grandfather, Sanjeeviyar, was the district board member during 1937 for the Chittoor district and the president of the local panchayat (unopposed). His father, a rationalist close to veteran Dravidian movement leaders Periyar E. V. Ramasamy and C. N. Annadurai, was a candidate of behalf of the Tamil People's Party in the first post independence elections in 1952, in which he lost to his nearest rival by 1,021 votes. He was instrumental in getting his father's younger brother E. S. Thyagarajan Mudaliar elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in 1971. Raman is the only son in his family; he has ten sisters. His family interests covered farming, textile and educational institutions. Medical career After graduating in 1978 from Kilpauk Medical College, Chennai, Raman was hired by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission as Medical Officer at the government primary health centre in his home town. He headed that from 1978 to 1988, after which he joined Madras Medical College for his post-graduate studies. Later, he joined the faculty of Stanley Medical College and resigned his government job to partake in politics actively. During his tenure, he implemented a low cost sanitary latrine program known as RCAP. In his jurisdiction, he successfully completed 500 such RCAP latrines without requesting any financial help from the government. For this achievement, the Government of Tamil Nadu nominated Raman for a World Health Organization award in the amount of $US 5,000. He was the first person recommended for said award. Political career Raman was district co- convener of the medical wing of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee from 1989 to 1996. He was a supporter of G. K. Moopanar, political heir of K. Kamaraj. After breaking away from Congress in 1996, Moopanar formed a separate regional political party called the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC). Raman followed Moopanar and was fielded as the new party candidate for Pallipattu assembly constituency by Moopanar in 1996. Raman won with a margin of 58,492 votes; all his opponents lost their deposits. Moopanar nominated Raman as the District President of his party (1998‚Äì2001). After the death of Moopanar, G. K. Vasan merged TMC with its parent organisation, the Indian National Congress (INC), under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi in 2002. As a follower of Vasan, Raman was appointed the State Organising Secretary for Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (2002 to till date). Raman served as the District Election Officer for Salem district and Election Observer for Coimbatore and Erode districts (organisational elections) of the TMC. Later after the merger of TMC with INC, Raman served as the High Command Observer for Thanjavur district, the native district of his mentors Moopanar and Vasan, by All India Congress Committee (AICC). Raman was selected for a second time to contest Pallipattu, this time in the 2006 state assembly elections. He won again. In 2009, Raman was appointed the All India Congress Observer (Pre-Poll ‚àí2009) for Andhra Pradesh by Gandhi for three parliamentary constituencies and 21 assembly constituencies (Nandyal, Anantapur and Kurnool parliament constituencies); his observations proved nearly 100% successful and he was lauded for the same. Raman left the INC when Vasan re-floated the TMC in November 2014. He was appointed as State vice-president of the party in 2015. Author Raman has written many books in Tamil, namely Isaipada vazhvom, Paalvinai Noigal, Neeryizhivu Noyalikku Vazhakai Muraigal, Naalvar Sutriya Naangu Nadugal, Maruthuvathin Maru Pakkam, and Padhivugal. His book on diabetes won him the first prize from the government of Tamil Nadu for the best Tamil medical book, for which he was given a cash reward and citation by the then Chief Minister, M. G. Ramachandran. The same book was released as an audio cassette, a novel venture at that time, in 1983 for the benefit of patients who can listen better than reading. Raman also wrote a biography of Moopanar in the form of poems with rare photographs of the leader. Raman has contributed many articles to popular Tamil dailies and other periodicals including Dinamani, Daily Thanthi, Kalki, Manavam, Manavarism, Desiya Murasu and All India Radio. He was a regular writer for Junior Vikatan and Kumudam Reporter, the popular bi- weekly magazines of Tamil Nadu, on Tamil Nadu Assembly proceedings (as a critic) between 2006‚Äì2009. He has also worked as a cover artist and illustrator for many magazines including Alai Osai, Manavam, Manarism, Murasoli and Vanoli. He contributed broadcast tributes to the Congress leader Kamaraj on the day of his death. Raman has travelled widely in and out of India. He undertook a tour to various countries including Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore in 1984 and wrote a travelogue on the same. He visited Malaysia and Singapore many other times. He visited the United States in 2011 and participated in the inauguration of a new Joslin Diabetes Center at Pontiac, Illinois. Philanthropy Following the example of his ancestors, Raman has established educational institutions in his home town in memory of his father (1909‚Äì1977). ESSM Teacher Training Institute, ESSM College of Education, and ESSM College of Arts and Science serve the needs of the locality and particularly benefit the education of women.

Created by producer Bradley Bell, she is portrayed by actress Linsey Godfrey. She is the daughter of media mogul Karen Spencer (Joanna Johnson), niece of media mogul Bill Spencer Jr. (Don Diamont), and namesake of her aunt, Caroline Spencer Forrester (Johnson). Casting On February 7, 2012, it was announced that Joanna Johnson would reprise the role of Karen Spencer and would be arriving alongside her never- before-heard-of-and-seen daughter Caroline, the namesake of deceased twin sister Caroline Spencer. It was announced that actress Linsey Godfrey was cast into the new role. Godfrey is known for her roles on several television series such as NCIS, One Tree Hill, and Wizards of Waverly Place. The character, while unknown to viewers, would be acknowledged and known to those on-screen. In April 2012, it was announced that Crystal Chappell would enter the cast of the series as Caroline's second mother, in the series' first ever lesbian storyline. Godfrey has a tattoo to symbolize her successful battle with Hodgkin's lymphoma, which the producers wrote into the show. In February 2014, Godfrey alongside Jacob Young crossed over to The Young and the Restless, airing from April 11 to 16, 2014. In December 2016, Godfrey was put on recurring status with the show. In May 2017, Godfrey told Soap Opera Digest that she hasn't heard from the show since her last appearance on October 31, 2016. That same month, Godfrey announced she was back taping at the serial. Godfrey made her re-appearance from July to September 2017 and then in March 2018. In July 2018, it was announced that Godfrey had joined the cast of Days of Our Lives, effectively ending her run as Caroline. Character development Caroline's initial storyline revolves around a storyline about her and her same-sex mothers, Karen (Joanna Johnson) and Danielle Spencer (Crystal Chappell), entitled \\"My Two Moms\\". Caroline was noted by head writer Bradley Bell and writers Patrick Mulcahey and Tracey Ann Kelly to represent a younger generational view of her mother's sexuality; Kelly stated: \\"She did not understand the need to feel secretive, whereas her mother, having dealt with this in a much different time, felt very different about it. So I felt it was wonderful to see the generational difference in the attitude.\\" Caroline's importance in the storyline was a key aspect, as her mothers had their \\"hands full\\" while coming together to help Caroline deal with her own problems. The role of Caroline was involved in three romances, first with Thomas Forrester (Adam Gregory, then Pierson Fod√©), before she moved on to his arch-rival Rick Forrester (Jacob Young). She then married Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss, then Thorsten Kaye). Rick falls out of love with Caroline and begins falling for an underprivileged aspiring actress, Maya Avant (Karla Mosley); he attempts to dump her but Caroline begins scheming to remove Maya from his life. By this point, she was described by Jamey Giddens of the website Zap2it as \\"cunning\\" and scheming \\"blonde vixen\\", enjoying her new \\"fantastically-bitchy\\" persona. Joanna Johnson, upon her return to the series, characterized Caroline as having changed into \\"a total bad-ass crazy person\\" who needed \\"mothering\\". Speaking on her character's progression, Godfrey explained: \\"I really love the dimension that [the writers] added to Caroline because when I first came on the show, she was this very sweet and very meek girl. Then she became this very sassy, aggressive 'mean girl.' I was so excited when they turned her into a layered woman who had these very strong thoughts and opinions and didn‚Äôt back down to anyone, but she also wasn‚Äôt being a catty little girl any more. She was just strong.\\" Storylines In March 2012, Karen Spencer (Joanna Johnson) returned to town with a surprise trip for her daughter, Caroline to Los Angeles for an interview at Forrester Creations. Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss) plan to use Caroline's arrival as a collaborator for Rick Forrester (Jacob Young) and his new line, while Brooke has ulterior motives to use her as a distraction for Rick from Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz). Upon arrival, both Brooke and Ridge offer a trial deal with Caroline, sparking concern with Karen over their intentions, especially those of Brooke. Caroline accepts the job, as well as Rick. At a welcoming party at the Forrester Estate, Caroline is introduced to everyone in the company. She is, however, given a very dishonest welcome and toast by Amber. She later admits that she felt like she had a special kinship with her aunt Caroline (Johnson), and announced her decision to bring The Caroline Spencer Cancer Foundation, a research fund she runs for her aunt, to Los Angeles. And the party, Ridge brings Caroline to the guest house where he stayed with Caroline, where he shared several memories about Caroline including the charm bracelet he gave to her. She then revealed to Ridge the cancer ribbon she got in honor of Caroline, located on the back of her neck. As Caroline begins to grow a deeper connection to Rick, Amber begins to manipulate her into believing he enjoys dressing in drag. She catches him in photos wearing dresses, lipstick and walking the Forrester runway in five-inch heels. This continues to drive her away from Rick, believing he is playing her and not being truthful about his true intentions. She then begins to develop a relationship with Thomas Forrester (Adam Gregory); as her relationship intensifies with him, she introduces him to Karen and her life partner, Danielle (Crystal Chappell). They also work together to free Marcus Barber Forrester (Texas Battle) from charges accusing him of running over his friend, Anthony, the night before his wedding to Dayzee Leigh (Kristolyn Lloyd).

It is a common term in Turkish and Mongol mythologies. After death, all shamans become shamanic souls, ongod. Idols can be consecrated to them within three years of the shaman's death and can be placed in the home (\\"home ongon\\") or in another locale, such as a shelter out in the open (\\"field ongon\\"). The ongon is also the physical representation of that spirit, made by a shaman, which plays a central part in the ritual that invokes the protection of the spirit. One well-known such spirit is Dayan Deerh. The ongon is particularly important in black shamanism: the main function of the khar talynkh or black shaman is to bring people into contact with the ongon, whose spirit they call up \\"while drumming in a trance\\". In late-nineteenth century Mongolia, according to Otgony Purev, yellow shamanism revered ongon as well, and every three years yellow shamans gathered in Dayan Deerh monastery in Kh√∂vsg√∂l Province to \\"renew\\" these ancestral spirits. Physical representation Ongod are represented in the physical world in various ways. In the case of the Tuvan shamaness Yamaan, an ancestor spirit is represented in the handle of a drum, a carved figure with a pink head and chest, a black crown, and red eyes and forehead. A wire serves as arms, and on another wire holbogo are suspended to indicate the spirit's earring. Some ongon live on in the place inhabited by the shaman: Agaaryn Khairhan, a mountain in Kh√∂vsg√∂l Province, takes its name from one of the most powerful shamanesses of the Darkhad clan, Agaaryn Khairhan or Bagdan Udgan, who lived on the mountain in the eighteenth century. In present-day Northern Mongolia, specifically the Darkhad Valley, clusters of ongod are found in transitional or liminal locations, such as the mouths of rivers or the borders between taiga and steppe: In Darkhad Valley, the taiga and surrounding mountains are the traditional areas dominated by shamanism, where the steppe is dominated by Buddhism. Many Darkhad households own talismans, \\"lineage talismans\\" (yazguur ongod) or \\"household talismans\\" (geriin ongod), that both contain and attract spirits.

It wasn't until 1829 that official records for the distillery show up. After running into financial difficulty, the distillery closed in 1870 before being renamed Glenburgie in 1871. It re-opened in 1878, under Charles Kay. There were ownership changes and around 1880 it came into the possession of Alex Fraser and Company. It was then incorporated in 1895. This situation lasted 30 years; it was liquidated in 1925, and then was closed again between 1927 and 1935. Around that time the distillery was run by Margaret Nichol, considered the first female manager of any whisky distillery. The distillery was sold to Hiram Walker in 1936. In a new rejuvenation in 1958, two Lomond stills were installed, alongside the existing stills. The whisky distilled in these stills was kept separate from the rest of the whisky produced by the distillery, and sold under the name Glencraig. Production continued up until 1981 when the experiment with Lomond stills was abandoned, and the stills were replaced with regular stills. In 2000, production stopped entirely at Glenburgie. The distillery was completely rebuilt in 2003-2004, only retaining the stills from the old distillery. Soon after, in 2006 another two stills were added, bringing the total production capacity to 4,200,000 litres of pure alcohol per year. Distillery The distillery is located on an estate at the Mill Buie hills near Kinloss. Production Most of the whisky distilled at Glenburgie is used for blends, most importantly Ballantine's, but also Old Smuggler.

Chinese Taipei, Dominican Republic, Palestine, Qatar and Zimbabwe made their Olympic debuts in equestrian events.               * =Officials= Appointment of officials was as follows:https://data.fei.org/Calendar/ShowDetail.aspx?p=D27E1E3AE6653C86D3C95F40AEF01F97 ;Dressage * Maribel Alonso de Quinzanos (Ground Jury President) * Stephen Clarke (Ground Jury Member) * Eduard de Wolff-van Westerrode (Ground Jury Member) * Susanne Baarup (Ground Jury Member) * Gary Rockwell (Ground Jury Member) * Peter Holler (Ground Jury Member) * Thomas Lang (Ground Jury Member) * Jacques van Daele (Technical Delegate) ;Jumping * Stephan Ellenbruch (Ground Jury President) * Alfred K.

Riders placing first through 60th (including ties for 60th place) advance to the second round. The top 45 riders of round 2, including ties for 45th, advance to the third round. The top 35 riders of the third round progress to the 4th round, but only up to three riders per team (so if a country has four riders in the top 35, one of those is not allowed to compete for individual medals). In the fourth round (individual final round A), the slate is wiped clean and all riders begin with zero faults. The top 20 riders in round 4 advance to round 5 (individual final round B), and ride another course. The faults for individual final round A and B and added together to determine individual medals. The team competition completes three rounds to determine medals. It runs concurrently with the individual competition (riders running over the same course) so team riders are also competing for individual medals. The first round for team competition is the round 2 course for individual medals. The top eight teams from the first team round advance to the second team round (which is the same course as the individual round 3). The scores for these eight countries over team rounds 1 and 2 are combined, and medals are awarded based on those scores. =Dressage= Teams are made of up to four riders, all of whom are also competing concurrently for individual medals. Additionally, countries who can not make a full team may send riders to compete for individual medals. All riders compete in the Grand Prix, which serves as the first round of both the individual and team medals. The top six teams (included those tied for 6th) advance to the Grand Prix Special, which is a slightly more rigorous test. The combined scores of the top three riders of those teams in both the Grand Prix and the Special determine the team medals, with the team with the highest score winning gold. Riders completing the Grand Prix test (first qualifying round of the individual competition) may move on to the Grand Prix Special (second qualifying round for the individual competition) if their team is in the top six (24 riders total). Additionally, the top 8 riders who do not qualify with a team may also advance to the Special to ride for individual medals. The top 18 riders from the Special move on to the third individual round, the freestyle. However, no more than three members on a team may advance. Each rider designs their own test for the freestyle, which must be set to music and has several compulsory movements. Riders can tailor a test to their horses' strengths, as well as incorporate movements that are more difficult than those required in the Grand Prix or the Special (such as a pirouette in piaffe) in order to increase their scores. As the slate is wiped clean after the first two rounds, individual medals are assigned based on scores in the freestyle. =Eventing= Competitions for team and individual medals ran concurrently. Riders performed a dressage test, a cross-country round, and a jumping round. Team medals were then awarded by adding together the best three scores from a country's team, out of a maximum of five team members, from all three phases, the team with the lowest number of penalty points winning the gold. The top 25 individual scores after the first show jumping round performed a second, final, show jumping round to determine individual medals, with up to 3 riders in the individual running per team. Therefore, those competing for individual spots completed one dressage test and cross-country round, and two jumping rounds. Medal summary The 2016 event was marked by returning champions in the individual events, and new nations winning the team events. 2012 Individual eventing champion Michael Jung retained his title, as did 2012 Individual dressage gold medallist, Great Britain's Charlotte Dujardin on Valegro. In jumping, veteran Nick Skelton, part of the gold medal winning Great Britain jumping team from 2012, returned to take the individual title on Big Star, his 2012 gold winning horse. In the team events, Germany displaced Great Britain from the top step of the Team Dressage podium, with the 2012 winners in silver, and the United States taking an unexpected bronze ahead of traditional powerhouse, the Netherlands. In Eventing and Jumping, France won the team gold medals. As a result, Germany, Great Britain and France dominated the medal table with two golds each, Germany leading by dint of four minor medals to the one silver each for France and Great Britain. =Medal table= =Medalists= { -valign=\\"top\\" Individual dressage    -valign=\\"top\\" Team dressage  Dorothee Schneider on Showtime FRH Kristina Br√∂ring-Sprehe on Desperados FRH Isabell Werth on Weihegold Old  Fiona Bigwood on Orthilia Carl Hester on Nip Tuck Charlotte Dujardin on Valegro  Allison Brock on Rosevelt Kasey Perry-Glass on Dublet Steffen Peters on Legolas Laura Graves on Verdades -bgcolor=#DDDDDD colspan=7 -valign=\\"top\\" Individual eventing    -valign=\\"top\\" Team eventing  Karim Laghouag on Entebbe Thibaut Vallette on Qing du Briot Mathieu Lemoine on Bart L Astier Nicolas on Piaf de B'Neville  Sandra Auffarth on Opgun Louvo Ingrid Klimke on Hale-Bob Old Michael Jung on Sam FBW  Shane Rose on CP Qualified Stuart Tinney on Pluto Mio Sam Griffiths on Paulank Brockagh Chris Burton on Santano II -bgcolor=#DDDDDD colspan=7 -valign=\\"top\\" Individual jumping    -valign=\\"top\\" Team jumping  Philippe Rozier on Rahotep de Toscane Kevin Staut on R√™veur de Hurtebise Roger-Yves Bost on Sydney une Prince P√©n√©lope Leprevost on Flora de Mariposa  Kent Farrington on Voyeur Lucy Davis on Barron McLain Ward on Azur Elizabeth Madden on Cortes 'C'  Christian Ahlmann on Taloubet Z Meredith Michaels-Beerbaum on Fibonacci Daniel Deusser on First Class Ludger Beerbaum on Casello } See also *Equestrian at the 2016 Summer Paralympics References External links  Results Book ‚Äì Equestrian 2016 Category:2016 Summer Olympics events Category:2016 in equestrian Category:Equestrian sports competitions in Brazil ","title":"Equestrian at the 2016 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"36721638","title":"Canoeing at the 2016 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"36721639","title":"Boxing at the 2016 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"36721641","text":"Microsteus is a genus of small selenosteid arthrodire placoderms known from the Upper Frasnian Kellwasserkalk facies of Late Devonian Germany.

M. angusticeps differs from the type species in having a head with an angular profile, and M. gracilis differs from the other two species by being somewhat narrower in cross-section. Denison (1978) suggests that M. angusticeps and M. gracilis do not have enough differences from M. dubius to merit separate species status, but other authors, such as R√ºcklin 2011, treat the three as separate species. M. angusticeps and M. gracilis originally composed the genus Parawalterosteus.

The game was released on the Sega Saturn, Sega Genesis, Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, DOS, and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game's cover features San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve Young passing while being tackled by Chicago Bears defensive linemen Chris Zorich and Albert Fontenot. The Saturn, SNES and DOS versions were developed by Iguana Entertainment, while the Game Boy edition was developed by Condor Inc. Gameplay The game has 32 offensive plays and 16 defensive plays. The simulation modes include Preseason, Playoffs and Season, where one plays a season of 18 games. Another playable mode is the Quarterback Challenge, where players take control of a quarterback and compete against other quarterbacks in the league in various competitions, such as distance, mobility, obstacle, and accuracy. Players can save their game via passcodes. As the game has the National Football League license, all 30 teams are represented in the game, and players can perform transactions between teams, as well as player substitutions. The game also features the no huddle offense, three camera angles, penalties, three possible clock speeds, weather conditions, player reports, replays, and pre-game shows. Reception The game received mixed to positive reviews. Reviewing the Genesis version, a critic for Next Generation commented that where the previous year's Quarterback Club had suffered from having no players' license or tracking of stats, Quarterback Club '96 fixed those problems and ranked alongside Madden NFL '96 and Prime Time NFL '96 as one of the best football simulators. He criticized the graphics but felt that the passing mechanics were better than in any other football video game, due to the ability to \\"actually drop back in the pocket and wait for an open receiver.\\" GamePros Slo Mo judged it a great game in most respects, citing the comprehensive stats, broad camera view, sharp sprites, voicing, Hyper Audibles feature, and \\"intelligently constructed\\" practice mode. However, he felt the weak opponent A.I. even at the highest difficulty level to be a crippling flaw which, while amusing in some respects, would turn off hardcore football gamers. He later reviewed the Super NES version, saying that it \\"essentially mirrors the Genesis game with a similarly offensive-minded A.I. but slightly slower player speed.\\" He again discussed the weak A.I. but was more forgiving of it this time, recommending that players use the competitive multiplayer mode. Next Generation reviewed the Genesis version of the game again, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Quarterback Club '96 is, in essence, your average football game. Not brilliant, not bad.\\" Reviewing the Saturn version, Rob Allsetter of Sega Saturn Magazine praised the multiple camera angles and the multi-player mode, criticized the miraculously perfect enemy teams in one- player mode, and concluded \\"while it sticks trenchantly to the familiar 16-bit formula, it is nevertheless an expansive and entertaining game.\\" Maximum commented that the graphics of the Saturn version are significantly improved from the \\"16-bit versions\\" and that the historic mode is very innovative. They concluded that \\"you can't deny that Acclaim have managed to include just about everything needed to make American football, well, American football. It also plays very smoothly too, and manages to be entertaining without being too fussy.\\" Johnny Ballgame of GamePro strongly objected to the game's depiction of professional football, commenting that \\"QB Club '96 has so many careless errors that its creators appear unfamiliar with football.\\" He further criticized the \\"jerky\\" player control and slowdown. He acknowledged that the gameplay is \\"decent\\" and has a large number of modes and features, but ultimately chose to not recommend the game. Johnny Ballgame also reviewed the never-released PlayStation version. He said it has cleaner graphics than the Saturn version and praised features such as the ability to switch quarterbacks between teams. However, he criticized the design and AI, and concluded, \\"Despite the decent features and graphics, QB Club lacks solid, addicting gameplay.\\" Allgame gave the Genesis version 3 stars out of 5, praising the Quarterback Challenge, but criticized the simulation modes, commenting that the graphics, design and point of view are very weak.

He was born in Bathurst, New South Wales. He joined the Australian Aboriginal cricket team on its tour to England in 1868. He was primarily a fast bowler, and a hard-hitting lower order batsman. His bowling was limited initially over concerns that his bowling action might be illegal, but taking advantage of the recent change in the Laws of Cricket to allow overarm bowling, he took 9/9 and 6/7 against an East Hampshire side at Southsea, and then 9/17 and 3/39 against a Hampshire team at Southampton. He played in 46 of the 47 matches on the tour, scoring 589 runs at an average of 8.29, and taking 35 wickets at an average of 6.9 from 704 balls bowled. Playing against a Sheffield team at Bramall Lane in August 1868, he hit the ball so far and high that the batsmen were able to run nine runs (with no overthrows). He played in a single first-class match for New South Wales against Victoria in February 1870, scoring 8 and 0, and taking 0/41 and 0/15.

Known for his parodies and sarcasm, he is one of the founders of the Dr√®ents literary magazine Roet, which sought to broaden the literary appeal of Dr√®ents writing by teasing it away from a focus on nostalgia and trodden paths.Martin Koster (ed.) (2004), Str√®upers van de taol: 25 jaor Roet, Zuidwolde: Het Drentse Boek Youth and employment as teacher Koster's family on his father's side had lived between the river Reest and the Dedemsvaart canal since the 19th century. His mother's family left the Kingdom of Hannover in the 19th century as asylum seekers, establishing themselves in Roswinkel in the province of Drenthe.Martin Koster (2010), Hotel an 't spoor, Beilen: Het Drentse Boek Koster himself grew up in the village of Dedemsvaart, in the house from which his parents ran a grocery shop. The first six years of his life, Koster spoke \\"nothing but the finest Dr√®ents there is: Riest or south west Dr√®ents\\".Rouke Broersma (ed.) (2003), Scheupers van de taol: bloemlezing van de Dr√®entse Schrieverij 1837-2003, Zuidwolde: Het Drentse Boek, p. 181 He attended higher secondary education in the provincial capital of Zwolle; at age eighteen he and his parents moved to nearby Hoogeveen in Drenthe. In 1970 Koster took up a study of Dutch at the University of Groningen, where he was qualified as a teacher of Dutch in secondary schools. The university's Low Saxon Institute, where his teachers included professor in Low Saxon Hendrik Entjes, instilled a fondness in him for regional language and dialect writing. Between 1976 and 1981, Koster was a teacher at Assen, Deventer and Stadskanaal. He was a guest teacher of Dr√®ents at the teachers' college in Meppel. He was a publican for a stint in Nee. In Leek in 2000, he took up a position teaching Dutch to non-native speakers.Rouke Broersma (ed.) (2003), Scheupers van de taol: bloemlezing van de Dr√®entse Schrieverij 1837-2003, Zuidwolde: Het Drentse Boek, p. 179Het Drentse Boek on Martin Koster (accessed 14 August 2012) He has also run a liquor store, been a public transport driver and worked as a shepherd.Martin Koster (2010), Hotel an 't spoor, Beilen: Het Drentse Boek Today he lives in Lieveren. Writing and teaching in Low Saxon Koster's poems and sketches, which have by and large appeared in Roet magazine, were published under a plethora of playful pen names, including the prominent one Meine Roswinkel. He has published under his own name since 1995. Themes in his work include death, loneliness, marginal figures, the precarious position of Low Saxon, and the difficult relationship between men and women.Stieneke Boerma and Rouke Broersma (1993), Dr√®entse schrieverij, Zuidwolde: Het Drentse Boek, p. 81-89 He has frequently parodied other Dr√®ents writers, such as Marga Kool, Roel Reijntjes and Peter van der Velde. Koster was a coordinator of teaching methods of several varieties of Dr√®ents and helped compile a Dr√®ents spelling and literature course for local radio station Radio Noord. Between 1986 and 1992 he was a columnist for the Drentse Courant and Dagblad van het Noorden. He also corrected and edited many Dr√®ents-language publications.Stieneke Boerma and Rouke Broersma (1993), Dr√®entse schrieverij, Zuidwolde: Het Drentse Boek, p. 84 With fellow Dr√®ents writer Anne Doornbos, Koster founded the 'Nei Dr√®ents Geneutschap' in 2005, a society which gives awards to people and organizations for doing the Dr√®ents language a good turn. Conversely, the society gives ironic awards to those who it believes have done the language a disservice. Founding of Roet In a pub in Groningen in 1979, Koster suggested creating a literary magazine in Dr√®ents. His fellow student, Ton Kolkman from Twente, was instantly enthused. That same day they wrote the first issue of Roet (Dr√®ents for garden weeds). From its improvised beginnings, the magazine went on to become one of the house publications of the Dr√®ents emancipation institute Huus van de Taol. It profiled itself as antagonistic towards stiflingly old-fashioned, unliterary writing. The time of siep, schaop en scheuper (sheep dog, sheep and shepherd), proclaimed the editors, was over.Martin Koster (ed.) (2004), Str√®upers van de taol: 25 jaor Roet, Zuidwolde: Het Drentse Boek Shortly before starting Roet, Koster had been an editor of De Pennevogel (appearing between 1974‚Äì1979) which, on a similar tack as its predecessor 't Swieniegeltje, had included work in several varieties of Low Saxon from the Netherlands and Germany. As distinct from the older Dr√®ents publication Oeze Volk, Roet published controversially themed pieces on subjects such as homosexuality, which was a first within the world of Dr√®ents writing. Initially publishing only Dr√®ents, it later adapted its policy and included work in Dutch and other languages as well. Koster was an editor of Roet for twenty years. In 2004 he published an anthology from 25 years of Roet entitled Str√®upers van de taol: 25 jaor Roet (Poachers of the language: 25 years of Roet).Het Drentse Boek on Martin Koster (accessed 14 August 2012) Koster and the Drentse Schrieverskring Koster was a member of the Drentse Schrieverskring, a society of Dr√®ents writers founded in 1953. He started to vent his opinion that the society included many members who were not interested in literature. Some members wanted to see him expelled on the basis of his writings, but under the patronage of the society's president Klaas Kleine he was appointed to the board in 1991. When discord arose in 1992 because a number of members did not want writer and politician Lukas Koops to become president, Koster supported Koops. Citing a ban placed on himself to talk critically about members, Koster subsequently left the Schrieverskring.Stieneke Boerma and Rouke Broersma (1993), Dr√®entse schrieverij, Zuidwolde: Het Drentse Boek, p. 73-74 Publications by and about Koster With the exception of his poetry and a memoir, Koster's work has mostly appeared as loose contributions. In 1995, Het Drentse Boek published his semi-autobiographical account Z√∂lfportret mit sparzegelties (Self-portrait with Spar savings coupons), vignettes largely of his childhood and student life. He made the first Dr√®ents translation of a comic, the Spike and Suzy album Het hondeparadies (The dog paradise), published in 1998.

It was first released on the iOS platform on January 12, 2012. The game was later released on Android on August 7, 2012. A port for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Mobile, titled Cytus: Lambda, was released on June 26, 2013. An arcade version titled Cytus: Omega in collaboration with Capcom was revealed at JAEPO in February 2015 and was set for location testing in July 2015, but was ultimately cancelled on March 30, 2018. A sequel game, Cytus II, was released on January 18, 2018 for iOS and March 2018 for Android. A remake Cytus Alpha (stylized as Cytus Œ±) was also released for the Nintendo Switch on April 25, 2019. Plot = Cytus = The story of Cytus is carried through its 10 main chapters as well as a prologue. The story revolves around the protagonist, Vanessa, who lives in a 22nd-century world where robots with human memories are the only remaining sentient beings while living humans are killed by a mutant virus. Due to limited memory space, human emotions are stored in the form of music in \\"Cytus\\", and by playing the songs, the robots are able to revive their human emotions. The plot features the disaster and the protagonist's struggle with identity. The story is told in-game through various cutscenes that are unique to the chapter title songs; individual songs within each chapter are at most only marginally relevant to the plot, except for a limited few. = Cytus II = Cytus II, the sequel to Cytus, takes place about seven hundred years after the establishment of the virtual Internet space Cytus (stylized as cyTus). As more and more people used virtual Internet, more and more musicians held concerts on iM, a social networking service. One musician, Aesir (stylized as √Üsir), decided to hold a large virtual concert in Node 08, one of the many nodes in Cytus. Attendees of the event included Paff (stylized as PAFF), a popular singer, Neko Asakura (stylized as NEKO#Œ¶œâŒ¶), a famous streamer on iM, and Robo Head (stylized as ROBO_Head), an AI robot. A bunch of top musicians performed, but the organizer, Aesir, was nowhere to be seen, even after the end of the event. By browsing through iM and through each character's private \\"OS logs\\", players can unlock new songs and gain insight into the story of Cytus. Later, Paff and her media company, Monophonic Entertainment, announced the date for her seventh annual event, PAFFCON. Tickets for her event sold out quickly. At the event, while Paff performed her encore song, \\"Gravity\\", she collapsed. Paff was sent to the hospital, where she would wake up a few days later and start recovering. While Paff was in the hospital, one of Neko's stream got hacked and attacked by Aesir. Neko was arrested by Node 08's Administration Bureau because she was suspected of launching the widespread attack on her fans. Meanwhile, Robo Head later discovers that their memory of Aesir was corrupted, and starts data recovery. People wanted to know who was responsible for the hacking. After Robo Head completes data recovery, he learns that Aesir did show up at the event and that they wiped everyone's memory of Aesir after they finished performing. Soon after, a new band, Crystal Punk (stylized as Crystal PuNK) created their new account and host their first major event. Paff was originally going to attend, but her health did not improve. Neko was acquitted a few weeks later by the Administration Bureau. Paff left the hospital and was reported missing by Monophonic Entertainment. Her real identity, Aroma White, was also released by the company. This sparked protests outside of Monophonic's headquarters regarding the location of Paff. The lead singer of Crystal Punk, Cherry, was inadvertently injured while entering the building's headquarters. Cherry was discharged from the hospital a few days later. One afternoon, while walking home from school, Neko encounters Paff outside of her home on a rainy day. Neko decides to take Paff in and protect her. Paff was missing for two weeks. Neko's fans and family members grew suspicious that she was hiding something. At the same time, Robo Head was analyzing memory files and eventually overwrote their \\"Supreme Command\\"--an order that they must follow, and heads back to the node where they were created, Node 03, to locate and find Nora. A few years earlier, Robo Head's supreme command was reprogrammed by Nora to prevent them from returning to Node 03 or Nora. Not long after, the entire iM system was being affected by a data corruption bug. Messages posted on iM would be scrambled with garbled text. Eventually, iM was attacked by Aesir, preventing anyone from logging in and scrambling messages so readers could not see them. The attack led to Xenon (real name: Simon Jackson) being arrested on charges of doing everything that Aesir did: delete memories and attack the virtual Internet. Xenon pleads no contest to these charges, and he is sent to prison. After Paff is located by her sister, Helena, Paff discovers that she has the memories of two people: Aroma White and Kaori Minamiya. Years earlier, her career started through a talent show at her school where the winner would sign a contract with an entertainment company. On the way to one of her events, she was seriously injured in a car accident. Aroma was sent to the hospital in critical condition. Noah, Helena's husband, was able to save Aroma by transplanting her memories into that of another body, Kaori. Through that, Paff could sing songs none of her family heard of, but she lacked the ability to remember before the car accident. Paff goes to Node 03 along with Neko and Hayato, a reporter, to learn more about her past. Unknown to the other characters, an Architect, or an intelligent AI robot that assisted with the reconstruction of human society, attacked Neko's stream and iM. Architects also have the ability to feel emotions that humans can feel. Ivy (serial number: OPCI_2501_IV) was attempting to wake another Architect, Vanessa (serial number: OPCI_2501_V), through the Cytus platform. Ivy woke up 500 years after \\"the decommission\\", or when Architect robots were deactivated after human society was recovered from the \\"ender virus\\". She needed to collect memories of Ivy and Vanessa in order to wake her up. Ivy finally woke Vanessa up through OS space, a space in Cytus where people can meet and interact; however, because of a video that another Architect, Ilka, showed her before the Decommission, Vanessa's core was corrupted, changing her from thinking about helping with humanity to finding a way to end humanity. Ivy wants to find a way to save Vanessa. After Ivy establishes contact with Vanessa, she encounters and captures Noah and asks him to transfer Vanessa's memories to that of an empty Architect unit to attempt to wake her up. Noah is unsuccessful and injured, and the empty unit is damaged beyond repair. As a safety measure, Ivy sets up a firewall in an attempt to prevent Vanessa from hacking or compromising any other Internet-connected devices. Meanwhile, two members of Crystal Punk, Cherry and ConneR, break Xenon out of jail. In Node 03, Paff and Neko encountered Robo Head and met Nora. Nora is the leader of Kyuu Hou Hai, one of many gangs that prevail in Node 03. Nora explained to Paff that she has the ability to see into OS space. Nora had used this ability before, but it left her vision trapped in OS space, leaving her unable to see in the real world without technology. At one point, when entering OS space, Paff encounters Vanessa and discovers her intent to eradicate humanity. Kyuu Hou Hai was attacked a few days later by drones. The group successfully fight off the drones, but Cherry gets shot in the process. These same drone attacks also destroyed Joe's cafe. Cherry was placed on life support in Kyuu Hou Hai. Nora guaranteed that she would recover successfully, however, the electricity at Kyuu Hou Hai blacks out. While backup power was able to reenergize lights and doors, the life support Cherry is on fails, and she dies. The band she created is disbanded as none of the other members knew how to sing well. After a successful investigation in Node 13, ConneR determined that Ivy was likely the culprit of the drone attacks. He, Nora, and the rest of the group return to Node 08 to stop the destruction of humanity. After encountering Ivy at A.R.C., a technology company, they learn that Vanessa is causing the chaos. Soon after, Vanessa hacks the weather system and reprograms it to extreme weather to spread a virus, triggering the end of humanity. Noah attempts to disrupt Vanessa's signals by sending an electric shock to damage the robots, electrocuting himself in the process. Ivy successfully goes into the Library at A.R.C. and successfully encountered Vanessa up following the advice of another Architect, Rin, to talk to her calmly to snap Vanessa out of the attitude of desiring to destroy humanity. Not long after, the A.R.C. Armed Forces find Ivy and kill her, forcing Paff, Neko, Nora, Xenon, ConneR, Robo Head, and the player into a final battle to inject a virus that they created earlier through OS space into Vanessa, ultimately killing her and restoring the peace that precedes. During the final battle, Paff calls out to the player for help sharing the burden of the virus in OS space. The story has three endings, depending on the player's choices in the final battle. If the player fails to kill Vanessa by tapping the last note on-screen, then Vanessa wipes out all of humanity. The characters on the menu screen gray out, and the places the characters reside in are empty and/or ruined. The only character the player can play is Vanessa, which forces the player back into the final battle. If the player fails to answer Paff's call for help by tapping the first note on screen, then Paff dies from the burden of transferring the virus and her memories to Vanessa. Vanessa comments that Paff's memories are beautiful right before she dies, and Paff's sister, Helena, is left to grieve. If the player shares the load of the virus by tapping the note that appears before the battle, then Vanessa is destroyed. Paff returns to singing and accepts her dual identity as Aroma and Kaori, and works on a collaboration with Neko. If Vanessa does not destroy humanity, then the player will find themselves awoken in a hospital three months later. A.R.C. decides to decommission the library and to improve transparency. Rin breaks out of A.R.C. and starts living a normal life, blending in with the crowd and hiding the fact that she is an Architect. Joe rebuilds his cafe that was destroyed in a drone attack, and Xenon's sister, Shannon, is successfully recovered from OS space. In a post-credits scene, Ivy can be seen damaged in OS space surrounded by a group of Architects.

Gameplay The main gameplay of Cytus features an Active Scan Line, a line that moves up and down across the screen. The player must tap circular objects, known as Notes, as the Active Scan Line passes over them, following the music. Different types of \\"notes\\" are used: *The Click Note, a single circular note, requires tapping the object in time. *The Drag Note, a continuous track of notes, requires dragging along the track. *The Hold Note, a note with an extended ribbon meter, requires the note to be held until the meter is filled. *Cytus II has an additional note, a Flick Note, which the player must flick to the left or right to hit. It also has a combination of a click note and a drag note.  This only appears in Chaos or Glitch difficulty levels. In Cytus, notes to be hit as the line rises are colored blue and purple, while those as the line falls are colored yellow and green. In Cytus II, notes to be hit as the scan line rises are colored green, purple, and dark pink, while notes to be hit as the scan line falls are colored blue, pink, and dark orange. As the judgement line speeds up, the line turns red, and as the line slows down, the line turns green. Each note provides a score based on its accuracy, which can be \\"Perfect\\", \\"Good\\", \\"Bad\\" or \\"Miss!\\". Hitting consecutive notes in a row with either a \\"Good\\" or \\"Perfect\\" rating will result in a combo, which provides a score boost that increases as the combo rises. At the end of a song, the player is given a score out of 1,000,000, with a minimum of 700,000 required to clear it. The player also receives a letter grade: \\"Fail\\" if a song isn't cleared, C at 700,000 points, B at 800,000 points, A at 900,000 points, S at 950,000 points, and Million Master at the maximum 1,000,000. As of version 2.0, there is a secondary scoring system, \\"Technical Points\\" or \\"TP\\". This introduced a new, stricter rating known as a \\"Rainbow Perfect\\" denoted by a rainbow outline on the disappearing note effect. TP is calculated purely on note accuracy and is given as a percentage. Each song has two difficulty levels--Easy and Hard, with a difficulty rating from 1 to 9. Cytus II has three to four difficultly levels-- Easy, Hard, Chaos, and Glitch--with difficulty ratings ranging from 1 to 16. The player may also choose how the notes fade in and toggle tap effects. = Notes = =Playable songs= Cytus includes 210 songs available for play in the game, spanning a variety of genres including pop music, trance music and drum and bass. The music is composed and performed by independent composers and artists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. Vocaloid engines are also used. A number of songs also has alternate version(s) in addition to the normal version. These can be called upon by interacting with the song artwork in the song selection screen. Gestures used include tapping, swiping and holding at a specific timing and location. Cytus also includes a series of songs in image of the overarching plot, collectively named Cytus: Alive, added in version 6.0 in July 2014. Unlike normal songs, Cytus: Alive songs contains added plot animation during gameplay. Releases and pricing Cytus is available through the Apple App Store and Google Play. The full game charges a base price plus optional in-app purchases for players to purchase additional chapters of playable songs. The release on Google Play is free but features a cooldown timer before starting each song. The cooldown is removed when the full price is paid. The PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Mobile port Cytus: Lambda includes the then-exclusive chapter Prologue: Live, otherwise identical to its smartphone releases. A teaser video was released onto YouTube prior to release on June 7, 2013. This version has since been made unavailable with the shutdown of Playstation Mobile. Cytus Œ±, a remake of the game for the Nintendo Switch, was released on April 25, 2019. This version, along with a revamped interface, added two new chapters, extra story elements, and an online Battle Score mode. =Million Downloads Plan= Rayark Games announced the Million Downloads Plan () in the wake of \\"illegal piracy harming the sales figures of Cytus\\". Starting from Version 2.0.0, a 10-song chapter would be made available to all players for free for each 100,000 paid downloads achieved, up to a million paid downloads or ten chapters. The plan is completed with Version 8.0, released in July 2015, opening ten chapters for free, including the special Chapter Million featuring remixes of past songs. Reception =Cytus= , Cytus ranks #7 in the iOS App Store's \\"Music\\" category in the United States. Smartphone game reviewer TouchArcade gave the game 4 stars out of 5, saying that \\"the gameplay is pretty simple, but well executed\\", though noting it lacked a health system and had fairly loose hit detection. =Cytus Œ±= Cytus Œ± received mostly positive reviews. Ryan Craddock of Nintendo Life gave the game a \\"great\\" 8 out of 10, praising the game's mechanics as \\"something particularly satisfying about dancing around the screen playing a musical version of whack-a-mole\\", but that its higher price compared to Rayark's other titles Deemo and Voez meant that \\"Rayark has almost shot itself in the foot with its previous releases.\\" Shigeta Yuichi from IGN Japan gave the game an 8.5 out of 10, noting the Battle Mode's low playerbase and inability to search for friends, yet one that he could still \\"wholeheartedly recommend to new players\\". Other media =Soundtrack= Multiple Cytus soundtracks have been released both on iTunes and as physical CDs, featuring playable music and background composition from the game. Cytus -Prologue-, was released on April 1, 2012, Cytus -Hindsight- on December 10, 2013 and Cytus -Foresight- on December 28, 2013. A story album called Cytus -Alive- has also been released on August 20, 2012; the album features songs composed by Sta and Cranky with the same names as the ten chapters of the game. Each song corresponds to each chapter in the story plot. The Cytus II soundtrack consists of music by indie composers from the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Notable collaborations in the game includes those with Hatsune Miku and Kizuna AI. =Code: Cytus= Code: Cytus () is a multimedia video game music stage production based on the story of Cytus, produced by Divertimento Media () as commissioned by Quanta Arts Foundation ().

He was a right handed fast bowler. Henry was born in Lowood, Queensland. The Australian Dictionary of Biography suggests that his parents may be from the Jagera or Jukambe people. In around 1900, he moved to live at the Deebing Creek Mission near Ipswich, and played cricket for the Deebing Creek Aboriginal cricket team and then for Bundamba. Tall and thin, and a quick runner, he was an effective fast bowler. He played in seven first-class matches for Queensland between March 1902 and April 1905, scoring 36 runs in 13 innings and taking 21 wickets at an average of 32.04. He made his first-class debut in the match between Queensland and New South Wales in Brisbane in March 1902. He is thought to have been the first person of Aboriginal descent to play first-class cricket for Queensland. His first match for Queensland became the subject of much media attention in Australia, because it was the first time that two Aboriginal Australians had played in opposing teams at first-class level, with the New South Wales team including Jack Marsh, another fast bowler who had been accused of throwing. Henry was reputedly the fastest bowler in the world. As part of the media promotion of the match-up between the pair, Henry was taken to Ipswich station to meet Marsh. Marsh was reported in the media as having said \\"Say old man, toss me up a soft one so I can get a smack at you\\". Marsh took 2/64 and 3/67 and Henry took 2/59 and 1/38 in a drawn match. Marsh and Henry each bowled three of their victims. They also dismissed one another once, each being bowled for nine in their respective team's first innings, and neither batted in their team's second innings, creating some symmetry in the scorecard. Nine was to remain Henry's highest first class batting score. Henry also played against Marsh in his second first-class match, between Queensland and New South Wales at Brisbane in November 1902. Henry scored 2 and 4 not out, and took 0/39 and 5/40, his best single-innings bowling return, but New South Wales won by 77 runs. Henry played against New South Wales at Sydney in December 1902, scoring 7 and 0 and taking 3/86 and 0/70 as New South Wales won by 2 wickets; against Victoria at Brisbane in January 1903, taking 3/76 and scoring 4 and 1 not out as Victoria won by an innings and 327 runs; and against the touring MCC side in November 1903, taking 2/60 ‚Äì the wickets of Len Braund and Ted Arnold ‚Äì and 0/21 and scoring 0 not out twice, as MCC won by 6 wickets. Braund was caught off the last ball of Henry's first over, and claimed it was the fastest bowling he had played against. He played in his last first-class matches against New South Wales, at Sydney in December 1903, taking 0/57 and 4/49 and scoring 0 and 0*, with New South Wales winning by 2 runs, and at Brisbane in April 1905, taking 1/78 and New South Wales winning by an innings and 12 runs. He moved to South Brisbane to play for a club team. After he was no-balled for throwing in a club match in 1904, he confronted the umpire Albert Crossart, saying that his good balls were no-balled, but the balls he threw deliberately were not. He was suspended and returned to Deebing Creek. After disagreements with the government authorities at Deebing, he was moved to Barambah (now Cherbourg) and then Yarrabah in northern Queensland, where he died of tuberculosis before his 30th birthday.

Prior to moving to Stony Brook, he was the Helen M. Ranney Professor, and Chair of the Department of Medicine at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. Early life and education Kaushansky was born on October 20, 1953 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. His father who \\"always wanted to be an American\\" migrated with the family to the United States, when Kaushansky was 2 years old. Kaushansky graduated from UCLA in 1975, summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a B.S. in biochemistry. He stayed at UCLA to obtain his medical degree in 1979. It was here that he met his future wife Lauren who was also at the time enrolled as a student at UCLA. As he left to join the University of Washington in Seattle to complete his internship and residency, Lauren enrolled for a Master's in Education at Antioch University in Seattle. Kaushansky was appointed Chief Resident at the Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, Washington in 1982. Describing himself as a \\"biochemist at heart\\", Kaushansky fell in love with hematology during his second year of residency. Curious about blood diseases and disorders, he chose to focus on the field during his fellowship between 1982 and 1986 at the University of Washington. His decision to pursue hematology was also influenced by the persuasive arguments of Dr. Clement Finch, the then Chief of Hematology at the University of Washington, who said \\"there is no other discipline in medicine where we know more about the biochemistry of disease than in hematology\\". In a Q&A; session with the American Society of Hematology, Dr. Kaushansky recalled: During his time in Seattle, he was honored with the NIH Physician Scientist Award in 1984, given to promising physician-scientists early in their careers. He was also awarded the junior faculty award by the American Cancer Society and was elected a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians. In 2002, Kaushansky was appointed as Chair and Helen M. Ranney Professor of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego. The Helen Ranney Chair in Medicine was the first research chair at the medical school named after a professor, the first endowed chair funded by the faculty, and the first endowed chair at UCSD named in honor of a woman professor. Helen Margaret Ranney was the first female president of Association of American Physicians, and her landmark research established one of the earliest links between genetic factors and sickle cell disease. On her demise in April 2010, Kaushansky (who had known her through his work in medical research) wrote in a moving tribute, \\"Helen's career was marked by her intelligent approach to both clinical and research issues, her ability to achieve and inspire greatness, and her incredible wit\\". Between 2003 and 2009, Kaushansky was named on the list of America's Top Doctors and San Diego's Top Doctors in Internal Medicine. In 2004, he was also elected a member to the prestigious Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Kaushansky is a past-president of the American Society of Hematology (2007-2008), the American Society for Clinical Investigation (2004‚Äì2005) and the Western Society for Clinical Investigation (1998‚Äì1999). He also served a 5-year term as Editor-in-Chief of the journal Blood (1998-2002) and as a major reviewer for the National Institutes of Health and many major scientific periodicals. Dr. Kaushansky has been recognized for his scientific and clinical contributions by election as a Master of the American College of Physicians, and to several honor societies and organizations, including the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the Association of American Physicians, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Work and research In July 2010, Kaushansky was named the Senior Vice President for Health Sciences and the Dean of Stony Brook Medicine. He succeeded Dr. Richard N. Fine who announced his intent to return to practicing pediatric nephrology in 2009. As Dean and Senior VP, Kaushansky oversees the education, clinical and research components of the School of Medicine and the Health Sciences, which include the School of Dental Medicine, School of Health Technology and Management, School of Nursing and the School of Social Welfare. He also has some oversight responsibility for Stony Brook University Medical Center, and oversight for the Long Island State Veterans Home. With 25 academic departments, 21 residency training programs and 27 fellowship training programs at Stony Brook Medicine, and as part of the only Academic Medical Center on Long Island, Dr. Kaushansky increased enrollment to help meet a growing need for physicians nationwide and welcomed 124 men and women to the class of 2012 ‚Äì the largest incoming class ever. Stony Brook Medicine is also home to a $4 million, 6,000 square-feet Clinical Skills Center, a state-of-the art training center where medical students evaluate and diagnose patients through teaching modules that incorporate the use of actor patients and computerized mannequins that simulate characteristic disease conditions. Kaushansky's appointment at Stony Brook was lauded by several academicians such as Eric W. Kaler the then Provost and Vice-President of Brookhaven Affairs at Stony Brook University and Dr. Edward J. Benz, the President of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and past president of the American Society of Hematology and the American Society for Clinical Investigation. Eugene Braunwald, M.D., Distinguished Hersey Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School described the decision to appoint Kaushansky at Stony Brook University School of Medicine as \\"brilliant\\". Kaushansky's lab at Stony Brook focuses on hematopoietic growth factors and the regulation of their gene expression. The lab also runs several projects to understand the physiology of megakaryotic developments and the tools necessary to perform gene therapy for bleeding disorders. Dr. Kaushansky has conducted seminal research on the molecular biology of blood cell production. As reported in journals such as Nature and The New England Journal of Medicine, his team has cloned several of the genes important in the growth and differentiation of blood cells, including thrombopoietin, a key regulator of stem cell and platelet production. Thrombopoietin is the powerful hormone that the body uses to direct the bone marrow to produce platelets, the disk-like cells that are necessary for blood to clot. In June 1994, the New York Times reported that Dr. Kaushansky along with a team from ZymoGenetics had found the mouse thrombopoietin gene, cloned it, produced recombinant hormone, demonstrated that it worked as expected in mice and then found the human hormone by looking for a human gene that resembled the mouse gene. In recent years his group has established that thrombopoietin exerts a profound influence on hematopoietic stem cells, affects the expression of a number of transcription factors that influence stem cell fate decisions (HOXB4, HOXA9, c-Myb, HIF1A) and has unraveled the pathobiology of several congenital disorders of thrombopoiesis. Kaushansky served as the Editor-in-chief of the medical journal Blood for 5 years between 1997 and 2002. Just before assuming this position, he was awarded the William Damashek Prize. William Damashek was the founder of Blood and a renowned hematologist. The Damashek Prize is awarded annually to someone less than 50 years of age, who is deemed to have made \\"outstanding contributions\\" to hematology. In 2006 and 2007, Kaushansky was elected as a member the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and honored as a Master of the American College of Physicians. He is also the former president of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the American Society of Hematology. Personal life Kaushansky is married to Lauren Elizabeth Kaushansky and together they have two children, Alexis and Joshua Kaushansky. Alexis is a PhD molecular biologist and Joshua is an economist for the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities based in Boston.

Myhre's work has been published in Upworthy, MSNBC, Racialicious, Feministing, The Progressive, City Pages, Artists of the Year list and URB magazine's \\"Next 1000\\" list. He has also appeared on Minnesota Public Radio. Much of Guante's music explores social justice issues such as poverty, greed and discrimination. Musical career Tran Myhre started in the performing arts using Guante (or El Guante) as a stage name in the early 2000s. Since the beginning of his performance career he has spoken out about sexism, racism, homophobia, and social justice issues through his spoken word poetry and hip hop. As a hip hop artist he has collaborated with Minneapolis locals Haley Bonar, Kristoff Krane and No Bird Sing, and is a member of the group Sifu Hotman with the rapper Dem Atlas and the producer Rube. Big Cats! produced his albums, An Unwelcome Guest and You Better Weaponize. Myhre founded the MN Activist Project. Tran Myhre describes his talents as a combination of spoken- word and hip hop. He says, \\"Most of the residency work I do revolves around spoken-word. For people who may not know, \\"spoken-word\\" is kind of an umbrella term for performance poetry‚Äîit incorporates elements of poetry, theater, storytelling and other forms.\\" He was Community Programs in the Arts artist of the month in April 2014. Activism and education Tran Myhre spends time teaching writing workshops and poetry seminars to young people with an emphasis on community. He is on the teaching roster at the Community Programs in the Arts (COMPAS), an organization that teaches people of all ages about various forms of art. Within the COMPAS program, he teaches poetry and spoken word to high school and middle school students. Tran Myhre describes his commitment and motivation to the COMPAS program. \\"It's really about access. I can play shows and sell CDs as Guante, but COMPAS facilitates my sharing my work with thousands of young people whom I would never have met otherwise. I like to think that they get something out of it, but I know that I get something out of it-- exposure to a new audience, the opportunity to spread this art form that I really believe in, the energy that comes from working with youth, and much more.\\" Tran Myhre is passionate about implementing arts into education. \\"Students who are engaged in the arts are more engaged in general. They become better critical thinkers. They enjoy life more. We have to think about education more holistically,\\" he says. \\"For all the practical applications of arts techniques, there are some incredibly important intangibles on the table as well. You can use hip hop to teach a kid math, but you can also use hip hop to save a kid's life. Learning about spoken-word is never just about writing poems; it's about critical thinking, leadership, civic engagement, identity formation, having an expressive outlet, and a million other things.\\" Discography ;Albums * Is This What It's Supposed to Be Like?

Rectangular, with pitched roofs, its pillars support wrought-iron ribs. Decimus Burton and Irish engineer, Richard Turner the designers, gave the House a mix of decorative motifs, finials, pediments, acanthus leaf capitals, Coade stone urns and statues. According to Greg Redwood, Kew's head of glasshouses, \\"The effect is similar to the contemporary iron pier pavilions of Eugenius Birch.\\" It was positioned to be the first feature visitors saw as they entered the gates with the anticipated coming of the first railway station at Kew expected to be at the end of the adjacent avenue. However, Kew Gardens rail station was built 500 yards to the north, leaving the glasshouse \\"somewhat stranded in the landscape\\".The Independent, Jack Watkins A cracking piece of design, 1 September 2011 Inside the temperate house In 2011 Kew launched a ¬£15m public appeal to address necessary repairs to the Temperate House. An early exercise in cast- and wrought-iron and glass construction, the building is structurally sound but the Victorians hid utilitarian features like drainpipes inside the stone columns. Water round the edge of the building led to rust on the iron to push against the masonry which was falling away. Decorative features made of wood were rotting. It last underwent a major restoration in the early 1980s. The building was restored during 2014‚Äì15 by Donald Insall Associates, based on their conservation management plan. There is a viewing gallery in the central section from which visitors are able to look down on that part of the collection. It was re-opened to the public in May 2018.

Dennison, Collector of the Port of New York William Loeb and law officer of the Bureau of Insular Affairs Felix Frankfurter future Supreme Court Justice. Chamberlain had been accused of incompetence in office. The commission determined on February 13, 1913 that Chamberlain was not an attorney and was not qualified to hold office.
