Biography  Franco Agostinelli was born on 1 January 1944 in Arezzo, a comune in Tuscany, Italy. He was ordained a priest on 9 June 1968 by Telesforo Giovanni Cioli, the Bishop of Arezzo, in the Parish of San Marco alla Sella after studying at the seminary of Arezzo. After graduating from the Pontifical Lateran University, where he received his licentiate in dogmatic theology in 1970, Agostinelli continued his studies at the Pontifical Alphonsian Academy, where he received a degree in moral theology in 1972. He first served in the Diocese of Arezzo as the vicar coadjutor of the cathedral and then as a parish priest of the Parish of the Sacred Heart. In 1984, he became the episcopal vicar for pastoral care and director of the catechetical office. He served as rector of the diocesan seminary from 1992 to 1994, and in 1997, he was appointed vicar general of the Diocese of Arezzo-Cortona-Sansepolcro and was confirmed in the position in 1999 by the new bishop, Gualtiero Bassetti. On 17 November 2001, Agostinelli was appointed the Bishop of Grosseto, and received his episcopal consecration from Pope John Paul II on 6 January 2002 in St. Peter's Basilica, with Cardinals Leonardo Sandri and Robert Sarah acting as co-consecrators. On 3 February 2002, he took possession of the Laurentian cathedra, officially taking charge of the diocese. During a pastoral visit launched in 2007, he came to the attention of the national Italian press. While visiting the quartiere of Barbanella in the city of Grosseto, he visited the local community of Arcigay. Agostinelli maintained that it was his practice to appraise himself of all Catholic and non-Catholic institutions within his diocese. Acrigay interpreted the visit as an endorsement of homosexual relationships by the bishop. At the meeting, Aurelio Mancuso, the national president of Arcigay, was present along with numerous journalists. Following attention by the media, Agostineli renounced the visit, saying that it had been exploited, and said that he would carry out another visit without any political or media interference. Agostinelli continued to demonstrate openness to dialogue with homosexual communities, meeting with other organizations over the years. On 29 September 2012, he was appointed the Bishop of Prato by Pope Benedict XVI and was installed in the diocese on 25 November 2013. Pope Francis accepted his resignation on 15 May 2019.

Main Library =Thomas Cooper Library= The Thomas Cooper Library is the University's main library. The facility opened in 1959 as a dedicated undergraduate library, the first such library in the South. The building was designed by Edward Durell Stone, the designer of the Kennedy Center, and the firm of Lyles, Bissett, Carlisle, and Wolff. The building was executed in a modernist design primarily of white marble. Taking its current form in 1976, the 289,000 sq ft facility houses the general collection on 45 miles of shelves. The library consists of seven levels, four underground and three above including a mezzanine level. In addition to housing books the library contains numerous study carrels, collaboration rooms, classrooms, and computer facilities. In the Technology Lounge students can check out tech devices such as laptops and tablets as well as access specialized software. The facility is open 24/7 to students. The library's general collection consists of items that have always been in the collection as well as items that were at one point housed in separate locations. For example, the science collection and the education collection were consolidated into the general collection from their original separate locations. The library is also home to government resources such as the Government and Maps collection which contains US federal government and European Union documents. In addition the Scholar Commons serves as an institutional repository of scholarly work. As the main research library the facility is home to numerous research resources such as journals, articles and databases, and hands-on guidance from librarians and research specialists. The library is host to multiple centers including: *Student Success Center *Center for Teaching Excellence *Digital Humanities Center *Career Center =Ernest F.

This facility is home to the Irvin Department of Rare Books & Special Collections as well as the South Carolina Political Collections. The Rare Books Collection ranges from works on philosophy, natural history, and literature among others. The collection contains the largest collection of Robert Burns and Scottish literature materials outside Scotland, and the largest Ernest Hemingway collection in the world. In addition there are also large collections relating to Joseph Heller, Dashiell Hammett, and William Faulkner. The Core Collection consists of the original books acquired by the university at the time of its founding, two items of note are an original copy of Diderot and D'Alembert's Encyclopedie, and 30 medieval incunabula, books printed in the first century of printing. Other Libraries =South Caroliniana Library= The South Caroliniana Library is located on the university's Historic Horseshoe. Begun in 1838 and completed in 1840, the Robert Mills-designed building was the first free standing college library in the country. Mills used the reading room of the Library of Congress that housed Thomas Jefferson's collection as the basis for his design. Historic photo of the South Caroliniana Library. The library served as the university's main library until 1940 with the completion of the, now, McKissick Museum. As one of the library system's special collections the library houses items relating to the state of South Carolina and the American South in general, items such as Civil War diaries, family papers, and the like. =Special Libraries and The Library Annex= The University Libraries also maintains special libraries at differing locations for subjects and schools including: *Business Library *Coleman Karesh Law Library *Moving Image Research Collections *Music Library *School of Medicine Library The Library Annex is located near the South Carolina state archives in northeast Columbia.

Biography =Origins and education= He was born into a poor family in Timi»ôoara, then part of the Austrian Empire. He was the second son of Vasile Ungureanu, a pandur from the Lower Alba area stationed in the Banat; and of Ana, who was of peasant origin. After completing the primary grades at the Romanian school in the Maiere district, he attended the city's gymnasium from 1819 to 1824 and proved a gifted student. After remaining an orphan, he received support from his older brother, who encouraged him to study philosophy at Szeged and Oradea. Attracted by medicine, he entered the University of Pest in 1827.Ploe»ôteanu, p. 94 At the time, the Hungarian capital was home to a number of activist Romanian students who promoted revolutionary Enlightenment notions. In this atmosphere, Vasici absorbed the science and culture of the day and began to strive for the uplift of his people. His first two publications were medical textbooks: Antropologia (1830) and Dietetica (1831). He completed university courses in 1831 and later that year had his first direct contact with the struggling peasantry, being sent to assist with a cholera epidemic in Maramure»ô. He took care of the sick for ten weeks, gaining prestige from the devotion he showed. =Career and revolutionary involvement= Vasici then returned to Pest, defending his thesis in August 1832. Titled Disertatio inauguralis medica de peste orientali, it dealt with epidemic typhus. Later that month, he returned to Timi»ôoara as a doctor in medicine, obstetrics and surgery, and began to practice medicine. His devotion to the poor led some to ask that he be named chief physician of the city, but he met opposition from certain members of the non-Romanian middle class. Thus, he sought to become head of the quarantine station in Jupalnic village in the Iron Gates area, and was hired in March 1834. Two years later, he was transferred to Timi»ô, in the Bra»ôov area.Ploe»ôteanu, pp. 94-5 He knew German, Hungarian, Serbian and Latin; Nicolae Iorga later imagined him as \\"a man with a poetic bent, an open mind able to group originally his wide knowledge from different areas, and also endowed with the gift and wish to write nice, delicate, flowery prose that his fellow Romanians could understand, and whom he wished to benefit\\". He assisted George Bari»õ in educating the Romanian peasantry, contributing regularly to Foaia pentru minte, inimƒÉ »ôi literaturƒÉ from the time it was founded; and to Gazeta Transilvaniei from 1843.Ploe»ôteanu, p. 95 Influenced by the intellectual ferment in Bra»ôov, where revolutionaries from the Danubian Principalities took refuge, he sought to strengthen links with these Romanian- speaking areas and advocated for national unity during the Transylvanian Revolution of 1848. He continued to publish in the two periodicals after the revolution was crushed, but was particularly active at the Sibiu-based Telegraful Rom√¢n. There, he was editor-in-chief from 1853 to 1856 and interim editor from 1861 to 1862. As adviser and later inspector of Romanian Orthodox schools, he made diligent efforts to improve Romanian-language education in Transylvania. =Politics and later years= Grave in Timi»ôoara He was a participant in provincial politics, taking part in a January 1861 congress that elected him to a leadership role. In 1863 to 1864, he was a prominent member at the Transylvanian Diet in Sibiu that approved equal rights for Romanians. In December 1865, together with 28 other leaders, he openly refused to recognize the right of the Cluj Diet to join Transylvania to Hungary proper, on the basis that the Unio Trium Nationum did not recognize the Romanian nation.Ploe»ôteanu, pp. 95-6 Living at Cluj from 1865 to 1869, Vasici was profoundly disappointed by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise approved during this period. He retired in May 1869 and returned to Timi»ôoara. Seeing that the political realm was largely closed to action, he dedicated the rest of his life to medical, hygienic and pedagogical education. In June 1879, he was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy. He left for Bucharest, capital of the Romanian Old Kingdom, and was overjoyed to at last set foot in independent Romania. He died two years later.Ploe»ôteanu, p. 96 Notes References *Grigore Ploe»ôteanu, \\"Un iluminist rom√¢n √Æn secolul al XIX- lea&,dash;Paul Vasici\\", in Studii, vol. 24, nr. 1/1971, pp. 93-114 Category:1806 births Category:1881 deaths Category:People from Timi»ôoara Category:Romanian Austro-Hungarians Category:E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University alumni Category:Titular members of the Romanian Academy Category:19th-century Romanian physicians Category:Romanian textbook writers Category:Romanian newspaper editors Category:Romanian revolutionaries Category:People of the Revolutions of 1848 ","title":"Pavel Vasici-Ungureanu"},{"id":"51788689","text":"Robot Wants Kitty is a 2011 action-adventure platform game developed by American indie developer Hamumu Software. It was adapted from an earlier Flash game of the same name. Plot The player character is a robot who must navigate a maze to rescue a kitten. Gameplay The player controls the robot as it navigates a series of six mazes, the goal in each being to reach the eponymous kitten. At the beginning of each level, the robot can do nothing but run left and right, but it will acquire additional abilities by obtaining items (called \\"apps\\") hidden throughout the maze, thus allowing it to backtrack and traverse previously-impassable obstacles. Once the robot reaches the kitten, the robot is stripped of all of its apps and sent to the next level, where the process begins again. Reception Robot Wants Kitty received positive reviews, currently sitting at 82/100 on Metacritic. TouchArcade gave it 4 stars out of 5, saying, \\"The way you acquire all of these abilities fits perfectly in to the Metroidvania formula ... it feel[s] like the essence of what makes said formula work so well has been practically perfectly distilled\\", though also added, \\"I suppose you could look at the fact that there's only six levels as a negative point of the game\\".

The majority of the African American population were forcibly abducted from their villages in West and Central Africa and brought to the American South via the Atlantic slave trade, with smaller portions of the population were voluntary immigrants from Caribbean, Latin American, and modern Sub-Saharan African nations. Population 125th Street in Harlem, an African and African American cultural center. According to the 2010 Census, New York City had the largest population of black residents of any U.S. city, with over 2 million within the city's boundaries, although this number has decreased since 2000. New York City had more black people than did the entire state of California until the 1980 Census. The black community consists of immigrants and their descendants from Africa and the Caribbean as well as native-born African-Americans. Many of the city's black residents live in Brooklyn and The Bronx. Several of the city's neighborhoods are historical birthplaces of urban black culture in America, among them the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant and Manhattan's Harlem and various sections of Eastern Queens and The Bronx. Bedford-Stuyvesant is considered to have the highest concentration of black residents in the United States. New York City has the largest population of black immigrants (at 686,814) and descendants of immigrants from the Caribbean (especially from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Guyana, Belize, Grenada, and Haiti), and of sub-Saharan Africans. In a news item of April 3, 2006, however, the New York Times noted that for the first time since the American Civil War, the recorded African American population was declining, because of emigration to other regions, a declining African American birthrate in New York, and decreased immigration of blacks from the Caribbean and Africa. In 2005, the median income among black households in Queens was almost $52,000 a year, surpassing that of white households. History =Slavery= =After abolition= Following the final abolition of slavery in New York in 1827, New York City emerged as one of the largest pre-Civil War metropolitan concentrations of free African- Americans, and many institutions were established to advance the community in the antebellum period. It was the site of the first African-American periodical journal, Freedom's Journal, which lasted for two years and renamed The Rights of All for a third year before fading to obsolescence; the newspaper served as both a powerful voice for the abolition lobby in the United States as well as a voice of information for the African population of New York City and other metropolitan areas. The African Dorcas Association was also established to provide educational and clothing aid to Black youth in the city. However, New York residents were less willing to give blacks equal voting rights. By the constitution of 1777, voting was restricted to free men who could satisfy certain property requirements for value of real estate. This property requirement disfranchised poor men among both blacks and whites. The reformed Constitution of 1821 conditioned suffrage for black men by maintaining the property requirement, which most could not meet, so effectively disfranchised them. The same constitution eliminated the property requirement for white men and expanded their franchise.\\"African American Voting Rights\\" , New York State Archives, accessed 11 February 2012 No women yet had the vote in New York. \\"As late as 1869, a majority of the state's voters cast ballots in favor of retaining property qualifications that kept New York's polls closed to many blacks. African-American men did not obtain equal voting rights in New York until ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870.\\" The emancipated African-Americans established communities in the New York City area, including Seneca Village in what is now Central Park of Manhattan and Sandy Ground on Staten Island, and Weeksville in Brooklyn. These communities were among the earliest. The city was a nerve center for the abolitionist movement in the United States. =After the Civil War= =Harlem and Great Migration= The violent rise of Jim Crow in the Deep and Upper South led to the mass migration of African Americans, including ex- slaves and their free-born children, from those regions to northern metropolitan areas, including New York City. Their mass arrival coincided with the transition of the center of African-American power and demography in the city from other districts of the city to Harlem. The tipping point occurred on June 15, 1904 when up-and-coming real estate entrepreneur Philip A. Payton, Jr. established the Afro-American Realty Company, which began to aggressively buy and lease houses in the ethnically-mixed but predominantly-white Harlem following the housing crashes of 1904 and 1905.

In addition, a number of tenements that had been occupied by blacks in the west 30s were destroyed at this time to make way for the construction of the original Penn Station. =Caribbean immigration= =The Great Depression and demographic shift= Harlem's decline as the center of the Afro-American population in New York City began with the onset of the Great Depression in 1929. In the early 1930s, 25% of Harlemites were out of work, and employment prospects for Harlemites stayed bad for decades. Employment among black New Yorkers fell as some traditionally black businesses, including domestic service and some types of manual labor, were taken over by other ethnic groups. Major industries left New York City altogether, especially after 1950. Several riots happened in this period, including in 1935 and 1943. Following the construction of the IND Fulton Street LineEchanove, Matias. \\"Bed-Stuy on the Move\\" . Master thesis. Urban Planning Program. Columbia University. Urbanology.org. 2003. in 1936, African Americans left an overcrowded Harlem for greater housing availability in Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant. Immigrants from the American South and the Caribbean brought the neighborhood's black population to around 30,000, making it the second largest Black community in the city at the time. During World War II, the Brooklyn Navy Yard attracted many blacks to the neighborhood as an opportunity for employment, while the relatively prosperous war economy enabled many of the resident Jews and Italians to move to Queens and Long Island. By 1950, the number of blacks in Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant had risen to 155,000, comprising about 55 percent of the population of Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant. In the 1950s, real estate agents and speculators employed blockbusting to turn a profit. As a result, formerly middle class white homes were being turned over to poorer black families. By 1960, eighty-five percent of the population was black.

She appears in Steven Quale's Final Destination 5 as one of the survivors of the North Bay bridge collapse. She is portrayed by Jacqueline MacInnes Wood and serves as one of the protagonists of the film. The character has gained a large amount of popularity and acclaim, mostly due to Wood's performance and the character's sassy and comedic personality.  Appearance  = Final Destination 5 = Olivia is an office worker at Presage Paper. She is on her way to a corporate retreat alongside her co- workers when Sam Lawton has a premonition that the bridge they are crossing will collapse; Olivia would have survived her fall into the river before a car falls and crushes her. She eventually gets off the bus and witnesses the bridge collapse moments later realizing that Sam's premonition was real. A few days later, Olivia meets with the others in their offices, drinking to the memory of the dead, but also seeming nonplussed by the recent death of another survivor, Candice Hopper in a gymnastics accident. Olivia then leaves for a LASIK appointment to improve her myopic vision. Her head is secured and her right eyelid pried open with a speculum. Out of anxiousness, she squeezes a teddy bear, popping off its eye onto the floor. The doctor realizes that he is missing file information and leaves Olivia by herself to talk to his secretary. A cup of water that Olivia left on top of a water cooler is knocked over when the cooler bubbles, and the cup spills onto the power unit of the laser machine plugged into the wall. The intensity of the ray is increased to extreme levels, and the laser machine starts to shake which causes Olivia to become nervous. Olivia reaches for the emergency stop button on the control remote to turn off the machine, but she accidentally knocks it to the floor, where the activation button is pressed, launching the laser that burns her eye and subsequently her hand. When Sam Lawton and Molly Harper rush into the front office to save her from danger, and as the doctor assures she'll be fine, her screams are heard and they hurry to save her. Just as they arrive in the room, she manages to release her head from the clamp and get off the table before the laser fires again. However, being in high heel boots, she trips over the glass teddy bear's eye on the floor and stumbles out the window, falling to her death.  Development  Jacqueline MacInnes Wood was cast as Olivia. = Casting = In an interview, Jacqueline MacInnes Wood revealed that she has been a fan of the series since she was a kid and talked about getting her part in the film and shooting her infamous death scene.

You keep numbing the eye, but after a while.... That fear, everything - that's real. That's exactly how I was feeling. There were times when I was trying to get to an emotional place - I was in a head vise, too - and the thing popped out of my eye. I didn't have any scrapes, maybe just one little tiny one, but I could handle it.\\" =Characterization= When asked to describe her character, Jacqueline said, \\"She is a straight shooter, a girl you want to know. She is very honest, perhaps a little too honest sometimes. However, she doesn‚Äôt say to thing to intentionally hurt anyone. She just doesn‚Äôt have a filter. She walks the talk, and is the kind of gal every man and woman would want as their BFF. She looks at life like a front line soldier: she would rather fight to the death, rather than hide in a hole.\\"  Reception  The character has been generally well received with many critics praising Jacqueline's performance. James Wood gave Jacqueline's performance a positive review saying: :\\"The supporting cast in this one are the best, I really liked Jacqueline McInnes Wood, her performance is witty and sexy and at times quite funny, her character says some insensitive things at the most inappropriate of times!\\" Irving Zarate called Olivia's death scene memorable saying: :\\"This death calls for little logic, but it is still effective. Anyone who saw this installment will not be getting an eye laser surgery any time soon. Vision is an important aspect of life, but when it comes to giving that up for a chance at sight then glasses don't seem so bad after all. Ultimately Olivia dies from falling out of a window, but it's the eerie sounds of the laser and its tragic aftermath that renders this scene unforgettable.\\"  References   External links  * Olivia Castle on IMDb Category:Film characters introduced in 2011 Category:Fictional characters from New York (state) Category:Fictional secretaries Category:Final Destination characters Category:Female horror film characters ","title":"Olivia Castle"},{"id":"51788794","text":"Siphanta is a genus of plant-feeding insect in the family Flatidae.

Produced by the Gay TV Collective at the facilities of Maclean-Hunter, the series was a news and information program targeted at LGBT audiences.\\"TV series on the air\\". The Body Politic, October 1, 1977. Although produced by Maclean-Hunter, the series also aired on the Rogers Cable and Metro Cable systems. The program premiered on September 19, 1977. It consisted of a news segment produced in conjunction with the staff of The Body Politic, interviews and discussion segments, entertainment by gay musicians and comedians, and a community events calendar. Known members of the programming collective included host Gordon Montador\\"Gay news re-scheduled after TV viewers complain\\". Toronto Star, September 23, 1977. and producer Frank Hutchings.\\"Maclean-Hunter cancels Gay T.V.\\". The Body Politic, June 1, 1978. Controversies The program's first episode aired at 6 p.m., although in subsequent weeks it was rescheduled to air at 10 p.m. due to viewer complaints. Two days after the first episode, Rogers backed out of airing the show on the grounds of the complaints.\\"Rights of access ‚Äî Cable, FM and the dailies: one foot in the door, two doors in the face\\". The Body Politic, November 1, 1977. Rogers claimed that they already had their own separate LGBT-oriented show in development, and that they were concerned about the CRTC making an issue of the service airing a program produced by another cable company. Due to pressure from the LGBT community, including support from the collective producing a similar show in Ottawa, the company reinstated the program three weeks later. It was eventually revealed that there were fewer than 20 actual complaints about the first episode. The show was also subject to efforts by Maclean-Hunter to impose a special code of conduct, a practice it did not follow with any other show being produced for the company. The code would have banned \\"propagandizing\\" or \\"recruiting\\" for gay organizations, would have restricted the show to content that was \\"educational and informative\\", and would have required in the name of \\"balance\\" that at least one person \\"not identified with the gay community\\" had to appear on each episode. The code was not adopted, although Maclean-Hunter retained the right to pre-screen content that might involve \\"controversial or unusual material\\". Cancellation The program was cancelled by Maclean-Hunter on May 26, 1978. In his statement announcing the cancellation, Maclean-Hunter executive John Haynes described the program as \\"offensive\\", as \\"intellectually hostile\\", and as \\"disrespectful to the establishment heterosexual community\\". He falsely claimed that the program had shown a photo of two men kissing in the nude, when in fact the men in the photo were fully clothed and attending a Gay Alliance Toward Equality dance. A spokesman for Metro Cable issued a statement indicating that company had no issues with the program's content. Following its cancellation, a radio program of the same title debuted on CKMS-FM in Waterloo as Canada's first known LGBT-oriented radio program.\\"Gays take to the air (waves, that is).\\" The Body Politic, September 1, 1978.

Republicans were less united by a single ideology, than a wide alliance of former Liberals and some Conservative elites who usually had some personal conflicts with the ruling Liberals and wanted to gain power for themselves. Soon after the coup, Republicans split in two new parties grouped around two leaders - Bautista Saavedra with his Republican Socialist Party and Daniel Salamanca, who established the Genuine Republican Party. Saavedra legalized the right to strike and introduced government arbitration in labour disputes. In 1922 he caused a general strike after banning night taxis. The strikers won and taxi services were resumed and railroad federation was recognized as representative of railroad workers. This did not mean the end of violence. In 1923 a strike by miners in Uncia was repressed by force. A native uprising in the Altiplano region led by Jesus de Machacha was also suppressed in the same year. The tin boom came to end in 1925 and economic problems began. Saavedra picked his successor Hernando Siles Reyes, one of the leading Republicans, who was elected President in 1926 and was forced to resign in 1930 after he tried to get elected for the second term. Daniel Salamanca then assumed Presidency with the help of Liberal Party and soon led the country into the disastrous Chaco War.

It was founded in 1951 by Jacob Chandy, Balasubramaniam Ramamurthi, S. T. Narasimhan, and Baldev Singh, who together have been credited to be pioneers in development of epilepsy surgery in India. The society appointed Jacob Chandy as its first President. The society publishes the bi-monthly journal Neurology India.  History and works  Neurosurgeon Jacob Chandy and neurologist Baldev Singh were associated with Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore and physicianelectrophysiologist S. T. Narasimhan and neurosurgeon Balasubramaniam Ramamurthi were from Madras Medical College & Hospital. They together founded the society in 1951 and had its first meeting in March 1952 at Hyderabad and published its own journal dedicated to the neurosciences titled Indian JournalNeurology. There being another journal by the same name, the society decided to rename their journal to Neurology India in 1953. Since its inception, the society held its annual meetings with the Association of Physicians of India but starting next year, it established its own annual conference and created its sub-sections of Neurology, Neurosurgery, Neuropathology and Neuroradiology in the Society. On 25 October 1969, the society registered itself with the Charity Commissioner, Public Trusts Registration Office, Greater Bombay Region (No. F-1819 (B)). In 1972, the society formed a sub-committee for standardization of Postgraduate Education. In 1977, the society became the first medical professional society in the country to conduct the continuing medical education by providing \\"updates on selected topics and encouraging interdisciplinary interaction among trainees in the various branches of the Neurological Sciences\\". In 1979, NSI founded a new association, the Satellite Conference of Neuro-nurses of India, as its branch held with the main objective to \\"set high standards of neuro-nursing in the country\\". The conferences of the association are conducted annually along with the annual conference of NSI. In 1977, the society formed four Working Groups to deal with Medical Education and Training, Research priorities, Manpower requirements and development of Services, Community Programme, and Instrumentation along with two new sub- sections, Neurophysiology and Electroencephalography. In 1979, the Association of Neurological Nurses as another sub-section was formed and named as \\"Society of Indian Neurosciences Nurses (SINN)\\". The society formed a sub-section of Neurophysiological Technologists in 1988 and named as \\"Association of Neurophysiological Technologists of India (ANTI)\\". The society instituted the \\"Dr. Jacob Chandy Oration\\" in 1969 and the \\"Dr. B. Ramamurthi Oration\\" in 1974, both to be held every two years along with the \\"Dr. R.G. Ginde Oration\\" in 1988, the \\"Dr. Baldev Singh Oration\\" in 1994, and the \\"Dr. Tandon Oration\\" in 1998 which are to be held every three years. Only two orations are organized during the annual conference each year and the orators are selected by the incumbent and immediate two past Presidents of the society. The society has five subspeciality societies associated with it which includes the Indian Society for Paediatric Neurosurgery, the Indian Society for Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery, the Skull Base Surgery Society, the Neurotraumatology Society of India, and the Cerebrovascular Society of India. The Neurological Society of India is affiliated to the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies, the Asian Australasian Society of Neurological Surgeons the World Federation of Neurology, the International Society of Neuropathology, the International Federation of Societies for Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology and there are two associations affiliated to the NSI, the Association of Neurological Nurses and the Association of Neurophysiological Technologists. The society has over 2000 members and has been involved in organising seminars and conferences to initiate interaction among practicing neurologists. In 2014, the society launched an awareness campaign called \\"Heads.. We Win\\" to encourage wearing of helmets, the lack of which causes major head injuries.  Lifetime Achievement Awardees  In 2008, the society instituted a Lifetime Achievement Award and following 21 recipients have been awarded; S. N. Bhagwati, H. M.

It will host cross-country skiing and nordic combined for the 2026 Winter Olympics. History The project to create a cross-country ski center was born in the mid-1980s, when the Val di Fiemme was a candidate to host the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships. At the 1988 Istanbul convention the FIS International Committee decided to set the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1991 at Val di Fiemme. The area of Lago di T√©sero was chosen since it is located in the center of the Fiemme Valley, easily accessible (a new road in the bottom of the valley was realized on the occasion of the 1991 World Championship) and easily innevable in case of adverse weather conditions and lack of natural snow (the stadium is located near the left bank of the river Avisio, from which they can take the necessary water for the artificial snow). After the success of both the 1991 and 2003, the stadium was renovated in 2010, in order to host again the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2013: they carried out many projects, including the construction of a new building that houses the commentary boxes and a 2000 m¬≤ warehouse, and extending the press room area. They also created a shooting range for the biathlon events at the 2013 Winter Universiade hosted here. The tracks have been enlarged (with a minimum of 9 meters), it was made a climb after the start, while runways and tunnels were created for the audience. Features Marcialonga 2011: Jerry Ahrlin followed by Oskar Sv√§rd passing through the Lago di Tesero Cross Country Stadium The cross country stadium regularly hosts cross-country ski events. The ski center is open between December and mid March and, thanks to the lighting system, it is possible to ski also in the evening until 9 p.m. In case of snow lack, it's possible to ski at Lavaz√® Pass cross country center at the altitude of MSL. The venue hosted the cross-country ski events of three editions of FIS Nordic World Ski Championships (1991, 2003, and 2013), the 2013 Winter Universiade, and many events of the FIS Cross-Country World Cup. Every year hosts the Mickey Mouse Trophy of Cross-country ski (Trofeo Topolino di sci di fondo), and the Marcialonga passes through. The buildings are all lined with Val di Fiemme wood and equipped with ISO 14001 environmental certification. The cost of stadium construction was funded at 95% by the Autonomous Province of Trento and the remaining 5% by the municipality of T√©sero. The cross-country stadium maximum capacity is about 50,000 spectators. Tracks Skiers passing through the stadium during Marcialonga 2011 The venue, located at the altitude of mean sea level, opens in winter season. There are 19 km of tracks, mostly with guaranteed artificial snow, from December to February, and it is linked with the Marcialonga track. The 3 km ring track is lit at night.

HsTx1 is a very potent inhibitor of the rat Kv1.3 voltage-gated potassium channel.  Etymology  HsTx1 stands for Heterometrus spinifer Toxin 1. The systematic name for this toxin is Œ±-KTx 6.3.https://www.uniprot.org/docs/scorpktx.txt  Sources  HsTx1 is produced by Heterometrus spinifer, also known as Asia Giant Forest Scorpion or Malaysian Black Scorpion. *Taxon Identifier: 118530  Structure  HsTx1 is characterized by a single polypeptide chain of 34 amino acid residues containing 8 Cysteine residues and an amidated C-Terminal end. Its core has a hydrophobic structure and the backbone displays one Œ±-helix and two Œ≤-sheets regions that connect the N-terminal and the C-terminal ends. The entire structure is cross-linked by 4 disulfide bridges. Scorpion toxins characterized that block voltage-gated potassium channels, have a highly conserved triplet of amino acids in the positions 23, 25 and 26 that is believed to have a role in the affinity for the channels. There are also two highly conserved amino acid residues (one positively charged and the other an aromatic residue) considered critical for the binding to specific Œ±-subunits of the potassium channel depending on their position in the sequence. HsTx1 has the triplet in its sequence but does not show homology in the doublet sequence, hinting that it might be able to bind to different subunits in the channel. = Homology and categories = Scorpion venom usually contains different toxins that could influence the physiological functioning of nervous system binding the sites and blocking the activity of voltage-gated ion channels. The main targets of these toxins are potassium channels and sodium channels. On the basis of their amino acid sequences comparison those toxins are classified in 4 groups(3). HsTx1 Toxin belongs to the fourth group, which also contains toxins Pi1, Pi2 and Pi3 (from Pandinus imperator scorpion) and Maurotoxin (MTX, from Scorpio maurus scorpion). Main structural characteristics are the presence of 34 amino acid residues and 3 or 4 Disulfide bridges. Toxins of the fourth group have 50%-70% sequence identity overlap with each other. In general the sequence of HsTx1 has only the 32-47% affinity with that of the toxins belonging to the three disulfide bridges group. Despite that their 3D backbone structures are similar. Within the 4 bridge groups, there is more structural homology between Pi1 and MTX than with HsTx1, since HsTx1 does not share the same position of cysteine residues responsible for the sulfide bonds in its sequence. These differences in homology could explain the differences in pharmacological activity such as HsTx1 binding with more affinity and specificity to the Kv1.3.  Target and mode of action  HsTx1 is one of the most effective peptidic inhibitors of Kv1.3 channels with an IC50 of 12 pM. Unlike other toxins from the same family HsTx1 does not seem to affect the apamin-sensitive calcium-dependent potassium channel. The affinity and interaction with the potassium channel is thought to depend both on the amino acid sequence of the toxin and the modification of its C-terminal end. It has been found that the amidated form might have a role in the higher affinity for the potassium channel. Positively charged residues of the toxin interact with negatively charged residues in the channel by electrostatic and Van der Waals forces. The toxin induces a reversible blocking effect by the formation of two salt bridges and six hydrogen bonds in the mouth of the pore of the channel. The five critical residues thought to interact with the channel are Y26, K29, M31, N32, R39.  Research  Because peptide toxins usually have high affinity for their targets, the small dosage needed to see effects makes them good candidates for therapies that aim to specifically and efficiently block voltage-gated ion channels. The aim now is to overcome the affinity range that usually involves more than one type of channel so that the effects can be specifically targeted and there are no side-effects. Kv1.3 channels are up-regulated in activated T effector memory cells in humans. Study of Kv1.3 blockers such as HsTx1 could lead to new treatments to autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes.

They are generated by natural disturbances such as wildfire or insect outbreaks that reset ecological succession processes and follow a pathway that is influenced by biological legacies (e.g., large live trees and snags, downed logs, seed banks, resprout tissue, fungi, and other live and dead biomass) that were not removed during the initial disturbance. Complex early seral forests develop with rich biodiversity because the remaining biomass provides resources to many life forms and because of habitat heterogeneity provided by the disturbances that generated them. In this and other ways, complex early seral forests differ from simplified early successional forests created by logging. Complex early seral forest habitat is threatened from fire suppression, thinning, and post-fire or post-insect outbreak logging. Complex early seral forest in boreal forest 1, 2, and 3 years post fire  Ecology  Complex early seral forests are structurally more complex, contain more large trees and snags, and have more diverse understories, more functional ecosystem processes, and more diverse gene pools than areas of timber harvest. These characteristics provide greater resilience in the face of climate change than that provided by the simplified early seral forests produced by logging. Complex early seral forest attributes promote a high level of species richness, particularly bird communities that utilize these forests extensively. The residual biomass of snags reduces disturbance stress and provides for the rapid proliferation of new life For example, seed banks and live vegetation tissue gives rise to dense forb cover, abundant grasses, and shrubs ‚Äì especially nitrogen fixers (e.g., Ceanothus spp.) and ectomycorrhizal associates (e.g., Manzanita spp.) that facilitate conifer growth. Closed cone conifers like giant sequoia also do well in these forests. Other plants that can abundantly colonize burns, such as conifers and fireweed, arrive by wind or animal dispersed seed. Plant species richness of snag forests can be much higher than in unburned forests. Bird and small mammal communities that utilize complex early seral forests forage on the abundant insects and increased abundance of seeds in the post-fire flora. These species, in turn, support an increase in raptors. Bird species such as the Black-backed Woodpecker, Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides), Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina), and Mountain Quail (Oreortyx pictus) achieve highest abundances in complex early seral forests. Bats (Myotis, Idionycteris, Lasionycteris, and Eptesicus) also use complex early seral forests because of greater insect prey as well as suitable roosts. Stand-replacing fires stimulate an increased flow of aquatic prey to terrestrial habitats, driving increases in riparian consumers. The trees killed by fire are beneficial to the ecological integrity of stream communities because they are a main source of large woody debris inputs. There is also reproduction by some forest fungi species that are restricted to burns (e.g., morels, Morchella spp.) and the dead wood provides substrate for fungal growth that supports many arthropod species, including unique fire-following native beetles. Beetles, in general, colonize fire-killed trees in complex early seral forests and their abundant larvae support species like Black- backed Woodpeckers Forest and Spotted Owl management documents often state that severe wildfire is a cause of recent declines in populations of spotted owls poses a primary threat to Spotted Owl population viability, but a systematic review and meta-analysis found fires created more benefits than costs for spotted owls.

Aiichir≈ç Fujiyama's business conglomerate planned to build a luxury apartment complex on the site after the war, but the award of the 1964 Summer Olympics to Tokyo led to a \\"hotel boom\\" in the city. The site was re-purposed for the Hotel New Japan, one of the first modern hotels in Tokyo, which opened in 1960 and became a center of political, social and media activity in Tokyo during the 1960s and 1970s. The hotel was severely damaged in February 1982 after a guest smoking in bed started a fire, which spread quickly due to a combination of inadequate safety equipment and inadequate staff response, killing 33 people. The Tokyo metropolitan government ordered the hotel closed shortly thereafter, although the hotel's basement nightclub, New Latin Quarter, remained operational through 1989. There are urban legends that the Prudential Tower is haunted by ghosts as a result of the disaster.

The Habsburg forces consisted of the I Corps of the Imperial Army led by Lieutenant Field Marshal Josip Jelaƒçiƒá. The Hungarians deployed I and III Corps led by General Gy√∂rgy Klapka and General J√°nos Damjanich respectively. The Hungarians were victorious, and thanks to this, the main Hungarian armies advanced towards the Hungarian capitals (Buda and Pest), forcing the Austrian high commander, Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr√§tz fight a decisive battle at Isaszeg, which would decide the fate of Central and Western Hungary until the intervention of the Russian forces on the Habsburg side in June 1849. Background After the Hungarian Revolutionary Army‚Äôs Spring Campaign started well with a victory at the Battle of Hatvan, the Second Army, consisting of I, II and III Corps, started to advance southwest in the direction of Pest and Buda. They met at J√°szber√©ny on 3April. General Art√∫r G√∂rgei, the interim commander-in-chief of the Hungarian armies, issued marching orders. Gy√∂rgy Klapka was to depart with I Corps at 4 the next morning towards T√°pi√≥bicske via Nagyk√°ta. J√°nos Damjanich with III Corps was to set off at 5am Nagyk√°ta.Lieutenant-Colonel Istv√°n Szekulits, with II Corps, was to move off at 6am towards Farmos. The army headquarters was to be at Nagyk√°ta.. The Hungarian plan for the Spring Campaign, as elaborated by Antal Vetter, was that VII Corps, commanded by Andr√°s G√°sp√°r, had to attract the attention of the Austrian Windisch-Gr√§tz by making a feint attack from the direction of Hatvan. Meanwhile the other three corps (I, II and III) would encircle the Austrian forces from the south-west, and cut them off from Pest and Buda.. It was important that these three corps should not be detected by the Austrians as they advanced towards Windisch- Gr√§tz.. Prelude Klapka‚Äôs troops finally departed two hours late, at 6 o'clock. On the way he received news that Jelaƒçiƒá's troops had spent the night at T√°pi√≥bicske but departed, leaving only their baggage and a few soldiers in the village. So, without thinking about the danger of revealing the campaign plan to the enemy, Klapka decided to fall on them by surprise and take this apparently easy booty. But in the meanwhile, without Klapka's knowledge, Colonel Leopold Sternberg had arrived in T√°pi√≥bicske with his cavalry brigade, as had an infantry brigade under the command of Major-General Daniel Rastiƒá.. Battle Klapka's force was led by the Dipold brigade in the vanguard, followed by the rest of the army in this order: the Bobich, Sulcz and Z√°k√≥ brigades (named after the officers who led them), then the cavalry division led by Colonel Arisztid Dessewffy. The vanguard crossed the T√°pi√≥ river, then entered T√°pi√≥bicske in company columns. But here it was caught by surprise by the crossfire of the Croatian border guard units of the Rastiƒá-brigade, hidden among the houses of the village, and suffered heavy losses, retreating in disorder towards the T√°pi√≥ bridge. The soldiers of the fleeing Dipold-brigade ran into the Bobich-brigade which had just crossed the river and deployed its horse battery. Their infectious panic routed Bobich‚Äôs infantry and artillery as well, then also the Sulcz and Z√°k√≥ brigades.. Portrait of Gy√∂rgy Klapka This predisposition to panic was a common problem in the Hungarian revolutionary army because, especially in the first months of the Hungarian War of Independence, they often used irregulars alongside the regular soldiers. The panicking irregulars caused major problems, for example in the Battle of Schwechat..) This was due to the poor quality of their training, or the short period of their instruction, caused by the urgent need for new troops to replace losses and the pressures of defending a country attacked from every direction, and the unpreparedness and lack of training of the officers; all of these down to the fact that the Hungarian army was only a few months old, while its enemy, the Habsburg army was the product of many centuries of uninterrupted institutional tradition... Than M√≥r: Cavalry fight in the battle of T√°pi√≥bicske with the duel of Alajos Seb≈ë and Hermann Riedesel The Hungarians also lost an entire battery because the gunners confused the attacking enemy infantry with theirs, due to them having the same colour uniforms. Seeing all these misfortunes, Klapka sent the I. (Cs√°sz√°r) and VIIIth (Koburg) hussar regiments to attack the Croatian Ban's Hussars, who were pursuing the Hungarian infantry. At the head of the I. Hussar Regiment was Major Alajos Seb≈ë, a very good officer, while at the head of the Croats was Major Hermann Riedesel, a strapping man, one of the best duelists in the imperial army. The two men knew each other. Riedesel challenged Seb≈ë to a duel, and this he accepted, despite fearing that he would certainly be killed, as he said later, to set a courageous example for his regiment, which was known as one of the weakest in the Hungarian army. After they had charged each other twice, neither of them was wounded, but on the third charge, after Riedesel had injured his hand or arm, Seb≈ë made his smaller and quicker horse push the Austrian officer‚Äôs horse, causing him to lose his balance, then struck him down with his sword, slashing Riedesel's face, who fell down dead.. Twenty years later this duel inspired the great Hungarian novelist, M√≥r J√≥kai, in his description of the duel between two of his fictional characters, the Hungarian hussar Rich√°rd Baradlay and the Austrian officer Otto Palvicz in the 23rd chapter of his novel The Baron's Sons (A k≈ësz√≠v≈± ember fiai), depicting the Battle of Isaszeg. K√°roly F√∂ldv√°ry as a soldier of the Hungarian Legion fighting in the Italian War for Unification. Foto: 1863 After Seb≈ë's success, the Hungarian hussars drove the Croat cavalry back, but were halted by the imperial artillery and a brave attack by the Croat border guard battalion, which forced them to retreat to the other side of the T√°pi√≥ river. This again caused chaos among the Hungarian troops, who started a hasty retreat, which was contributed to by the fact that Klapka lost contact with his troops while trying to cross the river far from them. The Rastiƒá and Sternberg brigades crossed the river via the bridge, took 10 Hungarian cannon and 4 ammunition caissons, and captured two Hungarian officers and 123 men.. The Croat batteries fired at the retreating Hungarians, who were fortunate that the terrain on this side of the river was quite broken ground, so their cavalry could not do its job of pursuing the retreating forces. At this dramatic moment G√∂rgei arrived on the scene, and tried unsuccessfully to stop the I Corps soldiers‚Äô retreat and to get them into battle order.. Damjanich J√°nos The battle seemed to be lost, until Damjanich's III Corps arrived on the battlefield. Before they deployed, Colonel Arisztid Dessewffy, with the remaining cavalry and artillery of I Corps which had not fled, managed to stop the advancing imperials amidst heavy fighting. Following G√∂rgei's order, Damjanich then took command of Wysocki‚Äôs division of his corps, and together with the Leiningen brigade, started to charge.. In the meantime, the fleeing troops of I Corps also regrouped. When the Hungarian soldiers of the 3rd and 9th Battalions of the III. Corps, arrived at the bridge after chasing the enemy back to the other side of the river, they started to argue about who would cross it first, losing precious time. The commander of the 3rd Battalion, Major K√°roly F√∂ldv√°ry ‚Äì a hero of several battles of the Hungarian War of Independence (he also distinguished himself in the Battle of V√°c) ‚Äì wrested the flag of the 9th Battalion from its commander's hand, and led both battalions across the bridge under a hail of bullets from the imperial troops. After chasing them from the outskirts of the village, the whole Wysocki division crossed and joined the pursuit. The retreating imperial troops set the village on fire to slow down the advancing Hungarians.. The cavalry of III Corps led by Colonel J√≥zsef Nagys√°ndor tried to pursue the retreating Austrians, but the terrain prevented them from doing this... Aftermath The Hungarian victory was made bitter-sweet by the fact that they could not recapture four of their guns which had been taken by the Austrians.. Additionally, Gy√∂rgy Klapka, normally a very capable general, had made a considerable tactical error in giving the order to attack T√°pi√≥bicske, because in doing so he had revealed the location of his troops. Because of this, G√∂rgei did not dare to give the order for the encirclement of the main imperial forces at Isaszeg and G√∂d√∂ll≈ë. According to L√°szl√≥ Pusztaszeri, Klapka thereby prevented a decisive Hungarian victory over Windisch-Gr√§tz.. R√≥bert Hermann believes that although G√∂rgei was uncertain what to do, he finally decided to order his troops to continue their movements according to the initial plan.. On the other hand, after the battle on 4 April, Jelaƒçiƒá falsely reported a Croat victory over the Hungarians. This misled Windisch- Gr√§tz, who did not understand what was happening on the south-eastern front, and contributed to him ordering the Ban of Croatia (Jelaƒçiƒá) to pursue the Hungarians, who in reality were not fleeing but nearing G√∂d√∂ll≈ë. He was totally unclear about where the Hungarian forces really were, and feared that their main forces would get around him either from the south, cutting his lines of communication with the capital, or from the north, liberating the fortress of Kom√°rom from the imperial siege. So Windisch-Gr√§tz scattered his forces on a 54-kilometer front, which made it impossible for his troops to support each other effectively (some units were more than a day's march apart). In contrast, the Hungarian front line was only 22 kilometers long, and so at all times during the battle G√∂rgei could concentrate up to two thirds of his force at any point of his front line. Windisch-Gr√§tz's error reduced his chance of victory against the Hungarian main forces in the Battle of Isaszeg which followed two days after T√°pi√≥bicske..

Guilford is currently the Vice- Chancellor at Victoria University of Wellington. Academic career After a Bachelor of Veterinary Science and Bachelor of Philosophy at Massey University, Guilford completed a PhD in nutrition from the University of California, Davis. The title of his 1993 thesis was Experimental Studies of Gastrointestinal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury and Food Sensitivity in Dogs. Following the completion of his PhD, Guilford worked at the University of Missouri and the University of California, Davis, before returning to New Zealand and Massey University, where he studied food allergies in domestic pets. Guilford was first author on the third edition of the veterinary textbook Strombeck's Small Animal Gastroenterology.  University administrative career  Guilford rose to professor and served for 10 years as the Foundation Head of the Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences at Massey University. The institute became the first veterinary school in the southern hemisphere to be accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association. Guilford faced opposition from animal rights activists, some of whom took direct action, with the Animal Liberation Front liberating dogs from a farm owned by the University.Press, 101cm 3 Sep 2005; p.D1-2; Guilford moved to the University of Auckland as Dean of Science in 2009 and Vice Chancellor of Victoria University of Wellington in 2013. During his time as Vice-Chancellor, Victoria University of Wellington has grown and modernized its physical campus, with a new science building opened by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, and creative studios in Miramar. There has been tension between Guilford's administration and staff represented by the Tertiary Education Union, where the University offered higher salaries to those who chose not to be union members. This, and other contributing factors, led to industrial action undertaken by union members. Under Guilford, the Victoria University of Wellington's Karori campus was sold to private developers. This prompted some controversy, as the university had acquired the land for $10 from the Ministry of Education, and sold it for an undisclosed sum (the land was valued in excess of $20 million) to Ryman for the purposes of making a retirement village. This led to tension between the Ministry of Education, the Wellington City Council, the Karori community, and Victoria University of Wellington as many considered that it was improper for the university to make such a profit off public land. Guilford later said Victoria University spent around $21 million upgrading the campus, challenging the idea that the University had made a $20 million profit from the land. In May 2018, Guilford announced that Victoria University of Wellington was considering renaming the institution to \\"The University of Wellington\\" to provide clarity and avoid confusion with other similarly-named institutions. Consultation on the proposal ended in early June 2018. Opposition to the proposed name change led to thousands of written submissions and a petition against the change being received from students, staff, graduates and alumni of the University. The Minister of Education declined the name change. The University then changed its logos and branding, minimising references to Victoria in a move described as \\"a name change by stealth.\\" Victoria University of Wellington divested itself from fossil fuels during Guilford's tenure as Vice-Chancellor. Guilford has called for politicians to act on climate change, and made a brief submission to the Ministry for the Environment consultation phase on setting New Zealand's post-2020 climate change target. In 2020, Guilford was criticised following Victoria University of Wellington's decision to charge residents of the university's closed halls of residence a $150 per week fee once New Zealand moved to COVID-19 alert level three on 28 April 2020.https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/victoria-university-students- blindsided-student-accommodation-holding-fee accessed 27/04/2020 Guilford responded to criticism with claims that the university would have to cut staff if the fee could not be collected.https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new- zealand/university-staff-may-fired-if-student-accommodation-holding-fees- arent-paid-victoria-vice-chancellor accessed 27/04/2020 This resulted in a student-led rent strike involving at least 1000 people.https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/415251/victoria-university- students-organise-rent-strike-to-protest-placeholder-fee In August of 2020, Guilford made another move unpopular with university staff when he unveiled plans to restructure the university, eliminating schools in order to focus administration on the faculty offices, which would result in significant job losses for administrative staff. Staff have described Guilford's plan as \\"cruel and insensitive\\", and accused Guilford of \\"pushing through too many projects focused on increasing revenue in order to break even by 2021, without addressing staff and student burnout\\".https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/122468327/victoria-staff- up-in-arms-over-controversial-plan-to-restructure- university?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm;_medium=twitter Accessed 20/08/2020 The University's postgraduate students association have also spoken out against Guilford, noting that most student support comes from the school offices he plans to cut.https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/122497986/students- join-staff-kicking-back-against-victoria-universitys-restructure-plan Furthermore, a survey of staff found that 88% of staff at the university did not trust the university's senior leadership, and over 50% were experiencing fatigue and anxiety.https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/122651688/a-matter-of- trust-victoria-university-staff-speak-out-over-divided-campus Victoria University Professor Lydia Wevers characterised Guilford's leadership as \\"a general failure to communicate well with staff\\", and noted that Guilford had cancelled all meetings with the staff union for the remainder of the 2020. In October of 2020, Salient heavily criticised Guilford's leadership in their review of the preceding academic year, noting his dishonesty regarding accommodation fees, the wasting of school funds on events that were unprofitable due to a lack of advertisement, the charging of international students four times more than domestic despite limited benefits under lockdown, and his refusal to upscale student grades due to the stresses incurred by the COVID-19 crisis (with VUW being the only university in New Zealand not to do so), as well as criticising his failure to communicate restructurings and job losses with staff and students.https://www.salient.org.nz/news/2020-in-review-how-vuw-fucked-us Accessed 13th October 2020.  Roles outside of academia  As of 2018, Guilford is on the board of the Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency (WREDA). He has previously held positions on the boards of several companies, including New Zealand Genomics Limited, centres of research excellence, including the Maurice Wilkins Centre for Molecular Biodiscovery, and the Crown research institute Landcare Research Limited.

Career Professor Carr's research, publication and teaching have been devoted to various aspects of Edmund Husserl's philosophy and to phenomenology in general.

The latter inquiry has led him to explore the nature of narrative, and has thus intersected with literary theory, Hegel's phenomenology, and analytic theories of history. Carr's work is explicitly opposed to that of Louis Mink, Hayden White, and Roland Barthes; Carr considered the basis of narrative structure to inhere in the human phenomenology of experience, even if not in what he described as \\"merely physical\\" events.Roth, B.

A vast majority of these migrants were Christians who had a completely different social and agricultural background. These hard working people brought new agricultural practices to this area. They introduced cash crops like rubber and daily staples like tapioca to the region. The migrants also brought a new attitude to the region, one that challenged the established Janmi-Kudian feudal system.SREEDHARA MENON A. KERALACHARITHRAM. D C Books, First edition. The migrants bought large tracts of land outright from the Janmis and put down permanent crops heralding an era of prosperity for the area.

Shipra Publications, 2005, First edition. Until the early 1950s, this region used outdated agricultural practices and depended on the Indian monsoons for its irrigation needs. Agricultural land lay fallow after harvest. At the beginning of the next growing season, the bushes that cover the land would be cleared and the plant material burned to prepare the land for the next cycle of rice cultivation. This method, known as 'punam krishi' allowed people to grow staples like rice and black gram.

Its name loosely translates to \\"Three-clawed animal with well displayed flesh\\". Phylogenetic analysis suggests that it was a close relative of the Onychophora, possibly even a member of the main lineage. The fossil was discovered in the Xiaotan section, Yongshan, Yunnan Province in the Yu'anshan Formation. The muscle fibres preserved in its legs establish peripheral musculature as a characteristic of all panarthropods, but are arranged in an unusual pattern (detailed below).  Features  = External features = The fossil found was small, with only one segment of the animal found. This was 1 millimeter long, and folded at the mid-point, with one pair of lobopods preserved and much of the dorsal body surface missing. This missing surface was actually an advantage to the scientists studying it as it revealed the muscle fibres within the body. The skin has circumferential wrinkles spaced at 10 Œºm apart, which divide and merge irregularly. These wrinkles bear small papillae which are thought to correspond to the dermal papillae of other extinct Onchyophora. Along the two lobopods the wrinkles become smaller and eventually give way to raised polygonal boundaries, which could mark cell borders in the skin tissue. The papillae continue along the lobopods, with bases of around 5Œºm across and about 7Œºm high. = Appendages = The fossil found had two lobopods preserved, each around 800Œºm long and with a uniform diameter of 80Œºm, not tapering. At the end of each lobopod there are three 30Œºm claws preserved, with an angle of 45¬∞ between each one. The raised centres of the impressions of these claws denote a hollow claw slightly longer than the 25Œºm impressions, hence the figure of 30Œºm. The lobopods had a circular cross-section, flattened in places, and are thought to be at the posterior end of the specimen with the claws pointing towards the anterior, as in other lobopodians. = Musculature = The muscles preserved were those inside the body cavity of the specimen, mostly making up the body wall. There were three layers of fibrous muscular tissue, each around 10Œºm thick. The outermost layer of muscle consisted of 5-10Œºm thick fibres, which part to leave a 60Œºm gap between the lobopods, thought to be a gonopore and part again near the outer edge of each lobopod, possibly for leg elevator muscle insertion. Inside this there was a layer of much thinner, interwoven oblique fibres. The innermost layer of fibres is oriented perpendicular to the body axis, presumably the remains of a more extensive layer of circular muscles.  Preservation  The preservation of the animal is unusual in several respects. Firstly, in Orsten-type microfossils muscle preservation is very rare and it is much more common that other tissue is preserved in phosphate in this way. Secondly, when onchyophorans are rotted in seawater or saline solution, body wall muscles are the first parts to decay, well before organs such as gonads or the gut and before harder parts such as the hollow claws present in this species, of which only the inner bases remain.  Evolutionary importance  Previously, due to the rarity both of onchyophoran fossils and preserved musculature, it was uncertain whether peripheral muscle was a characteristic of all panarthropods or just of primitive euarthropods and tardigrades (modern members of this clade have evolved skeletal muscle from the peripheral muscle in their ancestors). Tritonychus phanerosarkus shows that peripheral muscle was also a feature of onchyophorans, and thus of panarthropods as a whole. However, the evolution of three-layered muscle from the two-layered muscle of more ancestral fossils is not straightforward. In living onchyophorans, the outermost layer of muscle is circular, the middle interwoven oblique and the innermost longitudinal, reversing the order of those in Tritonychus. This leaves the homology of muscle layers unclear, to say the least. Tritonychus is clearly given a place within an 'onchyophoran-like' clade, however, due to skin similarities to other 'onchyophoran-like' lobopodians and to modern onchyophorans. These include bifurcating circumferential wrinkles, papillae mounted on solid bases, and (in parts) hexagonal patterning. This extends the record of these features into the lower Cambrian, along with the multiple layers of peripheral muscle and the possible gonopore.

It has been a Grade I listed building since 1984. History =Medieval and Tudor= There are few traces of Stratford Langthorne Abbey. Shown is the keystone from the charnel house door, now in All Saints. In the medieval era the church's parish included all of West Ham, with the one exception of the 24 acres within Stratford Langthorne Abbey's precincts, which formed a separate parish of St Mary and All Saints until the abbey was dissolved, that parish's church was destroyed and the parish itself merged into All Saints. There has been a building on the site since at least the late 12th century - the three blocked clerestory windows on either side of the present building's nave date to that time. One of the founding endowments for the Abbey was land that had belonged to \\"Ranulph the priest\\", implying the existence of a parish church. The first concrete reference is a charter of 1181-82 by Henry II of England which confirmed the church of West Ham to the abbey. Gilbert Foliot, bishop of London also assigned a vicar to the parish church around the same time. The building contains a relief and possibly the remains of a font from the Abbey. The nave was largely rebuilt halfway through the 13th century, adding five-bay arcades on the north and south sides. Its crossing was demolished around 1400 to add two bays to the nave's east end - the chancel arch was rebuilt and the west tower added at the same time. The abbey acquired the parish by 1334 and held onto it until the crown took it over after the Dissolution. A north chapel was added in mid 15th century, closely followed by a south chapel. Many of the windows in the north aisle seem to date to the late 15th century, implying another rebuilding in that area at that time, whilst wall paintings found in the nave during 19th century restorations probably also date to the 15th century. Around 1547 the churchwardens sold some of the church's communion plate and a property in Stratford to fund a rebuilding of the north chapel in brick, without the parish' permission - this included a turret for a stairwell into a rood screen on its north side. The Protestant Thomas Rose was made its vicar in 1552. =18th and 19th centuries= One of the present building's three fonts was added in 1707. In 1710 a west gallery was added, with an organ installed in it 21 years later. South and north galleries were added in 1727 and 1735 respectively. In 1763 the west gallery was rebuilt and in 1788-90 the pulpit altered. A long south porch had also been added by 1799, which survived until sometime in the 19th century. The south aisle, the south chapel and the chancel's east wall were all refaced with yellow stock brick in 1800-1803 and Thomas Holbrook provided a set of the royal arms for the church's east end in 1804. The parish's population was growing and all three galleries were expanded again in 1821-1824 to cope with the increased congregations. Even so, an 1827 account stated that only 12% of the parish's population could be seated. Chapels of ease began to be added to the parish, such as St Mary's Church, Plaistow in 1830 and St John's Church, Stratford in 1834 - these both later became parishes in their own right in 1844, taking parts of what had been All Saints parish, whilst the new parish church of Christ Church, Stratford also took part of All Saints parish on its foundation in 1852. Another part of All Saints parish was split off to join part of Emmanuel parish as a new parish for St Mark's Church, Forest Gate in 1894. George Dyson and George Gilbert Scott rebuilt All Saints in 1847-1849, replacing the box pews with modern pews that allowed for more free sittings and probably altering the old nave dormers into their present configuration. Scott was called in again in 1865-1869, removing the west gallery, inserting new windows and designing a new reredos. A second larger font was added to the nave's west end in 1869. Further restorations and alterations followed in 1879-1880 and 1892, removing the north and south galleries.A History of the County of Essex: Volume 6. Originally published by Victoria County History, London, 1973; Pages 114-123 All Saints also founded the mission churches of St Thomas's around 1878 (which took part of All Saints parish in 1891 and was merged back into All Saints' parish in 1961) and St Matthew's Church, West Ham in 1891. Part of All Saints parish was joined with parts of those of St John's Church, Stratford and Emmanuel Church, Forest Gate to form a new parish for St James' Church, Forest Gate. =Today= Two curiosities are worth noting in the present church: the baptismal font, dated 1707, which bears the name of three churchwardens instead of the usual two (the ancient parish was once divided into three wards and the custom continues); and the other is the clock in the tower, made in 1857 to Lord Grimthorpe's design, and the prototype of Big Ben.

The name of her mother, a midwife, is unknown, however her father was Thomas Rogers. She trained as a nurse at Christchurch Hospital from 1911 to 1913, then completed a midwifery certificate at St. Helens' Hospital. After qualifying, Rogers was a district nurse with the Nurse Maude organisation in Christchurch. While living in Christchurch, she was a member of St. Andrew‚Äôs Presbyterian Church, and a leader of the church's Young Women‚Äôs Bible Class. She volunteered to go to Vanuatu as a nursing missionary, to assist with the establishment of a hospital there, however a natural disaster destroyed the area she was to go to. First World War In July 1915, she enlisted in the New Zealand Army Nursing Service and left Wellington on board the SS Maheno. The ship sailed to Port Said, Egypt, and the contingent of nurses worked in a stationary hospital there. In October 1915 Rogers was on board the SS Marquette when it was torpedoed by a German submarine and sunk. Her body was found in a lifeboat with that of fellow nurse Helena Isdell, and four men, which washed ashore near the Greek town of Zagora. =Recognition= Rogers is named on the Mikra British Cemetery in Greece and in the Nurses' Memorial Chapel at Christchurch Hospital.

Berlin Art Week showcases contemporary art from all over the world, through events, exhibition openings, artist films and art fairs, spanning approximately 50 institutions, including established museums such as the Hamburger Bahnhof (contemporary art museum ‚Äì Museum f√ºr Gegenwart) as well as a great number of independent galleries.  Background  Berlin Art Week was founded in 2012 as successor of the art forum ‚Äì an internationally known art fair ‚Äì that had existed from 1996 until 2011. Berlin Art Week has established its reputation as the yearly key event for contemporary art in Berlin combining ‚Äúexhibitions, art fairs, art awards, and an auxiliary programme featuring talks, films, and tours. In addition, Berlin Art Week provides new, surprising insights into private collections, project spaces, and the city‚Äôs sites of artistic production.‚Äù At the heart of the Art Week are two fairs: abc ‚Äì art berlin contemporary ‚Äì founded in 2008, and Positions Berlin ‚Äì Art Fair founded in 2014. The abc fair was founded by 9 Berlin galleries and pursues a concept different from typical art fairs. abc wants to break with the traditional art fair approach, where each gallery has their separate booth. Instead abc provides larger open spaces that can be used by the presenting galleries to display anything from paintings or drawings to sculptures and installations. Galleries usually only present works by one artist, ideally a new production. The idea behind this is to create a coherent exhibition, fostering a dialogue, rather than present an eclectic collection of art pieces, presented separately and without a narrative. Positions Berlin on the other hand follows a more traditional approach providing separate booths to a multitude of national and international galleries. The goal of the Berlin Art Week is to further grow Berlin as an art hub that attracts artists, gallery owners, and collectors from all over the world. Berlin Art Week is sponsored by the Senate of Berlin.  Berlin Art Week 2016  The Berlin Art Week 2016 was the 5th Berlin Art Week and took place between September 13 and 18th. Similar to previous years, the Art Week attracted more than 100,000 visitors in 2016. However, there has been some speculation about a crisis of the Berlin Art Week and particularly its fairs: the abc reduced its showroom capacity in 2016 and only presented 62 galleries ‚Äì instead of 100 as was originally advertised on the Art Week website still at the beginning of September. Positions Berlin presented 74 galleries, keeping the number of galleries roughly constant. The next Berlin Art Week is scheduled for 12‚Äì17 September 2017.

Philadelphia Leadership  = American Bicentennial Rodeo = In 1974, Lazin conceived the idea to hold a rodeo as part of Philadelphia's U.S. Bicentennial Celebration. A neophyte to both rodeos and public event organizing, he visited major rodeos across the country and acquainted himself with Howard Harris III, one of the most highly regarded stock contractors. Through Harris, Lazin secured endorsement from the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association to hold a sanctioned American Bicentennial Rodeo in Philadelphia. The rodeo took place at JFK Stadium in late June through early July 1976. It included six competitions over five days with Congressman Clem McSpadden, the voice of American rodeos, announcing. Five of the six 1975 world champions and top competitors in the women's barrel racing participated. Each rodeo also featured Buffalo Bill Cody's grandson riding an Appaloosa horse, an antique stagecoach that traveled between Cheyenne and Deadwood City, Wyoming, a performance by the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma, and a race between the Philadelphia mounted police unit and the Cheyenne Sheriff's Posse.The American Bicentennial Rodeo. 23 June 1976.

In 1983, Lazin became president of Penn's Landing Development Corporation.\\"At-Large GOP Choices.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer, 27 April 2011, p. A18. Under his leadership, the corporation won the rights from Philadelphia to develop five piers in the central waterfront district. It rehabilitated a 180,000-square-foot pier for entertainment use, built a 90,000-square-foot parking deck where charred pilings once stood and constructed a 15,000-square-foot outdoor entertainment deck. The corporation also rehabilitated another 70,000-square-foot pier for servicing boats and developed Philadelphia's first full-service marina with 300 slips. Other companies initiated projects in the area; however, the district lacked sufficient infrastructure to accommodate and enhance the development. Lazin founded and was elected chair of the Philadelphia Waterfront Developers Council (1986-1989),Warner, Susan. \\"Developer's Group Picks New Leader.\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer, 19 June 1989, p. 7-C. which created a plan to redesign and rebuild the then dilapidated Delaware Avenue into a waterfront boulevard and successfully lobbied for access ramps to and from Interstate 95. = Benjamin Franklin Bridge Lighting = In 1985 when few buildings in Philadelphia were lit at night, Lazin conceived the notion to light the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.Ott, Dwight. \\"Company Sues to Get Ben Franklin Bridge Lighting Repossessed\\".

Its purpose was to secure inclusion of Washington Square into Independence National Historical Park (INHP) and to have an honorary military guard posted at the Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldier. Situated across from Independence Hall, the area is the largest Revolutionary War burial ground. Lazin successfully led a nearly two-decades-long campaign for the historical site. In 1992, Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujon signed a Memorandum of Understanding whereby the Department of the Interior committed to incorporate Washington Square into INHP, if the site could be brought up to National Park Service standards. After a 13-year undertaking to fund improvements and meet requirements, Washington Square was made part of Independence National Historical Park, which thereafter has overseen management and guided tours.Harris, Linda K. \\"Washington Square's Face-Lift is Almost Done‚ÄîThe National Park Service Will Soon Oversee the Resting Place of 2,000 American Soldiers.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer, 27 October 2002, p.

In the early 1990s, gay pride parades abounded. PrideFest focused instead on gay and lesbian organizations and on civil rights issues and aspirations. The first PrideFest involved 15 regional organizations presenting panel discussions over a weekend. By 1996, what was now PrideFest America had become a week-long event, including 60 regional, state and national organizations. In 1999, PrideFest named Lazin its first executive director.

In 1998, a German editor said there were 120,000 studies of Hitler and Nazi Germany. Since then a large number more have appeared, with many of them decisively shaping the historiography regarding Hitler.Volker Ullrich, Hitler: ascent, 1889-1939 (2016) p. 5 Major biographies =Heiden= The first important biography was written in exile in Switzerland by Konrad Heiden, Hitler: A Biography (2 vol Z√ºrich, 1936‚Äì1937); an English version appeared as Der F√ºhrer ‚Äì Hitler's Rise to Power (1944). Heiden was a journalist for a liberal newspaper who witnessed Hitler's rise to power firsthand, and fled to exile when he realized that he was a target of the regime. (He managed to escape the Gestapo). In his introduction Heiden wrote \\"the 'hero' of this book is neither a superman nor a puppet. He is a very interesting contemporary and, viewed quantitatively, a man who is stirred up the masses more than anyone else in human history.\\"Ullrich, Hitler: ascent, 1889-1939 (2016) p 2. Heiden was successful in analyzing Hitler as an orator, how he drew strength from his audience, learning which points to emphasize to maximize his impact. Hitler realized it was emotion, not rationality, he had to appeal to, using repetition, exaggeration, little lies and big lies, all the while vehemently denouncing the horrors of the past and promising a sparkling bright visions of the future. Like all early biographers, Heiden paid little attention to the anti-Semitic fulminations, or to Hitler's goals of destroying the Jews and seizing control of Eastern Europe for German resettlement.Ullrich, Hitler: ascent, 1889-1939 (2016) pp 2-3. =Bullock and J√§ckel= The Allies seized vast masses of documents in 1945, which British historian Alan Bullock (1914-2004) used with a brilliant writing style. Bullock's biography Hitler: A Study in Tyranny (1952) depicts Hitler as the product of the chaos in Germany after 1918, where uncertainty and anger inflamed extremism and created the ideal setting for Hitler's demagoguery to succeed. Bullock tells of a totally unprincipled opportunist, who had no deep values or goals, except seizing power by any means possible. In 1991, John Campbell wrote \\"Although written so soon after the end of the war and despite a steady flow of fresh evidence and reinterpretation, it has not been surpassed in nearly 40 years: an astonishing achievement.\\" Bullock's biography has generally stood the test of time, except that historians today reject the idea that Hitler was unprincipled, thanks especially to the work by German scholar Eberhard J√§ckel (b 1929), Professor of Modern History at the University of Stuttgart.Ullrich, Hitler: ascent, 1889-1939 (2016) pp 1-12 In the 1970s and 1980s his demonstration of Hitler's unwavering commitment to a few extreme principles of removing Jews and conquering living space in the East is no longer disputed.Eberhard J√§ckel, Hitler and history (1984) J√§ckel argues that Mein Kampf was not only a \\"blueprint\\" for power, but also for genocide. In J√§ckel's view: :He had to annihilate the Jews, thus restoring the meaning of history, and with the thus restored, nature-intended struggle for existence, he at the same time had to conquer new living space for the German people. Each of these tasks was inextricably linked to the other. Unless the Jews were annihilated there would very soon no longer be any struggle for living space, nor therefore any culture and consequently nations would die out; not just the German nation, but ultimately all nations. But if, on the other hand, the German people failed to conquer new living space, it would die out because of that and the Jews would triumph\\".Cited in Michael Marrus, The Holocaust In History (2000) p. 15. =Structuralism= Academic historians by the 1960s were heavily committed to social history, and rejected the great man interpretation of the past. That meant biography could be a popular art form, but was theoretically incapable of explaining great events. Popular historians, biographers, and the general public disregarded these abstract laws history, and demanded colorful history based on idiosyncratic personality traits. This popular approach was based on what scholars call \\"intentionalism.\\"Ian Kershaw, Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris (1998) pp xii-xiii Who ordered the Holocaust has been a central theme of the debate. Intentionalists maintained that Adolf Hitler intended from the earliest days of his political career to exterminate the Jews. Functionalists (or structuralists) argued that although Hitler had a longstanding murderous hatred of Jews, his plan to exterminate them did not arise until bureaucratic opportunities and world events (such as war with Russia) converged to make extermination functionally possible. The debate largely faded away after 1980 as such scholars as Ian Kershaw and Michael Burleigh increasingly agreed that \\"intention\\" and \\"structure\\" are both essential to understanding Nazi Germany and need synthesis rather than opposition.Richard Bessel, \\"Functionalists vs. Intentionalists: The Debate Twenty Years on 'or' Whatever Happened to Functionalism and Intentionalism?\\" German Studies Review (2003) 26#1 pp 15-20. For example, taking note of the shift of interest among professional historians toward social history in the 1960s, Alan Bullock agreed that in general deep long-term social forces are decisive in history. But not always, he argued, for there are times when the Great Man is decisive. In revolutionary circumstances, \\"It is possible for an individual to exert a powerful even a decisive influence on the way events develop and the policies that are followed....After the pendulum has swung between exaggerating and underestimating [individuals]...the longer perspective suggests that in both cases neither the historical circumstances nor the individual personality is sufficient explanation by itself without the other\\"Alan Bullock, Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives (1991) pp 976, 977 Those historians who took an intentionalist line, like Andreas Hillgruber, argued that everything that happened after the invasion of the USSR in 1941 was part of a masterplan he credited Hitler with developing in the 1920s. Hillgruber wrote in his 1967 book Germany and the Two World Wars that for Hitler: :The conquest of European Russia, the cornerstone of the continental European phase of his program, was thus for Hitler inextricably linked with the extermination of these \\"bacilli\\", the Jews. In his conception they had gained dominance over Russia with the Bolshevik Revolution. Russia thereby became the center from which a global danger radiated, particularly threatening to the Aryan race and its German core. To Hitler, Bolshevism meant the consummate rule of Jewry, while democracy ‚Äì as it had developed in Western Europe and Weimar Germany ‚Äì represented a preliminary stage of Bolshevism, since the Jews there won a leading, if not yet a dominant, influence. This racist component of Hitler's thought was so closely interwoven with the central political element of his program, the conquest of European Russia, that Russia's defeat and the extermination of the Jews were ‚Äì in theory as later in practice ‚Äì inseparable for him. To the aim of expansion per se, however, Hitler gave not racial, but political, strategic, economic and demographic underpinnings.Andreas Hillgruber, Germany And The Two World Wars (1981) p 51. The German historian Helmut Krausnick argued that: : What is certain is that the nearer Hitler's plan to overthrow Russia as the last possible enemy on the continent of Europe approached maturity, the more he became obsessed with an idea‚Äîwith which he had been toying as a \\"final solution\\" for a long time‚Äîof wiping out the Jews in the territories under his control. It cannot have been later than March 1941, when he openly declared his intention of having the political commissars of the Red Army shot, that he issued his secret decree‚Äîwhich never appeared in writing though it was mentioned verbally on several occasions‚Äîthat the Jews should be eliminated.Marrus p 39. Streim wrote in response that Krausnick had been taken in by the line invented after the war to reduce the responsibility of the Einsatzgruppen leaders brought to trial.Alfred Stream, \\"The Tasks of the SS Einsatzgruppen\\" in Michael Marrus, ed., The Nazi Holocaust, Part 3, The \\"Final Solution\\": The Implementation of Mass Murder, Volume 2 (1989) pages 436‚Äì454\\". on pp. 439‚Äì40 Against the intentionalist interpretation, functionalist historians like Martin Broszat argued that the lower officials of the Nazi state had started exterminating people on their own initiative.Martin Broszat, \\"Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses\\" in H.W. Koch, ed., Aspects of the Third Reich (1985). pp. 390‚Äì429. p. 399‚Äì404 Broszat argued that the Holocaust began ‚Äúbit by bit‚Äù as German officials stumbled into genocide.Marrus, p. 41. Broszat argued that in the fall of 1941 German officials had begun \\"improvised\\" killing schemes as the \\"simplest\\" solution.Broszat, \\"Genesis of the 'Final Solution'‚Äù p 408 In Broszat's analysis, Hitler subsequently approved of the measures initiated by the lower officials and allowed the expansion of the Holocaust from Eastern Europe to all of Europe.Broszat, \\"Genesis of the 'Final Solution'‚Äù pp 408-13 In this way, Broszat argued that the Shoah was not begun in response to an order, written or unwritten, from Hitler but was rather ‚Äúa way out of the blind alley into which the Nazis had manoeuvred themselves‚Äù.Marrus p. 41 The American historian Christopher Browning has argued that: :Before the invasion, the Einsatzgruppen were not given explicit orders for the total extermination of Jews on Soviet territory. Along with the general incitement to an ideological and racial war, however, they were given the general task of liquidating \\"potential\\" enemies. Heydrich's much-debated directive of 2 July 1941 was a minimal list of those who had to be liquidated immediately, including all Jews in state and party positions. It is very likely, moreover, that the Einsatzgruppen leaders were told of the future goal of a Judenfrei [Jew-free] Russia through systematic mass murder. Swiss historian Philippe Burrin argues that such a decision was not made before August 1941 at the earliest. Browning argues that sometime in mid-July 1941 Hitler made the decision to begin general genocide owing to his exhilaration over his victories over the Red Army, whereas Burrin contends that the decision was made in late August 1941 owing to Hitler's frustration over the slowing down of the Wehrmacht.Cited in Laurence Rees, The Nazis: A Warning From History (1997) p. 195. Kershaw argues that the dramatic expansion in both the range of victims and the intensity of the killings after mid-August 1941 indicates that Hitler issued an order to that effect, most probably a verbal order conveyed to the Einsatzgruppen commanders through either Himmler or Heydrich.Ian Kershaw, Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution (2008) p. 259 =Fest= Joachim Fest (1926-2006) was a German historian who wrote a biography of Hitler, Hitler: Eine Biographie (1973) which was the first major biography of Hitler since Alan Bullock's Hitler: A Study in Tyranny (1952) and was the first by a German writer. It was much praised by reviewers for its elegant style. Fest relied almost entirely on published sources, thereby avoiding the archival research that historians specialize in. He sees Hitler as a \\"singular personality,\\" and downplays structuralism or indeed any systematic analysis of political and social context. He made his strongest statement against the structuralist historiography. Historians agreed to the quality of the work, but they noted that he downplayed the key role of conservative elites who enabled the Nazis come to power in 1933.Ullrich, Hitler: ascent, 1889-1939 (2016) p 4. =Kershaw= British historian Ian Kershaw (born 1943) wrote a two-volume biography of Hitler between 1998-2000 (Hitler 1889‚Äì1936: Hubris and Hitler 1936‚Äì1945: Nemesis) which has been hailed by historians as definitive, and had not been displaced at the top of the bibliographies. His approach is to emphasize structural factors, and then bring in Hitler's personality by arguing that the top leadership, the middle leadership, and even the lower ranks of the Nazi movement devoted themselves to working towards the Fuehrer's supposed wishes, whether or not he had ever expressed those wishes, in the hopes of gaining the Fuehrer's approval. Kershaw depicts Hitler's leadership as charismatic, which emphasizes his profound influence on the audience, and so the audience‚Äîand thereby the German society as a whole‚Äîwas acting under his very broad command.Ian Kershaw, Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris (1998) xii-xiii. =Toland= American historian John Toland (born 1912) wrote a biography of Hitler (1976) which was based on an extensive amount of original research, such as previously unpublished documents, diaries, notes, photographs, and interviews with Hitler‚Äôs colleagues and associates. =Ullrich= German historian Volker Ullrich (born 1943) wrote a two-volume biography of Hitler, the first edition was published in German in 2013 and was translated into English in 2016 (Hitler - A Biography, Volume 1: Ascent 1889-1939). He depicts Hitler as a narcissist who was both clownish and deceitful and who rose to power using slick propaganda at a time the German elite was too dysfunctional to realize the danger he posed.Michiko Kakutani, In ‚ÄòHitler,‚Äô an Ascent From ‚ÄòDunderhead‚Äô to Demagogue\\" New York Times Sept. 27, 2016 Historikerstreit re Nazi Germany The Historikerstreit (\\"historians' quarrel\\") was an intellectual and political controversy in the late 1980s in West Germany about the crimes of Nazi Germany, including their comparability with the crimes of the Soviet Union. The Historikerstreit pitted right-wing against left-wing intellectuals. The positions taken by the right-wing intellectuals were largely based on the totalitarianism approach which takes a comparative approach to totalitarian states, while left-wing intellectuals argued that fascism was uniquely evil, referred to as the Sonderweg approach, and could not be equated with the crimes of Soviet communism. The former were accused by their critics of downplaying Nazi crimes, while the latter were accused by their critics of downplaying Soviet crimes. The debate attracted much media attention in West Germany, with its participants' frequently giving television interviews and writing op-ed pieces in newspapers. It flared up again briefly in 2000 when one of its leading figures, Ernst Nolte, was awarded the Konrad Adenauer Prize for science.

Its design is based on the premise that, when solving a problem, a student performs a sequence of computations (i.e., proceeds in an algorithmic way), that can be expressed in a computer language, similarly to how it is done on a notebook or blackboard. Besides the environment and the academic contents, ToolboX compiles students' usage data and process it by means of big data algorithms based on artificial intelligence (just in the Andalusian region, a million students have access to this tool, after being integrated in the Guadalinex and Guadalinfo repositories). These techniques perform knowledge acquisition about the students community, that can be used afterwards to improve teaching and resource planning. As examples of this knowledge, gifted students, ADHD and dyslexia can be prediagnosed.  Functioning  ToolboX is a didactic resource that teachers can use at the classroom or in the computer room. When the program is launched, it shows a simple development environment, made of a command window, a text editor to write the program, and an optional graphic window. After choosing a problem list, the student must solve each of them by writing a program. It also provides help commands (to be executed in the command window) and other commands for debugging and running the program. When the solution computed by the program is correct, it shows the next problem, until the whole list is completed. The programming language used is GNU Octave, for being a scientific programming language, widely used in education, science and engineering.  Problem definition  ToolboX is based on the notion of problegram to represent problems of a wide range of academic subjects. The definition includes information like the statement, tips or wiki help, its (alpha)numeric solution, proposed programs (in different languages), and a take-home-message after the task is solved. The relations of problems (or modules) are just lists with the names of the files in JSON format. { \\"class\\": \\"wordproblem\\", \\"statement\\": \\"Determine $$ \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\right)^2$$\\", \\"solution\\": \\"4/9\\", \\"tip\\" : [\\"Raise numerator and denominator to the same power.\\"], \\"keyword\\": [\\"mathematics\\", \\"rationals\\"], \\"wiki\\" : [\\"\\\\poweroffraction\\"], \\"hint\\" : { \\"js\\" : \\"\\", \\"octave\\": \\"\\" }, \\"program\\" : { \\"js\\" : \\" numerator = pow(2, 2); denominator = pow(3, 2); solution = numerator / denominator; }, \\"octave\\": \\" numerator = 2^2 denominator = 3^2 solution = numerator / denominator\\" }, \\"takehomemessage\\": \\"The power of a fraction derives from the product of fractions.\\", \\"author\\": \\"ToolboX\\", \\"URL\\" : \\"toolbox.uma.es\\", \\"CC\\" : \\"BY-NC-SA 3.0\\" }  Installation  ToolboX can be installed in the Andalusian public centers from the Guadalinex repository, as well as in the Andalusian network of rural centers Guadalinfo. The program can also be installed out of these networks, in two different ways: = With a deb file = On a computer with a Debian-based Linux distribution (like Ubuntu, Stretch, Raspbian, Lubuntu), ToolboX can be installed from a deb file following these steps: Ubuntu version history#Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) $ wget -N --quiet toolbox.uma.es/download/toolbox_latest.deb $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo dpkg -i toolbox_latest.deb dpkg: dependency problems prevent ... [other messages] $ sudo apt-get -f install [other messages] Setting up [dependency] ... Ubuntu version history#Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) $ wget -N --quiet toolbox.uma.es/download/toolbox_latest.deb $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo gdebi toolbox_latest.deb ... = With an ISO file = The ISO file must be first downloaded, and then install UNetbootin. Next, a pen drive (+4GB) is plugged in, UNetbootin is run, and the ISO file is burnt as a live version with persistent storage (this process will erase the pen drive, which must be copied beforehand, if needed): # select the downloaded ISO file # specify the size of the persistent storage (optional), for example 1000MB # select the unit where the pen drive is plugged. When the copy process completes, the system is restarted from the live version on the pen drive, which is selected as the booting method (this might demand interrupting the restart at the beginning by pressing a special key, like ESC, F2 or F9 on the PC, or Alt key on a Mac) to access the BIOS and select the preferred booting method. Once the system has booted from the live version, the main menu can be accessed from the upper-left corner, and ToolboX can be found in the Programming category.  User instructions  After running ToolboX, the screen is divided into three areas: a system console, a text editor, and a graphic window. By typing the 'task' or 'help' commands in the console, information is obtained on the task modules and the list of available commands. Once a task is loaded with command 'task', 'tip' and 'wiki' might provide additional information. Each task is solved by typing a program on the text editor, and running it with the 'go' command in the console. Distribution In version 0.0, it was oriented to the Spanish educational system and included problem lists for all pre- university subjects. It was distributed in a USB flash drive provided to the students, which instructors can apply for online. This drive contains a live Linux distro, the interpreter of the GNU Octave programming language, and the ToolboX and necessary software. ToolboX is currently distributed under GNU GPLv3 license. Its first version includes a repository of tasks for several subjects of pre-college education (mathematics, physics and chemistry). The source code is available in a public repository.

They took over a church and a hospital and held priests, medical staff and patients hostage. Government forces surrounded the Muslim extremists, preventing their escape. However, the Abu Sayyaf group managed to break out of the cordon by using their hostages as human shields. Background On 27 May 2001, members of the Abu Sayyaf group abducted 20 hostages, including three US citizens, from the Dos Palmas resort in Honda Bay, Palawan. The hostages were then taken across the Sulu Sea, back into Abu Sayyaf territory in Mindanao.\\"Manhunt\\", Mark Bowden, The Atlantic, March 2007, p.54 (15) The next day, then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared an \\"all-out-war\\" against the extremist group. Military operations geared towards pursuing the Abu Sayyaf and recovering the hostages were intensified. The siege At 4:00 in the morning of 2 June 2001, the Abu Sayyaf entered Lamitan, Basilan with their hostages. They took over the Dr. Jose Torres Memorial Hospital and the St. Peter's Church compound. The group's leader, identified as Abu Suleiman, claimed that his unit was a \\"suicide squad\\" and that they were holding 200 hostages; government forces however, belied the claim and stated that the extremists only had twenty hostages under their control. Suleiman demanded that the military cease their pursuit operations, if not, he threatened to execute the hostages. Government forces surrounded the hospital and church complex and called on the Abu Sayyaf to surrender. In order to keep the soldiers at bay, the extremists deployed snipers from the rooftops. Witnesses reported that helicopter gunships and soldiers responded with rocket and machine gun fire right into the compound. As the fighting progressed, four hostages were able to escape their captors. As darkness fell, the Abu Sayyaf managed to escape from the compound, taking with them the remaining eleven of the original twenty hostages from Dos Palmas, and an additional five captives from the hospital, including nurse Ediborah Yap. Five other hostages managed to escape during the confusion of the night-time withdrawal, as the Abu Sayyaf covered their escape with a heavy volume of gunfire and used children and hostages as human shields. Aftermath After the Lamitan siege, the Abu Sayyaf captured additional hostages, including plantation workers from Lantawan, Basilan. In subsequent months, some of the hostages were either freed or managed to escape. One of the three Americans, Guillermo Sobero, was beheaded. The remaining Americans, husband and wife Martin and Gracia Burnham, continued to be held by the Abu Sayyaf until 7 June 2002, when government troops finally caught up with the Muslim extremists. In the subsequent gun battle, Martin Burnham and nurse Ediborah Yap were killed. Gracia Burnham was rescued, although she sustained wounds. In 2004, fourteen jailed Abu Sayyaf members, as well as three of their comrades who escaped from custody were sentenced to death for their part in the Lamitan siege. In 2014, another Abu Sayyaf member, Nasser Usman, was arrested for his role in the Lamitan siege as well as his participation in the 1995 Ipil massacre. Controversy A subsequent congressional investigation found \\"strong circumstantial evidence\\" of collusion between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Abu Sayyaf. It recommended that Jovenal Narcise, commander of the 103rd Infantry Brigade, the Philippine Army unit that responded to the Abu Sayyaf attack, be subjected to a court martial. Narcise and other military officers, however, were cleared of any liability for the Abu Sayyaf's escape during a pre-trial investigation. The parish priest of Lamitan, Cirilo Nacorda, himself a victim of kidnapping before by the Abu Sayyaf, claimed that the military commanders connived with the Abu Sayyaf, allowing the extremists to escape in exchange for part of the ransom paid for the freedom of some of the Dos Palmas hostages. Narcise and his immediate superior, commander of the 1st Infantry Division Romeo Dominguez, were relieved from their posts.

While in England he made literary contribution to several journals, notably a series \\"Lives of the Apostles\\" for the Christian Witness. In 1860 he emigrated with his wife and children to South Australia, where he was appointed minister of the Clayton Congregational Church in a part of Kensington now known as Beulah Park. In 1862, following some kind of difficulty within the church, he started on a journalistic career as a leader writer for the South Australian Register, but continued to serve as pastor at Clayton Church until 1865, when the post was filled by the Rev. Eliezer Griffiths (1827‚Äì1920). In 1872, when Griffiths left for England, Harcus served in an honorary capacity for some six months until a permanent replacement, Thomas Hope (1846‚Äì1916), was appointed. In 1867 he left the Register for its competitor, The Advertiser, where on the death of J. H. Barrow, he took over the position of Editor. Aside from serious journalism, he was a capable poet and humorous writer, noted for his \\"Laconic Leader\\" columns in The Advertiser.

The site was previously home to a \\"Forest Prison\\" that incarcerated those who committed offences against the Royal Forest of Waltham, which is now known as Epping Forest. The gaol was built around 1620 and the building remained until 1827. It was built between 1832 and 1834 by Edward Blore in the Early English style using grey brick. The most notable feature is a three-stage tower, surmounted by a spire which is supported with flying buttresses. It is a Grade II Listed building. It was built as a chapel of ease to save worshippers the journey to the ancient parish church of All Saints West Ham; St John's Stratford became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1844. The poet Gerard Manley Hopkins was baptised in the church as an infant in August 1844. Part of St John's parish was split off in 1865 to provide a parish for St Paul's Church, Stratford, previously a mission church. In 1881 another part of St John's parish was also joined to parts of the parishes of All Saints and Emmanuel Church to form a new parish for the church of St James' Church, Forest Gate. The naturalist and social reformer Antonio Brady is buried in the churchyard in 1881; an extension to the chancel of the church was constructed in his memory in 1884. A memorial to the Stratford Martyrs was added to the churchyard in 1879. In World War II, the church crypt served as an air raid shelter for local people, despite bomb damage to the building itself. In 1961 St John's took over the parish of the deconsecrated Christ Church, Stratford. A new extension was added in 1998. Between 1988 and 1994, the church was the \\"home\\" of the influential post-rock group Bark Psychosis, who rehearsed in the crypt.

She is fully dedicated to photography in various fields: video art, cinema, as well as teaching. Her works have been presented in festivals, fairs and also, individual/group exhibitions around the world, as at the Paris' Tokyo Palais, C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes or the Palacio de Cibeles (Madrid, Spain), The KunstHalle or the Deutsche Oper (Berl√≠n), Project Art Space (Nueva York), MUA (Alicante, Spain) or Da2 (Salamanca, Spain). She currently lives in Berlin, Germany, where she takes advantage of the closeness to nature and the light of the north to incorporate them into her work.  Biography and education  She received a double degree from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid in Advertising and Public Relations, and Audiovisual Communication. She then completed the EFTI international master's degree, specializing in Conceptual Photography and Artistic Creation in 2011. In 2013, thanks to a scholarship, she took a specialized course on cinematographic narrative lighting (cinematographic photography direction) at the same center. After finishing her studies, Irene Cruz began her professional career as a photographer, developing a style centered on the mysterious, private and natural, with light being a very important factor in her work. Later, she also began to work as a video artist, focusing on video as a moving image, maintaining a style very similar to her photography. Later, in 2017, she directed her first feature film as director of photography \\"Diana\\" (Alejo Moreno, starring Ana Rujas and Jorge Rold√°n), which premiered at the Malaga Film Festival 2018, and which has been screened at various festivals and venues in Spain, Germany, USA, Poland, etc. Irene Cruz has also participated in various fairs such as ARCO or Art Madrid, Positions (Berlin), Art Basel, Photo Basel. In April 2017 she was the guest artist and image of the Photography Festival La Quatrieme Image in Paris and at Photoespa√±a (Madrid). She has taught in schools such as EFTI or TMF (Madrid) in ABBE Geneva (Switzerland) Art von Frei, FotoKlubKollektiv or Unicorn (Berlin), Fiftydots or ACLAM in Barcelona . She also teaches this subject at Freie Universit√§t in Berlin or at UAL in London. Among her mentors, Isabel Mu√±oz stands out (she was his Assistant in 2018 / 2019 in one of her trips to Japan). Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Merch√°n (Professor at the Complutense University of Madrid) and Venancio Blanco (Artist). Since December 2019, she is part of the national association AEC (Spanish Association of Directors of Photography) and CIMA (Association of Women Filmmakers and Audiovisual Media) and in Berlin she is part of the organization of Stammtisch Women in Cinema Berlin as well as active member of the collective The Women+ Film Network Berlin. As Director of Photography, in addition to \\"Diana\\" (Fiction, Alejo Moreno, 101 min, 2018) she has been the DOP of \\"Hechos Probados\\" (series of 3 chapters of 60 min each + 1 feature film, TBD, 2020) although she has also made several video clips, advertising campaigns (the last one she directed entirely for Levis, both graphic and audiovisual), video art pieces (highlighting her work at the Deutsche Oper 2014, 2016) and short documentaries.  Style and characteristics of work  Irene Cruz's work can be framed within conceptual photography. One of the characteristics that stand out most in her work is natural light, especially the light from Northern Europe. In her works, the connection between the cultural and natural aspects of life stands out. She is fascinated by the \\"liminal\\", such as the transition between day and night or the tranquillity and restlessness, which she tries to capture and transmit with her works. The characters, both in her photographs and videos, do not usually have a defined character but rather remain anonymous. Their faces are rarely shown, so that the viewer who observes the scene assumes a voyeuristic role, all the more so because these characters are often young women wearing ethereal dresses or nude. Her works often depict scenes in nature, creating a somber and mysterious atmosphere. Through her video art and photographs she presents different contexts such as melancholy, loneliness and exploration, all of which are linked to the feeling of loneliness and from a self-referential point of view. An intrinsically personal style can be appreciated in her work as a director of photography.

It is owned and operated by the Loch Lomond Steamship Company. It is thought to be Europe's last steam operated winch and it is contained within a railway-style winch house that is category A listed.  Infrastructure  The complex includes a slipway, carriage, boiler, steam engine and hauling gear and winch house.  History  The was annually hauled out of Loch Lomond during the winter The steam engine The slipway construction started in 1900 and it was opened by the Dunbarton & Balloch Joint Line CommitteeHume, p.109 in 1902 and finally fell out of use circa 1989. The railway-style winch house is a category A listed building. Following a ¬£620,000 restoration project the Balloch slipway complex was officially reopened by the Princess Royal in 2006. George Halliday Ltd. of Rothesay and John Bennie of Glasgow were the original contractors. The was re-assembled on the slipway in 1953 following its construction, disassembly and transport by rail to a siding lying parallel to the slipway and launched on 25 May 1953. The Maid was taken onto the slip on 27 June 2006 after 25 years berthed at Balloch Pier. Workings details =The boiler= The present reconditioned vertical water-tube boiler was taken from a steam crane built in 1953 that had been converted to diesel. To reduce smoke nuisance was converted to burn light oil by McEwen Ltd. of Keighley in Yorkshire. It was built by Cowans, Sheldon of Carlisle and is a Spencer-Hopwood pattern, with has an operating pressure of . =The steam engine= The steam engine installed is a twin horizontal single-expansion design built in 1902 by John Bennie of Glasgow with a rated power of and an actual or shaft power output of . The length of the piston stroke is . On the last few occasions that the winch was used prior to restoration the steam engine was powered by compressed air to save buying a new boiler. =The winch= Three sets of gears on the winch create a gear ratio of approximately 1:113 so that 113 turns of the steam engine are required to turn the winding drum with its steel cable just one full rotation, however this gives enough force to pull even a ship the size of the Maid of the Loch slowly out of the water. =The carriage or cradle= The carriage was badly damaged when the was broken up on the slipway in 1999 and a new deck was made from Douglas Fir at Bellshill in Lanarkshire. As many components as possible of the old carriage were re-used. Twenty-four two-wheeled bogies run on either side of the central rails that have 41 four-wheeled bogies and the whole carriage structure runs upon these. The four cast iron rails run over 300 feet into the waters of the loch and this section was badly corroded. Two central rails have a locking rack between them so that pawls on the central bogies can drop down and lock the carriage or cradle firmly in position as required. The gradient of the slip is 1 in 18 and the total length of the rails is 560 feet or 171 metres. The angle on the carriage, combined with the angle of the slip gives the suitable overall gradient of 1 in 44.5 for a ship.  The site today  The ¬£620,000 restoration means that the can be removed from the water whenever required and other Loch Lomond ships can also use this facility. The winch house was never previously open to the public however it now has frequently open days and has regular 'in steam' open days. The paddlesteamer is berthed at the nearby Balloch Pier. The Loch Lomond Shores visitor attractions and retail outlets are located nearby.

His father worked firstly in Brighton and then in Liverpool, where the younger Jones received his schooling. After contracting typhoid in his youth, the younger Jones decided on a career in medicine and set his heart on orthopedic surgery after he underwent an operation to remove a hemangioma.Hagy, Mark, \\"'Keeping up with the Joneses' - the story of Sir Robert Jones and Sir Reginald Watson-Jones\\", Iowa Orthopedic Journal, vol. 24 (2004), pp. 133‚Äì137 He joined the Medical School of Liverpool University, graduating with a first-class Bachelor of Science degree in 1922, his Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery degrees two years later, and a Masters of Orthopedic Surgery in 1926.\\"Sir Reginald Watson- Jones\\", Times (London), 11 August 1972, p. 14 He would be remembered as one of the school's \\"most brilliant students then and since\\",Osmond-Clarke, H., \\"Sir Reginald Watson-Jones, M.Ch.Orth., F.R.C.S., F.R.C.S.Ed., F.R.C.S.C., F.R.A.C.S., F.A.C.S.\\", Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, vol. 51, issue 4 (October 1972), p. 265‚Äì266 winning numerous prizes. He was named Mitchell Banks Medallist (1920), George Holt Medallist (1921) and Robert Gee Prizeman (1923). In 1921, he received the Senior Lyon Jones Scholarship and two years later took the George Holt Fellowship in Physiology, before receiving the Samuel's Research Scholarship in Surgery in 1926. In 1923, he became a demonstrator in Anatomy and Physiology,\\"Watson-Jones, Sir Reginald\\", Who Was Who (online edition), Oxford University Press, April 2014. Retrieved 29 September 2016. and received the Conjoint Diploma at Liverpool in 1924.  Career  Jones became a surgeon at Liverpool Royal Infirmary and Great Ormond Street Hospital after qualifying in medicine.Bentley, George, \\"Jones, Sir Reginald Watson- (1902‚Äì1972)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 While at Liverpool, he blossomed under the guidance of the eminent orthopedic surgeon Robert Jones (of no relation), who recommended him to be appointed honorary assistant surgeon at the Infirmary in 1926. In 1927 he was appointed a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. Jones was appointed a surgeon at the Country Orthopedic Hospital at Gobowen and took up an honorary position at North Wales Sanatorium. He began publishing articles in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery in the early 1930s and produced an average of three a year from then on. His contributions earned him recognition and he began teaching a popular course on fractions at Liverpool University in 1936, which prompted him to work on a textbook; Fractures and Joint Injuries, which appeared in 1940, was reprinted and translated many times and called a \\"masterpiece\\". Its clear and accessible language meant that it became a valued guidebook to field surgeons in World War II. In 1937 Watson changed his surname to 'Watson-Jones' but kept 'Watson' as a separate middle name to distinguish himself from many of the other people called Jones in Liverpool.The London Gazette, 31 August 1937 (issue 34431), p. 5542 During the early years of World War II, Watson-Jones remained a civilian consultant to the Royal Air Force. He set up ten units of 100‚Äì150 beds each across the United Kingdom to house recovering pilots; his emphasis on rehabilitation meant that many were able to return to active service. In 1942, he established the Department of Orthopaedics and Accidents at the London Hospital and in 1945 he was knighted for his service to the war efforts. Three years later, he was instrumental in establishing the British volume of the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (BJBJS) and became its editor (serving until his death). He spoke out against the establishment of the National Health Service, writing in 1948 that private practice was an essential component of medical progress. Meanwhile, he was a member of the Royal College of Surgeon's Council between 1943 and 1959; he was appointed the College's Hunterian Professor in 1945 and Sims Commonwealth Travelling Professor in 1950, before serving as Vice- President in 1953‚Äì54; he delivered the Hunterian Oration in 1959. He was also Orthopedic Surgeon to George VI from 1946 to 1952 and Extra Orthopedic Surgeon to Elizabeth II from 1952 to his death, as well as President of the Orthopedic Section of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1956, and of the British Orthopedic Association in 1952‚Äì53. Watson-Jones's surgical work was characterised by meticulous attention to detail and precision, and he expected no different from his students, while he kept unusually detailed and orderly notes on all his consultations. His work, especially during the war, but before it too, brought new ways of treating fracture into mainstream medical practice, and his publications and work with the BJBJS meant that they were available for surgeons across the world to use.  Personal life  Watson- Jones married twice: firstly in 1930 to Muriel Emily, daughter of Charles William Cook, who died in 1970, and secondly, a year later, to Muriel Wallace Robertson, a nurse; he adopted two children (a son and a daughter) with his first wife. He died 9 August 1972. His obituaries call him a \\"warm and attractive man ... a very great 'doctor' and one of the outstanding orthopedic surgeons of his generation\\". Another study of his life states that, along with his mentor Robert Jones, he \\"laid the foundation for a strong history of British orthopaedics\\".

It has smooth bark, egg-shaped to broadly elliptic to lance-shaped adult leaves, flowers buds in groups of three or seven, creamy white flowers and cup-shaped to cylindrical fruit. Description Corymbia grandifolia is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth white to pale grey bark that is shed in thin flakes. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped leaves that are long, wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, egg-shaped to broadly elliptic to lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The tree loses its leaves in the dry season. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on the leafless branchlets, on a branched peduncle up to long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are pear- shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum that sometimes has a central point or knob. Flowering occurs from September to January and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a cup-shaped to cylindrical capsule long, wide on pedicels long and with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Cabbage gum was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham from an unpublished description by Robert Brown and was given the name Eucalyptus grandifolia. Bentham's description was published in Flora Australiensis. In 1995 Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia grandifolia. In the same paper, Hill and Johnson described three subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Corymbia grandifolia (R.Br. ex Benth.) K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson subsp. grandifolia; * Corymbia grandifolia subsp. lamprocardia L.A.S.Johnson; * Corymbia grandifolia subsp. longa L.A.S.Johnson. Distribution and habitat Corymbia grandifolia grows in open forest, in woodland near watercourses and swamps and rocky slopes or flats in skeletal sandy soils over sandstone or basalt. Its range extends from the Kimberley region of Western Australia, across the top end of the Northern Territory including Bathurst and Melville Islands, and along the coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria as far east as the Gilbert River in Queensland.

It was there that he became known as \\"George\\" when printers misread his scribbled initials on copy sheets as \\"Geo.\\"Griffen-Foley, Bridget (2012). \\"Warnecke, Glen William ('George')\\". Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 18. Melbourne University Press. Online version retrieved 29 September 2016. In 1915 Warnecke enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and served on the Western Front with the 19th Battalion. He had a weak left eye but had passed the medical examination by memorising the sight-testing card. He was wounded twice in 1916 and also diagnosed with shell shock. While convalescing at the AIF hospital in England near the hamlet of Hurdcott, he launched and edited a small review entitled The Hurdcott Herald. On returning to Australia in 1918 he was discharged from the army as medically unfit. Warnecke had kept an extensive diary of his war time experience, described in the Sydney Morning Herald as \\"the story of a young, idealistic patriot transformed by the horrors of World War I into a man old before his time.\\"Roberts, Lydia (18 December 2014). \\"Nationwide search to find relatives of Armidale icon\\". Armidale Express. Retrieved 29 September 2016. His diary entry on his 20th birthday in July 1916 read: > Red and green flares burst like a fountain of joyful fireworks from the > German lines. Other flares, white ones, rose and fell in endless succession. > Machine-guns rattled from a score of points and the crackling of bombs could > be heard. The wounded began to limp back. A man with only half of his face. > Another with broken hands ... We hardly dare ask how the stunt had gone ... > It was a failure all right. =Sydney and Fleet Street= After his discharge from the army, Warnecke resumed his work at The Evening News and became active in the Australian Workers' Union. He went on to become chief-of-staff the newly launched Daily Mail which at the time was aligned with the Labor Party. In 1923 he went to England to open the London office of the Sydney-based Smith's Weekly and its newly launched daily, the Daily Guardian. Despite being well paid, Warnecke found the closed atmosphere on Fleet Street frustrating. However, he found intellectual rewards in London's Bloomsbury quarter where he mixed with Australian writers such as Anna Wickham and Christina Stead and the British communists William Gallacher and Shapurji Saklatvala. He later wrote in his memoirs \\"my eyes were opening, and my ears were listening.\\" Warnecke became an ardent Irish nationalist, serving as secretary of the London branch of the Irish Workers' League and marching with them in the 1924 May Day procession. In London he also met and fell in love with the Irish soprano, Nora Hill. The couple returned to Australia later in 1924 and were married there on 18 October.Griffen-Foley, Bridget (2009). \\"‚ÄòThe crumbs are better than a feast elsewhere‚Äô: Australian journalists on Fleet Street\\" in Carl Bridge, Robert Crawford and David Dunstan (eds.) Australians in Britain: The Twentieth- Century Experience. Monash University ePress. Warnecke served as chief sub- editor of the Daily Guardian from 1926 and became a prot√©g√© of its proprietor R. C. Packer. He was appointed editor of Packer's new Sunday Guardian in 1929 and later became the Editor-in-Chief of Frank Packer's Australian Consolidated Press, responsible for the relaunch of The Daily Telegraph. However, his most enduring achievement during the inter-war years was the founding of The Australian Women's Weekly. Warnecke wrote of his plans: > Give it an unswerving Australian outlook [...] Above all, whether the > journalists are writing about fashion, cookery, baby care or diet there has > to be a element of news in what they write. The Australian Women's Weekly launched in May 1933 with Warnecke as its editor and one of its regular contributors, along with several other prominent journalists and writers. His vision for the magazine as a mass-market, but thought-provoking publication with high production values, made it highly successful. By 1939, its circulation had reached 400,000 copies a week and for its first 50 years it remained the highest selling per capita magazine in the world.Thomas, Deborah and Clements. Kirstie (2014). The Australian Women's Weekly Fashion: The First 50 Years, pp. vi‚Äìvii. National Library of Australia. =American sojourn and post-war Australia= Warnecke's relations with Frank Packer became increasingly strained after 1935 and in April 1939 he resigned from Consolidated Press. He and Nora went to the United States. There he studied printing and magazine methods for The Herald and Weekly Times company owned by Keith Murdoch and wrote regular articles for the Melbourne Herald on US foreign policy and other topics. In 1940 he became a foreign correspondent for the McClure Newspaper Syndicate and in 1943 joined the US Office of War Information as a special writer. Many of his articles from that period were syndicated in Australian newspapers. Warnecke and Nora returned to Australia in 1947 and remained there for the next ten years. He wrote for several newspapers, but no longer worked as an editor. He served as a consultant to Murdoch and tried his hand at publishing which he described to friends as the \\"Intelligent Young Man‚Äôs Guide to Capitalism\\". In 1947 he co-founded Atlas Publications with his fellow journalists Jack Bellew and Clive Turnbull. Atlas published magazines and popular fiction, but was best known for its comic books. The fledgling company achieved a major success in 1948 with its Captain Atom series. Captain Atom was one of the few original Australian comic heroes to have his own merchandising and fan club. At its peak the comic was selling 180,000 copies a month and ran for six years. However Atlas declined in parallel with the decline of the Australian comics industry in the second half of the 1950s. The company ceased publication in 1958. Jack Bellew had died in 1957. That same year Warnecke and Nora moved to Ireland fulfilling a long- standing promise he had made to her. =Final years in Ireland= The Warnecke's settled in Dublin where George became the \\"resident patriarch\\" of the Irish-Australian Society. His last years were increasingly marked by deafness and illness, but he continued writing up until his death. When he died in Dublin's Meath Hospital at the age of 86, he left three books unfinished, his memoirs entitled Miracle Magazine, a work on \\"Australianism, as identified by press, politics and religion\\", and a biography of John Macarthur for which he had received a grant from the Literature Board of the Australia Council. He was buried in Dublin next to Nora who had died in 1969. They had no children.Sydney Morning Herald (5 June 1981). \\"Creative Genius Founded ‚ÄòWeekly‚Äô\\", p. 9 Nora's Australian-born niece Meg Sordello, who had inherited Warnecke's papers and correspondence, donated them to the State Library of New South Wales where they have been held since 2003.State Library of New South Wales. \\"George Warnecke papers, 1907-1981, and related correspondence of Meg Sordello, 1981-1985\\".

He was described by one biographer as a \\"flamboyant personality who seems to have aroused in his contemporaries varying degrees of ridicule, hostility, and admiration\\". Life The eldest son of John Bennett, watchmaker, of Greenwich, he was educated at Colfe's Grammar School, Lewisham. In 1846 he established his own business as a watchmaker at 65 Cheapside, in the City of London. Although trained as a practical watchmaker, Bennett's business at Cheapside was a high street retailer of watches made by English and Swiss watch manufacturers.Pall Mall Gazette - Monday 13 December 1886, pp 1-2. Bennett married Agnes Willson in 1843 and the couple had three children, Alice, John and Juliet.1851 Census return Retrieved 2016-09-29 When Bennett retired, he was noted to be boarding with Aimee Guilbert, a widow. She was, in fact, his long term mistress and bore him seven children; Lillie, Lionel, Violet, Rose, Horace, Gerald Munro and Douglas Thurlow, all of whom took their mother's surname. He retired from business and from the Court of Common Council in 1889, first to Rotherfield, Sussex, and later to St. Leonards-on- Sea on the Sussex coast, where he died in 1897 at the age of 82.https://londonstreetviews.wordpress.com/2013/08/08/john-bennett-clock-and- watchmaker Retrieved 2016-09-29 He was described in an obituary as \\"a man of strong character, very eccentric, and one of the most familiar figures in London\\".https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/07/06/105947994.pdf Retrieved 2016-09-29 The fate of Bennett's estate is uncertain, with two probate records issued. The first granted probate on 1 February 1898 to Henry Hewitt Bridgman with the estate valued at ¬£463 19s. 6d. A second record of 1899 grants probate to Edward Jones Trustram, solicitor, the attorney of Aim√©e Guilbert, spinster. By this second probate, the estate had dwindled to just ¬£88 9s. 6d.England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1898 and 1899 A notice in the London Gazette of 29 September 1899 asking all creditors of the estate to contact Trustram states that Aim√©e Guilbert was named executrix in the will. Bennett was a flamboyant man including in his dress and public appearances. He was reporting as appearing in the Lord Mayor's Show mounted on a white horse whilst dressed in a black velvet jacket and a broad-brimmed hat. The family of his daughter, Alice, described him as ‚Äòabominable‚Äô and ‚Äòsomething of a monster‚Äô. Civic career Bennett was a Liveryman of the Spectaclemakers', Clockmakers' and Loriners' companies, and served as Master of the Loriners in 18778. Bennett was a Common Councilman on the City of London Corporation for the ward of Cheap from 186289. In October 1872 he was elected to the London School Board to fill a casual vacancy in the representation of the City of London. Although he stood down from the school board at the election in 1873, he returned to serve a three-year term from 187679 and he served a further term 18851889. He was a Sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1871 and a Lord Lieutenant of the City of London, and was knighted as part of the celebrations for the recovery of the Prince of Wales from typhoid in the same year. In 1877 he was elected the alderman for Cheap ward, winning by a single vote. It was alleged that eight men who had voted for him had rented property solely to be able to vote and one of those eight admitted as much; the Recorder ruled that this did not invalidate the vote. His opponent then withdrew and Bennett was declared elected. The Court of Aldermen though, declaring him to be \\"not of fit character\\" to hold the office, refused to ratify his appointment. Notwithstanding, the Wardmote returned him twice more. On his third return, the Court of Aldermen declared his opponent duly elected, despite his having fewer votes cast in his favour than Bennett. After this third rejection, Bennett withdrew from the election. He unsuccessfully stood for parliament on three occasions; Greenwich (1873), Maldon (1874) and Wiltshire (1886).

In that regard, France has been at the forefront of Open Data in Europe. Civic groups like Wikimedia France, Open Street Map France, Libertic or Regards Citoyens had been lobbying for Open Data for many years before public administrations took action. Amongst public administrations, some cities pioneered the change: Rennes, then Paris thanks to the decision taken by the municipal council on June 8, 2010 relative to the publication of public data and the \\"Paris Data\\" portal made public on January 27, 2011. The inter-ministerial Task Force \\"\\", under the authority of the Prime Minister, is in charge of creating and updating the portal for public Open Data data.gouv.fr , which has been made available since December 5, 2011 and hosts more than 19,000 datasets. The role of Chief Data Officer in the French public administration was created by decree of September 16, 2014. The Chief Data Officer's attributions were specified so that \\"He/she may request from administrations that they hand over the inventory of the data they produce, receive, or collect. He/she shall hand in to the Prime Minister a yearly report on the inventory, the governance, the production, the dissemination and the use of data by administrations. Finally, he/she is authorized to conduct experimentations on the use of data, to reinforce the efficiency of public policies, to contribute to a better management of public spending and resources, and to improve the quality of public services provided to citizens.\\" The Open Data Barometer, a project of the Web Foundation, had France ranked 10th in 2013, 4th in 2014 and 2d in 2015. The Open Knowledge Foundation created in 2013 the Open Data Index which compares data availability across countries in which France was ranked 16th in 2013, 3rd in 2014 and 10th in 2015.  Legal framework  = Laws applicable in France and public data =  Founding principles of Open data  The right to access public data is inscribed in the Declaration of rights of man and of the citizen of 1789, under the article XV which mentions that \\"The society has the right of requesting account from any public agent of its administration.\\" According to the preamble of the Constitution of the French Fifth Republic (adopted on 4 October 1958, and the current constitution), the principles set forth in the Declaration have constitutional value today.  Law on the liberty of access to administrative documents (1978)  Law 78-753 of July 17, 1978 on the liberty of access to public information in France (for the most part abrogated in 2015) did not require public administrations to publish their numerical data, nor to proactively publish information. Nonetheless, it implemented a cornerstone for open public data by broadly and precisely defining administrative documents as \\"whatever their date, their place of conservation, their type or their support, the documents produced or received, within their exercise of the public tasks, by the State, the territorial collectivities and the other legal persons under public law or the legal persons under private law tasked with such public tasks. Are constitutive of such documents files, reports, studies, minutes of meetings and proceedings, statistics, directives, instructions, circulars, notes and ministerial responses, correspondence, notices, previsions and decisions.\\" It required administrative documents that were not under elaboration to be communicated to \\"those who asked for it\\".  European directive of 2003  In 2003, directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 details the conditions for use of public sector information. It is transposed into French law in 2005, so as to facilitate the use of existing documents or data held by public organizations.  Decree of 2011  In 2011, the decree 2011-577 of May 26 relative to the re-use of public sector information sets forth the principle of gratuity of re-use of public sector data and documents. Under this decree, an administrative agency may consider applying licence fees to the re-use of the State's immaterial property such as data, but this decision must be published by decree after consultation of the Public edition and Administrative Information Council.  Bill on a Digital Republic  The bill was jointly prepared with Internet users before being submitted to the Council of State and adopted by the Council of Ministers. It was adopted on January 26, 2016. It moved forward the access to public data by: * widening the online publication of administrative documents. This will limit the communication on demand of administrative documents, made universally available on the Internet; * stating the principle according to which public information that has been communicated or made public will be freely re-usable for other purposes than the public tasks for which they were produced or received; * introducing the notion of general interest data making private companies in charge of a public tasks clearly fall under the administrative document and public information regime.  Data on energy  In order to implement at their level the law on Energy Transition, many agents including territorial collectivities and citizens need access to updated and precise data on the production of energy and the effective consumption of energy by building, neighborhood, city, etc. while abiding by the rules on the protection of private data. The law on Energy Transition has those data become progressively accessible online for free re-use by any party (open data). The network operators (electricity, gas, heat and coal networks) and the providers of fuel products must provide certain data to the Statistics service of the Ministry of Energy every year by the June 30. These will be in turn published online within two months (before September 1). Legal provisions have been made through three decrees published in 2016 relative to the confidentiality of some information. = Licences = Under French law, public data is likely to contain sensitive information, either because it allows the identification of a person, or because it is subject to copyright, State secret or considerations of national defense. In this context, data must at the very least be made anonymous before being published. Once the publication rights are clear, licences will apply. Various organizations have elaborated free licences applicable to all types of content and audiences. These are templates and need not be conformed to. In France, up to five different licences for data re-use have been set fort. In 2013, the harmonization of practices has led to two equally used licences: the Licence Ouverte and the Open Database Licence.  Licence Ouverte  This licence created by ETALAB, the French Prime Minister's task force for Public Data is meant to be used widely in France. The website data.gouv.fr operates under this licence.  Open Database License (ODbL)  The ODbL licence has been translated into French by the city of Paris so as to adapt it to a national use. A variety of projects have been using this licence, from Open Street Map to local authorities (Paris, Nantes, Toulouse...).

The accident occurred during the morning rush hour, at one of the busiest transportation hubs in the New York metropolitan area. The events leading up to the crash remain unclear but are being investigated. One person died, and 114 others were injured. The train operator, who was in the cab car, was among the injured. Background NJ Transit is the third-busiest commuter railroad in the United States. Before the 2016 crash, the last fatal incident on the railroad was the 1996 Secaucus train collision. NJ Transit had been under audit by the Federal Railroad Administration since June 2016, before the crash. The probe was prompted by an increase in safety violations and led to federal citations of the agency. Accident Cab car #6036 resting against the terminal wall after the crash Pascack Valley Line train #1614 left the Spring Valley station in Spring Valley, New York, at 7:23 a.m. EDT, bound for Hoboken. Entering the Hoboken terminal around 8:45 a.m., the train went over the bumper block and through the rail concourse, coming to rest at the wall right before the station's waiting area. The cab car sustained major structural damage. One witness reported that the train \\"never slowed down\\" as it entered the station, which is located at the end of the line. The train involved in the crash reportedly did not have an automatic brake system using positive train control (PTC), which is used to slow the train in case the engineer does not apply the brake in time. It is unclear whether PTC would have prevented the crash. Train #1614 consisted of four NJ Transit Comet V passenger cars (cab car #6036 and 3 coaches) and one NJT GP40PH-2B locomotive (#4214). Train #1614 was a local, making all stops on the Pascack Valley Line. Comet V Cab Car #6036 was leading the train at the time of the accident, with locomotive #4214 pushing from the rear. =Casualties= Damaged cab car The accident caused one death and injured at least 114 other people. The Jersey City Medical Center treated 66 people for injuries from the crash; 53 of these were released from the hospital by the afternoon following the crash. The Hoboken University Medical Center treated 23 patients and the Christ Hospital treated one patient; of these all but two were released by the evening following the crash. The lone fatality, a woman standing on the platform, was killed by falling debris. The victim was identified as attorney Fabiola Bittar de Kroon, 34, a married mother of one and native of Brazil who had recently moved to Hoboken. The majority of those injured were passengers on the crashed train. =Impact= Collapsed portions of the station roof after the crash Initial eyewitness reports indicated that portions of the station roof collapsed, as did part of the roof of the train shed, and that water was spraying from the site of the accident. Major structural damage to the station was reported. Following the accident, rail service to and from the Hoboken station (including PATH service) was suspended, and local buses and ferries, as well as Metro-North Railroad, were cross-honoring NJ Transit train tickets. PATH service was suspended due to fears that the roof of the PATH station, where the derailed NJ Transit train came to rest, might collapse. PATH service into and out of the station was restored by the end of the day, as was Hudson-Bergen Light Rail service in and out of the station. Delays to rail service in the area persisted into the following week. Investigation NTSB Vice Chairman Bella Dinh-Zarr and other NTSB employees outside Hoboken terminal The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the accident. An NTSB \\"go team\\" was sent to the scene, and the Federal Railroad Administration also dispatched investigators. Although injured, the train engineer cooperated with the investigation, and both the engineer and the train conductor were interviewed by investigators. The engineer lacked any memory of the accident itself. According to the federal investigators, the engineer \\"felt well rested and was unaware of any mechanical problems in the moments before the accident.\\" Among other things, the NTSB investigation will attempt to determine whether or not positive train control could have prevented the accident. The day following the crash, investigators retrieved one of the two train event recorders (black boxes) from the wreckage, but it was unusable. The second black box was successfully recovered in the first week of October 2016. On October 6, 2016, the NTSB released its findings based on the event recorder and video recorders. According to its report, 38 seconds prior to the crash, the train's engineer accelerated from 8 mph and was traveling at 21 mph on impact, more than twice the speed limit of 10 mph. The engineer attempted the emergency braking procedure less than a second before the crash. On October 6, 2016, the train was removed from the station area for further investigation. In November 2016, attorney Jack Arsenault said his client, the train engineer Thomas Gallagher, suffered from severe sleep apnea which was undiagnosed until after the crash. NJ Transit has a sleep apnea screening program but, despite that, a physical exam in July 2016 had cleared Gallagher for duty. Gallagher, aged 48 and with 18 years experience as a train engineer, said he had no memory of the crash and was lying on the cab floor when he woke up after the impact. An official briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press under condition of anonymity that the investigation is considering sleep apnea as a possible cause of the crash. Hoboken Terminal has the original steel-and-concrete bumpers from when it was opened in 1907. It is believed newer bumpers with hydraulic shock absorbers and sled-like friction shoes would have reduced the impact. Aftermath Following the train crash, New Jersey Transit issued new regulations requiring that engineers must be accompanied by at least one other crew member as they pull a train into Hoboken Station. In addition NJ Transit also mandated a reduction in the approaching speed limit into the train station from 10 miles per hour to 5 miles per hour. The Hoboken Terminal remained closed until October 10, when a limited number of platforms were reopened with a modified service schedule. Full service was not restored until October 17; Tracks 5 and 6, where the train crashed, remained closed while repairs were carried out. Similar accidents A similar accident occurred at the same station in December 1985, injuring 54 people. The 1985 crash was said to have been caused by a lubricant that had been applied to the tracks to test train wheels. In May 2011, a PATH train crashed in the basement of Hoboken Terminal, causing minor injuries. Investigators said that they will look into the possibility that the 2011 and 2016 accidents may have similar causes and circumstances. The December 2013 Spuyten Duyvil derailment was attributed to sleep apnea, which is a suspected factor in the 2016 Hoboken crash.

It resembles nodaviruses (family Nodaviridae), but has yet to be formally classified.Orsay virus. Virus-Host DB Orsay virus has a (+)ssRNA genome consisting of two segments, termed RNA1 and RNA2. The RNA1 segment encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of 982 amino acids.Guo, Y.R., et al., Crystal structure of a nematode-infecting virus. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2014. 111(35): p. 12781‚Äì12786. The RNA2 segment has two open reading frames (ORFs) that code for a capsid protein and a non-structural protein with unknown function. The virus is composed of two structural domains, a shell (S) and a protrusion (P) domain. The Orsay virus was discovered in 2011 in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes in rotting fruit in Orsay, France. Just before the time of the discovery, standardized methods were developed for the wild isolation of nematodes. Using these methods, Caenorhabditis briggsae and C. elegans nematodes were found that displayed abnormalities in the intestines, such as extensive convolutions of the apical intestinal border.F√©lix, M.-A., et al., Natural and experimental infection of Caenorhabditis nematodes by novel viruses related to nodaviruses. PLoS Biol, 2011. 9(1): p. e1000586. The lysate of infected nematodes was added to healthy nematodes, which led to infection. Since for the lysate a filter was used that only allows virus particles to penetrate, this suggested that a virus was the cause of the intestinal abnormalities. Electron microscopy showing viral particles confirmed the role of a virus. On infection of a susceptible nematode, the viral particles are mainly localized to intestinal cells.Franz, C.J., et al., Orsay, Santeuil and Le Blanc viruses primarily infect intestinal cells in Caenorhabditis nematodes. Virology, 2014. 448: p. 255‚Äì264. The small structure of the Orsay virus, its resemblance to the well-studied nodaviruses and its tropism to intestinal cells of C. elegans, together with its lack of infectivity for humans, make the Orsay virus a useful virus for studying host‚Äìvirus interactions.

The modern building comprises a chapel, community rooms and a home for residents with disabilities. History The origins of St Matthias Church in Canning town are found in 1887 with a gospel mission from St Mary's Church, Plaistow. It was named after St Matthias' Church in Torquay, which had assisted with funding the mission. In 1906 the mission merged with that of St Cyprian on Beaconsfield Road. In 1907 a permanent church building was built and a parish formed. This parish contained sections of the parish of St Mary's, St Andrew's and St Gabriel's. In 1961 parts of the parish of Holy Trinity and more from St Gabriel's were added. With the three churches of St Mary's Church, St Martin‚Äôs, and St Philip and St James‚Äô, it formed part of the Parish of the Divine Compassion. By 1989 the original church building was demolished and replaced in 1991 by an integrated chapel, community rooms and home for residents with disabilities. Present day In 2016, St Matthias' Church received a planted congregation from neighbouring church All Hallows Bow at the invitation of the Bishop of Barking.

Fourteen-year-old Jesse Osborne shot three students and a teacher, critically wounding six-year- old student Jacob Hall, who died from his injuries three days later. Osborne, who also shot and killed his father before the shooting, was arrested as the sole suspect and charged with murder and attempted murder. Details The shooting started before 1:45 p.m., when Osborne drove into a fence of Townville Elementary School in a black pickup truck, got out of the vehicle and began firing into the air near the school's playground with a .40-caliber pistol, repeatedly shouting, \\"I hate my life.\\" He then jumped the fence and began firing at students. Police received a 9-1-1 call on the shooting at 1:44 p.m. At around 2:00 p.m., the suspect was apprehended by a volunteer firefighter after his gun jammed on the playground, just 12 seconds after he first pulled the trigger. According to Osborne during his interview with the police, he threw his gun and his vest away after realizing he was ‚Äúgoing to hell‚Äù and called his paternal grandparents in tears to confess what he had done. A body, later identified as the suspect's father, was later discovered at the family home by the Osborne's grandmother. The \\"unintelligible\\" call from her grandson prompted her to go to the home to investigate. One student was shot in the foot and a female teacher was shot in the shoulder; both were treated at AnMed Health and released the following evening. Another student suffered a superficial wound that did not require medical treatment. A third student, six-year-old Jacob Hall, suffered a gunshot wound to the leg, which led to massive blood loss and then cardiac arrest. He was airlifted to Greenville Memorial Hospital and underwent surgery. Hall died on October 1, three days after having been shot. A funeral for Hall was held on October 5. Perpetrator Jesse Osborne, (born September 1, 2002) ‚Äî fourteen years old at the time of the shooting ‚Äî was identified as the suspected gunman. He had attended Townville Elementary School through fifth grade and was known to be sociable and someone who did well in classes. At the time of the shooting, he was being homeschooled after being expelled from middle school for bringing in a hatchet and a machete earlier in the year of the shooting. On February 16, 2018, Judge Edgar H Long made the decision to waive Osborne, 15 years old at the time, out of Family Court and up to General Sessions Court where he will be tried as an adult. Osborne was charged with two counts of murder, three counts of attempted murder and five counts of possessing a weapon. By U.S. federal statues, Osborne faced up to life in prison without parole. On September 7, 2018, Osborne pled not guilty on all counts before a South Carolina Supreme Court Judge. His attorney, however, publicly hinted at the possibility of a plea deal. Several witnesses were called forward over the following two months, including an investigator who testified that Osborne had been influenced by an online chat-group of people ‚Äúobsessed‚Äù with mass shootings, some of whom encouraged Osborne to commit one. Prior testimony from the investigator revealed that Osborne had been planning an attack for months through his internet searches, constituting premeditation. But on December 12 of that year, Osborne did plead guilty to the five counts of murder and attempted murder, waiving his right to a jury trial. His attorney stated that it was in his client‚Äôs best interest that he plead guilty rather than go through a trial. Sentencing was postponed to a later date to allow Judge R. Lawton McIntosh to appropriately decide Osborne‚Äôs fate, given that he was set to serve a minimum of thirty years and a maximum of life without parole. Jacob Hall‚Äôs father was in the court gallery during Osborne‚Äôs guilty plea, as was Osborne's aunt. Jacob's mother did not attend the hearing, as she was incarcerated following her drug arrest less than a month before the plea. Osbourne was tried as an adult, and on November 13, 2019, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the murder of Jacob Hall and 30 years for the attempted murder charges.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/12/12/jesse-osborne- pleads-guilty-south-carolina-school-shooting/2297747002/ Osborne's trial records his lawyer said he will try to appeal his sentence.

The cascading failure of the electricity transmission network resulted in almost the entire state losing its electricity supply, affecting 850,000 SA customers. Kangaroo Island did not lose its supply, as the Kangaroo Island power station had been built to supply the island for the contingency of a failure in the power cable under the Backstairs Passage. Storms On the day of the failure, South Australia experienced a violent storm reported as being a once-in-50-year event. There was gale force and storm force wind across wide areas of the state. It included at least two tornadoes in the vicinity of Blyth, which damaged multiple elements of critical infrastructure. The state was hit by at least 80,000 lightning strikes. The wind damaged a total of 23 pylons on electricity transmission lines, including damage on three of the four interconnectors connecting the Adelaide area to the north and west of the state. Power grid The South Australian power grid is operated by ElectraNet and connected to the National Electricity Market via two interconnectors to Victoria. These are the Heywood interconnector (recently upgraded to 650 MW at 275 kV)Fact sheet, Heywood interconnector in the southeast of the state and the Murraylink (220 MW at 150 kV) HVDC further north, connecting Berri to Red Cliffs in Victoria. The Heywood interconnector had been down for upgrade earlier in the year, and was initially blamed for the widespread outage. Blackout The weather had resulted in localised power outages throughout the day and by around 3:50 p.m. local time, almost the entire state power grid had been cut out. Early indications were that as the transmission lines in the Mid North failed due to damaged pylons, the automatic safety features in the network isolated the generators to protect both the generation facilities and the end consumers' equipment. Over a short period, this resulted in most of the state's distribution network being powered down as the transmission network acted to protect the infrastructure. The preliminary report from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) identified that problems started 90 seconds before the eventual failure. The first line to trip was a 66 kV line near Adelaide, and it was automatically reset. The first major fault was 47 seconds later when two phases of the 275 kV line between Brinkworth and Templers grounded. The Davenport‚ÄìBelalie line tripped with one phase to ground, was automatically reset, but tripped again nine seconds later, so was isolated for manual inspection, with the fault estimated to be from Davenport. One second later (7 seconds before the state went dark), the Hallett Wind Farm reduced output by 123 MW. Four seconds later, a third 275 kV transmission line showed a fault, the Davenport‚ÄìMount Lock is on the other side of the same towers as Davenport‚ÄìBelalie, and the fault was estimated to be further on. The damaged power lines caused 5‚Äì6 voltage glitches which stressed the ride- through capability of most of the wind farm capacity, causing nine of them to shut down: Finally, all within one second, the Hornsdale Wind Farm reduced output by 86 MW, Snowtown Wind Farm reduced output by 106 MW, the Heywood interconnector flow increased to over 850 MW and both of its circuits tripped out due to the overload. Supply was then lost to the entire South Australian region of the National Electricity Market, as the Torrens Island Power Station, Ladbroke Grove Power Station, Murraylink interconnector and all remaining wind farms tripped. AEMO identified software settings in the wind farms that prevented repeated restarts once voltage or frequency events occurred too often. The group of wind turbines that could accept 9 ride- throughs in 120 seconds stayed on line through much of the event before the system went black. The rather larger group of turbines that could not accept this many repeated ride-throughs dropped out, instigating the overload and shutdown of the interconnector, and hence the electricity supply. AEMO has suggested better fault ride-through capability for the wind farms. The high wind speed caused 20 MW of wind power to disconnect to prevent overspeed. In 2019, the Australian Energy Regulator initiated proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia against the operators of four wind farms. It alleged that these companies had failed to comply with performance requirements to ride through major disruptions and disturbances. The companies AGL Energy, Neoen, Pacific Hydro and Tilt Renewables operated several of the large wind farms that tripped during the incident including Hallett, Hornsdale, Clements Gap and Snowtown. Restoration As so much of the network had been shut down, the authorities needed to act carefully to bring it back online and provide a stable network. This was initiated in the first few hours following the start of the outage, initially using the Victorian interconnectors to establish a stable frequency on the network, and gradually add South Australia's power generators to the network and restore power to areas as soon as possible. The initial focus was to restore power to the Adelaide metropolitan area, and suburbs started to regain power within about three hours, and much of the city power was restored by 10 p.m. By the following morning, power had been restored to most of the areas of Adelaide and the areas south and east of it that did not have storm damage to the distribution network. The substantial damage to the transmission network north of Adelaide meant that large areas of the Mid North and Eyre Peninsula did not have power restored within 24 hours, and further damaging weather indicated that it could be at least the end of the weekend before some of those areas were restored. AEMO had contracts with two \\"System Restart Ancillary Services\\" (SRAS) providers to help bring the network back up. The Mintaro Emergency Diesel Generator had suffered storm damage, including a cloud-to-ground lightning strike in very close proximity, but would not have been useful anyway due to its location in the network and downed transmission lines. The Quarantine Power Station was unable to start the larger Unit #5 required to provide enough power to restart any of the Torrens Island Power Station units, so Torrens Island needed power from the Victorian interconnector to be restarted. A circuit breaker in the Quarantine Power Station switchyard connecting Torrens Island Power Station and the smaller units at Quarantine Power Station with Unit #5 tripped repeatedly due to in-rush current on the generator transformer and auxiliary transformer, and subsequently ran out of stored energy before Unit #5 could be started. By the morning of Friday 30 September 2016, about 10,000 properties had not yet had power restored since the blackout on Wednesday afternoon, and 18,000 more had lost power due to distribution network faults caused by continued stormy weather. An additional transmission line fault near Tumby Bay was only detected as ElectraNet tried to power up the system, and this fault prevented the power generator in Port Lincoln from being used to power the lower Eyre Peninsula. Due to the extensive nature of the damage, temporary transmission towers were sent by Western Power; these towers can reach a height of 58 metres and take only one day to erect. It is expected that the towers will remain in use for 6 to 12 months while the permanent repairs are made. Consequences The Flinders Medical Centre, a major hospital in Adelaide's southern suburbs, was affected when the fuel pump for the diesel-powered back- up generator failed after operating for about an hour. As a result, 17 patients were transferred from the intensive care unit to the adjacent Flinders Private Hospital, which still had an operating generator. Several embryos were also lost at Flinders Fertility. The zinc smelter operated by Nyrstar at Port Pirie was expected to be shut down for several weeks, as the diesel back-up generator failed after about four hours, and the content of the smelter cooled and solidified. Immediate political responses A number of politicians commented whilst the emergency was unfolding. The Australian Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce told ABC \\"[Windpower] wasn't working too well last night, because they had a blackout\\", while the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said state governments had paid \\"little or no attention to energy security.\\" Energy minister Josh Frydenberg said that \\"energy security was the (federal) government's \\"number one priority\\". He later said \\"it has to be underlined that this was a major weather event.\\" South Australian senator Nick Xenophon said he supported renewable energy but that the state's approach relied too much on wind. South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill said Xenophon had \\"jumped the shark\\" as the situation was yet to be analysed. Queensland One Nation senator, Malcolm Roberts urged all governments to \\"exit all climate change policies\\" while South Australian Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said it was \\"pathetic\\" that people were politicking while emergency service officers and volunteers are flat out responding. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten accused the Coalition of \\"playing politics with what is a natural disaster\\" and that there was no link between the storm damage and the state's renewable energy target. The Grattan Institute's Tony Wood was reported as saying \\"If you've got a wind farm or a coal-fired power station at the end of a transmission line, and that system either is taken out by a storm or is forced to shut down to protect itself from a storm, it doesn't matter what the energy source is\\" while Clean Energy Council's Tom Butler said the weather event \\"created a fault in the system which has caused the generation to trip offline\\" and that \\"the Snowtown wind farm, north of Adelaide, was actually helping to prop up the state's power supply ahead of gas power stations as the network was gradually brought back online.\\" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews told ABC radio that Turnbull had conflated two issues, that \\"the poles and wires had blown over\\".  Ensuing flood  Following the power outages, the same storm resulted in major flooding, which was dubbed \\"unrelenting\\" by South Australia Services Minister Peter Malinauskas. A flood emergency was issued for towns and suburbs north of Adelaide. Flood warnings were also issued for the Adelaide hills area.  December 2016 blackouts  Further widespread blackouts occurred beginning late on Tuesday 27 December 2016, with areas losing power for upwards of twelve hours following severe storms causing damage to over 300 powerlines in the electricity distribution network. The storms also caused flooding and wind damage, including property destruction due to fallen trees. A total of 155,000 properties lost power at the peak of the storms, requiring over 1200 repair jobs resulting from over 350 powerlines being damaged. As of 7.30pm on Thursday 29 December, there were more than 11 500 households still without power across the state, some for up to forty-six hours, in regions including the Adelaide Hills, Mid-North, Flinders Ranges, and Murraylands.https://outage.apps.sapowernetworks.com.au/outagereport/outagesearch?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 By 9am on Saturday 31 December, there were still more than 1600 households without power for more than 80 hours, primarily across the Adelaide Hills. February 2017 blackouts On 8 February 2017, over 90,000 households in Adelaide lost power for 45 minutes in the middle of a major heatwave. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) ordered 100 MW of load shedding, but 300 MW was cut, causing controversy with the state government. The state Energy Minister, Tom Koutsantonis said that the state had spare generation capacity but the market didn't turn that generation on, as the 165 MW second unit at Pelican Point power station had gas and was ready to go.Rolling blackouts ordered as Adelaide swelters in heatwave (News.com.au)SA power crisis: Will there be more blackouts? AEMO stated that it had sent notices to all generators, requesting a market response due to increased demand but it did not receive sufficient bids into the market to maintain the supply/demand balance in South Australia. Engie, the operator of Pelican Point, responded that the Market Rules did not permit it to make a market response unless directed by the market operator. This was authorised the next day to avoid a repeat on 9 February. The owner later clarified that it was not allowed to bid into the market if supply cannot be guaranteed, and it did not have a current gas supply contract for the second unit.

Some of her notable works have explored the issue of lesbian first love, including a 2014 graphic novel, published in French as J'aime les filles by L'Oie de Cravan and in English as On Loving Women by Drawn & Quarterly. J'aime les filles was adapted as a 2016 National Film Board of Canada animated short, I Like Girls (J'aime les filles), which received the Nelvana Grand Prize for Independent Short at the 40th Ottawa International Animation Festival. Comic books Obomsawin's works has been described as complex contemporary comics that often have emotionally charged subjects depicted in clear and accessible manner. An example is Kaspar (2007), which is based on the story of Kaspar Hauser, a German boy raised without human contact. This story, which had previously inspired a film by Werner Herzog, was noted for its different portrait of Hauser as a kind of forsaken everyman, a metaphor for the romantic artist and outsider with the protagonist's depiction that focused on Hauser's naive befuddlement with the world. On Loving Women, which was translated into English by Helge Dascher, tackles biography (and autobiography) through a series of vignettes that explore memories ‚Äî crucial moments in the subject's discovery of their sexual identity.

One key game that followed this was their 2014 title Fibbage, which was designed to be a game allowing eight players to play against each other simultaneously aided by the use of one of the players using live streaming of their game or with people in the same room. Other players would participate by using a web browser or mobile device to connect to the streaming player's game through Jackbox's servers and which to provide their answers. With the success of Fibbage, Jackbox Games decided that they could offer these games in packs, reworking older games to use the streaming capabilities and adding in new titles. This formed the basis of the Jackbox Party Pack, with the first pack released in 2014 including updated versions of You Don't Know Jack, Fibbage, a reworked version of Lie Swatter for its multiplayer approach, and two new games. The company saw this as a new development model that allowed them to provide new packs on an annual basis, play around with different game formats, and provide higher value to consumers over one-off titles. Subsequent Jackbox Party Packs have included improvements of existing games, support for more players including the addition of audience participation through the same connectivity approach, better support for content management for streams (as to remove offensive terms in responses, for example), and the ability to create custom games. A key part of the games for the Party Packs was to streamline the ability for players to get into games, and according to Jackbox Games' CEO Mike Bilder, they spent about a year working on building their servers and software to provide a flexible architecture for the player-side mobile/web interface to expand for any of their games, and to avoid having players download any type of app to get started. According to Allard Laban, creative chief for both Jellyvision Labs and Jackbox Games, they select games to include in the packs through a combination of allowing the team to submit fleshed-out ideas, and through testing various ideas through pen-and-paper trials; Laban stated that for the 4th pack, they had over fifty play-tested concepts which they narrowed down to four new games, rounding out the package with an improved version of Fibbage. Some games, such as Fakin' It, took multiple years to get the right gameplay and mechanics down to make it an appropriate game for inclusion. Gameplay An example game screen, this from Quiplash 2 in the 3rd pack. Two players' responses are shown and the other players (listed at the top of each reply) have voted for their favorite response. The game screen shows the \\"room code\\" to allow others to join in as audience members at any time. Most games in The Jackbox Party Pack are designed for online play, requiring only one person to own and launch the game. Remaining players can be local and thus see the game via the first player's computer or console, or can be remote, watching the game be played through streaming media services. All players ‚Äì whether local or remote ‚Äì use web-enabled devices, including personal computers and mobile or tablet devices, to enter a provided \\"room code\\" at Jackbox's dedicated servers to enter the game. Games are generally limited to around 8 active players, but any other players connecting to the room after these players are connected become audience participants, who can impact how scoring is determined and influence the winner. Each game generally has a period where all players are given a type of prompt. This prompt appears on the individual devices and gives players sufficient time to enter their reply or draw as necessary, and can be set to account for forced streaming delays that some streaming services require. The game then collects and processes all the replies, and frequently then gives players a chance to vote for the best answer or drawing; this is often where the audience may also participate by voting as a group. Games proceed for a number of rounds, and a winner, generally with the highest score at the end, is announced. Games All games are available on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PC/Mac/Linux, Apple TV, iPad, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Nvidia Shield TV, and Xfinity X1, with Party Packs 1 and 2 also being available on PlayStation 3. = The Jackbox Party Pack (2014) = The Jackbox Party Pack was released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on November 19, 2014, and for Microsoft Windows on November 26, 2014.

The Nintendo Switch version was released on August 17, 2017. ;You Don't Know Jack 2015 :1-4 Players :Based on the standard format for You Don't Know Jack games, four players are tasked to answer multiple choice trivia questions presented obscurely in the game's \\"high culture meets pop culture\\" format. Players score points in the form of money for answering correctly and in a shorter amount of time and lose money for wrong answers. Multiplayer games also feature \\"screws,\\" where one player can force another player to answer immediately and can earn a bonus if the \\"screwed\\" player answers incorrectly. The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game. ;Drawful :3-8 Players :Drawful is a drawing game. Each round starts with each player individually given a playful phrase and a drawing canvas on their local device. They have a short amount of time to draw out that phrase. Following this, each picture is presented to all players, and the other players must enter a phrase they think the picture represents. Then, all those replies, along with the actual phrase for that picture, are presented to the players to make their vote of what they think the original phrase was. The artist of the picture gets points for every vote that guessed their original phrase, while those who wrote other phrases get points for votes their phrase gets. ;Word Spud :2-8 Players :Word Spud is a word association game. A word is presented and one player, at a time, comes up with a word that is associated with it. The remaining players vote if the association is good or not. From there, the next player starts from the new word to come up with a new association, and the game continues. The player with the most votes for their associations wins. ;Lie Swatter :1-100 Players :A multiplayer version of the single-player mobile app that Jackbox Games released earlier, Lie Swatter challenges up to 100 players to correctly guess if presented trivia statements are true or not, \\"swatting\\" those that are false. Players earn points for correct answers and lose points for incorrect ones. ;Fibbage XL :2-8 Players :Fibbage XL expands on the original Fibbage with more potential questions. Each round of the game, a player selects from one of five random categories, and an obscure fact is presented to all players with a missing word or phrase to complete it. Each player uses their local device to enter a reply for those missing words; if they enter the actual right answer, they are asked to enter something different. Then, the game presents all replies, including the correct one, to the players, who then select what they think is the right answer. Players score points for selecting the right answer, but can also score if other players select their reply, so players are encouraged to provide seemingly correct answers for their replies. The player with the most points at the end of all rounds is the winner. = The Jackbox Party Pack 2 (2015) = The Jackbox Party Pack 2 was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on October 13, 2015.

One player is selected as the judge and is given a choice of two categories. The category is presented to the other players, and these players are each given six random sound effects. Each player then selects two of the sound effects, in order, as a reply to the category. The judge player selects which combined sounds make the most humorous or fitting answer, and that selected player wins a point. The first player to three points wins the game. ;Bidiots :3-6 Players :Bidiots is described as a spiritual successor to Drawful, playable by up to 6 people. At the start of the game, each player draws two simple pieces of art according to randomly selected categories, though these categories may be thematically related and result in similar visuals (for example, \\"going to the beach\\", \\"getting a tan\\", and \\"sunburn\\"). During the game, each player has a starting pool of in-game money which is used in an auction-style format to purchase the art. During the auction, each work is randomly assigned a secret monetary value based on the category, with those works drawn for that category having the highest value; the game will randomly send hints to players on the nature of this information. Players attempt to bid and purchase the art that matches the given category name while trying to use the auction format to goad other bidders to purchase the art they made in the wrong category. Players have \\"screws\\" as in You Don't Know Jack to force another player to bid, and if a player runs low on money, they can take out a predatory loan that will cost points at the end of the game. At the end of the game, the player with the most money, gained by buying low and selling high, wins. ;Quiplash XL :3-8 Players :Quiplash had been developed as a standalone game prior to the pack, and was included in this pack's release along with previous DLC (Quip Pack 1) and \\"over 100 brand new prompts\\". In the game's first two rounds, each player is given two prompts to provide an answer to; the prompts are given so that two players see each prompt. Players provide what they believe is a funny answer to each prompt. Then, all players are shown a prompt and the two answers provided. They vote for the answer they think is the best quip. Each vote gains points for the player that wrote the quip, with a possible \\"quiplash\\" and bonus points if they get all the votes. In the final round, \\"The Last Lash,\\" all players respond to the same prompt, and vote three times for the best answers of those presented. The player with the most points at the end is the winner. ;Bomb Corp. :1-4 Players :Bomb Corp. has one player as an employee of a bomb factory that must deactivate inadvertently-started bombs as they come off the assembly lines, while other players are given different sets of instructions to help deactivate it. The instructions are specifically obtuse and potentially conflicting, requiring careful communication between players. = The Jackbox Party Pack 3 (2016) = The Jackbox Party Pack 3 was released during the week of October 18, 2016 for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and PlayStation 4, Xbox One, certain Android devices, and Apple TV.

Each round includes a multiple-choice trivia question, with players earning in-game money for being correct, and then a subsequent mini-game if any \\"living\\" player got the question wrong. These mini-games take place on \\"The Killing Floor\\", where the loser (or multiple losers) of the mini-game are \\"killed\\" off and become ghosts. Ghosts still participate through the rest of the game. The mini-games range from random luck, challenges against themselves and the other players, or psychological games like a prisoner's dilemma choice. The audience collectively plays as a ghost. :The game proceeds for at least 5 rounds, and no more than 10, until only one player remains alive; if more players are alive after 10 rounds, players subsequently spin the \\"Loser Wheel\\" which has a high chance of killing them, until only one player is left. :The last alive player then attempts to escape by moving across a set of spaces by correctly determining if two presented terms fit into a given category, moving one space for each correct answer. After the first turn, ghosts, including the audience, also begin to answer the same question, but have three terms instead of two, offering the possibility of catching up to the lead. If they surpass the leader, they possess that body, becoming the \\"living\\" player. Once the \\"living\\" player passes a final space, the game is over. ;Guesspionage :2-8 Players :Guesspionage has each player, in turn, guess what percentage of people have a certain quality or do a certain activity, such as texting while driving. If there are more than 5 audience members, they are surveyed prior to the turns to get these percentages, otherwise earlier survey results by Jackbox Games are used. Once the current player makes their guess, the other active players can consider if they are higher or lower than the actual value, including opining if they are off by more than a certain amount. Points are scored by the current player based on how close they are (providing that they are 30% or closer to the answer), and by the other players if they guessed correctly in which direction they were off. :In the final round, one question with 9 choices is given, and the players all have to pick what they think are three most popular answers, with points awarded based on the answer's popularity, the player with the most points after that wins. ;Fakin' It :3-6 Players :Fakin' It is a local multiplayer game where each player has their own connected device. In each round one player is randomly selected to be the Faker, and all players except the Faker are given instructions that involve some type of physical action, such as raising a hand or making a face; the Faker is not given this information but instead must figure out from the other players what to do. Each player then attempts to guess who the Faker by their actions, with the round ending if the Faker is guessed correctly by all other players, or successfully escaping, after which points are awarded for if at least one player guesses the Faker correctly, everyone guesses correctly, and/or if the Faker escapes capture in each task out of the number allotted (3 for 4-6 players, 2 for 3 players). After the first round, players may select any action they like. :The final round is always \\"Text You Up\\", where each player answers a number of open-ended questions, while the Faker is given different questions which can have overlapping answers with the questions given to the players (for example, the other players may be asked about a positive trait about themselves, while the Faker would be asked what traits they would look for in a companion.) The player with the most points by the end of the game wins. ;Tee K.O. :3-8 Players :Tee K.O. is a drawing-based game. Each player draws three images of anything they want, though the game provides suggestions to help. Then each player has a chance to enter several short sayings or slogan.

These designs are then put into a one- on-one voting battle with all other players and audience members as to determine the best-voted T-shirt design and the design that had the longest voting streak. A second round of drawing, slogan writing, pairing, and voting is performed. The winning designs from each round are then put against each other to determine the ultimate winning design.

One player receives a question that asks their opinion on a topic. Their answer is taken out of context and sent to another player, who is then told to determine what the reply was in response to as if they were on a specific site, attempting to twist the words as best they can to make the first player look bad. All players are then presented with the pairs of original replies and the guessed topic, and vote on which pairing is the most ridiculous. Each vote earns points for the second player and a smaller number for the first player that provided the reply. The player with the most points at the end is the winner, having \\"survived the Internet\\". ;Monster Seeking Monster :3-7 Players :Monster Seeking Monster has a horror theme where each player is a disguised monster attempting to date other players.

The player with the most hearts at the end wins the game, unless other special conditions are met relating to the player's monster. ;Bracketeering :3-16 Players :Bracketeering is a tournament- style game for up to sixteen players, played across three rounds.

In each round, a start of a doodle is presented to two randomly selected players, and they have a short time to draw atop that; this is done in real time allowing the audience members to provide feedback on either drawing in the form of preselected emoji. After the timer is done, the players and audience vote for which drawing is better, with points awarded to both players based on how many votes they received, as well as an additional bonus based on the emoji votes.

Each player is given a hypothetical scenario with a crucial element missing, and must fill in the blank. Then the situation is presented to the rest of the players, who must decide whether they answer 'yes' or 'no'. The player who completed the situation then receives points based on how evenly the votes were split. The final round, known as the \\"Decisive Dimension\\", gives prompts with two options where the first is already completed. Players complete the second answer and everyone else picks the option. Points are awarded similarly to how they are in the main round, but players can earn extra points if they can predict what a certain player chooses beforehand. The style is reminiscent of 1950s TV shows like The Twilight Zone, featuring a muted color palette and mystery elements. ;Mad Verse City :3-8 Players :Mad Verse City has up to 8 players, as giant robots, trying to out-rap their opponents. In each round, players are given who they are trying to out-rap, and use their device to fill in various prompts given to them.

In each round, all players are given two fill-in-the-blank prompts that describe an everyday problem that may need solving. The problems are shuffled between players who solve them by drawing an invention with a title and a tagline. Players then pitch their invention, either by presenting it themselves in real life or by having the in-game hosts pitch it instead, and everyone funds the invention they like the most. If an invention surpasses the funding limit, the player who pitched the invention not only gets additional funding ($500 in round one and $1,000 in round two), but players who funded the invention get their funding back doubled (players who gave $800 to an invention get $1,600 back).

The game can either be played where the players are given a fake word as a prompt or a fake slang saying. Players create a definition and then vote on their favorite to continue. Players then create a new word as a synonym of the definition, and finally a sentence using that word. ;Push The Button :4‚Äì10 Players :Push The Button takes place on a spaceship, where one or more of the players have been assigned as an alien and the other players, as humans, must eject the aliens before a timer runs out. Each round, one player determines an activity on the ship (such as drawing or writing a response to a question) and selects a number of the other crew to participate. The assigned human players get one prompt, but the aliens get a different one that would likely cause some confusion. The results are shown, and players have the time to determine if any response seems suspicious. In later rounds, alien players have \\"hacks\\" they can use to either get the correct human prompt or send the alien prompt instead to a human player. At any time before the timer runs down, a player can \\"push the button\\" and select the other player(s) they believe are an alien. All other players then vote if they agree or not. In order for the players to be ejected, a unanimous vote must be passed. If any player votes \\"No\\", the game continues. Otherwise, the game reveals if the players were correct or incorrect, with the aliens winning if one of three conditions have been fulfilled: 1. The timer runs out, 2. all human players have pushed the button and have not ejected anyone, or 3. any human player is ejected. Which leads to the alien(s) ejecting all surviving humans. = The Jackbox Party Pack 7 (2020) = A seventh Pack was released on October 15, 2020.

C. Harrington, or \\"Pinky\\" to his friends ‚Äî was an American archaeologist best known for his work at Jamestown, Virginia and his contributions to the methodology of historical archaeology. He has been called the \\"father of historical archaeology in America\\".Hume, Ivor No√´l (1994), \\"Roanoke Island: America's First Science Center\\", Colonial Williamsburg: The Journal of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation (Spring issue). Nicknames Born Jean Carl, Harrington later went by J. C. Harrington or \\"Pinky.\\" As he said in an autobiography written for his family, \\"My first name has been a nuisance and annoyance all my life.\\" On Harrington's birth certificate, for example, he was listed as female, which he later corrected. While studying at the University of Chicago, Harrington received the nickname \\"Pinky\\" for his red hair and the bright shade of pink he turned when exposed to the sun. He would be known to his friends and colleagues as \\"Pinky\\" from graduate school onward. Biography =Early life= Harrington was born in Millbrook, Michigan. His mother who was named Patricia and father named Edwards were both teachers, though his father later became a school superintendent. This led Harrington's family to relocate to a series of small Michigan towns, including Scottville, Ypsilanti, Vasser, and Albion, during his youth. =Education= Named \\"Most Likely to Keep Busy\\" by his high school annual, Harrington, following his graduation, completed a two-year pre-engineering program at Albion College while working a series of jobs. He then attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston, where he took courses in the architectural school for a year. Harrington completed his bachelor's degree in architectural engineering at the University of Michigan in 1924. The University of Michigan's architectural engineering program required students to complete an internship or architecture-related research project. To meet this requirement, Harrington spent the summer of 1923 with the School for American Research in Santa Fe, New Mexico, creating measured plan drawings of Spanish mission churches. During the project, Harrington met archaeologist Edgar Lee Hewett and his excavation crew at the Gran Quivira ruins. There Harrington's interest in archaeology began to develop. Harrington returned to New Mexico following his graduation, taking a job with the New Mexico Highway Department and later a mining company. While there, Harrington visited a number of archaeological sites, including Alfred V. Kidder's excavations at what is now Pecos National Historical Park near Pecos, New Mexico. Following his sister's death, Harrington returned east, taking a position with an architect in South Bend, Indiana until it dissolved in 1932. The Great Depression led Harrington to reconsider his career path, and he enrolled as a graduate student in archaeology at the University of Chicago. While at the University of Chicago, Harrington joined an expedition conducting a site survey across the Yucat√°n Peninsula, funded by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. By 1935, Harrington had completed the requirements for a master's degree. Though he passed his written examination for a doctoral degree in 1936, Harrington never wrote a dissertation. =Career= Harrington's background in both architecture and archaeology made him a prime candidate to mediate conflicts that had developed between archaeologists and architects during the National Park Service's excavations at Jamestown, Virginia. Approached by the National Park Service in 1936, Harrington was reluctant to take the position, noting that he was not interested in working for the government or in excavating a site that, archaeologically speaking, was quite young. When the Park Service sent him a form asking about the minimum salary he would accept, Harrington asked for \\"$600 more than he thought he would ever earn.\\" He was offered a position at this salary, and he accepted. While working at Jamestown, Harrington married Virginia Hall Sutton, the first female Ranger ever hired by the National Park Service. Also a student from the University of Chicago, Sutton began as a Ranger Historian at Jamestown in 1937. They married in 1938, and throughout their marriage they worked together on archaeological projects. The Harringtons' first project was to remove the fences sealing the Jamestown excavations from the public and to begin public tours of the site. Harrington completed a report of his work at the May-Hartwell site in 1938, but it was not until 1950 that any of his reports of the Jamestown excavations would be published. This was because the National Park Service envisioned their function as one of preservation and interpretation rather than research. To combat this, the Harringtons and other National Park Service employees founded the Eastern National Park and Monument Association in 1948, which published a number of Pinky's archaeological reports. It also provided funding for publishing postcards and pamphlets detailing the history and archaeology of National Parks and Monuments. The excavations at Jamestown continued until World War II, when Harrington was made Acting Park Superintendent of Colonial Park.SAA Bulletin 16(5): Jean Carl Harrington, 1901-1998 He held this position until 1946, when he went on to become the Eastern Regional Archaeologist for the National Park Service's southeast region in Richmond, Virginia. The projects Harrington managed during his career with the National Park Service included the Jamestown Glass Works, Appomattox Court House, Fort Raleigh in North Carolina, and George Washington's Fort Necessity in Pennsylvania. Harrington retired from his career with the National Park Service in 1965. The Harringtons continued to take part in archaeological work, however, excavating several sites in Nauvoo, Illinois for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and sites on West Point Military Academy's Constitution Island. They also traveled extensively to visit international archaeological and historical sites. Scholarship Harrington contributed largely to the development and legitimization of historical archaeology as a discipline. He published the first summary of the field in 1952 in Archaeology of Eastern United States (edited by J. B. Griffin, pp. 335‚Äì344), entitled \\"Historic Site Archaeology in the United States.\\" This was followed by \\"Archaeology as an Auxiliary Science to American History,\\" published in American Anthropologist in 1955 (57(6, pt. 1):1121-1130), which examined the contributions historical archaeology could make to understanding the recent past. Harrington also published a booklet for the Society for State and Local History, Archaeology and the Historical Society, in 1965. This publication addressed an audience outside the field of archaeology, giving an idea of the types of questions that historical archaeology could address to augment historical research. Both Pinky and Virginia Harrington were involved in the organization of the Society for Historical Archaeology, beginning with its first meeting in 1967. In addition, Harrington's article \\"Dating Stem Fragments of Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Clay Tobacco Pipes,\\" published by the Archaeological Society of Virginia in 1954 (Quarterly Bulletin of the Archaeological Society of Virginia 9(1):10-14), presented a series of histograms that showed bore diameters of pipe stems decreasing over time. This data, converted into a regression formula by Lewis Binford, is still used to date pipe stem fragments.NPS Archeology Program: Archeology for Interpreters Accolades In, 1952 Harrington received the Citation for Distinguished Service from the United States Secretary of the Interior, an award usually given to high-ranking government officials or as a posthumous recognition of major contributions. In 1981, the Harringtons created the J.C. Harrington Medal, the Society for Historical Archaeology's award recognizing scholastic contributions to the discipline. Pinky Harrington received the first medal at the society's 1982 annual meeting in Philadelphia, and it has been presented yearly since. Other recipients have included John L. Cotter (1984), Edward B.

He progressed developments in twelve-tone composition ('). His own teachers included Joseph Marx, Anton von Webern, Arnold Sch√∂nberg and Josef Matthias Hauer. Life Othmar Steinbauer was born in Vienna. His father was a bank employee, originally from Styria. Steinbauer attended teacher training college on the northwest side of Vienna. On passing his exams here he volunteered for military service in 1915. By the time the war ended, in 1918, he had reached the rank of a junior reserve officer (Oberleutnant). He now studied the violin, with both Otakar ≈†evƒç√≠k and Gottfried Feist as teachers. He also studied music theory with Joseph Marx and later, after 1919, with Arnold Sch√∂nberg. In the Society for Private Musical Performances (') he quickly built a reputation for his musical interpretation. During 1921/22 he was also playing the viola in the Kolisch Quartet. In 1922 he moved north, to Berlin, where he worked as a theatre musician. Together with Josef Rufer (1893‚Äì1985) and Karl Wiener (1891‚Äì1942) and Schoenberg's pupil Max Deutsch (1892‚Äì1982), he was a founder of the Society for Contemporary Music Performances in Berlin ('). In this connection he organised a large number of concert performances. However, the peaking of the German inflation crisis forced him to return to Vienna in 1923. Between 1924 and 1928 he focused on giving music lessons, both for the violin and for music theory. He also studied intensively some issues in music theory. Around 1927 he produced a paper entitled \\"The Nature of Tonality\\" ('), which was published in 1928 by C.H. Beck in Munich. In it he attempted to provide a philosophical underpinning for tonality based on the idealistic Philosophy of Totality propounded by Othmar Spann, of whose teachings Steinbauer was an enthusiastic adherent between 1925 and 1930. In February 1928 Steinbauer set up a chamber orchestra, the \\"Wiener Kammer Konzert Vereinigung\\" which performed successfully under his direction for the next three years in Germany and Austria. The early focus was on the baroque and early classical repertoires, but Steinbauer soon found himself asked to include modern music in the orchestra's programmes. Steinbauer set about getting hold of published works, turning to the Vienna-based Universal Edition company which published music both for the \\"Schoenberg circle\\" and for Josef Matthias Hauer. However, the publishers recommended only the music by Schoenberg and his adherents, Steinbach increasingly turned to Hauer directly. A friendship developed between them which included exchanges of ideas in the field of music theory, and which led, on 7 March 1930, to the first performance of Hauer's Symphonic Pieces Op. 49 by Steinbauer.Nikolaus Fheodoroff and others: Josef Matthias Hauer: (writings, promotional materials and other documents). DVD-ROM. Lafite, Wien 2007, pp. 463‚Äì465. Hauer was able to instruct Steinbauer on the basis of his Divertimento for smnall orchestra Op.61 which he dedicated to him. Based on the insights provided by Hauer, Steinbauer went on to develop his own \\"twelve tone theory\\" which he first summarised in a (never finished) manuscript as a \\"doctrine of sound and melody\\" (') in 1934. The years from 1930 to 1935 he devoted, primarily, to composition and other work around his new doctrine, most of which was developed during this period even though it was not till the end of the 1950s that it acquired the soubriquet ' (commonly translated as \\"twelve tone technique\\"). In 1935 Steinbauer again relocated to Berlin where he took a small job as artistic research assistant (') in the National Institute for Music Research. He worked in the museum of old instruments which was part of the institute. And he composed. Early in 1938 Austria was merged into an enlarged Nazi German state and the regional Gauleiter (governor), Odilo Globocnik, gave orders for the establishment of a new music academy for Vienna, to be divided into two sections. One would focus on members of the Hitler Youth organisation and be headed up by Gottfried Preinfalk, and a second for German adult education under the auspices of the Nazi Strength Through Joy (') leisure time and recreation operation. Steinbauer, who now moved back to Vienna, was given the headship of the overall organisation. The academy was quickly built and reportedly functioned to a high standard. In 1939 he also set up the Working Association for Old Music ('). In 1945 war ended and the Nazis fell from power. Steinbauer was dismissed and devoted himself primarily to composition and teaching. He also found time to invent a new type of violin based instrument, the so-called \\"Viellen\\", patented in 1951 and said to be particularly suitable for making music in the home. From 1952 Steinbauer taught the violin at the Vienna Music Academy (today the University for the Music and Presentational Arts). Between 1959 and his retirement in 1961 he also provided special courses on twelve- tone composition. Composers who received certificates after completing one of these course included , Kim Dal-Sung, Heinz Kratochwil, Hans Herbert M√ºller, Norbert Nowotny, , Otto Sulzer und G√ºnther Theil. In 1961, after his retirement, he founded the Institute for Twelve-tone Composition in Vienna\\" (') which he headed till his death the next year. Others involved with the institute included who still teaches and composes, according to Steinbauer's precepts. During the final year of his life Steinbauer also gave violin lessons to members of the Vienna Boys' Choir. Steinbauer died on 5 September 1962 while taking a summer break at Altenburg (Wilhelmsburg) in the Lower Austrian countryside to the west of Vienna. The teaching book he had been writing on twelve-tone composition was unfinished at the time of his death. Later it was completed by former student Helmut Neumann, and published in 2001.

Bodnar (1916 ‚Äì 2014) was a sports medicine practitioner and former physician for the Notre Dame football team. Early life Bodnar was born in the far south side of Chicago. He was the son of Hungarian immigrants. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Illinois in 1939 and his medical degree from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in 1941 and went on to pursue his medical internship and surgical orthopedic residency at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. He served as an orthopedic surgeon in the United States Army during World War II (from 1943 ‚Äì 1946) before returning to finish his orthopedic residency in New Orleans. Career Bodnar worked as an orthopedic surgeon, setting up a practice in 1947 in South Bend. This later became the South Bend Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine Clinic. From 1949 to 1985, he worked at the University of Notre Dame as an orthopedic surgeon and served as its Director of Sports Medicine from 1976 to 1985 and as a senior consultant after that. He also taught at Notre Dame's extension of the Indiana University School of Medicine. Bodnar was a pioneer of sports medicine in the United States. In the 1960s, the phrase ‚Äúsports medicine‚Äù was not mentioned in medical schools or residency programs. Faculty discussed the treatment of knee and shoulder injuries in athletes but, as an academic specialty, sports medicine did not exist. In 1972, Bodnar, along with other orthopedic surgeons, founded the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM). Bodnar served as one of the first presidents of AOSSM from 1976-1977. During his tenure as president, he helped facilitate formalization of relationships with organizations like NATA and the U.S. Olympic Committee. Bodnar also was responsible for stimulating the development of a Commission on Sports Medicine, under the Indiana State Medical Association. He was honored with the Mr. Sports Medicine Award in 1978 and is now also a member of the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine Hall of Fame. Bodnar helped warm up Joe Montana during Notre Dame‚Äôs come from behind victory in the 1979 Cotton Bowl Classic. During the game, Montana's body temperature had dipped to 96 degrees and he was battling hypothermia. He was forced to retire to the locker room where Bodnar fed him chicken soup to warm him up. He recovered and was able to get back to the game. This story was published as Chicken Soup to the Rescue, in Chicken Soup for the Sports Fan's Soul, as part of the Chicken Soup for the Soul book series. Bodnar served on the board of Cerebral Palsy Society, American Red Cross, and the Indiana Governor‚Äôs Council on Fitness and Health. He also served on the board of the Sister Maura Brannick Health Center where he volunteered for many years. In 1988 Bodnar was awarded the honor of Sagamore of the Wabash by Governor Robert Orr in 1988, recognizing his contributions to sports medicine and the NATA. He also received the EM Morris Award from Indiana University South Bend and was inducted into the Order of Malta. Personal life Bodnar retired in 1999. He authored two books late in life. His first book, Carnie (2010), is a memoir of the days he spent as a young teenager in the 1920s working as a part of his father's carnival. His second book, Sports Medicine, Notre Dame (2014) covers memories from this 35 years working in Sports Medicine at Notre Dame. In 1943, Bodnar married fellow Chicagoan, Bernardine Brennan, with whom he enjoyed 56 years of marriage until her death. Bodnar died in 2014 at the age of 98. He was survived by his nine children, 24 grandchildren and 15 great grandchildren.

As they had done before Holy Cross won the premier conference tournament for the successor Atlantic Hockey conference but this time were invited to the 2004 tournament. While Pearl's team was blanked by North Dakota their second berth two years later provided what is widely considered the biggest upset in college hockey history when the 15th seed Crusaders downed the second ranked Minnesota Golden Gophers 4-3 in overtime. In addition to hockey, Pearl was also the head coach of the Holy Cross Crusaders baseball team from 1999 to 2001.

It is one of two types of fluid-jet looms, the other being a water-jet loom, which was developed previously. Fluid-jet looms can operate at a faster speed than predecessor looms such as rapier looms, but they are not as common. The machinery used in fluid-jet weaving consists of a main nozzle, auxiliary nozzles or relay nozzles, and a profile reed. Air-jet looms are capable of producing standard household and apparel fabrics for items such as shirts, denim, sheets, towels, and sports apparel, as well as industrial products such as printed circuit board cloths. Heavier yarns are more suitable for air-jet looms than lighter yarns. Air-jet looms are capable of weaving plaids, as well as dobby and jacquard fabrics. Method In an air-jet loom, yarn is pulled from the supply package, and the measuring disc removes a length of yarn of the width of fabric being woven. A clamp holds the yarn and an auxiliary air nozzle forms it into the shape of a hairpin. The main nozzle blows the yarn, the clamp opens, and the yarn is carried through the shed. At the end of the insertion cycle, the clamp closes, the yarn is beaten in and cut, and the shed is closed. The jets are electronically controlled, with an integrated database. Research has been done to analyze factors that contribute to compressed air use, a major source of energy consumption, in air-jet looms. History and production The air-jet loom was invented in Czechoslovakia in the 20th century and was later refined by Swiss, Dutch, and Japanese companies. Companies that produce air-jet looms include Toyota Industries and Tsudakoma, both based in Japan; Picanol, based in Belgium; Dornier, based in Germany; RIFA, based in China; and Itema, based in Italy.

Bread is also significant in Christianity as one of the elements (alongside wine) of the Eucharist; see sacramental bread. The word companion comes from Latin com- \\"with\\" + panis \\"bread\\". The political significance of bread is considerable. In 19th century Britain, the inflated price of bread due to the Corn Laws caused major political and social divisions, and was central to debates over free trade versus protectionism. The Assize of Bread and Ale in the 13th century demonstrated the importance of bread in medieval times by setting heavy punishments for short-changing bakers, and bread appeared in Magna Carta a half-century earlier. Like other foods, choosing the \\"right\\" kind of bread is used as a social signal, to let others know, for example, that the person buying expensive bread is financially secure, or the person buying whatever type of bread that the current fashions deem most healthful is a health-conscious consumer.Copeland, Libby (6 April 2012) \\"White Bread Kills: A history of a national paranoia.\\" Slate As a simple, cheap, and adaptable type of food, bread is often used as a synecdoche for food in general in some languages and dialects, such as Greek and Punjabi. There are many variations on the basic recipe of bread worldwide, such as bagels, baguettes, biscuits, bocadillo, brioche, chapatis, Challah, lavash, naan, pitas, pizza, pretzels, puris, tortillas, and many others. There are various types of traditional \\"cheese breads\\" in many countries, including Brazil, Colombia, Italy, and Russia. Across the world =Asia= Classic white Chinese Mantou The traditional bread in China is mantou. It is made by steaming or deep-frying dough made from wheat flour. In Northern China and northern central China, mantou is often eaten as an alternative staple to rice. Steamed mantou is similar to Western white bread, but since it is not baked it does not have a brown outer crust. Mantou that have a filling such as meat or vegetables (cha siu bao, for example) are called baozi. The kompyang of Fuzhou is an example of a Chinese bread baked in a clay oven. Aloo paratha served with butter, from India. In the Indian subcontinent, chapati or roti, types of unleavened flatbreads usually made from whole-wheat flour or sometimes refined wheat flour and baked on a hot iron griddle called a tava, form the mainstay of the people's diet. The chapati, as it became known, is an unleavened bread with a long tradition. The bread can be spelled Chapathi, Chapatti, or Chappati.Flour related traditions and quotes. fabflour.co.uk Rotis and naans are usually served with curry throughout the region. A variant called makki di roti uses maize flour rather than white flour. Another variant is puri, a thin flat bread that is fried rather than baked and puffs up while cooked. Paratha is another variation on roti. Naan (leavened wholewheat bread) is baked in a tandoor or clay oven and is rarely prepared at home. White and brown breads are also very common, but not as common as roti. In the Philippines, pandesal (or pan de sal, meaning bread of salt or salt bread) is a rounded bread usually eaten by Filipinos during breakfast. The Philippines also produces a cheap generic white bread called Pinoy Tasty. =Europe= French bread Arabian pita bread An enormous variety of bread is available across Europe. Germany alone lays claim to over 1,300 basic varieties of breads, rolls, and pastries, as well as having the largest consumption of bread per capita worldwide. Bread and salt is a welcome greeting ceremony in many central and eastern European cultures. During important occasions when guests arrive, they are offered a loaf of bread with a salt holder to represent hospitality. In France, there has been a huge decline in the baguette culture. In the 1970s, French people were consuming an average of one loaf of bread per day. Only a century ago, the French ate approximately 3 loaves of bread per day. Today, French people eat only a half a loaf of bread per day. In response to this decline, bakers have created a national campaign to get people to call at the bakery before and after work just as they used to. The campaign models the American \\"Got Milk?\\" campaign, plastering \\"Hey there, have you picked up the bread?\\" all over billboards and bread bags.Kim, Eun Kyung (6 August 2013) Mon dieu! New campaign urges French to eat more bread. TODAY.com During the 18th century, the moral economy of France was based on wheaten bread. By supplying a sufficient amount of bread to the people, the government was able to demonstrate its strong political fitness. Wheaten bread was also thought to be indispensable to one's well-being after French medical chemists had associated gluten with several nourishing elements in plants. As bread had a high gluten content compared to other cereals, it was given a reputation of being the alimentary ideal. Consequently, consumers became extremely concerned with the quality of their wheaten bread, resulting in a meticulous surveillance of wheaten bread production; they did not want their bread to contain filler additives such as bran, rye, barley, and legume flour. At the time, bread was the most sought out food as it was considered to be essential, universal, and highly nutritive. It was typical for the average French citizen to believe that it was impossible to overindulge in bread. For many, bread became the centerpiece of every meal. All other foods such as fruits, vegetables, and meats were thought as subsidiary, or ancillary to nourishment. There is a wide variety of traditional breads in Great Britain, often baked in a rectangular tin form. Round loaves are also produced, such as the North East England specialty called a stottie cake. A cob is a small round loaf. A cottage loaf is made of two balls of dough, one on top of the other, to form a figure-of-eight shape. There are many variations on bread rolls, such as baps, barms, breadcakes and so on. The Chorleywood process for mass- producing bread was developed in England in the 1960s before spreading worldwide. Mass-produced sliced white bread brands such as Wonderloaf and Mother's Pride have been criticized on grounds of poor nutritional value and taste of the loaves produced.Chorleywood, the Bread that Changed Britain. BBC.co.uk (7 June 2011). Retrieved 21 March 2013. In Spain, bread is called pan. The traditional Spanish pan is a long loaf of bread, similar to the French baguette but wider. One can buy it freshly made every morning in the traditional bakeries, where there is a large assortment of bread. A smaller version is known as bocadillo, an iconic piece of the Hispanic cuisine. In Spain, especially in the Mediterranean area, there have been guilds of bakers for over 750 years. The bakers guild in Barcelona was founded in 1200 AD.La histopa del pan. Juntadeandalucia.es. Retrieved 21 March 2013. There is a region called Tierra del Pan (\\"Land of the Bread\\"), located in the province of Zamora, where economy was in the past joined to this activity. According to Guinness World Records, Turkey has the largest per capita consumption of bread in the world as of 2000, with 199.6 kg (440 lb) per person; Turkey is followed in bread consumption by Serbia and Montenegro with 135 kg (297 lb 9.9 oz), and Bulgaria with 133.1 kg (293 lb 6.9 oz). =Latin America= Flat breads of many flours are a widespread along Latin America, the most common probably being sopaipillas. Chile is the second bread consumer worldwide. Corn tortillas are the staple bread in most of Mexico, bread rolls in many varieties are an important daily food for city dwellers. Popular breads in Mexico include the bolillo roll and pan dulce. Pan dulce, which is Spanish for \\"sweet bread\\", is eaten in the evenings with hot drinks like traditional hot chocolate.Central Chilean sopaipillas pasadas (soaked), and without chancaca sauce Chapati breads are common in the Caribbean Islands and Guiana. In Peru, bread has many variations due to the diversity of Peruvian cuisine. People usually eat pan de piso and pan serrano. There are also some kinds of bread made of potatoes; these are currently popular in the Andes. Bizcochos are sweet bread usually eaten with some butter and hot chocolate. A dough made with cooked pumpkin or squash, often shaped and fried into doughnuts and served with a sweet fruity dipping sauce, is a traditional favorite. Bread is an ingredient of sopas de ajo, gazpacho, and salmorejo. In Venezuela and Colombia arepa is a common type of bread made with corn flour, arepas are usually filled for making diverse sandwiches. Arepa de huevo is type of arepa from the Pacific coast of Colombia. Many breads in Paraguay, Brazil and Northeast of Argentina are made with flour and cheese, like chipa, sopa paraguaya and p√£o de queijo. In the Rio de la Plata region sopaipillas are called torta frita and are fried in cow fat, other type of bread that is commonly found is galleta de campa√±a, a grease dough made of layers,SaltShaker Spanish-English-Spanish Food & Wine Dictionary: Second Edition roscas are a type of bread in Uruguay that is commonly eaten on semana santa (Easter), they are usually filled either with chicharrones or quince cheese.M.F.K.

Pan de miga is a bread that is specially made for making sandwiches de miga and mostly is not consumed on another way, same as pebetes that are commonly filled with ham and cheese. A type of croissant commonly found in Rio de la plata is Medialuna. =North Africa and Horn of Africa= Meal consisting of injera and several kinds of wat or tsebhi (stew) or (maraq), typical of Ethiopian cuisine, Eritrean cuisine and Somali cuisine. In the Horn of Africa, notably Ethiopia and Eritrea, a bread called injera is made from a grain called teff.Ethiopian Injera Recipe  Exploratorium. Exploratorium.edu. Retrieved 21 March 2013. This is a wide, flat, circular bread that is in a similar shape of a tortilla and is also used as a utensil to pick up food. Also consumed is a thick and chewy fried bread that is smothered in oil beforehand. The rghifa bread is a staple in the food of Morocco and consists of several layers of lightly cooked bread. In Egypt, bread is called aysh (aish merahrah or aish baladi) and the ancient proverb has it that \\"life without aysh is not life\\". The typical Egyptian bread is circular, about 6 inches across, often baked in small neighbourhood bakeries and bought still warm. =North America= Cornbread is a popular Native American cuisine Traditional breads in the United States include cornbreads and various quick breads, such as biscuits. Rolls, made from wheat flour and yeast, are another popular and traditional bread, eaten with the dinner meal. Cornbread is made from cornmeal and can differ significantly in taste and texture from region to region. In general, the South prefers white cornmeal with little to no wheat flour or sweeteners added; it is traditionally baked in a cast-iron skillet and ideally has a crunchy outside and moist inside. The North usually prefers yellow cornmeal with sometimes as much as half wheat flour in its composition, as well as sugar, honey, or maple syrup. This results in a bread that is softer and sweeter than its southern counterpart. Wheat flour was not available to the average North American family until the early 1900s when a new breed of wheat termed Marquis was produced. This was a hybrid of Red Fife and Hard red winter wheat. Marquis grew well and soon average Americans were able to have homemade wheat bread on the table. Homemade wheat breads are made in a rectangular tin similar to those in the United Kingdom. Spoon bread, also called batter bread or egg bread, is made of cornmeal with or without added rice and hominy, and is mixed with milk, eggs, shortening and leavening to such a consistency that it must be served from the baking dish with a spoon. This is popular chiefly in the South. Sourdough biscuits are traditional \\"cowboy food\\" in the West. The San Francisco Bay Area is known for its crusty sourdough. Up until the 20th century (and even later in certain regions), any flour other than cornmeal was considered a luxury; this would explain the greater variety in cornbread types compared to that of wheat breads. In terms of commercial manufacture, the most popular bread has been a soft-textured type with a thin crust that is usually made with milk and is slightly sweet; this is the type that is generally sold ready-sliced in packages. It is usually eaten with the crust, but some eaters or preparers may remove the crust due to a personal preference or style of serving, as with finger sandwiches served with afternoon tea. Some of the softest bread, including Wonder Bread, is referred to as \\"balloon bread\\". Though white \\"sandwich bread\\" is the most popular, Americans are trending toward more artisanal breads. Different regions of the country feature certain ethnic bread varieties including the Ashkenazi Jewish bagel, the French baguette, the Italian-style scali bread made in New England, Jewish rye, commonly associated with delicatessen cuisine, and Native American frybread (a product of hardship, developed during the Indian resettlements of the 19th century).  Religious significance  The Eucharist (also called Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper) is considered a sacrament, ordinance, or equivalent in most Christian denominations. =Abrahamic religions= Bread has symbolic roles in the Abrahamic religions of Judaism and Christianity. During the Jewish festival of Passover, only unleavened bread is eaten, in commemoration of the flight from slavery in Egypt. The Israelites did not have enough time to allow their bread to rise, and so ate only unleavened bread matzo.Thought For Food: An Overview of the Seder. Farbrengen Magazine In the Christian ritual of the Eucharist, bread is eaten as a sacrament either as a symbolic representation of the body of Christ or, as in the Catholic liturgy, as a real manifestation of the body of Christ.Eucharist (Christianity) ‚Äì Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Specific aspects of the ritual itself, including the composition of the bread, vary from denomination to denomination. The differences in the practice of the Eucharist stem from different descriptions and depictions of the Last Supper which provides the scriptural basis for the Eucharist. The Synoptic Gospels present the Last Supper as a Passover meal and suggest that the bread at the Last Supper would be unleavened. However, in the chronology in Gospel of John, the Last Supper occurred the day before Passover suggesting that the bread would be leavened. Despite this point of disagreement, the Council of Florence of the Catholic church agreed that \\"the body of Christ is truly confected in both unleavened and leavened wheat bread, and priests should confect the body of Christ in either\\". =Paganism= Some traditions of Wicca and Neo-Paganism consume bread as part of their religious rituals, attaching varied symbolism to the act. Anti-bread movements Some have rejected bread entirely or rejected types of bread that they consider unhealthy. Reasons for doing so have varied through history: whole grain bread has been criticized as being unrefined, and white bread as being unhealthfully processed; homemade bread has been deemed unsanitary, and factory-made bread regarded with suspicion for being adulterated. Amylophobia, literally \\"fear of starch\\", was a movement in the US during the 1920s and 1930s. In the United States, bread sales fell by 11.3% between 2008 and 2013. This statistic might reflect a change in the types of food from which Americans are getting their carbohydrates, but the trends are unclear because of the concurrent effects of the Great Recession. Bread market remains challenging. Food Business News, 17 September 2013 It is also possible that changing diet fashions affected the decrease in bread sales during that period.Why Bread Is No Longer Rising. The Huffington Post. 31 October 2012 In medicine The ancient Egyptians used moldy bread to treat infections that arose from dirt in burn wounds.

He was one of the earliest critics of French colonial power in his country, later renamed Benin. Biography =Early life= He was born in Porto-Novo on 25 December 1887. His father was jeweler to the kings of Porto Novo and his mother was descended from royalty.Houngnikpo & Decalo 2013, p. 209 Hunkanrin was a member of the first graduating class of the Ecole William Ponty in Dakar in 1904.Manning 1998, p. 79 He returned to Ouidah in 1906 after receiving a teaching position. However, he was fired in 1910 after having a dispute with a colonial administrator over how his superior dealt with pupils. He received support from teachers an students, but thanks to a governor's notation in his record, this would be his last teaching job. =Journalism and political activities= Hunkanrin found work at the Compagnie Francaise de l'Afrique Occidentale, but was arrested in 1912 due to insulting and threatening his boss. Sent to prison in Dakar, he developed a friendship with Blaise Diagne and became more critical of French colonial rule. In 1914, he returned to Dahomey.Appiah & Gates 2010, p. 587 He edited the newspaper Le Messager du Dahomey with Paul Hazoum√© during World War I. He also prepared articles from abroad criticizing French treatment of Dahomeyan recruits and founded a Dahomeyan branch of the League of Human Rights.Houngnikpo & Decalo 2013, p. 210 In newspaper articles, he criticized the abuses of French colonialism and urged Africans to become educated, as it was the only way they could become equal with the French administrators. Despite not calling for decolonization, he became a great annoyance to the French. Hunkanrin lived in hiding, travelling between Senegal, Dahomey, and Nigeria, and only came out of hiding in 1918 when Blaise Diagne arranged for him to volunteer for the military. It is debatable whether this was a move of political expediency or an expression of devotion to France.McDougall 1989, p. 295. Nonetheless, his military service resulted in several disputes, and he was court-marshalled in 1921 and served several months in a French prison. Hunkanrin broke off with Diagne, claiming he accepted bribes to find recruits for the army. When he returned to Dahomey in December 1921, he turned again to critical journalism. It wasn't long before he drew the ire of the French and was again imprisoned, officially for forgery. In reality, it was his militant nationalist views that led him to the jailhouse. He remained loyal to France, but as an abstraction, the France that declared the universal rights of man regardless of national origin. Hunkanrin repeatedly criticized the idea the some French people had more rights than others. =Exiles and disturbances= From jail, he indirectly played a role in the Porto-Novo disturbances of 1923. He incited the populations of Porto-Novo and Cotonou not to pay taxes and supported a Nigerian resident for the Porto-Novo throne, which earning him accusations of being too pro-British. Demonstrations ensued for the throne claimant, and a dockyard strike broke out in Porto-Novo and Cotonou. Smaller strikes also took place in more agricultural areas, all of which the French brutally suppressed. At his trial for his involvement, Hunkanrin cited an 1882 treaty between Porto-Novo and France, as well as the fact he was behind bars at the time. The French administration was not impressed, and Hunkanrin and 10 others were sentenced to ten years exile in Mauritania. In 1931, he published a scathing expose of slavery in Mauritania, Un forfait colonial: I'esclavage en Mauritanie. As he stated in the preface, its purpose was to \\"illuminate the true face of France in this territory where the French flag flies - emblem of peace, liberty, and justice: the France of the Rights of Man, maternal France, good, generous and just, ... It is well understood that I am only to serve the interests of France and humanity.\\"McDougall 1989, p. 285. The book received a mixed reception but generated an internal inquiry by French administrators.McDougall 1989, p. 286. Lieutenant Governor Jean-Baptiste Victor Chazelas dismissed the tract as propaganda inspired by Hunkanrin's Communist friends in Paris, and criticized the way he received information from female slaves and prostitutes.McDougall 1989, p. 288. While the tract is now seen as an important historical document of modern slavery, it is generally acknowledged that Hunkanrin committed some flaws, such as not distinguishing between harantin and slaves.McDougall 1989, p. 291. When he returned to Dahomey in 1933, he began studying traditional customs and seemed to have genuinely been changed by the exile. Nonetheless, in 1934 he co- authored two articles in La Voix du Dahomey along with Louis Ignacio-Pinto that were critical of French administrators. He served a brief jail sentence and moved out of the spotlight for a few years. When World War II broke out, he sided with Charles DeGaulle and his Free French forces. Hunkanrin found employment as a British spy and recruited soldiers to the war effort in Nigeria. He was arrested in 1941 for undermining the Vichy regime, and at his trial in Dakar he was sentenced to death. This was later commuted to eight years exile in Mali. When French West Africa rallied to the Free French in 1942, the same officials remained in Dahomey and Hunkanrin was nor released. In fact, it took a public campaign to secure his release nearly two years after the war ended.Manning 1998, p. 137. =Freedom and later life= When Hunkanrin was freed in 1947, he again became involved in politics and joined the Porto-Novo electoral committee in the years before a political party was formed in Dahomey. He was appointed the chairman of the important pressure group Union des Anciens du Dahomey in 1950. That year, he edited the L'Eveil newspaper in Porto-Novo. When Dahomey received its independence in 1960, Hunkanrin was deemed too old to serve in any full-time government position. Instead, he was a special consultant to both Hubert Maga and Sourou-Migan Apithy. Hunkanri died in Porto Novo on 28 May 1964, and was eulogized by French speakers for combating colonial abuses and for being the first nationalist in Dahomey. He was posthumously awarded the title of \\"Grande Officier de l'Ordre National du Dahomey\\".

The earliest reference to cricket here is from a 1666 letter by Sir Robert Paston, a resident of Richmond. The earliest known fixture on the Green was Surrey v Middlesex in June 1730. Surrey won the match, although the runs were not recorded.Waghorn, p. 1. Perhaps the most infamous game to be played on the Green took place the following year on 23 August when a Mr Chambers organised a match against the Duke of Richmond's team from Sussex. It is the earliest match where team scores are known: Duke of Richmond 79, Mr Chambers 119; Duke of Richmond 72, Mr Chambers 23‚Äì5 (approx.). The game ended promptly at a pre- agreed time although Mr Chambers with \\"four or five more to have come in\\" and needing \\"about 8 to 10 notches\\" clearly had the upper hand. The end result caused a fracas among the crowd at Richmond Green who were incensed by the prompt finish because the Duke of Richmond had arrived late and delayed the start of the game. The riot resulted in some of the Sussex players \\"having the shirts torn off their backs; and it was said a law suit would commence about the play\\".Buckley, p. 6. Another notable game was the earliest known tied match on 22 July 1741 when Surrey played London. The scores were not reported but the tie occasioned the bets to be drawn on both sides. The teams decided to play again at the Artillery Ground the following Monday but the result is not recorded.Waghorn, p. 27. The first reference to a Richmond team playing at Richmond Green is also the last reference to its use as a major venue. This was on 4 July 1743 when Richmond & Kingston were beaten by London. The noted batsman Robert Colchin, of Bromley, played for London as a given man.Ashley- Cooper, p. 21. The Green is presently home to two village cricket teams each affiliated to two of Richmond's pubs, The Prince's Head and The Cricketers. Midweek matches are contested in the modern limited overs format of Twenty20 usually on a Tuesday or Thursdays, where surrounding village teams compete for the Len Smith Charity Shield.

Plautius was a member of the gens Plautia, and the son of Quintus Plautius, consul in AD 36.Lily Ross Taylor, Trebula Suffenas and the Plautii Silvani, 1956, p 24. He was nephew to Aulus Plautius, the man who led the Invasion of Britain in 43 AD, and it was through his good offices that Plautius Lateranus escaped the death penalty in AD 48, after his affair with the emperor Claudius' wife Messalina was discovered. Fortunately, Claudius held Aulus Plautius in high esteem.Tacitus, Annales xi. 36, xv. 60. Though he escaped death, he was removed from his senatorial position, but was later granted re- admittance under Nero Tacitus, Annales, xiii. 9. In AD 65, Plautius Lateranus, who was then consul designatus, was accused of conspiracy against the emperor in the Pisonian conspiracy. Tacitus says that Lateranus joined from no personal grudge against Nero, but out of patriotism alone.Tacitus, Annales, xv. 49. His part in the plot was as follows: He was to prostrate himself before Nero, in a pretense of petitioning for financial assistance; then, being both 'resolute and muscular', he was to bring him down and hold him, allowing others of a military nature involved in the plot to kill him.Tacitus, Annales, xv. 53. When the plot was exposed, Nero had Plautius executed. Tacitus states that his 'removal' was so hasty that he was not permitted to say goodbye to his children, nor to choose the manner of his death. He was taken to a 'place reserved for slave executions', and died in resolute silence. The man who executed him, Statius Proxumus, was also involved in the plot, but Lateranus did not expose him.Tacitus, Annales, xv. 25. Though Tacitus doesn't state the means of execution, Epictetus in his Stoic Discourses makes it clear that he was beheaded. Epictetus asks his students why they shouldn't accept death; why they should fear dying alone. Why don't they hold out their necks in \\"the way Lateranus did at Rome, when condemned by Nero to be beheaded? He held out his neck willingly to take the blow‚Äìbut the blow was deficient, so he recoiled a bit, but then had enough self-command to offer his neck a second time.\\" Epictetus, Discourses and Selected Writings, Discourses, i, 18, 19.

He is a former director of National Botanical Research Institute and an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy, National Academy of Sciences, India, National Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Maharashtra Academy of Sciences. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1981, for his contributions to biological sciences.  Biography  Prafullachandra Vishnu Sane, born on the Christmas Eve of 1937 at Chiplun, in Ratnagiri district in the Indian state of Maharashtra to Vishnu Jagannath Sane and Indira, did his schooling at New English High School, Nagpur and college studies at Agriculture College of Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth from where he graduated in 1958. After obtaining his master's degree in agriculture from Nagpur University in 1960, he started his career at Bureau of Indian Standards in 1961 and continued there till 1964 when he moved to the University of Alberta, Edmonton for his doctoral studies to secure a PhD in 1968. He stayed in the North America for three more years, working at the University of California, Berkeley as an assistant research botanist and returned to India to join the Agricultural Biochemistry Section of Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) as its head in 1972 where he worked till 1984. In between, receiving an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation fellowship, he spent one year at Ruhr University Bochum during 1979‚Äì80. In 1984, he became the director of the National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow and held the post till his superannuation in 1997. Post retirement, he joined Jain Irrigation Systems Limited, Jalgaon where he is a principal adviser at their Agri-Biotech division. Sane is married to Suchitra Khandekar and the couple has two sons. The family lives in Lucknow.  Legacy  During his stint at Ruhr University Bochum, Sane worked on the modality of electron transport and transduction of energy in chloroplast membranes and discovered that the generation of pH gradient across the membranes is due to the presence of proton-translocating proteins. Basing his studies on a mutant of Gateway Barley, he did an elaborate biochemical analysis of carbon assimilation and reactions of Ch1 biosynthesis. Associating with Roderic Park, he developed a new method for the isolation of PS-I and PS-II, without the use of detergents and propounded a model for distributing the two photosystems in the chloroplast lamellae. Their findings were published in an article, Distribution of Function and Structure in Chloroplast Lamellae, which eventually became a citation classic. During his days at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Sane led a team who discovered the involvement of charge pairs in producing the emitted light and these researches are reported to have helped in widening our knowledge about energy storage during electron transport. Later, he also made pioneering studies on tobacco transgenic plants and sorghum. He has published his research findings as chapters in several books and in over 160 articles, ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific papers, has listed 87 of them. It was during his tenure as the director of National Botanical Research Institute, the Centre for Plant Molecular Biology was established at the institute. He is a former president and an adviser to the International Society of Environmental Botanists (ISEB), a Lucknow-based non-profit, non-governmental organisation promoting coordinated research on plants and environmental pollution and served as a member of the council of the Indian National Science Academy from 1996 to 1998. He has also mentored 20 scholars in their doctoral studies.  Awards and honors  The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded Sane the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1981. The National Academy of Sciences, India elected him as their fellow in 1987, the same year as he became an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences. The year 1991 brought him the Bharat Jyoti Best Scientist of the Year Award as well as fellowships of the Indian National Science Academy and the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Sane, who is also a fellow of the Maharashtra Academy of Sciences and a life member of the Society for Plant Physiology and Biochemistry and the Indian Photobiology Society, received the Birbal Sahni Medal of the Indian Botanical Society in 1994.

It caps the percentage of revenue that a proprietary school can receive from federal financial aid sources at 90%; the other 10% of revenue must come from alternative sources. Not all federal sources of financial aid fall under this cap. In particular, funds supporting the education of troops and veterans, such as the GI Bill and Department of Defense Tuition Assistance program, are not subject to this cap. The rule is intended to use a market mechanism to weed out the worst performing proprietary schools. The requirement‚Äôs intent was to ensure that no school could rely solely on federal funding. Since 2010, growing scrutiny of the for-profit industry has spurred new efforts to strengthen the 90-10 rule. Some veteran and military groups have pushed for the GI Bill and Tuition Assistance Program to be included in the funds that are capped. Democratic lawmakers have sought new regulations to improve reporting and transparency in the rule.  History of the 90-10 Rule  The origin of the 90-10 rule lies in the history of veteran‚Äôs education benefits. Following World War II, a number of proprietary, fly-by-night colleges emerged to meet the heightened demand for colleges from returning troops. Concerned with the quality of these schools, the Veteran Administration instituted an 85-15 rule, capping the percentage of a school‚Äôs revenue from GI Bill funds at 85%. In 1972, for-profit colleges became eligible to receive federal student financial aid under Title IV. There were then no restrictions on the percentage of revenue that could be received from these sources. In the 1990s, lawmakers became concerned with the quality and recruiting practices of for-profit colleges. Almost half of student loan defaults came from for-profit school students despite comprising just a fifth of loans. This growing concern led to new efforts to impose more regulations on the industry. The result was included in the 1992 Higher Education Act, which included the first iteration of today‚Äôs 90-10 rule. It required that a for-profit school receive no more than 85% of its revenue from Title IV financial aid sources. This rule was modeled after the earlier Veteran Administration regulation. During the 1998 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, Congress changed the 85-15 rule to the 90-10 rule. Now for- profit colleges could receive up to 90%, rather than 85%, of revenue from Title IV funds.  Recent Efforts to Modify the 90-10 Rule  With again increasing scrutiny of the for-profit school industry, the 90-10 rule has again become controversial. Many advocates are pushing efforts to modify the 90-10 rule. = Include Military and Veteran Benefits in the 90-10 Cap = Military and veteran benefits, such as the GI Bill and Department of Defense Tuition Assistance Program, are not subject to the 90-10 cap. Many for-profit colleges sought to take advantage of this exclusion and focused their recruiting on troops and veterans. In 2012, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee investigation revealed the deceptive practices that some for-profit colleges use to recruit troops and veterans. Recruiters faced significant pressure to attract military veterans; some recruiters were found to falsely promise that veterans and military benefits would cover the full cost of school. Others published military themed websites, such as GIBill.com, to push troops and veterans to toward for-profit colleges. This report helped jumpstart an effort among some Congressional lawmakers and military and veterans groups to have military and veteran benefits included in the 90-10 cap. Many Members of Congress, including Democratic Senators Dick Durbin, Tom Carper, and Richard Blumenthal and Representative Jackie Speier, introduced legislation to close this \\"loophole.\\" None of these efforts succeeded. The push to include military and veteran benefits in the 90-10 cap has garnered fierce opposition from the for-profit school industry group, the Career Education Colleges and Universities, previously known as the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities. Many proprietary colleges receive more than 90% of their revenue from federal sources if military and veteran benefits are included in the calculation. A 2014 report from the Center for Investigative Reporting showed that more than 133 schools would fail the 90-10 rule if military and veteran benefits were included. Efforts to make this change continue. In November 2015, Senator Dick Durbin [D-IL] introduced legislation to include military and veteran benefits in the 90-10 cap. The bill remains stuck in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee. President Barack Obama expressed support for the bill shortly after its introduction. In 2015, Secretary Hillary Clinton expressed support for the inclusion of military and veteran education benefits in the 90% cap. = Reduce the 90-10 Cap to 85-15 = Some lawmakers are also trying to lower the percentage of revenue a for-profit school can receive from federal funds from 90% to 85%. If military and veteran benefits were included in this lower cap, the Center for Investigative Reporting found that an additional 292 schools would fail this lower standard. The change was included in the stalled Protecting Our Students and Taxpayers Act of 2015, introduced by Senators Dick Durbin, Jack Reed, Elizabeth Warren, and Richard Blumenthal. In his 2017 Budget proposal, President Obama requested that the cap be lowered from 90% to 85%.

Its route retraces that of the ancient Via Salaria Roman road. It is a single carriageway highway for most of its route.  Route  = Rome to Rieti = SS 4 as seen near Poggio San Lorenzo Strada statale 4 Via Salaria starts Northeast of Rome, just outside the Aurelian Walls, where until 1921 Porta Salaria was located to control access to the city. The initial stretch of SS 4 is more similar to an urban road than to a highway, as the area has now become densely populated and buildings have been raised by the roadside. After four kilometres SS4 meets Tangenziale Est di Roma and, from that point on, becomes a busy dual carriageway urban road, filled by people leaving or entering the city. In the Castel Giubileo neighborhood, SS4 exits the city of Rome and meets Grande Raccordo Anulare (GRA), where most of the traffic flows. Immediately after, the road returns a single carriageway highway; in fact the subsequent 20 kilometer stretch, from the GRA to Passo Corese, has seen his importance reduced since the 6-lane Autostrada A1 runs parallel to it and absorbs most of the long-distance traffic. Nevertheless, SS4 remains important to many mid- sized towns in Rome's hinterland, such as Settebagni, Monterotondo and Mentana. Passo Corese marks both the point where SS4 enters the Province of Rieti and the point where it diverges from Autostrada A1, receiving from it all traffic to the Adriatic. The road here leaves the Tiber valley and ventures into the more hilly Sabina region, commencing its long, gradual ascent to the Apennines. For this reason, SS4 had once a rather rough course from here on, with tight bends and continuous rises and descents; current SS4 is a completely new road (constructed in the 1960s to replace the old one from Passo Corese to Rieti), much more straight and wide, albeit still with a single carriageway. The , dual carriageway road tunnel \\"Colle Giardino\\", near Rieti As the road passes the Sabine mountains, it reaches an altitude of 400 metres above sea level at Osteria Nuova and it descents into a narrow valley, then rises again until reaching 570 metres in the village of Ornaro, and finally descents. south of province capital Rieti the road becomes a dual carriageway road; the long \\"Colle Giardino\\" road tunnel allows the road to leave Sabine mountains behind and to enter the Rieti plain (400 metres on sea level) where the city is settled. = Rieti to the Adriatic = Dual carriageway trait in Rieti In Rieti SS4 turns sharply into East, quickly leaves the Rieti plain and prosecutes in the Velino valley. Shortly before Cittaducale, the road returns a single carriageway and pretty narrow road, which still needs to be uprated and follows a similar path to the ancient Roman road. While slightly ascending, SS4 reaches the spa town of Cotilia and then Antrodoco, where it joins State Highway 17 to L'Aquila. The Velino viaduct, in the Gole del Velino canyon In Antrodoco (470 metres on sea level) the road follows the river's valley, bending to the north and entering the narrow \\"Gole del Velino\\" canyon. Here SS4 becomes similar to a mountain road, since bends become more tight and the ascent more steep; but halfway through the canyon, a recently uprated stretch of the road begins, where tunnels and viaducts make the road smoother albeit still with a single carriageway. In Posta, at 700 metres above sea level, SS4 leaves the canyon and keeps going up in a broader plateau. Shortly after Cittareale the highway reaches its upper point, the Torrita Pass, at around 1010 metres on the sea level. From here on the roads descents following the course of the narrow Tronto valley. Soon after Amatrice and Accumoli, the road leaves Lazio and enters the region of Marche. Passing through Arquata del Tronto (780 metres on sea level) and Acquasanta Terme (390 metres), SS4 keeps descending until it reaches province capital Ascoli Piceno (150 metres on sea level). After Ascoli the road continues towards the Adriatic sea with a rather winding path, where it ends in a junction with SS 16 Adriatica and the Autostrada A14 in Porto d'Ascoli (near San Benedetto del Tronto). Still, such trait has been recently declassed to provincial road, since it has been replaced by Raccordo autostradale 11, a more modern dual carriageway road.  Future interventions  Today SS4 is a busy road between Rieti and Passo Corese, as it is the main road link between Rieti and Rome; motorists use it to reach the Autostrada A1 in Passo Corese and continue towards Rome in the more modern road. In this trait SS4 has a single, albeit reasonably wide carriageway, which was constructed in the 1960s in place of an earlier, less smooth road. For this reason, Italian Government plans to make SS4 a dual carriageway road between Rieti and Passo Corese, but around 1.5 billion euros are neededCamera dei deputati - Sistema Informativo Legge Opere Strategiche and it is not known when funds will be granted. Uprating of the trait from Cittaducale to Posta, where the carriageway is rather narrow and the road climbs up the Apennine mountains, is also planned to make the carriageway wider and less winding - even if the road will remain with a single carriageway. The first part of these road works started in 2005 on the Posta-Micigliano stretch and are currently underway.

History In 1984 Dianne Feinstein, then mayor of San Francisco, declared the first AIDS Awareness Week. The first AIDS Awareness Week took place in San Francisco with a goal of educating staff and students from San Francisco Community College about AIDS. This goal involves informing people about causes, effects, symptoms of AIDS, as well as prevention methods. In the same year, in Toronto, ACT held an AIDS Awareness Week, following on form New York's Aid AIDS Week Spreading awareness about AIDS also began to take place in other locations. Across Canada AIDS Awareness Week is the last week in November.http://www.hivedmonton.com/events/world- aids-day-aids-awareness-week In 2002, the Canadian Public Health Association (CPHA) led a bilingual campaign for their awareness week from 24 November ‚Äì 1 December 2002. This campaign was centered on ending the stigma and discrimination against people who have HIV/AIDS. They also worked to inform people about preventive care against HIV. In addition, they provided the community with free resources and items to further help spread awareness to others. In 1991 the US President declared, in Proclamation 6305, that 10‚Äì16 June was to be Pediatric AIDS Awareness Week.The Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America At this time over 157,525 people had AIDS in the United States. About 2,734 of these people were children 13 years old and younger. Aboriginal AIDS Awareness Week (AAAW) has been extant in Canada since 1998. https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/20th-anniversary-of-national- aboriginal-aids-awareness-week-699815911.html It began in Vancouver, but now it takes place all throughout Canada. AAAW begins on World AIDS Day, 1 December, and runs until 5 or 6 December. [World] AIDS Awareness Week is held in Perth, Australia.http://www.waaids.com/latest-news/world-aids-awareness- week-2015-wrap-up.html Latterly some organizations have used the name \\"HIV/AIDS Awareness Week\\".  Goals  The goal of Aboriginal AIDS Awareness Week is getting to zero.http://www.positivelite.com/component/zoo/item/national-aboriginal-aids- awareness-week-2014 Despite different methods used by aboriginal communities to try to decrease the prevalence of AIDS, populations like the First Nation tribes in Saskatchewan in Canada, have about 3.5 times more cases of AIDS than other areas in Canada, as well as higher than most third world countries. World AIDS Day was developed to bring awareness to the issue of AIDS in countries all around the globe and recognize the success and the steady decrease in AIDS diagnoses throughout the years. UNAIDS believes solutions need to be long-term, rather than short-term responses. Therefore, the goal is to look at prevention of HIV as well and World AIDS Day is a time to emphasize this and support people with AIDS, even though people are living with AIDS year-round. It is also a time to honor the people who lost their lives due to AIDS. Other observances Aids Awareness Month has been declared in various countries. Also World Aids Day is an international UN sponsored observance. The US government, in the form of aids.gov, presents an all-year-round diversity AIDS Awareness Calendar, for example for 2016: * National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day ‚Äì 7 February * National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day ‚Äì 10 March * National Native HIV/AIDS Awareness Day ‚Äì 20 March * National Youth HIV & AIDS Awareness Day ‚Äì 10 April * National Transgender HIV Testing Day ‚Äì 18 April * HIV Vaccine Awareness Day ‚Äì 18 May * National Asian & Pacific Islander HIV/AIDS Awareness Day ‚Äì 19 May * Hepatitis Testing Day ‚Äì 19 May * HIV Long-Term Survivors Day ‚Äì 5 June * National HIV Testing Day ‚Äì 27 June * National HIV/AIDS and Aging Awareness Day ‚Äì 18 September * National Gay Men's HIV/AIDS Awareness Day ‚Äì 27 September * National Latinx AIDS Awareness Day ‚Äì 15 October * World AIDS Day ‚Äì 1 December References Category:HIV/AIDS activism Category:November observances Category:December observances Category:Awareness weeks Category:History of HIV/AIDS Category:Recurring events established in 1984 Category:Health observances ","title":"AIDS Awareness Week"},{"id":"51793590","text":"Neotibicen resonans, commonly called Southern pine barrens cicada, is a species of annual cicada in the genus Neotibicen.

Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, written by Michael Mitnick, and executive produced by Martin Scorsese and Steven Zaillian, the film stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Edison, Michael Shannon as Westinghouse, Nicholas Hoult as Nikola Tesla, and Tom Holland as Samuel Insull, alongside Katherine Waterston, Tuppence Middleton, Matthew Macfadyen and Damien Molony. Announced in May 2012, Gomez-Rejon was confirmed in September 2015. Cumberbatch, Shannon, and Hoult joined the cast by October 2016, and filming began in England that December. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2017. Co-produced by Harvey Weinstein and originally to be distributed by The Weinstein Company, the film was shelved and sold in November 2017 following the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations. It was eventually bought by Weinstein Company successor Lantern Entertainment, which then sold domestic distribution rights to 101 Studios. After discovering a final cut privilege clause in Scorsese's contract, Gomez-Rejon convinced him to allow for reshoots and to trim ten minutes off the original version's runtime, resulting in the film that was eventually released into theaters. The film was released in the United States on October 25, 2019. Plot It is 1880 and Thomas Edison has unveiled his electric lightbulb and has decided on Direct Current (DC) which is cheaper and cleaner than gaslight but it is limited in range and expensive. George Westinghouse, a successful business man and inventor himself, wishes to learn more, and invites Edison to dinner. After being snubbed by Edison, Westinghouse sets out to prove Alternating Current (AC) is the better technology as it can work over greater distances and at significantly lower cost. Edison and Westinghouse compete to get cities across the United States to use their system. Brilliant inventor Nikola Tesla arrives in the United States and begins working with Edison, but is disappointed by Edison's unwillingness to reconsider his ideas and to fulfill what Tesla thought was a financial promise which Edison passes off as just a joke. Tesla then leaves Edison's team. Edison fiercely guards his patents and sues Westinghouse. Edison suggests that AC is dangerous and engages in a publicity war, while Westinghouse stands behind the technical merits of AC. As Edison struggles to find ways to make DC more affordable, Westinghouse attempts to get the high- voltage AC system to work with motors. Edison's wife dies, and Westinghouse is also struck with personal tragedy when his friend Franklin Pope dies in an electrical accident. Both face significant financial risk. To generate funds Edison commercially sells his speaking machine \\"The Phonograph\\". To damage the reputation of AC, Edison shows that it easily electrocutes animals, and secretly works to help the creators of execution by electric chair, despite his previous objections to manufacturing weapons or other machines of death. The first person to die by electrocution is William Kemmler, and newspapers label the event as \\"Far Worse Than Hanging\\". Westinghouse discovers Edison's involvement and reveals it to the press. After an unsuccessful attempt to strike out on his own, Tesla is approached by Westinghouse to work together, and build a practical AC motor. Edison is increasingly marginalized and J. P. Morgan merges Edison Electric into General Electric. The competing systems come to a head as they both put forward proposals to illuminate the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Samuel Insull presents the bid on behalf of Edison, and Westinghouse presents his competing bid. The abundantly lit fair is revealed. Westinghouse was successful. At the fair Westinghouse and Edison meet briefly. Edison discusses what it was like to achieve a great invention, and suggests that his next invention (motion pictures) could be so incredible that people might forget his name was ever associated with electricity.  Cast   Production  Michael Mitnick began writing the script for The Current War in 2008, basing it on the real life \\"war of the currents\\" AC/DC conflict between Edison and Westinghouse. Sonia Shechet Epstein, The Current War: Interview with Writer Michael Mitnick, Museum of the Moving Image, scienceandfilm.org, September 6, 2017 The screenplay is the conclusive result of sixty drafts, a ten-year writing process, first as a musical and finally as a film. In 2011 Mitnick's screenplay made the Black List, an industry survey of \\"most liked\\" screenplays not yet produced. On May 3, 2012, it was reported that Timur Bekmambetov's company, Bazelevs, had acquired the rights to Mitnick's screenplay. Bekmambetov was set to direct. On March 31, 2014, it was reported that Ben Stiller was in negotiations to direct the film. As of September 24, 2015, Benedict Cumberbatch and Jake Gyllenhaal were in talks to play Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse, respectively, with Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (Me and Earl and the Dying Girl) eyed to direct the film. Sacha Baron Cohen was also briefly linked to the role of Edison. On September 29, 2016, Michael Shannon was cast as Westinghouse, and on October 4, Nicholas Hoult was cast as Nikola Tesla. In November 2016, Katherine Waterston and Tom Holland joined the cast. The following month, Tuppence Middleton and Matthew Macfadyen were cast. Principal photography began on December 18, 2016, and took place in London and the surrounding areas, as well as Rothbury, Northumberland, where Cragside House was used as a location. Filming also took place at Brighton Pavilion. Home Farm in Kent, England was used as the exterior of Edison's residence. The film was submitted to the Toronto International Film Festival before post-production was completed, and was subsequently rushed in order to make the late-September 2017 premiere date. Following the generally unfavorable reception towards the film, director Gomez-Rejon, who had voiced the film was not ready to be seen, began working on trimming the runtime for the planned November 2017 theatrical release. After the sexual abuse allegations against Weinstein came to light, work on the film ceased as The Weinstein Company would eventually sell off the rights. Thanks to a clause in executive producer Martin Scorsese's contract, he had to approve all final cuts of the film, which resulted in Gomez-Rejon's being able to raise $1 million to complete post-production, as well as do one day of reshoots in England with Cumberbatch, Middleton and Hoult, rounding out their characters. Release The film was originally scheduled to be released by The Weinstein Company on December 22, 2017, and then rescheduled for November 24, 2017. It had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2017. It was pulled from release following the sexual abuse allegations that arose against Harvey Weinstein, then co-head of the company. Weinstein said that he was involved in the re-editing of the film when it was made known that the allegations would be revealed. In October 2018, Lantern Entertainment, which acquired The Weinstein Company's assets through its bankruptcy, and 13 Films, an international distribution and finance company, struck a deal to co-distribute the film internationally. In April 2019, it was announced 101 Studios had acquired distribution rights to the film for $3 million, and committed to a wide release. Director Gomez-Rejon said since the Toronto premiere he had added five additional scenes and trimmed ten minutes from the runtime. It was released on July 26, 2019, in the UK and October 25, 2019, in the US, after being previously scheduled for October 4. The theatrical release included the subtitle \\"The Director's Cut\\" in all countries but the UK. = Home media = The film was first released on DVD, Blu-Ray and digital download in the UK by Entertainment in Video on November 18, 2019. In the United States, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released the film for digital download on March 17, 2020 and later on DVD and Blu-Ray on March 31, 2020. Reception =Box office= The Current War grossed $6 million in the United States and Canada, and $6.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $12.3 million, against a production budget of $30 million. In the United States and Canada, The Current War was released alongside Black and Blue and Countdown, and was projected to gross around $3 million from 1,020 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $947,000 on its first day and went on to debut to $2.7 million, finishing ninth at the box office, although it was noted that it was \\"a miracle that this Alfonso Gomez-Rejon-directed movie made its way to the big screen and wasn‚Äôt jettisoned to streaming, or unseen forever\\". =Critical response= Original release On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the version of the film screened at Toronto International Film Festival has an approval rating of 31% based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 4.80/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Current War is powered by an outstanding cast and an intriguing, history- inspired story, which makes this drama's low wattage all the more shocking.\\"On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-current-war-1 Reviewing the film after its 2017 premiere, David Rooney for The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"For all its aggressive energy, The Current War is an uninvolving bore, making it unlikely to measure up as the kind of Oscar-baity prestige entry The Weinstein Co. obviously had in mind.\\" Also reviewing the original cut, Andrew Barker of Variety called the film \\"flashy but unilluminating\\" and saying that \\"so little of The Current Wars hustle and bustle serves much of a concrete purpose... The Current War feels like one of those earlier experiments ‚Äì temporary flash providing too little illumination.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"This [is] a watchably stylised period film, with interesting visual setpieces and faces looming up at us out of intricately contrived backgrounds.\\" He concluded that the film \\"is illuminating ‚Äì but perhaps not quite as much as it could have been.\\" Dan Jolin of Empire magazine called the film a \\"stylish portrayal of a literal power struggle based on truly interesting historical figures and events. But it tries to take in too much in too little time, when all it needed was to centre on Edison and Westinghouse.\\" Director's Cut On Rotten Tomatoes, the Director's Cut version of the film has an approval rating of 61% based on 104 reviews, with an average rating of 6.39/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"If it lacks the powerful voltage that its impressive cast suggests, The Current War: Director's Cut represents a significant improvement over previous versions.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 81%. Michael Phillips, writing for the Chicago Tribune, gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, writing, \\"I never saw the earlier version [of the film].

Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER) refers to a company's duties to abstain from damaging natural environments. The term derives from corporate social responsibility (CSR). Background The environmental aspect of CSR has been debated over the past few decades, as stakeholders increasingly require organizations to become more environmentally aware and socially responsible. In the traditional business model, environmental protection was considered only in relation to the \\"public interest\\". Hitherto, governments had maintained principal responsibility for ensuring environmental management and conservation. The public sector has been focused on the development of regulations and the imposition of sanctions as a means to facilitating environmental protection. Recently, the private sector has adopted the approach of co-responsibility towards the prevention and alleviation of environmental damage. The sectors and their roles have been changing, with the private sector becoming more active in the protection of the environment. Many governments, corporations, and big companies are now providing strategies for environmental protection and economic growth. The World Commission on Environment published the Brundtland Report in 1987 to address sustainable development. Since then, managers, scholars, and business owners have tried to determine why and how big corporations should incorporate environmental aspects into their own policies. In recent years, an increasing number of companies have pledged to protect natural environments. Relations to corporate social responsibility There are different perceptions of CSR between government, the private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and society in general, and thus, the concept has no single definition. CSR may cover: * a company running its business responsibly in relation to internal stakeholders (shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers); * the role of business in relation to the state (locally and nationally) as well as to inter-state institutions or standards; and * business performance as a responsible member of the society in which it operates and the global community.\\" The European Union defines CSR as \\"...the concept that an enterprise is accountable for its impact on all relevant stakeholders. It is the continuing commitment by a business to behave fairly and responsibly and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and their families as well as of the local community and society at large.\\" According to this definition, a CSR strategy is more focused on social aspects, particularly the interests of stakeholders. CER is, in many ways, connected to CSR, as both of them influence environmental protection. CER, however, is strictly about the consideration of environmental implications and protection within corporate strategy. The understanding of CER cannot be separated from CSR--both are interconnected and based on environmental protection. There are three major areas related to these two concepts-- economic, environmental and social. CER is focused more on economic and environmental while CSR relates to social and environmental aspects. Economy, society, and environment all play significant roles in the development of an efficient and effective company strategy. Main elements These cover the environmental implications of a company's operations: * Eliminate waste and emissions * Maximize the efficient use of resources and productivity * Minimize activities that might impair the enjoyment of resources by future generations. Drivers and challenges Among the main drivers for CER are government policies and regulations. Many states provide their own legislation, regulations and policies, which are important in creating a positive environmental attitude within companies. Subsidies, tariffs and taxes play a vital role in the implementation of these policies. Another significant factor is the competitive environment among companies generated by media, public, shareholder and NGO awareness, which are also major drivers of CER. Challenges include the cost of regulation and difficulties in predicting economic gains, which could become problematic for a company's management. Additionally, new technologies are frequently too expensive for a lot of companies. Another challenge is the lack of harmonization of regulations among different states--often there is a mosaic of propositions, leading to unclear strategies for environmental behavior, especially in multinational corporations.  Worldwide Perspectives on Corporate Environmental Responsibility  The majority of international CSR studies focus on business practices and its aspects, such as business economics and the legality of environmental law. Most companies are noticing the importance of taking into account one of its most important stakeholders: employees and customers and their commitment to sustainability. Studies have demonstrated that once companies place sustainability practices they can be directly linked to financial success and customer satisfaction, which in turn can be used as a marketing tool. Although every country has a different culture, and each country determines their own scale of environmental responsibility, research has shown that there is a standard global human values that drive customer needs and wants. Companies have taken initiatives to take sustainability and align it with each company's economic goals. Managers and other people at the top, play the key role in decision-making and implementing the firm's sustainability practices.  Benefits of Corporate Environmental Responsibility  Corporate social responsibility can prove to be more profitable for companies and to extend it survivability in markets because greater awareness on this topic, in both social and business markets, has been in higher demand. Customers have responded with overall satisfaction and loyalty when companies have a better CSR, especially in countries like Spain and Brazil. Culture has an impact on the CSR ratings and studies, as well as human values across different nations. This topic can also be found under sustainable development. This area is concerned with not only protecting the environment but maintaining economical growth. There were several agreements internationally to help adopt new business practices that held these standards, but they were considered individual and there was no law-abiding body to regulate nor implement them. One of the other factors that is considered an integral part of sustainable development are human beings, and specific groups and their habitat. Counties and companies that more developed would lead, and other small countries and business would slowly make gains. It is important to recognize that just because corporate environmental responsibility is being recognized that consumption is something that is not discouraged. The idea of corporate environmental responsibility (CER) is for humans to be more aware of the environmental impact and counteract their pollution/carbon footprint on the natural resources. One of the main factors is to reduce carbon footprint and carbon emissions. Many of the studies focus on trying to find a balance between economic growth and reducing waste and cleaner environments. Summary The environmental aspects of security have increasingly become a major issue being considered by states. The process of securitization has had a big impact in creating a new understanding of security. Globalization also plays a key role in the adoption of new environmental strategies as a multi-faceted process influencing modern societies, and creating interconnected and multidimensional environments. CER is used by multinational corporations as well as small, local organizations. It is highlighted and more institutionalized because of stakeholders' awareness of the huge impacts of business activities on the environment. To understand CER, its relations with CSR strategies need to be recognized. CER and CSR are the main strategies that help in the creation of efficient and environmentally sustainable businesses.

It was designed in 1879 by William Swinden Barber when the parish of Ripley was split to create the additional parish of Killinghall, and a new building was required to accommodate a growing congregation. It was opened in 1880. Among the early vicars posted in this benefice were two canons, Sydney Robert Elliston and Lindsay Shorland- Ball, and the Venerable Robert Collier, an Irish missionary who served in India and Africa. Context, funding and founding Before St Thomas' was built, the Anglicans of Killinghall were obliged to walk to Ripley church every Sunday, making attendance difficult for the elderly and infirm. In latter years the schoolroom at Killinghall was licensed for public worship, but as the Bishop of Ripon said, \\"There were not those influences about it which belonged to a consecrated building.\\" In the 1870s the village of Killinghall, in the parish of Ripley, was increasing in size, and by 1879 had a population of 6,200 who needed a church closer than the one at Ripley. Killinghall consequently became a separate parish. The endowment for this parish came from the sale of a glebe farm at Ripley.London Gazette, no.24791, p.7319: Friday 12 December 1879 More than an acre of land for the church and its approaches was donated by Dr and Mrs Beaumont of Knaresborough, and donations were given by local landowners and friends of the project. This allowed the church committee to plan a vicarage also. Beaumont later agreed to sell the adjoining two acres of land to the committee for ¬£200, and this was earmarked for the burial ground. The committee received a grant of ¬£1,500 from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and expected to have to raise ¬£3,000 for a church building to accommodate 400‚Äì500 persons, and ¬£1,500 for the vicarage. However, in return for the vicarage grant, the new vicar Reverend R.K. Smith had to pay the Commissioners ¬£214 per annum. This sum equalled the whole of his stipend, apart from the use of the vicarage which was not yet built. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday 28‚Äì30 August 1879, a bazaar was held under the auspices of Miss Ingilby of Ripley Castle, to raise over ¬£300 towards the cost of the church. This event was designed to attract the gentry of Harrogate, who arrived in large numbers by carriage.The York Herald (York, England), Tuesday, 2 September 1879; pg. 7; Issue 7036. British Library Newspapers, Part II: 1800‚Äì1900: \\"Local and District, Harrogate\\" By July 1880, the cost of the church building had risen to over ¬£4,000, raised by subscription and fundraising.Pateley Bridge and Nidderdale Herald, 31 July 1880: \\"Killinghall: consecration of a new church at Killinghall\\". On microfilm at Victoria Library, Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England By 1930, the value of the building was estimated at ¬£14,000, and by 1980 the value was ¬£400,000. Building North-east corner The foundation stone was laid on Saturday 26 April 1879 by Sir Henry Day Ingilby of Ripley Castle, witnessed by an audience of 300.The Hull Packet and East Riding Times (Hull, England), Friday, 2 May 1879; Issue 4889. British Library Newspapers, Part I: 1800‚Äì1900 \\"District News\\"The York Herald (York, England), Saturday, 3 May 1879; pg. 5; Issue 6932. British Library Newspapers, Part II: 1800‚Äì1900: \\"District News: Harrogate\\" The church was designed in the style of the second or Curvinilear Period of Decorated Gothic of 1290 to 1350. Due to cost, the decoration of capitals and vaulting are minimal or non-existent, but there is some tracery in the windows, and varied carved finials under some arches. The church is built of dressed ashlar blocks of Killinghall stone, while the boundary wall, also built in 1880, has contrasting rough coping to blend with the contemporary local style. The west wall faces the highway, and has two aisle-end, two-light windows, whose tracery is in the form of a Canterbury cross. The North Porch is surmounted by a St Thomas Cross. The remaining windows of the church have trefoil lights or are plain lancets, except for the east window which has four lights. The north porch is square, and faced what was then the most populous part of the village. However the porch was converted into a lavatory around 2015. The mason was James Simpson of Harrogate, who constructed several local buildings of stone from Killinghall quarry, including the adjacent Methodist Chapel (1869). According to Killinghall historian Colin Waite, \\"It could well be that James used the same stone to build St Thomas's,\\" and the Pateley Bridge and Nidderdale Herald's 1880 article about the consecration said that it was local stone. James Simpson was the father of David Simpson, who was mayor of Harrogate four times, who built Harrogate's Grand Hotel (1903), and who developed Harrogate's Duchy Estate for the Duchy of Lancaster. The carpenter and joiner was William Bellerby of York.William Bellerby was a pupil of George Fowler Jones Mr Baynes of Ripon was the slater, and Mr Fortune of Harrogate was the plasterer. John Naylor of Halifax was the plumber and glazier. The painters were Hirst and Barraclough of Brighouse. Mr Rawe of Ripley was clerk of the works. The value of work and materials as of 1880 was around ¬£3,000. The bells =Bells and clock= The bellcote contains two bells. The larger one, original to the church and measuring , was founded in 1879 by Mears and Stainbank. It is hung for use with a bellrope, being in its original position within the bellcote, with a full metal wheel. The smaller one is connected to the clock, which as of 2016 was awaiting repair. This bell measures and was founded by John Taylor of Loughborough, possibly in the 1930s when the turret clock mechanism was installed. It has been added at a lower level on the east side of the bellcote, and is struck by a clock hammer. Both bells are inscribed with the maker's name, and the larger one has the date 1879.Ripon and Leeds Bells: Killinghall St Thomas the Apostle SE285584 The clock bell, clock face and turret mechanism by Potts of Leeds was donated by the daughters of George Lewis, who died aged 91 in 1932, having served as churchwarden for 41 years. =Interior= Font by Charles Mawer, showing square symbolising Thomas the Apostle Between the nave and the north and south aisles are two arcades each of four doubly-chamfered arches, supported by circular columns with octagonal capitals. The chancel floor is three steps above that of the nave. It contains choir stalls designed by the architect William Swinden Barber on either side, and in a 1905‚Äì1908 chancel reordering these were augmented by two clergy seats and two prayer desks for the choir. The original choir stalls were described in 1880 as being \\"plain but very solid construction\\", like the nave pews which were also designed by the architect. On the south side of the chancel is the organ chamber, and on the north side is the vestry which has access through the north wall and into the chancel. The chancel arch was built \\"as lofty as possible\\", being the \\"chief internal feature of the structure\\". All the woodwork is made of pitch pine, and was originally treated or varnished to appear as close as possible to its natural colour, although the roof timbers looked warmer than the pews when new. The nave is by , and the north and south aisles are by . The chancel is by . The organ chamber contained no organ at first, when it measured internally by . At the consecration, a harmonium was used in default of the absent organ, and the church still contains a harmonium which may date back to 1880. The font and pulpit, designed by the architect and sculpted by Charles Mawer of Leeds,Charles Mawer (active 1861‚Äì1881) carved the capitals in St Matthews Lightcliffe, also designed by Barber are made of Caen stone, and were paid for by Lady Ingilby. The nave and chancel originally had plain brass gas lamp standards made by Hardman's Works, and there was hot-air heating apparatus supplied by Grundy. The books were given by Mrs and the Misses Lloyd of Hazelcroft. Plate used for communion service was given by Mrs W. Strother, and the chairs in the chancel were given by Mr H. Cautley. The surplices and linen were given by the vicar of Killinghall Reverend R.K. Smith and his wife. Thomas Strother presented the altar in memory of his mother who died in 1863. Dinah Cautley (d.1910) paid for the oak chancel screen in 1905. Organ The pipe organ, built by William Andrews of Bradford, was installed in 1908. It has a carved oak case, copperplate script on ivory drawstops and a radiating and concave pedalboard. It was renovated in 1992 by J.M. Spinks of Leeds.The National Pipe Organ Register (NPOR) V2.15: Thomas the Apostle Otley Road Killinghall no.2776 Dinah Cautley (d.1910) donated the two- manual organ, which in its time was one of the largest in Nidderdale. 2nd Lieut Strother Memorial plaques There is a brass plaque presented by Lady Ingilby in memory of churchwarden George Lewis (d.1932). There are three memorial tablets commemorating the Strother family, including John Marmaduke Strother MC, Second Lieutenant, killed in action aged 24 in 1917. He is also remembered on the Arras Memorial and the Killinghall War Memorial. His tablet was engraved by Jesper of Harrogate. Dinah Cautley, a major benefactor to the church, has a tablet in the nave to her memory, recording her death in 1910 at age 79. She was the aunt of Henry Cautley MP. There is a tablet dedicated to a judge, Frederick McCulloch Jowitt CBE (d.1921). There is a tablet in honour of Arthur Keightley Smith (1886‚Äì1942), son of the church's first vicar, who was lost at sea near Sumatra in World War II. Canon Elliston (d.1943), the church's second vicar, and the organist George Thomas Woods, are also remembered with a tablet. William Watson Mitchell (d.1933) also has a tablet in his memory. 1905‚Äì1908 re-ordering Hodgson Fowler's 1905 chancel screen In 1905, Canon Elliston and churchwardens Andus Hirst and George Lewis petitioned the Bishop of Ripon William Boyd Carpenter for a faculty to take down and remove the altar and rails, the clergy choir stalls and the prayer desks from the chancel. The wanted to remove the communion rail steps under the chancel arch, and all of the floor east of them. They wanted to raise the chancel floor by four inches, and to replace the chancel steps with Pateley Bridge stone. They planned a new chancel floor of the same stone, laid in squares and diamonds. There would be a new chancel screen, and an asphalt concrete floor overlaid with pitch pine under the choir stalls. They wanted a new altar of Austrian wainscot oak, and rails around it. Above the altar, they planned a retable with brass cross, flower vases and candlesticks. They wanted a wooden dado around the three chancel walls. They wanted to re-fix Barber's original pitch-pine choir stalls, but planned additional pitch pine seats for clergy, and new desks for the choir boys. They wanted a new carved oak chancel screen with a cross on top. They also wanted wrought iron gates in the chancel screen \\"to prevent the entrance of strangers into the chancel, who visit the church during the summer months, when it is left open for private prayer.\\" The cost was estimated at ¬£265, to be raised by voluntary contribution (in the event the cost of the chancel screen was donated by Dinah Cautley). They stated that the congregation had approved these plans. Elliston was given permission on 10 November 1905. to complete the project within the following three years.West Yorkshire Archive service, Morley: Document RD/AF2/19/26 (1905) Killinghall faculty William Swinden Barber, who had originally designed the building, had retired and moved to Hampshire, so C.

Her book shows a line from the Song of Zechariah. It translates as \\"You, my son, shall be called the prophet of the most high.\\" (Luke 1:68‚Äì79). The child John is looking at baby Jesus in the other window light, and he holds the words \\"agnus dei\\" or Lamb of God. The left-hand light shows the Madonna and Child, and everybody is looking at John. This window was given by parishioners in memory of Amelia Tanner, the wife of Reverend Elliston. The three-light window on the south aisle illustrates Matthew 4.24: \\"And they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments.\\" This window was given by Dinah Cautley in 1887 in memory of her husband William, a doctor of obstetrics. The Cautleys lived in the Manor House where the Cautley estate (built 1960s) now stands in Killinghall. The two-light window at the east end of the south aisle was given in 1887 in memory of Mary Ann Wray by her Daughter Dinah Cautley.\\" This window shows the Annunciation on the left, and the Resurrection on the right. It is possible that the bottom right figure is Thomas the Apostle. =Chancel= The east window In the two-light window on the north side of the chancel, the left light features the Raising of Lazarus story (John 11:1‚Äì44). The text says \\"Lazarus come forth\\" (John 11.43) and \\"Jesus wept\\" (John 11.35). The second light illustrates the story of the Raising of the son of the widow of Nain (Luke 7:11‚Äì17) This window was dedicated to William Strother by his mother. The Strothers were major landowners in the village area, living locally at Low Hall, Kennel Hall Farm and Westfield. The east window was made by Cox & Son. The design of the central two lights is based on John 20:24‚Äì29, the story of Doubting Thomas. In this image, Thomas (shown kneeling at bottom of second light from left) has finally seen the Resurrection and checked the wounds, and he now believes in it. The top part of the window consists of three small rose lights, containing symbols. The left symbol is the Paschal Lamb, a heraldic symbol in which the Lamb of God carries the cross of St. George. The right- hand rose shows a pelican vulning, a heraldic symbol (a crest in this case) of a self-sacrificing pelican feeding her young with the blood from her breast, symbolising the Passion. This medieval symbol was superseded by the Lamb and Flag. The image in the uppermost rose shows the intertwined Alpha and Omega. Thomas Strother, who paid for this window, dedicated it to his wife or mother, and died while the church was in process of construction. The two-light window on the north side of the chancel is dedicated to Thomas Strother (1806‚Äì1879) by his widow. The left-hand light represents St Peter, carrying the Keys of Heaven, with his book at his feet, symbolising the Scriptures. The angel below him carries the words, \\"Rejoice in the lord alway\\" (Paul's Epistle to the Philippians 4:4). The right hand light shows Paul the Apostle carrying a sword symbolising his martyrdom, with the Scriptures in the form of a book at his feet. The angel below him has the words \\"The just shall live by faith\\" (Paul's Epistle to the Romans 1:17). =North aisle= The King David window The two- light window at the east end of the north aisle represents Mary and Martha of Bethany, mentioned in Luke 38‚Äì42. In that story, Mary is interested in spiritual matters, whereas Martha prefers to do practical work. Thus Martha has a housekeeper's attributes of a spinning wheel and a purse at her waist, while Mary is praying and reading the Scriptures. This window is dedicated to Ann Mitchell, the village postmistress, by her husband. The three-light window on the north aisle carries the theme of evangelism and music. It shows King David in the centre light, playing music. The left-hand light carries the words, \\"Their sound is gone out unto all lands,\\" and the right-hand light says \\"and their words into the ends of the world.\\" This is a translation of the 4th and 5th lines of Psalm 19, as it appears in the Book of Common Prayer: day 4, morning prayer. The men on either side of David are both saints with halos, and churchmen, wearing mitres. The dedication for this window is missing, but it was said by a local newspaper to have been given by William Clapham Cautley, and that it is dedicated to George Thomas Woods of the Order of Saint John. Woods was church organist for 24 years. =West wall= Part of west window The western aisle-end windows are alike. The stonework of the apex of each window on the outside is in the form of a Canterbury cross. The coloured glass around the cross is painted with a stylised sunburst. The two large lights forming the main part of the windows have no coloured glass, allowing full light, especially on the font in the south aisle. The west window consists of two sets of two lights. The small rose light in the right-hand window has the Star of David, and the rose in the left-hand window has the IHS symbol, derived originally from the first three letters of Jesus' name in ancient Greek, but usually translated as \\"Christ the Redeemer\\". This window was made by Cox and Son,Cox and Son (active 1838‚Äì1881)Stained glass in Wales: Cox & Son, who supplied the east and west windows in 1880 and paid for by the rector of Ripley, Reverend T.C. Thompson. Architect William Swinden Barber FRIBA (1832‚Äì1908) was an architect who specialised in Gothic Revival Anglican churches, working mainly in Brighouse and Halifax. He is credited with at least 16 Grade II listed buildings. Several of his designs for churches with bell-gables were completed in 1880, the same year as St Thomas the Apostle. As with the pews, the Caen stone pulpit and the font in this building, Barber often designed the fittings himself, commissioning them from local Arts and Crafts woodcarvers and sculptors. Consecration Bishop Robert Bickersteth The building was consecrated by Robert Bickersteth, Bishop of Ripon (1816‚Äì1884), on Thursday 29 July 1880.Pateley Bridge and Nidderdale Herald, Friday 15 August 1980: \\"Notes from Nidderdale\\" by Chad. On microfilm at North Yorkshire County Record Office, Northallerton, microfilm 3253, frame no.02296.Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer West Yorkshire, England 30 July 1880 p5: \\"Consecration of Killinghall Church\\"Yorkshire Gazette North Yorkshire, England 31 July 1880 p7: \\"Consecration of Killinghall Church\\" The Pateley Bridge and Nidderdale Herald described the scene thus: > \\"The weather remained comparatively fine during the whole of the day, and > the little village presented quite an animated appearance, the constant > stream of brilliant equipages, the uneasing flow of pedestrians proceeding > from all directions towards the new church, and bunting copiously displayed > from the houses denoting the importance with which the event was regarded in > the surrounding district. The church was crowded to excess with a very > brilliant assemblage.\\" The \\"brilliant assemblage\\" was listed in order of importance, led by Sir Henry Day and Lady Ingilby and their party from Ripley Castle, Lady Amootta Ingilby, Lady Bickersteth the wife of the Bishop of Ripon, various moneyed persons who had donated to the church building fund, and Professor Salmon of Dublin. These were followed by the local priests in their vestments, and the doctor: Reverend T.C. Thompson of Ripley, Reverend J.H. Huddleston, Reverend F. Houseman, and Dr Veale. East wall of church The bishop was welcomed at the north porch by wardens Thomas Smith and William Strother, and Sir H.D. Ingilby presented the petition for consecration. The procession of wardens, Mr Wise the diocesan registrar, the bishop and 23 clergymen then proceeded to the chancel. Among the clergymen were Reverend Canon Gibbon of Harrogate, Canon Crosthwaite of Knaresborough, Rev. R.K. Smith of Killinghall, Rev. G.O. Brownrigg of Harrogate, Rev. F.L. Harrison of Pannal, Rev. H. Deck of Hampsthwaite, Rev. Cope of Bramley, J.G.B. Knight of Birstwith, Rev. Faulkner of Bishop Monkton, Rev. Lucas of Hartwith, Rev. J.J. Pulleine of Kirby Wiske (chaplain to the bishop), Rev. Patchett of Sawley, Rev. Horsfall of Dacre, and Rev. B.K. Wood of Bilton. Smith, Pulleine, Brownrigg and Gibbon assisted the bishop in the service. The Killinghall choir was augmented by the Ripley choristers, and Fred Mitchell played the harmonium. The text for the bishop's sermon was the 8th verse of Psalm 26: \\"Lord I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.\\" He commented that \\"no excuse could now be made\\" that the congregation \\"had no church immediately at hand.\\" He said it was \\"his earnest hope that those for whom the church had been erected would show their thankfulness by availing themselves constantly of those privileges which would be there accorded them.\\" He ended by saying that donations on that day would be applied first to the remaining debt for the cost of building the church, and the balance would be kept towards the future building of a vicarage. The collection raised ¬£40. In the afternoon after the service there was a sale of work in the schoolroom, raising a sum between ¬£20 and ¬£25 in aid of the building fund. 200 local people were entertained to a tea to which the journalist of the Pately Bridge and Niddertale Herald was presumably invited, since he described it as a \\"great success\\". This was followed by an evening service held by the Dean of Ripon, the Reverend R.K. Smith vicar of Killinghall, Reverend J.J. Pulleine and Reverend H. Deck. The collection on this occasion raised more than ¬£7 towards the building fund. Accident Since the bells and organ had not yet been installed, it is probable that the mason James Simpson was still working on the same building on 9 August 1880. On that day his employee Anthony Carrow at Killinghall slipped from scaffolding, fell \\"a considerable distance\\" and sustained \\"a somewhat serious fracture of the thigh.\\" He was taken to the Cottage Hospital at Harrogate, and by the following Wednesday he was \\"progressing favourably.\\"York Herald North Yorkshire, England 11 August 1880 p7: \\"Local and District, Harrogate, Fall from a building\\" Bicentenary and centenary celebrations The bicentenary of the parish and church building was celebrated in 1930, the service being held by Reverend Canon Sydney Robert Ellison, the second vicar of the parish. On Tuesday 29 July 1980, a celebratory centenary service was held at the church by Reverend David Young, Bishop of Ripon. Afterwards, Sir Thomas C.W. Ingilby cut the cake. At the centenary it was noted by local historian and churchwarden Mrs K.J. Russell that the Church of St Thomas the Apostle had recorded 1,437 baptisms, 491 marriages and 1,077 interments. Graveyard 19th-century monuments The burial ground was consecrated directly after the consecration service for the church building, on 29 July 1880. The first burials took place in 1880, and these continued at least until 1993.Federation of Family History Societies: National Burial Index, Coverage Yorkshire West Riding Dinah Cautley and her husband, major benefactors of the church, have a prominent grave here. Vicarage The old vicarage was built on Otley Road between 1880 and 1882, possibly designed by William Swinden Barber. Fetes and garden parties used to take place in its grounds. It was sold in 1976 when the parish was combined with Hampsthwaite, where the incumbent would now be living. Services, events and facilities Services take place on most Sundays at 9.30 am at St Thomas the Apostle, except for the fourth Sunday of the month. This is a joint benefice service at 11 am rotating around Killinghall, Birstwith, Hampsthwaite and Felliscliffe churches. The Book of Common Prayer is used at the services. There is a Sunday school in the village hall every first Sunday of the month. There is Holy Communion every first and second Sunday of the month, and all age worship on the third Sunday of the month at the same time. During school term time, there is tea and toast early on Tuesday mornings, followed by prayers. Every second Tuesday of the month, except during February, there is a mums and tots session in the church, with a coffee and cake session for all in the afternoon. The church has a regular choir, and hosts live music concerts. The church is available for hire for concerts and other events.A Church Near You.

The Andes region of Pre- Columbian South America was dominated by the Tiwanaku civilization until about 1200, when the regional kingdoms of the Aymara emerged as the most powerful of the ethnic groups living in the densely populated region surrounding Lake Titicaca. Power struggles continued until 1450, when the Incas incorporated upper Bolivia into their growing empire. Based in present-day Peru, the Incas instituted agricultural and mining practices that rivaled those put in place many years later by European conquerors. They also established a strong military force, and centralized political power. Despite their best efforts however, the Incas never completely controlled the nomadic tribes of the Bolivian lowlands, nor did they fully assimilate the Aymara kingdoms into their society. These internal divisions doomed the Inca Empire when European conquerors arrived.  Earliest cultures  Various cultures of indigenous peoples in Bolivia developed in the high altitude settings of altiplano, where they coped with low oxygen levels, poor soils and extreme weather patterns. The more temperate and fertile lowlands were sparsely inhabited by hunter- gatherer societies. Much of the pre-Columbian population was concentrated in the altiplano valleys of Cochabamba and Chuquisaca. The potato was domesticated near lake Titicaca between 8000 and 5000 BC, quinoa some 3000‚Äì4000 years ago, and production of copper began in 2000 BC. Llama, alpaca and vicu√±a were also domesticated and used for transport, food and clothing. The site of Jisk'a Iru Muqu was first investigated by modern researchers in 1994. A necklace consisting of nine gold beads was found in an excavated grave located next to a Terminal Archaic pit house. Charcoal recovered from the burial dates the gold beads to 2155-1936 cal BC The earliest known cultures in Bolivia were the Wankarani culture, and the Chiripa. The oldest Wankarani sites are dated from 1800 BC onwards.Jason (Jake) R. Fox, Time and Process in an Early Village Settlement System on the Bolivian Southern Altiplano.

'The Seventy Great Mysteries of the Ancient World: Unlocking the Secrets of Past Civilizations'. New York: Thames & Hudson, 2001. In around 400 AD the Tiwanaku empire began its expansion, appropriating the Yungas and establishing contacts with other cultures in Peru, Bolivia and Chile. By 600 AD it became an important regional power in the southern Andes.McAndrews, Timothy L. et al. \\"Regional Settlement Patterns in the Tiwanaku Valley of Bolivia\\". Journal of Field Archaeology 24 (1997): 67‚Äì83. Tiwanako then underwent a dramatic transformation between 600 and 700 AD that established new monumental standards in civic architecture for the region and greatly increased the resident population.Isbell, William H. 'Wari and Tiwanaku: International Identities in the Central Andean Middle Horizon'. 731‚Äì751. The Tiwanaku empire is believed to have absorbed cultures rather than eradicating them. Archaeologists have also seen a dramatic adoption of Tiwanaku ceramics amongst the cultures who became part of the empire. Tiwanaku strengthened its power over its domain through the trade implemented between all of the cities within the empire. The elites thereby gained status by collecting surplus food stocks from all the regions under their influence, and then redistributing it back to the people where needed. This made maintaining large llama herds essential, for carrying goods back and forth between the center of the empire and the periphery. In about 950 AD a dramatic shift in the regions' climate occurred.Kolata, Alan L. 'The Tiwankau: Portrait of an Andean Civilization'. Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, 1993. A significant drop in annual precipitation in the Titicaca Basin followed as a result, and many cities further away from Lake Titicaca with less access to water sources began to produce less crops, and diminishing surplus food stock to provide to the elites as a result. The immediate area surrounding the capital city and the lake eventually became the last source of substantial agricultural food production for the empire, due to the resiliency of the raised fields to efficiently produce food crops, but in the end even the intelligent design of the fields was no match for the changing climate. The Tiwanaku empire is believed to have dissolved around year 1000 AD when substantial food production ceased, and with it, the main source of power for the ruling elites dried up. The land was not inhabited again for many years after that.  Aymara kingdoms  Chullpas Between 1100 and 1460 AD the Aymaras developed a number of kingdoms in the region surrounding lake Titicaca, of which the Lupaca, Colla and Cana kingdoms were the largest. These were located farther inland in fortified towns (pucara), and chullpa burial and ceremonial towers still remain. Although the Aymaras were based, and prospered in, the harsh altiplano conditions they also controlled lands on eastern slopes of the Andes that were more suited for food production ‚Äì colonies were also established in lowland temperate and semitropical areas in order to grow adequate food stocks to sustain their populations. This type of society organization has been called the vertical archipelago. Aymara society was organized by ayllus, or kinship groups. An Ayllu was divided into two strata ‚Äì upper (hanansaya) and lower (urinsaya). The Aymaras also controlled and dominated the Uru and Puquina people, who had lived in the Andean region before the Aymaras, and by the 12th century they were reduced to the status of oppressed, landless workers subservient to the Aymaras. Aymara dominance in the region was however eventually challenged by the growing state of the Quechuas from Cuzco, who finally conquered them between 1460 and 1500 AD.  Inca empire  Flag of Qullasuyu The Incas conquered much of what is now western Bolivia under their ninth emperor Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui, whose reign lasted from 1438 to 1471 AD. Pachacuti Yupanqui was then succeeded by his son Topa Inca Yupanqui whose reign lasted from 1471 to 1493 AD. Western Bolivia became one of the four Incan territories within its empire known as Qullasuyu, with an estimated one million inhabitants.A Concise History of Bolivia The highest official of Qullasuyu ruled on behalf of the \\"Inca\\" (the emperor) and supervised a group of provincial governors, who in turn controlled the members of the Aymara nobility. Under a draft system called the Mit'a, the Incas forced the peoples under their domination to work in mines, on construction projects, or to serve in the armies. Surprisingly these draftees were compensated fully for their labor. Despite their policy of extreme centralization, the Incas did not fundamentally change the organization of the Aymara kingdoms, and these kingdoms remained relatively autonomous. Many local chiefs kept much of their power, and in general their rule was supported by Incan authority. The Aymara under these conditions were able to retain their culture, local religious practices, and their language. The regional nobility, although forced to send their children to Cuzco for education, also continued to hold private property. Moreover, the Aymara practice of developing new colonies in the eastern valleys and along the coast was tolerated under Incan rule. In 1470 AD several Aymara kingdoms began rebelling against the Incas. The Incas however completely defeated two Aymara states and pacified the region overall by sending mitimas, Quechua-speaking colonists, to Aymara territories particularly to the southern valleys and to the more central valley regions where Cochabamba and Sucre were later founded. By the beginning of the 16th century the Incas had fully reestablished their rule. Despite their renewed dominance, the Incas failed however to conquer the nomadic tribes in the eastern Bolivian lowlands. The remains of Incan fortresses here reveal evidence of this failure and suggest that Incas could subdue only those cultures based on agricultural activities. As a result of their resistance, the nomadic tribes in the eastern lowlands occupying two-thirds of Bolivia preserved their way of life to a great extent, even after the Spanish conquest. The independence and success of the Moxo people for instance was shown by their construction of elevated causeways to manage the regular floods in the region and to serve their population.

Sherri Cullison says of Rodriguez‚Äô work: ‚ÄúIsis feels she is free to use her privilege to tease, and she does it with acrylic electroshock therapy conceived in true street-level, riot grrl style.‚Äù Judy Chicago says of Rodriguez‚Äô 1996 painting ‚ÄúNo More‚Äù (a nude woman with a snarling tiger emerging from her vagina): ‚Äú[W]hile being able to celebrate the freedom of younger women artists like Isis Rodriguez, I have to‚Ä¶ acknowledge the discomfort that this image causes me.‚Äù Rodriguez‚Äô art is highly symbolic. Often, her paintings redefine traditional symbols. When a male reporter from Despertar de Oaxaca criticized Rodriguez‚Äô use of ski masks in her series ‚ÄúLa Mujer Enmascarada,‚Äù assuming it was an anachronic reference to zapatismo, Rodriguez countered, ‚Äú[T]he mask depends on your history and your personal experience. Maybe to you it represents zapatismo, but to an Esquimo it represents protection from the cold.‚Äù In 1999 Rodriguez told Artsy, ‚ÄúWhat interests me about my art is the creation of a female language made up of symbols and images in the hopes of establishing a woman‚Äôs voice without any apologies.‚Äù Another hallmark of Rodriguez‚Äô art is her frequent use of cartoons. In her early work, underground-style cartoons allow Rodriguez to make satirical commentaries about women‚Äôs issues. A good example is the painting ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù from the series ‚ÄúMy Life as a Comic Stripper‚Äù that pokes fun at the ‚ÄúMadonna/Whore complex‚Äù: a cartoon exotic dancer fantasizing about the Virgen de Guadalupe and a Harley Davidson, while male cartoon patrons such as Homer Simpson, Krusty the Clown, and Scooby Doo shower her with cash. In her later paintings, Rodriguez uses cartoons conceptually, rather than satirically. The oil and pastel series ‚ÄúEnter With Discretion‚Äù (previously called ‚ÄúLa Mujer Enmascarada‚Äù), features a realistically painted woman accompanied by a cartoon girl, challenging traditional distinctions between ‚Äúhigh‚Äù and ‚Äúlow‚Äù art. In Rodriguez‚Äô artist statement, she says: ‚ÄúThe cartoon is an elegant, minimalistic drawing of the realistic figure, and the realistic figure is just an over-rendered cartoon.‚Äù She also mentions that cartoons have a spiritual symbolism: ‚ÄúCartoons can guide us toward our inner fantasies, where we often retreat to cope with our conflicts.‚Äù  Art and Activism  While living in San Francisco, Rodriguez worked as an exotic dancer with several strip clubs, including the Lusty Lady, Century Theatre, Mitchell Brothers, and the Crazy Horse. Many of her early paintings criticize the strip club industry for its materialism and exploitation. Rodriguez donated use of her painting \\"Be All You Can Be\\" (a satirical army ad spoofing women‚Äôs limited gender roles) to the stripper rights organization Live Nude Girls Unite, which fought to reduce club stage fees and mandate safe working conditions for dancers. She was one of more than 500 plaintiffs in the 1994 class action lawsuit against the Mitchell Brothers, which was settled in the dancers‚Äô favor for $2.85 million in 1998.  Biography  Rodriguez was born in Los Angeles, California, and raised in Topeka, Kansas. She is the daughter of a Puerto Rican mother and a Mexican father. Rodriguez earned a bachelor of fine arts in painting from the University of Kansas in 1988 and went on to study for a year at the San Francisco Art Institute. Rodriguez lived in San Francisco until 2008, when she moved to Mexico. She currently lives in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico.  Works * 1997: ‚ÄúMy Life As A Comic Stripper.‚Äù This satirical series of gouache, acrylic, and ink cartoons is an activist‚Äôs perspective on women‚Äôs bodies and identities, as seen through the lens of San Francisco‚Äôs strip club industry. * 2005-2016: \\"Re-Diving Eve\\": In this series Isis uses a female, white cartoon image, reminiscent of Walt Disney style, to play the part of Eve, from the Adam and Eve story. Rodriguez has conceptually placed her in a moonlit dark paradise, surrounded by symbols from ‚ÄúThe Original Sin‚Äù. However, the Eve depicted here is free of blame, guilt, and shame, shown with an easy smile and soft eyes. * 2006: ‚ÄúGlyphtoons‚Äù. This series of acrylic and ink drawings on paper shows imagery related to exotic dancing, but unlike Rodriguez‚Äô earlier work, the series is introspective rather than activist. * 2008-Current: \\"Enter with Discretion\\". Continuing on an introspective, spiritual note, the oils and pastel paintings in this show feature a woman in a ski mask, lingerie, and other guises, moving through a space of darkness that Rodriguez calls nepantla, a state of spiritual transition and conflict.  Comics Rodriguez is the co-author with Alfonso L√≥pez de Anda of independent bilingual comic series Ni√±aj√≠. The comic was inspired by the Oaxacan legend of Donaj√≠, a princess who died in a war between the Mixtecs and the Zapotecs. Ni√±aj√≠ tells the story of a pre-Hispanic princess who is assassinated in a conflict between rival shamans, then reborn 500 years later to share her indigenous values with modern Mexico. ‚ÄúWhat makes our comic very special is the fact that it is spiritually based, from an indigenous perspective,‚Äù Rodriguez told the San Miguel de Allende newspaper Atenci√≥n.

It belongs to the Syro-Malabar Church under the archeparchy of Changanacherry. It is the first church in Asia dedicated to Saint Joseph  History  St. Thomas the Apostle landed in lush green Kerala which is lying between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats on the extreme end of India in 52 A.D. St. Thomas founded a Christian community which extended throughout Kerala by baptizing many people. It is popularly believed that as the community grew up, 7 churches namely, Maliankara, Palayoor, Paravoor (Kottakayal), Kokamangalam, Niranam, Chayal (Nilackal),Kollam and a half completed church at Thiruvankodu which were called ‚Äòezharapallika‚Äôl, were founded. Of these, Niranam situated close to the sea was very prominent. Christians from Niranam and Kuravilangadu and its neighbourhood immigrated to the present Kuttanadu which was abounded with kandal forests in those days- later this area was converted into fertile paddy fields-. Most of the immigrant Christians settled in Kalloorkadu area. They had to depend on the distant Niranam church for worship. As it had been extremely difficult to travel to Niranam, the faithful of Kalloorkadu erected a church in the locality in 427 A.D,Some 550 years passed by. In the meantime more and more Christians had immigrated to different parts of Kuttanadu. The Christians who had been living in scattered settlements in and around Chennamkary found it extremely hard to depend on Kalloorkadu church for worship. Therefore, the elders of 11 powerful families of Chennamkary, Nedumudi and Kainakari areas met and decided to erect a church in Chennamkary. After getting the required sanction from political and church authorities, a church was erected in Chennamkary with the united effort of the faithful on 1 August 977 A.D. Though it is not known for certain what materials were used for the construction of the church, it is generally believed that it was built with palm leaf and bamboo. Later in 1201, the main portion of the church was renovated with stone and lime mortar. The wings in the south and north were built in 1300. Later the southern wing was pulled apart to construct the cemetery. Prior to the construction of the cemetery, the dead were buried in different parts of the church yard. The ‚Äòmondalam‚Äô(roof) was constructed in 1601. Chennamkary had been included in the list of churches under the jurisdiction of Varapuzha Diocese published in 1786 which is entered in the History of Indian Church written by Rev.Fr. Xavier Koodapuzha. No other document about the history of Chennamkary church between 1800 and the famous Coonan cross Oath of 1653 is available.  St. Kuriakose Elias Chavara And Darsanathirunnal  St. Kuriakose Elias Chavara who is the pride of Kerala was born in Chennamkari parish in 1805 and was baptized at Chennamkari church. The granite baptismal font which witnessed the sacred rite still adorns the church. St. Kuriakose Elias Chavara was ordained in 1829. Through the efforts of Rev.Fr. kuriakose Elias, the first ... (Darsana samuham) dedicated to St. Joseph in India and Asia was founded in Chennamkari in 1836 vide the decree of Pope Gregory XVI which was sent through H.E. Mar Sauriar, the Bishop of Varapuzha Diocese. Those who assumed the Presidency of the Darsana samuham each year became the prasudenthi. The Sunday following 14 September (the thirunnal of the Veneration of the Cross), the Darsanathirunnal of St. Joseph is celebrated. The Darsanathirunnal has been conducted by prasudenthis without lapse except during the construction period of the present church building. As more unity and co-operation was required for the construction of the church building, the Darsanathirunnal had been conducted commonly by the parishners during the construction of the church.  The New Church  Though the ancient church was majestic, it began to show the signs of aging. Therefore, it was decided to pull apart the church and to build a new church during the tenure of Rev.Fr. Joseph Thumbayil. Rev. Fr. Thomas Kizhakkedath who succeeded Fr. Thumbayil established a fund for the renovation of the church. Under the leadership of his successor, Rev. Fr. Thomas Peelianickal and the convener, the old church was pulled apart. The construction of the new church began in 1994. The newly constructed church was consecrated on 21 December 1997 by H.E. Mar Joseph Powathil. Rev.Fr. Thomas Alumparampil who succeeded Fr. Peelianickal paid off the debts incurred due to the construction of the church and started a fund for the erection of a kodimaram(flag pole).A chapel was erected in the cemetery during his tenure. The manimalika at Chennamkari church is as reputed and ancient as Chennamkari church. Though the building had developed a slant, it enjoys a pride place in the heart of the parishners. The two storeyed vicarage was renovated under the leadership of Rev.Fr. Xavier Vettuthiruthel and the trustees in 1975.A new kodimaram (flag pole) much more beautiful but ancient looking similar to the former beautiful and famous kodimaram was erected under the leadership of the then vicar Rev.Fr. Joseph Poovathusseril and the convener in 2005.

Caracalla's Inscription (, also called ƒ∞skender Kitabesi) is a rock-carved ancient Roman inscription on the Taurus Mountains, southern Turkey dedicated to the Roman emperor Caracalla.

Formerly visible to the passers-by on the highway, it is not the case today due to the elevated level of the motorway constructed on place later on. The location is accessible taking the exit at Ak√ßatekir and following the regional road east of the motorway southwards about . Etymology of the inscription Locally, it is dubbed as the \\"ƒ∞skender Kitabesi\\" (\\"Alexander's Inscription\\"), although Alexander the Great lived about five centuries before Caracalla. The local name was most likely given due to the historical fact that Alexander the Great (reigned 331‚Äì323 BC) passed through the Cilician Gates proceeding for the Battle of Issus. Even though it revealed after its decryption that the inscription was dedicated to Caracalla (reigned 198‚Äì217 AD), the wrong local name still persists. The inscription The inscription was put up to memorize the road-widening construction of the mountain pass for the troops of Caracalla proceeding to the Parthian war in 216‚Äì17 AD.

Scepter of Judah: The Jewish Autonomy in the Eighteenth-Century Crown Poland, pp. 15-16The Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture, p. 118 (browse for \\"skhumot\\" online) The Jews were exempt from other state and municipal taxes, which often caused protests from Polish city dwellers. Initially the collection of the tax was a duty of Jewish Councils (Council of Four Lands, Council of the Land of Lithuania). Sometimes it was paid to the royal treasury, other times it was paid directly to the military units funded from this tax. The Jewish councils divide the tax into smaller internal divisions called \\"portions\\" (Hebrew: skhumot, Polish: sympla). The sum of the portions was always larger than the state-imposed amount, and the council used the surplus for the needs of Jewish community and the council apparatus. This practice was common for non-Jewish taxes as well, and the Crown was aware of it. By early 17th century the duty of Jewish poll tax was transferred to sejmiks, later to Polish military, and by mid-17th century it was absorbed into the hiberna.

Her research interests concern the characterization of meteoritic organic compounds in elucidating the evolution of planetary homochirality. Pizzarello is a project collaborator and co-investigator for the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI), the president of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life, and an emerita professor at Arizona State University (ASU). Early life and education Sandra Pizzarello was born in Venice, Italy in 1933. In 1955, she graduated summa cum laude from the University of Padua earning her Doctor of Biological Sciences degree under her adviser Professor Roncato. Pizzarello went on to work as a research associate developing tranquilizers for Farmitalia Research Laboratories in the Department of Neuropharmacology. Over the course of several years, Pizzarello transitioned from research to raising a family. Following a career opportunity for her husband, an aeronautical engineer and computer scientist, she moved her family to Phoenix, Arizona in 1970. Once Pizzarello's youngest of four children finished primary school, her focus returned to her career after a decade away from scientific research. She audited a graduate biochemistry seminar course at ASU where she met Professor John Cronin, future co- discoverer of amino acid enantiomeric excess in meteorites. Due to her outstanding performance in the course, she was offered a job to work with Cronin at the university as a research professor in analyzing the recently recovered Murchison meteorite. Research Sandra Pizzarello's research over the last forty years has involved the analysis of organic compounds in several carbonaceous chondrites, particularly molecular, chiral, and isotopic characterization of amino acids. Because the formation of these organic-rich meteorites pre-date the origin of life, they had been under investigation as potential sites of primal organic compounds which could shed light on abiogenesis, specifically the origin of biological homochirality. Such studies, however, had been inconclusive until 1997 when Cronin and Pizzarello detected 7-9% L-enantiomeric excesses of three abiological amino acids while analyzing the Murchison meteorite. Given Earth's history of meteoric impacts and the observation that meteors contain an excess of the biologically relevant L-stereoisomer of certain amino acids, Pizzarello studied the effect of meteoritic amino acids in enantiomeric excess on the formation of other biological molecules. In one study, Pizzarello found that nonracemic solutions of abiological isovaline and proteinogenic alanine can direct the condensation of glycolaldehyde to produce nonracemic solutions of threose and erythrose via an aldol reaction concluding that amino acids can act as asymmetric catalysts in carbohydrate synthesis. These findings support the origin of life hypothesis that homochirality originated prior to life and from extraterrestrial origins. However, Pizzarello's theoretical inquiries into cosmochemical evolution remain debated based on suspect analytical evidence of meteoritic enantiomeric excesses.

Location  Rieti railway station is located at the center of the city, just outside the medieval walls that enclose the historic city centre on its north side, and south of modern residential neighborhoods Regina Pacis, Madonna del cuore and Micioccoli.  History  DMU train in the station The station started operating on 30 October 1883, when the Rocca di Corno-Terni part of the Terni‚ÄìSulmona railway was opened. Upon construction, a 200 metres stretch of the nearby medieval walls were demolished, in order to create a new, large passage in the walls, so that arriving passenger could easily access the city centre. On 25 January 1944 the station was severely damaged in a bombing by USAF Flying Fortress, that also caused the death of the station master Antonio Uncini. Shortly after the building was reconstructed and the line restarted operations in 1946. In 2009 the former freight area, no longer used, was converted in a bus terminal and depot.  Train movements  Trains stopping in the station are regional trains running from Terni to L'Aquila, operated by Ferrovia Centrale Umbra company, on behalf of Trenitalia, with ALn 776 diesel multiple units. Even if there is no direct railway between Rieti and Rome, as the construction of such aa railway has been subject of a long debate but never took place, Rome can be reached by catching a train to the Terni station, where direct trains to Rome can be found.Trains departing from the station of Terni In addition, in recent years a direct train from Rieti to Rome, at early morning, and a direct train from Rome to Rieti, in the late evening, were introduced; both train pass through Terni, travel on the Ancona‚ÄìOrte railway, reach Orte and then travel on the Florence‚ÄìRome high- speed railway taking approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes.

She was the director of the Amalgamated Day Care and Health Center from 1969 to 1983, the first union-sponsored day care center in the United States. During this time, she was one of the founders of the Chicago branch of the Coalition of Labor Union Women and served as its president from 1978 to 1982. From 1983 to 1994 she served as the Assistant Director of Education and Political Action for the Chicago branch of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU). When ACTWU merged with the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) to form Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE), Tuteur served as the Assistant Education Director for the Chicago and Central States Board until her retirement. She received many awards and honors during her career, including the Hannah G. Solomon Award from the National Council of Jewish Women in 1988, and was an inductee into the Chicago Women's Hall of Fame in 1989. Early life Muriel \\"Manny\\" Friedman was born on May 17, 1922 in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, as the youngest child in a family of nine children of Romanian-Jewish immigrants. After completing her secondary education, Friedman enrolled in the University of Chicago. Career While still studying, in 1943, Friedman took a job as a milling machine operator at the South Works plant of U.S. Steel. A few months after starting the job she graduated with a B.A. in sociology. Working at the plant, she met Charles Tuteur, a German Jew who had fled Nazi Germany and they married that same year. The following year, the young couple moved to Vancouver, Washington, where she became a ship fitter and welder at the Kaiser Shipyards. They tried to enlist together but Charles was rejected due to injuries sustained during a civilian imprisonment by the Nazis before his escape. Manny was accepted into the Women's Army Corps and sent to basic training in Ft. Benning, Georgia, where she then completed parachute school. She returned to Vancouver, working in the shipyard until 1945. When the war ended, the couple returned to Chicago, where Tuteur worked as a caseworker for the Cook County Bureau of Public Welfare, and taught at several preschools hosted by the Jewish Community Center. She earned a master's degree in early childhood education from Chicago State University and applied for a job with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU), which was looking for someone to start a child care program for workers in 1969. It was the first union- sponsored day care program in the United States and was funded by a negotiated percentage of salaries paid to workers by the contribution of clothing manufacturers. The center provided, at no cost to union workers, care for 3 to 6-year-old children, which included free health and dental assessments and twice-weekly meetings with a psychiatric social worker. During her tenure at the ACTWU Child Care Center, Tuteur made several trips abroad to study childcare and labor. In 1977, she visited France, Israel and Sweden with a group sponsored by the German Marshall Fund. The group included Clara Day of the Teamsters Union and the women spent a week in each country evaluating how trade unions dealt with the needs of their female workforce. In 1980, Tuteur and Day made a similar trip to China with a group sponsored by Trade Unions of China. The ACTWU went on to open similar centers in Maryland and Virginia, based on the Chicago model Tuteur directed. She managed the program from its opening until 1983, when it was closed due to economic constrictions. In 1982, Tuteur received the Florence Criley Award, which was presented by the Coalition of Labor Union Women. The following year, Tuteur became the ACTWU's Assistant Director of Education and Political Action and served in that capacity for more than a decade. In 1995, when the ACTWU merged with the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) to form Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE), she became the Assistant Education Director for the Chicago and Central States Board and remained in that position until her 2001 retirement. Tuteur was one of the founding members of the Chicago chapter of the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW) and served as its president from 1978 to 1982. She also served on the National executive board of CLUW and was a long-running co-chair of the organization's National Child Care Task Force. In 1984, she was appointed to serve on an advisory board established by Senator Paul Simon to evaluate the rollbacks in women's rights which occurred under the Reagan administration. Throughout her career, she served on many local, state and national committees and task forces which dealt with women's and family issues, including the Illinois Women‚Äôs Agenda, the National Implementation Task Force for the White House Conference on Families, and Women for Economic Justice. In 1988, she was the recipient of the Hannah G. Solomon Award from the National Council of Jewish Women and the following year was inducted into the Chicago Women's Hall of Fame. After she retired, Tuteur moved to California but continued to be active, registering voters, participating in demonstrations and serving as an officer of the National Council of Jewish Women. Death and legacy Tuteur died on February 3, 2016 at the Saddleback Memorial Hospital of Laguna Hills and was buried on 17 March 2016 at the Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California. Her papers, containing information on women's and labor rights, were donated to the Walter P. Reuther Library at Wayne State University.

Using oak and the same architect, he added a chancel screen, panelling, a retable and a new altar.West Yorkshire Archive service, Morley: Document RD/AF2/19/26 (1905) Killinghall faculty Elliston \\"was involved in many aspects of village life [and] was responsible for plans to improve and alter the chancel of the church in 1905.\\" His churchwardens were John Hirst and George Lewis. He established the Killinghall parish magazine which ran for many years from 1904. In 1922 the West Riding Education Authority suggested that the village church school and board school should be amalgamated to save ¬£300 per year, but Canon Elliston's objections on the grounds of religion's precedence over economy were respected. By 1937 the issue had been raised again, and the board school became the village hall. However the school continued to require space in the village hall for many years, showing Canon Elliston's objection to be valid for other reasons. In 1915, he was involved in the setting up of a Church Tent for assistance in the nearby encampment of 5,000 soldiers at Penny Pot. In 1916 as a trustee of the Parish Room he was involved in its temporary conversion into a Soldiers' Club for the same men. On Fridays in the 1920s, the village school children were marched into the church for a service, and since headgear was mandatory in church, the girls had to wear knotted handkerchiefs on their heads. Sometimes Elliston would visit the school to teach the catechism.

He also proposed an inscribed brass war memorial tablet within the church, and this was also designed by Wood and unveiled on the same day. In June 1927, Elliston had a spat in The Yorkshire Post with D'Arcy S. Rudd, vicar of St John's church, Leeds, about attendance rates at Sunday schools. Elliston disputed Rudd's figures, and Rudd accused Elliston of complacency.Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer West Yorkshire, England 10 Jun 1927: \\"Sunday schools\\" =Ripon Cathedral= Ripon Cathedral He sat on the 1912 Commission which considered the reorganisation of church finance as recommended by the archbishops.

Editions de Provence) Le Secret du Masque de fer (The Secret of the Iron mask) is a historical essay by French novelist Marcel Pagnol, who identified the famous prisoner in the iron mask as the twin brother of Louis XIV, born after him and imprisoned for life in 1669 for having conspired against the King. The essay was published for the first time in 1965 under the title Le Masque de fer (The Iron Mask), and updated in 1973, completed in particular with research on James de la Cloche, identified as the twin bearing this name in his youth. Raised by the midwife Lady Perronette, the twin was taken to the island of Jersey at the age of six, where he was brought up by Marguerite Carteret, daughter of the island's noblest family. Having converted to Catholicism in 1667, he entered the Jesuit novitiate in Rome in April 1668. He then returned to London at the end of 1668 where he is thought to have conspired against Louis XIV alongside a certain Roux de Marcilly, who was denounced and executed in June 1669. The accomplice of Roux, passing for his valet, Martin, and whom Marcel Pagnol in turn identified as the twin brother of Louis XIV, was also arrested and taken to Calais in July 1669, then brought to Pignerol prison under the custody of the governor Saint-Mars, where he remained until 1681. He was given the name of \\"Eustache Dauger\\", designating him as a simple valet. Still under the custody of Saint Mars, he was transferred to the fort of Exilles then to the island of Sainte-Marguerite in 1687, and finally to the Bastille in 1698, where he died in 1703 after 34 years in captivity. Marcel Pagnol also provides information intended to demonstrate that the prisoner cannot be identified as a valet or as Count Matthioli. He thus contradicts other historians' theories which, in his view, resulted from false information deliberately disseminated by the authorities of the period who, foreseeing later examination of the correspondence, supposedly laid false trails to try to conceal the prisoner's real identity.

Eustache Dauger de Cavoye - Brother of Louis Oger de Cavoye, Chief Marshall of Lodgings of King Louis XIV. He was interned around 1668 and is thought to have died in detention in 1679.  Birth  When Cardinal Richelieu was informed by Louis XIII of the Queen's twin pregnancy, he claimed that the second birth would have to be hidden, as the coexistence of two dauphins would inevitably lead to civil war. The King and the cardinal thus planned the birth to ensure that the Queen's bedroom would be \\"evacuated\\" after the first birth. According to custom, the main figures of the Court attended the birth of the first child, who was quickly baptized, then the King took the Court to the Chapel of the Ch√¢teau de Saint- Germain-en-Laye, where a Te Deum was sung in front of about forty people. However, according to Marcel Pagnol, the Te Deum was normally celebrated in a cathedral, in front of a thousand people from all social classes. Meanwhile, the Queen gave birth to the second child, whom the midwife Lady Perronette immediately hid in her bedroom before taking him to the countryside where she would bring him up as the illegitimate child of a daughter of the nobility.  James de La Cloche  Concerning the prisoner's past, specifically his early years prior to his arrest, Marcel Pagnol identifies the masked prisoner as a certain James de la Cloche, mentioned by some historians, including Lord Acton,In 1862, the historian Lord Acton merged his monthly publications under the title Home and Foreign Review Andrew Lang, Miss Carey,Pagnol refers to The Channel Islands (London, 1904) by Miss Carey, a study of the History of the Channel Islands.] Mgr BarnesIn his book The Man Behind the Mask, Mgr Barnes asserts that James was really the illegitimate child of Charles II. and Emile Laloy. = Growing up on the Island of Jersey = In 1644, when Queen Henrietta of France, sister of Louis XIII, is about to give birth to Henrietta of England, the midwife Lady Perronette was sent to England by Cardinal Mazarin to assist, taking the twin with her in order to hide him abroad, which was the actual purpose of her journey. After giving birth, Henrietta of France sent Lady Perronette to the Carteret's, the noblest family on the Jersey island,A little coastal area in Cotentin still bears this name today, the commune of Barneville-Carteret. so their daughter Marguerite could raise the child, being introduced as the son of a young noblewoman. It is to the same Carteret family that Henrietta of England sent her son (the future Charles II) during the civil war in 1646. In 1657 Marguerite married Jean de la Cloche who gave his name to James.The origin of the name \\"de la Cloche\\" is then established, but not of the first name James, the English equivalent of Jacobus. The English sounding name suggests that this first name was given after the arrival on the Island of Jersey, which was French-speaking. Later, finding a striking resemblance between himself and Charles II when seeing his portrait,Pagnol sees in it a striking resemblance between Charles II and Louis XIV (first cousins), referring to a portrait of Charles II painted by Peter Lely, offered to Sir Carteret by Henrietta of England. he was convinced of being the King's son and wished to be legally recognised, like two other illegitimate sons who hence got the dukedom.Pagnol cites the Duke of Monmouth, son of Lucy Walter, who obtained this title in 1663. He also mentions the Duke of Saint-Albans, son of Nell Gwyn, but he was only made a duke in 1684, whereas \\"Dauger\\" had already been imprisoned for fifteen years. Marguerite (or probably her father Sir Carteret) approached the King on his behalf, but the latter did not acknowledge him. = Jesuit in Rome = Afterwards, James did not give up just yet. Knowing via the Carteret family that Charles II was secretly preparing for his conversion to Catholicism,Charles's true intentions regarding his conversion to Catholicism remain unknown: he secretly commits to this later, in one of the clauses of the Treaty of Dover, and only converts on his deathbed in 1685. It is known, however, that his mother Henrietta of France and his wife Catherine of Braganza were catholic. he decided to become a Catholic priest in order to be able to convert Charles II. In 1667,Pagnol does not give any precise date as to when James approached King Charles II, doubtless through the Carterets. James Scott, illegitimate son of Charles II, was made Duke of Monmouth in 1663. If, further to Charles II's refusal to acknowledge him, he converted to Catholicism in 1667 (aiming to convert Charles II afterwards), it would have been a late reaction, a couple of years after James Scott obtained the title of duke. he went to Hamburg to convert to Catholicism,Pagnol does not specify James de la Cloche's religion before conversion to Catholicism. According to Lord Acton, who obtained a copy of a manuscript from the archives of the Jesuits in Rome, James is thought to have been raised in the Protestant religion. then appeared on 11 April 1668 at the Institute of Jesuit novices in Rome to take his novitiate under the supervision of Father Abbot Oliva. He supported his application with two certificates acknowledging him as \\"Prince Stuart\\", King Charles II's son: one from Charles II himself and the other from Queen Christina of Sweden. Other letters from Charles II arrived at the Institute:Pagnol obtained photostats of Charles II's letters through the archivist Father at the Church of the Ges√π in Rome Shortly after James's arrival, Father Olivia thus learned that the King was preparing to convert to Catholicism, and that he could only count on his son to convert him as soon as he was ordained as a priest. Charles II promised the throne to James and a generous reward to the Jesuits. Then, when the upcoming visit of Christina of Sweden to Rome was announced, Father Oliva received a letter from Charles II in which he asked him not to mention James as being his son to the Queen and called James to London in great urgency. James then went off to London. Just before James‚Äô departure, which Marcel Pagnol places in early December 1668, Father Oliva received from Charles II a debt of gratitude. In a Post-scriptum, the latter asked for a payment to James of 800 pounds that he undertook to reimburse to him.The sum of 800 pounds sterling is mentioned as having already been paid to James, which Pagnol interprets as an express request, representing a case of swindling. According to Marcel Pagnol, Oliva certainly paid that sum to James, believing the authenticity of the letters and royal guarantees. Comparing the letters from Charles II to Father Oliva with other letters addressed to his sister Henrietta of England,Pagnol obtained the letters of Charles II to his sister through the Foreign Affairs archives. These were used by experts in graphology consulted by Pagnol to examine the writing and compare it against the letters addressed to Father Oliva in Rome. Regarding the King's secret conversion, the letters to Father Oliva were certainly not dictated to a secretary. two graphologist experts consulted by Pagnol are positive: the letters sent to Father Oliva are fake, making James a fraud.The historian John Lingard, who procured the letters of Charles II to James and Father Oliva, affirmed that they all are fakes, making James an imposter prince. The letters addressed to King Charles II evoke Queen Henrietta Maria as being in London in 1668, when she went to settle in France three years before, where she remained until her death in 1669. ,Pagnol then cited another evidence put forward by John Lingard identifying one of the letters as a fake: \\"On the other hand, one of the King's certificates is dated from White Hall while the King, because of the plague in London, had taken refuge in Oxford with all his court\\". Indeed, the letter of November 18, 1668 by which Charles II sent a debt of gratitude to Father Oliva, is dated from Whitehall. However, according to the article Charles II of England referring to the book Charles II by John Miller, the royal family left London in July 1665 for Salisbury, while Parliament met in Oxford. The King returned to London in February 1666, he could therefore have drafted a letter to White Hall in late 1668. Marcel Pagnol's believed in James‚Äô good faith though, admitting that he sincerely believed he was the bastard son of Charles II.By placing James's birth at the time of Louis XIV's, i.e. 5 September 1638, he would only be eight years younger than Charles II, born in 1630. = Meeting Charles II = Still proceeding with the trick of a fake supporting letter from Charles II, James would have requested an audience with Henrietta of England. In light of other correspondence between Charles II and Henrietta of England, Marcel Pagnol establishes that Henrietta received James, and handed him a letter for the attention of Charles II, judiciously leaving to him the responsibility of ordaining James. When James gave the letter to Charles II in London in early 1669, the latter recognised him and revealed the secret of his birth, which he certainly inherited from his mother Henrietta of France.Queen Henrietta of France is thought to have revealed the secret to her son Charles II at the time of her coronation in 1649, after James and Charles II were together on the island of Jersey for around two years, between 1646 and 1648. Pagnol does not mention any encounter between James and Charles II between 1649 and the beginning of 1669 Learning that he should be in reign instead of his twin brother, James is sent by Charles II to Roux de Marcilly who is leading a conspiracy against Louis XIV.  Roux de Marcilly's conspiracy (1668-1669)  In 1668, Roux de Marcilly was the head and coordinator of a plot against King of France Louis XIV. In a socio- political context of persecution of Huguenots and famine, the plot was on a European scale. The conspiracy aimed at overturning Louis XIV's government and change into republic provinces like Provence, Dauphin√© and Languedoc, with the military support of Switzerland, Spain and United Netherlands (Dutch Republic). Based in London, Roux was betrayed, denounced in May 1668, illegally kidnapped in Switzerland and jailed, and then condemned to deathThe sentence against Roux de Marcilly is given in a bibliographical note available in the Archives of the French National Library (reference number N¬∞ FRBNF36755131). by \\"breaking on the wheel\\" in Paris on 21 June 1669. Marcel Pagnol recreated, through various correspondences and his own interpretation of them, the chronology of the arrest of the accomplice who would later be known as the famous Man in the Iron Mask. He was said to be made out to be Martin, Roux de Marcilly's valet, in order to hide his true identity. = Denunciation and condemnation = In London, at the start of May 1668, Sir Samuel Morland, a diplomat and ancient member of the Parliament, earned the trust of Roux de Marcilly. Morland denounced the conspirator to Henri de Massue de Rouvigny, the ambassador extraordinary of France in London. Skeptical at first, Rouvigny soon decided to arrange a dinner in the honour of Roux, aiming to hear his plans: During this dinner, Morland asked Roux a series of questions prepared in advance by de Rouvigny who, hidden in a cabinet, wrote down all the answers. Straight after, de Rouvigny sent a long letter to King Louis XIV, giving all the details to denounce Roux, his accomplices, contacts and current moves.Mr de Ruvigny even goes as far as to warn of a possible attack against Louis XIV when he writes, describing Roux, that \\"this devil incarnate says that a well-supported coup will bring relief to everyone.\\" In his essay, Marcel Pagnol reproduced in extenso the letter from the ambassador de Rouvigny to Louis XIV, which denounced the conspirator and his accomplices. This letter was found in the archives of the Ministry of Affaires √©trang√®res (Foreign Affairs). However, this letter provided little information on the identity of Roux de Marcilly and his occupations in London, only briefly referring to a military past.The ambassador Mr de Ruvigny writes to Louis XIV that the conspirator Roux de Marcilly \\"is a Huguenot, and a native of four or five leagues from Nimes, he has a house, [‚Ä¶] six leagues from Orl√©ans, named Marcilly, he says he served in Catalonia, [‚Ä¶], that he served the people of the Piedmont valleys, [‚Ä¶]\\" de Rouvigny denounced an accomplice called Balthazar based in Geneva, and also named the Marquis of Castelo Rodrigo in Spain, King of England Charles II (first cousin of Louis XIV) and his brother the Duke of York as being well aware of the plot and linked with Roux.According to the report by Mr de Ruvigny, deputy Ambassador of France in London, denouncing Roux de Marcilly's conspiracy, it had been \\"agreed that the King of England would have Guyenne, Poitou, Brittany and Normandy, [‚Ä¶].\\" Roux is thought to have referred to a conversation with the Duke of York and an appointment with Arlington. In spite of his long meetings with the Duke of York and State Secretary Md Arlington, Roux said he was disappointed by the lack of cooperation of England, reluctant to launch the first attacks on France. On the other hand, Roux was much more confident about the massive support of Spain and Switzerland. Marcel Pagnol reckons that Roux's plan had very good chances of success, because of the socio-political context of persecution of Protestants and famine. After Rouvigny's report, Roux, who had been warned of the danger, fled to Switzerland where he took refuge with his friend Balthazar at the end of February 1669. In defiance of the Swiss sovereignty,After Roux was abducted on their territory, Swiss people protested and demanded the prisoner to be returned. French historian Haag wrote in La France protestante: \\"Outraged by the violation of their territory, Swiss people put the French emissaries on trial and had them sentenced to death by contumacy.\\" Louis XIV had him kidnapped. On 19 May 1669 (almost one year after the letter that denounced him), Roux was made prisoner and sent to the Bastille, where the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mgr de Lionne questions him under torture. Louis XIV had his trial sped up to only 2 days: Roux de Marcilly was executed by \\"breaking on the wheel\\" in public in Paris on 21 June 1669. Roux was said to have been gagged for his execution.Pagnol quotes the testimony of French magistrate Olivier Lef√®vre d‚ÄôOrmesson. = The valet Martin = Active research went on in the days following the execution of Roux de Marcilly, much likely to further avowals and revelations he gave away while being tortured. On 12 June 1669, while the plot was already known and everything was in place for the condemnation of Roux, Lionne informed Colbert that a certain \\"Martin\\", Roux's valet, was very urgently sought in France by the King. In a letter of 1 July 1669, Colbert, who had not managed to persuade Martin to go to Paris, proposed to Lionne \\"to write to the King of England and ask him to have this man [a certain accomplice named Veyras]Shortly after, on 13 July, Lionne informs Colbert de Croissy that it is no longer necessary to arrest the accomplice Veyras : \\"For Veyras, God will take care of his punishment.\\" and [‚Ä¶] Martin, Roux's valet, arrested and taken to Calais\\", which King Charles II could not refuse as Roux was acting from London.In early June 1669, i.e. at the time of de Marcilly's trial, Charles II summoned the ambassador Colbert de Croissy to express to Louis XIV his regrets for not having had, in his own words, \\"the slightest knowledge of the pernicious intentions of this villain [Roux]\\" on the lands of his kingdom. Following this letter from Colbert, Charles II wrote a letter to his sister Henrietta of England which he did not entrust to his ordinary couriersOn 5 July, Charles II writes to his sister Henrietta of England: \\"I will write you another letter tomorrow [on 6 July] that I will entrust to Abbot Pregnani.\\" and which disappeared in suspicious circumstances (See section \\"Those who died because of it\\"). According to Marcel Pagnol, it was with this letter that King Charles II asked his sister Henriette to announce to Louis XIV the arrest of the \\"valet Martin\\", who was later taken to Calais as suggested by the ambassador Colbert de Croissy. Yet on 13 July, Lionne informed Croissy that \\"after Roux's execution it is no longer necessary to bring Martin to France\\". According to Marcel Pagnol, this U-turn from the minister, occurring 22 days after Roux's execution, means in reality that Martin was arrested and lends weight to the theory that the King's order to kidnap Martin was entrusted to a special official, without the ambassador's knowledge. Marcel Pagnol therefore places the arrival of \\"Martin\\" (arrested in England) in Calais between 6 and 12 July 1669.After the arrest of \\"Martin Dauger\\", Lionne publicly declared that \\"it would have been better not to arrest Roux, as we had absolutely no proof of the existence of a conspiracy, [‚Ä¶].\\"Pagnol considers this declaration to be ridiculous and intended to downplay the matter: \\"there was no conspiracy and consequently no accomplice.\\" Marcel Pagnol also indicates the existence of a real valet named Martin who served Roux: he was found in London when Roux was tracked down and said he did not know anything about the plot led by his former master. Marcel Pagnol concludes the first part of his investigation with the theory that \\"Roux [‚Ä¶] admitted under torture that the leader of the plot was the twin brother of Louis XIV, who should have reigned instead of him, and that this prince, thus deprived of his rights, pretended to be his valet Martin.\\" = Charles II = Apparently, according to the examination of de Rouvigny's letter, it is clear that the role of King Charles II of England in this conspiracy went further than only hiding it from his cousin. He is even said to have given two audiences to Roux de Marcilly, and some French provinces were promised to England after the fall of Louis XIV 308. However, what was also revealed in this letter was that Roux regretted the lack of cooperation of England, and was reluctant to launch the first attacks on France. Marcel Pagnol explained this by the fact that a high amount of money was secretly given to Charles II by Louis XIV. Charles II might have followed the \\"wait and see\\" tactic, and waited for Spain and Switzerland to start the hostilities before launching the battle with a more favorable situation. Attacked on several fronts, French forces would have probably been defeated. Marcel Pagnol reckons that Charles II is the one who arranged contact between the twin and the conspirator Roux: Charles II is supposed to have met the twin in early 1669 (cf previous chapter). This is how Marcel Pagnol believes James was told his true identity, and was sent to Roux who was plotting a massive conspiracy against Louis XIV,This timeline given by Pagnol appears quite questionable since in 1669, Roux had already been denounced for several months. as all Charles II's government was well aware. = \\"The valet Martin\\" becomes \\"Eustache Dauger\\" = In a letter dated 26 July 1669, the minister Louvois gives the order to Captain de Vauroy, Major of the citadel of Dunkirk, to take a certain \\"Eustache Dauger\\" to the prison of Pignerol. Marcel Pagnol identifies this prisoner as the accomplice of Roux previously named \\"Martin\\", and later to be the famous prisoner in the iron mask. This is clearly a false name in order to conceal the real identity of the prisoner. Indeed, a real Eustache Dauger actually existed, as Martin, Roux de Marcilly's valet. Following the letter from Louvois which De Vauroy received on 3 August, the prisoner Dauger arrived in Pignerol on 24 August, escorted by De Vauroy. Marcel Pagnol wonders about this delay of over twenty days, due either to the health of the prisoner, overwhelmed by his arrest, or to interrogations taking place.It is not known where exactly the prisoner is located when Mr de Vauroy receives Louvois's letter on 3RD August. Immediately after his arrival in Calais, he was certainly interned in the vicinity of Dunkirk. He may also have been questioned in Paris before the transfer to Pignerol. In August 1670, Louvois completed the route from Paris (or Versailles) to Brian√ßon in just five days on his way to Pignerol. Marcel Pagnol then produces the hypothesis that the King, through Louvois, proposed a deal to the prisoner: \\"the King would spare his life, provided that he solemnly undertook to remain silent forever; but in the interest of the State, His Majesty was obliged to deprive him of his freedom.\\" Marcel Pagnol feels, however, that any direct meeting with Louis XIV was \\"very improbable\\".  Eustache Dauger  Marcel Pagnol lists 13 \\"conditions\\" concerning the prisoner \\"Eustache Dauger\\" and enabling a correspondence to be established with the information on James de la Cloche at his disposal. = Eustache Dauger de Cavoye = Eustache Dauger de Cavoye was the brother of Louis Oger de Cavoye, who was King Louis XIV's Chief Marshall of Lodgings in 1677. Following incidents of misconduct (including the manslaughter of a 15-year-old pageboy) he was expelled from the army then interned in St-Lazare at his brother's Louis request. In a letter dated 23 January 1678 in which he implores his sister to help him, he says he has been \\"detained for more than ten years\\" and he is dying.This letter written by the real Eustache Dauger de Cavoye, imprisoned when he wrote it on 23 January 1678, was found in the family archives of Germaine de Sarret, whose grandfather had married Louis and Eustache's sister. Pagnol quotes Andr√© Ch√©ron and Germaine de Sarret's book. Eustache Dauger de Cavoye claims to be dying when he describes himself as a \\"poor man leading a languishing life that is soon to end [‚Ä¶].\\" Marcel Pagnol deduces that in July 1669 King Louis XIV and Louvois, knowing that Eustache Dauger de Cavoye had been interned for approximately one year, gave his name (truncating it) to the man arrested and taken to Calais, who was the prisoner in the iron mask. Marcel Pagnol states that Eustache Dauger de Cavoye died in detention in 1679, without however quoting any document proving this. = Transfer to Pignerol = Saint-Mars, prison governor in Pignerol In the documents at Marcel Pagnol's disposal, the name Eustache Dauger appears for the first time in the letter from Louvois dated 19 July 1669 (i.e. the day after the arrest of the valet Martin) announcing to governor Saint-Mars the due arrival of the prisoner in Pignerol and stipulating that \\"he is only a valet\\".Louvois' letter dated 19 July 1669, which informs Saint-Mars of the prisoner's arrival in Pignerol, was found in 1829 by French historian Joseph Delort at the National Archives. After ¬´ Martin ¬ª the true identity of the prisoner was hidden under another name, but he was still referred to as a valet. The real Eustache Dauger, however, cannot be referred to as a valet. Then, in his letter of 26 July 1669, Louvois orders Captain De Vauroy, Major of the citadel of Dunkirk, to take the prisoner Dauger to Pignerol. The content of the letters (and the explanatory ¬´ loose sheets ¬ª which would have accompanied it, which was a common practice at that time) suggests that Louvois also ordered Vauroy not to inform his military superior, the Count of Estrades, of the purpose of his mission, under the false pretext of the deportation of Spanish deserters. The minister Louvois himself contacted Estrades, asking him to dismiss Vauroy without specifying the nature of the \\"affairs\\" in question. However, the Count of Estrades, who at the time was in charge of the most important maritime stronghold in the kingdom in his capacity as Governor of Dunkirk, and whom the King and Louvois fully trusted, would most certainly have been informed of Vauroy's mission had it only concerned a simple valet. Following the death in 1674 of Champagne, one of Nicolas Fouquet's two valets, Dauger was officially made Fouquet's valet. Then following the death of Fouquet in 1680, Louvois ordered the imprisonment of Dauger and La Rivi√®re, while announcing their release. When the masked prisoner arrived at the Bastille, \\"Eustache Dauger\\" was therefore officially released. Du Junca, \\"the King's lieutenant\\" of the Bastille, noted on the evening of 18 September 1698 the arrival of \\"a former prisoner whom he [Saint-Mars] had in Pignerol, whom he always kept masked and whose name cannot be spoken [‚Ä¶]\\".Marcel Pagnol concludes that after the announcement of \\"Dauger's\\" release, Saint-Mars did not use any false name or pseudonym.However, Mr du Palteau writes to Mr du Fr√©ron in June 1768: \\"The man in the iron mask [‚Ä¶] was only ever referred to on the Islands of Sainte- Marguerite and at the Bastille under the name of la Tour.\\" This name can be found in a letter from Louvois to Saint-Mars at the time of the transfer to Sainte-Marguerite: \\"two prisoners in the lower tower (la tour d‚Äôen bas)\\" = Correspondence = Marcel Pagnol bases his argument on what he found in the correspondence between Saint-Mars and the Minister of War under Louis XIV -- this being Louvois until 1691, then his son Barbezieux from July 1669 (date of the imprisonment in Pignerol) to 1698 (date of the transfer to Sainte- Marguerite). It seems that Saint-Mars sent a weekly report on the state prison to the minister, who systematically replied with his instructions. Among this extensive correspondence, Pagnol mainly has at his disposal the minister's replies, collected by the Deposit Office of War and National Archives. However, Saint-Mars's letters sent to Paris (or Versailles) appear to have been significantly expurgated. Pagnol's theory is based on the interpretation he makes of this correspondence in which he perceives lies jointly devised between the minister and Saint-Mars, so as to develop, having foreseen the possible loss of the letters or their later examination, an \\"official version\\" regarding the prisoner's identity, rather than systematically destroying the documents which would have doubtless aroused more suspicion and curiosity. The official version of the \\"valet\\" Eustache Dauger is maintained in the correspondence until the false announcement of the release of the prisoner \\"Eustache Dauger\\". Then in 1679 Louvois is thought  Conditions and cost of detention  The prisoner spent 34 years in captivity in four different prisons (Pignerol, Exilles, the island of Sainte-Marguerite, then the Bastille), in the custody of the same general staff, being Saint-Mars and his lieutenants. Even the turnkey (Antoine R√ª) was with him throughout his captivity. The financial question is one of the main elements raised by Marcel Pagnol demonstrating, in his view, the importance of the masked prisoner, and thus refuting the theories which identify this prisoner as a simple valet: Marcel Pagnol estimated the cost of 34 years of captivity at at least 5 billion Francs,To convert livres into francs, Pagnol uses the value of 3000 francs (1960) for the livre tournois, the ‚Äòlivre parisis‚Äô having been abolished in 1667.,Pagnol refers to Saint-Mars's inheritance as estimated at around 5 billion: 3 seigniorial estates: Le Palteau, Erimont, Dixmont. Iung estimates their value at 10 million francs in 1873, i.e. over 4 billion francs in 1960; 600 million in cash, silverware, furniture, weapons and jewellery. bearing in mind that he estimated those of Fouquet (16 years) and Lauzun (10 years) at 1 billion. Marcel Pagnol thus underlines the \\"considerations\\" shown to the prisoner, indicating his importance: three cells built especially for him, a very generous allowance, a certain level of luxury and exceptional treatment, including for example the permanent provision of a doctor. He was apparently granted all that he asked for. = Pignerol = Pignerol is a small town located on the slopes of the Alps, in what is now Piedmont. It was known above all for its citadel and keep, all surrounded by significant fortifications, forming a powerful fortress from where a French attack could very easily penetrate into Italy. The keep was a state prison, attached to the ministry of War, almost as famous as the Bastille, but with an even more frightening reputation. When Lauzun learned that the King had ordered his imprisonment in Pignerol, he tried to commit suicide. The prison housed the free company of Saint-Mars, composed of 66 soldiers and a number of officers, but there were just five or six cells in the keep, where only state prisoners were held. Saint-Mars's lieutenants were Guillaume de Formanoir (his nephew) and Blainvilliers (his first cousin). Louis de Formanoir, his second nephew, served in the cadets of the free company. De Rosarges was the ‚ÄòMajor‚Äô of the prison, the governor's assistant, and the turnkey was Antoine R√ª. There were also professional valets in the prison. The prisoners in Pignerol in the custody of Saint-Mars were: Fouquet (1664), ¬´ Eustache Dauger ¬ª (1669), Lauzun (1671), A Jacobin monk (1674), Dubreuil (1676), Count Matthioli (1679). \\"He is only a valet\\" In his letter to Saint-Mars on 19 July 1669 announcing the arrival of \\"Dauger\\" in Pignerol, Louvois set out instructions regarding the conditions of detention and treatment assigned to him. With reference to the furniture to be provided, he states that \\"he is only a valet\\". Marcel Pagnol regards this statement as contradictory to the content of the letter and the instructions indicative of such an important personality: * The detention of this prisoner was a secret and was not to be revealed to anyone. Saint-Mars was to threaten him with death should he speak of \\"anything other than his immediate needs\\". * The minister asked for the construction of a real strong room (not an underground dungeon) even though some cells were available in Pignerol. For this purpose he commissioned Poupart, colonel of the Engineers and a close assistant of Vauban. * He ordered Saint-Mars to purchase furniture, whereas, according to Marcel Pagnol, he already had plenty to furnish the cell of a simple valet. * Louvois suggested that, in terms of cost, the captive did not fall into the meal category of a soldier or an officer, but that he would refund \\"anything you [Saint-Mars] wish\\", and asked Saint-Mars to bring his meals to him himself. Marcel Pagnol concludes the analysis of Louvois's letter by underlining that if a valet had known a dangerous secret, the danger he represented would not have been prolonged for thirty-four years by granting him such expensive detention conditions. He also compared some of the detention conditions with those of other prisoners such as Fouquet, Lauzun and Matthioli, who had not benefited from the construction of a new cell. Furthermore, the detention of prisoners such as Fouquet or Lauzun did not remain secret for such a long time. American writer Julian Hawthorne also supports the identification of the Man in the iron Mask with this valet, whom he does not liken to Louis XIV's twin brother though. Fouquet's \\"valet\\" At the beginning of 1675, in response to Saint-Mars's repeated requests offering the prisoner \\"Dauger\\" as a valet for Lauzun then for Fouquet, Louvois authorised him to place Dauger in the service of Fouquet (who already benefited from the services of the valet La Rivi√®re), but strictly forbade him from giving the prisoner to Lauzun. Dauger then officially became Fouquet's valet, which supported the official claim that \\"he is only a valet\\". Louvois also continued to express his deep concern and warned Saint-Mars again regarding any encounter between Dauger and Lauzun, when Fouquet was allowed to meet Lauzun at the beginning of 1679.Fouquet and Lauzun would communicate secretly through a hole dug between their cells. Saint-Mars reported it to Louvois further to Fouquet's death. According to Marcel Pagnol, Saint-Mars would actually have felt sorry for the prisoner confined in his loneliness and whose health was deteriorating. Despite Louvois's order to threaten him with death if he tried to speak to him, Saint- Mars is assumed to have listened to his story and trusted him to remain silent towards Fouquet When Dauger becomes Fouquet's valet (this is the official version at least, but he was allowed to meet him in any case), he does not sleep in his bedroom and during the day their conversations are always monitored by an officer (or by Saint-Mars himself). The fact remains that Dauger is therefore thought not to have kept his promise because he would, according to Pagnol, have revealed to Louvois that he knew Dauger's secret (i.e. his real identity), the reason why Louis XIV and Louvois prepared his \\"execution\\" . Marcel Pagnol goes as far as to propose that it was the prisoner himself who suggested to Saint-Mars that he adopt this approach towards Louvois. Then, following Fouquet's death in 1680, Louvois ordered Saint-Mars to confine Dauger and La Rivi√®re, depriving them of communication with anyone at all, while announcing their release, notably to Lauzun. This false announcement of Dauger's release supported the idea that \\"he is only a valet\\" in so far as he would be released the day after his master's death. It was at this point, according to Marcel Pagnol, that La Rivi√®re became the valet of \\"Dauger\\". Seeing himself thus condemned to life imprisonment alongside \\"Dauger\\" without any form of accusation or judgment, he died in Exilles on 4 January 1687. Prisoner's health For the rest of his life the prisoner had a doctor at his disposal: Louvois authorized Saint-Mars to call one if needed without prior authorisation. During the first month of captivity, correspondence between Louvois and Saint-Mars testifies to the continuous and scrupulous monitoring of the prisoner's health (he was seriously ill in September 1669), reminding Marcel Pagnol of an old saying according to which \\"when a twin is sick, it does not take long for the other to perish\\". Furthermore, Marcel Pagnol sets out an analogy between the health status of \\"Dauger\\" and Louis XIV, involving feverishness and various chronic illnesses. He bases this on reports from Saint-Mars to LouvoisSaint-Mars writes to Louvois : \\"As there is always some one of my two prisoners sick, [‚Ä¶]\\" (Exilles, 4 December 1681) \\"My prisoner, valetudinarian as always [‚Ä¶]\\" (letter quoted by Iung) on the one hand, and extracts from Henri Druon's \\"L‚ÄôEducation des Princes\\" on the other. = Exilles = In 1681, following the death of the Duke de Lesdigui√®res, governor of Exilles, Louis XIV reassigned the position to Saint-Mars, who had expressed in a letter to Louvois his \\"extreme repugnance [with] commanding the citadel of Pignerol\\". Thus, in October 1681, Saint-Mars, his prisoners and his company of 45 men left Pignerol for Exilles. Fort of Exilles Marcel Pagnol quotes correspondence concerning the transfer to Exilles between Louvois and Saint-Mars as well as Du Chaunoy, then war administrator in charge of army supplies and buildings. In his letters Louvois explicitly transmitted the order of His Majesty to transfer two prisoners from Pignerol described as \\"quite important\\" with Saint-Mars, without mentioning their names and calling them the \\"two prisoners from the lower tower\\".On 12 May 1681, Louvois writes to Saint-Mars: \\"Regarding the two [prisoners] in the lower tower, you only have to mark them down with this name, without putting anything else.\\" Saint-Mars scrupulously applies these instructions when he writes to the Abbot of Estrades, at the time of the transfer to Exilles on 25 June 1681: \\"I will have custody of two wretches that I have here [in Pignerol], who have no other name than ‚Äòthe men in the lower tower‚Äô (Messieurs de la tour d‚Äôen bas).\\" This characterisation of \\"the lower tower\\" can be found in the name \\"La Tour\\" in the account of Mr du Palteau. Marcel Pagnol positively identifies these two prisoners as \\"Dauger\\" and the valet La Rivi√®re, despite the announcement of their release the day after Fouquet's death. Saint-Mars only took two prisoners with him, Dauger and La Rivi√®re. Matthioli and the others stayed in Pignerol. Marcel Pagnol also notes, in the correspondence between Louvois (later Barbezieux) and Saint-Mars, what he calls a \\"machination\\" in the form of a double red herring regarding the prisoner's identity: On the one hand, the official version that \\"he is only a valet\\", as when derisory expenses are mentioned;On 14 December 1681, Louvois ordered Saint-Mars to dress the two prisoners (Dauger and La Rivi√®re) in new clothes, specifying that \\"the clothes must last three or four years for these sorts of people,\\" speaking of Dauger and the valet La Rivi√®re with the same contempt. Pagnol feels that the saving made on an outfit supposed to last four years is derisory considering that the allowance for the two prisoners was 35,000 francs per day, and that their arrival in Pignerol cost 9 million francs‚Äô worth of work for each of them. On the other hand, false information about a transfer of Matthioli with Saint-Mars to Exilles,In his letter of 9 June 1681, Louvois orders Saint-Mars to leave for Exilles. At the end of his letter, he adds that Matthioli's \\"rags\\" [‚Ä¶] \\"must be brought to Exilles,\\" suggesting that Matthioli is among the prisoners to be transferred to Exilles. However the Italian stayed for more than ten years in Pignerol, as proven by the letter from Saint-Mars to the Abbot of Estrades (who therefore escapes the purge of the War Ministry) of 25th June: \\"Matthioli will stay here [in Pignerol].\\" which fuelled the widespread theory taking Matthioli to be the prisoner who would later be masked in Sainte-Marguerite then at the Bastille. Marcel Pagnol returns again to the financial question, in particular the resources used to transfer \\"Dauger\\" and the valet La Rivi√®re and their conditions of detention in Pignerol, the whole matter being guarded with state secrecy: * The transfer to Exilles took place by night, in a clandestine manner, in so far as Saint-Mars did not inform Governor D‚ÄôHarleville of it. The prisoners were transported in a litter. * The fort of Exilles was not a prison. Therefore, \\"Dauger\\" and La Rivi√®re did not appear on any prison register. * The cell especially built in Pignerol for the prisoner \\"Dauger\\" was reproduced in Exilles, at a cost of 18 million Francs.In his letter of 11 May 1681 to the War Administrator du Chaunoy, Louvois mentions \\"some repairs [‚Ä¶] to be done\\" in Exilles related to Saint-Mars and the transfer of his two prisoners. For these \\"repairs\\" Saint-Mars will receive 6000 livres (Iung), i.e. 18 million francs. * The monthly allowance of the prisoner and his valet amounted to 360 livres,According to Iung (Vol. 1244), Saint-Mars received in Exilles, for the two prisoners, 2190 livres per year each, or a total amount of 12 livres (over 35,000 Francs) per day. The same amount was allocated to Saint-Mars \\"for the subsistence of thirty men\\" on 10 February 1672 (National Archives, 120). which at the time corresponded to 7 oxen or 1400 chickens. Furthermore, Saint-Mars benefited from an additional credit for the prisoner, details of which he does not provide. = Sainte-Marguerite = In January 1687, Louis XIV granted the governance of the L√©rins Islands to Saint-Mars, the latter having complained about the toughness of the mountain climate and having reportedly fallen ill. Thus on 17 April Saint-Mars, accompanied by his free company and by \\"Dauger\\", his sole prisoner following the recent death of La Rivi√®re, left Exilles for Sainte-Marguerite, where he arrived on 30 April. √éle Sainte-Marguerite The prisoners on Sainte-Marguerite Island in the custody of Saint-Mars were \\"Dauger\\", a knight from Ch√©zut, five or six Protestant ministers, and later Matthioli (1694). Quoting other correspondence between Louvois and Saint-Mars, Marcel Pagnol again notes the considerable cost of the transfer and the conditions of detention, reproducing the conditions of Exilles: * The prisoner was transferred from Exilles to the Islands in an oilcloth litter, within which he was protected from inquisitive looks, with eight Italian carriers being brought in from Turin. Non-French-speaking Italian carriers were chosen to prevent any communication with the prisoner during the transfer; * Saint-Mars once again had a cell Pagnol gives the measurements of the dungeon of Sainte-Marguerite, estimating its cost of construction, in addition to the cost of Saint-Mars's accommodation, at 7200 livres, or 21 million francs: 30 m2, height of ceiling: 4.50 m, window 2.05 m x 1.15 m. built especially for Dauger, whereas the fortress of Sainte- Marguerite was an important prison already containing about ten cells; the correspondence between Louvois and Saint-Mars showed a total credit of 7200 livres, or over 21 million old francs.For the islands‚Äô dungeon, Saint-Mars obtained credit of 5300 livres, extended by a supplement of 1900 livres. (Pagnol quotes a letter from Louvois of 16 March 1687 which indicates an initial amount of 5026 livres.) This total amount of 7200 livres, more than 21 million old francs, did not in fact cover the entire work, if labour is taken into account, which was free at the time as it was provided by engineering companies of the War Commissioner Mr du Chesnoy. The dungeon can still be visited (or at least it could when Pagnol's investigation was republished in 1973). * Saint-Mars came and brought the meals himself to the prisoner, accompanied by two officers, a sergeant and a turnkey, which could not be considered standard procedure in the case of a simple valet.Saint-Mars describes the \\"small ceremony\\" in Barbezieux in his letter of 6 January 1696. He specifies that he made sure the dishes, the corners of the bedroom and other places where the prisoner could have written were scrupulously and systematically inspected. * All the prisoner's linen was changed twice a week, whereas in prisons the bed sheets were changed every three weeks in summer and once a month in winter. A confession by Saint-Mars Marcel Pagnol quotes an invaluable note from Saint-Mars to Louvois on 8 January 1688, in which he refers to a statement of expenses concerning the prisoner, specifying that he was not giving details \\"so that anyone who will see it shall not come to understand anything other than what they already believe.\\" This document shows that: * Saint-Mars was authorized to incur various expenses for this prisoner which were not included in the standard allowance, and which were refunded by the minister; * The people \\"who will see [the report]\\", i.e. Louvois's accountants and secretaries, did not know the prisoner's identity and were supposed to believe in an official version; * Details of the nature of Saint- Mars's expenses would provide revealing information about the prisoner's identity. Marcel Pagnol concludes that Saint-Mars, by thus concealing details which would reveal the importance of the prisoner, betrays the establishment of the official story that \\"he is only a valet\\". = Bastille = In May 1698, minister Barbezieux offered the governance of the Bastille to Saint-Mars for an overall salary, including revenues and profits from prisoners‚Äô food and furnishings, of 40,000 livres per year, i.e. more than 100 million Francs in 1875 (over 40 billion Francs in 1960). After several months of hesitation, Saint-Mars accepted and left the French Riviera for France's first prison. Marcel Pagnol stresses the fact that his team followed him to Paris: Rosarges was promoted to Major of the Bastille, Guillaume de Formanoir administrator of the large prison (he shared his duties with Abbot Giraud) as well as the modest turnkey Antoine R√π, despite the fact that many turnkeys were already employed at the Bastille. The prisoner is thought to have been accommodated in a room close to the governor's apartments.  Fear of an Attack  = Louvois's journey (to Pignerol) = On Saturday 3 August 1670, Louvois went to Pignerol with De Vauban, his assistant Mesgrigny and King's doctor Antoine Vallot. Marcel Pagnol emphasises the urgent nature of this ministerial journey, initially planned for 20 September, moved forward to 15 August, and finally taking place on 8 August (the journey from Paris to Brian√ßon took five days and five nights in a mail-coach) in the delicate European context of the Treaty of Dover. On his return to Paris on 27 August, on the orders of the King Louvois undertook complete renewal of the garrison of Pignerol, involving the replacement of the regiment, the officers (Marcel Pagnol estimates their number to be between 30 and 40) and three governors: La Bretonni√®re, governor of the city, St-Jacques, governor of the Citadel, and the Major of the fort of La P√©rouse. Marcel Pagnol deduces that this journey consisted of a genuine investigation into the socio-political situation in Pignerol, long conversations with the prisoner, as well as a visit to the ambassador of Turin on Sunday 10 August. As for Vauban, his mission consisted of building a strong room for the prisoner, the work only being completed in May of the following year. Marcel Pagnol concludes that Louis XIV discovered important information about Roux de Marcilly's plot in the letters from Charles II to his sister Henrietta: Protestants may have been plotting within the garrison and preparing the prisoner's escape. Louis XIV therefore sent Louvois and Vallot to question the prisoner and undertake complete renewal of the troops on site. = Isolation and Surveillance = From the prisoner's arrival in Pignerol Marcel Pagnol refers to a fortress garrison \\"on the alert\\", due to the fears held by Louvois and Louis XIV of Swiss reprisals, Roux having been arrested in violation of border agreements. Precautions were apparently being taken against an attack by accomplices who might try to release the prisoner, until his transfer to the Bastille: * In Pignerol: Saint-Mars, who had a company of 70 men, was authorised by the King to requisition Mr de Pienne and his garrison,This order from the King on 26 July 1669 constitutes a real disavowal for the Marquis of Pienne, military governor of the citadel and lieutenant general, with regard to the gaoler Saint-Mars, guardian at the commoners‚Äô prison. Mr de Pienne resigned a few months later. i.e. 600 men and their officers. In his letters to Saint-Mars, the minister Louvois insisted on the fact that the prisoner should not speak to anyone; The transfer to Exilles took place by night. The prisoners were transported in a covered litter, surrounded by \\"a whole company of armed men\\". * In Exilles: two men on sentry duty who stood guard day and night had to report any attempt at outside communication.On 11 March 1682, Saint-Mars reports to Louvois the recent settling in of the prisoners in Exilles, particularly the precautions taken to prevent any form of outside communication: Two men on sentry duty who stood guard day and night must report any attempt at outside communication. Also the cell is closed with two doors and a tambour preventing the priest from seeing them from inside the tower; the windows are fitted with triple bars. Pagnol notes the potential methods of messages denounced by Saint-Mars in a letter to Barbezieux, such as \\"rigged\\" candles. According to Pagnol it was due to such messages that the prisoner was transferred to Sainte-Marguerite. * In Sainte- Marguerite: men on sentry duty watched the sea and were ordered to shoot at any boats which came close to the coast. In 1695 Cannes was placed in a state of defence, requesting the Arsenal of Toulon. This threat probably explains the prisoner's transfer to the Bastille. * Transfer to the Bastille: the King did not take action regarding Saint-Mars's request to have \\"safe\\" accommodation on the way to the Bastille. He preferred a more anonymous journey rather than alerting the communities along the various stops. When Saint-Mars and the prisoner stopped off in the locality of Palteau, Saint-Mars had lunch with the prisoner armed with two pistols, which seems excessive if it was only to defend himself from a revolt by the prisoner.  The mask  Throughout his study, Marcel Pagnol refers to the masked prisoner by mentioning \\"the Mask\\". The mask itself is explicitly mentioned in several accounts concerning the detention in Sainte-Marguerite and then at the Bastille. In Pignerol, Marcel Pagnol shows to what extent Louvois feared an encounter with Lauzun who would have doubtless recognized him, suggesting that the prisoner did not wear a mask in Pignerol. In The Age of Louis XIV (1751), Voltaire mentions, during the detention on the island of Sainte-Marguerite, \\"a mask having a chin strap with iron springs, which enabled him to eat with the mask on his face.\\" He also mentions the mask being worn at the Bastille, including during medical examinations. In the account given by Blainvilliers (Saint Mars's lieutenant and cousin), reported by his distant cousin Formanoir du Palteau, a black mask is also mentioned during the transfer from Sainte- Marguerite to the Bastille. Marcel Pagnol finds this black mask in accounts from the Bastille: Lieutenant Du Junca, in his records reporting the arrival of the prisoner at the Bastille, along with a certain prisoner called Linguet, respectively mention \\"a mask of black velvet\\", \\"of velvet and not of iron\\". Thus the iron mask, as depicted in the film The Man in the Iron Mask by Randall Wallace (1998), may only be a legend, a \\"dramatic extension\\" originating from the \\"chin strap with iron springs\\".Count Vermandois and the chin strap with iron springs are again referenced in the legend of an anonymous engraving of 1789: \\"[‚Ä¶] Some papers found at the Bastille inform us that this name [the Man in the Iron Mask] only ever belonged to Louis de Bourbon, Count of Vermandois, Louis XIV's natural son, born on 2 October 1667, who was condemned to life imprisonment for slapping the Dauphin in the face at the age of sixteen [‚Ä¶]\\" His face was covered with an iron mask having a chin strap with iron springs which allowed him to eat nevertheless. [‚Ä¶]\\" Pagnol sees in this a precaution taken in order to mask a characteristic dimple visible on numerous portraits of Louis XIV. In Sainte-Marguerite, probably because of the valet La Rivi√®re's death, \\"Dauger\\" was authorised to go for walks on the Island. However, the fortress of Sainte-Marguerite, unlike that in Exilles, was a real prison where Dauger was likely to meet other prisoners. He was therefore required to wear a mask, to which Marcel Pagnol does not refer during the previous imprisonments in Pignerol then Exilles. Some prisoners at the Bastille, especially young noblemen, asked for the permission to wear a mask so as not to be recognized by their guards or inmates after their imprisonment. Marcel Pagnol remains convinced that the prisoner was required to wear the mask.  Death certificate and grave  Marcel Pagnol reproduces the text of the death certificate on which the name Marchialy Chevalier, Major of the Bastille for over thirty years (1749-1787) wrote notes about each of the former prisoners. For those of the Mask, he notably added to du Junca's texts: \\"Buried in Saint-Paul, [‚Ä¶] under the name Marchiergues.\\" is written. The authenticity of that name has been denied by Jesuit writer Henri Griffet. As for the grave, Marcel Pagnol mentions a rumour according to which some drugs were inserted into the prisoner's coffin to consume the body, which he does not believe. He gives more credit to other rumours stating that when the grave was opened no coffin was found.Marcel Pagnol mentions rumours reported by historians such as G. Lenotre or Emile Laloy. It was also said that a large rock was found in the coffin. Louis XIV, who respected the \\"blue blood\\" of the princes, probably did not have his brother buried in a communal cemetery after such a privileged prison regime. The prisoner may rest under a false name in a monastery or a royal chapel.  Those who knew  = Those who lived on = * Saint-Mars and his lieutenants (his cousin Blainvilliers and his two nephews Formanoir): Pagnol considers that it is to their unbroken discretion that they owed their fortune, estimated at 5 billion francs (1960 value), including three seigniorial lands, ownership of which gave them noble status. As for Major Rosarges and the turnkey Antoine R√π, their appointment at the Bastille was a remarkable crowning achievement. * Abbot Giraud ‚Äì the prisoner's confessor, appointed assistant administrator of the Bastille. * Madame de Cavoye ‚Äì Louis and Eustache Dauger de Cavoye's mother. She was granted an allowance of 6000 livres i.e. 18 million francs in 1960 by the King and her son Louis was made a marquis. * Charles II ‚Äì Louis XIV (his first cousin) secretly paid him an important allowance over a long period, without any obvious reason. * Father Lachaise ‚Äì Louis XIV's confessor: Pagnol suspects him of having encouraged Louis XIV to revoke the Edict of Nantes, given that on his death bed he placed responsibility for it on the Church, in particular the two cardinals who came to his bedside. Having been warned that he would have to answer to God about his brother's detention, the Revocation was then supposedly suggested to him, deemed useful for his religion due to the Protestant plot of 1669. = Those who died because of it = * Henrietta of France, Queen of England and Louis XIII's sister: She is thought to be the one who sent the midwife Lady Perronette to Jersey to entrust the twin to the Carteret family. She was poisoned in September 1669 shortly after Roux de Marcilly's trial and most probably the confessions of the \\"false Dauger\\" in July. Pagnol gives details of her death reported by her historiographer Cotolendi: she died while sleeping, after Vallot, the King's doctor, had urged her to take opium grains despite her reluctance. * Henrietta of England ‚Äì Charles II's sister: She is thought to have been informed of the arrest of \\"valet Martin\\", Roux de Marcilly's accomplice, by a letter from Charles II who supposedly, in addition, asked her to tell Louis XIV the news. She died brutally on 30 June 1670, the day after the Treaty of Dover that she had secretly negotiated with Charles II at Louis XIV's request. Doctor Vallot, who treated her at the last and concluded that it was a natural death after performing her autopsy, is strongly suspected of having poisoned her, according to the declarations of the Princess herself heard by Ambassador Montaigu on her deathbed.Pagnol quotes a letter of 6 July 1670 written by the English ambassador Montaigu to Prime Minister Arlington. Montaigu was present at Madame's death: \\"This opinion is firmly based on the declarations of the Princess herself, repeated several times in the throes of agony‚Ä¶\\" King Charles II then asked Louis XIV for all the letters he had written to his sister. Yet the correspondence published stops on 24 June 1669. Pagnol deduces from this that Louis XIV systematically destroyed all the letters after Roux de Marcilly's execution, i.e. between 80 and 100 letters.According to the historian Cyril H. Hartmann, King Charles II and his sister Princess Henrietta of England wrote to each other twice a week after Henrietta's marriage in 1661. A large number of these letters are published in The King my Brother and Charles II and Madame. Pagnol also quotes the historian Julia Cartwright. * Mgr de Lionne ‚Äì he died mysteriously at the age of sixty on 1 September 1671, having recorded Roux de Marcilly's confession two years earlier. * Vallot ‚Äì he died suddenly on 16 July 1673. It was probably he who interrogated the prisoner with Louvois the day after his arrest, then in Pignerol in 1670. * Fouquet ‚Äì Imprisoned in Pignerol, he is thought to have confessed at the end of 1678 that he knew the secret of the prisoner called \\"Dauger\\" who had officially been made his valet four years earlier. He was poisoned in 1680. * La Rivi√®re ‚Äì Fouquet's valet during his imprisonment in Pignerol, he is thought to have also heard about the secret of the prisoner \\"Dauger\\". Following Fouquet's death in 1680, he was imprisoned alongside Dauger and died in Exilles in 1687 without ever having been accused or condemned. It should also be noticed that Lauzun, who was also imprisoned in Pignerol, and to whom Fouquet could have revealed the secret of \\"Dauger\\" during secret nocturnal conversations, was \\"spared\\" and released in 1681.Pagnol specifies that Lauzun remained under very close surveillance when released: he was required to stay in the provinces under the custody of a certain Mr de Maupertuis, captain of the musketeers and Saint-Mars's friend. Pagnol is apparently uncertain of what he knew (or did not know).Pagnol writes : \\"Fouquet certainly spoke to him about it [to Lauzun, about the mysterious prisoner], without revealing the secret to him, as he knew he was too talkative.\\" Was Louvois poisoned? In 1691, the secretary fell into disgrace, probably because he was disliked by Madame de Maintenon, Louis XIV's secret wife. He suddenly died whereas he was supposed to have been arrested and taken to the Bastille on the King's orders. French memorialist Saint-Simon quotes the account of Cl√©ran, his father's former equerry, who went to see Madame de Louvois before the minister's death. In Pagnol's opinion, Saint-Simon's text leaves no doubt that Louvois was poisoned by his doctor S√©ron Doctor S√©ron is thought to have died after locking himself in his bedroom for several hours, screaming about his guilt for \\"what he had done to his master.\\" on the discreet orders of the King,Saint-Simon carefully finishes the story of Louvois's death in order to avoid any accusation of the crime of lese-majesty: \\"Who did it? [‚Ä¶] What is certain is that the King was absolutely incapable of doing it, [‚Ä¶].\\" Pagnol regards this as no more than an \\"obligatory phrase\\". because of the secrets he held, concerning Fouquet's poisoning, the identity of the prisoner in the iron mask, and the death of Henrietta of France. Louis XIV then entrusted the War Ministry to Barbezieux, Louvois's son, who was just twenty-three years old at the time. Was Barbezieux bled to death? Although he was popular with \\"many beautiful ladies\\" (Pagnol describes him as a womaniser), Barbezieux is denounced by Saint Simon for being immature and irresponsible, apparently too young to inherit one of the most important ministries. Saint-Simon refers to Fagon, then chief physician to Louis XIV, who was accused of having deliberately bled Barbezieux excessively, leading to his death in 1701. Here again, according to Pagnol, the order to kill Barbezieux was implicitly given by Louis XIV. = Transmission of the secret = Louis XV Regularly questioned by his son (the dauphin, Louis XVI's father),According to the moralist S√©nac de Meilhan. his minister the Duke of Choiseul, his mistress Madame de Pompadour, and his valet Mr de la Borde, Louis XV proved elusive and refused to answer. Pagnol observes, however, that his evasive responses suggest that he knew the secret. Eventually he would answer Madame de Pompadour and say he was the \\"secretary of an Italian Prince‚Ä¶\\" thus referring to Matthioli. Pagnol asserts that he was in fact repeating the \\"fable\\" skilfully prepared by Louvois and Barbezieux, knowing perfectly well that it was a lie, as shown by his long silence, particularly toward his own son. Louis XVI Questioned by Marie-Antoinette, Louis XVI promised her he would carry out research. He spoke about this to a certain Mr de Maurepas, who associated with ministers who may have known the secret and asserted that \\"he was simply a [‚Ä¶] subject of the Duke of Mantoue\\", also referring to Matthioli. According to Pagnol, Louis XVI, who knew the secret, deferred to this Mr de Maurepas, who also repeated Louvois's \\"fable\\" rather than lie to the Queen. Marshal of Richelieu According to Marshal Richelieu's memoirs, published by Abbot Soulavie in 1790, the daughter of Regent Philippe d‚ÄôOrl√©ans supposedly heard from her father that the prisoner was Louis XIV‚Äòs twin-brother, the legitimate heir to the throne. These revelations were not taken seriously as Soulavie also asserts that to obtain this confidence, this girl is thought to have given favours to her father, which Pagnol disputes: Soulavie was writing during the Revolution and tried to appeal to the lower classes by denouncing the ignominy of the \\"tyrants\\" of the Monarchy. Besides, it is hard to believe the Regent was guilty of incest, he who had a great number of mistresses, and his daughter would have certainly not have prided herself on this. Louis XVIII Louis XVIII declared to his friend Duke de la Rochefoucauld, \\"I know the key to this mystery, as my successors will know it. It is our grand-father Louis XIV's honour that we must keep.\\" Pagnol believes this declaration to be sincere, explaining that Louis XVIII was able to keep the secret of his brother Louis XVI, a year older than him, and from whom he separated in 1791.  Witnesses  = Mr Du Junca, \\"King's Lieutenant\\" at the Bastille = Du Junca was the second in command at the prison after the governor. Marcel Pagnol quotes extracts from the records kept by Du Junca in which he reports the arrival at the Bastille of the prisoner brought in by Saint-Mars wearing \\"a black velvet mask\\", his death on 19 November 1703, and his burial at the cemetery of Saint- Paul the day after. The prisoner's death was registered under the name Marchiel. These records were documents meant for unofficial, personal use (as a form of reminder) and their authenticity and sincerity cannot be disputed. In any case, they constitute proof of the prisoner's existence, which is therefore not a legend. = Renneville = Pagnol quotes Constantin de Renneville, imprisoned at the Bastille in 1702, i.e. before the prisoner's death. Renneville's account in 1724 is the first public revelation concerning the unknown prisoner whom the turnkey Antoine R√ª said was imprisoned for 31 years for having written poetry critical of the Jesuits, something Pagnol considers \\"a ridiculous invention.\\" It seems that the prisoner whom Renneville met was not the famous Man in the Iron Mask, based on several aspects differing from other accounts: * Renneville gives physical descriptions without mentioning a mask: the prisoner would have been asked to turn around so as not to be recognised. * He said he met the prisoner in 1705, whereas the famous masked prisoner died at the end of 1703. * He describes him as being of \\"medium height\\", whereas Voltaire refers to him as \\"unusually tall\\".According to Lagrange-Chancel, Princess Palatine's butler, Louis XIV was \\"five feet eight inches tall,\\" or 1.84 meter. * He describes his \\"very thick black frizzy hair\\", while according to Blainvilliers's account the prisoner already had completely white hair before his imprisonment at the Bastille. The prisoner seen by Renneville could not be Count Matthioli imprisoned in 1679, i.e. 26 years of detention by 1705 rather than the 31 years mentioned. However, based on the \\"very thick black frizzy hair,\\" this may be the Mooress of Moret, born of adultery between Maria Theresa of Spain (the wife of Louis XIV) and a black slave, whom Pagnol never mentions in his essay. = Voltaire = Voltaire was imprisoned at the Bastille from May 1717 to April 1718, i.e. 14 years after the masked prisoner's death, and again in 1726. Pagnol considers him to have been the main initiator of the widespread curiosity regarding the mysterious prisoner. In 1738 he wrote that he had \\"spoken to people who served him,\\" making very little reference to his sources, at least in the extracts Pagnol gives in his investigation. Le Si√®cle de Louis XIV (The Age of Louis XIV) (1751) Pagnol mentions an extract in which Voltaire refers to the mysterious prisoner, imprisoned on the island of Sainte-Marguerite then at the Bastille. He describes an attractive and well-built young man wearing \\"a mask having a chin strap with iron springs\\", gives certain details testifying to a luxurious detention environment and the great respect and consideration with which he was treated by prominent citizens such as the Marquis de Louvois. In the 2nd edition (1752), Voltaire quotes an anecdote, during imprisonment in Sainte- Marguerite, concerning a silver plate on which the prisoner is thought to have written with a knife before throwing it out of the window and which was brought back to the governor by an obliging and illiterate fisherman. Voltaire also quotes Michel de Chamillart, secretary for war in 1701 (having succeeded Barbezieux), as the last secretary to keep the secret, and whose son-in-law the Second Marshall of La Feuillade is said to have failed to make him break his oath of silence. Chamillart is said to have revealed that this was a man \\"who knew all the secrets of Mr Fouquet.\\" Voltaire concludes from this that he had been kidnapped shortly after Cardinal Mazarin's death in 1661, which proved to be incorrect.Lamotte-Gu√©rin, lieutenant of the Islands (Saint-Mars's assistant) at the time of the prisoner's detention, corrects as follows: \\"This extraordinary event that he [Voltaire] identifies as taking place in 1661, a few months after Cardinal Mazarin's death, did not occur until 1669, eight years after the death of this Eminence.\\" Voltaire also wonders about such detention measures and state secrecy around a simple subordinate confidant. Questions on the Encyclopaedia Voltaire took up his pen once again after his enemy Fr√©ron's publications in 1768. In the Questions sur l'Encyclop√©die (1770), he declares that wearing the mask was enforced, including during medical examinations, for fear that \\"an overly striking resemblance [‚Ä¶] would be recognized\\" and quotes the apothecary of the Bastille's account, to whom the prisoner is thought to have told his age shortly before his death, saying he was \\"around sixty years old\\".The age of \\"approximately 60 years old\\" in 1703 (age 65, if born in 1638) rules out any identification of the prisoner as Fouquet, who would have been 88 years old in 1703. It is noticeable that the death certificate states a younger prisoner of \\"forty-five years old or thereabouts.\\" Voltaire also wonders about the Italian name he was given, most probably referring to the death certificate. The 1771 editor gives his version of the facts, which according to him is the version Voltaire could not explicitly give in his writings for fear of royal reprisals: The Queen who feared being unable to provide an heir to Louis XIII, gave birth to a first child and told the secret to Cardinal Mazarin who decided to arrange \\"the opportunity of a single bed for the King and the Queen,\\" whereas they had not lived together for a long time. This hypothesis, according to which the prisoner is thought to be Louis XIV's elder brother, is not based on any proof, on the other hand Pagnol does not put forward any information that would demonstrate it is wrong.This transcribed introduction to Questions on the Encyclopaedia could also be interpreted by forwarding the hypothesis that this elder brother of Louis XIV was in reality the son of Queen Marie-Th√©r√®se of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin (there is no obvious reason preventing him from being legitimately brought to the throne if he were Louis XIII's son), a theory to which Pagnol does not refer in his essay.Jean-Louis Carra, librarian at the Bastille, asserts in his M√©moires historiques (1789) that the masked prisoner was Louis XIV's elder brother. Pagnol considers this assertion as having \\"no valid proof.\\" = The letters to Fr√©ron = French journalist Elie Fr√©ron published letters in the periodic l‚ÄôAnn√©e litt√©raire in 1768. Letter from Lagrange-Chancel, imprisoned on the islands of Sainte-Marguerite from 1719 to 1722 Lagrange-Chancel reports the account of Mr de Lamotte-Gu√©rin's, governor of the Islands at the time of Lagrange-Chancel's imprisonment and lieutenant of the islands, therefore Saint-Mars's deputy, at least six years before the Prisoner's transfer to the Bastille. Lamotte-Gu√©rin, who therefore had access to the prison records, gives the date of the prisoner's arrest (1669). He spends time with the prisoner every day, for example when he accompanies Saint-Mars to serve the prisoner's meals, as Saint-Mars describes in a letter to Louvois in January 1696. Thirty years before the publication of Voltaire's The Age of Louis XIV, Lagrange-Chancel already refers to the consideration shown by Saint-Mars, the silver dishes and luxury clothes. The prisoner is identified as the Duke of Beaufort, who died at the Siege of Candia.In his Supplement to the Age of Louis XIV (1753), Voltaire writes: \\"It was not the Duke of Beaufort, who only disappeared at the Siege of Candia and whose corpse could not be distinguished as the Turks had cut off the head.\\" French writer Germain-Fran√ßois de Sainte-Foix also contradicts the identification of the prisoner as the Duke of Beaufort in his response to Lagrange Chancel's letter (reporting the ex-lieutenant Lamotte-Gu√©rin's assertion): \\"Monsieur de Beaufort actually died at Candia, [‚Ä¶]\\". Letter from Mr du Palteau (June 1768) Mr du Palteau was Guillaume de Formanoir's son, Saint-Mars's nephew and a cadet in the free company which will notably watch over the masked prisoner. Guillaume became a lieutenant in 1693 and most probably also accompanied Saint-Mars to serve the prisoner's meals. Pagnol describes him as \\"the best-informed of all witnesses.\\" He refers to the curiosity of his cousin Blainvilliers (Saint-Mars's first cousin) who disguises himself as a sentry in order to observe the prisoner under his bedroom window, a stopover by the prisoner in Palteau during transfer from Sainte-Marguerite to the Bastille, and farmers‚Äô accounts of having seen the prisoner sitting at the same table as Saint-Mars in his dining room. Blainvilliers, who is thought to have seen him without his mask, describes his physical appearance as \\"tall and well-built,\\" with grey hair and \\"nice clothes,\\" and reports a real royal ceremonial during the visits, which Pagnol compares to that established by Henri IV at court.At the court, the ceremonial etiquette imposed by Henry IV for meals was as follows: The King, his hat on his head, would go and sit at his place. All the guests would line up in front of him, standing and hatless. Then the king would signal them to put on their hats and be seated. Now, according to Blainvilliers: \\"The governor and officers remained in front of him, standing and hatless, until he had them put on their hats and sit down.\\" Pagnol concludes that the officers mentioned by Blainvilliers (including Blainvilliers himself) followed the same ceremonial etiquette in front of the masked prisoner as they would have done if dining at the King's table. He then mentions a \\"black mask\\" when Saint-Mars and the prisoner stop at Palteau. Mr du Palteau concludes by declaring: \\"I did not hear it said that he had a foreign accent,\\" most probably eliminating the hypothesis of a foreigner such as Matthioli. In his letter, he does not provide any theory regarding the prisoner's identity. In June 1768, doubtless following the reactions aroused by Fr√©ron's publications, he wrote that his account cannot \\"support any speculations produced until now.\\" Pagnol explains that he might have known the prisoner's identity, since it was a family matter, but that he was sworn to secrecy because of his membership of the Royal Academy of Agriculture. = Other accounts = Princess Palatine, duchess of Orl√©ans, the King's sister in law In a letter sent to the Princess of Hanover in 1711, i.e. 8 years after the prisoner's death, Princess Palatine identifies him as \\"an English milord who had been involved in the affair of the Duke of Berwick against King William II.\\" Pagnol explains that those in power \\"directed the suppositions towards some foreign lord\\", and he also refers to the Duke of MonmouthIn his Essais historiques, Saint-Foix \\"supports the candidacy\\" of the Duke of Monmouth, which Pagnol considers unacceptable considering that he was still in England sixteen years after the prisoner's detention. He commanded, for example, a victorious battalion at Bothwell Bridge on 22 June 1679. or Cromwell's son. An anonymous novel This is a tale, M√©moires secrets pour servir √† l‚Äôhistoire de la Perse (Confidential Memoirs Serving as a History of Persia) published in Amsterdam in 1745, using names from One Thousand and One Nights: while his death is announced, the Count of Vermandois, son of Louis XIV and the duchess Louise de La Valli√®re, is taken prisoner and masked by Louis XIV for having slapped the Dauphin.Father Griffet, Chaplain of the Bastille from 1745, also believed that the prisoner was Count Vermandois. In his Supplement to the Age of Louis XIV (1753), Voltaire writes: \\"It was certainly not the Duke of Vermandois,\\" without developing any counter-argument. Pagnol considers such a version \\"unacceptable\\" but all the same underlines the fact that the book was printed in Holland without any author's name, proving that the identity of the masked prisoner was still an important state secret in 1745, some 42 years after his death. Linguet, imprisoned for a long time at the Bastille. His account was recorded by La Borde, Louis XV's valet: \\"1. The prisoner wore a velvet mask and not an iron mask, at least during the time he spent at the Bastille. \\"2. The governor himself served him and took away his laundry. \\"3. When he went to mass, he was strictly forbidden to talk or show his face; the order was given to the veterans to shoot at him; [‚Ä¶] \\"4. When he died, everything was searched and burnt. [‚Ä¶]\\" 'The Duke of Saint-Simon', memorialist (and Lauzun's brother- in-law) The two brothers-in-lawLauzun and Saint-Simon's wives were the Marshall of Lorges's daughters. lived in Marly in a house where they shared a certain intimacy and Saint-Simon, according to what he says, had to \\"extract from him [Lauzun] stories of the past,\\" among which most probably were those about the mysterious prisoner, based on his nocturnal conversations with Fouquet in Pignerol. At his death in 1754, Saint-Simon left a large number of manuscripts, which were not published due to an \\"Order of the King\\" to keep them secret in 1760. After full examination by two of the King's historiographers, a first edition of the Memoirs was issued in 1830. Yet according to Fran√ßois-R√©gis Bastide, who examined the very first inventory: \\"One hundred and sixty-two portfolios are missing, which represents a quantity of writing work fifteen times larger than the Memoirs.\\" Pagnol concludes from this that Saint-Simon's Memoirs were expurgated on the King's order.  Complements  = Louis XIV = Louis XIV by Hyacinthe Rigaud (1701) To support his theory according to which Louis XIV supposedly ordered his own brother's imprisonment for life, harshening the sentence by making him wear a mask, Pagnol recounts several anecdotes from the childhood, reign and personal life of the \\"Sun King\\", revealing a vain, cruel and deceitful side, going so far as to suggest several orders to murder certain figures by poisoning them (in particular the minister Louvois, see section \\"Those who knew\\"). Finally he denounces the revocation of the Edict of Nantes as being his \\"main crime\\". A marked childhood Drawing on a book by Philippe Erlanger,Pagnol does not specify his source. It is most probably the biography of Louis XIV by Philippe Erlanger, published in 1960. Pagnol cites some premonitory anecdotes: examples of unreasonable and premature praise (under five years old), a night in small camp beds in St-Germain during the Fronde; the people besieging the royal palace and \\"dissidents\\" approaching the little king's bed to make sure of his presence, but who give rise to lingering grudges. Pagnol then quotes stories extracted from the Memoirs of Saint-Simon, depicting the King in all his deceit. The forbidden marriage of Mademoiselle and Lauzun Mademoiselle, Louis XIV's first cousin, possessed considerable properties, in particular the principality of Dombes and the comt√© of Eu. After having declared that he would not oppose her marriage to the Duke of Lauzun, the King had it cancelled the day before the ceremony planned for 18 December 1670. He then had Lauzun imprisoned in Pignerol (where he stayed for ten years) in order to exchange his freedom against the principality of Dombes and the comt√© of Eu, which he bequeathed to the Duke of Maine, his illegitimate son from his affair with Madame de Montespan. Once released, Lauzun is forced to stay in the provinces, under the custody of a captain of the musketeers, and the King still forbids his marriage. Philippe d‚ÄôOrl√©ans Louis XIV also betrayed his nephew Philippe d‚ÄôOrl√©ans by disinheriting him and by designating the Duke of Maine as regent of the Kingdom. He informed him of this as he was lying on his deathbed, after the last rites, indulging in speeches and outbursts of great hypocrisy. \\"Monsieur\\" Philippe d'Orl√©ans ‚Äì his younger brother Louis XIV also took sanctions against his brother Monsieur when he commanded the victorious army of William of Orange at the Battle of Cassel in 1677. Jealous of this remarkable success, Louis XIV gave him no further commanding role. \\"Disaster\\" of Fargues During a major hunting trip near Dourdan, the Count of Guiche, the Count of Lude, Vardes, the Duke of Lauzun (who recounted the adventure to Saint-Simon) and other courtiers got lost in the forest after the King had returned. They asked then for hospitality at the house of a certain Fargues, who warmly welcomed them, offering an excellent meal and rooms for the night. But Fargues, who at the time of the Paris Revolt incurred the wrath of the Court and in particular of Cardinal Mazarin, had chosen to discreetly withdraw and be forgotten. Following the hunting adventure, the King and the Queen, furious to learn that Fargues was living quietly so close to Paris, asked Lamoignon, first President of the Parliament of Paris, to investigate his past. Lamoignon found a way to implicate Fargues in a murder committed during a period of troubles, on which ground Fargues was arrested and executed despite the protection of amnesty. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes The Edict of Nantes, an edict of tolerance promulgated in April 1598 by King Henry IV of France which put an end to religious wars by granting certain rights to Protestants, was revoked by Louis XIV in October 1685. Pagnol denounces this as the \\"main crime\\" committed by Louis XIV, and the catalyst for a real civil war in France involving huge \\"massacres\\". Indeed, Louis XIV would later realise this. On his deathbed, anxious to escape Catholic hell, he turned to Cardinals de Rohan and de Bissy, holding them responsible for everything. Posterity, laudatory slogans If they wished to protect their professional survival, writers, poets and authors of that time had no choice but to win the King's favour. According to Pagnol, it was thus flattery from figures such as Boileau, Moli√®re etc. which ensured Louis XIV's posthumous glory. He was assigned the name of \\"Louis le Grand\\" by an assembly of prominent figures at his own orders, rather than elevated by History for the greatness of his reign. = Count Matthioli = Ercole Antonio Matthioli, was born in Bologna in 1640, and was appointed deputy to the Duke of Mantoue (in present Lombardy) which made him a count, a title that Marcel Pagnol describes as \\"not very serious\\". In 1678, the Duke of Mantoue secretly asked Matthioli to negotiate the sale of the stronghold of Casal with Louis XIV (in what is now Piedmont), a real strategic point close to the French border, explaining why he was generously rewarded by Louis XIV. However, he revealed the secret at the Court of Turin, which then spreads as far as Spain. The treaty is therefore not ratified. Louis XIV, feeling deceived and ridiculed, had him kidnapped and imprisoned in Pignerol in May 1679, then on the Islands of Sainte-Marguerite, where he died in 1694, most probably of exhaustion caused by the walk from Pignerol to the Islands, about a hundred kilometres. The \\"Matthiolist\\" theories Pagnol quotes certain theories identifying the masked prisoner as Count Matthioli, such as those of Marius Topin, or the historian Funck Brentano, particularly due to the name Marchialy written on the death certificate, which could be a distortion of \\"Matthioli\\". Pagnol rejects this theory using several arguments: * The dungeon: it was in 1669 that the first dungeon of the masked prisoner was built in Pignerol, yet Matthioli was imprisoned only ten years later. Being locked in the same dungeon as a Jacobin monk, he therefore does not hold any dangerous secret. * The time of captivity: in a letter written in 1691, Barbezieux refers to \\"the masked prisoner that you [Saint-Mars] have kept for twenty years\\" (more precisely 22 years ‚Äì since 1669). Yet Saint-Mars had at the time kept Matthioli for only two and a half years in Pignerol, since his imprisonment in May 1679. Matthioli stayed in Pignerol after Saint-Mars's departure to Exiles in October 1681. * The prisoner's transportation: the prisoner was transferred to Exiles on the Islands of Sainte-Marguerite in an oilcloth litter, a means of transport which was not deployed for Matthioli. He walked from Pignerol to the Islands while sick, and seemingly died of exhaustion on his arrival in the Islands. * Furthermore, Italians were chosen to carry the oilcloth litter which covered the prisoner. Yet according to Pagnol, carriers who did not speak the prisoner's language were chosen to prevent him from making revelations, which indicates that the prisoner was not Italian. * Finally, Pagnol thinks it unlikely that the prisoner would be identified by his name (corrupted as Marchialy) on the death certificate after his identity had been kept secret for 34 years.

Mauri Aukusti Sariola (25 November 1924 ‚Äì 9 August 1985) was a crime writer from Finland. His books have been sold more than two million copies. They have been translated to more than 10 languages. In addition to crime fiction, Sariola wrote war books and non-fiction.  Biography  Mauri Sariola was born in Helsinki and spent his childhood in Hattula. He learned conservative values from his home. Sariola participated in the Continuation War as a radio officer, and got some combat experience in the Lapland War. After the war he studied law for some years in Helsinki University, but never graduated. Sariola worked at a law firm, in a bank, as a primary school teacher and a journalist. He was a crime reporter at Helsingin Sanomat for ten years before becoming a freelance writer. Sariola occupied a central place in the Finnish mystery scene for decades, and published more than 80 books. Mauri Sariola died from complications after a gallstone operation in Helsinki on August 9, 1985.  Writing  Sariola's best-known characters include Inspector Olavi Susikoski, the hero of more than 30 novels, and lawyer Matti Viima, the central character in five novels. First Susikoski books were published in 1956. After Sariola's death, his widow and fans have published more Susikoski books. Susikoski was based on a real-life policeman Martti Salander, whom Sariola had learned to know during his years as crime reporter. Sariola had conservative values, and described eternal fight of the good and the evil. The criminals are nearly superhuman, and their motivation is explained to justify their needs. The murderers often kill for saving their honor. Women are described superficially, they are either decadent vamps or clean family girls. Sariola was loved by his audience, but not so much by the critics. Some of his books were written very hastily.

After about seven months of courting, James proposes in November, but Hazel declines his proposal and tearfully refuses him. She doesn't tell him that she was married before to a violent alcoholic named Patrick O'Connor. Hazel's sad past is now the Forrest's family secret. James don't know why she refuses him. This causes Hazel's father, Arthur Forrest, to visit James. He informs James of Forrest's family secret and reveals the family secret. He explains that Hazel was previously married to a drunk, Patrick O'Connor, who beat her. They divorced and Hazel moved back in with her parents. Mr. Forrest wants his daughter to be happy, while the prickly Mrs. Forrest is sure the Bellamys would never accept Hazel as a divorced woman (divorce being the shocking, stigmatic thing it was in 1912).

The scheme was launched in November 2016 after more than two years of deliberation. Businesses who have been unsuccessful in a credit application process with a bank will be asked for their permission to have their financial information passed to designated finance platforms, who can contact the business in a regulated time-frame. The three designated finance platforms selected are Funding Options, Funding Xchange and Alternative Business Funding. The Sunday Times reported in March 2017 that since the launch, the scheme has seen low numbers of referrals. Of the businesses which have been declined by the high street banks, less than 24 percent have been referred to the Designated Platforms.  How the Referral Scheme works  The bank referral scheme imposes a statutory duty on selected UK high street banks to pass on businesses who have been unsuccessful in applying for finance to the three designated alternative finance platforms, who will then email or phone the businesses to offer their service. If a business chooses to interact with any of the finance platforms they fill in a few questions and the finance platform runs the data against their panel of finance providers to see if there are any potential matches. If there are matches the business can then choose whether to make contact with a finance provider and then and only then is their data shared with that finance provider. Funding available through the bank referral scheme covers term lending, receivables finance, asset finance, commercial property finance and online lenders, as well as government-backed and not-for-profit lenders. None of the three finance platforms support equity finance. For the referral scheme to perform as envisaged by the UK Government, the businesses affected must give formal permission to the bank to pass on their information to platforms. Business owners have expressed concern and confusion as to how the referral scheme will perform in practice.  Concerns  Concerns have centred around the high-interest rates that are charged by alternative finance providers, how confidential information will be treated by the designated platforms who are small start-up businesses and the possibility of being contacted by a number of unknown companies who have had access to confidential business and financial information.  Background  The idea of the bank referral scheme was advocated by the Liberal Democrats under Nick Clegg with the former Liberal Democrat Business Secretary, Sir Vince Cable hinting at it in March 2014. The then Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne announced in August 2014 the scheme; after a five-month industry consultation selected British Business Bank (the UK's state development bank) to run the assessment process to recommend three designated finance platforms on behalf of HM Treasury. The scheme which was included in the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 was given Royal Assent in March 2015. The implementation of the scheme was slowed down by a multitude of logistical problems such as how and when a bank should refer a business to the alternative finance sector. A year after the announcement of the scheme, there was no progress and the scheme seemed to have been forgotten. The bank referral scheme was launched on 1 November 2016 after a further two-month delay.

In 1993, he immigrated as a refugee with his family to Plainsboro Township, New Jersey under the Lautenberg amendment of 1990. Epshteyn is a graduate of Georgetown University School of Foreign Service (BSFS, 2004). During his time as an undergraduate at Georgetown, Epshteyn became a brother of the Eta Sigma chapter of the Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi) fraternity.\\"Notable Alumni\\", aepi.org. He graduated from the Georgetown University Law Center with a J.D. degree. Career Following his graduation from law school, Epshteyn was part of the finance practice of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy New York. He worked on securities transactions, private placements, and bank finance. In 2008, Epshteyn was a communications aide with the McCain-Palin campaign. While at the campaign, he was part of a rapid response task force which concentrated on issues related to the vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. Epshteyn was managing director of business and legal affairs at the boutique investment bank West America Securities Corporation until the firm was expelled from the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency in 2013.

It stood on London Road, Southborough, Kent and opened on 17 January 1900 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. A significant sum for the construction costs was raised by Sir David Lionel Goldsmid-Stern-Salomons, 2nd Baronet, who resided at nearby Broomhill. Sir David is the nephew of Sir David Salomons the 1st Baronet. Such was his standing that he unusually obtained permission to use the Royal Coat of Arms for the theatre on the proscenium arch above the stage.  Design  The design of Royal Victoria Hall is based on the Sir David Lionel's notable Science Theatre at Broomhill. The Courier article 25 January 1900 cited the altruistic nature of Sir David Lionel insisting on using local labour and materials where possible, notably including bricks manufactured in nearby High Brooms Sir David Lionel was a meticulous designer. The rake of the seating enhanced the comfort of the theatre goers. The proscenium is extremely rare nowadays. There were ladies and gentlemen's green rooms either side of the stage. The kitchen was in the basement to allow substantial catering when the theatre converted to a Hall, Indeed, many large functions were held at the Hall.  Frontage  The original frontage included wrought iron canopy. There was a gated and wrought iron fence to separate the road, this was later replaced with brick wall. In the 1970s. the frontage was substantially refurbished to allow alterations externally. The design then matched the next door, and earlier built, Council Offices.  Commemorative plaque  In 1909, a commemorative plaque was unveiled by dignitaries, recognising the significant contribution of Sir David Lionel. The inscription states \\"This hall was erected in 1899, to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria's reign. Three-quarters of the cost was contributed by Sir David Salomons, Bart[Baronet], of Broomhill, the remainder by the [Southborough] Urban District Council upon the condition that the hall should be under the control of the Urban District Council for the benefit of the inhabitants of Southborough.  Royal Connections  Such was Sir David Lionel's connections, he sought use of the prefix Royal for the Victoria Hall, despite Queen Victoria not having visited the Hall. Her Majesty granted a licence to use the Royal Coat of Arms on September 5, 1899. The Hall was opened on Wednesday January 17, 1900, with two patriotic concerts in aid of the Transvaal War Fund.  Events, concerts, radio shows, and pantomimes  The Royal Victoria Hall was meticulously designed to hold a variety of functions to maximise usability. Whilst the latter years became synonymous with pantomimes, Royal Victoria Hall has hosted a wide variety of events including a Fleetwood Mac concert in 1971, various live Radio 2 shows with Don Dubridge and Paul James, and even speeches by Enoch Powell in 1969 and 1978. http://enochpowell.info/Resources/Nov- Dec%201969.pdfhttp://enochpowell.info/Resources/Oct-Dec%201978.pdf  Demolition  Demolition commenced in May 2017 to be replaced by a modern development of Council Offices and ancillary facilities.

They are active in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The party are close to the New IRA. Saoradh's emblem combines the sunburst flag with the socialist red star, a pike, and the three national colours of Ireland: green, white and orange. History =Foundation= The party was founded in 2016. The 12 person national executive of the party sat at the top table under a banner of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation. The national executive was composed of republican activists, including: *Nuala Perry (vice-chairperson and former Provisional IRA prisoner), *Kevin Murphy (a former Real IRA prisoner), *Risteard √ì Murch√∫, *Sharon Rafferty, *Dee Fennell, *David Jordan, *Mandy Duffy, a sister-in-law of Colin Duffy. A third of the executive was female, while out of all 150 in attendance, men outnumbered women 10 to 1. Prominent republican dissidents were in attendance these included: *brothers Colin and Paul Duffy, *Sharon Girvan, *Thomas Ashe Mellon. A message of support from veteran republican leader Billy McKee was read out and a statement from New IRA prisoners expressing their support for the party was read out by Mellon. David Jordan said being elected chairman of the party was \\"humbling, daunting, intimidating yet empowering\\". Chair of the Association of Palestinian Communities in Scotland (APCS), Issam Hijjawi, also spoke. On the same day Saoradh issued the following press release: > Today, Saturday the 24th of September 2016, we a significant collective of > Irish Republican activists, who for a number of years have acted > autonomously, have after a number of years of debate, consultation and > organisation today in Ard Fheis organised, constituted and launched a > Revolutionary Irish Republican Party, the Party's name is Saoradh. Saoradh > believes that Ireland should be governed by the Irish People with the wealth > and wealth producing mechanisms in the ownership of the Irish People. This > can not happen while British imperialism undemocratically retains control of > Irish destinies and partitions our nation, this cannot happen while a neo- > colonial elite in a subservient supposed indigenous administration sell‚Äôs > the nation‚Äôs labour and natural resources to international capital. Saoradh > does not believe that British imperialism or capitalist exploitation can be > confronted in the structures they have created to consolidate their > undemocratic control of the Irish nation. As such we believe any assembly > claiming to speak for the Irish People without being elected by the united > people of the Irish nation to be illegal.

Democratic Unionist Party MLA Lord Maurice Morrow said that the action showed that dissidents \\"realise they are failing to gain support in their campaign and have moved into the political sphere\\". He added that it \\"will be very interesting to see what, if any, support this new political party will have\\". Ulster Unionist Party declared that it welcomed anyone engaging in the political process but that Saoradh have adopted \\"a tired and outdated abstentionist programme that has failed in the past and will fail again\\". Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said that former IRA members have for years been \\"lauded as statesmen and elevated to the highest offices in the land after gaining their status off the back of the Provisional IRA terror campaign\\". He asked \\"Will Saoradh follow the trajectory of Sinn F√©in and gain politically from violence?\\" Sinn F√©in said that its vision and analysis have won the support of half a million voters and that they \\"encourage genuine political debate within republicanism\\". =Junior McDaid House= In November 2016, the wife of IRA volunteer James \\"Junior\\" McDaid (shot dead by the 25th Light Regiment Royal Artillery in 1972) criticised Saoradh after they named their Derry offices on Chamberlain Street \\"Junior McDaid House\\" after her husband. She said nobody had invited her or told her the branch would be named after him, and added that she didn't know if he would have approved of it.McDaid House will allow us to rebuild: Mellon =Recent= In April 2019; it was announced that the headquarters: Junior McDaid House was closed due to them being given a notice to quit by the landlord of the building Tracey Murray. In August 2019; Saoradh chairman Brian Kenna announced that a continuation of dissident republican violence is 'inevitable'. In August 2019; Saoradh held demonstrations in Glasgow. Shooting of Lyra McKee On 18 April 2019, investigative journalist Lyra McKee was murdered while observing rioting in the Creggan district of Derry. Mobile phone footage was released showing a masked gunman opening fire with a handgun. Saoradh subsequently released a statement that \\"a republican volunteer attempted to defend people from the PSNI/RUC\\", after an \\"incursion\\" by \\"heavily armed crown forces\\", and that McKee was \\"killed accidentally\\". Saoradh held an Easter Rising commemoration parade in front of the General Post Office, the main site of the Rising in 1916, in Dublin on Easter Saturday, 21 April, less than three days after the death of McKee. The parade featured members dressed in paramilitary-style clothing. It was condemned by Ministers in the current D√°il √âireann government with Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan labeling it as \\"disturbing\\". Four days after the shooting, friends of McKee gathered in protest at Saoradh's headquarters, Junior McDaid House, and used red paint to place handprints on the walls of the building to \\"show that the blood is on their hands\\". Clashes with PSNI =Alleged mistreatment of children by the police= During a stop and search operation, the 10 year-old daughter of Saoradh member Damhnaic Mac Eochaidh was spoken to by the PSNI. Saoradh claimed the PSNI were \\"hyper-aggressive and heavily armed\\". Saoradh was outraged, saying that it was \\"state-sponsored child abuse\\" and called upon the commissioner for children and young people to meet with them to discuss the \\"ongoing abuse of our children at the hands of the state\\". =Alleged harassment by the police= Since Saoradh's foundation, party members allege they have been subject to regular house raids, stop and search, abuse, vehicle searches, heavy handedness and theft of personal items such as their children's Christmas presents and cars. They have called the PSNI draconian. Policies and ideology Saoradh seeks to establish a 32-county socialist republic across the island of Ireland, regarding Northern Ireland's status in the UK as an \\"illegal occupation\\". It is opposed to the current power-sharing government in Northern Ireland and is highly critical of Sinn F√©in, whom the party's former chairman David Jordan describes as \\"false prophets who have been defeated and consumed by the very system they claim to oppose\\". The party also views the government of the Republic of Ireland as illegitimate as it is not elected by the people of the whole island. As part of this, Saoradh supports the release of all republican prisoners. It may in future contest elections, but candidates elected to D√°il √âireann or the Northern Ireland Assembly will not take their seats. it has produced one position paper, on Brexit, and is discussing internally its stance on other issues. Wider links A report in the Sunday Life claimed that Saoradh is linked to the \\"New IRA\\", a group formed in 2012 by the merger of the Real Irish Republican Army with several other paramilitary groups. However David Jordan has stated that the party is \\"stand alone\\" and has no links to any other organisation.

It is operated by volunteers during weekends between late March and late October.  History  = The forest railway = Halyagos terminus in 1991 The first railway line in Kemence was laid in 1910 between Kemence and Kir√°lyh√°za. The Csarnav√∂lgy line, that is still in operation, was opened in 1913. After the two main lines were opened, several other minor railroads were constructed, most of them serving only some years. Every line was created to continuously slope in the direction of the village, therefore horses (and later locomotives) were required only to distribute the empty carriages in the morning, and then, when the cars were loaded, they were only needed to be braked by a brakeman, the gravity successfully carried the cars down. Throughout its history before 2000, the Kemence Forest Railway was never meant to transport passengers. There were no settlements around the railroad, and the forestry was not interested in creating a tourist railway. The first bridge in 1986, before the flood damages The widespread of forestal roads meant that the railway has a dark future ahead itself. In 1968, the Kir√°lyh√°za line was abandoned. The last remaining Csarnav√∂lgy line survived it with 22 years, officially closing in 1992, however, it had almost no function in its last years. However, the tracks remained, and the forestry didn't sell it. = A disastrous decade = After its abandonment, the conditions were fastly declining. In the last few years, only one locomotive remained viable. The track conditions became poor, with some of the rails being stolen. The first bridge in 2002, shortly before its restoration In 1995, a flood damaged two of the bridges and some of the railroad embankment, and an even stronger one in 1999 destroyed almost everything in the valley, ruining all bridges except one, while only the tracks in the village's outer parts survived. = New times = Seeing the saddening fate of the railway, volunteers decided to save this unique railway. From 1 January 2000, the Kisvasutak Bar√°ti K√∂re Egyes√ºlet (\\"Association of Narrow Gauge Railway Friends\\") loans the track and the properties from the forestry. This was the first time the Kemence railway ‚Äì renamed to its current name, Kemence Forest Museum Railway, referring to the museal rolling stock, most of which was saved from other 600 mm gauge railways that ceased to exist ‚Äì became a tourist railway. In the first four years, the railway operated in a short, but after the flood, intactly remained 1.8 km section between Kemence and God√≥v√°r-Strand. After restoring three bridges and several stolen sections, the line was extended with another additional 1.8 km, to the now defunct Pityur-r√©tje station. Feketev√∂lgy station was reached in 2009, and its second platform was built in 2015.  Today  In January 2017, the railway is 4.1 kilometers long, with an additional 3.1 km waiting for renovation. Electric locomotive in front of the depot, with a homemade passenger car The rolling stock is very heterogeneous: the locomotives are mostly consisting of MD-40 locomotives either originating to Kemence, or found and saved from defunct railways, but you can find Ue-28 and MV engines as well, and Kemence is the sole forest railway in Hungary where electric (El-9) locomotives can be found. The passenger cars are mostly locally built.

It resulted in the resignation of England national football team manager Sam Allardyce after only one game in charge, as well as the sacking or suspension of numerous English Football League club staff, including Barnsley assistant manager Tommy Wright. Events On 26 September, The Daily Telegraph published footage filmed by undercover reporters in which then England manager Sam Allardyce is shown speaking with fictitious Asian businessmen, detailing how to get around FIFA and Football Association bans on third-party ownership of football players, before making derogatory comments about former England assistant manager Gary Neville and previous England manager Roy Hodgson. Allardyce subsequently spoke about HM Revenue and Customs, calling them the \\"most corrupt business in the world\\", Allardyce himself having been caught up in alleged tax fraud schemes in the past. Following the revelations by The Daily Telegraph, the FA and Allardyce agreed on 27 September for him to resign as England manager with immediate effect by mutual consent, with Gareth Southgate being named as caretaker manager. Following Allardyce's departure, The Daily Telegraph published further details of much wider-reaching corruption through English club football, claiming that eight Premier League managers accepted \\"bungs\\" for player transfers. On 27 September, The Daily Telegraph revealed that the Barnsley assistant manager Tommy Wright had taken a ¬£5000 \\"bung\\" in order to arrange for the club to purchase part-owned players from a fictitious Far East firm. He was initially suspended by Barnsley as they launched an investigation into the allegations; he was sacked on 28 September. On 28 September, it was claimed by The Daily Telegraph that Queens Park Rangers manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink had agreed to become an ambassador for a fictitious Far East sports company involved in third-party ownership of players in exchange for ¬£55,000, subsequently also discussing potential tax avoidance involving his bank account in the Netherlands. Hasselbaink denied the claim, although he admitted he had been naive, and was supported by Queens Park Rangers after their internal investigation. Leeds United chairman Massimo Cellino was shown on video agreeing to sell 20% of the club in order to work around third-party player ownership rules. On 29 September, The Daily Telegraph released further footage from their investigation, alleging to show the assistant manager of Southampton, Eric Black, advising fictitious businessmen on how to bribe lower league clubs. Additionally, Jimmy Houtput, chairman of Belgian First Division B club Oud-Heverlee Leuven, allegedly offered his club as a \\"conduit\\" in order to aid third-party companies in gaining ownership of football players in England. Houtput resigned as OH Leuven chairman the following day. Reaction Then Wales manager Chris Coleman commented that corruption in the football industry should be punished by lifetime bans for the perpetrators. Former player and pundit Alan Shearer was particularly critical, claiming he \\"didn't think England could stoop any lower\\" following the England team's 1‚Äì2 loss to Iceland during UEFA Euro 2016 three months earlier, and called the team \\"a laughing stock of world football\\". Aftermath Robert Sullivan, Director of Strategy at the FA, later confirmed to the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that Allardyce's comments were \\"a factual, correct statement around the laws of the English game and having third-party ownership\\" Following a review by City of London Police, Allardyce was cleared of any wrongdoing with the Daily Telegraph also clarifying that it \\"did not suggest that Allardyce had broken the law\\", though he agreed that he had been \\"a fool\\". However, a criminal investigation was launched into Tommy Wright. He was convicted of soliciting and accepting bribes in December 2019. Speaking to the Observer, Martin Glen, CEO of the FA, said that \\"it is a tragedy that we have ended up having to part company with him [Allardyce] over the, the ‚Äì you know ‚Äì entrapment\\".

Scaplen's Court is a fifteenth century Grade I listed house in Poole, Dorset, England, adjacent to the Poole Museum. The house is now used as a museum focusing on life in Poole between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries, and includes a Victorian schoolroom and kitchen. History Scaplen's Court was originally built in the late fifteenth century as a house for a rich merchant, and the style of the house was indicative of the prosperity of Poole at the time. The house was originally L-shaped, and was built of Purbeck and Bath stone, and cobbles from Poole Quay. The history of the house is uncertain, but a doorway in the courtyard display the Poole shield of arms. It is believed that a maid named Agnes Beard was murdered at the house in 1598, and there are suggestions that her ghost haunts the house. It has also been suggested by local historians that the building may have been Poole's Old Town House, the first guildhall in the town, and that in the seventeenth century it was known as the George's Inn, and was occupied by the Roundheads during the English Civil War. During the eighteenth century, the house was acquired by John Scaplen, after whom the building is now named. In 1927, the Society of Poole Men bought the house for ¬£16,000 and spent ¬£430 on renovating the property. During the renovation, a shilling from the time of Mary I was found at the house. The building was opened to the public for the first time in 1929. In 1931, the house obtained a map believed to be the oldest map of Poole, which dated from 1643. The museum became a Grade I listed building in 1954, and was restored in 1986. In 2006/7, the museum was used to dry an Iron Age boat that had been recovered from Poole Harbour in 1964; the boat is now on display at the nearby Poole Museum.

Adaptations in humans can be physiological, genetic, or cultural, which allow people to live in a wide variety of climates. There has been a great deal of research done on developmental adjustment, acclimatization, and cultural practices, but less research on genetic adaptations to cold and heat temperatures. The human body always works to remain in homeostasis. One form of homeostasis is thermoregulation. Body temperature varies in every individual, but the average internal temperature is 37.0 ¬∞C (98.6 ¬∞F). Stress from extreme external temperature can cause the human body to shut down. Hypothermia can set in when the core temperature drops to 35 ¬∞C (95 ¬∞F). Hyperthermia can set in when the core body temperature rises above 37.5-38.3 ¬∞C (99.5-100.9 ¬∞F). These temperatures commonly result in mortality. Humans have adapted to living in climates where hypothermia and hyperthermia are common primarily through culture and technology, such as the use of clothing and shelter.  Origin of cold and heat adaptations  Modern humans emerged from Africa approximately 40,000 years ago during a period of unstable climate, leading to a variety of new traits among the population. When modern humans spread into Europe, they outcompeted Neanderthals. Researchers hypothesize that this suggests early modern humans were more evolutionarily fit to live in various climates. This is supported in the variability selection hypothesis proposed by Richard Potts, which says that human adaptability came from environmental change over the long term. = Ecogeographic rules = Bergmann‚Äôs rule states that endothermic animal subspecies living in colder climates have larger bodies than that of the subspecies living in warmer climates. Individuals with larger bodies are better suited for colder climates because larger bodies produce more heat due to having more cells, and have a smaller surface area to volume ratio compared to smaller individuals, which reduces heat loss. A study by Frederick Foster and Mark Collard found that Bergmann‚Äôs rule can be applied to humans when the latitude and temperature between groups differ widely. Allen‚Äôs rule is a biological rule that says the limbs of endotherms are shorter in cold climates and longer in hot climates. Limb length affects the body‚Äôs surface area, which helps with thermoregulation. Shorter limbs help to conserve heat, while longer limbs help to dissipate heat. Marshall T. Newman argues that this can be observed in Eskimo, who have shorter limbs than other people and are laterally built.  Physiological adaptations  Origins of heat and cold adaptations can be explained by climatic adaptation.\\"Climate Effects On Human Evolution\\". 2018. The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program. http://humanorigins.si.edu/research/climate-and-human-evolution/climate- effects-human- evolution. Ambient air temperature affects how much energy investment the human body must make. The temperature that requires the least amount of energy investment is 21 ¬∞C (69.8 ¬∞F). The body controls its temperature through the hypothalamus. Thermoreceptors in the skin send signals to the hypothalamus, which indicate when vasodilation and vasoconstriction should occur. = Cold = The human body has two methods of thermogenesis, which produces heat to raise the core body temperature. The first is shivering, which occurs in an unclothed person when the ambient air temperature is under 25 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F). It is limited by the amount of glycogen available in the body. The second is non-shivering, which occurs in brown adipose tissue. Population studies have shown that the San tribe of Southern Africa and the Sandawe of Eastern Africa have reduced shivering thermogenesis in the cold, and poor cold induced vasodilation in fingers and toes compared to that of Caucasians. = Heat = The only mechanism the human body has to cool itself is by sweat evaporation. Sweating occurs when the ambient air temperatures is above 35 ¬∞C (95 ¬∞F) and the body fails to return to the normal internal temperature. The evaporation of the sweat helps cool the blood beneath the skin. It is limited by the amount of water available in the body, which can cause dehydration. Humans adapted to heat early on. In Africa, the climate selected for traits that helped us stay cool. Also, we had physiological mechanisms that reduced the rate of metabolism and that modified the sensitivity of sweat glands to provide an adequate amount for cooldown without the individual becoming dehydrated.\\"Climate Effects On Human Evolution\\". 2018. The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program. http://humanorigins.si.edu/research/climate-and-human-evolution/climate- effects-human- evolution. There are two types of heat the body is adapted to, humid heat and dry heat, but the body has adapted to both in the same way. Humid heat is characterized by warmer temperatures with a high amount of water vapor in the air. Humid heat is dangerous as the moisture in the air prevents the evaporation of sweat. Dry heat is characterized by warmer temperatures with little to no water vapor in the air, such as desert conditions. Dry heat is also very dangerous as sweat will tend to evaporate extremely quickly, causing dehydration. Both humid heat and dry heat favor individuals with less fat and slightly lower body temperatures.\\"Climatic Adaptation  Physical Anthropology\\". 2018. Encyclopedia Britannica.https://www.britannica.com/science/climatic-adaptation. = Acclimatization = When humans are exposed to certain climates for extended periods of time, physiological changes occur to help the individual adapt to hot or cold climates. This helps the body conserve energy.  Cold  The Inuit have more blood flowing into their extremities, and at a hotter temperature, than people living in warmer climates. A 1960 study on the Alacaluf Indians shows that they have a resting metabolic rate 150 to 200 percent higher than the white controls used. Lapps do not have an increase in metabolic rate when sleeping, unlike non-acclimated people. Aboriginal Australians undergo a similar process, where the body cools but the metabolic rate does not increase.  Heat  Humans in Central Africa have been living in similar tropical climates for at least 40,000 years, which means that they have similar thermoregulatory systems. A study done on the Bantus of South Africa showed that Bantus have a lower sweat rate than that of acclimated and nonacclimated whites. A similar study done on Aboriginal Australians produced similar results, with Aboriginals having a much lower sweat rate than whites.  Culture  Social adaptations enabled early modern humans to occupy environments with temperatures that were drastically different from that of Africa. (Potts 1998). Culture enabled humans to expand their range to areas that would otherwise be uninhabitable. = Cold = Humans have been able to occupy areas of extreme cold through clothing, buildings, and manipulation of fire. Furnaces have further enabled the occupation of cold environments. Historically many Indigenous Australians wore only genital coverings. Studies have shown that the warmth from the fires they build is enough to keep the body from fighting heat loss through shivering. Eskimos use well-insulated houses that are designed to transfer heat from an energy source to the living area, which means that the average indoor temperature for coastal Eskimos is 10 to 20 ¬∞C (50-68 ¬∞F). = Heat = Humans inhabit hot climates, both dry and humid, and have done so for thousands of years. Selective use of clothing and technological inventions such as air conditioning allows humans to thrive in hot climates. One example is the Chaamba Arabs, who live in the Sahara Desert. They wear clothing that traps air in between skin and the clothes, preventing the high ambient air temperature from reaching the skin.  Genetic adaptations  There has been very little research done in the genetics behind adaptations to heat and cold stress. Data suggests that certain parts of the human genome have only been selected for recently. Research on gene-culture interaction has been successful in linking agriculture and lactose tolerance. However, most evidence of links between culture and selection has not been proven. This last question, anyhow, is a central topic of behavioral epigenetics.

He grew up on a farm in Coffee County, Tennessee and competed in the first Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration. Besides breeding horses, he was a horse trainer for several years, but quit riding due to health issues. He was married to his wife Nellie for 70 years, and was inducted into both the Tennessee Walking Horse Hall of Fame and the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame. Life Brantley was born on his family's farm in Coffee County, Tennessee on November 12, 1924. He was the son of French and Mary Wilson Brantley, and grandson of James Brantley. He had two brothers and a sister. He graduated from Manchester High School in 1943. That same year, he joined the United States Navy during World War II. He rose to the rank of CM2. While in the navy, he received a shaving kit sent to him by Nellie Wright, a girl he had attended school with. When the kit was stolen, he began writing to Nellie, and after his discharge they married in 1946. The couple were married 70 years. Career Brantley's grandfather James Brantley owned the crossbred stallion Black Allan, also known as Allan F-1. Black Allan was the foundation sire of the Tennessee Walking Horse breed and the sire of Roan Allen, who was owned by the Brantley family all his life. As a consequence of this family involvement, Charles Brantley was in contact with horses from a young age, and he began showing horses as a teenager. He competed in the inaugural Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration in 1939. Charles Brantley eventually took over his family's farm at Noah, Tennessee. Brantley owned a half interest in the notable breeding stallion and two-time World Grand Champion Midnight Sun when the horse was a colt; Midnight Sun later was sold to Harlinsdale Farm. Brantley specialized in breeding and showing his horses in hand, but he did train horses under saddle for a time. He was eventually forced to stop riding due to circulation problems, but continued to show horses in-hand until he had a knee replacement in 1982. At this time, trainer Chris Richards took over the job of showing Brantley's horses. When the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association created the Heritage Award in 1993, Brantley was the first recipient. The same year, he was given a certificate of appreciation for his contributions to the Tennessee Walking Horse National Museum. In 1999 he was inducted into the Tennessee Walking Horse Hall of Fame, and in 2002 the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame. The latter achievement made him the first person in the Tennessee Walking Horse industry to be so honored. By 2009, Charles Brantley had attended every Celebration, and had judged the ones his horses did not show in. Death Charles Brantley died July 22, 2016, at the age of 91.

He ruled the Sapadalaksha country, which included parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India. He defeated the Paramaras of Malwa, and also repulsed the Ghaznavid invasions after losing some part of his territory to them. The establishment of the Ajmer city is attributed to him.  Early life  Ajayaraja succeeded his father Prithviraja I on the Chahamana throne. He was also known as Salhana. The Prabandha Kosha and Hammira Mahakavya call him Alhana, which appears to be a variant of Salhana. He married Somalladevi, who is also known as Somaladevi, Somalekha or Somelekha.  Establishment of Ajmer  The 12th century text Prithviraja Vijaya states that Ajayaraja II established the city of Ajayameru (modern Ajmer). Historian Dasharatha Sharma notes that the earliest mention of the city's name occurs in Palha's Pattavali, which was copied in 1113 CE (1170 VS) at Dhara. This suggests that Ajmer was founded sometime before 1113 CE. A prashasti (eulogistic inscription) issued by Vigraharaja IV found at Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra states Ajayaraja II (Ajayadeva) moved his residence to Ajmer. The later text Prabandha-Kosha states that it was the 8th century king Ajayaraja I who commissioned the Ajayameru fort, which later came to be known as the Taragarh fort of Ajmer. According to historian R. B. Singh, Ajayaraja I probably founded the city, as inscriptions dated to 8th century CE have been found there. Singh theorizes that Ajayaraja II later enlarged the town, constructed palaces, and moved the Chahamana capital from Shakambhari to Ajmer.  Military career  = Paramaras = The Paramara dynasty of Malwa had been weakened because of invasions from the Gujarat Chaulukya king Jayasimha Siddharaja. Taking advantage of this, Ajayaraja seems to have expanded the Chahamana kingdom by capturing the Paramara territory. Ajayaraja defeated Sulhana (or Sollana), who was probably a commander of the Paramara king Naravarman According to the Bijolia rock inscription, Sulhana was a dandanayaka or general (the Prithviraja Vijaya names Sulhana as the king of Malwa, but there was no Paramara king by that name). The inscription states that Sulhana was captured in the battle, tied up to the back of a camel, and brought to the Chahamana capital Ajmer. An inscription found at Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra in Ajmer boasts that Ajayaraja conquered the territory up to Ujjain after defeating the ruler of Malwa. = Chachchiga, Simdhala and Yashoraja = The Bijolia rock inscription states that Ajayaraja killed three heroes named Chachchiga, Simdhala and Yashoraja, who were from Shrimarga-durdda. The identity of these rulers and localities are not certain, but these people were probably local chiefs who owed allegiance to a neighbouring king. Some scholars such as Akshay Kirti Vyas believe that Shrimarga and Durdda were two distinct localities. John Faithfull Fleet identified Shrimarga with modern Bayana. A. K. Vyas and R. B. Singh identified Durdda with modern Dudhai (in Madhya Pradesh) on the basis of similar-sounding names. These places are located to the east of the traditional Chahamana territory, which suggests that Ajayaraja made an attempt to expand the kingdom's boundaries eastwards. According to Singh, this theory is also corroborated by the discovery of his coins in Mathura. Historian Dasharatha Sharma disagrees with this theory. According to him, Bayana was not part of the Chahamana kingdom even in the late 12th century: it was controlled by the ruling dynasty of Tribhuvanagiri, who were ultimately defeated by Muhammad of Ghor. Similarly, the phonetic association of Dudhai with Durdda is not justified. This area was under Chandela control, and there is no evidence of Ajayaraja having conquered it. Had Ajayaraja conquered such distant territories by defeating the local dynasties, this achievement would have been mentioned in the Chahamana inscriptions and the Prithviraja Vijaya. Moreover, Bayana and Dudhai are two distinct, distant places; the Bijolia inscription suggests that the three chiefs came from one locality. According to Sharma, it is possible that durdda is an error for durga (\\"fort\\"). This means that these three chiefs were defenders of a fort named Shrimarga. The inscription states that Ajayaraja defeated the three chiefs before defeating the Malwa general. Sharma, therefore, theorized that Ajayaraja defeated the three warriors during his Malwa campaign. = Ghaznavids = The Prithviraja-Vijaya states that Ajayaraja defeated the Garjana Matangas (\\"Ghazna Muslims\\"). The Prabandha Kosha also claims that Ajayaraja defeated \\"Sahavadina\\" (Sanskritized form of Shahab-ud-Din). This probably refers to his repulsion of invasions by Ghaznavid generals. The 13th century Muslim historian Minhaj-i-Siraj states that the Ghaznavid ruler Bahram Shah made several expeditions to India during this time. According to Mihaj-i-Siraj's Tabaqat-i Nasiri and Firishta's Tarikh-i-Firishta, Muhammad Bahlim (Bahram Shah's governor in India) had captured the Nagaur fort. Nagaur was under Ajayaraja's control at least until 1121 CE, as attested by Prabhavaka Charita (the text calls him Alhadana, which appears to be a Sanskritized form of his alias Alhana). This suggests that Ajayaraja lost some of his territory to the Ghaznavids. After Bahlim died, Salar Hussain succeeded him as the governor of Ghaznavid territories in India. Ajayraja's victory over the Garjana Matangas was probably the repulsion of a raid by either Bahlim or Salar Hussain.  Last years  The prashasti found at the Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra states that Ajayaraja appointed his son Arnoraja as his successor. He then retired to the forest beside the Pushkar lake.  Religion  According to Prithviraja Vijaya, Ajayaraja was a devotee of Shiva. The Devasuri-Charita (in Prabhavaka Charita) suggests that he was also tolerant towards Vaishnavites and Jains. The Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali, a Sanskrit text containing biographies of the Kharatara Jain monks, indicates that he allowed Jains to build temples in his new capital Ajayameru (Ajmer). He also donated a golden kalasha to a Parshvanatha temple. Raviprabha Suri's Dharmaghosha-Stuti mentions that he was the judge of a debate between the Shvetambara monk Dharmaghosha Suri and the Digambara monk Gunachandra.  Coinage  Prithviraja Vijaya states that Ajayaraja \\"filled the earth\\" with so many silver coins (rupakas), that he took away the fame of other kings. An inscription at the Ruthi Rani temple at Dhod suggests that these coins were in use at least until the reign of his grandson Someshvara. Ajayaraja's silver coins have been found at many places, including Rajasthan and Mathura. These coins feature a seated goddess on one side, and the legend \\"Shri Ajayadeva\\" on the other side. The Prithviraja Vijaya also mentions that his consort Somelekha had new silver coins every day. Somelekha or Somalekha appears to be a variant of Somalladevi, which was the name of Ajayaraja's queen according to the Bijolia rock inscription. Some rare silver coins featuring a king's head and the legend \\"Shri Somaladevi\\" (or \\"Shri Somalladevi\\") in Nagari script have been discovered. Copper coins featuring the same legend with the image of a horseman have also been found. These are among the few coins issued by Indian queens.

Definition  According to Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission and World Meteorological Organization (WMO), \\"ODAS means a structure, platform, installation, buoy, or other device, not being a ship, together with its appurtenant equipment, deployed at sea essentially for the purpose of collecting, storing or transmitting samples or data relating to the marine environment or the atmosphere or the uses thereof.\\"  Use  Each hour, the data gathered by the system is transferred to the WMO's Global Telecommunications System by a geostationary satellite after having gone through a number of quality checks. Real-time data with information on the maritime environment can then be used for forecasts of physical states like weather, ocean currents or wave conditions which, in turn, may serve to warn seafarers of unfavourable conditions in the area.  ODAS types  ODAS buoy connected to the United States National Data Buoy Center ODAS can be mounted on the following structures: * Lighthouses * Lightvessels * Towers * Offshore platforms * Buoys ODAS buoys are not navigational aids but have been included into the IALA Maritime Buoyage System. The structures have a fixed geographical position.  Data  Data gathered by an ODAS may include the following parameters: * Air temperature * Atmospheric pressure at sea level * Wind direction * Wind speed including gusts * Sea state * Wave height * Sea surface temperature  Disadvantages  * ODAS buoys are expensive to obtain and need to be deployed by specialised vessels.

Five minutes north of this place, and over above the southern bank of the Kasimiyeh, which flows here in a deep ravine, I met with many ancient millstones, broken, and an ancient tomb cut in the rock, having the form of a simple grave, but covered with a great curved block of stone. Thirty minutes west of Bidias is the ruin called Khurbet ed Dar, on a hill overlooking the ravine. It consists of the interior of an enclosure formed of numerous stones roughly squared, with those of a few houses. At a short distance west of this place there are the ruins called Kh. el Meshatah, on a northern hill. They are those of an abandoned Mohammedan village, in which are older ruins, especially those of a building twenty-seven paces in length from west to east, the door of which is still standing. It is surmounted by a magnificent lintel, in the centre of which was once sculptured an ornament, now defaced, which occupied the middle of a sort of rectangular frame, terminating to right and left in the usual dove-tail. This building, which had been afterwards divided into several houses, was built of cut stones very regularly put together.\\"Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 251-253; as given in Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 56 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it as: \\"a village built of stone, on the top of a ridge, surrounded by olive trees and arable land.

Some were simple and made of wood, but the majority were built from stone or concrete blocks. They were once a common roadside sight in Britain in areas which carried out dairy farming, but collection of milk churns from stands ceased in Britain in 1979. Many have survived, some being renovated to memorialise the practice, while others have been dismantled or left to decay. Description Milk churn stand with steps Simple milk churn stand Milk churn stands could be made of wood, or were more permanent structures built from concrete or stone blocks. Many were simple cubic structures. Some had steps leading up to them, or just a foothole to reach the platform while some could be considerably more elaborate. The simple purpose of the stand was to facilitate collection of milk churns by cart or lorry and so were built at a convenient height for easy transfer. A conical churn weighing would weigh full. A later, standard, and lighter churn might contain , of milk, weighing about full. Once the full churns had been removed they were replaced by the haulier with empty ones for refilling by the next collection time. The full churns would then be transported directly by road to the dairy, or indirectly by rail. The origin of the milk churn stand probably dates back at least into the 19th century when commercial trade in milk became widespread, dairies became larger enterprises and widespread distribution was facilitated by rail and improving road networks. Cessation When in 1979 churn collection ceased and all milk was collected by tanker, the stands were no longer needed. Fate Forgotten milk churn stand A milk churn stand as a feature Many milk churn stands would have been lost during road improvement schemes owing to their proximity to the roadside but many were left in situ to slowly decay; thus there are few original wooden examples. However, many made from more durable materials such as concrete or stone have survived and can be seen throughout the country and, indeed, in other countries. Some have been renovated as reminders of the former widespread practice, while some replica stands have been erected for the same reason in stone (such as the example at Wadenhoe) and the reinstatement or removal of some has even been the subject of planning application. Some milk churn stands have been recorded as historical monuments by regional bodies and the National Archives.

In January 1919, he was elected a member of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, of which he became president in 1927. He also was a member of the Soci√©t√© Asiatique (1898, vice-president 1916‚Äì1926) and of the Acad√©mie des sciences coloniales, president of the Soci√©t√© de linguistique (1903‚Äì1904, 1918) and of the Soci√©t√© d'ethnographie.  Works  Favored by a good knowledge of European languages, the work of Cl√©ment Huart in the field of Arabic, Persian and Turkish studies were particularly appreciated in their time. According to his contemporaries, his personal preferences were in Arabic, and he knew Turkish better than Persian which he spoke with a Turkish accent.Jean Deny, in Cent-cinquantenaire de l'Ecole des langues orientales, Paris, 1948, (p. 29). Edward Granville Browne frequently mentioned him for his contributions to the study of Persian dialectology, linguistics and literary history, and noted in particular Huart's refusal to apply the term dari to Persian dialects which he rather included under the general heading of \\"Pahlavi Muslim\\" or \\"modern Median\\".A Year Amongst the Persians, London, 1893; repr., London, 1984, (p. 204‚Äì205); Lit. Hist. Persia I, (p. 26‚Äì27) His works, little or no reissued today, are still of some interest, although partly outdated. Many of his contributions to the first edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam were included in the second edition, sometimes revised and with a \\"further reading\\" section.  Bibliography  * H.

Orleans uses electronic and acoustic instruments (including synthesisers, guitar, violin, piano) to create a diverse and layered music. She performs as both a musician and DJ (the latter often under the alias Tract). Her work as a songwriter in many instances uses 1950s and 1960s pop as its basis, by way of everything from electronica to √âthiopiques (the CD series of 1960s and 1970s Ethiopian music), from Polish folk to Bernard Herrmann's film scores for Alfred Hitchcock. Orleans is based in Glasgow, after years in New York and Warsaw. Various independent labels around the world since 2008 have released her solo studio albums, as well as compilations, mixes and collaborations with artists such as Dirty Beaches, U.S. Girls and The Pastels. Orleans has scored music for TV, film, and opera. She has toured and made festival appearances across the UK, Europe and North America. She has played live and had her work presented internationally in galleries such as Tate Britain. Orleans describes her music as \\"movies for ears\\". She consistently receives international acclaim from the fringe, art and mainstream worlds. Q magazine acknowledges Ela Orleans' \\"prolific track record on the fringes of experimental music, both as a sound collagist and film composer\\" (May 2015). Uncut magazine has lauded Ela Orleans for her \\"beautifully confusing solo albums\\" (October 2013). The Wire magazine asserted that Orleans' \\"spectral pop enchants and disturbs, revealing new secrets with each listen\\" (September 2016). Thurston Moore in the Mojo magazine review of 2014 remarked on Ela Orleans' \\"astounding soundscapes, though it's her beautiful voice that really galvanises the music. ‚Ä¶ The best thing I've heard all year.\\" Other noted supporters of Orleans' music include DJ Andrew Weatherall, singer-songwriter Tim Burgess, director David Lynch, author Ian Rankin and indie group The Pastels.  Life and career  Ela Orleans graduated from the National College of Fine Arts in Bielsko- Biala, Poland, in 1991. She completed her master's degree at the Aleksander Zelwerowicz National Academy of Dramatic Art in Warsaw, in 1997. That same year, Orleans moved to Glasgow and, under the name Lizzy Swimmers, joined collage-pop group Hassle Hound. Ela Orleans returned to Warsaw in 2000. She continued to work with Hassle Hound, collaborated with German composer Marcus Schmickler and also began to create solo material. The UK indie Pickled Egg Records released Scaring the Grass in the Garden, the debut album from Hassle Hound, in 2002. The next year, experimental French label Textile Records released a split EP with Hassle Hound and the Australian duo Sun, comprising multi-instrumentalist Oren Ambarchi and composer Chris Townsend. Orleans moved to New York in 2004, where she played with experimental group Jackie-O Motherfucker, jazz drummer Kevin Shea, and collaborated with various noise artists. Twisted Nerve, the label founded by indie singer-songwriter Badly Drawn Boy and musician-DJ Andy Votel, that year issued \\"Appalachian Listening Post\\", a Hassle Hound single, and in 2006 the electronic music label Staubgold put out their second album, Limelight Cordial. Hassle Hound split up in 2008, and Orleans began to release her solo work. Italian indie Setola Di Maiale issued the debut Ela Orleans album, Low Sun, High Moon, and in 2009 France's La Station Radar put out the vinyl release Lost. This year also saw Ela Orleans win two mentorships. Orleans worked under the aegis of composer David Shire, known for soundtracks including The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation, and All the President's Men, after Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI), the United States performing rights organisation, chose her for its film scoring mentorship program. The New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) in addition paired Orleans with Viennese composer Lukas Ligeti after it selected her for its Immigrant Artist Mentoring Program. Ela Orleans began an ongoing collaboration in 2010 as composer for TVP1 and TVP Kultura, respectively the prime and arts channels of Poland's largest television network. A further Hassle Hound album, Born in a Night, also appeared this year. Double Feature, a split album with electro-rockabilly artist Dirty Beaches (real name Alex Zhang Hungtai), came out in 2011 (on Night People in the US and La Station Radar in France), as did the third full Ela Orleans album, Mars Is Heaven (jointly released by the French labels La Station Radar and Atelier Ciseaux), and NEO PI-R, a compilation of four-track recordings on Clan Destine Records. The Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA) included the Ela Orleans piece \\"Amsler Grid\\" in its exhibition An Exchange with Sol LeWitt, a celebration of the conceptual artist LeWitt's creative relationships. This year also saw Orleans move back to Glasgow, and the next saw the release of Statement, a split album with Dirty Beaches, art-rock performer Slim Twig (real name Max Turnbull) and the indie-electronica group based around Meghan Remy, U.S. Girls. Orleans in addition released 80 Minutes of Funk in 2012, a split cassette with Curt Crackrach (n√©e Dafydd McKaharay, a fellow proponent of the so-called \\"witch house\\" or horror-film/occult electronica music genre). Orleans also collaborated on several occasions with Skitter (real name Liam Stefani and described by Rough Trade as a \\"one-man noise puzzlist\\") on drone soundscapes, which culminated in 2013's De fl√©chettes. The song \\"Light in Extension\\", released under the name Tract, an experimental acid-techno alter ego of Ela Orleans, appeared on the Clan Destine compilation Dark Acid III. Ela Orleans' double album Tumult in Clouds meanwhile beat nominees including Hookworms, Broadcast and My Bloody Valentine to win the Mercury Prize alternative, the inaugural Dead Albatross Music Prize. Orleans remixed \\"Kalimba\\" (originally from the Brian Eno album Music for Films III on the All Saints label) by ambient musician Laraaji in 2014, as part of a Warp Records project to revive the All Saints catalogue. Swedish director-artist Maja Borg together with Dazed & Confused, meanwhile, produced Borg's short film We the Others and commissioned Orleans to provide the soundtrack. Orleans also took up residency at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'art de Bourges, France, to score a soundtrack for Architecture of an Atom, a feature film directed by cartoonist-filmmaker Juliacks (real name Julia Stein) and screened in various international contemporary art museums. Orleans undertook a further residency at the Warsaw Chamber Opera theatre to compose the music for Wieza (Tower), an opera directed by artist Karolina Bregula and commissioned by the Polish foundation Witryna Kultury. Howie B (full name Howard Bernstein) produced the next Ela Orleans album, Upper Hell, and released it on his HB Records label in 2015. Orleans also accepted a commission from the Glasgow Women's Library to score the feature-length documentary March, by Royal Conservatoire of Scotland lecturer Anna Birch and editor Marissa Keating. Orleans subsequently took an artist-in-residence position at the Elektronmusikstudion (EMS, or Electroacoustic Music in Sweden), the national centre for Swedish electroacoustic music and sound-art based in Stockholm, to complete a commission for the soundtrack to Man, another Maja Borg film. Bristol band Spectres released a duet between frontman Joe Hatt and Ela Orleans, \\"Spectre\\", as an unofficial theme song for the James Bond film Spectre and rival to \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" by Sam Smith. The Glasgow Film Festival appointed Ela Orleans in 2016 to write and perform a score for the 1929 silent film Lucky Star, directed by Frank Borzage. The Glasgow International Festival in turn commissioned Orleans to write a score for the classic 1932 film Vampyr, directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer. The original, unexpurgated vision of Upper Hell appeared as the double album Circles of Upper and Lower Hell (on Glasgow's Night School Records), and Orleans was again nominated for the Dead Albatross Music Prize. The album featured lyrics taken from Arthur Rimbaud, Dante's Divine Comedy and an early 20th-century poem by Sara Teasdale. Stephen Pastel (Stephen McRobbie) and Katrina Mitchell of The Pastels contributed vocals to the song \\"You Go Through Me\\".

(also often referred by its brand names Finagraph or BBC Easy) is a provider of automation tools and business intelligence software for small business accounting. The company was founded in 2011 by a former Microsoft employee James Walter and a former vice-president of Bank of America, Corey Ross. The synergy produced BBC Easy and Finagraph ‚Äî two technological solutions for small business that offer strategic financial intelligence and streamline obtaining business loans. After Moody's acquisition of the stake in Booyami in May 2016, Booyami announced that it now intends to expand its Finagraph service to medium-size businesses.  History  Booyami Inc. was founded in March 2011 by two former Seattle area executives, James Walter and Corey Ross. With seven years experience working on Xbox and Windows 7 at Microsoft, James came from the IT world, while Corey, who held titles of vice- president in Banner Bank and in Bank of America, came from the world of banking. Together, they conceived its first product ‚Äî ‚Ä≥BBC Easy‚Ä≥ aimed to automate borrowing base certificate processing for small businesses. By the end of 2011, the company raised over $900,000 of venture capital towards patenting their ideas and towards the new hires needed for the product development. BBC Easy cloud application was launched in November 2012. In April 2013, the first financial institution, Numerica Credit Union, successfully integrated the product into its C&I; loan system. At the same time Booyami started its second product, Finagraph, designed to assess small businesses for loan eligibility. In 2013 Booyami intended to raise $1 million for the product development, but managed to raise only $195,000. Nevertheless, Finagraph was successfully developed. In 2014, Finagraph was among 20 finalists (out of 870 participants) of Forbes' New Banking and Digital Life Open Talent event. Booyami initially planned to sell Finagraph to small businesses, but changed their business model, offering Finagraph to small business for free, making money of banks and large accounting firms. Selling Finagraph to US banks was aggravated by \\"the steep regulations in the industry,\\" and Booyami searched for alternative ways to promote and distribute the product. In September 2014, Booyami raised additional $1.25 million to acquire a 15-year-old Seattle BBI Financial Academy. Booyami re-branded it as \\"Finagraph Academy\\" and incorporated Finagraph in its training courses. In October 2015, Puget Sound Business Journal has listed Booyami in the top ten Big Data companies of Puget Sound Area. In May 2016, Moody's purchased a stake in Booyami. The companies announced plans to integrate Finagraph with existing Moody's analytics tools and further developing Finagraph to service medium- sized businesses.  Products and Services  = BBC Easy = right BBC Easy (stands for ‚Ä≥Borrowing Base Certificates made Easy‚Ä≥) is a cloud application that streamlines processing of small business loans. In order to get a loan approval, a small business needs to certify is borrowing base ‚Äî a metric of the value of its assets, so the lender can determine the size of the loan that can be offered. However, the time required of a loan officer to underwrite a small loan is comparable to the time needed to underwrite a substantial loan which reduces banks' propensity to deal with small borrowers. BBC Easy simplifies underwriting by generating required forms and reports directly from borrower's accounting system, thus reducing errors, fraud, and in turn, lenders' risks. BBC Easy turns traditional borrowing base certificate submission into a single click. After the application launch in November 2012, Booyami focused on credit unions as the primary market for BBC sales. Numerica Credit Union in Spokane, Washington was the first bank that adopted BBC Easy. = Finagraph = right Finagraph is a business intelligence application which analyzes current and historical accounting data of a small business, offers strategical financial advice, and provides business owners with an overview of their business from banks' perspective, including relevant financial comparisons with similar organizations within the same industry. Finagraph is compatible with major accounting software (such as QuickBooks, Xero, etc.) and does not require any separate data entry. Instead, Finagraph ‚Ä≥replaces hours of work with 1-click.‚Ä≥ Furthermore, Finagraph can perform certain functions of BBC Easy by assembling relevant accounting data and generating forms required for a loan application. Finagraph is currently offered to clients for free, as Booyami seeks to make money of Finagraph licences sold to financial institutions. In the effort of disseminating Finagraph, Booyami has purchased BBI Financial Academy and modified its curriculum around Finagraph. Finagraph also supports complex accounting of crowdfunding ventures. In 2014, Finagraph application was recognized by Forbes as New Banking and Digital Life finalist. After Moody's investment into Booyami in 2016, Booyami announced its intention to expand Finagraph to medium-size businesses market and to feature Finagraph with credit score information based on Moody's Analytics Risk Quality (MARQ) system. = Finagraph Academy = Formerly BBI Financial Academy, Finagraph Academy founded in 1990 provides financial education and consulting to business owners and accountants.

History In 1997, the then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan Syed Sajjad Ali Shah took suo-moto notice and asked for suggestions for curbing terrorism. A high level delegation of Tehreek e Nifaz e Fiqah Jafariya (TNFJ) led by the then Vice President Allama Taajud Din Haidery met with the Ali Shah on 21August1997 and presented its anti-terrorism/peace formula, recommended by TNFJ chief Agha Syed Hamid Ali Shah Moosavi. Almost all the steps recommended in the formula were adopted by the Government of Pakistan‚Äôs anti-terrorism policies. Plans such as National Internal Security Policy (NISP2014-2018) and the National Action Plan (Pakistan) (NAP) are among the examples. Moosavi Peace Formula also received significant amount of coverage and discussion mostly in the national print media including Daily Jang and Daily Nawa-e-Waqt of 22August while Daily Dawn of 23August1997 besides others. The Moosavi Peace Formula included a detailed account of the origins and root causes of terrorism. It also presented a detailed strategy and steps required to eradicate terrorism from Pakistan. This formula was presented to the Supreme Court by TNFJ leaders Allama Taj-ud-Din Haideri, Syed Mazhar ALi Shah Advocate, Syed Shujaat Ali Bukhari, Allama Qamar Zaidi and Allama Saqlain Bukhari. Major points =Root causes= *International Colonial Powers' fear related to Pakistan which leads them punishing Pakistan. *India never accepted the existence of Pakistan and takes advantage of incidents occurring in occupied Kashmir. *Activities of foreign secret agencies *Distraction from the national issues, specifically the nuclear capability and Kashmir issue *Illegal settlement of foreigners *Different sections occupied by elements representing feudalism and dictatorship. *Flourishing cultures of Ignorance, illiteracy, unemployment, Kalashnikov and drugs heroin *Sectarian and linguistic groups finding shelter in government and opposition parties. *Basing electoral politics on sectarian or linguistic discrimination. *Media coverage of the religious and language extremists. *Foreign funding of religious and political parties *Appointments of incompetent people in civil administration. *Confrontation between government and opposition. *Hypocritical policies of politicians. =Key Recommendations= *Government must avoid begging from international colonial powers. *Pakistan‚Äôs founding ideology must be presented to explain that Islam is a complete code of life, it ensures protection of human rights for all sections including minorities while considers all kinds of oppression as major sin. *Government trying to have friendly relations with India, must demand from India to stop intervening in Pakistan and resolve the issue of Kashmir in accordance with the wishes of Kashmiris and United Nations resolutions. *Government of Pakistan must protest to the home governments of the foreign agencies involved in creating unrest in Pakistan. *Government must clarify to the world that Pakistan‚Äôs nuclear capability is aimed at strengthening Pakistan, while the issue of Kashmir is not only a problem of Pakistan but the entire Muslim Ummah therefore, Islamic world must pay attention to Kashmir issue. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) must be informed that Pakistan is being illegitimately punished on this issue and that the Islamic world must urge India in this regard. Government and opposition must adopt a joint strategy on Kashmir issue. *Illegally settled foreigners must be deported to their homelands. *Elements representing feudalism and dictatorship must be expelled from electoral politics for ten years. *Bold and practical steps must be taken to resolve core issues including poverty, unemployment and insecurity. *Government and opposition must demonstrate courage and separate themselves from the religio-political and sectarian groups participating in electoral politics. *Government must ban participating in electoral politics on religious, sectarian or linguistic basis as it is devastating for the country. An anti-sectarian bill declare that Sunni and Shia are the established sects of Islam and calling any of them non-Muslim or attacking their worship places must be considered as an attack on Islam (Sha‚Äôair e Islam) and treatef as a crime deserving punishment. Furthermore, all schools of thought must act in accordance with their ideologies and must not intervene in one another. *Electronic and Print media must stop offering media coverage to extremist elements so that such elements can be discouraged. *Foreign funding to religious and political parties operating in Pakistan must be protested against at diplomatic fronts. The Government must investigate how exactly some elements shifted overnight from extreme poverty to excessive richness. In this regard, Tehreek e Nifaz e Fiqah Jafariya (TNFJ) voluntarily presents itself for audit. *Civil administration must be purified: justice and fair play must prevail. *Government and Opposition must operate within their boundaries and demonstrate courage to respect and tolerate each other. *Rulers and politicians must avoid hypocrisy. People of Pakistan must rely upon Almighty Allah only and condemn extremist and terrorist groups. =Hate material= The government banned several religious books, however the ban was mainly imposed based on complaints received against any book and law enforcement lacked a proper justification to declare a violation of the hate material law. MPV also proposed comprehensive criteria and well-defined guidelines to declare any script as a violation. Guidelines and recommendations presented in this regard include: *Fundamental books of any sect (including the Quran‚Äôs translations and interpretations) must be exempted from the ban. *Books that mention the sayings and quotes of Mohammed and his Ahl-e-Bait must not be banned. *Basic books of history such as Hayat ul Qaloob, Jilaa ul Ayoon, Anwar un Nomaniya must not be banned. *Books written before partition must not be banned to avoid sectarian rifts. *Any book written in response to another book must not be banned without banning the book to which it responds. *Books written after 1977 to aggravate sectarianism can be banned. However, banning books that were written centuries ago cannot be justified. *Punishment for the crime of disrespecting Mohamed should be permanent. *In Fiqah Jafariya, the punishment of disrespecting Ahl-e-Bait is the death penalty. *Some groups demanded to impose the death penalty. However, none of the courts during the eras of Mohamed or his companions announced death punishment for such cases.

Biography McClintock was born in Klamath Falls, Oregon, to in 1930 and Eletha (Humphrey) McClintock and Robert McClintock. He grew up in Seattle, Washington, and joined the Merchant Marine in 1946. Three years later, he settled in San Francisco, where he took art classes at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute). Among his teachers were Richard Diebenkorn, Edward Corbett, and James Budd Dixon. He developed his skill as a printmaker working as Dixon's assistant. At one point he shared a studio in the city with Ernest Briggs. During the Korean War, McClintock served as an illustrator and instructor in the U.S. Army and was afterwards stationed in Alaska (1953‚Äì55). On his return to San Francisco, he became the co-owner of a commercial photoengraving business. In the 1980s, he left that business and got a job with the San Francisco Maritime Museum, where he had previously been a volunteer. McClintock moved to Portland, Oregon, in 1997. Artwork Although he has made a number of paintings, McClintock is best known for his prints, which range from lithographs to drypoint etchings and mezzotints. Highly abstract, with an atmospheric use of color, they yet offer \\"intimations of landscape\\". His work was included the Museum of Modern Art (New York)'s 1954 survey, \\"American Prints of the 20th Century,\\" at which time he was credited, along with Will Barnet and Ralston Crawford, with helping to bring color lithography in America to a par with work being done in Europe. His work is in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art (New York), and the Library of Congress, among others.

Intuitively, if e is the shortness exponent of a graph family {\\\\mathcal F}, then every n-vertex graph in the family has a cycle of length near n^e but some graphs do not have longer cycles. More precisely, for any ordering of the graphs in {\\\\mathcal F} into a sequence G_0, G_1, \\\\dots, with h(G) defined to be the length of the longest cycle in graph G, the shortness exponent is defined as. :\\\\liminf_{i\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\log h(G_i)}{\\\\log V(G_i)}. This number is always in the interval from 0 to 1; it is 1 for families of graphs that always contain a Hamiltonian or near-Hamiltonian cycle, and 0 for families of graphs in which the longest cycle length can be smaller than any constant power of the number of vertices. The shortness exponent of the polyhedral graphs is \\\\log_3 2\\\\approx 0.631. A construction based on kleetopes shows that some polyhedral graphs have longest cycle length O(n^{\\\\log_3 2}),. while it has also been proven that every polyhedral graph contains a cycle of length \\\\Omega(n^{\\\\log_3 2}).. The polyhedral graphs are the graphs that are simultaneously planar and 3-vertex-connected; the assumption of 3-vertex- connectivity is necessary for these results, as there exist sets of 2-vertex- connected planar graphs (such as the complete bipartite graphs K_{2,n}) with shortness exponent 0. There are many additional known results on shortness exponents of restricted subclasses of planar and polyhedral graphs. The 3-vertex-connected cubic graphs (without the restriction that they be planar) also have a shortness exponent that has been proven to lie strictly between 0 and 1...

History The ancient Romans imposed a tributum capitis (poll tax) as one of the principal direct taxes on the peoples of the Roman provinces.Digest 50, tit.15 In the Republican period, poll taxes were principally collected by private tax farmers (publicani), but from the time of Emperor Augustus, the collections were gradually transferred to magistrates and the senates of provincial cities. The Roman census was conducted periodically in the provinces to draw up and update the poll tax register. The Roman poll tax fell principally on Roman subjects in the provinces, but not on Roman citizens. Towns in the provinces who possessed the Jus Italicum (enjoying the \\"privileges of Italy\\") were exempted from the poll tax. The 212 edict of Emperor Caracalla which formally conferred Roman citizenship on all residents of Roman provinces, did not however exempt them from the poll tax. The Roman poll tax was deeply resented - Tertullian bewailed the poll tax as a \\"badge of slavery\\" - and it provoked numerous revolts in the provinces. Perhaps most famous is the Zealot revolt in Judaea of 66 AD. After the destruction of the temple in 70 AD, the Emperor imposed an extra poll tax on Jews throughout the empire, the fiscus judaicus, of two denarii each. The Italian revolt of the 720s, organized and led by Pope Gregory II, was originally provoked by the attempt of the Constantinople Emperor Leo III the Isaurian to introduce a poll tax in the Italian provinces of the Byzantine Empire in 722, and set in motion the permanent separation of Italy from the Byzantine empire. When King Aistulf of the Lombards availed himself of the Italian dissent and invaded the Exarchate of Ravenna in 751, one of his first acts was to institute a crushing poll tax of one gold solidus per head on every Roman citizen. Seeking relief from this burden, Pope Stephen II appealed to Pepin the Short of the Franks for assistance, that led to the establishment of the Papal States in 756.

Overview The solar farm sits on and consist of 200,200 solar panels and is expected to be the largest in East and Central Africa. It is expected to create about 1,000 jobs during the construction period. The power from this power station is enough to power about 625,000 homes. The power station is owned and operated by Kenya Rural Electrification Authority, a government agency. The power generated will be sold to Kenya Power and Lighting for integration into the national grid. In February 2018, the Business Daily Africa, reported that the expected commissioning of this power plant had been pushed back to December 2018, following delays. The solar park sells electricity wholesale to Kenya Power at Sh5.49 per unit. The power purchase agreement, signed in September 2016, calls for Kenya Power to sell electricity from the solar plant at KSh12 (US$0.12) per kilowatt hour, approximately KSh8 cheaper than diesel-generated electricity. Construction timeline, costs, and funding China Jiangxi, a Chinese construction company was awarded the construction contract at a budgeted cost of KSh13.7 billion ($135.7 million), borrowed from Exim Bank of China. Construction was expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2016 and was expected to last one year. Due to prolonged negotiations in securing a power purchase agreement from Kenya Power and Lighting, construction of this project was delayed. As of February 2018, commissioning of the power station was expected in December 2018.

The settlement was first called \\"Mound Place\\", and then \\"Priddy\\", before being renamed Roseacres. History In 1844, James L. Alcorn established a cotton plantation here called \\"Mound Place\\". He also opened a law office in nearby Friars Point. Alcorn would later become Governor of Mississippi. Mound Place had a post office from 1854-71. In 1863, during the American Civil War, forces of the Union Army were desperate to capture Vicksburg, located about south on the Mississippi River. The Yazoo Pass Expedition sent Union gunboats into Yazoo Pass, which flowed next to Mound Place, in an attempt to follow a circuitous route of waterways down to Vicksburg. Union forces progressed as far as Greenwood, where a Confederate steamer was scuttled to block their progress. During the weeks when Union ships were passing Mound Place, first on their advance and then on their retreat, Mound Place was used as a temporary camp by Union soldiers. It was reported that the soldiers slaughtered Alcorn's cattle to feed their troops, rolled his carriages into Yazoo Pass, and destroyed his fences. The Mobile and Northwestern Railroad was laid in the 1870s, and a station was established at Mound Placed called \\"Priddy\\". The line was abandoned in 1983. An outbreak of smallpox occurred at Roseacres in 1882, with 20 cases noted and five deaths. The United States Nursery Company purchased the plantation in 1910, and the settlement was renamed \\"Roseacres\\".

In the book, Ashton debunks many common myths about creativity and proposes that hard work, rather than creative genius, is the true source of innovation. Reception Ben East of The Observer wrote, \\"[Ashton's] well chosen examples reinforce the idea that there is no magic or myth to creation or discovery, making this an approachable, thought-provoking book that encourages everyone to be the best they can be.\\" Christine Sismondo of the Toronto Star similarly observed, \\"Creation isn't magic. Though the subtitle of How to Fly a Horse promises a 'secret history' of creation, the secret is, essentially, that there is no secret. Creativity is the result of hard work, learning the foundations and getting better at problem-solving. That's bad news for those hoping a bump on the head will lead to the design for the flux capacitor that transforms the DeLorean into a time machine. It's good news, however, for everyone else, since it means that creativity is accessible to anyone.\\" The book was also praised by Amanda Erickson of The Washington Post, who nevertheless wrote, \\"At times, Ashton's book feels like a self-help guide, weighed down with trite insights and sayings that could just as well appear on your HR rep's calendar. Take this smattering, all from a single page: 'Everything arises from steps, not leaps.' 'Creation is execution, not inspiration.' 'Ideas are like deeds; they are abundant, and most of them never grow into anything.' Still, I found it reassuring to know that Mozart struggled with his compositions, toiling over them for weeks. Einstein worked for years on his most famous theory. And Kandinsky labored for five months to plan his apparently spontaneous painting, drawing 20 almost identical sketches.\\" The book was criticized by David Annand of The Daily Telegraph, however, who wrote, \\"According to its dust jacket, How To Fly a Horse belongs to a recently created genre called 'Smart Thinking', a post-Gladwellian classification, much of which is concerned with reducing complex socio- economic phenomena into platitudes that can be delivered at dinner parties. It seems to be elastic enough to include writers such as Daniel Kahneman and soi- disant corporate gurus who wrap their anecdotes in a motivational framework exhorting you to power up your confidence and pursue your dreams.\\" Despite describing the book's anecdotes as \\"rather lovely,\\" Annand concluded, \\"All told, I suspect there is actually only one thing that connects history's innovative geniuses: their library shelves are entirely empty of 'Smart Thinking'.\\" References Category:2015 non-fiction books Category:Books about creativity Category:Self-help books Category:Doubleday (publisher) books ","title":"How to Fly a Horse"},{"id":"51797228","text":"Stratified slope deposits or gr√®zes lit√©es (original French name) are accumulations of debris that are traditionally associated with periglaciation but that can also form in other settings. The deposits have a weak sorting and a coarse bedding. Stratified slope deposits are usually found at the lower slopes of valleys where thicknesses vary but may exceed 10 meters. Periglacial stratified slope deposits are thought to be the result of rock fragmented by frost being accumulated downslope. A distinction can be made between stratified slope deposits formed in screes and those of gr√®zes lit√©es type. The first ones form in slopes with angles in excess of 30¬∞, the latter ones in slopes with angles of 30‚Äì28¬∞ or as low as 5¬∞. The gr√®zes lit√©es type has been reported from Mediterranean mountains, Atlantic Europe, Central Europe, Himalaya, the Dry Andes and the Tropical Andes. The best exposure north of the Alps is in Enscherange in Luxembourg. There are relatively few reports of gr√®zes lit√©es in the High Arctic, nevertheless these include Svalbard, Western Greenland and Southern Banks Island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Early concept evolution Stratified slope deposits were first reported under the name of gr√®zes lit√©es in Charente, France, in 1951. A few years later Andr√© Cailleux described similar deposits calling them √©boulis ordonn√©s. Subsequently, Jan Dylik described occurrences in central Poland in the 1960s. In 1968 Jean Tricart argued further for a periglacial origin of gr√®zes lit√©es. While French scientists gave the term gr√®zes lit√©es a constrained definition by attributing them to a frost weathering origin and characterizing them granumetrically, its usage by non-French expanded the concept beyond this early definition. Processes of formation Periglacial stratified slope deposits form typically in periglacial areas that lack permafrost. Pleistocene-aged stratified slope deposits formed from stone-banked solifluction lobes. In the Andes the depth of freezing associated with the formation of stratified slope deposit is estimated at less than 15 cm while in Charente it is 40 to 50 cm. A major process that forms stratified slope deposits in periglacial areas is solifluction of stone blankets in the form of solifluction lobes and sheets. Other processes include rock fall, flow of ice- coasted clasts, flow of dry grains, debris flow and snow avalanches. Other processes that contribute to the formation, but that are of lesser importance, include overland flow of water caused by rain and the combined action of snow and wind. Stratified slope deposits can form in non-periglacial environments, meaning that the presence of stratified slope deposit is not unequivocal evidence for past periglaciation. The reason for the occurrence of stratified slope deposits outside present or past periglacial areas is that many of the processes that lead to their formation are azonal.

The catastrophe was partially caused by the mining of slate, beginning after 1870, by impoverished farmers who sought an additional source of income. Being inexperienced with proper mining techniques, they destabilized the rock face until the final catastrophe. The miners undercut the mountain face to a breadth of 180 m, and already in 1878 first rock movements occurred. A geological commission to examine the increasing number of rockfalls visited the scene shortly before the catastrophe, but did not find any indications of an impending disaster. The loud noise of the rockfalls, break-offs and fractures were already heard during the Sunday service on the morning of September 11, 1881. In spite of this, next to nobody left the dangerous area ‚Äì in fact, many spectators went to the affected area or climbed to the nearby hamlet D√ºniberg on the opposing face of the valley in the hope of enjoying a better view of the spectacle. In the late afternoon, after two smaller rock slides, 10 million cubic meters (353 million cubic feet) of slate broke off, travelled 2 km (1.24 miles), and destroyed 90 hectares (222.4 acres) of land.

It was released for iOS platforms on January 26, 2011 and was formerly on Google Play for Android. Zombie Cafe is a game in which players run a caf√© by cooking dishes and serving customers with the help of zombies. The in-game currency is Cash and the special currency is Toxin. Players can infect customers into zombies, becoming your indefinite employees. Players gain experience by cooking and serving dishes. There are a variety of menu items, each differing in price, number of servings, XP, and time to cook. As the restaurant builds up savings, the player can purchase more recipes, better furnishings, fancy novelties, and can infect more customers. The player can also purchase pets and expand their restaurant. Along with growing your business, players can send their zombies to raid enemy caf√©s to obtain or unlock new recipes. Players can add friends on Game Center to order food, collect fees, share recipes, and raid each other. Players can also connect to Facebook to form a franchise with their Facebook friends. Zombie Cafe had received positive reviews since its release. Gameplay The waitstaff in the restaurant is made up entirely of zombies. The restaurant's customers can be transformed into zombie slaves to serve food and take up dirty plates, but players must not overwork their zombies. If their Energy levels get too low, they will start attacking customers, lowering the caf√© rating. A low-Energy zombie must be sent to rest for a period, or the player can instantly replenish the zombie's Energy with Toxin. =Dishes= Dishes are the main source of income in Zombie Cafe. Each dish varies between cook time, cost, number of servings, and amount of XP given. A stove is required to prepare and cook all dishes. While cooking, the player first spends money on the dish then they are required to wait a certain amount of time before serving it to the customers. Dishes can also be looted during raids for free, and new recipes can be unlocked if the player has not yet unlocked them. You can cook a previously unlocked dish if you have enough money and an open stove. The dish requires a chef or zombie to be cooked but it can be paused and resumed at any time. Depending on the dish's cook time, if the player leaves a stove unattended for a long enough time or ignores it after it is finished cooking, it will burn. Once a dish has finished cooking, you can leave it unattended for a period of time depending on the recipe cook time. To serve a dish after it has completed its cook time, the player can select his or her zombies or chef to serve by clicking/tapping on a serving counter, sink, or table. Servers will automatically take dishes to waiting customers and clear dirty dishes. They will need a clear path to every table, serving counter, and sink. If not, the zombies or chef will remain motionless. Cooking is the best way to gain XP and level up a player's caf√©. As a caf√© levels up, the player can unlock new dishes that are found in The General Cookbook, with a total of 97 dishes. The highest level dish you can unlock is Yucky-soba (at level 100). There are 320 recipes the player can cook in 21 different cookbooks and over 100 recipes from raids can be unlocked, including 34 rare ones. Many require special stoves to cook on. These stoves can be purchased in the store in the Utility section for Cash and can be upgraded by spending Toxin. The second way to acquire a dish is by raiding an enemy cafe on the map. When raiding, there will be a random food dish on the counter. When the zombies win, it will be stolen then the food will appear in one of your fridges. From there, you can either serve the dish for the customers or unlock it as a cookable item. If a dish or recipe has already been unlocked, the only option left is to serve it. There are 9 different dish variations: Spicy, Very Spicy, Fancy, Very Fancy, Bulk, Fresh, Frozen, Quick, and Very Quick. These rare and special variations are more valuable than their normal counterparts. Each can be unlocked through enemy raid caf√©s or through a friend's caf√© (if already unlocked by the player's friends). =Customers= Customers are the people who consume the dishes and give money to the player. There are many types of customers with varying appearance, gender and occupation. Not only can customers come as pure human, they can also appear as supernatural beings such as mummies, vampires, aliens, superheros, deities, and some based on legendary creatures. Some characters in the game are based on living persons. The Japanese version has characters from the Mega Man series. Each customer that visit the caf√© will depend on the player's level and the caf√©'s current rating, as can be viewed in the Zombiepedia. Every customer has a \\"zombie form\\", so the player can infect any patron they want into a zombie to work for the chef. The ones first encountered (from the tutorial) are usually free. Later on, newer customers will appear with varying prices, some with coins but most with Toxin. The player can view a customer's attributes (e.g. Energy, Tip Rating, Speed, Atk. Strength) by clicking/tapping on the Info button on the lower right hand corner after the player clicks/taps on the customer. All customers have different stats; Energy ranges between 50 and 1250; Tip Rating, Speed and Atk. Strength ranges between 1 and 12. Customers with higher stats are more expensive, topping at 80 Toxin the most. (See below for more.) =Raids= There's more than just growing your business by cooking and serving; players can also send their zombies on a raid. They can steal food and unlock new recipes if successful. New recipes will then end up in the player's fridge from which they can either serve it or unlock it. To defeat a caf√©, the zombies must defeat the raid boss. Players can also have their zombies retreat by clicking/tapping on a white flag icon on the upper left hand corner. If unsuccessful (all zombies get killed), the player does not receive the recipe but can receive Cash if the zombies eat the customers or employees. Toxin can be acquired albeit rarely. Players can also invite their friends to raid each other. The higher Energy and Atk. Strength zombies have, the better outcome of winning raids. Players can purchase Spcial Tombstones in the store for Toxin to alter zombie stats (making them stronger) or heal them. Some zombies, like Little Red, Huntsman and Granny Wolf, can turn into the Big Bad Wolf to easily defeat raids as they become invinsible and much more powerful in the process. The five robot pets (namely Midnight Panther, Royal Bear, Rage Bull, Golden Lion, Fiery Hound) can assemble into Amtron, a powerful bipedal composite robot, which can easily wreak havoc in enemy caf√©s. Players can even summon the Zombie Yeti (after purchasing as a Tombstone for 75 Toxin) and a maximum of three can be summoned at once. =Caf√© rating= The caf√© rating shows the reputation of the player's caf√©, indicated by stars on the upper left hand corner. The higher a caf√©'s rating, the more popular a caf√© becomes. This way more customers will appear. When customers finish their food and give you money, thought bubbles appear above their heads to indicate their feelings about the service. Happy yellow faces increase ratings and frowning blue faces decrease ratings. By making customers happy, the star rating will increase and more customers will show up, giving the chef more cash. If customers aren't satisfied or are attacked by an Energy-deprived zombie, the caf√© rating will drop, affecting its popularity thus less customers will appear. A caf√© should have enough seats and number of dishes to accommodate customers. Depending on the size of the caf√©, the player may need more seats, more utilities, and more zombie servers to speed up the serving process. Certain items from the store will grant your caf√© a rating bonus. Green blinking stars indicate that a caf√© rating had just gone up during a player's absence and red blinking stars indicate that the caf√© rating is now lower than it used to be. There is a feature from Zombie Cafe which functions similar to reviews. It becomes available when the player's caf√© reaches level 6. By completing four tasks in the \\"to do\\" list, the chef's caf√© rating will gain a purple bonus star. Up to three bonus stars can be obtained, and they will only drop with the pass of time. The tasks are selected randomly from either raiding, serving, cooking, spending money on your caf√©, collecting fees from friends. If the player has friends playing the game, the tasks will shift towards doing business involving their friends. After completing the four objectives, the player will gain one bonus star and a review will be shown. The player can also bribe the reviewer to complete the tasks by using 2 Toxin for each incomplete objective. The purple stars last temporarily, maxing out at 3 stars. Tip Rating and Speed ensures higher caf√© rating. Higher base-Energy can be important as zombies will take longer to attack a customer. =Store= The store is where the player can buy new content for the caf√©. It is divided in seven sections: Featured, Decor, Utility, Furniture, Walls/Floors, Special, and Storage. The Featured section shows the most notable content or recent additions to the shop; Decor contains floor decorations; Utility contains important kitchen utilities such as a stove, fridge, counter, sink; Furniture contains chairs and tables for the clients; Walls/Floors includes different wallpapers, floor tiles, windows and decorative wall objects; and Special contains miscellaneous content such as outdoor decoration (e.g. [Special] Tombstones, Pets), caf√© expansion, any item that generates in-game money (e.g. ATM, Vending Machine), and any item that costs real money (e.g. Toxin Generator, Super Booster). The Storage section displays the items you‚Äôve stored, which is unlimited. (The Storage section also appears as a brown box icon on the lower right hand corner.) You can store all bought content from the shop after a certain level. Items can be sold for 50% of their original price. Flooring and wallpaper in Walls/Floors cannot be stored, sold nor refunded if replaced. Tombstones can be stored but cannot be sold. It is known as the shop („Ç∑„Éß„ÉÉ„Éó shoppu) in the Japanese version. =Zombiepedia= The Zombiepedia is a book containing a list of zombies, showing details of every zombie in the game, similar to the Almanac Entry from the Plants vs. Zombies series. It was added in the 1.3.6 update and is located on the right side of the game screen. Currently the Zombiepedia contains 225 zombies. It shows all the zombies' Energy, Tip Rating, Speed, Atk. Strength, price, the caf√© rating requirement, and the player level requirement. The Zombiepdia is divided in three sections: Featured (displays the most recently added zombies), Themed (showing zombies that represent their respective themes) and All (all 225 zombies). In the Japanese version, there is an alternative to the Zombiepedia called Zombie Collection ( Zonbi Korekushon). However, it lacks the \\"themed\\" organization of the International version and doesn't give a full view of the zombies per page due to having over 1000 zombies available. The Zombie Collection also allows players to see the uninfected customer versions of acquired zombies, unlike in the Zombiepedia where it only shows the undead versions. =Meat Locker= The Meat Locker is used by the player to keep zombies that aren't in use so they aren't lost due to the limit of zombies working in the caf√©. (The maximum is 14 and there are 225 zombies in the game.) It was added in the 1.2.7 update. The Meat Locker contains five hooks (meaning that you can store up to five zombies) by default, and the player can add five more hooks by spending 5 Toxin. This can be done 19 times until the Meat Locker can no longer be expanded (the maximum number of hooks is 100). In the Japanese version, zombies working in the caf√© and stored in the Meat Locker („Éü„Éº„Éà„É≠„ÉÉ„Ç´„Éº Mƒ´torokkƒÅ) can be used in a \\"Sacrifice Kitchen\\" (ÁîüË¥Ñ„Ç≠„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„É≥ Ikenie Kitchin) to be turned into recipes that make the zombies stronger. Up to 10 zombies can be used at a time. This makes for a useful way to get rid of unwanted zombies other than firing them. Combining two identical zombies will give a bonus to its stats, indicated by a mark above their level. This bonus maxes out after eating four identical zombies. Sacrified zombies give experience based on their rarity and level. Influence The game is influenced by Dungeons & Dragons style role- playing games. In addition to money, the player earns experience points for the restaurant. As the restaurant gains experience points, it goes up in levels, and the player is allowed to add new zombies to the staff. New levels also unlock new recipes and new items available for installation in the restaurant. As a unique twist on the SIM model, the zombie staff can be sent out to attack and raid other restaurants. If victorious, they will bring back food to either serve in the restaurant, without the time or expense of cooking it, or add to the menu to be cooked whenever the player chooses. In-app purchases Zombie Cafe offers in-app purchases. It is a slow game, gradually building up the funds to add or improve, but the player has the option of purchasing in-game Cash and/or Toxin to speed up the process. Some of the restaurant facilities and furnishings cost a great deal of money and while the restaurant has a relatively slow rate of earning money, the player has the option of spending actual money to purchase in-game Cash or Toxin. There is also a faster way of earning in-game money instead of spending real money: players can change their phone's clock to speed up the process. Controversy The game was part of a lawsuit filed against Apple Inc. Children were using their parents' devices to play games and were exercising the in-app purchase options, costing their parents a lot of money. Zombie Cafe was one of the games that children had used to run up expenses. As a result of the lawsuit, Apple made in-app purchases only accessible through a security check. Collaborations In 2014, Capcom made collaborations with Zombie Caf√© by having characters from the Mega Man, Ghosts 'n Goblins and Gaist Crusher series appear in the Japanese version of the game for a limited time. Critical reception Zombie Cafe has received mostly positive reviews since its release. The game received 9.0 out of 10 by App Store customer ratings and Appolicious, HiTPhone gave it 8.0, Gamezebo's Jim Squires gave it a 7.0. Slide To Play and GameRankings gave it a lower score of 5.0 out of 10.

He attended North Plainfield High School, graduating as part of the class of 1966, where he would meet the other future members of his first successful band, the Doughboys.Makin, Bob. \\"Makin Waves with Myke Scavone of Doughboys, Yardbirds\\", Courier News, June 19, 2016. Accessed September 30, 2016. \\"Q: What are you looking forward to most about playing the North Plainfield High School class reunion on Sept. 9? A: That's my 50th high school reunion.\\" Scavone joined his first band, the Apollos, in December 1964. He then joined the Ascots in 1965 with another member of the Apollos, guitarist Mike Farina. The band toured the United States opening for bands such as the Vagrants (which featured Leslie West on guitar) and the Hassles (which featured Billy Joel). They changed their name to The Doughboys in 1966 and secured a contract with Bell Records after winning a battle of the bands contest. Scavone was dismissed from the Doughboys in early 1968 when they decided to concentrate on instrumental music before disbanding at the end of that year. Following the disbandment of the Doughboys, Scavone began a career as a session drummer throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was performing on demos for producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz when he joined the newly formed Ram Jam, led by guitarist Bill Bartlett, in 1977. The band had found success with a cover of the song \\"Black Betty\\". Scavone performed on both of the band's albums, Ram Jam and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Ram before the band disbanded in 1978. He did not perform on the band's only hit, \\"Black Betty\\", as it had been recorded by Bill Bartlett's band Starstruck and credited to Ram Jam following Starstruck's disbandment. Following a period of inactivity in music, Scavone joined a reformed version of the Doughboys in 2000 and still performs with them. The reunion was originally intended to be a one-off.

After working for a radio station in Alabama, Passe was a baseball broadcaster for the Houston Buffaloes beginning in 1950. When Houston was awarded a major league franchise, the Houston Colt .45s (later renamed the Houston Astros), Passe was one of the team's broadcasters from 1962 to 1976. Biography Passe had worked in radio in Birmingham since at least 1944. Roy Hofheinz owned several radio stations in the American South, including the Birmingham station that employed Passe. In 1950, Hofheinz hired Passe to broadcast for the Houston Buffaloes, a minor league baseball team. When Houston received the expansion Colt .45s in 1962, Passe was one of the major league team's original broadcasters, joined by Gene Elston and Al Helfer. While Helfer only spent one season in Houston, Passe was partnered with Gene Elston from 1962 to 1976. In a 1971 Sports Illustrated article, Passe said that he preferred the rare televised game to his radio work, but he affirmed his love for broadcasting, saying, \\"When you love baseball the way I do and broadcast major league games from the great cities of the country‚Äîman, that's living.\\" While Elston was calm and neutral in the broadcast booth, Passe impartially cheered on the Astros, even when the team was not having a good season. After a nice Astros play, Passe was known to use odd phrases such as \\"hot ziggity dog and sassafras tea!\\" During away games, the Astros Spanish- language broadcasts were not live, as broadcaster Ren√© C√°rdenas simply listened to the English broadcasts and translated them. C√°rdenas said that Passe spoke such non-standard English that his words often could not be intelligibly translated into Spanish. Passe did not miss a game during his tenure with the Astros. He remained on the Astros broadcasting team until 1976. After leaving baseball, Passe was vice president of Osborne International, a freight company. He died of cancer at his Houston home on July 15, 1997. He was buried at Forest Park Westheimer in Houston. Passe was posthumously inducted into the Texas Radio Hall of Fame.

The FCC method overcomes several limitations of current numerical methods for solving linear FDEs. For instance, the FCC method can be used for linear incommensurate order FDEs and it does not require to be in canonical form. The essence of the method is that a discretization of the solution at the Chebyshev Gauss‚ÄìLobatto collocation points results in having spectral convergence and smaller computation time compared to finite difference methods. To accomplish this, a fractional differentiation matrix is derived at the Chebyshev Gauss‚ÄìLobatto collocation points by using the discrete orthogonal relationship of the Chebyshev polynomials. Then, using two proposed discretization operators for matrix functions results in an explicit form of solution for a system of linear FDEs with discrete delays. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed method can treat two common classes of linear FDEs: a system of linear commensurate order FDEs and a system of linear fractional-order delay-differential equations. The fractional Chebyshev differentiation matrix in the sense of Caputo, _{t_0} \\\\text{D}_{t_N}^\\\\alpha , is a linear map that maps the discretized function at the CGL points \\\\mathbf t=[t_0,t_1,\\\\ldots,t_N] onto the discretized fractional derivative of the function at those points : _{t_0}\\\\text{D}_{t_N}^\\\\alpha \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} {}_{t_0}^C\\\\mathcal{D}_t^\\\\alpha x(t_0) & {}_{t_0}^C\\\\mathcal{D}_t^\\\\alpha x(t_1) & \\\\cdots & {}_{t_0}^C\\\\mathcal{D}_t^\\\\alpha x(t_N) \\\\end{bmatrix}^T Then, it is shown that how a matrix function can be discretized in an interval at the CGL points by using two discretization operators. Finally, in two theories the solution of a system of linear commensurate order FDEs and a system of linear FDDEs are given by a state transition matrix.

Architecture  The congress center is situated on hilly terrain between the Aarhus Concert Hall and Sonnesgade at Godsbanen. The building is designed as a long glass covered promenade that covers the 11 meter height differential on the property. The central stairway runs obliquely through the building and includes walkways, elevators and greenery. The glass roof is supported by an arched pipe-construction. Materials for structure include yellow brick, black marble, granite, aluminum and jatoba for the floors. The project was completed by entrepreneur Per Aarsleff A/S and the cooperative Jord & Beton Amba by designs of the architects T. Skovgaard and Friis & Moltke. The landscape architect Sch√∏nherr designed the outdoors areas.  Background  In the late 1980s, Aarhus city council decided to place a new congress- and hotel center next to the Aarhus Concert Hall. The project was meant to revitalize the area around the concert hall, the river valley by Aarhus River and the old residential neighborhood M√∏lleengen but large parts of the project was never completed.

It is near the Harbour Bridge and is bounded by Kent Street, Watson Road, Upper Fort Street and Bradfield Highway, Millers Point. Its history dates back to 1796 when it was used as the site of the first windmill in the colony, when it was known as Windmill Hill. It is also the site of a number of historical buildings including the historic Sydney Observatory (thus often referred to as Observatory Hill), the Signal Station, the remains of Fort Philip, the National Trust Centre (formerly Fort Street High School) and a rotunda which is used for weddings. Overview Painting of Observatory Hill by Arthur Streeton in 1896 A windmill was constructed on the site in 1796 by John Davis, an Irish convict. It was a stone tower used to grind wheat. It subsided a few years later and was replaced by another windmill to the south. These structures gave rise to the name Windmill Hill for this area. In 1804 Fort Philip was built on the Hill. It was supplied with four 6-pounder cannons and a gunpowder magazine. The powder magazine was moved to Goat Island in 1833, and Fort Philip was partially demolished in the 1850s.City of Sydney website ‚ÄúHistory of Observatory Park‚Äù. Online reference A signal station was built on the eastern rampart of Fort Philip in 1847 which was for many years called the Fort Philip Signal Station. This is now open to the public. In 1858 Sydney Observatory was built near the signal station. For over a Century it played an essential role in shipping, navigation, meteorology and timekeeping and astronomy.Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences website. ‚ÄúHistorical Site‚Äù Online reference Today the building is used as museum and public observatory. The National Trust Centre which is near the Park was once a military hospital. It was built as a hospital in 1825 but closed in 1848 and became the Fort Street Model School. Although Fort Street School still exists on Observatory Hill the historic military hospital is now the headquarters of the National Trust and several rooms are available to hire as a venue. There is a Rotunda in the park which dates back to 1912. It has a views of Sydney Harbour and is sometimes used as venue for weddings. Fort Philip Remains of Fort Phillip today Fort Philip in 1842 Fort Philip In 1820 The remains of Fort Philip are still on Observatory Hill. They appear as the wall at the front and side of the signal station and are shown in the photo to the right. They are the eastern rampart of the Fort which was used as the foundations for the signal station when it was built in 1848. The chains on the wall which are still visible were used to limit the amount of recoil of the canons used in the Fort The construction of Fort Philip was commenced in 1804 by Governor King but it was never fully completed. It was built around the first windmill which can be seen in the painting of 1820. The tower of the ruined windmill was used for storage or accommodation for many years. It was intended that the Fort was to be hexagonal but only three sides were substantially completed. Construction ceased in 1806 and at this stage a report on the progress was given by the Colonial Secretary William Minchin. He said :\\"The ramparts, merlons (which were later dismantled) and embrasures of the three sides are nearly finished; the outer wall of the rampart of the fourth and fifth sides raised five feet; a bomb proof chamber of 14 feet square completed under one side and the foundation of the sixth side nearly laid.\\" The Fort was originally intended to suppress a possible insurrection by the Irish rebels who had been transported to Australia after the 1798 Rebellion in Ireland. The insurrection did not eventuate and the site was gradually used for other purposes. In 1815 Francis Greenway built a powder magazine next to the Fort which is shown in both of the watercolours. It was a rectangular structure which contained a 4-foot thick arched stone vault. However it too was not fully completed and the proposed stone roof was not built. Instead it had a temporary roof which subsequently became permanent and no further work was undertaken. Signal Station Signal Station on Observatory Hill Jeremiah McCarthy, Signal Master from 1902 until 1920 In 1808 a flagstaff was erected on Fort Phillip and by 1823 a semaphore had been placed there. A hut for the signalman was also built at this time which can be seen in the watercolour of 1842. The semaphore had two swinging arms which could be changed to various positions that spelled out numbers. These could be translated into letters by referring to a code book. The first hut for the signal station was very small consisting of only four rooms, two of which were bedrooms.Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences website. Online reference This was replaced in 1847 by the more substantial stone building designed by architect Mortimer Lewis which exists today. This building was the home of successive signal masters and their families until 1939 when the station was closed. In 1912 The Sun newspaper interviewed the resident signal master Jeremiah McCarthy and the article provides a colourful insight into the daily activities of the station. It explains how the flags are displayed on the pole to convey information. It stated: :\\"Two little rooms about 10 feet by 10 feet are all the indoor accommodation of the building that is required to carry on operations. One room constitutes the telegraph and telephone room and general office while the other is used as a flag locker for there are scores and scores of brightly coloured squares and triangles of bunting used in the signalling work, each one neatly rolled up and stowed away in its proper place ready for immediate use. :The signals are made in what seamen call ‚Äúhoists‚Äù As a vessel is sighted the flag of the company to which she belongs is sent up to the yardarm while to the signal staffhead is hoisted a square flag indicating whether she is a steamer or a sailing ship and two triangular ones which denote her last port of call fly immediately underneath. Thus for a P. and O. liner the company‚Äôs flag would be seen at the yardarm while up aloft would go a square chess board flag of blue and yellow indicating she was a steamer and the two triangular flags of different colours denoting her last port of call.\\" Jeremiah McCarthy had been appointed to the post of signal master in 1902 and he remained in this position until his death in 1920. Like many signal masters he had previous experience in the navy. He had also been a light house keeper on South Solitary Island and Smoky Cape for several years before this appointment. He had only one daughter who lived with him and his wife in the cottage until she married. Observatory Sydney Observatory Sydney Observatory in 1902 Henry Chamberlain Russell and his family in 1887 Sydney Observatory was built between 1857 and 1859. It was designed by Alexander Dawson, the Colonial Architect. It combines two types of architectural style - Italian High Renaissance Palazzo and the Italian Villa. A west wing was added to the building in 1876. The site of the building was chosen because it was clearly visible from the harbour. It was originally intended that it was to only provide a time service through the operation of the Time Ball which still functions today. The Ball was dropped at 1p.m. and at the same time a cannon was fired at Dawes Point and then in later years at Fort Denison. The purpose of the Time Ball was so that ships could readjust their chronometers after being at sea for extended periods. The Powerhouse Museum explains how the Time Ball works in the following terms: :\\"The Time Ball consists of a cast iron cylinder, piston, rack and pinion lifting mechanism, safety lock, electric motor and ball. The cylinder is 30cm diameter and 3 m long. Approximately 7 litres of soapy water fills the bottom of the cylinder to act as a buffer for the piston. The piston is a 10cm thick block of rubber with a bleeder valve to adjust the rate of descent. The rack extends from the piston to the Time Ball and is 7.5 meters long. A pinion engages into the rack by a slide gear, which enables the electric motor to raise the rack. A large hand wheel is also attached with a pawl gear to prevent back-slipping. The Time Ball is attached to the top of the rack and is raised 2.7 metres. :\\"At 6 minutes to 1PM the pinion is engaged into the rack and the electric motor switched on. It takes approx 2 minutes and 50 seconds to raise the ball to the top of the mast. The safety lock is then engaged and the pinion is disengaged. At precisely 1PM a signal from the atomic clock disengages the safety lock, causing the Time Ball to drop. It drops approximately 2 metres immediately and the back pressure in the cylinder causes it to drop the remaining distance at a slower rate.\\" The longest serving Government Astronomer to occupy the Observatory was Henry Chamberlain Russell who held this position from 1870 until his death in 1907. Russell reorganized the observatory for systematic work on star positions and observations of double stars and star clusters. He had a close association with the University of Sydney. He was a fellow of the Senate of the University in 1875-1907 and vice- chancellor in 1891-92. In 1921 The Sydney Mail published a detailed article on the work being done at the observatory at this time. Rotunda The Rotunda in 1932 at the opening of Sydney Harbour Bridge The Rotunda was built in 1912. The Metropolitan Band played regularly in the building particularly on Sunday afternoons and evenings. John Palmer was the conductor at this time.Sydney Morning Herald, 13 January 1923, p. 16. Online reference He played classical music and also selections from Gilbert and Sullivan. The City of Sydney Band were also frequent entertainers in the Park. Today the Rotunda is sometimes used as a venue for weddings. It has views over the harbour and has surrounding parkland.

The stones in the structure are over 200 years old as they came from a building at Circular Quay built in the time of Governor Macquarie.The Manning River Times, 8 June 1940, p. 1. Online reference The unveiling was conducted by Major General Sir Charles Cox who at that time was 77 years old and needed to lean on a friend‚Äôs arm.

History Hope was educated at Owen's College, Manchester, and studied for the ministry at Lancashire Independent College. His first appointment was in 1872 to the Congregational Church in Bungay, Suffolk. In late 1873 he left for South Australia aboard the Stratton Audley, and was in May 1874 appointed to Clayton Congregational Church, in Kensington, South Australia, as successor to Eliezer Griffiths who had departed for Britain and America, and William Harcus, who had embarked on a career in journalism. During his tenure at the Clayton Church the congregation grew to such an extent that a new, larger church building was called for, and was built within a few years and officially opened on 17 May 1882. The Sunday-school was also steadily growing in numbers, and a Young Men's Society and Young Christians' Union were founded and flourished. Hope resigned in August 1890, after sixteen years at Clayton. He moved to Sydney in September 1890 to take the ministry of the Congregational Church at Waverley. In July 1894 he commenced at Hindmarsh Congregational Church where he served for 14 years, and was also responsible for oversight of the Henley Beach Congregational Church, which was served by lay preachers. On his retirement he was made honorary pastor. His successor was Rev. Percival Watson. He also served Clayton Church in various capacities, filling the positions of Moderator and acting pastor when the Church was without a minister, and was made honorary pastorate for life in February 1916. For many years he was the Secretary of the Parkin Congregational Mission, and of the Union College. On the death of his brother-in-law, the Rev.
