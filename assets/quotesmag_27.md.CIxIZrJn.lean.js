The Sinfonia plays concerts for over 25,000 people each year, and is the only professional orchestra of its kind, offering all concerts free of charge, welcoming children to every performance, and dedicating over half its services to inner-city schools. Founded in 1989 by Artistic Director Jay Fishman, the Minnesota Sinfonia is an independent, non-profit 501(c)(3) organization supported by corporate, foundation and individual contributors. Programs =Music in the schools= Music in the Schools (MIS) is the Sinfonia‚Äôs inner- city education program. Every year, the orchestra works with up to 12,000 elementary students and helps them learn core subjects in exciting new ways‚Äìthrough music! Music in the School s is designed specifically for public elementary students of Minneapolis and St. Paul's diverse population with limited in-school arts opportunities. MIS uses classical music to excite students about math, history, science, social studies and literature, while providing a much-needed part of their arts education. Each MIS program starts with a three-month curriculum, co-developed by the Sinfonia and local teachers. The curriculum combines classical music excerpts with academic concepts drawn from Minnesota state education standards, and focuses on a different subject each year. Past programs include History as Seen Through Music, which used Aaron Copland's A Lincoln Portrait to introduce President Abraham Lincoln, his speeches and his role in the Civil War. The Magical Mysteries of Math & Music used Joseph Haydn's \\"Surprise\\"¬ù Symphony and other well-known classical works to help explain a variety of mathematical concepts. The 2009-2010 program, Music From Other Lands, presented classical music derived from folk songs. The culmination of each Music in the Schools program is 'Sinfona Day' ‚Äì a visit from the entire Minnesota Sinfonia to each participating school. As part of the festivities, classrooms host visits from orchestra musicians, who interact with the students and share their own stories and experience. =Young Artist Competition= The Young Artist Competition is an annual competition for musicians up to age 19. Held every spring, the contest attracts residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Wisconsin, who compete in a friendly environment. Both the junior and senior division winners are awarded solo appearances with the Sinfonia, and the senior division winner also receives the Claire Givens Violins $500 cash prize. The competition is held at the University of St. Thomas campus in St. Paul. =Youth Outreach Week= 25 young musicians experience a \\"week in the life\\" of a professional musician. Students participate in a week of intensive orchestra rehearsals, culminating in a joint concert with the Minnesota Sinfonia. =Junior Composers Competition= Junior Composers and alumni up to age 19, compose celebratory, high-spirited works that will be part of the Sinfonia‚Äôs Young Artists Week, culminating in a performance of the winning entry at the orchestra‚Äôs Summer Concert Series. Concert Offerings =Winter Concert Series= Classical programs performed in Twin Cities neighborhood venues. These concerts feature guest soloists from around the world, orchestral repertoire and new works by American composers. =Summer Concert Series= Classical repertoire and award-winning guest soloists. Concerts take place in outdoor settings in St. Paul and Minneapolis. =Holiday and Summer Pops Concerts= Performed throughout the seven county metro area, these programs contain music from movies, Broadway, favorite waltzes =Music and Arts Festivals= Community festivals provided to under- served Minnesota communities. The festivals include neighborhood children performing with the Minnesota Sinfonia, local music groups and local artist displays as well many other activities. =Greater Minnesota Touring= The Minnesota Sinfonia brings educational and concert programs designed especially for communities that have limited access to the arts to out-state Minnesota. History In the 1980s, conductor Jay Fishman envisioned a professional, top-quality orchestra that would dedicate its services to the underserved and low-income residents of Minnesota. In 1989, he created the Minnesota Sinfonia, a professional chamber orchestra to serve families, children, inner-city youth, seniors, and those with limited incomes. Early on, the Sinfonia developed policies of free admission and children welcome to all performances. The Sinfonia was the first, and is still the only professional orchestra in the state to have such policies. As one of three professional orchestras in the Twin Cities, the Sinfonia is the only one to offer all concerts free of admission charges, to perform in accessible neighborhood locations year-round and to welcome children to every performance. The Sinfonia is dedicated to community service and education. Each year, the Sinfonia performs more free, in-school concerts than any professional orchestra in the state, allocating over 30 percent of its budget and half its concerts to educational programs. Our guiding values are quality, accessibility and education. Artistic Director Jay Fishman has been the artistic and executive director of the Minnesota Sinfonia since its inception in 1989. Under his leadership, the Sinfonia inaugurated its policies of free admission and welcoming children to all concerts, and created Music in the Schools, the orchestra‚Äôs education program for inner-city elementary students. Jay earned a bachelor of science in music education and bachelor of arts in music composition from the University of Minnesota in 1969. In 1974, he earned a master's degree in orchestral conducting from the Indiana University School of Music. Also in 1974, he was a finalist in the Fulbright-Hayes Conducting Fellowship. From 1974 to 1976, Jay served as music director and conductor for the Louisville Chamber Orchestra. He then traveled to London, where he worked with Sir Neville Mariner of the Academy of Saint Martin in the Fields Chamber Orchestra. While in London, he also recorded for BBC Radio. In 1978, Jay Fishman returned to the United States and for 11 years served as the music director of the Minneapolis Chamber Symphony (MCS), which he founded. Under his leadership, the MCS received local, regional and national accolades, including the Award for Excellence from the McKnight Foundation and ongoing support from the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1989, Jay founded the Minnesota Sinfonia and took on the role of executive and artistic director. To date, he has conducted over 1,300 performances, and introduced classical music to 150,000 inner-city elementary students. In 2008, he led a symposium on use of the professional orchestra in music education for the Arts Midwest Regional Conference, and spoke on the same subject to the Association of Wisconsin Orchestras in May 2010. Venues The Minnesota Sinfonia plays at the following venues in the Minneapolis / St. Paul \\"Twin Cities\\" as well as tours to Greater Minnesota Communities: Winter: The Basilica of Saint Mary (Minneapolis), Metropolitan State University (St. Paul), The University of Minnesota (Minneapolis), Temple Israel (Minneapolis), Temple of Aaron (St. Paul), First Covenant Church (St. Paul), Annunciation Church (Minneapolis), Summer: Como Park, Lake Harriet Bandshell, Lake Phalen Regional Park, Caponi Art Park, Minnesota Zoo, Coon Rapids Regional Dam Park, Roseville Central Park, Camp Courage, John A.

Accident The airplane had departed Khartoum International Airport at 13:27 on 11 November and, after a stopover at Nyala, arrived at Zalingei at 16:18, finding good weather conditions. The Antonov landed heavily on Zalingei's dirt runway 03, bounced and made another heavy contact with the ground, causing the landing gear and engines to shear off. Fuel from the ruptured wings ignited, and the resulting fire consumed most of the wreckage. Aircraft The aircraft involved was a twin-turboprop Antonov An-24 with Sudanese registration ST-ARQ. It was built in 1970. Investigation Sudan's Air Accident Investigation Central Directorate (SAAICD) conducted an investigation into the crash. It found that the flight data recorder did not contain any data, and that the cockpit voice recorder contained only four minutes of recording, of which none where from the accident flight. The SAAICD attributed the accident to the flight crew's poor performance and co-ordination in executing the landing. Four safety recommendations were made.

It is usually removed from the plant for decorative use. Typical uses are in vase displays, wreaths and garlands. Many gardeners harvest their own cut flowers from domestic gardens, but there is a significant floral industry for cut flowers in most countries. The plants cropped vary by climate, culture and the level of wealth locally. Often the plants are raised specifically for the purpose, in field or glasshouse growing conditions. Cut flowers can also be harvested from the wild. The cultivation and trade of flowers is a specialization in horticulture, specifically floriculture. Cultivation Cut flower cultivation is intensive, usually on the basis of greenhouse monocultures, and requires large amounts of highly toxic pesticides, residues of which can often still be found in flower shops on imported flowers. These facts have spurred the development of movements like \\"Slow Flowers\\", which propagates sustainable floriculture in the consumer country (U.S., Canada) itself.https://slowflowers.com/about-us.html Uses A common use is for floristry, usually for decoration inside a house or building. Typically the cut flowers are placed in a vase. A number of similar types of decorations are used, especially in larger buildings and at events such as weddings. These are often decorated with additional foliage. In some cultures, a major use of cut flowers is for worship; this can be seen especially in south and southeast Asia. Sometimes the flowers are picked rather than cut, without any significant leaf or stem. Such flowers may be used for wearing in hair, or in a button-hole. Masses of flowers may be used for sprinkling, in a similar way to confetti. Garlands, wreaths and bouquets are major derived and value added products.

Longevity Cape ivy in a vase. Once flowers are removed from the plant they continue to grow slowly, but have a diminished capability of receiving the nutrients that are vital for their survival. In most countries, cut flowers are a local crop because of their perishable nature. In India, much of the product has a shelf life of only a day. Among these are marigold flowers for garlands and temples, which are typically harvested before dawn, and discarded after use the same day. The majority of cut flowers can be expected to last several days with proper care. This generally requires standing them in water in shade. They can be treated in various ways to increase their life. According to James C. Schmidt, a horticulturist at the University of Illinois, originally putting cut flowers in a sterilized vase is important to extending the life of the flowers. Vases can be cleaned using a household dish detergent or a combination of water and bleach. Using these disinfectants ensures that there will be less bacteria growing within the vase that could potentially cause the plant to wilt and die at a faster rate. Schmidt also claims that cutting the flowers diagonally with a sharp knife under running water ensures that they can immediately take up fresh and clean water. Re-cutting the stems periodically will ensure that there is a fresh surface from which the stems can take up water. This will allow the flowers to last even longer. Other ways to care for vase flowers includes keeping flowers away from ceiling fans and air-conditioning vents as this can lead to dehydration, keeping flowers away from fresh fruit of vegetables, using filtered water rather than tap water so as to avoid both chlorine and fluoride, and keeping flowers away from your television. There is also a market for 'everlasting' or dried flowers, which include species such as Xerochrysum bracteatum. These can have a very long shelf life. =Additives= According to the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, different additives can be used to prolong the lives of fresh cut flowers. Experiments were performed with various substances mixed with water, including aspirin, vitamin pills, vinegar, pennies, and flower food to test their effect on cut flowers' lifespans. Each plant was placed in the same environment and the same type of plant was used in each vase. This research found that the best additive for flowers was the retailer-provided \\"flower food\\" that is usually given with a bouquet. Plants are known to thrive in an environment where there are few bacteria, plenty of food for energy, and water uptake is encouraged. Flower foods contain an acidifier that helps to adjust the water's pH. With a lower pH the water and food conducting system within the flower can work at maximum efficiency. The sugar in the food will be used by the plant as an energy source, which had been lost when the flower was cut away from its root. With these nutrients the plant will be able to fully develop. Finally, there are stem unpluggers that will make sure that the flower can easily take up water and nutrients that can later be used to take care of the needs of the rest of the plant.Additives for cut flowers This combination gives the fresh cut flowers everything that they need to survive longer. When tests were carried out in St. Mary's College C.S.S.p, Rathmines, Dublin, however, results showed that glucose was more effective at prolonging the life of cut flowers than the commercial plant food. The experiment was carried out as part of the Junior Certificate Science Examination set by the Irish State Examinations Commission 2008. Trade The largest producers are, in order of cultivated area, China, India, and the United States. The largest importer and exporter by value is the Netherlands, which is both a grower and a redistributor of crops imported from other countries. Most of its exports go to its European neighbours. In recent decades, with the increasing use of air freight, it has become economic for high value crops to be grown far from their point of sale; the market is usually in industrialised countries. Typical of these is the production of roses in Ecuador and Colombia, mainly for the US market, and production in Kenya and Uganda for the European market. Some countries specialise in especially high value products, such as orchids from Singapore and Thailand. As with the production of fruit and vegetables, the industry depends on significant amounts of water, which may be collected and stored by the farm owners. The Patel Dam failure in May 2018, associated with a large Kenyan rose farm, killed dozens of people. The total market value in most countries is considerable. It has been estimated at approximately GBP 2 billion in the United Kingdom, of the same order as that of music sales.

TVEI was announced in 1982 and a pilot scheme started in 1983. TVEI was extended nationally in 1987, and was thereafter often known as TVEI extension, sometimes abbreviated TVEE. It ended in 1997. It was the first major intervention by central Government in curriculum development in England. Organised on a local authority basis, with each local authority able to develop and implement plans relevant to their area. Computers were revolutionising the workplace and providing new opportunities for employment as well as requiring new skills and attitudes in the workforce and in society. The BBC and the UK Government developed the BBC micro computer for the schools sector and TVEI supported the channelling of funds and training into the schools sector to enable computer rooms, equipped by BBCs to be set up in schools. Prior to this, typically, the mathematics department might have had access to one computer at a remote location. The strategy for the implementation of TVEI provides an example of positive change management in an education system with government engaging with educators and industry to support innovation and development in uncertain times. It can be argued that this investment which led to pupils having access to the latest technology, a supported creative curriculum and an encouragement with experimentation, had a seminal role in providing the foundations for the successful UK animation industry. The history of this period is recorded in publications by several UK organisations - the Association for IT in Teacher Education (Hammond et al. 2011), the Mirandanet initiative. The ITTE Voices project provides a record of educators experiences in this period. Evaluation of the TVEI initiative was obligatory. In the London Borough of Enfield, the evaluation strategy was to use teacher-researchers based in schools (Leask, 1998), following Lawrence Stenhouse's effective teacher-research model used for the evaluation of the Humanities Curriculum Project. Professor Helen Simons, a colleague of Stenhouse, set up the Enfield model, later managed by Professor David Hopkins at what was the Cambridge Institute of Education. Hopkins, 1989, includes a section explaining the system. Teacher Researchers were trained and gathered data in schools on agreed topics using agreed methodologies. The data were then anonymised and reported giving schools a basis for comparison with their peers. The archive of the Enfield Teacher Researcher approach is held by Professor Marilyn Leask, De Montfort University, UK. MirandaNet established 1992, specialises in education/industry collaboration and with industry hosted seminars for educators where forthcoming technologies were showcased for educators. Many leading IT companies appointed education staff to support strong education/industry partnerships. The UK Austerity Period fuelled by the international banking crises of the early 21st century, curbed UK industry investment in educational innovation. A Museum of Educational Computing holding programmes and equipment from this period to more recent times is in the care of Dr Richard Millwood deputy and researcher and developer at what at the time was a leading innovation unit - Ultralab (closed around 2008), Anglia Ruskin University, UK. A National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park has more general information about the development of computing.

Plan guidelines The plan was prepared in just three months by a team led by Celso Furtado. The objective of the plan was to return GDP growth to the 7% of previous governments, after the complete failure of Jo√£o Goulart's initial economic policies, and for the first time to start a plan for income distribution. This plan was based on the principle of progressive import substitution, blaming the rise of prices on the structural imbalances of the Brazilian economy, ignoring the effect of the exchange rate on prices. To reach the dreamed-of performance of 7%, 3.5 trillion \\"cruzeiros\\" (the current currency) were allocated for investments at 1962 prices, assuming that this would cause a rise of per capita income from US$323,00 in 1962 to US$363,00 by 1965. There were also expectations for an impossible 70% growth of industry. For both sectoral goals were established of 4.3 million tons of iron slabs by 1965, 190 thousand cars and 270 thousand trucks, and growth of installed capacity and power generation to 7.432.00 kW in 1965. The objectives conflicted, showing evidence of poor planning: raising taxes while ignoring the effect on private investments, reducing wasteful public expenditures while nevertheless raising salaries, raising money from bank stock without creating any regulatory rule for it, and an attempt to obtain external resources even with hostility growing toward the foreign capital. Results The plan was doomed to failure even before the overthrow of the Goulart government, starting by the failure in reaching the 25% as inflation target, and the growing of 0.6% of the GDP in 1963. In 1964, the general inflation was 91.8%. Despite the failure, the situation the Plano Trienal was formulated, in the short period of time, using non-reliable information and statistics, in the lack of Brazilian experience until then with this kind of plan and the ignorance of the effects of the policies adopted. The Plano Trienal, under this point of view, was important to improve the planning efforts of the country. The failure of the Plano Trienal created a serious institutional crisis. Jo√£o Goulart, in a desperate attitude at the end of the plan, began to make use of decrees, trying to nationalize several private oil industries, and expropriate some areas for an alleged land reform, causing anger in the Brazilian medium and high classes, worn by the bad economic conduct, which eventually stimulated the overthrow of the government.

Overview Insert studios are generally smaller than a standard soundstage, and are used for television and media interviews with individuals or small groups of people. It is also common for the host, or presenter of a program to conduct their part of a show from an insert studio when they are away from their home base. Insert studios usually have permanent or on-demand connectivity to larger entities via telecommunications networks using various means including coaxial cable, fiber, VPN, or satellite uplink. Telephone lines are required for coordination, direction, and interruptible feedback. Effect on contribution content Insert studios play an important contribution role in modern public affairs television programming. They can be in places far removed from the shows and networks they serve. This enables contributors in remote places to be part of a discourse. They also help equalize a tendency to over utilize sources in major cities.http://ijoc.org/ojs/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/252/144 They also enable entities like small market television stations to get content for programming without a travel budget. Technological advantages Because insert studios frequently take advantage of terrestrial communications circuits, there is reduced latency when compared with traditional satellite uplink from remote locations. This often allows for a faster exchange between program host and contributor/guest, and has led to a new breed of programming that utilize pundits and a rapid fire exchange of ideas as a staple of content. Economic considerations Insert studios also play an important role because they can be used (‚Äúbooked‚Äù) for periods less than a traditional production day. They are also self-contained, allowing for economy compared with traditional newsgathering methods involving the use of separate individuals in the field responsible for producing, camerawork, sound, and transmission on a temporary basis in remote locations. Because insert studios are pre-set, the technology can be often be run either by a single de-skilled operator or even remotely. Travel costs can be reduced because the subject(s) may go to a local or nearby site. Implications for television journalism Contributors must travel to the camera inside the studio, rather than the camera moving closer to the story. This is an important distinction because the camera is further removed from a documentary role on the newsgathering process. Also, as traditional sources of television news shrink their production budgets and rely on remote studios more for content, there is a new and increasing bias toward including experts from institutions that pay to maintain their own studios, and contribute content at a discount relative to traditional coverage methods, or even completely subsidize their own coverage. So while a more diverse list of contributors benefits programming coverage, technology and economics can enable contributors to effectively pay to play which if not disclosed can negatively impact journalism.

She was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2010 for her focus on water quality and for fighting pollution from concentrated animal feeding facilities. She exposed the polluting practices of livestock factory farms in rural Michigan, gaining the attention of the federal EPA and prompting state regulators to issue hundreds of citations for water quality violations. Henning currently works for the Socially Responsible Agricultural Project (SRAP). She also won the Planet Defender Award 2012 for her advocacy and her work.  Environmental activism  Lynn Henning claims that livestock factory farms have to be held accountable for water and air quality. She gained attention through claiming on state and federal authorities to ensure them that these laws on water and air quality are not violated. She herself runs a 300-acres corn and soybeans farm in Lenawee County within 10 miles of 12 CAFO's - Concentrated animal feeding operations. In 2000 a Michigan state park lake was polluted by a runoff, and the Hennings were blamed for blowing the whistle on a local Concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO). Although this accusation was false, it inspired Henning for her work and led to the formation of the Environmentally Concerned Citizens of South Central Michigan (ECCSCM) with other neighbors. Henning and the ECCSCM began to bring the CAFO to justice and urged state and federal agencies to step forward and protect the environmental and public health of region. She started to collect information about CAFO pollution, took water samples from lakes, streams, rivers and wetland and as well about their point of origin. Henning then joined the Sierra Club's chapter in Michigan. With their support, Henning developed water quality monitoring programs to measure the pollution levels from CAFOs and documented their impact on local watersheds. Henning used also satellite imagery and GPS coordinates to document where the pollution was happening and how waterways were being affected. Henning and the ECCSCM brought together a body of data on CAFOs and managed that state regulators have to take stronger action, such as the Department for Environmental Quality (D.E.Q.). Her engagement led the D.E.Q. to enact hundreds of citations against Michigan CAFOs for their environmental violations. Furthermore her findings and recommendations led to a denial of a proposed CAFO facility Fighting against CAFOs didn‚Äôt come without any consequences for Lynn. She and her family have been threatened and harassed for being an environmental activist. Henning regularly travels to assist other communities across the country to challenge CAFOs. Her techniques have been included in other CAFO investigations. The former head of US Environment Protection Agency Lisa P. Jackson said that her department would strengthen the regulation of the Clean Water Act which regulates CAFO waste. Today Henning works for the Socially Responsible Agricultural Project (SRAP), together with this initiative she launched the national initiative \\"Water ranger program\\", which helps those who are affected by CAFOs to become citizen scientists.

After the purchase, Fujita-gumi increased its capital and invested heavily in skilled labor and equipment. By 1888 the Kosaka mine became Japan's top producer of silver. In 1900, an engineer at Kosaka succeeded in extracting copper by accessing the kuroko (black ore ‚Äî a mixture of copper, zinc and lead) deep in the mine. After that, the Kosaka changed its focus from silver to copper, and in 1907 became Japan's largest top producer.

It is a member of the Mitsubishi group and a participant of Mitsubishi Kinyokai and Mitsubishi Public Affairs Committee. Former headquarters.  History  Since its predecessor, Tokyo Logistics, was founded in 1887 and changed the corporate name to its current one in 1918, Mitsubishi Logistics reached its 120th anniversary in 2007. Among the Mitsubishi zaibatsu, the foundation of Mitsubishi Logistics followed the establishment of NYK line, Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Mitsubishi Bank (currently The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ); the company has tradition and history. The Edobashi warehouse building, which was built in 1930 and was originally where the company's headquarters was located, has a unique appearance reminiscent of a ship and has been designated Tokyo's historic landmark as a renowned art piece of expressionistic architecture. A renovation project is underway to redesign the building into a skyscraper, 18 stories high and 1 story deep, while preserving the building fa√ßade. The corporate headquarters is temporarily relocated in Shinkawa, Chuo- ku.  Business contents  Mitsubishi Logistics‚Äô business can be categorized into two areas; logistics and real estate. The company's main businesses are in warehouse management, seaport logistics, and real estate. The company's logistics business has a history of 120 years and owns affiliate companies throughout the world. Its performance ranks at the top among Japan's logistics industry. Mitsubishi Logistics possesses Japan's largest warehouse. It works closely with its subsidiaries abroad and has a good track record in handling pharmaceuticals and chemicals. It owns 63,000-ton refrigerated warehouses, one in eastern Japan and another in western, namely Oi in Tokyo and Rokk≈ç Island in Kobe. Mitsubishi Logistics is profitable in real estate business too and actively invests in office and commercial buildings and residential houses. It develops many ‚Äúdatacenter-compatible buildings‚Äù such as Tokyo Dia Building, and is a pioneer and holds the largest domestic market share in buildings for rent with emergency generators, high earthquake resistance, and multi-carrier systems (Tokyo Dia Building is the largest seismically isolated building in Japan). With regards to commercial facilities, the company developed Kobe Harbor Land for example, a commercial complex in western Japan. Eastern Japan saw the opening of Yokohama Bay Quarter outside the eastern gate of Yokohama Station on August 24, 2006. Mitsubishi Logistics is also undertaking development of condominiums including Nabeaure Yokohama Tower Residence and M. M. Towers Foresis.  Yokohama Dia Building  Yokohama Dia Building is one of the largest office buildings in the area. The middle to upper floors of the building are designated rental office space. To mark the end of its site redevelopment project outside Yokohama Station, on December 16, 2009, the company completed its construction of Yokohama Dia Building, which was among the largest buildings in the area and had a unique appearance of uniform design and glass curtain walls. Yokohama Dia Building is 31 stories high, 2 stories deep and has a 2-story-high penthouse. It measures 157.7 meters in height (which is the third tallest after Landmark Tower and Queens Tower (A) in Yokohama) and has an area size of 69,977 square meters. The 3rd to 6th floors are for commercial uses and are connected to Yokohama Bay Quarter on each floor, while the 7th to 30th floors are designated rental office space. The architecture was a long-awaited, large-scale office building in Yokohama where development of large office buildings remained rather inactive since the 1990s. It was also an office building of high quality that could compete with those constructed one after another in Tokyo during the 2000s. The building is connected directly to Yokohama Station via a pedestrian deck (Bay Quarter Walkway) that was concurrently constructed and allows people to access the station without getting rained on.

Niwa, Tomoe, Nishizono) is one of the most prominent manufacturers of bearings in Japan, second domestically only to NSK Ltd. The company is one of the largest exporters worldwide of friction-reducing products such as constant-velocity joints. It is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a component of the Nikkei 225 stock index. History =Beginnings= The beginning of the Japanese bearing industry was started by competitor Nippon Seiko (now known as NSK) producing such bearings in 1914. Four years later in 1918, Nishizono Ironworks, a factory in Uchibori, Mie Prefecture began producing ball bearings. =NTN Formation and Split= Five years after Nishizono Ironworks began its production of these friction reducing components, the company merged with Tomoe Trading to fabricate and market them under the name \\"NTN\\". In 1927, however, Nishizono and Tomoe split, with the former company setting up a new company called \\"NTN Manufacturing Company\\". =Toyo Bearing Manufacturing= In 1934, the company reorganized as a joint- stock company, changing its name to Toyo Bearing Manufacturing. When Japan invaded Manchuria, the demand for bearings increased due to the war, and manufacturing productivity followed suit. In 1938, Toyo created a domestic subsidiary named Showa Bearing Manufacturing Company, in Mukogun, Hyogo Prefecture. Toyo absorbed Showa into its organization the following year, making the facility into its Mukogawa plant and merging Mukogawa's operations with those of their newly established plant in Kuwana. By 1945, raw materials shortages that resulted from World War II rendered Japanese bearing manufacturers unable to produce at full capacity. However, in the late 1940s, as Japan recovered from combat, demand from the war-torn country and its intracontinental neighbors increased. =NTN Sales= At the end of the decade, Toyo created a marketing division called NTN Sales, at the same time, becoming one of the five most prominent bearing manufacturers in Japan, alongside Koyo Seiko, Nippon Seiko, Asahi Seiko and Fujikoshi Kozai. They, along with the other four aforementioned companies held over 75% of that country's bearing market the following year. Three years later, in 1954, NTN Sales received the Deming Prize for statistical quality control while continuing to diversify its product offering. In 1956, the company started to manufacture expansion compensating bearings. Due to the incredible growth that Toyo underwent, the organization decentralized by creating subsidiaries to oversee new products. In 1961, Toyo set up a joint venture with INA W√§lzlager Schaeffler called NTN W√§lzlager Europa in order to manufacture needle bearings. Toyo utilized design data from INA W√§lzlager Schaeffler to make these products. They also established Kongo Bearing Company to manage the creation of pillow block bearings. One year later, Toyo founded Senyo Kosakuki Kenkyujo, a maker of ball bearing equipment. In 1963, Toyo entered into business with Hardy Spicer to produce Birfield-type constant-velocity universal joints. They also pursued business overseas by establishing NTN Bearing Corporation of America. The following year, working with GKN Transmission, the company fabricated constant-velocity joints in their home country and formed NTN Bearing-GKN while also opening a facility in Europe called NTN France. The year after that, Toyo started manufacturing oil- impregnated sintered bearings and pipe fittings. Four years later in 1968, the company set up yet another facility in North America called NTN Bearing Corporation of Canada. In 1971, Toyo started Toyo Bearing Okayama Company to produce automotive tapered bearings and roller bearings in addition to founding American NTN Bearing Manufacturing Corporation. It was during that same year that Toyo finished construction on a manufacturing facility in Schiller Park, their first manufacturing facility in North America. Additionally, a sales division, NTN Trading-Hong Kong and a manufacturing segment, NTN Kugellagerfabrik were created. =NTN Toyo Bearing Company= The following year, the company's name was changed from Toyo Bearing Manufacturing to NTN Toyo Bearing Company. Like other Japanese bearing manufacturers, NTN became so successful that it created angst among their overseas competitors, especially those in the United Kingdom. England in fact, urged Japanese companies to restrict exports from 1972-1974. Other countries in Europe, however, were quite adamant about procuring such superior quality bearings, and continued to do so. For this reason, the company's growth was uninterrupted during the mid-1970s. In fact, from 1973‚Äì1975, NTN Manufacturing Canada, NTN de Mexico and NTN Suramericana were opened, in addition to another factory in Elgin, Illinois. In 1977 however, NTN Toyo posted a loss of 1 billion JPY due to the increasing value of the Japanese Yen making exports more expensive. Because most of their bearings were still made inside the borders of Japan, the prices of the bearings were still subject to changes in international exchange rates. Additionally, many Japanese bearing manufacturers were penalized by the European Economic Community for predatory pricing. As a result, in 1978, for the first time in over a decade, NTN Toyo withheld dividend payments. The value of the yen soon decreased however, and the company's exports returned to normal. Strong customer demand also resulting from the weakening yen resulted in increased sales. By 1979, all overseas NTN Toyo manufacturing facilities were once again operating at or above full production capacity. After NTN Toyo recovered from its downturn, the company looked to expand its constant-velocity joint business in the United States. By expanding on all of their product lines in this part of the world, NTN Toyo was able to reduce the number of goods exported from Japan. In 1982, the company built an addition onto its Okayama plant for the purpose of building automotive joints. In addition, a joint venture with Hyundai Motors had this business partner manufacturing joints via a license from NTN Toyo. The following year, NTN Toyo also licensed Lepco Company and Taiway to produce additional constant-velocity joints. From 1984 to 1985, NTN Toyo concentrated on tapered roller bearings at its United States facilities such as their Elgin factory. This building was added onto in 1984 in order to produce such bearings at a higher rate of production. In 1985, NTN Toyo Nagano Works, a designer and manufacturer of precision miniature bearings, also opened for business. That same year, NTN Toyo partnered with Federal-Mogul Corporation to produce tapered bearings and cylindrical roller bearings. The new joint venture, NTN-Bower Corporation, inherited two Federal-Mogul facilities and an additional research facility. NTN Toyo initially owned 60% of this joint venture, but purchased the remaining 40% of NTN-Bower Corporation two years later to fully acquire the company. In 1986, the company constructed its Kuwana plant, NTN Toyo's first factory dedicated to bearings used in aerospace products. Soon after this facility was established, Timken Company claimed that NTN Toyo and other Japanese bearing makers were selling their products below market prices. As a result, the United States Department of Commerce found those companies guilty of predatory pricing. NTN Toyo was ordered to pay a financial penalty equal to 47% of the prices of the products that the company exported to that country. In 1988, NTN Toyo established its first technical center in Michigan, added a bearing-hub factory in Elgin, and partnered with GKN Transmission and Borg-Warner to produce constant-velocity joints in Australia under the name Unidrive. Borg-Warner owned 50% of the company, GKN owned 30% and NTN Toyo owned 20%. =NTN USA Corporation/Name Change of Conglomerate to NTN Corporation= In the following year, NTN Toyo changed its name to NTN Corporation while creating a new constant-velocity joint factory and research and development center for NTN Driveshaft in Columbus, Indiana. As a result of globalization, with bearings being further governed by international guidelines, NTN consolidated its foreign operations while trying to expand further into cutting edge markets. In order to expand North American operations, the company formed NTN USA Corporation, which was slated to become a holding company for their existing US divisions. They also established an office to oversee the fabrication activities of their existing operations. One of NTN's objectives was to begin production of constant- velocity joints in North America. One of their first steps in doing so was the 1996 purchase of Federal-Mogul's ball bearings sector. =Twenty-first Century Developments= In addition to North America, NTN established in 2000 a constant-velocity joint and bearing manufacturing facility in Thailand called NTN Manufacturing Company Limited. To manage the explosion of the company's portfolio, colloquially known as the \\"Four Base Production and Sales System\\", NTN reorganized its operations. As a result, NTN Sales Corporation was made a part of the conglomerate. The following year, the company partnered with FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schafer AG to sell bearings in both North America and Europe. This partnership helped create factories in both Portugal and Hungary. NTN also started its \\"Management System Transformation Project\\" with the goal of making its regional and international operations more efficient. A Program Office was created to manage a number of subprojects. These subprojects were created to improve client relations and improve productivity. The company then in 2002, took part in three separate joint ventures. First, they set up Shanghai NTN Corporation for the purpose of producing constant-velocity joint cassettes. Second, working with Nidec Corporation, created NTN-NIDEC Corporation in Zhejiang, China. Then, in their final joint venture that year, the company, in conjunction with Taiwan Yulon Group Corporation, created Guangzhou NTN-Yulon Drivetrain to fabricate additional constant velocity joints. The year after this, three new companies were formed, two in the United States and one in China. The two American companies, named NTK Precision Axle Corporation and Asahi Forge of America Corporation provided heat treatment and forging services, respectively. The company in China was called Beijing NTN-Seohan Driveshaft, and served as an additional manufacturing facility for their constant-velocity joint platform. In the year 2004, NTN Mie Corporation and Shangzhou NTN-Guangyang Corporation were formed for bearing fabrication while Nagano Works, Kuwana Works, Iwata Works, and Okayama Works earned ISO/TS16949 and ISO9001 certifications.

The Aukan or Ndyuka speak the Ndyuka language. They are subdivided into the Opu, who live upstream of the Tapanahony River in the Tapanahony resort of southeastern Suriname, and the Bilo, who live downstream of that river in Marowijne District Dugout canoes at Ndyuka Maroon village, Suriname River, 1955 The most important towns are Moengo, the largest town in Marowijne District, and Diitabiki (old name: Drietabbetje) which is the residence of the granman (paramount chief) of the Ndyuka people since 1950. They further subdivide themselves into twelve matrilinear kinship groups called lo. There is a thirteenth group, that of the granman.Maroon Cosmopolitics: Personhood, Creativity and Incorporation History The Ndyuka and related people are of African descent, transported as cargo by the Dutch to Suriname in the 17-18th century to work on Dutch-owned colonial plantations. Those who escaped fled deep into the rainforests where they established Maroon communities along rivers in mostly southeastern Suriname and parts of neighboring French Guiana and where their culture adopted elements of Native American cultures. It is rare for Ndyuka people to marry outside the group, \\"so they remain genetically close to their African ancestors.\\" In 1757, a large slave revolt took place at six wood plantations near the Tempati Creek. The runaway slaves joined an existing group of Maroons. The Society of Suriname was concerned about the size and strength of the group, therefore Captain Zobre was dispatched on 30 July 1759 to negotiate. Zobre returned with a temporary ceasefire agreement, and information that the tribe consisted of six villages with an estimated population of 2,000 people. The second expedition was less successful: the Ndyuka were disappointed in gifts like mirrors and said that they preferred guns and ammunition. They also wanted the presence of the plantation owners of the Jodensavanne at the negotiations. On 10 October 1760, the Ndyuka signed a treaty with the Dutch colonizers,\\"The Ndyuka Treaty Of 1760: A Conversation with Granman Gazon.\\" culturalsurvival.org recognizing territorial autonomy. 10 October is still a day celebrated among some Surinamese Maroons. =Autonomous people= From 1761, many Ndyuka gradually moved southwards from Marowijne District in order to protect themselves from the colonists, and started to build camps on the Tapanahoni River dispelling the indigenous Tiriy√≥. Slaves who had recently fled from Armina and Boven Commewijne were stationed near the confluence of the Tapanahoni and Lawa River to guard against attacks by the Aluku. In December 1791, Philip Stoelman founded a military outpost on Stoelmanseiland, thus establishing a militarised border between the Ndyuka held territory and the Colony of Suriname. Tapanahony was off-limits to white settlers, and was not explored until the beginning of the 20th century. =Trade= Even though Tapanahony was isolated and generally neglected by the government, it was not completely self-sufficient. Trade was encouraged by both sides; article 7 of the Treaty can be regarded as a free-trade agreement. Between 1880 and 1930, the Ndyuka managed to gain a near monopoly on the freight trade between Albina, Suriname and Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana in the north, and the Surinamese and French Guianese interiors in the south. In 1921, the Maroon Freighter Strike was called and lasted three months. The strike had serious economic consequences, and severely disrupted the Balat√° and gold industry in both countries. Governor van Heemstra even threatened to end the autonomy of the Ndyuka over the strike. =Development and Health Care= In 1919, a pilot project to improve agriculture, education and medical care failed, because the necessary funds were never supplied. The Ndyuka were later blamed because they resisted the imposition of taxation. On 6 May 1924, postulated in the Colonial States: \\"Economically, the Bushnegroes thus far have had little significance for the Colony, and that is not their fault, but the Dutch Government's [fault], which has neglected these people, and tolerated that today, in the 20th century, we are still talking about Bushnegroes.\\" Generally medical care was provided free for Maroons who journeyed to the coastal area. An attempt in 1913 to charge for medical care in the hospitals was ignored in practice, and later revoked by Governor , because it was better for the overall sanitary conditions. In a 1943 meeting between the Governor and the granmans the population decline in the tribal areas was discussed. The granmans talked about alarming rates of tuberculosis, malaria, and infertility. The proposed solution was to send a medical team into the tribal areas, and make people aware about the dangers of inbreeding. In 1946, Medische Zending was put in charge of the health care in tribal areas. The improved medical care resulted in a rapid population growth. =Interior War= In the late 1980s, the Surinamese Interior War was fought between the Suriname National Army and the Jungle Commando lead by Ronnie Brunswijk. The civil war resulted in a refugee crisis into French Guiana especially from the Marowijne District. Even though Brunswijk was a Ndyuka, Gaanman Gazon, the paramount chief, refused to take sides in the conflict, and maintained strict neutrality in the Tapanahony resort. On 26 May 1987, Gazon published a plea to the international community for meditation. =Current situation= Moengo (2008) In the last decades of the 20th century a large number of the Ndyuka people began moving from their ancestral villages to the coast, especially in and around Paramaribo, the country's capital. Their motivations for moving were mainly economic. As of 2014, of the estimated 90,000 Ndyukas, only 26,000 live in the tribal lands, while 30,000 live in and around Paramaribo, 21,000 in French Guiana and 7,500 in the Netherlands. On 19 August 2000, a kabiten (captain) was installed for the Ndyuka Maroon community in diaspora. In Utrecht, Andr√© R.M. Pakosie was installed as captain for the Netherlands. On 13 June 2020, Ronnie Brunswijk was elected Vice President of Suriname by acclamation in an uncontested election. He was inaugurated on 16 July as the first Maroon in Suriname to serve as vice president. Governance The Treaty of 1760 allowed the Ndyuka privileges, but also imposed restrictions like the return of runaway slaves, and in case of an external war, they must provide an army to fight with the Suriname National Army. Originally the tribe was free to settle anywhere with permission providing it was at a distance of at least ten hours from the plantations. That definition was rather vague, and in 1837, it was changed to a delimited area around the Cottica River in Marowijne District, and the Tapanahony River. The paramount chief of the Ndyuka is the granman. Below the granman are the kabitens (captains) followed by the basiyas (aldermen). The stam lanti consists of all the kabitens and basiyas who meet at least once a year under the authority of the granman and decide the policy for the entire tribe. A village has a lo lanti (council) consisting of the kabitens and basiyas of the village who are advised by a council of elders. The lo lanti acts as the local government. In case of important decisions, the whole village participates and a decision is taken on the basis of consensus. As of 1989, the resorts in the Marowijne District are governed by a Resort Council which is democratically elected at the General Election. This has caused as an overlap with lo lanti. The decentralization commission was aware of the problem in 2007, but as of 2020 the two systems exist side by side. For Tapanahony, a district commissioner is appointed to represent the Surinamese government. This is a continuation of the posthouders (post holders) which were installed after the Treaty to represent the state. In the draft agreement, there was a provision for an independent judicial system except for the crimes which could carry a death sentence. The article caused much debate, and was dropped altogether in the final agreement. In practice an independent judicial system was in operation except for people accused of major crimes who were turned over to the Suriname government. In the second half of the 20th century, the system became obsolete for criminal cases. Even though the Treaty has significant implications for Suriname, it was not mentioned in the Government Regulations of 1865 nor in the Constitution of 1936. In 1975, in preparation of the Independence of Suriname, the treaties with the Maroons were subject to much debate in both the Dutch and Surinamese parliaments, however the Maroon autonomy has not been mentioned once in both the Constitution of Suriname or the Declaration of Independence. The Treaty deals with the rights and obligations of the tribe, however the Constitution does not mention the tribe or its government, therefore if the granman says no, the issue can be pushed through, because the legal position of the granman has not been defined. Nevertheless, the treaties are still in effect. In 2005, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled on the 1986 Moiwana massacre. The court upheld the 1760 Treaty, and determined that \\"the Moiwana community members may be considered the legitimate owners of their traditional lands.\\" Lifestyle Body of Ndyuka Maroon child brought before a medicine man, Suriname River, Suriname, South America, 1955 The Milwaukee Public Museum says the following about the Ndyuka and their way of Maroon life: Religion The traditional religion of the Ndyuka was Winti, a synthesis of African religion traditions. The Marowijne District was accessible to outsiders, and the Catholic and Moravian Church founded churches and schools first in neighbouring Albina and later in the Maroon villages. Attempts to convert Tapanahony were not successful at first, until 1864 when the Moravian Church sent the Maroon missionary Johannes King to the granman. The extensive traditional funerary rites are generally practised, and Winti is a major religion, however the majority are Christians.

A single five-cylinder air-cooled R.E.P. \\"fan\\" (or \\"semi-radial\\") engine rated at 60 horsepower (45 kW) driving a two-bladed propeller was fitted in the aircraft's nose, while the aircraft had a conventional landing gear, with both wheels and skids. The wings were of wood and steel construction, with lateral control by wing-warping, with the pilot operating a joystick.Flight 26 August 1911, pp. 734‚Äì736.Andrews and Morgan 1988, p.36. The first five monoplanes were basically similar, and were powered by R.E.P engines, with the fifth one having a deeper fuselage. The sixth aircraft, built for the 1912 British Military Aeroplane Competition was noticeably different, with side-by-side seating for its two crew, a shorter wingspan (35 ft (10.67 m) rather than 47 ft 6 in (14.5 m) for the earlier aircraft), while a 70 hp (52 kW) Viale radial engine was fitted.Andrews and Morgan 1988, pp. 36‚Äì37.Flight 24 August 1912, pp. 774‚Äì775. The seventh aircraft reverted to the tandem layout and longer wingspan of the first five aircraft, but replaced the R.E.P. engine with a 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome rotary engine, while the eighth, and final example, was similar to the sixth aircraft, with a 70‚Äì80 hp Gnome rotary.Andrews and Morgan 1988, pp. 38‚Äì39.Flight 22 February 1913, pp. 223‚Äì224.  Operational history  = Great Britain = The major role for the other aircraft was as trainers at the Vickers Flying School established at Brooklands, Surrey in 1912. In this role they proved underpowered, and were difficult to fly as they lacked inherent stability.Andrews and Morgan 1988, pp. 34‚Äì35. = Antarctica = The Vickers R.E.P. in Antarctica as an air tractor. The second monoplane was sold to the Australian explorer Douglas Mawson for the Australasian Antarctic Expedition of 1911. It was badly damaged in a crash landing at Adelaide in October 1911, however, so it was taken to Antarctica without its wings to use as a tractor for sledges. It proved unsuccessful in this role as the low temperatures caused lubricating oil to solidify and the engine to seize. The airframe was abandoned at the Cape Denison base of the expedition, with parts of the aircraft being discovered in 2010.Flight 29 July 1911, p. 663.Andrews and Morgan 1988, pp. 35‚Äì36.Smith, Tanalee. \\"Remains of Early 1900s Plane Found in Antarctica\\".

Life He was trained as an attorney, but took to political writing before he was twenty. He was one of the authors in Prime Minister Robert Walpole's pay who replied to the Craftsman and the various attacks of Bolingbroke and Pulteney. He wrote the Free Briton under the signature of \\"Francis Walsingham\\", and succeeded Matthew Concanen in the British Journal. The report of the committee of inquiry into Walpole's conduct indicates that in the years 1731-41 over ¬£50,000 for his writing circle, with over ¬£10,997 allocated to Arnall for distribution to other journalists or to meet printing costs. Arnall himself received an annual pension of about ¬£400, making him the best paid government journalist in London. Works Besides his writing for Walpole, Arnall also published a number of pamphlets on political and ecclesiastical themes, including Publius Clodius Pulcher and Cicero (1727), One of his tracts, in which he disputes certain claims of the clergy in regard to tithes Animadversions on Bishop Sherlock's Remarks on the Tythe Bill, is reprinted in The Pillars of Priestcraft and Orthodoxy Shaken (2nd edn, 1768). A letter to Dr. Codex [Dr. Gibson] on His Modest Instructions to the Crown (1733), Opposition No Proof of Patriotism (1735) on Thomas Rundle's appointment to the see of Londonderry, and The Complaint of the Children of Israel (1736, under the name Solomon Abrabanel) are attributed to him.

In the London Evening Post for 3 June 1736, Arnall's death in May that year is reported. Arnall's work for Walpole made him a popular target for the Whig opposition Craftsman and Fog's Journal. He was also satirised in verse, Alexander Pope for example attacked him in the Dunciad (Bk. ii. 315), where his name was substituted for Leonard Welsted's in 1735, and in the epilogue to the Satires (Dialogue ii. 129): 'Spirit of Arnall, aid me whilst I lie!'

Life He was the son of William Aston (died 1826), gunsmith, of Deansgate, in Manchester from 1770; by 1811 William Aston & Son were gunsmiths at 53 King's Street. In October 1790 Joseph Aston married Elizabeth Preston, also of Manchester.Procter, Richard Wright (1874) Memorials of Manchester Streets. Manchester: T. Sutcliffe; p. 164-65 In 1803 he opened a stationer's shop at 84 Deansgate, where on 1 January 1805 he issued the prospectus of the Manchester Mail, published at sixpence and professing \\"no political creed\\". From 1809 till 1825 he was publisher and editor of a conservative journal, the Manchester Exchange Herald. Afterwards he moved to Rochdale, where he started the Rochdale Recorder and then retired to live at Chadderton Hall. He died at Chadderton Hall on 19 October 1844, and was buried at Tonge, adjoining Middleton. Aston was the friend and executor of Thomas Barritt, the antiquary. For about 34 years he also enjoyed the closest intimacy with James Montgomery, the poet and editor of the Sheffield Iris, who submitted to him most of his manuscripts for revision and criticism.According to R. W. Procter his correspondence with Montgomery began in 1793 and lasted 34 years. They first met in 1797 at Buxton from where they visited Castleton; they visited each other on several occasions thereafter ‚Äì Procter (1874), p. 165. In Aston's youth his political views were Liberal and favoured reform, but in later life he wrote in a Conservative spirit.Procter (1874), pp. 165‚Äì166. His wife, by whom he had children including a daughter, survived him; she died 20 July 1852.Procter (1874), pp. 172‚Äì173. He himself was a facile writer of verses, the majority of which appeared in his own paper. Of his dramatic pieces, Conscience, a comedy, was performed at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, in 1815, with moderate success; and he also wrote Retributive Justice, a tragedy, and A Family Story, a comedy. Works His published works nearly all relate to Manchester.

This film was written by Gian Paolo Callegari, directed by Alfonso Brescia and starred Richard Harrison. Plot In ancient Rome, at about 96 AD, Emperor Domitian has become a highly paranoid and tyrannical despot who keeps the people oppressed in constant fear of a revolt. He has only a few retainers left whom he perceives as loyal: his lover Artamne, a scheming Egyptian priestess of Isis; his diminutive jester, Elpidion; his gladiator bodyguards under the command of Soterus; his palace guards; and his Imperial Praetorian Guard under the command of their centurion, Valerius Rufus. Anyone who dares speak up against the Emperor - and may it be only a minor complaint - or is suspected of treason is either imprisoned or summarily executed. Although Valerius appears loyal, he secretly harbors resentment against the tyrant, but is careful not to reveal it. He begins fighting Domitian's rule in a masked identity; when he begins to use a red wolf's coat to hide his face, he becomes known as the \\"Red Wolf\\". Among his allies are the young senator Nerva and the old patrician Fabius Lucillius and his family, especially Fabius' daughter Lucilla, Valerius' love interest. One day, Artamne persuades Domitian to hold a sacrificial celebration in the Imperial palace, forcing Lucilla and other patrician daughters to attend and to be subjected to exploitation by the Emperor's lust. Valerius manages to prevent this, but as he hides his mask in a secret cache in the palace garden, he is spotted by Elpidion. The next day, Valerius arranges for Lucilla, the other girls and the fugitives he has rescued to flee to Lucillius' country estate. When he returns to his quarters, he discovers Elpidion, clad in his wolfpelt mask, waiting for him, but the dwarf declares that he, too, hates Domitian and wants to join his cause. He tells of Domitian and Artamne's plan to arrest and execute all patricians suspected of treason, and Valerius, as the Red Wolf, arrives just in time to help his friends escape to Lucillius' estate. The fugitives finally decide to organize an armed resistance movement, and Valerius kidnaps Artamne as a hostage. But in time, Artamne manages to charm one of her guards into releasing her; she returns to Domitian and reveals the location of the rebels' hideout. Domitian sends out Soterus and his gladiators to eliminate the rebels. Valerius, alerted by Elpidion, fights them, allowing his friends to escape, but is wounded in the arm and Lucilla is captured. While Valerius manages to temporarily hide his secret by putting his mask onto one of his killed friends, Soterus notices the injury and exposes him. Valerius manages to escape, but as he later tries to free Lucilla from captivity, he is captured himself and both are sentenced to death. In the dungeons, however, Valerius is approached by his loyal friend and subordinate in the guard, Sejanus, who reveals that the Praetorian Guards are also resentful of Domitian's tyranny and wish to overthrow him. Valerius sends him to contact his fugitive friends, and together with a group of disgruntled travelling artists the rebels prepare to free the two and overthrow Domitian when Valerius and Lucilla are to be executed in the palace garden the following night. With Elpidion's aid, the rebel's main group enters the palace through the dungeons and takes the Emperor and his retinue by surprise. Artamne and Soterus are killed in the struggle, and with the appearance of the Praetorian Guardsmen, the battle is quickly ended. Domitian makes it as far as his throne room with Lucilla as his hostage, but Valerius follows him and kills him in the ensuing duel, ending his tyranny.

Formed in 2000, the collective's membership has undergone a number of changes. Its most active members have included Cecilia Berkovic, Jinhan Ko, Kelly Lycan, Jenifer Papararo, and Khan Lee.  Artistic approach  Instant Coffee uses the format of the art exhibition as a framework for its practice. Precedents include the 1960s art events known as Happenings, \\"a performance, event or situation meant to be considered art.\\" As with the Happening, Instant Coffee stages events that \\"bring artists, writers and musicians together in combinations rarely encountered elsewhere.\\" However, Instant Coffee updates this idea by designating their activities as \\"service-oriented.\\" The use of corporate-style language is deliberate and is an aspect of the collective‚Äôs creation of a strong brand identity. Instant Coffee establishes its brand through the use of a specific graphic style on their website, event invitations, posters, publications and related ephemera. As a further expression of their brand, the collective uses a consistent, self-reflective and ironic, tone in all written communications. For instance, the tagline \\"Instant Coffee: it doesn't have to be good to be meaningful\\", plays on the collective‚Äôs real world namesake, fake coffee, while promoting their utopian belief in inclusiveness, as opposed to more traditional artworld modes of selection and exclusion. Like all brands, Instant Coffee has worked hard to ensure certain ideas are associated with its name. The Instant Coffee brand evokes feelings of conviviality; it‚Äôs self-aware but fun. This brand identity is the result of collective‚Äôs consistent production of art-related events in which the distinction between artwork and audience is blurred. This strong emphasis on the social aspect of art connects Instant Coffee to the broader artworld trend of relational aesthetics. Often an Instant Coffee event consists of works made in a single format that flies below the radar of medium specificity, such as the bumper sticker or stencil, to allow a broad range of artists, and the artistically-inclined, to participate. The Urban Disco Trailer, a retrofitted camping trailer, was an early platform used to present artworks in this mode. In more recent projects, the collective has focused on creating a participatory environment for its audience. The Instant Coffee Bass-Bed, contained a subwoofer connected to a sound system that made the bed vibrate. Instant Coffee‚Äôs Nooks created four moveable replicas of a kitchen nook, complete with window, inside of which audiences could sit and enjoy a series of art-related events. An ongoing project, the Light Bar reconstructs the gallery as a bar complete with full spectrum light therapy units to fight Seasonal affective disorder.

The present parish is a compact area centered on Upper Street between Angel and Highbury Corner, bounded to the west by Liverpool Road, and to the east by Essex Road/Canonbury Road. The church is a Grade II listed building. The churchyard was enlarged in 1793. With the rapid growth of Islington, it became full and closed for burials in 1853. It was laid out as a public garden of one and a half acres in 1885.T F T Baker, C R Elrington (Editors), A P Baggs, Diane K Bolton, Patricia E C Croot, A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 8,1985. History =Pre- Reformation= The first recorded church building was erected in the twelfth century and was replaced in the fifteenth century.John Richardson, Islington Past, Revised Edition, Historical Publications Limited, 2000;pp 59-60. Before his consecration as Bishop of St David's in 1509, Edward Vaughan served as vicar.Table: Vicars of Islington in St Mary's Islington, Pamphlet published for the church rebuilding appeal, 1949. Robert Browne, who authored the founding principles of Congregationalism, served as lecturer at St Mary's until around 1578. =17th century= John Webster the Elizabethan dramatist, married his heavily pregnant 17-year-old second wife, Sara Peniall, at St Mary's in Lent 1606, by special licence.Rene Weis, editor of John Webster: The Duchess of Malfi and Other Plays (Oxford World's Classics, 1996) in programme notes for The Duchess of Malfi, The Old Vic, Spring 2012 William Cave became vicar in 1662, at the age of twenty-five, and held the office until 1689. He was subsequently buried at the church, having died in Isleworth in 1713. =18th century= On 24 July 1738, the Vicar of St Mary's, George Stonehouse, invited Charles Wesley to \\"take charge of his parish, under him, as his Curate.\\"Charles Wesley, The Journal of Charles Wesley 1707-1788, 1738 http://wesley.nnu.edu/charles-wesley/the-journal-of-charles- wesley-1707-1788/the-journal-of-charles-wesley-january-5-april-30-1738 He did not, however, possess any licence to do so from the Bishop of London. Wesley's journal lists many occasions on which he preached, and his regular praying at the church. Wesley's preaching proved unpopular for some and within a year he and George Whitefield were expelled from the pulpit at St Mary's. On 27 April 1739 he noted, \\"At Islington vestry the Churchwardens forbad my preaching: demanded my local licence. I said nothing but that \\"I heard them.\\" Scions was very abusive; bidding me shake off the dust of my feet, &c.; and said, \\"You have all the spirit of the devil,\\" mentioning Mr. Whitefield, Stonehouse, and me by name.\\" From this point on Wesley joined his brother John and George Whitefield in field-preaching. Following a series of meetings with the Bishop of London, he decided to leave the city and to join his brother in Bristol during August 1739. The church fell into \\"very ruinous condition\\" and the Islington Church Act 1750 was passed to enable it to be rebuilt. The new building was consecrated on 26 May 1754, designed by Lancelot Dowbiggin. In this period, the church leadership began to establish ties to African leaders. In 1759, Philip Quaque, son of the Fante king Birempong Cudjo, was baptised at St Mary's, after having attended the church with his brother for four years. He became the first black African to be ordained as a priest in the Church of England and returned to Ghana to minister as a missionary. Richard Smith, a West India merchant, purchased the advowson for St Mary in 1771. His eldest son, also Richard Smith(1739‚Äì1772), became Rector of Islington.Judith Phillips Stanton. The Collected Letters of Charlotte Smith. Indiana University Press. p. xlvii. . =19th century= The Revd Daniel Wilson (1778-1858), served as vicar from 1824 until 1832, when he became Bishop of Calcutta. In 1831 he was one of the founders of the Lord's Day Observance Society. The Islington Clerical Conference, founded by Daniel Wilson, ran from 1827-1983 and was held at St Mary's. (endnote 3) Wilson's son, also Daniel, served as vicar of the church for fifty-four years, during which time many new parishes were created as the population of Islington soared.James Hewitt, Essay: Islington Parish Church - a short history in St Mary's Islington, Pamphlet published for the church rebuilding appeal, 1949. The young Samuel Ajayi Crowther was sent to Islington from Sierra Leone in 1826 to study at the church's school and attend services. He later was ordained as a minister by the Bishop of London, and served in West Africa, later becoming the first African Bishop in Nigeria. He also became a noted linguist, publishing a Yoruban grammar and a translation of the Book of Common Prayer in Yoruba. He returned to Islington several times and ordained his own son, Dandeson Crowther, in St Mary's Church in 1870.Jacob Oluwatayo Adeuyan, The Journey of the First Black Bishop, AuthorHouse, 2011. William Hagger Barlow became vicar on the death of Daniel Wilson the second. He built the Bishop Wilson Memorial Hall (subsequently renovated for use as St Mary's Neighbourhood Centre) and the vicarage, which is still in use. =20th century= An extensive portico of Portland stone was built at the west door in 1904, to a design of Sir Reginald Blomfield. It includes a relief of the Nativity.Brian Vermeulen, Quinquennial inspection report of St Mary's Church 1999 Donald Coggan, later Archbishop of Canterbury, served as curate from 1934‚Äì1937. David Sheppard, later Bishop of Liverpool, played cricket for England while an assistant curate at Islington, 1955‚Äì7. On the third night of the London Blitz, at 10.20pm on 9 September 1940, a bomb destroyed the majority of the church, leaving only the tower and spire intact.History of St Mary's Church Main-altar reredos mural by Brian ThomasThe church was rebuilt following an appeal by the incumbent, The Revd Hugh Gough, and dedicated in 1956 when Maurice Wood was vicar.

The main worship space is vast, with a volume of over 5000 cubic metres, and features deep clear windows that allow an unusually high amount of more natural light. The east and west ends have murals by Brian Thomas. The original church's lectern, baptismal font and Royal Arms all survived the bombing. They are visible within the church.Information leaflet available at the church. In 1962, George Carey became curate and, among other innovations, made connections with local council departments and founded a new Boy's Club.George Carey, Know the Truth, Harper Collins, 2004. In 1967, with the support of Revd Johnson, brothers Dr Majeeb Chowdhry, Najeeb Chowdhry, Waheeb Chowdhry and their friend Emmanuel Din started the first Asian Christian Church in the UK, at St Mary's Church. Revd Daniel Gill became the first Pakistani minister to lead an Urdu service in the UK, although he was not an ordained minister in the Church of England. This British Pakistani church inspired the growth of similar 'Urdu Fellowships' across London and eventually the UK. As many Pakistani Christians have moved to less expensive areas of London, the Urdu fellowship ended in the 1990s. St Mary's role in British Evangelicalism waned, as the Islington Clerical Conference (of which the vicar had been ex-officio president) ended in 1983. =21st century= In 2003, vicar Graham Kings and others founded Fulcrum, which seeks to renew the evangelical tradition at the centre of the Church of England. From the 1990s, as Islington became a more fashionable place to live and Upper Street developed a significant nightlife, St Mary's retained a concern to serve the widening range of people in the locality. The crypt beneath the church was radically transformed with an innovative regeneration programme. In 2009, the St Mary Islington Community Partnership was formed to deliver and expand the range of community services that take place in the crypt and neighbourhood centre. Worship Worship services take place at St Mary's most days of the week. On Sundays, the main act of worship is the 11am service. A quieter evening service begins at 6pm. The Book of Common Prayer is used for a service of Holy Communion at 9am once per month. A daily morning prayer meeting takes place at 9.30am on weekdays and Saturdays.

He was educated at Gravesend Grammar School, and earned a BMus degree with top honors from the University of Bristol. Schubert's Eighth Symphony The first two movements of Schubert's Eighth or \\"Unfinished\\" Symphony, an Allegro moderato in B minor and an Andante con moto in E major, completed in the Autumn of 1822, were sequestered by Anselm H√ºttenbrenner in Graz after Schubert had sent them to him in full score in fulfillment of a commission by the Graz musical society. They were not discovered and conducted by Johann Herbeck until 1865, when he visited the aging H√ºttenbrenner and persuaded him to show him, and lend him, the MS of the legendary rumored missing Schubert B minor Symphony in return for promising to conduct a still unperformed overture of H√ºttenbrenner's. The last pages of the Schubert MS contained a sketch of the projected third movement (a scherzo in B major with trio in G major) ultimately completed by Newbould by (1) simply orchestrating the scherzo proper, completed by Schubert in short score, (2) harmonizing and orchestrating the first strain of the trio of which Schubert had written out only the unharmonized melodic line, (3) conjecturally composing the second strain of the trio, entirely missing in the MS, in the Schubert style with contrasting material followed by a return of the theme of the first strain adding slight embellishments in the Schubert manner, and (4) proposing that the large-scale B minor first entr'acte of the Rosamunde incidental music composed several months later in early 1823 by Schubert be played as the likely intended finale of the B minor Symphony since it matched the first movement, and the sketch of the scherzo, in key and style and was composed shortly afterward. Schubert's Tenth Symphony Newbould went on to unravel, piece together and orchestrate (following the composer's few notations for intended instruments) Schubert's Tenth Symphony from unsequenced but nearly complete rough MS drafts for a lyrical sonata-form first movement in D major, a monumentally heroic slow movement in B minor and a sonata-form finale in D major dated by him (by the water-marks of the MS paper and by interspersed counterpoint exercises most likely as homework for the one lesson Schubert was able to take from illustrious private teacher Simon Sechter, who subsequently taught the young Anton Bruckner, before Schubert succumbed to typhus on November 19 a few weeks later) as most probably composed in fall 1828 as his last symphonic work, to be followed only by the song with clarinet obligato, \\"Der Hirt auf dem Felsen.\\" Newbould also produced a conjectural completion of Schubert's fragmentary Symphony No. 7 in E major. Both Sir Charles Mackerras and Sir Neville Marriner have conducted recorded performances of Newbould's conjectural completions of these Schubert \\"unfinished symphonies\\".

It develops and manufactures recombinant spider silks and other high-performance polymers using spider silk gene sequences. Kraig Labs holds intellectual property on various spider silk technologies, including exclusive global license agreements with US universities for patented core technologies and has a proprietary production process for their recombinant spider silks. Its flagship fiber is Dragon Silk‚Ñ¢ which has been demonstrated to be tougher than many fibers used in bullet proof vests. In the fall of 2019, the company‚Äôs wholly owned subsidiary Prodigy Textiles LLC established a 45,000 sq ft production facility in Vietnam for the production of spider silk. History Kim Kraig Thompson invented the protein expression platform in 2002, which would become the basis for Kraig Lab‚Äôs work with spider silk. Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. was then founded by Kim Thompson in April 2006 to develop and commercialize spider silks and other high performance polymers gene and sequences using platform technology in combination with genetic engineering concepts personally developed by Kim Thompson. Kraig Labs has successfully created numerous (approximately 20 by 2010) transgenic silkworm variants expressing different properties derived from the spider silk proteins. The original scientific work to reduce Mr. Thompson‚Äôs invention to practice was performed in the biological laboratories of the University of Notre Dame. University laboratories were chosen because the Company, in its early stage, lacked adequate financing to establish a private laboratory and hire molecular biologists of the caliber required for the work. Mr. Thompson negotiated an agreement with the University under which the Company brought its basic designs to the University and paid for lab time in exchange for an exclusive global license on the technology developed. The University of Notre Dame was chosen in large part because the co-inventor of the PiggyBac transposon system, Dr. Malcom Fraser was in residence there. This transposon was utilized by Kraig Labs and the University of Notre Dame to create the world‚Äôs first transgenic silkworm producing recombinant spider silk. This work was subsequently the subject of a peer review article in the Publication of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The Science The Company's production platform is based upon genetic modification of the domesticated silk worm (Bombyx mori). In interviews, the Company‚Äôs founder has stated that this decision was based largely on economics and the practicality of production. By utilizing the silkworm as the basis of production, the Company is able to produce the desired spider silk protein and have the silkworm spin it into a continuous fiber. Each individual transgenic silkworm produces one continuous fiber approximately one Kilometer in length. In 2020, Kraig Labs successfully developed a significantly more advanced technology platform. The new platform technology utilized a non-CRISPR gene editing, large plasmid knock-in knock- out technology. The new platform allows for the creation of essentially pure spider silk. Other than the silkworm‚Äôs remaining specifically desired native silk protein elements, Kraig Labs is now able to produce nearly pure spider silk. This is also an eco-friendlier and cost-effective silkworm production system, which is significantly more advanced than any of the competing methods. The knock-in knock-out technology allows Kraig Labs to work with very complex protein sequences in the silkworms, which are about four times more complex than published technologies. The Company‚Äôs Generation III Spider Silk Technology is purposed for specific customization. Kraig Labs originally used the PiggyBac Transposon plasmid vector that was developed in collaboration with the University of Notre Dame. In all methods, specific sequences of spider DNA are inserted into the genetic makeup of the silkworm to create a silkworm that produces spider silk. That transgenic silkworm is then used as the basis for establishing a genetic line silkworms that also produce spider silk. Kriag Biocraft is able to customize the sequences that it inserts into the silkworm, thus giving them the ability to customize the resulting silk thread‚Äôs strength, flexibility and possibly other properties. Spider Silk Applications Silk with strength equaling native spider silk has potential applications such as: car airbags, bulletproof vests, seat belts, parachutes, nets, and sporting goods and sporting apparel. There are also numerous medical applications for the recombinant silk. Potential uses in the medical industry are bandages that have the ability to reduce scarring versus using traditional bandages. The silk could even be used as a scaffolding material for artificial tendon and ligament repair.

There were three classes of admirals and differentiated by using coloured flags.. In 1620 the official Flag ranks of Admiral, Vice Admiral, and Rear Admiral were legally established that arose directly out of the organisation of the fleet into three parts. The rank of Admiral of the Fleet was formally introduced in 1688. The Vice-Admiral of the Red was a senior rank of the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom, immediately outranked by the rank Admiral of the Blue (see order of precedence below). Royal Navy officers currently holding the ranks of commodore, rear admiral, vice admiral and admiral of the fleet are sometimes considered generically to be admirals. From 1688 to 1805 this rank was in order of precedence fourth; after 1805 it was the fifth. In 1864 it was abolished as a promotional rank. Order of precedence Admirals of the Colour The Navy was divided into three squadrons Red, White and Blue in order of seniority. Admirals were appointed to these squadrons and therefore their rank and squadron split the seniority originally into 9 bands then later 10 with ‚ÄòAdmiral of the Fleet' as senior to all others.. Seniority was therefore from 1805 to 1864: # Admiral of the Fleet # Admiral of the Red Squadron (rank created in 1805) # Admiral of the White Squadron # Admiral of the Blue Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the Red Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the White Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the Blue Squadron # Rear- Admiral of the Red Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the White Squadron # Rear- Admiral of the Blue Squadron Seniority was therefore from 1688 to 1805: # Admiral of the Fleet, (rank created in 1688) # Admiral of the White Squadron # Admiral of the Blue Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the Red Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the White Squadron # Vice-Admiral of the Blue Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the Red Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the White Squadron # Rear-Admiral of the Blue Squadron Admirals without an appointment were colloquially referred to as Yellow Admirals. Ships of the Royal Navy flew the Ensign that coincided with the squadron of their commanding officer.

It is traditionally made from minced tenggiri (wahoo) fish meat, although other types of seafood such as tuna, mackerel, and prawn may also be used. The fish paste is subsequently stuffed into wonton skins or filled into tofu, and then deep fried in palm oil. Street-side batagor fried dumplings are usually served with fried tofu and finger-shaped fried otak-otak fish cakes. These batagor components are cut into bite-size pieces and topped with peanut sauce, Kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), sambal (chili paste), and lime juice. As a fried food, batagor generally have a crispy and crunchy texture; since the serving method is identical, batagor and siomay are often sold by the same vendor, with batagor being offered as a crispy variation of siomay. History and origin Batagor is ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, and can be found in street-side food stalls, travelling carts, bicycle vendors, and restaurants. However, it is most strongly associated with the West Javan city of Bandung. The dish is influenced by Chinese Indonesian cuisine, and might be derived from siomay, with the main difference being that batagor is fried instead of steamed. It has been readily adapted into local Sundanese cuisine, and today, most batagor sellers are Sundanese. Batagor began appearing in various Indonesian cities throughout the country in the 1980s, and is believed to have been invented in 1968 in Bandung. According to legend, batagor was created as a way to salvage unsold bakso meatballs. It is said that one day the bakso did not sell well, and a seller was stuck with too many leftovers. In order to cut his losses, he then came up with the idea to grind the meatballs, stuff them into tofu, deep fry them, and serve them with peanut sauce in a fashion similar to siomay. This created a new dish of bakso tahu goreng (\\"fried bakso [and] tofu\\"), abbreviated as \\"batagor\\". Varieties bakso Malang Batagor is traditionally served with peanut sauce, although in Bandung, most batagor sellers also offer a variant served in clear broth, batagor kuah (\\"batagor soup\\"). The soup can be made by boiling chicken broth and adding various ingredients such as pepper, sugar, salt, leek, and celery. Chili sauce, tomato sauce, and lime can also be added to bring more flavor into the soup. Batagor is popular for its savory flavor, crispy texture of its deep fried wonton skin and tofu, and its sweet and savoury peanut sauce. The typical price of batagor is fairly affordable, with a plate of modest street-side batagor costing around 10,000 Indonesian rupiah, less than one US dollar, as of 2018.

He was president of History department on Munich University, specialist for history of European Orient and history of Albanians. In his 1942 work he published the controversial thesis in which he traced the origin of Albanians back to the region of Mat. Stadtm√ºller and later Stavro Skendi supported the controversial assertion about crypto-religious groups existing in the Balkans in all places where the population converted to Islam. Stadtm√ºller founded the Albanian Institute in Munich, Germany, in 1963. Stadtm√ºller is the author of hypothesis that Mat valley was summer pasturage for early Albanians. According to this hypothesis Albanian language does not have loan words for flora and fauna found above 900m because this valley is situated in more than 1,000 m altitude and surrounded by mountains, admitting that flora and fauna found in lower ranges have loanwords originating in Slavic languages. (1) Stadtmuller's (1966) hypothesis that the mountains surrounding the Mat valley, with 1000-2000 m elevation, provided the summer pasturage of the early Albanians, whose lexicon is free of borrowings for the flora & fauna found above 900 m & admits Slavic loanwords in the 600-900 m range.

He held many important posts during his time in the Navy, including Director of the Office of Naval Intelligence, Naval attach√© to Kaiser Wilhelm II, and aid for naval personnel. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he participated in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, after which he commanded a number of ships. In 1913, he was forced into retirement after not having spent a large enough portion of his service at sea. This forced retirement sparked outrage from many, and led to letters and marches of protest. A United States Senator even introduced a bill in Congress to have him re-instated. Though these efforts all ultimately failed, they led to greater scrutiny of the retirement board. As governor, he forbade the men under his command to marry native Chamorro women and increased funding to fight disease on Guam. Life Potts was born on November 1, 1855 in Washington, D.C.. He received his education in the Washington area private school system. He married Anna Powers Cash on February 6, 1883, with whom he produced a son, Templin Morris Powers Potts. On May 10, 1902, Potts married Alden Brown in a civil ceremony in Berlin. He died on March 22, 1927 in Pasadena, California. Naval career Potts attended the United States Naval Academy and, entering on June 6, 1872 and graduating on June 20, 1876. In 1877, he served aboard as a midshipman.

He served as commanding officer of and of in 1908. That same year, he obtained the rank of Captain. From December 17, 1909 to January 25, 1912, Potts was Director of the Office of Naval Intelligence. In 1911, he acted as the official United States representative for the reception of Japanese Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç. Soon after, he became Navy aid for personnel. From 1912 to July 2, 1913, he commanded . After this command, Potts was forced into retirement. The Captain had passed his examination for rear admiral, but had been let go nonetheless, as he had not spent at least half of his time as captain at sea. His case drew national attention after he saved Louisiana from flooding following a valve blowout in the ship's starboard engine room that left a hole in the ship's hull. He consulted his lawyers about the possibility of reinstatement, and a group of sailors protested the forced retirement through demonstrations and letter-writing, and a Senator even introduced a bill in Congress to reinstate him with the rank of Rear Admiral. Despite the criticism, the Navy did not reinstate him. Governorship Potts served as Governor of Guam from December 3, 1906 to October 3, 1907. Potts sought to separate whites from the native Chamorro population by denouncing interracial marriage, calling it \\"degenerating to the whites\\", and threatened to forcibly discharge any military man who married a native Guamanian woman. He successfully obtained additional funding from Congress to combat outbreaks of leprosy and yaws on the island.

The episode was directed by Matt Shakman and written by Bill Callahan and series star James Roday. It originally aired December 1, 2010. The episode is a homage to the cult television series Twin Peaks and features seven cast members of the series: Sherilyn Fenn, Sheryl Lee, Dana Ashbrook, Robyn Lively, Lenny Von Dohlen, Catherine E. Coulson, and Ray Wise. After receiving an e-mail inviting them to a cinnamon festival, Shawn Spencer (Roday) and Burton \\"Gus\\" Guster (Dul√© Hill) travel to the quirky small town of Dual Spires. Once there, they are caught up in the mysterious drowning death of teenager Paula Merral. \\"Dual Spires\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. According to the Nielsen ratings system, it drew 3.543 million viewers, with a 2.2/4 share among all households and a 1.3/4 share among those aged 18‚Äì49. Plot After receiving a flier by email inviting them to a cinnamon festival, private detectives Shawn Spencer (James Roday) and Burton \\"Gus\\" Guster (Dul√© Hill) travel to the quirky small town of Dual Spires. Shawn and Gus eat cinnamon pie at the Sawmill Diner, an establishment owned by Robert \\"Bob\\" Barker (Dana Ashbrook) and his wife Michelle (Robyn Lively) and built on a sawmill that burned down in 1958, killing eight people. Soon, the body of Bob and Michelle's niece, Paula Merral (an anagram of Laura Palmer, the Twin Peaks murder victim), is found by a lake. Sheriff Andrew Jackson (Lenny Von Dohlen) rules the death an accident, but Shawn receives the Dewey Decimal Classification number of a book, Reincarnation and Rebirth, the title of which parallels the revelation that Paula had supposedly drowned in Santa Barbara, California seven years earlier, though her body was never found. Bob reveals that Michelle's unstable sister Lucy left Dual Spires, taking with her Paula, whom Michelle and Bob had all but raised. When Paula sent them a letter detailing the drug use and child abuse, they helped Paula fake her death so she could leave Lucy. Detectives Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) reopen the case and leave to issue a warrant for Bob's arrest. Shawn and Gus continue the investigation and, finding an entry in Paula's diary about meetings with \\"J\\", are led to partially blind photographer Jack Smith (Ryan McDonald). Jack reveals a photograph of Sheriff Jackson's son Randy (Scott Lyster), taken just before Jack was attacked during a walk with Paula. Randy reveals that after he attacked Jack, Paula confronted him about his ex-girlfriend, who Shawn deduces is librarian Maudette Hornsby (Sherilyn Fenn). However, Hornsby is found hanged at the library, and Sheriff Jackson and Dr. Donna \\"Doc\\" Gooden (Sheryl Lee) rule that Maudette killed Paula out of jealousy and committed suicide to keep the town from knowing about the affair. Shawn, however, deduces that Maudette was the one that led them to the festival and left clues for them to decode. Suddenly, Shawn and Gus are locked in the library and it is lit on fire, but they are rescued by Father Peter Westley (Ray Wise). Bob, who is revealed to be Paula's biological father, explains that after World War I, his great-grandfather established the town with two other soldiers, intending to create a secluded utopia. After the sawmill fire in 1958, the town began to look at all outsiders as a threat. When Doc Gooden and Sheriff Jackson enter and hold him at gunpoint, Shawn deduces that they are the leaders of the other two founding families. Due to Gooden's infertility and Jackson's terminal cancer, Randy was the only known direct descendant and therefore the sole future leader. To stop Randy from leaving town with a paranoid Paula, the sheriff and doctor drowned her. After Lassiter and O'Hara arrive and arrest Gooden and Jackson, the group celebrates at the diner, only to be repulsed by a number of oddities referencing Twin Peaks. Production Series star James Roday co-wrote \\"Dual Spires\\", calling Twin Peaks his favorite series of all time. \\"Dual Spires\\" was the fourth episode directed by Matt Shakman, the sixth to be written by producer Bill Callahan, and sixth to be written by series star James Roday. It originally aired in the United States on December 1, 2010, on USA Network as the 12th episode of Psych fifth season and the 75th episode overall. It was an extended episode, at 67 minutes including commercials or 50 without. According to trivia on the \\"Dual Spires enhanced\\" video at the Psych website, a Twin Peaks tribute episode had been in the works since season one. Maggie Lawson was the one who suggested the episode's title, a play on that of the original series. The episode aired 20 years to the day after the 16th episode of Twin Peaks, which answered the question of who killed Laura Palmer, after which, Mike Hale of The New York Times wrote, \\"there was really no reason to keep watching.\\" The episode features seven Twin Peaks cast members as guest stars. Sherilyn Fenn, who is best known for portraying Audrey Horne, guest stars as Maudette Hornsby. Sheryl Lee, who played Laura Palmer and Maddy Ferguson, guest stars as Dr. Donna \\"Doc\\" Gooden, Dual Spires' psychiatrist, pediatrician, optometrist, gastrologist, podiatrist, dermatologist, orthodontist, forensic scientist, veterinarian, lawyer, and accountant. Dana Ashbrook, who played Bobby Briggs, guest stars as Robert \\"Bob\\" Barker. Robyn Lively, who played Lana Budding Milford, guest stars as Michelle Barker. Lenny Von Dohlen, who played Harold Smith, guest stars as Sheriff Andrew Jackson. Catherine E. Coulson, who played the Log Lady, Margaret Lanterman, cameos as a woman carrying wood. Finally, Ray Wise, who played Leland Palmer, reprises his Psych role as Father Peter Westley. Michael Ontkean, who played Sheriff Harry S. Truman, and M√§dchen Amick, who played diner waitress Shelly Johnson, were also approached to appear in the episode. Twin Peaks co-creator David Lynch was originally going to guest star in a speaking role as Mayor Douglas Fir, but Lynch was not asked due to Roday's concern over what Lynch would think of the episode. Other guest stars include Scott Lyster as Randy Jackson and Ryan McDonald as Jack Smith. Additionally, Julee Cruise, who recorded the theme for Twin Peaks, recorded a slower, extended version of the Psych theme song, \\"I Know You Know\\" by series creator Steve Franks's band The Friendly Indians. The imagery that accompanies it is an almost shot-for-shot recreation of the Twin Peaks opening sequence, with a white horse that resembles the one in Sarah Palmer's vision before the attack on Maddy Ferguson. Later, during a bicycle chase scene, \\"Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing\\" by Chris Isaak is heard. Isaak portrayed Special Agent Chester Desmond in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. Cultural references =Allusions to Twin Peaks= Twin Peaks co-creator David Lynch was originally scheduled to guest star in the episode. \\"Dual Spires\\" is presented as an homage to Twin Peaks, and CNN writer Katie McLaughlin noted several allusions the episode makes to the series. In the beginning of the episode, there is a chocolate bunny on Shawn's desk. In Twin Peaks, Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) delivered the famous line \\"Diane, I'm holding in my hands a small box of chocolate bunnies.\\" Gus then asks, \\"Since when is the sound of opening and closing shades so disruptive that it needs to be alleviated?\\" The character Nadine Hurley in Twin Peaks attempted to patent her silent drape runner invention. Someone from a website by the name of UnderTheNail.com sends Shawn and Gus an e-mail that says, \\"Who killed Paula Merral?\\" Twin Peaks famed the catchphrase \\"Who Killed Laura Palmer?\\" The killer also purposely placed clues in his victims' fingernail beds. The victim's name itself is an anagram of \\"Laura Palmer\\". The \\"enhanced\\" video states that there are 724 references to Twin Peaks in the episode's closing scene. Among them, Jack Smith wears an eye patch and a red suit and dances funny, referencing not only the aforementioned \\"One Eyes Jacks\\" brothel and Nadine Hurley, but a dream sequence in Peaks, where a character known as the Man from Another Place wore a similar suit and danced in a bizarre fashion. In the final scene Carlton is seen holding his hand up and stating \\"that is a damn fine cup of cider\\". In the Twin Peaks pilot Agent Cooper holds his hand the same way and states \\"that is a damn fine cup of coffee.\\" Additionally, Carlton is later holding a cup of coffee on its side, displaying that the coffee is now solid in a fashion mimicking the same action by Agent Cooper in the final episode. A seven-foot tall man (John DeSantis) wearing a bow tie looks much like the giant from Agent Cooper's dream. Randy is seen at the end barking out the window like Bobby Briggs did to James Hurley in the holding cells. Bob Barker is seen dancing with a picture just as Leland Palmer did in Twin Peaks. The episode's end credits are accompanied by soap opera- type music and a shot of Paula's prom picture; Twin Peaks credits did exactly the same thing with Laura's photo. The music is also very similar to the theme. =Other references= There are several other references in the episode. Upon seeing an African American for the first time, a child asks Gus if he is Frederick Douglass. When Shawn makes the observation that Dual Spires has \\"Bob Barker, Doc Gooden, and Randy Jackson, all living in the same inlet town with no cars, cell phones, or internet\\", Gus replies that they should pitch the concept to Mark Burnett. Shawn and Gus later ride a tandem bicycle in what Shawn likens to a racially reversed Driving Miss Daisy. Randy reveals that the town gathers every week to watch Everwood. Shawn tells Maudette that they are having a Betty Boop Night at the Roadhouse. Reception According to the Nielsen ratings system, \\"Dual Spires\\" drew 3.543 million viewers, with a 2.2/4 share among all households, meaning that in the United States the episode was tuned into by roughly 2.2 percent of all television-equipped households and 4 percent of households watching television. The episode had a 1.3/4 share among those aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received positive reviews from critics familiar with Twin Peaks. Jonah Krakow of IGN gave the episode a score of 9 out of 10, writing that it was \\"enjoyable enough on its own merits that I don't have to apologize for gushing over every single subtle nod to Twin Peaks.\\" Although CNN's Katie McLaughlin was initially worried, her fears were quickly alleviated. McLaughlin stated that Psych did a \\"damn fine\\" tribute episode, and that she had fun finding all of the Twin Peaks references. Simon Abrams of The A.V. Club gave the episode a rating of C- on a scale of A+ to F. Commenting on reports that the episode has been in the works since the series' first season, Abrams wrote, \\"[it] speaks to how patently unnecessary \\"Dual Spires\\" is conceptually but also how potentially endearing it could be, too.\\" JT Vaughn of Zap2it, however, gave the episode an A+ rating, writing, \\"It was just an absolutely brilliant episode, one which paid a loving homage to a classic television show while also being a damn fine episode in itself. Psych has been in great form since it returned, and long may it continue.\\" In contrast, Starpulse writer Brittany Frederick, who was unfamiliar with Twin Peaks, enjoyed \\"Dual Spires\\" less than other episodes.

It is the third and last in a trilogy, which began with \\"An Evening with Mr. Yang\\" (3.16) and continued with \\"Mr. Yin Presents...\\" (4.16). The episode originally aired on December 22, 2010. Its title pays homage to the increasing number of film sequels to be released in 3-D. The Yin/Yang trilogy comes to a close as Shawn and Gus race to save a woman kidnapped by Mr. Yin. Only this time, they are forced to use Mr. Yang's knowledge of Yin to solve the case by allowing her to accompany them on the investigation. Plot A young woman, Allison Cowley (Mena Suvari), comes into the Santa Barbara, California police station claiming to have just escaped after being kidnapped and held by the notorious serial killer Mr. Yin. Shawn Spencer and the police are wary to believe Allison, as several others come into the station making similar claims involving the Yin case. While being questioned by Shawn and Gus, Allison describes being shackled to a radiator by Yin and shows them a bruised wrist as proof. She takes out a photograph, claiming to have grabbed it before escaping. Shawn is shocked to see a picture of himself as a child standing next to Mr. Yang (Ally Sheedy). The police accompany Allison back to where she claimed she was held. However, they find the house occupied by an innocent family. Despite Juliet's concern, Shawn still believes Allison. As protection from Yin, Shawn allows her to stay at his father Henry's house while the investigation continues. Meanwhile, the crime lab determines that it was Shawn and Yang in the picture but with a fake background, meaning the photo could have been taken anywhere. While Allison is asleep in Shawn's old bedroom at Henry's house, Henry hears a noise outside and goes to investigate. When he finds nothing, he rushes upstairs to check on Allison but finds only a yin and yang symbol painted onto the bed. With Allison missing and the clock ticking, Shawn turns to Yang for assistance on finding her partner, Yin. Yang agrees to help, but only if she is released from the psychiatric prison to visit the crime scene. They all arrive back at Henry's, who has been trying to figure out where the picture was taken and even called his ex-wife Madeleine (Cybill Shepherd) for help. Yang is thrilled to be in Shawn's old bedroom and tells him not to look for something Yin left behind this time, but to look for something he took. Shawn discovers that both The Smiths' record Meat Is Murder and Van Halen's 1984 are missing. Shawn analyses the tracks of the two albums, connecting 'The Headmaster Ritual' and 'Hot For Teacher' to lead him to Allison's teacher at school. Allison's true intentions are revealed They all race down to the college to discover there has been a substitute in the class for days. They ask the dean for information on the missing Professor Karl Rotmensen, but everything on his CV turns out to be false. Rotmensen's home address is actually an empty field, where they find VHS tapes about Yin and Yang that Mary Lightly (Jimmi Simpson) had made for Shawn before his death. In them, Mary warns that Yin will soon claim Yang as a victim because of his anger about Yang's apprehension and her newfound infamy. Meanwhile, Henry and Madeleine have tracked down their own copy of the photograph and Madeleine remembers it to be taken in front of the neighbor's house. When Henry tells Shawn, he rushes to the house with Burton \\"Gus\\" Guster to save Allison. Upon arrival, they hear a recording of Madeleine's voice calling from inside, leading them to proceed before waiting for backup. However, the door shuts behind them and they are locked inside. As the police try to enter, Juliet O'Hara enlists Yang's help as she once knew the house well. Yang agrees on the condition that she may take a new photo with Shawn. Yang leads Juliet in and promptly abandons her in the dark. Shawn and Gus come face-to-face with Yin Shawn and Gus have found Allison only to discover she is Yin's new apprentice who has lured them into a trap. Yin (Peter Weller) binds Shawn and Gus and begins filling a syringe with a lethal concoction. Yin intends to murder Gus in front of Shawn, and plans for something more \\"colorful\\" for Shawn afterwards. During this scene, Shawn and Gus bicker causing Yin to call them both \\"insufferable\\". They insist that Yin must explain all his actions in a long soliloquy before killing them, as this is the correct \\"protocol\\" for villains. Yin obliges, but just after his explanation, Yang enters, calling Yin \\"Daddy\\". Shawn and Gus discover that Yin has actually committed each of the murders attributed to Yang, forcing her to assist him for years until she finally allowed Shawn to catch her. Yang had always longed for the perfect childhood she saw Shawn enjoying as a child, which Yin insists was far from ideal as the Spencers' marriage was collapsing and Henry ignored Shawn for work. Yin tells Yang that he was always there for her. Yang asks Yin if she can \\"come home\\" and resume helping him, to which he agrees, pulling her into a fatherly embrace. However, knowing he will never change, Yang injects the syringe into Yin's chest, killing him. Meanwhile, Juliet finds Allison and attempts to take her to safety. However, Juliet becomes suspicious of Allison's contradicting lies and Allison attacks her. Juliet manages to defeat her and the SWAT team arrives. Shawn points out to Yang that she is innocent of the murders for which she was convicted, but she admits guilt for allowing Yin to continue. As she is taken back into custody, a new photograph is taken of her and Shawn, fulfilling her agreement with Juliet. Carlton Lassiter and Buzz McNab discuss the investigation at the police station, and Lassiter insists that he is unaffected. Meanwhile, Shawn and Juliet share a kiss in an interrogation room, finally safe from Yin. Lassiter walks by and witnesses this scene that he finds more horrific than the Yin/Yang investigation. Upon the realization of Shawn and Juliet's unprofessional relationship, Lassiter leaves in shock. Production The episode was originally called \\"Yin 3 in 2D,\\" but was later changed to \\"Yang 3 in 2D.\\" Mel Damski (who directed \\"An Evening with Mr. Yang\\" in 2009) returned to direct. The episode was co-written by Andy Berman (the writer of \\"An Evening with Mr. Yang\\" and \\"Mr. Yin Presents...\\") and star James Roday (who also wrote and directed \\"Mr. Yin Presents...\\"). Due to special guest star Cybill Shepherd's schedule, \\"Yang 3 in 2D\\" was forced to be filmed before many of the preceding episodes. Guest stars Ally Sheedy and Jimmi Simpson also returned as their respective characters Yang and Mary. It was later announced that Mena Suvari would make an appearance as Allison Cowley, a woman who had been kidnapped by Yin. Special guest star Peter Weller appeared as Mr. Yin. Due to the replacement of Liam James (Young Shawn) with Skyler Gisondo, the photo of Yang with Shawn had to be re-edited to include Gisondo as Young Shawn, a situation Lassiter makes light of by commenting that the photo appears photo-shopped. An error is included in the episode when Shawn, Gus, Lassiter, and Juliet are watching Mary's tapes. Shawn claims that one of the videos was filmed 2 days before Mary died (during \\"Mr. Yin Presents...\\"). The video, however, gives the date of recording as July 30, and Mary died on February 24 according to the previous installment of the trilogy. Reception As with the previous Yin/Yang installment, Jonah Krakow of IGN praised the episode. He said that, while the resolution was a bit of a let-down, it was overall a good way to end the fifth season. The episode received a rating of 8.5 out of 10 from the same website. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" width=\\"90%\\" style=\\"background-color: #EEEEEE;\\" -----  Like in the two previous season finales, I don't mind when PSYCH gets away from its unique brand of silliness, especially when they can convincingly deliver an hour of suspense and danger instead. While I felt the resolution to the story was a bit of a let-down, overall, the third chapter in the Yin/Yang story was certainly exciting and a strong way to end Season 5. } The episode was viewed by 2.90 million people (on the original airdate), which was down roughly 50 thousand viewers from the previous season finale (\\"Mr. Yin Presents...\\").http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/03/11/psych-ends-season-on-a-so- so-note/44699 References External links  Official USA Network page for \\"Yang 3 in 2D\\" Category:Psych episodes Category:2010 American television episodes ","title":"Yang 3 in 2D"},{"id":"29566605","text":"Robert Popham Spurway (16 July 1866 ‚Äì 4 December 1898) was an English cricketer who made 20 first-class appearances for Natal and Somerset County Cricket Club. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off break bowler. His best season was in 1894, when he played six times, scoring 223 at an average of 24.77. Early and military life Robert Popham, the son of the Reverend Edward Bryan Coombe Spurway, was born in Heathfield, Somerset. He attended Sherborne School from September 1877 to July 1879, then Haileybury College and played for the school's cricket team on at least one occasion. He then attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and in 1887 was gazetted first into the Worcestershire Regiment, which was cancelled later that month, and then into The Royal Scots (Lothian Regiment) as a Second Lieutenant. He was promoted from Lieutenant to Captain in March 1896, and seven months later was seconded for service in the Army Pay Department. Cricket career Spurway made his first-class debut for Natal in 1889, but had been playing cricket in South Africa for a number of years prior to that. He appeared in a number of matches for Cape Town Wanderers, and faced RG Warton's XI in 1889, the first cricket tour by an English representative team to South Africa. His debut in first-class cricket came in December 1889 against Port Elizabeth, in which he made a half-century in the first innings, top-scoring for his side with 56. He missed his next of four first-class matches, being absent with illness, and appeared twice more in first-class matches for Natal after that. He made his debut for Somerset in 1893, and reached his second half-century during that season, scoring 55 against Lancashire from number three. His best year in first-class cricket was 1894, when in six appearances he scored 223 runs at an average of 24.77. During this season, he scored his only first- class century, remaining 108 not out in Somerset's first innings against Gloucestershire, helping his side to a six wicket victory. He appeared irregularly after that season, playing twice in 1895 and once in 1898, his final first-class appearance being marked by him scoring a pair. The Spurway family had close connections with Somerset County Cricket Club; Robert's father was noted in his Wisden Cricketers' Almanack obituary as being \\"a well- known member\\" of the club, while his brother, Edward Spurway and two of his brother's sons, Francis Edward and Michael Vyvyan played first-class cricket for the county.

The station sat in the center of Main Street at the corner of Madison Street. Though there were three other stations in the city -- Prospect Street and Passaic Park to the east, and Harrison Street to the west -- the simply named Passaic station was the primary station for the city, located at grade in the busiest section of its main business street.  History  The station opened on May 28, 1832. Passaic station was rebuilt in 1883 as the main station for Passaic. It was also rebuilt in November 1954. = Passaic Plan = The site of the Passaic station in October 2013 During the 1950s and 1960s, competing priorities from agencies around the cities of Paterson and Passaic were beginning to form. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western, a competing railroad with the Erie, wanted to condense (along with the Erie) services and share trackage because of financial troubles. Secondly, the city officials in Passaic had first brought a proposal to the Erie asking about the removal of the main line through the city, which was tying up traffic in the city during station stops. This, however, was not implemented during the 1950s, as proposed. Instead, the Erie reconstructed the stations at Passaic and Clifton. Third, the New Jersey State Highway Department needed rights-of-way for Interstate 80 through Paterson and State Route 21 through Passaic. The Passaic Park station and the BE Drawbridge over the Passaic River needed to be demolished to build Route 21. After the merger on October 17, 1960, between the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Erie, the city officials in Passaic once again brought back the possibility of removing the tracks through Main Street, Passaic. This time, the newly formed Erie Lackawanna Railway went forward with it, beginning the process to move its main line onto the former Boonton Branch through Lyndhurst, Passaic and Clifton. In April 1963 the last train passed through the station. The main line was abandoned past Carlton Hill, and BE Drawbridge was swung in the open position, and soon put up for sale price of $0.00 in 1964 by the mayor of Passaic.

Located at the intersection of Getty Avenue and Clifton Avenue (County Route 611), the station served as part of the Main Line. The station consisted of tracks on an elevated line above Getty Avenue (since removed) with the 1952-built station depot on the side. After the closure of Harrison Street station, the station to the southeast was Passaic and the next station to the northwest was the Lake View station in nearby Paterson. History Clifton station was constructed in 1889 and demolished in 1969. =Passaic Plan= During the 1950s and 1960s, several different priorities from different agencies around the cities of Paterson and Passaic were beginning to form. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western, a competing railroad with the Erie, wanted to condense (along with the Erie) services and share trackage because of financial troubles. Secondly, the city officials in Passaic had first brought a proposal to the Erie asking about the removal of the main line through the city, which was tying up traffic in the city during station stops. This, however, was not implemented during the 1950s, as proposed. Instead, the Erie reconstructed the stations at Passaic and Clifton. Third, the New Jersey State Highway Department needed rights-of-way for Interstate 80 through Paterson and State Route 21 through Passaic. The Passaic Park station and the BE Drawbridge needed to be demolished to build State Route 21. After the merge on October 17, 1960, between the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Erie, the city officials in Passaic once again brought back the possibility of removing the tracks through Main Street, Passaic. This time, the newly formed Erie Lackawanna Railway went forward with it, beginning the process to move its main line onto the former Boonton Branch through Lyndhurst, Passaic and Clifton. In 1962, the state Public Utility Commission approved the removal of the tracks. In April 1963 the last train passed through the station. The main line was abandoned past Carlton Hill, and BE Drawbridge was swung in the open position, and soon put up for sale price of $0.00 in 1964 by the mayor of Passaic.

Recently however, local historian Alastair Hendry unearthed a letter referring to church rents dating prior to 1451. After retranslating the Muniments of Irvine, he dated Loudoun Kirk to 1198. At or soon after its foundation, the revenues of Loudoun Kirk, were allocated to support the monks of the newly founded Kilwinning Abbey, however they were obliged to provide a priest (curate) to attend to the spiritual needs of the parishioners. During the Campbell verus Kennedy feuds of 1527/8, Loudoun Kirk was badly damaged, but soon rebuilt. In 1530, in recognition of the shift in population, a chapel was built at Newmilns. Loudoun Kirk remained the parish church until at least the 17th century, at which time the chapel in Newmilns was upgraded to parochial status. Loudoun Kirk and its kirkyard continued in use for occasional church services, but more particularly as the last resting-place of generations of the parishioners of Loudoun.

The mill is an important footnote in the history of the textile industry in America. Stanley Woolen Mill is the centerpiece of the Central Woolen Mills District which is part of the National Historic Register. Overview Stanley Woolen Mill is located in the center of the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor at Uxbridge, a heritage corridor of national significance for America's earliest industrialization. The main factory building represents the last of a line of wooden textile mills built for mechanized manufacturing in Massachusetts and in the US. This mill helped to pioneer satinet, cashmeres, and utilized power looms, (first developed for woolens in the U.S. by John Capron from Uxbridge). Stanley Woolen had a long history of manufacturing military uniforms from the time of the American Civil War through the World Wars and including for the allied armies of Europe in World War I. \\"Beginning as Stanley Woolen Mills, the firm survived two depressions, weathering the changing times and the changing demands in the world of textiles. Over the years, the Stanley Woolen Company mills sold to such manufacturers as Evan Picone, Perry Ellis, Brooks Brothers and Hager\\". It is reported that Stanley Woolen Mill was the first US mill to completely manufacture woolen garments, mainly men's wear for the domestic market.Stanley Woolen Mill, Incorporated, 1903, A pictorial history Another tradition of this mill's long history was the blending of wool and cottons as fabrics in the manufacture of clothing. The original founding families The American Taft family first settled in what later became Uxbridge in the 17th Century. A descendant, Luke Taft became one of the earliest industrial pioneers here.) Luke Taft was the son in law of Daniel Day, and married his daughter Nancy. In 1809, Daniel Day had started the first woolen mill in Uxbridge and the Blackstone River Valley, one of the first woolen mills in the US (third), a little bit downstream. The Wheelocks, (descended from the Rev. Ralph Wheelock, the pioneer of American public education), also settled in Uxbridge, in the 18th Century. Lt. Simeon Wheelock, a Revolutionary War soldier, fought and died in Shays' Rebellion. His son Jerry, became one of the earliest textile pioneers in Uxbridge, and worked with Luke Taft. Luke and Nancy (Day) Taft had a son, Moses, who born in January 1812. Jerry Wheelock's daughter, Sylvia A Wheelock, then married Moses Taft in 1834. Luke Taft established a mill at the site in 1833, and Moses Taft, (Luke's son and Daniel Day's grandson) established what later became the larger Stanley Mill in 1852. Uxbridge was an early industrial center that played key roles in the early textile industry in America, pioneering satinets, cashmeres, blended fabrics, and power looms for woolens. Stanley Woolen Mill later would become a legacy of both the Taft and Wheelock families, continuing woolen and textile innovations of Uxbridge, begun by Jerry, Luke and their contemporaries. Stanley Woolen Mill became the first mill to offer complete vertical integration from raw materials to clothing. Stanley Woolen Mill, was a continuously operating family business, from 1833 at the present site, and from 1809, with its connections to Daniel Day. Historic significance Following the demise of the Blackstone Canal in 1847, Moses Taft, a financier and industrialist, built his Central Woolen Mill on the banks of the former Canal, in 1852.Moses Taft citation, History of Worcester County, Google Books His father, Luke Taft, had built an earlier mill here in 1833. The Central Woolen (Moses Taft) mill ran round the clock during the American Civil War. Union Blue Uniforms were made at Central Woolen. By the mid-1850s the mills of Uxbridge, were producing 2.5 million yards (2 million square meters) of cloth yearly. Some of the earliest improvements of textiles, and their industrial processes occurred in the Uxbridge Mills including Central Woolen also known as Calumet Mill. In later years, from 1903, the mill became known as Wheelock Mill or simply Stanley Woolen. In the later 20th century the mill buildings were designated as Contributing Structures to the Blackstone Canal National Historic District. While most of the mill's land was sold to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the state park, the buildings themselves continued in private hands because manufacturing continued. Tours of the working factory were intended to be a component of the Park's 'Farm to Factory' story. Integrated operation from carding through spinning, dying and weaving ended soon after the Park opened, but small specialty weaving operations continued in a portion of the mill until 1998 when the deterioration of the buildings made them unusable. (See also links for the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor). While still in full operation the factory was used in the production of several movies including Oliver's Story 1978, and The Great Gatsby 1974. An antique store and antique refinishing shop maintained occupancy in a portion of the building. From 2005-2010 the main building and the attached brick and light frame structures have been under restoration funded by private investors to prepare them for retail and office re-use. The new uses were intended to complement regional and local efforts to develop tourism and new businesses. With restoration of 419 surviving original 536 twelve-over-twelve windows and of 40 of 60 pairs of massive doors it is among the best preserved wooden structures of the old textile manufacturing era in Massachusetts.Stanley Woolen Mill by Carol Masiello; Publisher, Blackstone Daily The redevelopment has helped its preservation and had no negative environmental impacts on neighboring Federal or state parklands or the canal.Correspondence from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, pursuant to public parkland conversion requiring no environmental impact assessments. August 7, 2009 The Wheelock Family mill became known as one of the longest-running family owned textile businesses in the USA, lasting over a century. Today its Berroco Inc. yarn distribution operation is headquartered nearby and traces its roots to Jerry Wheelock and the Stanley Woolen Mill.

It is mostly vacant, yet a portion of the huge wooden buildings house a spacious antique store and is the subject of future visioning sessions by State, federal and local partnerships. In 1852, Moses Taft built the mill and leased it to Israel Southwick and Richard Sayles. During the Civil Way, 24‚Äëhour production of indigo blue uniform cloth was ongoing before the mill was sold to Robert and Jacob Taft in 1865. Soon after, they built a dam at Rice City Pond which considerably increased the water power. In 1866, an steam engine was installed and production continued to rise dramatically as the mill started producing fancy cashmeres as the name changed to the Calumet Woolen Company. Arthur and Stanley Wheelock bought the mill after 1905 and during WWI, a half million yards of khaki for the US government was produced as well as cloth for the French and Italian governments. This was the longest-running family-owned woolen mill in the US until it closed in 1988. Continuation of Berroco Handknitting Yarns Today Stanley Mill begun by the Uxbridge Wheelocks and Tafts in the 19th Century, continues under the name of Berrocco Inc, at nearby North Smithfield, RI. Stanley-Berrocco began as a subsidiary of Stanley Woolen Mill in 1968. The Berrocco Corporate site was recently at the same location as the former Scott Mill, and the original site of the Daniel Day mill of 1809, just a little bit downstream on the Blackstone River, from the Stanley Woolen Mill. Two centuries later in 2010, America's earliest textile history continues today in what is the center of the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor. Warren Wheelock, a descendant of Jerry Wheelock, leads this company today.

The author criticizes claimed evidence of the existence of innate biological differences between men and women's minds as being faulty and exaggerated, and while taking a position of agnosticism with respect to inherent differences relating to interest/skill in 'understanding the world' versus 'understanding people', reviews literature demonstrating how cultural and societal beliefs contribute to sex differences. Contents In the first part of the book, \\"'Half Changed World', Half Changed Minds\\", Fine argues that social and environmental factors strongly influence the mind, challenging a 'biology as fallback' view that, since society is equal now for the sexes, persistent inequalities must be due to biology. She also discusses the history and impact of gender stereotypes and the ways that science has been used to justify sexism. In the second part of the book, \\"Neurosexism\\", Fine criticizes the current available arguments and studies supporting sex differences in the mind, focusing on methodological weaknesses and implicit assumptions. Within neuroscientific investigations, these include small samples that give rise to unreliable, spurious results, and poorly justified 'reverse inferences' (claims of stereotype-consistent psychological differences between the sexes on the basis of brain differences). Fine also demonstrates how already weak neuroscientific conclusions are then grossly overblown by popular writers. Fine also discusses non-neuroimaging evidence cited as support for innate differences between the sexes. For example, she explains weaknesses in the work done by a student of Simon Baron-Cohen that has been widely cited (by the Gurian Institute, by Leonard Sax, by Peter Lawrence, and by Baron-Cohen himself): one-and-a-half- day-old babies were tested for preference in sequence rather than being given a choice; were tested in different viewing positions, some horizontal on their backs and some held in a parent's lap, which could affect their perception; inadequate efforts were made to ensure the sex of the subject was unknown to the tester at the time of the test; the authors assume, without justification, that newborn looking preferences are a reliable 'flag' for later social skills that are the product of a long and complex developmental process. In the third part of the book, \\"Recycling Gender\\", Fine discusses the highly gendered society in which children develop, and the contribution of that to the group identity processes that motivate children to 'self-socialize'. This challenges the common belief of parents that they tried gender-neutral parenting, but it didn't work. An overall thesis of the work is the negative impact for sex equality of neurosexism (popular or academic neuroscientific claims that reinforce or justify gender stereotypes in ways that are not scientifically justified). Reception =Popular press= In the UK, the book received positive reviews in Nature, Preview and rental of the article available on readcube.com here. The Independent, The Times Literary Supplement, New Scientist, Metro and The Belfast Telegraph. The Guardian and London Evening Standard each chose it as a Book of the Year.

Delusions of Gender received positive reviews in the United States in The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today, Newsweek, Jezebel and Kirkus Reviews. Publishers Weekly chose it for a starred review and as a Pick of the Week. More positive reviews came from Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, The Globe and Mail, Socialist Worker, Out in Perth, The Fat Quarter, Erotic Review, The F Word, Counterfire, Neuroskeptic (at Discover magazine). Ms. magazine and Elle singled the book out for their readers. *2013 Warwick Prize for Writing, shortlist *2011 Victorian Premier's Literary Award for Non-Fiction, shortlist *2011, Best Book of Ideas, shortlist *2010, John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, shortlist =Academic reaction= Simon Baron-Cohen reviewed the book in The Psychologist. In it, he accused Fine of \\"fusing science with politics,\\" writing, \\"Where I ‚Äì and I suspect many other contemporary scientists ‚Äì would part ways with Fine is in her strident, extreme denial of the role that biology might play in giving rise to any sex differences in the mind and brain. ...(she) ignores that you can be a scientist interested in the nature of sex differences while being a clear supporter of equal opportunities and a firm opponent of all forms of discrimination in society.\\" Fine responded in a published letter to The Psychologist, stating \\"The thesis of my book (no veils required) is that while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don‚Äôt yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising.\\" Pdf version. Former APA President Diane F. Halpern, co- author of the article \\"The Science of Sex Differences in Mathematics and Science\\" that Fine criticizes in Delusions of Gender, reviewed the book and concluded that it was \\"strongest in exposing research conclusions that are closer to fiction than science...[but] weakest in failing to also point out differences that are supported by a body of carefully conducted and well- replicated research\\", noting that Fine largely ignores the latter body of research. Stanford neurobiologist Ben Barres stated in a review for the Public Library of Science Biology that Delusions of Gender \\"should be required reading for every neurobiology student, if not every human being.\\" Lewis Wolpert, a developmental biologist who is the author of Why can't a woman be more like a man?, in a video lecture stated that Fine \\"[hasn't] got a clue about biology\\". McCarthy and Ball (2011) reviewed the book in the journal Biology of Sex Differences. They acknowledged that \\"Prompting laypeople to adopt a more critical view of overly simplistic views of complex data sets is a goal any scientist can support, and for that we applaud (Fine's) efforts.\\" However, their overall review is not positive, and they suggest that Fine's book presents an oversimplified and seriously distorted characterization of neuroscience as applied to the study of sex differences. They expressed disappointment that Fine's book \\"...can be vexing in the ways the scientific study of sex differences in brain and behavior is portrayed and (how) the current state-of-the-art is presented.\\" However, later work by Fine published in the journal Neuroethics identified systematic issues in the way human neuroimaging investigations of sex differences tend to be investigated, contra the notion of a few 'bad apples'. Many of the criticisms of such work made in Delusions of Gender were noted in the article \\"Perils and pitfalls of reporting sex differences\\" by Donna L. Maney, as part of a Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society Theme Issue \\"Multifaceted origins of sex differences in the brain', compiled and edited by McCarthy in 2016. Evolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk, reviewing the book with Rebecca Jordan- Young's Brain Storm, in the Quarterly Review of Biology wrote: \\"It is important to emphasize that neither author advocates throwing the gender- neutral baby out with its pink or blue bathwater ... The books are good ammunition for arguments with people who think science has incontrovertibly shown biological bases for gender differences such as mathematical ability. At the same time, they are not simply claiming that ‚Äúit is all culture‚Äù or that science can play no role in understanding gender. Both Fine and Jordan-Young want better science, not less of it.\\"  See also  *Gender role *Implicit stereotypes *Sex and intelligence *Sexism *Stereotype References External links * The book's official site * one hour video Category:2010 non-fiction books Category:English-language books Category:Gender studies books Category:Neuroscience books Category:Gender-related stereotypes Category:W.

Chinese rebels along the Yangtze River attacked the SS Alice Dollar on July 20, so the gunboat was assigned to escort the vessel out of the area. On the following day, during the operation, rebels attacked again but were silenced by American counter- fire.Tolley, p. 88‚Äì89. Incident The Alice Dollar, of the Dollar Line, was steaming upriver to the treaty port of Tang Chia To in the day of July 20 when armed Chinese rebels, belonging to a local warlord, opened fire on the ship with small arms. The Americans were able to increase their speed and escape to port with minor damage and no casualties. Captain C. D. Gilroy, of USS Monocacy, was informed of the situation and asked to escort the merchant ship back down the river on the next day, July 21. While only four miles off Chungking, Chinese rebels along the river again attacked from the north bank of the Yangtze. Due to other related incidents in the past, the crews of Monocacys machine guns and cannons were immediately ordered to return fire. Within just a few minutes and after firing six shells, the Chinese were in retreat but downriver, they attacked once more. The Americans again returned fire and shot several more shells and hundreds of bullets into the surrounding hills, forcing the rebels to abandon their attempt. Captain Gilroy estimated that his ship was fired on 600 times though only 15 bullet holes were counted and two men were slightly wounded. After the affair, the U.S. consul in Chungking demanded and received a Chinese apology but no restitution was requested.

It connects the northern and southern basins of Bras d'Or Lake, an inland saltwater body that dominates the centre of Cape Breton Island. The border between two of Cape Breton Island's counties runs through the strait; the community of Grand Narrows, in Cape Breton County, is situated on the eastern shore while the community of Iona, in Victoria County is situated on the western shore. Grand Narrows The Mi'kmaq name for the strait was Taawitk, \\"where the water flows out.\\" An early descriptive name for the strait, Grand Narrows, has persisted as the name of the neighbouring community on the east bank and as the name of the railroad bridge over the Strait. \\"Grand\\" to distinguish it from the \\"Little Narrows,\\" on the same Bras d'Or Lake. The Grand Narrows was also known, as far as the Strait is concerned, as the \\"Barra Strait.\\" This after the Sound of Barra on the Isle of Barra in the Scottish Hebrides, where most of the settlers in this neighbourhood came from about the year 1802. The name, \\"Barra Strait\\" was approved November 2, 1950. Transportation The opening of the St. Peters Canal in 1869 saw the Barra Strait become part of a sheltered coastal shipping route between Sydney and the Strait of Canso for sailing and steam powered vessels. Vessels transiting this route are only limited by the size of the lock in the St. Peters Canal, which measures long, wide, and draught. Boat traffic through the Barra Strait has been logged since 1991, and has consistently ranged between 1700 and 2100 boats passing through the swing and bascule bridges each year, with a peak of 2100 passages recorded for 2002. Of these movements, an estimated 2% are commercial activity, 8% are government and 90% are recreational. Approaching the Barra Strait and its bridges from the north. In the foreground is Barra Strait Bridge. Behind it (with the arched spans) is the Grand Narrows Bridge. The bridges In the late 1880s the Intercolonial Railway of Canada bridged the strait with the Grand Narrows Bridge (also known as the Barra Strait Railway Bridge), the longest railway bridge in the province, crossing between Uniacke Point to the west and Kelly Point to the east. This railway bridge incorporates a swing span to permit the continued passage of marine traffic through the strait. The Government of Nova Scotia operated a small ferry service for motor vehicles across the strait for much of the 20th century. It was replaced in October 1993 with a double leaf bascule bridge, the Barra Strait Bridge, carrying Route 223. Bathymetry The Barra Strait is over deep at its southern entrance between Hectors Point to the west and Derby Point to the east. The strait continues to the north-east where it narrows to slightly more than between Uniacke and Kelly Points. The bottom rises to a maximum depth of between these points. There is draught in the navigation channel through the bridge openings. The tidal stream through the Barra Strait runs the strongest at mid-flood and mid-ebb, and attain a rate of 3 knots. The tidal streams set 010¬∞/190¬∞ through the strait, except in the vicinity of the swing bridge span where they are deflected NW and SW by Kelly Point.

Bhopal gas tragedy  Rashida Bee along with Champa Devi Shukla, both survivors of the infamous Bhopal gas tragedy in 1984, led an international campaign against Dow Chemical and its subsidiary Union Carbide and to get justice for the victims of that December night. In 1999, along with other victims, they filed a class-action lawsuit against Union Carbide. In 2002, they organised a 19-day hunger strike in New Delhi, demanding that the former Union Carbide CEO Warren Anderson face a criminal trial in Bhopal. They also called for Dow to provide long-term health care for survivors and their children, clean up the former Union Carbide site, and supply economic support to survivors who can no longer work due to illness.  Awards  On the 20th anniversary of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, in 2004, Bee and Shukla received the Goldman Environmental Prize awarded in a ceremony in San Francisco, California, on April 19. Bee used the award money to open Chingari Trust, a trust to provide medical help to children born with defects. It has registered 300 children up to 12 years old. Space constraints, however, only allow them to accommodate 60 children a day. The centre has a speech therapist, physiotherapist, special educators and doctors. The trust also provides employment for people who cannot work because of sickness.  Personal life  Bee works at the Central Government Press, where she is a junior binder.

They were traditionally involved in the polishing and furbishing of metals. Little is known as to the origin of this community, other than that they are one of a number of Muslim artisan groups found in Maharashtra. The Saiqalgar may be converts from the Hindu Sikligar community. They speak the Dakhani dialect of Urdu among themselves, and Marathi with outsiders. The Saiqalgars are found mainly in the districts of Kolhapur and Sangli. They are an extremely small community, with their settlements containing only a few families. Present circumstances The Saiqalgar are now divided into groups, those who are now mainly small to medium-sized farmers, and a smaller groups who are still involved with the polishing and furbishing of metals. Among the latter groups, a small number have taken to the manufacture of fireworks. The Saiqalgar generally marry within the community but there are instances of marriage with neighbouring Muslim groups such as the Attar, Maner, Patwager and Tamboli. Like most Muslim artisan groups, the Saiqalgar have a caste association, the Sqailgar Jamaat. This organizations acts both as a welfare organization, as well as an instrument of social.

One of the earliest key pieces legislation and projects under the 47th Senate (Fall 2017 to Spring 2018) was re-establishing the 'Issues & Forums' committee that fosters political discussion between different points of view, which was led by Senator Schilperoort of the Washington State University College of Agricultural, Human, and Natural Resource Sciences. Another major endeavor was renaming a plaza on campus on behalf of the Multicultural Greek Community at WSU, partly led by Senator Hernandez of the Carson College of Business. All-Campus Senator Pielow authored bills to strengthen the independent and unbiased role of an election board, initiating requirements for all Senators to disclose their affiliated RSOs to tackle fiscal nepotism, and introducing new voter registration campaigns at WSU's dorms during the Week of Welcome. Senators Parchem and Dalton, along with Delegate Brown, attempted to introduce a mandatory sports pass for all undergraduates at WSU, though it was eventually thwarted by Senator Pielow. Honors College Delegate Arend had authored and passed a constitutional amendment that changed the position of Honors College Delegate into Honors College Senator, which was eventually passed and ratified by the voters. Historical lobbying efforts ASWSU on all campuses recently voted to opt out of the Washington Student Association as a lobbying group. Campus leaders did not believe the lobbying group was providing enough for what students' were paying. ASWSU President (Pullman) Jake Bredstrand also remarked that the addition of community colleges in the lobbying group as it \\"brings in other schools that have needs far different from ours\\". The campus newspaper (The Daily Evergreen) recently supported the decision, stating their opinion that \\"A coalition can be accomplished without a middle-man like the WSA and if it involves more direct talk between Washington colleges, then we all might find a way out of this budget crisis together\\".

For the purposes of the following analysis, energy is conserved for a fluid in an open channel flow, and head losses due to friction will be neglected. The energy calculated at one location in the flow will be equal to the energy calculated at any other location in the same flow. The energy for the flow will have a potential energy component calculated from the depth of water in the flow, a pressure component, and a kinetic energy component calculated from the velocity of the flow moving through the channel. This is depicted through the Bernoulli equation: where: E = energy [=] Length*Force, v = velocity [=] Length/Time, g = acceleration due to gravity [=] Length/Time2, y = depth of water in the flow [=] Length, p = pressure [=] Force/Length2, and \\\\gamma = specific gravity of the fluid [=] Force/Length3, For two locations in the system with the datum chosen as the bottom of a channel with no slope: For an open channel flow the fluid, water, is open to the atmosphere so that the pressure throughout the system can be considered equal to atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the pressure term will be the same (hydrostatic) at all points in the system, reducing the equation to: For a rectangular channel the flow velocity can be related to a discharge rate per unit width, q, such that: and For given values of unit discharge, q, a specific energy diagram depicting energy and the depth of water, y, can be developed. The specific energy is the energy above the datum, which we have chosen as the bottom of the channel. Figure1. For each value of unit discharge, there is an associated critical depth, yc. Flow travelling at a depth greater than the critical depth is subcritical, and flow travelling at a depth less than the critical depth is supercritical. Subcritical flow has a larger potential energy component, and supercritical flow has a larger kinetic energy component. For a given energy value there will generally be two possible depths, a subcritical depth and a supercritical depth. These depths are related by the alternate depth equation: }}} Either alternate depth value can be found with the alternate depth equation if the unit discharge and one of the depth values is known. Figure2 The critical depth is the smallest energy value on the specific energy diagram. Therefore, we can take the first derivative of the energy equation with respect to depth to determine the critical depth (dE/dy) and equate it to zero to determine the minimum value. Solving for the critical depth we obtain: and The energy associated with the critical depth can be determined by substituting Equation into Equation to reveal the following: In addition the dimensionless Froude number is defined as follows: }} where: Fr =1 at critical conditions, Fr<1 at subcritical conditions, and Fr>1 at supercritical conditions.  Example For a given flow in a rectangular channel with a unit discharge of 20 ft3/s and initial upstream depth of 4.4 ft (See Figure 1.) the specific energy can be calculated from Equation : E=\\\\frac{(20\\\\frac{ft^3}{s})^2}{2(32.2\\\\frac{ft}{s^2})(4.4ft)^2}+4.4ft=4.7 ft the critical depth can be calculated from Equation as: y_c=\\\\sqrt[3]{(20\\\\frac{ft^3}{s})^2 \\\\over 32.2\\\\frac{ft}{s^2}}=2.3ft, and the alternate depth downstream can be calculated from Equation as: y_2 = \\\\frac{2(4.4)}{-1 + \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\frac{8(32.2)(4.4)^3}{(20)^2}}} = 1.4 ft If a sluice gate is lowered into a subcritical flow to a depth lower than the critical depth, the flow downstream of the sluice gate will become supercritical and this downstream depth will be the alternate depth as seen in the figure below where the sluice gate is lowered to a depth of 2 ft (< yc = 2.3 ft and > y2 = 1.4 ft). Figure3  Choke conditions The specific energy diagram is specific to the unit discharge for a given flow rate. For any given flow an obstruction such as a sluice gate, a step in the channel bottom, or a constriction might require more energy than the flow originally possesses, and thus a transient condition is set up where the unit discharge is temporarily reduced as the flow backs up and gains energy. As an example of this consider a sluice gate that lowers below the alternate depth of the flow described above (1.4 ft). If the sluice gate is lowered to a depth of 1 ft, the flow described above will not be possible. The energy required to pass through the sluice gate at the flow conditions described will not be sufficient. In this case, a \\"choke\\" is encountered at the sluice gate. The energy required to pass with downstream depth of 1 ft can be calculated using Equation . E = \\\\frac{(20\\\\frac{ft^2}{s})^2}{2(32.2 \\\\frac{ft}{s^2})(1 ft)^2} + 1 ft = 7.2 ft Since this is more energy than the initially described flow parameters (E = 4.7 ft), the flow upstream of the sluice gate will need to acquire more energy in order to pass through the opening. The only mechanism the flow has to acquire more energy is through the increase of initial upstream depth due to the choke conditions. The flow will begin to pass through the opening when it has acquired the minimum energy required to do so, the critical energy (Ec). The transient depth downstream of the sluice gate cannot be greater than the depth of the sluice gate so that y2 will now be 1 ft. The new upstream flow rate can be calculated by rearranging Equation and inputting our known value of energy (4.7 ft): q = \\\\sqrt{2gy^2E - 2gy^3} = \\\\sqrt{(2)(32.2 \\\\frac{ft}{s^2})(1 ft)^2(4.7 ft) - (2)(32.2 \\\\frac{ft}{s^2})(1 ft)^3} = 15.4 \\\\frac{ft^2}{s} The discharge under the gate will increase gradually as the flow upstream rises and the flow can pass under the gate at the depth original unit discharge rate of 20 ft2/s. The new steady state upstream depth can be calculated using Equation with a downstream depth of 1 ft (max depth allowed by the gate) and the original unit discharge rate: y_1 = \\\\frac{(2)(1 ft)}{-1 + \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\frac{8(32.2 \\\\frac{ft}{s^2})(1 ft)^3}{(20 \\\\frac{ft^2}{s})^2}}} = 7.1 ft Figure4 In this example of a choke you need to evaluate depths with varying unit discharges. This can be done using the specific energy diagram. Figure5  Dimensionless diagram Another way to evaluate a sluice gate problem is to develop the dimensionless form of this diagram dividing the energy equation by the critical depth and substituting Equation : where \\\\; y' = \\\\frac{y}{y_c} and \\\\; E' = \\\\frac{E}{y_c} Equation 15 is the dimensionless form of E-y diagram, which is in similar form to the dimensionless form of M-y diagram if we replace y' with 1 / y' . Substituting Equation and Equation into Equation we can determine the following relationship: With this relationship we know that values on the dimensionless E'-y' diagram with the same value of y' will have the same Froude number. In this way we can determine the conditions of flow. The minimum value of E' on the dimensionless diagram will be the first derivative of Equation with respect to y' (dE'/dy') equated to 0 for the minimum value: Giving y' = 1 or yc = y at the minimum value for E'. We can determine from this that the lowest E' value will be at the critical depth: Considering the initial conditions with the sluice gate example above with y = 4.4 ft and yc = 2.3 ft we can calculate y' and E': y' = \\\\frac{y}{y_c} = \\\\frac{4.4 ft}{2.3 ft} = 1.9 E' = y' + \\\\frac{1}{2y'^2} = 1.9 + \\\\frac{1}{2(1.9)^2} = 2.0 The dimensionless diagram representation for these conditions would be: Figure6 Knowing the value of y' for the subcritical flow is 3.1, and E' is 3.1, the alternate depth value of y' can be determined by finding the supercritical value where the diagram crosses E' at 2.0. From the graph, this value can be determined to be 0.60. This can also be calculated by solving for the alternate value of y' using Equation : 2.0 = y' + \\\\frac{1}{2y'^2} \\\\ or \\\\ 4y'^2 - 2y'^3 - 1 = 0 \\\\ where \\\\ y' = 0.60 Solving for the alternate depth: \\\\ y_2 = y'y_c = (0.60)(2.3 ft) = 1.4 ft This is the same value we obtained above using the original specific energy diagram (with dimensions) and specific energy equation! For the choke conditions described above with y1 = 7.1 ft and yc = 2.3 ft we can calculate y‚Äô and E‚Äô: y' = \\\\frac{y}{y_c} = \\\\frac{7.1 ft}{2.3 ft} = 3.1 E' = y' + \\\\frac{1}{2y'^2} = 3.1 + \\\\frac{1}{2(3.1)^2} = 3.1 The dimensionless diagram representation for these conditions would be: Figure7 From the graph, this value can be determined to be 0.43. Solving for the alternate value of y' using Equation : 3.1 = y' + \\\\frac{1}{2y'^2} \\\\ or \\\\ 6.3y'^2 - 2y'^3 - 1 = 0 \\\\ where \\\\ y' = 0.93 Solving for the alternate depth: \\\\ y_2 = y'y_c = (0.93)(2.3 ft) = 1.0 ft This is the same value we assigned for y2 previously!

They are culturally and linguistically similar to both Rangpuri people of northern Bangladesh and Goalpariya people of Assam. A small number of the community are also found in the neighboring state of Bihar, where they are known as the Bengali Shaikh. These people are more commonly known as Rajbongshi Muslims. The Nashya are considered to be an important indigenous group found in northern West Bengal.Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 74-89 They are homogeneous with the Koch Rajbongshi people and are bi-linguistic speaking both Bengali language and Koch language with Koch Rajbongshi language being replaced by Bengali language among the newer generations.  Etymology  There are descendants from Koch-Rajbonshi, Mech, Rabha, Bodo and Indo-Aryan people who converted to Islam. They mainly speak the Goalpariya dialect . They are mainly settled in the districts of Dhuburi, Goalpara, South Salmara and Kokrajhar. These people were loose followers of Hinduism. But when a small section of these people converted to Islam, the act was frowned upon. The local Hindus started calling them \\"nosto seikh\\" meaning \\"spoiled Shaikh\\". But as more number of people got converted to Islam with time these people came in contact with mainstream Muslims, and the term \\"nosto seikh\\" slowly got islamicised into \\"Nashya seikh\\".  Origin  The Nashyas trace their origin to the indigenous communities of Koch Rajbongshi of northern West Bengal, though some of them are also from Mech community. There conversion to Islam is said to have taken over two to three centuries, and the Nashya still retain many cultural traits of their pre-Islamic past. Most people of the community are non-practicing Muslims though the newer generations are becoming increasing Islamic due to globalization. From historic evidence, it seems a segment of the indigenous population of north Bengal converted started to convert to Islam when the region fell under the control of Bakhtiyar Khilji. Some of the earliest converts were the chiefs Ali Mach and Kala Pahar.

About Co-founded in 2006 by educators Vicki Davis (U.S.) and Julie Lindsay (Australia), the Flat Classroom¬Æ Project is a global collaborative project designed for students, typically in Grade 3 - 12, using Web 2.0 tools to support communication and collaboration between students and teachers from classrooms around the world. The project was inspired by topics included in Thomas Friedman's international bestselling book The World Is Flat: The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century and was featured in the 2007 update \\"Release 3.0\\" of that book. The original project served as a foundation which has been recreated and expanded. Currently the project runs three times a year. The project has gained international recognition and awards from the International Society of Technology Educators(ISTE), Taking IT Global, World Innovation Summit for Education, and Edublog Awards and has fostered four similar projects based on the same holistic and constructivist educational approach, including the Digiteen, Eracism, NetGenEd, and A Week in the Life projects. The first spin- off the NetGenEd Project, originally called the Horizon Project, examines the book Growing Up Digital, by Don Tapscott, in conjunction with the New Media Consortium's annual Horizon Report. Another spin-off effort is the Flat Classroom‚Ñ¢ Conference which brings together geographically distant students that may have participated in one of the affiliated projects for a face-to- face meeting. At the conference students share ideas and take part in theme- based workshops to take back to their home schools. Themes are designed to explore global social issues and inspire unity and action, while advancing continued student-to-student and educator-to-educator connections. =Pedagogical approach= The goal of the Flat Classroom Project is to create global collaborative projects and maintain workspaces for students (at all school levels) and educators around the world. The aim is to provide bridging between students, educators, trainee teachers, and post-secondary education institutions. By \\"flattening\\" the walls of the traditional classroom, participating classes essentially become one large virtual classroom, co- taught by participating teachers, via the Internet and a combination of synchronous and asynchronous communication tools. The project is designed to: * develop cultural understanding; * further skills with Web 2.0 and other software tools; * provide experience in global collaboration and online learning; * raise awareness of what it means to live and work in a globalised world; * encourage research and discussion around the ideas developed in Friedman's core text. The core pedagogical approach includes the development of two primary products. The first product involves groups of students working collaboratively to compose a wiki web page, based on topic research, and using Wikipedia as a model. The second product involves individual students creating a multimedia artefact, again based on topic research, which should also include a portion requested from another student in a different part of the world. Student work is assessed with common criteria-based rubrics and reviewed by a panel of international judges. It is designed as a multi-modal, inter-disciplinary learning experience that highlights digital citizenship. Additionally, participating students are encouraged to develop Personal Learning Environments and Networks, using a variety of Internet tools, while conducting their research. =Participants= Since 2009, students and teachers from the following schools have participated in the Flat Classroom Project Academy of Allied Health and Science, Neptune, New Jersey, USA Anglo-American School of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria Alta Vista School, Los Gatos, CA, USA Bawlf School, Bawlf, Alberta, Canada Beijing BISS International School, Beijing, China The Bullis School, Potomac, Maryland, USA Canadian International School of Hong Kong, China Carrabassett Valley, Carrabassett, Maine, USA Choithram International World School, Indore, India Citrus High School, Inverness, Florida, USA Campo Verde High School, Gilbert, Arizona, USA Don Mills Collegiate Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Gilbert High School, Gilbert, Arizona, USA Goodland High School, Goodland, Kansas, USA Granville College, South West Sydney Institute of Technical and Further Education, Australia Grup Scolar Agricol Holboca, Sos.

Project = With the success of the other projects it became apparent that many teachers of elementary students were wanting to also take part in the Flat Classroom experience. Beginning in October 2010 through to February 2011 eight international schools joined together to plan, work through and initiate the project. Schools Involved * The Phoenix School - Salem, Massachusetts * International School of Bombay - Mumbai, India * Yew Chung International School of Beijing - China * International School of Prague - Czech Republic * Denton Avenue School - New York * Falcon School for Girls - London, England * Yarmouth Elementary School - Yarmouth, Maine * Mill Creek School - Illinois Five different categories were chosen for the students to investigate their lives and compare them to other students in the project. The categories chosen were Food and Celebrations, Clothing, Transportation, School Life and Housing. Within each of these categories teams were created with members from each school participating. A teacher mentor was in charge of each category to keep the teams focused. Synchronous and asynchronous methods were used to allow for authentic global collaboration among the students. At the end of the project each team combined their information together into one artifact representing their category sharing their lives from around the world. Teachers as well as students greatly benefited from the collaboration and helped to building relationships that are continuing on. The pilot project was deemed a success and it has developed into a regular project under the Flat Classroom umbrella.

ADF claims that students who have attempted to speak against same-sex relationships and behavior have been censored or, in some cases, punished for their actions under campus hate-speech rules, such as Tyler Chase Harper, a high school student whose suspension led to the first Day of Truth. Harper was suspended for wearing a T-shirt that read \\"Be Ashamed\\" and \\"Our School Embraced What God Has Condemned,\\" and on the back read, \\"Homosexuality is Shameful\\" and \\"Romans 1:27.\\" The Alliance Defense Fund filed an unsuccessful federal lawsuit against school officials on behalf of Harper, claiming his religious freedoms were violated. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled that the case was moot because Harper had already graduated, declined to further consider it, and ordered the lower court to vacate their decision against Harper, leaving future matters open for litigation as though the previous trial had never occurred.

In 1995 he became a curator at the Dallas Museum of Natural History (now the Perot Museum of Nature and Science). He currently works at the museum and as an adjunct associate professor of Paleontology at Southern Methodist University. He has worked with the National Park Service in several national park units including Big Bend National Park, Denali National Park, Aniakchak National Monument, and Wrangell-St. Elias National Park to identify, study and preserve dinosaur fossils found. In 2008, he was honored with a fellowship in the Geological Society of America. For his long-time commitment to dinosaur paleontology within the National Park units in Alaska, he was recognized by the international George Wright Society with the prestigious Natural Resource Achievement Award. Since 1998 the primary focus of his work has been on polar dinosaurs, and more specifically the ancient Arctic dinosaurs of Alaska. Of the four Alaskan dinosaurs that have names, Fiorillo has named two of them: Pachyrhinosaurus perotorum and Nanuqsaurus hoglundi, which he named in honor of wealthy Texans. P. perotorum is christened after the billionaire Ross Perot and his family. Although Perot is not necessarily connected to Alaska or paleontology, he has given generously to the Perot Museum, which also bears his name. N. hoglundi is named for Forrest Hoglund, a Texas oil millionaire who has also donated generously. Fiorillo and his colleagues have unearthed new polar dinosaurs as well as obtained insights into the ancient polar climate during one of Earth's greenhouse modes.

He was the head of several large firm of merchants and contractors, including a large fleet of barges on the River Medway. He was mayor of Rochester from 1900 to 1902, having been long involved in local politics, chairing a local Conservative ward committee. In August 1903 the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Rochester, Viscount Cranborne succeeded to the peerage as Marquess of Salisbury, and was therefore elevated to the House of Lords, creating a vacancy in the Commons. On 3 September Tuff was adopted as the Unionist candidate for the resulting by- election by the Rochester Liberal Unionist association and the Rochester Constitutional Association. He held the seat with a majority of 11.6% over his only opponent, the Liberal Party candidate Sir Harry Johnston. However, he was defeated at the 1906 general election by the Liberal candidate Ernest Henry Lamb, and did not stand again. Tuff was also a Justice of the Peace (J.P.) for Rochester and for Kent.

Design  The blocks were made up of a fibrous material with large interstices between the fibers. (One suggested fiber was excelsior, which is also known as wood wool.) Despite having large interstices, Fuller and Hewlett designed the blocks so they would not be absorbent. To make the blocks, the fibers were coated with plaster and molded in a form. This is called the Stockade Pneumatic Forming Process. These blocks were cast with large holes in them so that a weight-bearing structure, such as concrete, could be poured inside them. The block's fibers were designed to be easily sawed so workers could cut holes in them to rest floor joists on the weight-bearing structure. The blocks came in various shapes and sizes. Some had two vertical holes for filling with concrete. Other blocks were much larger, with openings in the side for inserting large beams.

In common with other Christian fundamentalist groups, HA regards heterosexuality as \\"the universal creation-norm\\". This approach has been criticized for stressing that a person must renounce homosexuality to be a Christian, and because there is no valid scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed. Christopher Melilo, Colin Cook and Douglas McIntyre, who had all struggled with same-sex attractions, founded HA in 1980 with financial support from the Seventh-day Adventist denomination. HA uses a 14-step program developed by Cook, based on his own experiences. Cook resigned in 1986 following a scandal involving him allegedly having sex with 12 out of the 14 male clients interviewed from 1980 to 1986. History HA was founded in 1980 by Colin Cook (a Seventh-day Adventist pastor who was defrocked in 1974 for having sex with a man in his church) and ex-gay Douglas McIntyre. Cook founded the Quest Learning Center in Reading, Pennsylvania as a ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church to \\"help people find freedom from homosexuality.\\" HA was one of seven programs offered by Quest, and people came from around the US seeking assistance from Cook. Cook developed the 14-step program used by HA, modifying five of the standard twelve steps from the Alcoholics Anonymous program and basing the other nine on his personal experience. HA was supported by $47,000 in annual support from the Adventist Church, plus fees paid for treatment. McIntyre (who, when growing up, identified as gay) said he founded HA based on his belief that \\"homosexuality is not something you're born with, that it's a spin-off of a trauma that occurs during childhood.\\" He attributes abuse at the ages of three and four, and molestation at the age of five, as having contributed to his homosexual attraction. Rumours of sexual misconduct by Cook came to light in 1986 when Ron Lawson, a gay Adventist and Professor of Sociology at Queens College, New York, began an investigation by interviewing Cook's former clients and writing a letter to church officials outlining his indiscretions. Lawson interviewed 14 individuals counselled by Cook as part of the HA program; none reported any change in sexual orientation as a consequence of HA, and all but two reported having sex with Cook. Cook resigned from HA and shut down Quest; the Adventists withdrew their funding support. With Cook's departure, McIntyre took over as executive director of HA. Counseling sessions with Cook included giving his clients nude massages, ostensibly to desensitize them to male‚Äìmale contact and homosexual desires; however, this was counter-productive since counselees began having sexual encounters with each other. Cook admitted in a 1987 interview that he had \\"fell into the delusion\\" that such actions were a legitimate part of his HA counseling activities, stating: \\"I allowed myself to hug and hold my counselees thinking I was helping them...But I needed it more than they did.\\" Psychiatrist Ralph Blair in his 1982 monograph Ex-Gay describes practitioners of sexual orientation conversion through religion as often being \\"individuals deeply troubled about their own sexual orientation, or whose own sexual conversion is incomplete\\". Blair reports a host of problems with such counselors, including the sexual abuse of clients; Haldeman describes Cook as \\"the most notable of such ministers\\". Cook himself also admitted to \\"occasional falls\\" before (and throughout) his marriage. Despite his 1974 defrocking and the 1986 revelations of his client abuse, Cook remains dedicated to the belief that homosexuality can be changed. In 1993 he moved to Colorado and returned to counseling, which ended in 1995 when The Denver Post reported Cook was engaging in phone sex and asking \\"patients to bring homosexual pornography to sessions so that he could help desensitize them against it\\". As recently as 2007, Cook has still been promoting the ability to \\"heal homosexuals\\". Under McIntyre, HA has also taken on more political advocacy. In 2009 he led a conference held in Kenya promoting the ex-gay movement, controversial to homosexuals as an example of ex-gay advocacy events held in Africa which are followed by incidents of homophobic violence. Organization The headquarters of Homosexuals Anonymous is in Houston, Texas. , the organization has chapters in the United States, Germany, New Zealand and El Salvador. HA is a member of the Positive Alternatives to Homosexuality (PATH) group. HA is affiliated with JASON Ministries, headquartered in Germany. It publishes a newsletter and web site and organizes a \\"Homosexuals Anonymous Annual Conference\\". Program The HA program relies on belief in Jesus Christ to effect sexual orientation change. Similar to Alcoholics Anonymous, the change takes place over a lifetime, according to HA. Local chapters conduct meetings at regular intervals where members provide fellowship and support to one another. Unlike AA's 12-step program, HA has 14 steps which are used by about 50 chapters of HA throughout North America. Nine of the steps were based on the experiences of founder Cook, while the other five are adaptations of AA steps. One analysis of the 14 steps commented on the \\"alleged generosity\\" of the HA approach, noting that while both approaches emphasize avoidance of undesired behaviors, \\"AA groups accept the person along with their problems, [whereas] Homosexuals Anonymous stresses that the person is guilty of the sin of homosexuality, must admit it, renounce it, and then accept heterosexuality as a necessary condition to becoming a Christian.\\" According to gay affirmative psychotherapists Kathleen Ritter and Anthony Terndrup, ex-gay organizations like Exodus International and Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays (PFOX) use this adapted model developed by HA. Effectiveness As with twelve-step programs in general, and with AA in particular, it is difficult to determine the success rate of the program due to the high attrition rate. However, the organization cites several cases where people have changed their sexual orientation. Reporting on Lawson's 1986 findings, the Los Angeles Times reported that counselees' reactions to the Cook revelations followed a common pattern: \\"a loss of faith, loss of trust in other human beings, and a lack of motivation to get on with their lives\\". In addition, many of the counselees stayed in Reading, \\"unwilling or unable to go home to families who expected them to be changed\\". Despite these reports of harm from involvement with HA, such reports are not universal. A longitudinal study by Stanton Jones and Mark Yarhouse reported \\"that on average participants experienced no harm from the attempt to change [but the authors] cannot conclude that specific individuals are not harmed by an attempt to change\\". Wayne Besen claims that former HA clients have reported that the program is ineffective. Besen quotes one former client \\"One thing that really clued me in was [meeting] with my sponsor every week and hearing him talk about his struggles and talking to other people in the group, and there were people in that group who had been going to HA for four, five, six, seven years and they seemed to be at the exact same spot I was. I didn't see any graduates. I saw people that were still there, that hadn't changed. They were still struggling. ... I don't know anybody from my ex-gay group ... who claims to be ex-gay now.\\" Criticism One critic of HA is Cindi Love, the executive director of Soulforce, who states that \\"the message that homosexuality can be 'repaired' doesn't just ruin lives - it ends them\\". She describes the expansion of ex-gay organizations around the world as \\"rearing [their] ugly heads,\\" specifically citing HA's expansion into El Salvador, New Zealand, and Germany, and criticising HA executive director McIntyre's Kenyan conference. Wayne Besen, former spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign and founder of Truth Wins Out, has argued that the GLBT community needs to challenge the propaganda presented at ex-gay events including those run by HA. He also advocates covert operations against HA and other ex-gay ministries in an attempt to \\"catch ex-gay leaders engaging in not so ex-gay behavior\\", though such attempts to discredit the industry are controversial even within the GLBT community. Besen has accused HA of re-writing history, omitting details of Cook's past from its web site. \\"[R]eading the group's Web page, one would think that Cook was a smashing success and paragon of heterosexuality,\\" he writes. Haldeman has described the response of the Seventh Day Adventist Church to the 1986 Cook revelations as a cover-up whilst Lawson titled his 1987 presentation to the annual convention of the American Sociological Association: Scandal in the Adventist-funded program to 'heal' homosexuals: Failure, sexual exploitation, official silence, and attempts to rehabilitate the exploiter and his methods. In Julie Scott Jones' study of Christian fundamentalism, Being the Chosen, HA, Exodus International and NARTH are described as organizations that \\"particularly target teenagers' burgeoning sexuality, and feed into a wider fundamentalist view that all forms of 'sexual immorality' are destroying the moral fabric of the nation\\".

As such, many notable families of Raqqah could trace their ancestry back to the Milan, though these had been mostly assimilated already in the late 19th century.Ababsa, Myriam. ‚ÄúMise en Valeur Agricole et Contr√¥le Politique de la Vall√©e de l‚ÄôEuphrate (1865-1946): √©tude des Relations Etat, Nomades et Citadins dans le Caza de Raqqa.‚Äù Bulletin d‚ÄôEtudes Orientales 53-54, no. 1-2 (2002): 459-488. Its most renowned chief was Ibrahim Pasha, who lead the tribe from 1863 to 1908.

Immigration due to the Irish Great Famine (1845‚Äì1852) had provided many thousands of men as potential recruits although issues of race, religion, pacifism and personal allegiance created some resistance to service. A significant body of these Irishmen later used the military experience gained in the American Civil War to fight against British forces with the goal of establishing an Irish Republic as members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the Fenian Brotherhood and Clan na Gael.  Pre-1861 Irish immigration  Irish immigration to the United States has taken place since colonial times (such as John Barry of the U.S. Navy, while Andrew Jackson was partially Scots-Irish). Six Declaration of Independence signers were of Irish and Ulster Scot descent, with one signee Charles Carroll of Carrollton, being the only Catholic signer.Irish Americans - Google Books However, conditions in Ireland (under Protestant control and British sovereignty) -- especially the Great Famine‚Äîcaused many Catholic Irish to emigrate in the mid-19th century. An Irish immigrant, having suffered through an arduous overseas journey, would have been thrust into a difficult and unfamiliar situation, as many were poor and unused to American customs. Soon, however, the number of Irish-Americans in some cities grew so great that immigrant Patrick Murphy stated \\"New York is a grand handsome city. But you would hardly know you had left Ireland.\\" American customs, once utterly foreign to the immigrants, became blended with traditional ones, forming a distinct Irish-American culture.  The American Civil War  Most Irish- Americans had settled in the northern, American states and were thus called up to serve in the union army when the southern states seceded and formed the Confederacy in 1861. Many Irish-Americans formed their own units which embraced Irish customs such as Catholic masses and priests. = The 1863 draft riots = On March 3, 1863, Congress passed the Enrollment Act which required single men age 20 to 45 and married men up to age 35 to register for the draft. This act angered many northern whites, mainly Irish immigrants who had accepted U.S. citizenship, not realizing that citizenship also made immigrants liable for the draft. Fuel was added to the fire of their anger when black men, mostly freed slaves, were excluded from this same draft. The Irish feared that newly freed slaves from the South would migrate to the North and create further competition in the labor market. Many Irish saw this as a \\"rich man's war and a poor man's fight\\" since the policies of substitution and commutation were controversial practices which allowed drafted citizens to opt out of service by either furnishing a suitable substitute to take the place of those drafted, or pay $300 each. Both of these provisions were created with the intention of softening the effect of the draft on pacifiers, the anti-draft movement and the propertied classes. The result however was general public resentment which then turned to fury. The Riots at New York, Harpers Weekly, August 1, 1863 A few days after the Enrollment Act was passed, on March 6, 1863, the Detroit Race Riot of 1863 erupted in Detroit, Michigan, as Irish rioted for days over the draft as well as targeting black workers. Four months later, on July 13‚Äì16, as the first draft being held in New York City, the mostly Irish working class of the city started the 1863 New York City draft riots. Stores were looted and offices of newspapers which supported the Union were ransacked and burned to the ground. The rioters then targeted black people as many rioters saw the American Civil War as a war to free the slaves and thus blamed them for the draft, as well as the war. Many black people were caught by the mob, stabbed, and lynched as a result. When the riots started, the New York State Militia were absent because they had been sent to assist regular Union troops repelling General Lee's Confederate Army in Pennsylvania, thus leaving the New York City Police Department as the only serious force available to put down the riot. The city police were unable to halt a crowd which was ten times more numerous, and the rioting continued. Two days after the riot started, word came that the draft had been suspended. Federal troops returning from the Battle of Gettysburg were sent to the city to quell the riot and peace was finally restored in the streets of New York City more than a day later. An estimated 120 people are thought to have died in the draft riots in New York City, which makes this the most deadly civil insurrection in American history. = Irish service to the Union = Green Ensign of the 1st Regiment (69th N. Y. Volunteer Infantry), Irish Brigade, Union Army The Northern states remained loyal to the United States government, which was led by President Abraham Lincoln. Seven Union generals were Irish-born while an estimated 150,000 Irish-Americans fought for the Union during the war. The Irish involvement in the war was prevalent from its very beginning, as the two first recorded combat deaths (suffered at Fort Sumter in April 1861) were Irish born. Danial Hough and Edward Galloway (born in Tipperary and Cork respectively) were mortally wounded in the unfortunate explosion of one of the forts 100 guns magazines, that were set to end the siege and mark the Unions withdrawal with a 100 gun salute (a salute which was cut to 50 as a result of the accident). Hough died soon after and was buried in the parade ground, whilst Galloway died five days later.Shiels, D. (2013). The Irish in the American Civil War. The History Press. pp. 34-35. Irish-Americans living in the Union states often formed their own regiments, notably the 69th New York State Volunteers and 90th Illinois Infantry Regiment. The 69th New York Volunteers flew a green flag with a golden harp on it, symbolizing Ireland. The green flag was carried in addition to the normal regimental and national colours, making the 69th probably the only regiment to carry five colors into battle during the American Civil War. After the First Battle of Bull Run, the 69th New York Infantry was incorporated into a larger unit, the Irish Brigade. At the 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg, the brigade charged up Marye's Heights, suffering 41.4% casualties.The Irish Brigade Fought in America's Civil War ¬ª HistoryNet During the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, the Irish Brigade held a Catholic mass before facing Pickett's Charge. The Irish Brigade was the subject of the original version of a song, \\"Kelly's Irish Brigade\\", after its commander, Patrick Kelly. This has caused a dispute, with those who attribute the song to a known Confederate song of the same name (even sung to the same tune) though both are seen as of the time. Though the most prevalent and recognised of the 'Irish regiments', several other notable regiments that were largely composed of Irish immigrants also distinguished themselves in the field. For example, the 9th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment (attached to the 5th Corp.) formed largely of Irish immigrants from the Boston area suffered the loss of 15 officers and 194 enlisted men in combat (as well as 3 officers and 66 enlisted men to disease) throughout the war and were central to many of its bloodiest battles.https://civilwarintheeast.com/us- regiments-batteries/massachusetts/9th-massachusetts/ Initially led by charismatic Colonel Thomas Cass (himself an Irishman, born in Queens County), who died in 1862 after receiving wounds at the Battle of Malvern Hill, notable engagements included Mechanicsville, Gaines's Mill, Malvern Hill, Second Bull Run and Antietam. As well as notable involvements in a successful (yet possibly initially overlooked) holding action at Big Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg, the regiment was also held supporting roles in the disasters of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. The 28th Massachusetts also formed a largely Irish regiment during the war, it, however, fought below a green flag bearing the golden harp (similarly to the 69th New York).Shiels, D. (2013). The Irish in the American Civil War. The History Press. Even at the war's end, the Irish presence was felt during the tragedy of Lincoln's assassination, as the man who organised the initial manhunt for John Wilkes Booth and his conspirators (and would ultimately spearhead the capture of them all) James O'Beirne (born in County Roscommon) a Captain in the 37th New York Infantry, who had been seriously wounded in the lung at Chancellorsville, organised a huge countrywide hunt, and although not present for the final capture of Booth (an honour taken by Lafayette Baker) his role was noted by then secretary for war Edward M. Stanton.https://irishamericancivilwar.com/2010/11/05/hunting-john-wilkes- booth-the-man-who-led-the-search-for-lincolns-killer/ Initial enthusiasm to fight for the union was lessened by both spiraling casualties, the seemingly never-ending war, and crucially, the alignment between the war and the abolition of Slavery, which produced large amounts of anger in Irish communities, due to a fear that freed slaves would take the jobs often held by poor immigrants in the North (particularly seen in the draft riots of 1863). = Irish-Americans in Confederate service = Col.

Units such as the Charleston Irish VolunteersIrish Fighting Irish By Brian McGinn attracted Confederate Irish-Americans in South Carolina, the 24th Georgia Volunteer Infantry followed General Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb, while Irish Tennesseans could join the 10th Tennessee Infantry Regiment. A company of the Washington Blues regiment of the Missouri Volunteer Militia (later the Missouri State Guard), commanded by Colonel Joseph Kelly, was the subject of a Confederate song, \\"Kelly's Irish Brigade\\".

He was a United States Army veteran of World War II who spent all of the 1944 and 1945 seasons in military service.\\"Those Who Served,\\" Baseball in Wartime Baseball career Maynard's career began in 1937 in the low minors. In 1940, at age 27, he had a stellar year for the Richmond Colts of the Class B Piedmont League, clubbing 30 home runs and hitting .337.Baseball Reference: Minor league statistics for Buster Maynard His success earned Maynard a late- season call-up from the Colts' parent team, the New York Giants. His first taste of the majors lasted for seven games and was bookended by two notable games. In his MLB d√©but, Maynard led off and played center field for the Giants in their game against the Chicago Cubs at the Polo Grounds. He singled in his first MLB at bat against the Cubs' Vern Olsen, then came around to score the Giants' first run of the game. After grounding out in his second at bat, Maynard came to the plate for a third time against Olsen in the fourth inning; this time, he slammed a triple and was thrown out at home plate for trying to stretch his hit into an inside-the-park home run.Retrosheet box score: 1940-09-17 Then, in Maynard's final 1940 appearance, he collected four hits in four at bats, including another triple, and scored three runs against the Boston Bees in a 14‚Äì0 Giant rout.Retrosheet box score: 1940-09-29 Maynard batted .276 during that initial stint with the Giants, but he spent 1941 and the first month of with minor-league Jersey City. He was recalled to the majors in May 1942, and played in 210 total games for the Giants during the 1942 and seasons. However, he batted only .247 and .206 respectively, with 13 total home runs. Then, after the 1943 campaign ended, he entered the military. After the war, Maynard got a final, seven-game audition with the 1946 Giants as a pinch runner and backup outfielder. He was sent back to Jersey City and finished his pro career in the minor leagues in 1952 at age 39. As a big leaguer, he batted .221 with 136 career hits (14 doubles, five triples and 14 home runs). He died in Durham, North Carolina, at age 64 in 1977. Subject of Lasorda anecdote Years after he left baseball, however, Maynard would be remembered in a story often told by Tommy Lasorda, the Baseball Hall of Fame manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, to his players at spring training. Lasorda recalled that, as a teenager in the early 1940s, he had attended his first major league game at Shibe Park in Philadelphia, a contest between the Phillies and Maynard's Giants. As the game ended, the young Lasorda and his friends gathered in the runway between the teams' dugouts and their clubhouses in search of autographs from the big-league players. When Lasorda asked a Giant player to sign his scorecard, he was shoved out of the way. Roger Angell, Hall of Fame baseball writer and former fiction editor of The New Yorker, described what happened next: \\"'I couldn't believe it,' [Lasorda said.] 'Here was the first big-league player I'd ever seen up close ‚Äî the first one I ever dared speak to ‚Äî and what he did was shove me up against the wall ... I watched the guy as he went away toward the clubhouse and I noticed the number on his back ‚Äî you know, like taking the number of a hit-and-run car. Later on, I looked at my program and got his name. It was Buster Maynard, who was an outfielder for the Giants then. I never forgot it.'\\"Angell, Roger, Five Seasons: A Baseball Companion. By 1949, Lasorda was 21 and a left-handed pitcher in the Brooklyn Dodgers' minor-league system. One day, as he was on the mound for the Greenville Spinners in the Class A Sally League against the Augusta Tigers, he heard the public address announcer introduce the rival batter he was about to face: Buster Maynard, then a 36-year-old minor league veteran. Angell writes: \\"Lasorda was transfixed. 'I looked in,' he [said], 'and it was the same man!'\\" Lasorda proceeded to throw three brushback pitches at Maynard; after the third, Maynard charged the mound and a full-scale brawl nearly ensued. After the game, as Lasorda was getting into his street clothes in his team's clubhouse, there was a knock at the door. It was Maynard, who (according to Angell) wore a \\"peaceable but puzzled expression.\\" \\"'Listen, kid,' he said to Lasorda, 'did I ever meet you before?' 'Not exactly,' Tom said. 'Did I bat against you someplace, maybe?' 'Nope.' 'Well, why were you tryin' to take my head off out there?' Lasorda spread his hands wide. 'You didn't give me your autograph,' he said.\\" During his 20 years as manager of the Dodgers, Lasorda regularly told that story to his young players, advising them, \\"Always give an autograph when somebody asks you ... You can never tell. In baseball, anything can happen.\\" References External links * Category:1913 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Atlanta Crackers players Category:Augusta Tigers players Category:Baseball players from North Carolina Category:Burlington Bees (Carolina League) players Category:Charleston Rebels players Category:Danville Leafs players Category:Durham Bulls players Category:Jersey City Giants players Category:Kinston Eagles players Category:Major League Baseball outfielders Category:Minneapolis Millers (baseball) players Category:Nashville Vols players Category:New York Giants (NL) players Category:People from Henderson, North Carolina Category:Richmond Colts players Category:South Boston Twins players Category:Tampa Smokers players Category:Tarboro Serpents players ","title":"Buster Maynard"},{"id":"29568863","text":"Eugene F.

The three forts are connected by tunnels. Fort Santa Cruz was built between 1577 and 1604 by the Spaniards on the Pic d‚ÄôAidour above Gulf of Oran in the Mediterranean Sea, at an elevation of above . In 1831, the French occupied Oran and the fort. A small chapel, known as the Chapel of Santa Cruz, stands close to the fort. This chapel has been refurbished with a tower, which has a huge statue of the Virgin Mary, said to be a replica of that at Notre-Dame de la Garde in Marseilles, styled as Notre-Dame du Salut de Santa Cruz.< Geography The fort is located at a height of about on Mount Murdjadjo, also known as Pic d‚ÄôAidour, from where there are views of Mers-el-Kebir, the strategic military port of Oran. Beneath the castle, on the hill slope, is the chapel of the Blessed Virgin, which is a Catholic pilgrimage site. History The Ottomans built the first fort on the site. After the Spaniards defeated the Ottomans in the sixteenth Century, they rebuilt Fort Santa Cruz. The Spaniards ruled Oran for about 300 years till 1792. In the past, the fortress of Santa Cruz accommodated the Oran city governors. The fort city under Spanish rule continued to grow, requiring enlargement of the city walls. In spite of the improved fortifications, the city was the object of repeated attacks. Notable in this regard was when Moroccan Sharif Moulay Ismail tried to force his way past the defenses in 1707, only to see his army decimated. Oran was also hit by an earthquake in 1791, when most of the city was damaged and the Spanish who had ruled from 1509 evacuated. The French then occupied the city in 1831. Santacruz was the highest of the three forts erected by the Spanish above the town of Oran which was a dominantly Muslim town with buildings of mostly Moorish architecture. To show their dominance of \\"Crescent above the Cross\\", the local people built the Marabut chapel, opposite to the fort at a higher elevation. This chapel was crowned with a crescent on a white cupola. Spaniards held on here till 1792, after the 1791 earthquake. When the French occupied, the Muslims all migrated into the interior parts of Algeria but many returned later after Abd‚Äìel-Khader was defeated. Architecture The fort, built between 1577 and 1604, The fortifications of the place were composed of thick and continuous walls of over two and a half kilometers in circumference, surmounted by strong towers spaced between them, with a central castle or kasbah where the Spanish governor established his headquarters. The fort was built with iron, wood, sand, lime and water carried up the hill through winding and difficult paths. It was expanded repeatedly to strengthen the fortifications, the galleries passing underneath the town mounting and descending the various hills. It has a rainwater storage harvesting system, with the largest tank having a capacity of 300,000 liters. =Santa Cruz chapel= The Santa Cruz Chapel was built by the Bishop of Oran at the place where he had carried the statue of the Virgin Mary in a procession, followed by the people of the city, to the Oran hill, when a cholera epidemic had affected the people of Oran, in 1847. They sought blessings from the Virgin Mary to protect the city from the epidemic. The entire population implored the Blessed Virgin to bless the place with rain. After the rain came, the town of Oran and the region were saved from the epidemic of cholera. As a tribute to this miracle, a chapel was built on the hill at the foot of the fort of Santa Cruz. This chapel is named the Santa Cruz Church. It was considered as being the Protector of the town. In commemoration of this event, every year until Algeria became independent in 1962, Ascension Day was observed when the people of Oran and the surrounding areas paid homage to the Virgin Mary by climbing up the mountain trail to the chapel as a pilgrimage.

Medical Apartheid, Anchor Books 2006 p390 Incidents of unethical experimentation, clinical trials lacking properly informed consent, and forced medical procedures have been claimed and prosecuted. Specific incidents by date =Meningitis testing in Nigeria: 1990s= The Pfizer drug Trovan was used in a clinical trial in Kano, Nigeria. The trial compared the new antibiotic (Trovan) against the best treatment available at the time (intravenous ceftriaxone). Eleven children died in the trial: five after taking Trovan and six after taking an older antibiotic used for comparison in the clinical trial. Others suffered blindness, deafness and brain damage, the cause of which is difficult to determine because these disabilities are relatively common outcomes of the disease itself. A panel of medical experts later implicated Pfizer in the incident, concluding the drug had been administered as part of an illegal clinical trial without authorization from the Nigerian government or consent from the children's parents. This led to a lawsuit from the Nigerian government over informed consent.Washington, Harriet A. Medical Apartheid, Anchor Books 2006 p392-393 Pfizer countered that it met all the necessary regulations. The drug was approved for general use in the US, and eventually withdrawn due to hepatotoxicity. =HIV/AIDS testing in Zimbabwe: 1990s= AZT trials conducted on HIV-positive African subjects by U.S. physicians and the University of Zimbabwe were not performed with proper informed consent. The United States began testing AZT treatments in Africa in 1994, through projects funded by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It included testing of over 17,000 women for a medication that prevents mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS. The subjects did not fully understand the testing methods, the effectiveness, the possible dangers, or the nature of a placebo in testing situations. They were also told about the trials under duress. Half of these women received a placebo that has no effect, making transmission likely. As a result, an estimated 1000 babies contracted HIV/AIDS although a proven life-saving regimen already existed. The CDC ended the short course testing in 1998 after they announced they had enough information from Thailand trials. =Forced sexual reassignment in South Africa: 1970s‚Äì1980s= In a project headed by Dr. Aubrey Levin during the 1970s to 1980s, the South African Defence Force forced lesbian and gay military personnel to undergo \\"sex-change\\" operations. This was part of a secret program to purge homosexuality in the army. It included psychological coercion, chemical castration, electric shock, and other unethical medical experiments. An estimated 900 forced sexual reassignment operations may have been performed between 1971 and 1989 at military hospitals. Most of the victims were males, young 16 to 24-year-old white men who were drafted into the army during the South African Border War. Women were also subject to the experimentation. =Forced contraception in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe): 1970s= Depo-Provera was clinically tested on black Rhodesian (now Zimbabwean) women in the 1970s. Once approved, the drug was used as a birth control measure. Women on white-run commercial farms were coerced into accepting Depo- Provera.Kaler, Amy. 1998. \\"A Threat to the Nation and a Threat to the Men: the Banning of Depo-Provera in Zimbabwe, 1981\\". Journal of Southern African Studies 24(2):p 347 In 1981, the drug was banned in what was by then Zimbabwe. =Sterilisation experiments in German South-West Africa (now part of Namibia): Late 1800s‚Äì1910s= Dr. Eugen Fischer conducted sterilisation experiments on Herero women in German South-West Africa (now Namibia, less Walvis Bay etc.) in the early 1900s. His experimentation was largely done on mixed-race offspring in order to provide justification to ban mixed-race marriages.Eugen Fischer He joined the Nazi party thereafter where he did similar experiments in the Jewish concentration camps. Late stage studies were later continued by Doctor , founder of the German branch of International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) who is also associated with the compulsory sterilisation in Nazi Germany. Effects on legitimate medicine Unethical medical experimentation that has occurred for over a century may be the cause of the documented fear and mistrust of doctors and medicine in Africa. For example, polio has been on the rise in Nigeria, Chad, and Burkina Faso because many people there avoid vaccinations because they believe that the vaccines are contaminated with HIV or sterilization agents. Due to the meningitis testing incident in Kano, many Nigerians now refuse to participate in clinical trials. The role of poverty Many African nations cannot afford to offer medicine for their citizens without subsidies from multinational pharmaceutical corporations. To court these pharmaceutical corporations, some African nations minimize legal regulations on the conduct of medical research, which prevents potential legal battles from arising. This forces some Africans to make a Hobson's choice: \\"experimental medicine or no medicine at all\\".Washington, Harriet A. Medical Apartheid, Anchor Books 2006 p394 People living in the rural or slum area are also more vulnerable to experimentation because they are more likely to be illiterate and to misunderstand the effects of the experimentation. Codes of ethics Several national and international bodies have devised codes of ethics for conducting experiments and clinical trials. These include the Nuremberg Code and Helsinki DeclarationMeier, Benjamin Mason: International Protection of Persons Undergoing Medical Experimentation: Protecting the Right of Informed Consent, Berkeley Journal of International Law [1085-5718] Meier yr:2002 vol:20 iss:3 pg:513 -554 and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, which seeks to prohibit all medical and scientific experiments on women without their prior informed consent.http://allafrica.com/stories/200805290720.html Popular culture references The book and movie The Constant Gardener highlighted the dynamics of conduct in clinical trials in Africa in the slum areas. This was based on the real-life meningitis incident in Kano, Nigeria. New York Times best seller book Medical Apartheid by Harriet A.

In October 2018, the Supreme Court of Pakistan acquitted her based on insufficient evidence, though she was not allowed to leave Pakistan until the verdict was reviewed. She was held under armed guard and was not able to leave the country until 7 May 2019; she arrived in Canada the next day. In June 2009, Noreen was accused of blasphemy after an argument with co-workers while harvesting berries. She was subsequently arrested and imprisoned. In November 2010, a Sheikhupura judge sentenced her to death by hanging. The verdict was upheld by Lahore High Court and received worldwide attention. Various petitions for her release were created by organisations aiding persecuted Christians such as Voice of the Martyrs, including one that received 400,000 signatures; Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis called for the charges to be dismissed. She received less sympathy from her neighbors and Islamic religious leaders in the country, some of whom adamantly called for her to be executed. Minorities Minister Shahbaz Bhatti and Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer were both assassinated for advocating on her behalf and opposing the blasphemy laws. Noreen's family went into hiding after receiving death threats, some of which threatened to kill Noreen if released from prison. Muslim cleric Maulana Yousaf Qureshi announced a bounty of to anyone who would kill her. On 31 October 2018, the Supreme Court of Pakistan acquitted Noreen, citing \\"material contradictions and inconsistent statements of the witnesses\\" which \\"cast a shadow of doubt on the prosecution's version of facts.\\" The decision sparked protests headed by Islamist parties in major cities of the country, but was praised by human rights groups and those advocating on behalf of Christian minorities, such as International Christian Concern, Open Doors and Aid to the Church in Need. On 2 November 2018, however, the Government of Pakistan signed an agreement with the Tehreek-e- Labbaik political party (TLP), which was leading the protests; this agreement barred Noreen from leaving the country. It led to accusations that the executive was capitulating to extremists. Italy, Canada, as well as other Western countries worked to help her leave Pakistan. On 7 November 2018, she was released from the New Jail for Women in Multan. However, by Christmas, she was reported to have spent Christmas Day in some form of custody. On 29 January 2019, a petition requesting an appeal against the court's decision to acquit Noreen was rejected, \\"lifting the last legal hurdle in the case and paving the way for her to leave the country.\\" On 11 April 2019, Prime Minister Imran Khan (who had previously attacked hardliners appealing them to be calm) stated that a \\"complication\\" had delayed her departure from the country. On 8 May 2019, she landed in Canada and was reported to be doing well. The blasphemy law in Pakistan has resulted in the extrajudicial killings, incited by accusations, of over 60 people, has been blamed for dozens of communal attacks that have taken place against religious minorities on the pretext of blasphemy; it has been used by individuals as a tool for revenge against other people. Noreen was the first woman in Pakistan to be sentenced to death for blasphemy and would have been the first person in Pakistan to be executed for blasphemy under the current law. Background and arrest (2009‚Äì2010) Aasiya Noreen was born and raised in Ittan Wali, a small, rural village in the Sheikhupura District of Punjab, Pakistan, thirty miles outside of Lahore. Poor Christians in the district, and elsewhere in Pakistan, often have lower-class occupations such as cleaning and sweeping. Noreen, who is a Roman Catholic, worked as a farmhand in Sheikhupura to support her family. She married Ashiq Masih, a brick laborer who had three children from a previous marriage, and had two children with him. Noreen and her family were the only Christians in the village. Before her incarceration, she had been repeatedly urged by her fellow workers to convert to Islam. In June 2009, Noreen was harvesting falsa berries with a group of other women farmhands in a field in Sheikhupura. She was asked at one point to fetch water from a nearby well; she complied but stopped to take a drink with an old metal cup she had found lying next to the well. A neighbor of Noreen, Musarat, who had been involved in a running feud with Noreen's family about some property damage, saw her and angrily told her that it was forbidden for a Christian to drink water from the same utensil from which Muslims drink, and that some of the other workers considered her to be unclean because she was a Christian, referring to the caste system in Pakistan. Noreen recounts that when they made derogatory statements about Christianity and demanded that she convert to Islam, she responded, \\"I believe in my religion and in Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for the sins of mankind. What did your Prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind? And why should it be me that converts instead of you?\\" An argument ensued. A mob came to her house, beating her and members of her family before she was taken away by the police. The police initiated an investigation about her remarks, resulting in her arrest under Section 295 C of the Pakistan Penal Code. In an interview with CNN, local police officer Muhammad Ilyas claimed that Noreen said that \\"the Quran is fake and your prophet remained in bed for one month before his death because he had worms in his ears and mouth. He married Khadija just for money and after looting her kicked her out of the house\\". Village Imam Qari Muhammad Salim, to whom Noreen's coworkers reported the alleged blasphemy, claimed that Noreen confessed to him and apologized. On the other hand, the Asian Human Rights Commission published a letter that stated: She was subsequently imprisoned for over a year before being formally charged. Prosecution and imprisonment Noreen denied that she had committed blasphemy and said that she had been accused by her neighbor to \\"settle an old score\\". In November 2010, Muhammed Naveed Iqbal, a judge at the court of Sheikhupura, Punjab, sentenced her to death by hanging. Additionally, a fine of the equivalent of $1,100 was imposed. With the verdict, she became the first woman condemned to death in Pakistan on blasphemy charges. Noreen described the day of her sentencing as follows: Noreen's husband, Ashiq Masih, 51 years old at the time,. announced that he planned to appeal the verdict, which has to be upheld by the Lahore High Court. A month later, Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab who investigated the affair for President Asif Ali Zardari, stated that Noreen would most likely be pardoned if the High Court did not suspend the sentence. Zardari was poised to grant pardon, but the High Court issued a stay order against a potential presidential pardon, which remains in force to date. Court transcripts showed numerous inconsistencies in the evidence presented, and reporters said they dare not repeat Noreen's testimony lest they also be accused of blasphemy. Noreen was put in solitary confinement in an cell without windows at the Lahore prison. Before his assassination, Taseer visited her at the jail several times with his wife, Aamna, and daughter, Shehrbano, though Pakistani court officials later ruled that she could be visited only by her husband and lawyer. Khalid Sheikh, the prison superintendent, said that while he wanted her to be treated \\"like any other prisoner\\", she had to be kept away from other inmates for her own well-being, as other individuals accused of blasphemy had been killed while in prison. The Masihi Foundation, a human rights group, described her physical condition as \\"very frail\\", and her health was reported to be in decline due to poor living conditions at the jail. She has also been threatened by other inmates and subjected to physical abuse from prison guards. According to Human Rights Watch, Noreen's situation is not unusual. Though no one has been executed for blasphemy yet in Pakistan, the accused often remain imprisoned for a long time while the case is being processed. In May 2014, Noreen's appeal hearing was delayed for the fifth time. =Local reaction= Noreen's conviction led to divided opinions on the blasphemy laws and drew strong reactions from the public. Pakistani Human Rights Watch researcher Ali Dayan Hasan said, \\"The law creates this legal infrastructure which is then used in various informal ways to intimidate, coerce, harass and persecute.\\" He further described the law as \\"discriminatory and abusive\\". Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer and Pakistan's Minority Affairs Minister Shahbaz Bhatti both publicly supported Noreen, with the latter saying, \\"I will go to every knock for justice on her behalf and I will take all steps for her protection.\\" She also received support from Pakistani political scientist Rasul Baksh Rais and local priest Samson Dilawar. The imprisonment of Noreen left Christians and other minorities in Pakistan feeling vulnerable, and liberal Muslims were also unnerved by her sentencing. The general population was less sympathetic towards Noreen. Several signs were erected in Sheikhupura and other rural areas declaring support for the blasphemy laws, including one that called for Noreen to be beheaded. Mohammad Saleem, a member of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan party, organized a demonstration in Rawalpindi and led a small crowd chanting, \\"Hang her, hang her.\\" In December 2010, a month after Noreen's conviction, Maulana Yousaf Qureshi, the Muslim cleric of the Mohabaat Khan Mosque in Peshawar, announced a Pakistani rupee bounty to anyone who would kill her. One survey reported that around 10 million Pakistanis had said that they would be willing to personally kill her out of either religious conviction or for the reward. The village mosque in Ittan Wali was reportedly indifferent towards Noreen's plight; its imam, who helped register the case against her, Qari Mohammed Salim, stated that he had wept for joy on learning that she had been sentenced to death and threatened that some people would \\"take the law into their own hands\\" should she be pardoned or released. However, journalist Julie McCarthy suggested that the country's \\"more peaceful majority views\\" had been overshadowed by the more vocal fundamentalists. Noreen's family has received threats and has gone into hiding. Ashiq, her husband, stated that he was afraid to let their children go outside. He also expressed concern about how Noreen would be kept safe should she be released, saying, \\"No one will let her live. The mullahs are saying they will kill her when she comes out.\\" Her family declined to leave the country while she remained in prison. Italy, France, and Spain all offered to grant her and her family asylum in the event of her release. Assassinations of Taseer and Bhatti Salmaan Taseer On 4 January 2011, at Kohsar Market of Islamabad, governor of Punjab Salmaan Taseer was assassinated by Malik Mumtaz Hussein Qadri, a 26-year-old member of his security team, because of his defence of Noreen and opposition to the blasphemy law. Mumtaz Qadri was sentenced to death for the assassination and hanged on 29 February 2016. Taseer was outspoken in his criticism of the law and the verdict in Noreen's case. The next day, thousands turned up for the governor's funeral in Lahore in spite of warnings by the Taliban and some clerics, while a portion of the Pakistani population also praised Qadri as a hero; thousands of Sunni Muslims rallied in support of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan after the murder, and 500 Barelvi clerics prohibited their followers from sending condolences to the family of Taseer. This resulted in concerns that the public was becoming tolerant of extremists. Prison officials said that Noreen \\"wept inconsolably\\" on learning of Taseer's assassination while repeatedly saying, \\"That man came here and he sacrificed his life for me.\\" Father Andrew Nisari, a senior Catholic spokesperson in Lahore, described the situation as \\"utter chaos\\". Seven months later, in August 2011, Taseer's 28-year-old son, Shahbaz, was kidnapped. Shahbaz Taseer was later found or released in March 2016, and he returned to Lahore on 9 March after five years in captivity. Minority Affairs Minister Shahbaz Bhatti said that he was first threatened with death in June 2010 when he was told that he would be beheaded if he attempted to change the blasphemy laws. In response, he told reporters that he was \\"committed to the principle of justice for the people of Pakistan\\" and willing to die fighting for Noreen's release. On 2 March 2011, Bhatti was shot dead by gunmen who ambushed his car near his residence in Islamabad, presumably because of his position on the blasphemy laws. He had been the only Christian member of Pakistan's cabinet. =International response= Noreen's death sentence drew international outrage and strong condemnation from non-governmental organizations defending persecuted Christians, as well as human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch who saw the blasphemy laws as a form of religious persecution and called for them to be abolished. Pope Benedict XVI publicly called for clemency for Noreen. In his statement, he described his \\"spiritual closeness\\" with Noreen and urged that the \\"human dignity and fundamental rights of everyone in similar situations\\" be respected. Her case also achieved extensive media coverage, and American journalist John L. Allen, Jr. wrote that she is \\"almost certainly the most famous illiterate Punjabi farm worker and mother of five on the planet\\". According to Allen, she has become a celebrity among Christian activists, an unusual instance when cases of discrimination against Christian minorities typically receive little attention in the press. A number of campaigns have been organized to protest her imprisonment through online petitions, Twitter trends, and concerts. Ooberfuse, a Christian pop band based in the United Kingdom collaborated with the British Pakistani Christian Association, and released a song titled \\"Free Asia Bibi\\" with a music video that included \\"a disturbing visual portrayal of the squalid prison conditions where Bibi is being held\\". She has also been the subject of books and documentaries. One petition created by the Voice of the Martyrs, an organisation aiding persecuted Christians, received over 400,000 signatures from individuals from over 100 countries. Another petition, organised by the American Center for Law & Justice (ACLJ), obtained over 200,000 signatures and called for America's aid to Pakistan (said to be cumulatively eight billion dollars) to stop whilst persecution of minorities is allowed in that country. Umar Al-Qadri, an Islamic cleric in Ireland, called for Noreen's release and stated he would back organisations wishing the same, holding that, \\"Asia Bibi is a case where the lady is denying that she committed blasphemy, and based on that it would be sufficient for the court to release her, but unfortunately that particular law, the blasphemy law in Pakistan, does not represent the true Islamic teaching\\". Appeals (2014‚Äì2017) On 16 October 2014, the Lahore High Court dismissed Noreen's appeal and upheld her death sentence. On 20 November 2014, her husband appealed to the President of Pakistan for clemency. On 24 November 2014, her lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. On 22 July 2015, the Supreme Court suspended Noreen's death sentence for the duration of the appeals process. In November 2015, her lead attorney, Naeem Shakir, announced that, after two postponements in 2015, the Supreme Court would hear an appeal in Noreen's case on 26 March 2016. The hearing was rescheduled for 13 October 2016, but on that morning when it was the turn of the case \\"Asia Bibi against the state\\", one of the three members of the bench of judges of that section ‚Äì Iqbal Hameedur Rehman ‚Äì refused to be part of the bench, which led to the postponement of the hearing to an undetermined date. The Judge later resigned in a handwritten letter addressed to Mamnoon Hussain, the President of Pakistan, without stating any specific reasons for his resignation. On 26 April 2017, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Mian Saqib Nisar declined a request for the early hearing of the case in the first week of June made by her lawyer Saiful Malook. Supreme Court acquittal (October 2018) Asia's lawyer Saif Ul Malook spoke about the case at the Secular Conference on 25 November 2018, invited by Maryam Namazie shortly after he fled to the Netherlands. On 8 October 2018, a three-judge bench comprising CJP Mian Saqib Nisar, Justice Asif Saeed Khosa and Justice Mazhar Alam reserved its judgement on the final legal appeal. On 31 October 2018, the Supreme Court in a 56-page detailed judgement authored by Nisar, with a separate concurring opinion note from Khosa, acquitted Asia Bibi of blasphemy charges after accepting her 2015 appeal against her sentence. The court also ruled that \\"she was free to go, if not wanted in connection with any other case\\". In his verdict, Khosa noted: The final judgement said that one of Noreen's accusers violated the Ashtiname of Muhammad, a \\"covenant made by Muhammad with Christians in the seventh century but still valid today\\". Khosa also stated that the two women who made accusations against Noreen \\"had no regard for the truth\\" and that the claim that she blasphemed Muhammad in public was a \\"concoction incarnate\\". The Supreme Court of Pakistan's ruling cited \\"material contradictions and inconsistent statements of the witnesses\\" that \\"cast a shadow of doubt on the prosecution's version of facts.\\" Asia Noreen was reading the Bible when she heard the news, upon which she exclaimed: \\"I can't believe what I am hearing, will I go out now? Will they let me out, really? ... I just don't know what to say, I am very happy, I can't believe it.\\" Noreen's daughter Eisham Ashiq, said that the news of the acquittal was \\"the most wonderful moment in my life ... I want to hug my mother and then celebrate with my family. I am grateful to God for listening to our prayers.\\" =Domestic response and challenge to the acquittal= In response to the verdict, Islamist groups protested in the streets of Pakistan, \\"blocking roads and damaging infrastructure\\". The Supreme Court decision sparked protests in Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar and Multan. JUI-F chief Fazal-ur-Rehman called for \\"peaceful\\" protests, stating that Noreen's release was \\"not acceptable at any cost\\". Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Khadim Hussain Rizvi and Jamaat-i-Ahle Hadees also called for protests. Protesters belonging to the TLP party said traffic will \\"remain blocked until Asia Bibi is hanged\\". and Islamabad's main highway was blocked by \\"approximately a thousand club-wielding demonstrators\\". Muhammad Afzal Qadri, a TLP co-founder, also called for the death of the three Supreme Court justices involved in hearing the appeal, stating: \\"The Chief Justice and two others deserve to be killed ... Either their security guards, their drivers, or their chefs should kill them.\\" The Red Zone of Islamabad was sealed off from the public in order to keep protesters away, with paramilitary forces being deployed to this end. Prime Minister Imran Khan, in a televised address to the nation on the Asia Bibi verdict, issued a stark warning to the groups that were agitating against the decision. He concluded his address stating, \\"do not take the state to a point where it has no option but to take action\\". On 1 November, the National Highways and Motorway Police advised commuters to \\"refrain from travelling on motorways and national highways\\" on account of \\"the law & order situation across the country\\". Christian schools in Lahore \\"closed indefinitely\\" for safety reasons following the protests. The government of Pakistan also shut down mobile phone networks on 2 November. Before the announcement of the acquittal on 31 October, Christians in Pakistan fasted and prayed. Cardinal Joseph Coutts, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Karachi, prayed that \\"there may not be a violent reaction from the extremists\\". Saif-ul-Mulook, the lawyer who defended Asia Noreen, states that \\"his life has not been the same since; he rarely socialises, lives in a constant state of hypervigilance and has been inundated with threats.\\" The South China Morning Post and Christian Today reported that he is now an \\"easy target\\" for extremists. On 3 November 2018, he was reported as \\"having fled\\" the country, to the Netherlands. Saif-ul-Mulook maintains that the United Nations \\"kept me for three days and then put me on a plane against my wishes\\" as he \\"refused to leave the country without ensuring that his client was out of prison.\\" Religious hardliners petitioned to overturn the acquittal. =International response= The decision was praised by human rights groups and organizations advocating for persecuted Christians, such as International Christian Concern, Open Doors, and Aid to the Church in Need. CEO of Open Doors David Curry, said: \\"We are breathing a sigh of relief today ... as these charges stemmed from her Christian identity as well as false accusations against her. We are hopeful that Pakistan will now take additional steps to offer religious freedom and basic human rights throughout the country.\\" Omar Waraich, Amnesty International's Deputy South Asia Director, described the ruling as a \\"landmark verdict\\". Neville Kyrke-Smith of Aid to the Church in Need proclaimed with respect to Noreen's acquittal: \\"Today is like the dawn of new hope for oppressed minorities.\\" The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan issued a statement on 1 November welcoming the acquittal, stating that \\"From a human rights perspective, the Supreme Court's detailed judgement underlines several of the most problematic aspects of applying the blasphemy laws. The presumption of innocence is too easily buried by moral outrage, which invariably pits the vulnerable and underprivileged against those in majority.\\" Olav Fykse Tveit, general secretary of the World Council of Churches, \\"received with joy\\" news of the acquittal, stating: \\"We celebrate her acquittal and release together with her, her family and community ... The WCC has repeatedly called for justice for Asia Bibi, convicted 8 years ago on charges resulting from a village argument in which she was accused by her neighbours of blasphemy. ... WCC therefore appeals once again to the Government of Pakistan to review its blasphemy laws, to curb their abuse, and to eliminate discriminatory bias against religious minorities.\\" : UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said that because of the organization's long-standing opposition to the death penalty, it \\"would welcome this latest development\\". : Theresa May, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, stated that \\"the news would be welcomed around the world, and the UK was committed to the global abolition of the death penalty.\\" According to the British Pakistani Christian Association, Noreen appealed to Britain for asylum but was denied because her presence in the country might stir unrest among \\"certain sections of the population\\". : Tenzin Dorjee, chair of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), lauded the ruling, saying: \\"The case of Asia Bibi illustrates the extent to which blasphemy laws can be exploited to target minority communities. These laws seek to protect entire religions rather than the individual, as should be the case under international human rights standards. It is deeply troubling that Bibi's case even reached this level, where she almost became the first person in Pakistan's history to be executed for the crime of blasphemy.\\" : Marine Le Pen, president of the National Rally in France called on her government to grant Asia Noreen asylum. The European branch of the American Center for Law and Justice lauded the ruling as well, and advocated the \\"abolition of the crime of blasphemy in Pakistan\\". Several countries, including France and Spain, have offered Asia Noreen asylum.  Bar from leaving Pakistan (November 2018) On 2 November 2018, the Government of Pakistan under the administration of Imran Khan and the Islamist Tehreek-e-Labbaik political party, which encouraged the protests against Noreen, came to an agreement that barred her from leaving the country, in addition to releasing Tehreek-e-Labbaik protesters. Noor-ul-Haq Qadri, the religious affairs minister, and Muhammad Basharat Raja, Punjab's minister for law, signed the agreement on behalf of the government. The deal included expediting a motion in the court to place Asia Noreen on Pakistan's no fly list, known officially as the Exit Control List (ECL). Pakistani authorities would not release Asia Noreen until the \\"Supreme Court makes a final review of its verdict\\" as \\"Ghulam Mustafa, the lawyer representing a provincial cleric in Punjab who had filed the initial blasphemy charges against Noreen, petitioned the Supreme Court requesting that the judges review her acquittal.\\" Similar reviews have taken years to process. The TLP agreed to end its three- day protest sit-ins across the country and its leaders asked the protesters to disperse peacefully. A plane from the United Kingdom reportedly arrived to pick up Asia Noreen after her acquittal, but returned without her, as the Pakistani government then still had her under detention as a result of the agreement with Tehreek-e-Labbaik. Wilson Chowdhry, chairman of the British Pakistani Christian Association (BPCA), stated that \\"placing Asia Bibi on the ECL is like signing her death warrant\\" and Sardar Mushtaq Gill, head of the Legal Evangelical Association Development (LEAD), attributed the government's reluctance to act both to fear of hardliners‚Äô response and to sentiment within its own ranks. . This agreement between the Government of Pakistan and Tehreek-e-Labbaik led to \\"allegations [that] the government was capitulating to extremists\\". Pakistani Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry responded to these allegations, saying that \\"We had two options; either to use force, and when you use force people can be killed, and that is not something a state should do, or second, we tried negotiations and (in) negotiations you take something and you leave something.\\" Asia Noreen's lawyer Saif-ul-Mulook called the agreement between the Government of Pakistan and the Islamists \\"painful\\", stating that \\"They cannot even implement an order of the country's highest court\\". Feeling that his life was threatened, Mulook fled to Europe in order \\"to stay alive as I still have to fight the legal battle for Asia Bibi\\". BPCA chairman Wilson Chowdhry likewise stated that \\"I am not surprised that Imran Khan's regime has caved in to extremists\\". Jemima Goldsmith, an ex-wife of Imran Khan, similarly \\"said that Pakistan's government caved in to extremist demands to bar Asia Bibi from leaving the country\\", opining: \\"Not the Naya Pakistan we'd hoped for. 3 days after a defiant & brave speech defending the judiciary, Pakistan's government caves in to extremist demands to bar Asia Bibi from leaving Pakistan, after she was acquitted of blasphemy ‚Äì effectively signing her death warrant.\\" Ashiq Masih, Noreen's husband, appealed to US president Donald Trump, as well as British prime minister Theresa May and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, to \\"help the family leave the country\\" and grant them asylum. He told the charity Aid to the Church in Need, an organisation that aids persecuted Christians: \\"Help us get out of Pakistan. We are extremely worried because our lives are in danger. We no longer have even anything to eat, because we cannot leave the house to buy food\\". On 7 November 2018, a release order arrived at the New Jail for Women, in which Noreen was incarcerated in Multan. Local news reported that she had been flown to PAF Base Nur Khan and would depart the country on a charter plane to the Netherlands. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the media reports that she had left Pakistan, stating that she was \\"in a safe place in Pakistan\\". Hafiz Shahbaz Attari of the Islamist political party Tehreek-e- Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), upon hearing the news, said that TLP members would gather in Islamabad and Rawalpindi and try to prevent her departure. Another TLP leader Afzal Qadri, stated that \\"officials told the group that Noreen would not be allowed to leave until the Supreme Court ruled on their appeal of her acquittal\\". British member of Parliament Mike Gapes, then of the Labour and Co-operative Party, suggested in November 2018 that the UK should reassess their relationship with Pakistan, and Rehman Chishti resigned as Britain's trade envoy to Pakistan in the same month, partially in protest to the government's refusal to offer Noreen asylum. US senator Rand Paul spoke to President Donald Trump about securing asylum for Noreen in that nation. Noreen was reported to have spent Christmas 2018 in custody. Joseph Nadeem, the man guarding her husband and family, said that Islamists had fired at the gate of their home and that they had to move five times in order to evade them. = International reaction and response = : Antonio Tajani, President of the European Parliament, stated: \\"The European Parliament is extremely concerned for your safety as well as your family's, due to the violence by extremist elements in Pakistan.\\" Tajani sent a letter to Noreen's husband, inviting his family to \\"Brussels or Strasbourg for a meeting about how I can concretely facilitate the release of your wife, Asia Bibi\\". : Matteo Salvini, Deputy Prime Minister, stated: \\"I want women and children whose lives are at risk to be able to have a secure future, in our country or in other Western countries, so I will do everything humanly possible to guarantee that [for Bibi] ... It is not permissible that in 2018 someone can risk losing their life for a ... hypothesis of blasphemy\\". Salvini further stated that \\"Italy had nothing against the Pakistani government\\" but that the \\"enemy is violence, extremism and fanaticism\\". : Chrystia Freeland, Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated\\" \\"It's a very important issue, a central priority for our government ... Canada calls on Pakistan to take all measures necessary to ensure the safety and security of Asia Bibi and her family ... Canada is prepared to do everything we can and is extremely engaged in this issue.\\" : Peter Dutton, Minister for Home Affairs, said that Australia will offer asylum to Noreen.  Acquittal upheld (January 2019) On 29 January 2019, Pakistan's Supreme Court upheld the acquittal on blasphemy charges and ruled that she was now free to leave Pakistan, where she was facing death threats, and join members of her family who were (according to unconfirmed reports) already abroad. Violent protests erupted across Pakistan, demanding the execution of the judge and Noreen. While her lawyer, who escaped to Germany, said that Asia was in Canada, others allege that she was being held in a secret location in Islamabad and that it is not clear when she would leave or where she would go. France, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and Australia were among the countries who offered her asylum. In the Pakistani city of Faizabad, fifty-five people were arrested during a protest of the decision to uphold the Supreme Court's acquittal decision.  Present status  On 8 May 2019, Noreen arrived in Canada, where she was reunited with her family who had previously arrived in the country before her. International Christian Concern, an organisation long advocating for her release, released a statement saying that \\"Our prayers are now with Asia and her family as they seek peace and security in a new country\\". In 2020, she claimed asylum in France. In February 2020, Asia Bibi was interviewed by Open Doors in Paris, where she shared her feelings about her life and how her Christian faith helped her through her imprisonment that was a result of a false accusation. A Barelvi mosque was built in 2014 in Islamabad named after Mumtaz Qadri, who assassinated the Punjab governor Salman Taseer for defending Noreen. Qadri was convicted by the Islamabad High Court, sentenced to death and hanged in February 2016. Memoirs French journalist assisted Noreen in writing a memoir titled Blasphemy: A Memoir: Sentenced to Death over a Cup of Water (2013, ). Noreen is illiterate, and Tollet was unable to visit her directly due to prison restrictions. She conducted interviews through Noreen's husband, who passed questions and answers between them. Tollet also met other members of Noreen's family, including her children and sister, and had known Shahbaz Bhatti before his assassination. In August 2020, she distanced herself from the memoir, stating that she was not involved in its planning, did not recognize the story as hers, and did not agree with its conclusions regarding Pakistani law. In 2015, Polish filmmakers, inspired by the memoir, produced the film Uwolniƒá Asiƒô Bibi ('Freedom for Asia Bibi).

The ad gained international attention for its characterization of Fiorina's opponent as a wolf in sheep's clothing, portrayed by a man wearing a sheep costume with glowing red eyes. Although opinion remains divided as to the effectiveness of the ad in supporting Fiorina's campaign, it is widely regarded as one of the most bizarre and memorable political advertisements ever devised. Background In 2010, Carly Fiorina, a businesswoman then best known as the former chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard from 1999 to 2005, entered the race for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat then held by Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Among her opponents was Tom Campbell, a former congressman who had served five terms in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1989 and 2001, representing California's 12th and 15th congressional districts. Early polling suggested that Campbell held a substantial lead over Fiorina. For a promotional ad opposing Campbell, the Fiorina campaign turned to Fred Davis, an advertising executive who had gained notoriety for his 2008 ad depicting then presidential candidate Barack Obama as a celebrity akin to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. The ad, released on Fiorina's campaign website in February 2010, quickly gained international attention.\\"Fiorina's 'Demon Sheep' Went Down In Political Ad Infamy\\", from National Public Radio's It's All Politics: Political News from NPR, 7 May 2015www.npr.org. The Demon Sheep The ad, which runs about three minutes and twenty seconds, opens with an idyllic scene of sheep running and grazing in a sunny meadow, as a female narrator extols the supposed virtues of fiscally conservative politicians: \\"purity, piety: our fiscal conservative leaders. Men we admire; aspire to be: wholesome, honorable, true believers. Men like Tom Campbell, who would never lead us astray; his pedestal, so high...\\" From behind the hillside, a cut-out animation in the style of Terry Gilliam depicts a sheep rising into the sky on top of a Doric column. Suddenly, the sky darkens, storm clouds roll in, and lightning strikes the pillar, which vanishes. The sheep then tumbles end-over-end in slow motion, as ominous music begins to play, and the original narrator gives way to a stern male voice (veteran actor Robert Davi), questioning Campbell's record and credentials as a fiscal conservative. The next part of the ad blames Campbell, who was California's Director of Finance from 2004 to 2005, for California's budget woes, as images of Campbell are alternated with footage of sheets of money being printed, played at increasing speed, and images of pigs, sheep, out-of-business signs, and a close-up of the word \\"deficit\\" in a dictionary. The narrator asks, \\"who would remember the Tom Campbell Budget?\\" as pictures of people from various walks of life appear, each of them wearing a concerned expression; the narrator answers his own question: \\"we would.\\" As hundred- dollar bills float by in the background, the narrator castigates Campbell for having supported various taxes, especially an increase in the gasoline tax, proposed following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08. Images of Campbell now alternate with footage of a sheep chewing its cud at increasingly rapid speeds. In a sarcastic tone of voice, the narrator repeatedly asks \\"Tom\\" whether his actions or stances on various issues were \\"fiscally conservative\\". Campbell's support for other taxes, and having been \\"critical of the Bush tax cuts\\" are also mentioned, as an image of Carly Fiorina's signature on the Taxpayer Protection Pledge appears. The ad calls Campbell the \\"only Republican candidate\\" not to sign the pledge. At this point, the ad returns to footage of sheep in a meadow, and Campbell is described as an \\"FCINO: Fiscal Conservative In Name Only\\", while a man wearing a sheep costume with glowing red eyes peers out from behind a tree. The \\"Demon Sheep\\" then crawls on his hands and knees amongst the flock, pretending to eat grass, and repeatedly making sinister glances at the camera. The narrator explicitly calls Campbell a wolf in sheep's clothing, who has set California on the path to \\"bankruptcy and higher taxes,\\" as the words \\"has he fooled you?\\" appear in the foreground. The narrator asks, \\"might there be a better choice?\\" The ad abruptly changes tone, shifting to an office setting, with an unnamed woman in a business suit meeting with clients. The woman is seen only indirectly, but implied to be Carly Fiorina, and the narrator describes her in an approving voice, as a hard-working and proven fiscal conservative. The ad closes with dramatic music and the address of Fiorina's campaign website. Reception Although the full ad was never broadcast on television, it rapidly garnered national and international attention, and was featured on broadcast news as an example of an ad that was either absurdly juvenile or a brilliant lampoon, depending on one's point of view. Slate's Christopher Bream described it as \\"confusing and sloppy.\\"Christopher Bream, \\"Violence of the Lambs: the weird genius behind Carly Fiorina's \\"demon sheep\\" ad\\", in Slate, 4 February 2010. Jason Linkins of The Huffington Post called it \\"Bonkers.\\" National Public Radio's Jessica Taylor describes it as \\"one of the most infamous political ads of all time.\\" Michael Scherer of Time suggested viewing the ad \\"by pressing play on your cassette tape of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of The Moon just as you click play on YouTube.\\" However, New York Times columnist Gail Collins refers to it as \\"one of the all-time great attack videos,\\"Gail Collins, \\"Beyond the Demon Sheep\\", The New York Times, 7 May 2015. and The Week asks whether the \\"Demon Sheep\\" was \\"the best bad campaign ad ever.\\"\\"The best bad campaign ad ever? Relive Carly Fiorina's glowing-eyed demon sheep video\\" in The Week, 4 May 2015. Aftermath The ad initially appeared to backfire, as Campbell's poll numbers showed his lead over Fiorina increasing after the ad was released.Jason Linkins, \\"Campbell Surges Ahead In CA Senate Race, Despite/Because Of Bonkers Demon Sheep Ad\\", in The Huffington Post, 28 April 2010www.huffingtonpost.com. But either because, or perhaps in spite of the \\"Demon Sheep\\" ad, Fiorina soon pulled ahead and defeated Campbell in the Republican primary by a wide margin. For her campaign against Barbara Boxer, Davis created another memorable ad, depicting Boxer \\"as a bloated, power- hungry blimp floating over the Capitol and California.\\" However, in the general election, Fiorina lost to the Democratic incumbent by ten percentage points. Fiorina would later seek the Republican nomination for President in the 2016 election. Also in the 2010 election cycle, Davis created a spot for Christine O'Donnell, the Republican nominee for the special Senate election in Delaware, featuring her denying that she was a witch. She lost by a wide margin in the general election.

The Werribee Bears play in the Victorian Rugby League competition. They have teams entered in both the Senior and Junior Competition in the VRL. They also have a Senior Women's and Junior Girls Rugby League OzTag team. Club history 260x260px The Werribee Bears Rugby League Club was first established in 2008 by Rangi Tiananga. Rangi had an idea that he wanted to start a rugby league club in Werribee as he saw the need of a different code to be started in the Wyndham District area, as it was dominated by AFL/VFL footy clubs, Soccer clubs and one Rugby club. but there were no Rugby League club in the area. With the help of his son Aaron Tiananga, the idea was put into reality. News of a new rugby league club being established in the Werribee area spread fast. There was a lot of interest from people in the community that wanted to be involved with the club. The first step was to come up with a name. The name Werribee Bears was chosen because a Bear represents Strength which represents the strength as an individual, as a team and as a club. In May 2008 the club approached the Victorian Rugby League Association (VRL) to be affiliated with as they ran the Victorian Rugby League Competition. The club first entered the 2009 season as it was too late to enter the team in the 2008 season because it had already started. In June 2008 the club was now Incorporated with the Victorian Consumers Affairs under the name \\"Werribee Bears Rugby League Sports Club Inc\\". The club was also registered with an Australian Business Number (ABN) and Tax file number. In July 2008 a large number of players showed their interest in playing for the Werribee Bears senior side. The first training session was held on 8 July and over 30 players turned up every Sunday for training. Due to this the Victorian Rugby League (VRL) gave the club four exhibition matches to play during the 2008 season which was a great way to introduce the Werribee Bears into the VRL and to give the players a taste for what was to come in the 2009 season. The main goal of the Werribee Bears is first and foremost to make it a family orientated club and to have its doors open to anyone who wishes to be a member, supporter or volunteer with Werribee Bears Rugby League Club.

The company originally produced magnetic recording read/write heads for the then- burgeoning floppy-drive market. Due to the labor-intensive nature of the product, production was carried out in low-wage India which was the key to the company's competitiveness. In the late 1970s, Tandon developed direct equivalents to Shugart floppy drives, and is credited with the invention of DS/DD (double-sided, double-density) versions\\"Magnetic recording device for double sided media: Sirjang L. Tandon et al\\", Patent number: 4151573, Filing date: Jun 13, 1977, Issue date: Apr 24, 1979 which became its primary product in the early 1980s. In 1979, Tandon introduced the TM-100 diskette drive, a 5.25\\" unit with 40 track support as opposed to the Shugart SA-400's 35 tracks. When Tandy introduced the TRS-80 Model III in 1980, they equipped the computer with TM-100s. The following year, Tandon obtained an even more lucrative contract when IBM released its Personal Computer. Until 1985, Tandon were the sole supplier of floppy drives for IBM PCs, initially the same single-sided unit used in the TRS-80, then the newer double-sided TM-100-2. Tandon would become the world's largest independent producer of disk drives for personal computers and word processors. In the mid-1980s, Tandon introduced a line of hard disk drives, making several models of the same basic design with a P shaped top cover and a pinion rack stepper motor off to the side. They also introduced portable hard disk drives that could be easily removed from personal computers. A major decline in North American computer sales during 1984‚Äì85 as well as competition from Japanese and Taiwanese manufacturers proved difficult for the company. Tandon sold its original data-storage business to Western Digital for nearly $80 million in 1988. The company then brought in former IBM and other computer industry executives in an attempt to remake the company as a leading producer of personal computers. By 1989, nearly all (90 percent) of its personal computer sales were in Europe, and its stock price had fallen from a 1983 peak of $34.25 to $0.50. PCX Tandon PCX The PCX computer was made in 1986.

Aimery visited the monastery that year to confirm his father's grants to it. The inscription may have been set up during his visit. Aimery (or Aimeric) III (died February 1239), known in Spanish as Aimerico P√©rez de Lara, was the Viscount of Narbonne from 1194 until his own death. He was a member of the House of Lara. Throughout his reign he had to navigate competing claims of suzerainty over him and until 1223 his reign was dominated by the Occitan War. He participated unenthusiastically on the side of the crusaders, but retained his viscounty, which he passed on to his son. Aimery and his father On the abdication of Viscountess Ermengard in 1192, her nephew and heir, Pedro Manrique de Lara, a nobleman from Castile, travelled to Narbonne to receive the viscounty and then bestow it on his second son, Aimery, along with the suzerainty over the Viscount of B√©ziers (1194). Only the castle of Montpesat and its vicinity was reserved for Pedro as a foothold north of the Pyrenees. Aimery immediately recognised the suzerainty of Count Raymond V of Toulouse and received the homage of his own vassals.Antonio S√°nchez de Mora, La nobleza castellana en la plena Edad Media: el linaje de Lara (SS. XI‚ÄìXIII), Doctoral Thesis (University of Seville, 2003), 344. For the medieval concepts of suzerainty, homage, fealty, fiefs and vassalage, see feudalism. In 1202, shortly after the death of his father, Aimery visited the Abbey of Huerta, which Pedro had founded, in Castile. There he confirmed all the gifts and concessions made by his father and decreed that if he were to die south of the Pyrenees he wished to be buried at Huerta. In the charter he had drawn up to confirm the abbey's possessions he styled himself a \\"son of the lord count Pedro and the lady infanta Sancha, by the grace of God viscount of Narbonne.\\" The title infanta used of his mother connected Aimery to royalty by identifying his mother as a royal princess, the daughter of King Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez of Navarre. The formula \\"by the grace of God\\" indicated his claim of a divine right to rule and its use was initiated in his family by his father.S√°nchez de Mora, La nobleza castellana, 344‚Äì45. Upon his return to France, Aimery swore fealty to Raymond V for all the lands of Narbonne, including Montpesat, which he had inherited, and all the other lands which Pedro had given to the count and received back as fiefs. This act by Pedro had probably ensured Toulousain acceptance of his son's accession. Crusades in southern France and Spain In 1209 the Albigensian Crusade (‚ÄúOccitan War‚Äù) visited the south of France. Pressured by Odo III, Duke of Burgundy, and Herv√©, Count of Nevers, the viscount of Narbonne bowed to a Papal command and assisted the crusaders with money, supplies and castles. Aimery was present at B√©ziers when Agnes, widow of the last viscount, Raymond Roger Trencavel, handed the viscounty of B√©ziers over to Simon de Montfort IV. The next year (1210), Aimery assisted Simon in the siege of Minerve, but he refused, on account of the wishes of his subjects, to participate in the siege of Castelnaudary. Aimery may have taken part in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, where the united armies of Spain, led by Alfonso VIII of Castile, Aimery's homeland, routed the Almohads. It is known that Arnaud Amalric, the Archbishop of Narbonne, took part. Pope Innocent III, organiser of the Albigensian Crusade, had granted the title Duke of Narbonne, which had been held by Aimery's uncle and namesake Aimerico Manrique until 1177, to the archbishop. Arnaud was thus Aimery's suzerain by 1212.S√°nchez de Mora, La nobleza castellana, 345‚Äì46. Modern artist's impression of the Siege of Toulouse, at which Aimery was present. After the Battle of Muret in 1213, Aimery refused entry in Narbonne to Simon de Montfort, who proceeded to besiege the place. Aimery led an effective sally that split the attacking troops and forced them to retreat, lifting the siege. The next year (1214), Aimery was one of those who intervened with Pope Innocent and forced him to order Simon to do homage to King James I of Aragon for his lands in southern France.Among the others who persuade the Pope were Count Sancho of Roussillon, Guillem de Montcada, and Guillem de Cardona. When Simon hesitated to obey, Aimery prepared for war, but the intervention of Cardinal Peter of Benevento, the Papal legate for Provence, prevented open hostilities. A settlement was reached in April 1214 to which Aimery and the citizens of Narbonne were party. In 1215 Louis the Lion, the son of the king of France, Philip Augustus, entered the territory of the duchy of Narbonne with an army. Philip had recognised Simon as Duke of Narbonne and now Louis, acting on his father's behalf, ordered the destruction of Narbonne's walls, to prevent any resistance to the royal will from being exercised later. Later that year the Fourth Council of the Lateran opened. Upon his return from the council in 1216, Arnaud Amalric tried to convince Aimery and the citizens of Narbonne to renounce their submission to Simon, but the duke of Narbonne was at the height of his power and the viscount and citizens renewed their submission and were put under Simon's protection. Restoration of peace In May 1217, Simon de Montfort was forced to besiege Toulouse after it had fallen into the hands of the deposed Count Raymond VI. Aimery participated in the siege and received the Papal letters defending Simon's actions and excoriating James of Aragon for supporting Raymond. After Simon's death during the siege (1218) and five more years of warfare, Raymond submitted and was appointed Duke of Narbonne in 1223. Aimery did him homage for his viscounty.S√°nchez de Mora, La nobleza castellana, 347. Although Aimery's final years were externally peaceful, he had many internal disputes to contend with. He died in February 1239, leaving Narbonne to his eldest son, Amalric I. Aimery's first wife, in 1202, was a Catalan noblewoman, , separated wife of Guillaume Raymond de Montcada and mother of Guillem II de Montcada, viscount of Bearn. They separated before August 1208. Aimery's second marriage was to Marguerite de Marly, a Frenchwoman. All of his five children were borne by her.

He praised the great Persian epics and the ancient Iranian culture and how Ferdowsi summoned all these ancient stories in his masterpiece, Shahnameh. Then Ministerialdirektor Prof. Dr. Theodor Vahlen as the Deputy of Reichserziehungsminister Dr. Bernhard Rust, made an speech. He said that the German Reich is very happy to have the opportunity to show its friendship towards the Imperial Iranian government through holding these ceremonies in honor of Ferdowsi and to show how well the German Reich respects the Iranian culture. He said that, we know the National Socialism is misunderstood by many people, but I want to reaffirm once again that the National Socialist government of Germany has no hostility with the foreign cultures and we deeply respect other cultures as long as they respect our German culture. All children of the oriental countries are welcome in Germany to study in our universities and to learn about German culture. We want them to feel at home while they are studying in our country. He also said that the German and Persian folks have a same root and both are Indo-Germanic people. In the end, he praised and hailed Reza Shah Pahlavi for his efforts toward modernization of Iran. The next lecturer was Prof. Dr. Hans Heinrich Schaeder who made an emotional speech with the title of \\"Ferdowsi and the Germans\\". Finally, Abolghasem Khan Nadjm, the Imperial Iranian ambassador to Berlin, made the final speech and said these ceremonies in Berlin which are held to the honor of the greatest Persian poet, Ferdowsi, shows our common roots with the German people and that we are both Aryan people. He said that the name of Iran means the Land of Aryans. He finished his words with the praise of the works of the F√ºhrer, Adolf Hitler, in Germany.  Ferdowsi and the Germans  Dr. Schaeder in his speechBBC Persian praised Ferdowsi for his tremendous work to revive the Persian language against all odds and the pressure of foreign cultures. He also compared the history of Germany to the struggle of heroes in Shahnameh and concluded that these two are very similar. He called the year 1819 a pivotal juncture in the course of Germans' familiarity with the oriental culture. Along with the publication of new Deutsch translations of Hafiz and Rumi, the renowned German writer Joseph G√∂rres completed his translation of the Shahnameh in this year which received great welcome with the German readers. He said the Shahnameh had a great impact on the German orientalists and inspired many scholars to conduct exploratory researches about Ferdowsi.

It remained in effect until Ronald Reagan ended it in 1981 upon taking the office of president. American farmers felt the brunt of the sanctions, while it had a much lesser effect on the Soviet Union, bringing the validity of such embargoes into question. During the presidential election campaign of 1980, Republican nominee Ronald Reagan promised to end the embargo while incumbent Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter was not willing to do so.Oki, Kazuhisa. U.S. FOOD EXPORT CONTROLS POLICY: THREE CASES FROM 1973 TO 1981. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.  Causes  The Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan was met by the United States with numerous economic sanctions including the grain embargo. In addition, the United States led a boycott of the 1980 Olympics which were hosted in Moscow.  Effect of embargo on the Soviet Union  The effect of the embargo on the Soviet Union was minimal as they were able to receive grain from other sources, with the Soviets receiving more grain from their second highest import partner, Argentina. These sources included most of South America such as Venezuela and Brazil. These crops were cheaper than the American grain, as the labor cost was much cheaper. The Soviet Union still received grain from the United States with regard to the grain agreement in 1975 between the two countries. The agreement said that the United States was required to send 8 million tons of grain to the Soviets.Taylor, Marcia Zarley. \\"Russian Grain Embargo in Retrospect.\\" DTN Progressive Farmer. N.p., 21 Mar. 2014. Web. 18 Oct. 2016. The embargo was a blessing in disguise for the Soviets as they were able to see that they didn‚Äôt need the United States‚Äô grain. Instead, they could cultivate their own in Ukraine and import the grain from South America. Even after the embargo was lifted the Soviets still relied on the grain from Ukraine and South America and reduced their interaction with the U.S.Luttrell, Clifton B.

Web. 18 Oct. 2016.  Key figures of the 1980 grain embargo  The main figure of the 1980 grain embargo was Jimmy Carter. The grain embargo was his way of using food as a weapon. Carter believed that if he could cut out the Soviets grain imports, then they wouldn't be able to feed their livestock or people, hoping that the people in the country would lead to unrest against the war in Afghanistan.Luttrell, Clifton B. The Russian Grain Embargo: Dubious Success. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print. Another key figure in the grain embargo was the Farm Bureau. At first, they supported the embargo as they saw it as a way for farmers to sell more of their grain to Americans. As a result, grain prices dropped and farmers became angered with the legislation and decided to protest against the embargo. When Jimmy Carter lost their support it was the end for the embargo.Taylor, Marcia Zarley. \\"Russian Grain Embargo in Retrospect.\\" DTN Progressive Farmer. N.p., 21 Mar. 2014. Web. 18 Oct. 2016. A year later, Ronald Reagan took power with the support of the Farm Bureau and ended the embargo. Another key figure of the 1980 Grain Embargo was the farm strike movement. The farm strike movement was a group of farmers who protested the embargo through peaceful means such as the incidents with encircling the USDA headquarters in few states with their tractors. Their actions brought attention to the demands of the farmers for the embargo to be lifted.Paarlberg, Robert L. \\"\\"Lessons of the Grain Embargo\\"\\" N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Oct. 2016.

In a 37-13 loss on August 12 to the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Davis scored the only touchdown for BC on a 51-yard rush, had 84 rushing yards on three carries overall, and returned five kickoffs for 133 yards. Because of this, Mike Beamish of The Vancouver Sun wrote that Davis \\"could be the Lions' most exciting runner/returner since Stefan Logan.\\" On September 25, Davis returned punts for 244 yards in a 29-10 victory over the Calgary Stampeders, and the CFL named Davis special teams player of the week.

It formed part of No. 10 Operational Group (later the Australian First Tactical Air Force) at its establishment in November 1943, when it comprised three squadrons equipped with Vultee Vengeance dive bombers. No. 77 Wing commenced operations in early 1944, flying out of Nadzab, Papua New Guinea. Soon afterwards, however, the Vengeance units were withdrawn from combat and replaced with squadrons flying Douglas Bostons, Bristol Beaufighters and Bristol Beauforts. The wing saw action in the assaults on Noemfoor, Tarakan, and North Borneo, by which time it was an all-Beaufighter formation made up of Nos. 22, 30 and 31 Squadrons. It was to have taken part in the Battle of Balikpapan in June 1945, but unsuitable landing grounds meant that the Beaufighter units were withdrawn to Morotai, sitting out the remainder of the war before returning to Australia, where they disbanded, along with the wing headquarters, in 1946.

In the end they had an unhappy marriage and he later became dissatisfied with her.Mayor, The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome‚Äôs deadliest enemy p.218 Monime later repented her marriage to Mithridates VI, her elevation, and leaving her native city. In 72/71 BC, when her husband was compelled to abandon his dominions and took refuge in the Kingdom of Armenia, Monime was put to death at Pharnacia. Her correspondence to Mithridates VI, which was of a licentious character, fell into the hands of Roman General Pompey at the capture of the fortress at Caenon Phrourion. In fiction Monime is a character in a tragedy of five acts called Mithridate. The actresses Marie Champmesl√© and Rachel have played the part of Monime. She is also a character in Steven Saylor's novel Wrath of the Furies. She is characterized as an albino in Colleen McCollough‚Äôs novel The Grass Crown.

Historic North Topeka William Curtis (grandfather of Charles Curtis, who was born in North Topeka and went on to become Vice President of the United States under Hoover) and Louis Laurent laid out a town in 1865 that they called Eugene (possibly after a place in Indiana). Less than a year later, on New Year's Day, what is now North Topeka welcomed the first train (Union Pacific) to town. The advent of the railroad assured that this area would for much of the 19th century be the industrial heart of the Kansas capital (excluding the mammoth AT&SF; shops across the river). In April 1867, southside Topeka annexed Eugene, the first such city expansion. At the time more evenly matched in population and economy, north and south played a tug- of-war for industry and commerce during the remainder of the 1800s. In 1903, North Topeka suffered the devastating effects of a major flood. However, many fine buildings dating from that period remain, and, when restored, will make North Topeka a showplace of Victorian-era commercial and residential architecture.

This receptor is composed of two proteins, amnionless (AMN), and cubilin. A defect in either of these protein components can cause this syndrome. This is a rare disease, with a prevalence about 1 in 200,000, and is usually seen in patients of European ancestry. Vitamin B12 is an important vitamin needed for proper functioning of the bone marrow; if deficient, this may lead to decreased marrow output and anemia. Vitamin B12 has two forms, one of which, along with folate, is important in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is sensitive to acid deformation in the stomach, so a molecule called haptocorrin (R-factor), protects it in the stomach. In the small intestine, a molecule named intrinsic factor (IF), allows vitamin B12 to be absorbed in the ileum. IGS is caused by a mutation in the receptors located in the terminal portion of ileum. This is a very rare, and unlikely cause of vitamin B12 deficiency but is a cause nonetheless. Signs and symptoms Defined as those seen in any macrocytic, megaloblastic anemia: *Anemia: causing fatigue, conjuctival pallor, pale complexion, and in some cases, a mild icterus (yellowing of the eye). *Glossitis (\\"shiny tongue\\"): shiny, glossy tongue. *Cheilosis (stomatitis): Inflammation of the edges of the lips and the oral mucosa. *Tabes dorsalis (\\"subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord\\"): This involves the posterior section of the spinal cord and therefore involves proprioception (sense of position), touch, sense of vibration and in severe cases the lateral corticospinal tract, causing spastic paralysis of the limbs. * Peripheral neuropathy: tingling sensation in the arms and legs. * Pancytopenia: decreased number of blood cells of all lineages (RBCs, leucocytes, platelets), due to decreased bone marrow production. * Methylmalonyl CoA-emia: defined as blood having an unusually high concentration of methylmalonyl CoA. * Peripheral findings such as hypersegmented neutrophils and large RBCs on high field view of the blood smears. * Laboratory findings indicating increased MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume), decreased Hgb/Hct (indicating anemia), and decreased value of vitamin B12 in the blood. * Proteinuria: protein found in the urine detected by analysis or by dipstick. * Reversal of all symptoms except neurological symptoms, by IV injection of vitamin B12. * Schilling test indicating _no_ radioactive vitamin B12 in the urine. (This test has dropped out of favor and should not be tried in patients with any form of renal failure). Genetics The disease is autosomal recessive, and can therefore skip generations. Mutations in either amnionless (AMN) or cubilin can be the culprit. Due to its autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, affected individuals (persons possessing a homozygous recessive genotype) need to undergo genetic counselling to identify risk of family members who might be heterozygous genetic carriers. Certain mutations on the CUBN or AMN (genes that encode cubilin and amnionless respectively) have been identified through genetic analysis, and ethnic susceptibility of some of the mutations were indicated from the current research.Tanner, S. M., Sturm, A., Baack, E. C., Liyanarachchi, S., & De La Chapella, A. (2012). Inherited cobalamin malabsorption. Mutations in three genes reveal functional and ethnic patterns.

Genetically Heterogeneous Selective Intestinal Malabsorption of Vitamin B12: Founder Effects, Consanguinity, and High Clinical Awareness Explain Aggregations in Scandinavia and the Middle Ease. Human Mutation, 23, 327-333. It has been further suggested that mutations on CUBN were restricted to exon 1-28 which encoded amnionless binding domains (EGF) and IF-Cbl binding region of cubilin, while AMN mutations primarily clustered in intron 8-11 and transmembrane domain in exon 10. Some interesting aspects of particular mutations were also elucidated by the researchers, for example, CUBN mutation c.3890C>T; p.Pro1297Leu, was considered to be a Finnish founder mutation presenting mostly in homozygous status, while an AMN mutation c.208-2A>G, which was thought to account for 15% IGS cases around the world, was postulated as an ancient founder mutation that can trace back to approximately 13,600 years ago.Beech, C.

Pathogenesis Vitamin B12, is an essential water-soluble vitamin found in animal products (such as liver, meat, fish, and dairy products). Vitamin B12 is not found in plant sources; a vegetarian diet can be a risk factor for vitamin B12 deficiency. Normal daily intake of vitamin B12 is 7‚Äì30 micro gram, cooking has minimal effect on the structure of this vitamin. The minimal daily adult requirement is 1‚Äì3 micro gram, and the human body is able to store at any one time about 2‚Äì3 milligram, which is sufficient for at least 2 years of impeccable functioning before the source is depleted. In terms of absorption, no more than 2‚Äì3 microgram of vitamin B12 can be absorbed on a daily basis, with some 5‚Äì10 microgram of the vitamin B12 involved in enterohepatic circulation. This is in general a principal characteristic of water-soluble vitamins, in that no matter the oral intake, there is a certain threshold for intestinal absorption hence, low or non-existent chance of intoxication, as opposed to fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin B12 has a major function in the nuclear replication of the DNA. It is therefore logical that its deficiency causes decrease bone marrow production, one of the most common manifestations of which is decreased red blood cell production or as it is referred to medically, anemia. Vitamin B12 however has two major forms in the human body: *Deoxyadenosyl B12 or as it is sometimes referred to Ado B12: Ado B12 is essential for acid-base maintenance of the blood, simply because Ado B12 is the catalyst that assists the conversion of methylmalonyl CoA into succinyl CoA. In absence of vitamin B12, levels of methylmalonyl CoA increase, and this is in fact a great way to distinguish folate deficiency macrocytic anemia, from vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. The following is the reaction in which Ado B12, plays a pivotal role: Propionyl CoA ‚Üí Methylmalonyl CoA ‚Üí Succinyl CoA *Methyl B12: This form of vitamin B12 is essential for conversion of Methy-THF (methyl tetrahydrofolate) into THF, and methyl (CH3). The methyl group, is then used to add a carbon, to homocysteine, converting it into methionine. Methionine is further converted to S-adenosyl methionine, which in turn gives of the extra carbon it received from THF, now to a DNA nucleotide, becoming S-adenosyl homcysteine. S-adenosyl Homocysteine, further loses its \\"S-adenosyl\\" attachment, to become homocysteine, and the cycle repeats yet again! Methyl THF ‚Üí CH3 \\\\+ THF ‚Üì Homocysteine ‚Üí Methionine S-adenosyl ‚Üê ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üê S-adenosyl S-adenosyl Homocysteine ‚Üê S-adenosyl Methionine ‚Üì CH3 ‚Üì DNA ‚Üí Methyl-DNA It is therefore understood that vitamin B12 is involved in complex DNA synthesis, along with folate, as well as in acid-base metabolism. To understand the basic pathophysiology of Imerslund‚ÄìGr√§sbeck syndrome, it is imperative to understand the absorption of vitamin B12. The following lists principal events that lead to absorption of vitamin B12 along the GI tract: * Oral cavity: vitamin B12 containing food is ingested. Salivary glands produce haptocorrin, which binds vitamin B12, creating a \\"vitamin B12-Haptocorrin complex\\". This complex is then ingested via esophageal peristalsis into the stomach. * Stomach: vitamin B12-Haptocorrin, survives the low pH, highly osmotic environment of the stomach. Parietal cells produce hydrochloric acid (the effect of which Haptocorrin protects vitamin B12 from), and also intrinsic factor (IF). Intrinsic factor also has a high binding affinity for vitamin B12, but because that position is already filled by Haptocorrin, free intrinsic factor, and \\"Haptocorrin-vitamin B12\\" complex, empty from the stomach into the duodenum. * duodenum: Pancreatic juice, produced by the pancreas, contains pancreatic proteases that break the haptocorrin, degrading it and freeing the vitamin B12. Once free, vitamin B12, binds with intrinsic factor (IF), to produce an \\"IF-vitamin B12\\" complex. * Ileum: Cubam, a receptor found in the terminal portion of the ileum is a specialized receptor complex. The complex is responsible for the recognition of the \\"vitamin B12-IF\\" complex and initiating the endocytosis of the complex, resulting in absorption. Cubam is composed of two molecules, amnionless (AMN) and cubilin. Cubilin is a multi-ligand protein that contains eight epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats and 27 CUB domains, from which the four active domains (CUB5-8) collectively get involved in binding interaction with the IF-Cbl complex. Mathews, F. S., Gordon, M. M., Chen, Z., Rajashankar, K. R., Ealick, S. E., Alpers, D. H., & Sukumar, N. (2007). Crystal structure of human intrinsic factor: Cobalamin complex at 2.6-A resolution. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 104(44), 17311-17316. Whereas, amnionless is an apical transmembrane protein which is expressed in both intestine and kidney, and it seems to assist the subcellular localization and endocytosis of the cubilin by binding to its amino-terminal residues.Fyfe, J., Madsen, M., Hojrup, P., Christensen, E. I., Tanner, S. M., De La Chapelle, M., He, Q., & Moestrup, S. K. (2004). The functional cobalamin (vitamin B12)‚Äìintrinsic factor receptor is a novel complex of cubilin and amnionless. Blood, 103(5), 1573-1579.Grasbeck, R. (2006). Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome (selective vitamin B12 malabsorption with proteinuria). Orphanet Journal of Rare diseases, 1(1), 17. Cubilin specializes in recognition of the \\"vitamin B12-IF\\" complex and attaches to it, while amnionless (AMN) is responsible for initiation of the endocytosis of complex and the subsequent absorption of vitamin B12. It is at this point that the pathology of IGS syndrome occurs by preventing the absorption of vitamin B12, and can be caused by a mutation in either the amnionless (AMN) portion or the cubilin portion of the receptor. Diagnosis Treatment Since the essential pathology is due to the inability to absorb vitamin B12 from the bowels, the solution is therefore injection of IV vitamin B12. Timing is essential, as some of the side effects of vitamin B12 deficiency are reversible (such as red blood cell (RBC) indices, peripheral RBC smear findings such as hypersegmented neutrophils, or even high levels of methylmalonyl CoA), but some side effects are irreversible as they are of a neurological source (such as tabes dorsalis, and peripheral neuropathy). High suspicion should be exercised when a neonate, or a pediatric patient presents with anemia, protein in the urine, sufficient vitamin B12 dietary intake, and no signs of pernicious anemia. Epidemiology This is a rare disease with prevalence about 1 in 200,000 to 1 in 600,000. Studies showed that mutations in CUBN or AMN clustered particularly in the Scandinavian countries and the Eastern Mediterranean regions. Founder effect, higher clinical awareness to IGS, and frequent consanguineous marriages all play a role in the higher prevalence of IGS among these populations. History The syndrome is the result of the collective work done by a Norwegian pediatrician, Olga Imerslund,\\"Who named it --Olga Imerslund\\" a Finnish physician and clinical biochemist, Armas Ralph Gustaf Gr√§sbeck, and Emil Najman, a pediatrician from Croatia.

Turner took a prominent part in the Appomattox Campaign and early in Congressional Reconstruction was responsible for forces occupying the Department of Virginia. After his retirement from the Army as head of the depot and commissary in St. Louis, Missouri, Turner remained in the city and became a leading citizen and public works commissioner.U.S. Civil War Soldier Records and Profiles, 1861-1865 available on ancestry.com although link to American Civil War General Officers down on January 7, 2018 Early life Turner was born in New York in 1833 and was appointed to West Point at age 18. He graduated in 1855. He was assigned to the 1st U.S. Artillery and fought in the Third Seminole War. Civil War =Early service= When the Civil War began, Turner was 1st lieutenant and was quickly promoted to captain. He served on the staff of David Hunter first in Kansas then in the Department of the South where he rendered valuable services at the battle of Fort Pulaski. =Charleston= On June 13, 1863 Turner was appointed chief of staff in the Department of the South under Quincy A. Gillmore. He participated in the operations against Charleston, South Carolina in 1863. On September 6, 1863 Turner was awarded a brevet promotion to Major, U.S. Army for his service at Battery Wagner. The following day he was appointed brigadier general of U.S. Volunteers.Eicher p.538 =Petersburg= In May 1864 Gillmore's X Corps was transferred to the Petersburg front and Turner continued as chief of staff through the Bermuda Hundred Campaign. On June 22, 1864 he received his first infantry command of the war at the head of the 2nd Division, X Corps. Turner and his division participated in the Siege of Petersburg, primarily north of the James River. Although held in reserve at the battle of the Crater, Turner was nonetheless given a brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel, U.S. Army. During the Winter of 1864/1865 he served as chief of staff to the Army of the James. =Fort Gregg and Appomattox= The defeat of Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley freed up available units in Philip H. Sheridan's Army of the Shenandoah to be sent to the Petersburg front. In March, Turner assumed command of the so-called Independent DivisionOfficial Records of reinforcements from the recently victorious Army of the Shenandoah. Despite its name, Turner's Independent Division was attached to the newly created XXIV Corps under John Gibbon. At the end of the Petersburg Campaign, Gibbon's corps was assigned the task of assaulting Forts Gregg and Whitworth. Turner's division was split between the two forts, sending one brigade against the lesser Fort Whitworth, while the other two joined Robert S. Foster in the main thrust against Fort Gregg.Epperson, James F., With the fall of Petersburg, Turner participated in the forced march to Appomattox Courthouse, where he and other troops of the Army of the James directly intercepted Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia. Turner was given a brevet promotions to colonel, brigadier general and major general in the U.S. Army for services at Petersburg. Later and personal life Turner remained in command of the XXIV Corps, as brevet Major General of Volunteers responsible for overseeing occupied Virginia when he was mustered out of the volunteer service on September 1, 1866. He commanded the District of Henrico, Virginia (including Richmond, the former Confederate capital city) from June 9, 1865 until April 6, 1866, and the entire Department of Virginia from April 7 until May 17. Part of his responsibility in Virginia was re-establishing the local government and persuading it to take responsibility for law enforcement as well as support of unemployed persons (both former soldiers and former slaves). This proved especially problematic, as Richmond's long-time mayor, Joseph C. Mayo used vagrancy laws against black persons, and the vast majority of those fed by soup kitchens were African Americans. Thus, Turner ordered his men not to follow Mayo's orders until Governor Francis Pierpont replaced him with city council president David J. Saunders, who was also appointed head of the city- run gasworks and waterworks.Michael B. Chesson, Richmond After the War: 1865-1890 (Virginia State Library, 1981) pp. 92-93W.

The Mutt follows the Thenkalai tradition of Sri Vaishnava culture. The Mutt has Manavala Mamunigal as the torch bearer of the tradition of Vishistadvaita and Emberumanar Darsanam, which is known to be the way as propagated by sants Ramanuja. The Mutt houses seers who have the title of Sri Satagopa Ramanuja Jeeyar. The present pontiff of the Mutt is the 23rd Peetam Paramahamsethyathi Sri Sri Sri Satagopa Ramanuja Jeeyar Swami. The Mutt has an unbroken lineage from its founder Manavala Mamunigal. History Sri Manavala Mamunigal visited Srivilliputtur, the birthplace of Andal and Sri Periyalwar the greatest Vaishnavaitic Sants during the Pandya Kingdom period. Legends say that Sri Mamunigal (seer of Sri Rangam) attended the darshan of Thayar Sri Andal during her most celebrated Maargali Ennaikaapu Festival. This festival is celebrated annually in December‚ÄìJanuary. Sri Andal appeared in the dreams of the Archakas (temple priests) and Athyapakas (people of the town) and extended the festival for one more day so that Sri Manavala Mamunigal would have a chance to attend. As per the orders of the presiding deity of the temple Sri Andal, arrangements were made for Sri Manavala Mamunigal to witness the festival for one more day. Sri Andal appeared before Sri Mamunigal and asked him whether he had any other grievances. After observing Sri Andal from her crown to lotus feet he said that she looked very graceful and offered her a kunjam (ornament used to decorate women's hair plaits). Legends say that the kunjam was offered by Tamil poet Kamban when he visited Srivilliputtur. Hence, the kunjam is known as ‚ÄòKamban Kunjam‚Äô. On Maharasankarathi day (first day of Tamil month ‚ÄòThai‚Äô, usually 14 or 15 January) Sri Andal blesses for the sake of Sri Manavala Mamunigal and after taking a bath in the temple pond ‚ÄòThirumukkulam ‚Äì Sri Sudharsana Chakkra Theertham‚Äô. She arrived at the entrance of this Mutt and Manavala Mamunigal processional deity brought near her to observe her maternal divine beauty. Tradition This Mutt is an independent mutt and is the only mutt established by Sri Manavala Mamunigal on the request of Srivilliputtur people to give them discourses on philosophical values and Sri Vaishnava tradition. To continue this divine duty, Sri Manavala Mamunigal established the aacharya peetam and appointed seers to succeed him. This mutt holds a continuous history with the Seers known as Jeeyars for 600 years. Despite interruptions due to invasions, the mutt holds records of grants given by various rulers such as the King of Mysore. The 23rd peetam is Sri Sri Sri Satakopa Ramanuja. Jeeyar Swamy was the pontiff of this mutt . Sri Thiruvalmarbhan The divinity deemed to be in the mutt is Sri Thiruvalmarbhan (\\"The Lord Who has His chest as a divine residence of His Consort Sri Lakshmi Devi known as Thayar\\"). Sri Thiruvalmarbhan in this mutt holds a special history. The Lord was among the 'Pancha Berars' (the important five forms of Lord residing in every temple that follows an aagama way of worship) of the Divya Desam of Thiruvalla. A magician stole the idol and was travelling towards his home via the foot hills of Western Ghats. The magician hid the idol in a cave. The Lord appeared in Manavala Mamunigal's dreams and ordered him to fetch the idol from the cave. The idol is seated at the immediate left of Manavala Mamunigal's processional deity.

By 1646, he had married Genevi√®ve-√âlizabeth Bonneau; the ceremony was held at La Perri√®re; his uncle presided. Despite burning his uncle's theological writings, Du Chastelet became a fervent Catholic; he believed that the Huguenots needed to be expelled from France, and his work frequently invoked God, and implored rulers to fight for a good cause and spare non-combatants; in his most famous work, he claimed to have learnt from battles he was involved in, which has been speculated to refer to the Fronde. His date of death is unknown, with some claiming that he died as early as 1670, only a short while after the 1668 publication of his Traite de guerre, ou Politique militaire, but a more plausible estimate of his death is 1682. The Traite de guerre is notable for distinguishing between offensive and defensive warfare and for being compiled for Louis XIV of France. He is considered to be one of only two major strategists in Europe in the middle of the 17th century; the other being Raimondo Montecuccoli.

Porter. Produced by the Edison Manufacturing Company, it is the earliest known political satire in American film. It features three actors, all of whom are unknown. Plot Lasting just 61 seconds and consisting of two shots, the first shot is set in a wood during winter. The actor representing then vice-president Theodore Roosevelt enthusiastically hurries down a hillside towards a tree in the foreground. He falls once, but rights himself and cocks his rifle. Two other men, bearing signs reading \\"His Photographer\\" and \\"His Press Agent\\" respectively, follow him into the shot; the photographer sets up his camera. \\"Teddy\\" aims his rifle upward at the tree and fells what appears to be a common house cat, which he then proceeds to stab. \\"Teddy\\" holds his prize aloft, and the press agent takes notes. The second shot is taken in a slightly different part of the wood, on a path. \\"Teddy\\" rides the path on his horse towards the camera and out to the left of the shot, followed closely by the press agent and photographer, still dutifully holding their signs. Background Terrible Teddy, the Grizzly King was inspired by political cartoons that originally ran in William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal. These cartoons depicted Roosevelt as a macho hunting enthusiast with a strong taste for publicity, killing a mountain lion in Colorado while the press took in the event. The film is based on 1901 New York Journal comics panels that ran on February 4 (first shot) and 18th (second shot) very closely.Musser, Charles (1991), Before the Nickelodeon - Edwin S.

It was first named by paleontologists Rainer R. Schoch, Sebastian Voigt and Michael Buchwitz in 2010 from a nearly complete skull and associated osteoderms. The type species is M. pustulatus. Description Madygenerpeton, like other chroniosuchids, has osteoderms, or bony plates, overlying its spine. These osteoderms interlock with each other and connect to their associated vertebrae on the spinal column. They are wide and have curved or peaked surfaces. On the upper surface of the front end and the lower surface of the back end of each osteoderm there are facets covered in concentric ridges and furrows. These facets allow the plates to interlock with each other. The relatively narrow width of the osteoderms in Madygenerpeton allow for more lateral flexion in the trunk of than other chroniosuchids, up to 7.5¬∞. The skull has a parabolic outline and its surface is covered with pustular ornamentation. This distinctive ornamentation gives the type species its name, M. pustulatus. Unlike other chroniosuchids, Madygenerpeton lacks an antorbital fontanelle in front of the eyes.The postparietal or posterior area of the skull is concave.  Paleobiology  The tightly interlocking osteoderms along the back of Permian chroniosuchians were likely an adaptation to terrestrial locomotion. The plates made the vertebral column more rigid, allowing it to better cope with stresses from shearing, torsion, compression, and tension. However, the increased stability of the vertebral column resulted in less flexibility. In Madygenerpeton, the increased flexibility of the trunk may have been an adaptation to a secondarily aquatic lifestyle. Greater lateral flexion would have enabled lateral undulation useful for swimming.

Later, they both taught at the Prussian General War School, which would become the Prussian War Academy, and R√ºhle became Clausewitz' second successor as its director. R√ºhle published many articles, kept official war diaries, and wrote a two-volume Manual for the Officer for Education in Peace and for Use in Action (Handbuch f√ºr den Offizier zur Belehrung im Frieden und zum Gebrauch im Felde), published in Berlin in 1817 and 1818. Lilienstern and Clausewitz, teaching at the same school at the time of publication of this manual, were in agreement on many points. For example, they agreed that war was political in nature (which was neither a novel nor a controversial idea) and that war was a Zweikampf. (That is, literally a \\"two-struggle,\\" usually translated into English as \\"duel,\\" though in fact the imagery and metaphor that Clausewitz pursued was a wrestling match.) Clausewitz made these ideas famous in his book On War. Their common views on such issues can be traced to the nature of the military intellectual community in Prussia and the common influence of Scharnhorst. Lilienstern was a close friend of the landscape painter Caspar David Friedrich and his writing contributed to modern research of the artist.

The biweekly paper is published on every-other Thursday, and is a member of the College Publisher Network.College Publisher Network Affiliates. College Publisher Network. Retrieved on November 11, 2010. History Pacific University started a campus newspaper in 1893 as a monthly paper named the Pacific University Index. By 1899, circulation for the 16-page paper had grown to 275, with a subscription costing 50 cents. The paper experimented with a \\"date bureau\\" to help students find dates, starting the program in March 1936. In 1939, The Index was selected for a second-class honor rating by the Associated Collegiate Press. Then, for the 1939 to 1940 academic year, The Index went through three editors, with freshman Don Wilson as the third taking over in January 1940. In 1943, the paper was awarded a first-class honor rating by the Associated Collegiate Press. For the 1951 to 1952 school year, Bill Hilliard was the elected editor of the paper, which was still a weekly publication at that time. In 1965, the newspaper and school yearbook were both put under the direction of the school‚Äôs journalism department, the first time that had happened at Pacific. That year, Patricia Stephenson was selected as the editor. The Index endorsed then U.S. Representative Robert B. Duncan over then-governor Mark Hatfield in the 1966 U.S. Senate Race, which Hatfield went on to win. The newspaper also endorsed Tom McCall for Oregon Secretary of State, and Pacific University later started an annual lecture series named in McCall‚Äôs honor. In October 2010, the Index went through a redesign as well as improvements to the associated website. The newspaper was a biweekly publication at that time. Details The student newspaper is published biweekly on Thursdays, though stories appear online more frequently. The Index is distributed only on the college‚Äôs main campus in Forest Grove and at the school‚Äôs Health Professions Campus in Hillsboro, Oregon. The current editor in-chief of the newspaper is Hannah Kendall.
