The following year an accessibility bus with a manual ramp was used in Toronto. He designed and managed the Walter Callow Wheelchair Bus, while he himself was blind, quadriplegic and, eventually had both legs amputated. Callow planned trips for disabled veterans, tours of the countryside, picnics, sporting events, art classes and other activities. He was born in Parrsboro, Nova Scotia and became a resident of the Camp Hill Military Hospital for twenty years.  Biography  Walter Callow Wheel Chair Bus (2013), Halifax, Nova Scotia As a member of the Royal Flying Corps in Camp Mohawk, Ontario, Callow crashed in a test flight in 1918. He received a serious back injury and a heart condition. He continued on in a lumber business in Advocate, Nova Scotia. He eventually became bed-ridden in 1931 because of his injuries, the same year his mother and wife died and left him with a young child. He continued business by selling real-estate. In 1937 Callow became a full-time resident of the Camp Hill Hospital and two years later he was blind and quadriplegic. While at the Hospital he established a board of directors and hired two secretaries. He established the Callow Cigarette Fund to send cigarettes to soldiers serving over-seas during World War II. After the war, he turned his cigarette fund into a wheelchair coach service for disabled veterans (1947).Carman Miller. The 1940s: War and Rehabilitation. in The Atlantic Provinces in Confederation. University of Toronto. 1993. p. 307 He started by having two custom-made buses built in Pubnico, Nova Scotia. He eventually garnered the support of General Motors and Ford to build the wheelchair coaches. He named the company the \\"Callow Veterans' and Invalids' Welfare League\\" and established an office in Halifax. He worked tirelessly to make facilities accessible and to make visible the needs of those with physical disabilities. His funeral was conducted in Halifax with full military honours. The only time that Callow had the opportunity to ride on his bus is when his body was returned to Advocate to be buried.

Later members included Ed Bates on guitar and Peter Martin on slide guitar. The group only existed for 18 months, however according to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they \\"virtually defined a scene that encompassed a new musical aesthetic ... [they] sang about truck drivers, roadhouses and endless highways\\" and although American-influenced they \\"presented a fiercely Australian outlook\\". They disbanded by late 1975 leaving behind a six-track extended play, The Pelaco Bros., which appeared the following year. Camilleri formed a blues and rock music band, Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons; while Cummings and Bates formed a new wave group, the Sports in 1976. On 13 September 2012 Peter Lillie died of liver disease, aged 61.

The group were named for the Pelaco Sign which advertised a local shirt manufacturer. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they played \\"rockabilly, country swing and R&B; that recalled American outfits like Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen and Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks. Yet, the band's delivery presented a fiercely Australian outlook\\". Only existing for 18 months, they later included Ed Bates on guitar and Peter Martin on slide guitar. Their posthumous releases were The Notorious Pelaco Brothers Show a live six-track extended play – also seen as The Pelaco Bros. – on the Ralph imprint in 1976 and three studio tracks for the various artists release, The Autodrifters and The Relaxed Mechanics Meet The Fabulous Nudes and The Pelaco Bros, in June 1978 on Missing Link Records. The Pelaco Brothers had disbanded in late 1975, Camilleri went on to form a blues and rock music band, Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons; Meanwhile, Cummings and Bates formed a new wave group, the Sports in 1976. Lillie formed Relaxed Mechanics with Iain Colquhoun on bass guitar, John Lloyd on drums, Nick Rischbieth on guitar (ex-Sharks) and Dave Steel on vocals. Topper founded The Fabulous Nudes, a country and western group, with Pierre Jaquinot on guitar and vocals (ex-Spo-Dee-O-Dee); Jimmy Jessop on vocals and harmonica (Spo-Dee-O-Dee), Warwick Kennington on drums (Uncle Bob's Band); and Peter Morrison on guitar and harmonica. Soon after both groups disbanded, Lillie and Topper created The Autodrifters and they were soon joined by Warren Rough on guitar and former bandmate, Wolfe on drums. By May 1978 Rick Dempster on vocals and harmonica became a member of The Autodrifters. According to McFarlane, Lillie \\"remained a cult figure on the Melbourne music scene for many years\\". In 1982 the Pelaco Brothers' music was used for a suburban horror film, This Woman Is Not a Car. Lillie's solo album, Poetry & Western, was issued in early 1997.

Known since the early 15th century, the family received a confirmation of nobility from the Holy Roman Emperor in 1563. It was continuously represented in the governing bodies of the city-republic of Basel for centuries, and three members served as Burgomasters, i.e. heads of state, namely Remigius Faesch (1541–1610), Johann Rudolf Faesch (1572–1659) and Johann Rudolf Faesch (1680–1762). The family was at times the richest family of Basel, and its rise was partially the result of clever marriage policies. In the 18th century, the naval officer Franz Fesch (1711–1775) entered the service of the Republic of Genoa and established a branch in Corsica. Its most famous member, Cardinal Joseph Fesch (1763–1839), was the uncle of Napoleon Bonaparte and was a member of the French imperial family during his nephew's rule. He became a French senator and a count in 1805, was elevated to sovereign princely rank in 1806, and was granted the title of a Prince of France in 1807, a dignity held only by himself, Napoleon's siblings, Joachim Murat and Eugène de Beauharnais. He was a member of the Imperial House and in the order of succession to the French imperial throne in accordance with the French constitution of 1804 (Title III, Article 9, \\"The Imperial Family\\"). He was also made a Peer of France in 1815, and subsequently given the title of (Roman) Prince by the Pope. The Fesch Palace in Ajaccio today houses the Musée Fesch, one of France's finest collections of old masters and one of the most important Napoleonic collections. An art museum in Basel also named the Museum Faesch and established by Regimus Faesch in the 17th century is now part of the Basel Historical Museum. Family members have lived in Switzerland, Corsica, Italy, France and Belgium. Many family members have been notable as jurists, bankers or military officers. Isaac Faesch (1687–1758) was governor of the Dutch Antilles 1740–1758. History Goldsmith Hans Rudolf Faesch (1510–1564) and his family, painted in 1559 by Hans Hug Kluber (Kunstmuseum Basel). He received a confirmation of nobility from Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor in 1563. The family is said to be of ancient nobility from Valais in Switzerland.Zeitung für den deutschen Adel, Vol. 1, p. 414, Helbig, 1840 Two brothers of the family acquired the hereditary burghership of Basel in 1409. Family members became members of the council, and thus the ruling class of the city-republic of Basel, from 1494. Members of the family served continuously in the government of the city from the mid 16th century until the end of the 18th century. Several family members also became Burgomaster's and thus heads of the republic, and others became Rectors of the University of Basel. The family intermarried for centuries with other prominent patrician families. Remigius Faesch (ca. 1460–1533) was a famous architect. The Fesch Palace in Ajaccio, today the Musée Fesch Cardinal Joseph Fesch, Prince of France Johann Rudolf Faesch (1680–1762), Burgomaster of Basel Johann Rudolf Faesch (1680–1762), Burgomaster of Basel Anna Catharina Faesch (1671–1719), wife of Johann Rudolf Huber, painted by her husband Three siblings of the Faesch family in Basel in 1849 The goldsmith and member of the city council Hans Rudolf Faesch (1510–1564) was ennobled by Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor in 1563 and received a confirmation of the family arms that added two stars to their crest. Thus the family held a dual status as patricians or members of the Daig of the burgher republic of Basel, and as nobles of the Holy Roman Empire. As of 1659, the Faesch family was the richest family of Basel with a fortune of nearly 250,000 florins. Their family foundation still exists. The jurist, rector of the University of Basel and art collector Remigius Faesch (1595–1667) founded Museum Faesch, an art museum. Its collection became part of the University of Basel in 1823. Several family members entered the service of various European princes. The diplomat Johann Rudolph Faesch (1669–1751) was an adviser to the Margrave of Baden, representative of the Elector of Trier and the Duke of Württemberg at the Court of France. Many family members were also notable as military officers. The family converted to Protestantism in 1530, although the Corsica branch would later return to Catholicism, providing a Cardinal. A branch of the family settled in Geneva in the 19th century, where Alphonse François Faesch became a judge. His son, the engineer Jules Faesch, became a co-owner of the Faesch and Piccard company, and married Amélie de Senarclens de Vuflens, who inherited Vufflens Castle from her father. The family name Faesch or Fesch means roughly \\"chic\\" (as in \\"stylish\\"). =Fesch as part of the imperial family of France= Franz Faesch (born 1711 in Basel, died 1775) became a naval officer (captain) in the service of the Republic of Genoa, posted to Corsica, and married Nobile Angela Maria Pietrasanta (born 1725, died 1790). Their son Joseph Fesch (born 1763 in Ajaccio, died 1839 in Rome) was the half-brother of Letizia Ramolino (a daughter of Angela Maria's first marriage) and through his sister the uncle of Napoleon Bonaparte. He fulfilled the role of protector of the Bonaparte family for some years from 1791. Joseph Fesch became Archbishop of Lyon in 1802, was named a Cardinal in 1803, became French Ambassador to Rome in 1804, became a French senator and count in 1805, became Grand Almoner of France in 1805, obtained the rank of a sovereign prince with the style of Most Eminent Highness as he was chosen as coadjutor of the Prince-Bishopric of Regensburg in 1806, was named a Prince of France (prince français) with the style of Serene Highness in 1807, received the Great Eagle (the highest degree) of the Legion of Honour, was a Knight of the Order of the Golden Spur (1802), a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece (1805), became a Peer of France in 1815 and subsequently a (Roman) Prince (as a noble title in the Papal States). Joseph Fesch was also one of the most famous art collectors of his lifetime. He wed his nephew Napoleon to Joséphine de Beauharnais in Paris in 1804, the day before Napoleon crowned himself as Emperor of the French. Cardinal Fesch lived out his days at the Palazzo Falconieri in Rome, dedicating himself to art and to beneficence.

She represented Thailand in all three editions of the Olympic Games since 1992, and earned numerous medals in her own specialties at the Southeast Asian Games since 1991. While residing in the United States on her college career, she helped the California Golden Bears set a new world record (1:49.23) and capture the 4×50 m medley title at the 2000 NCAA Women's Swimming and Diving Championships. Minpraphal is among the Asian swimmers, along with Joscelin Yeo of Singapore and Akiko Thomson of the Philippines, to train for the Bears under women's head coach Teri McKeever. Career =Early years= Minpraphal made her official worldwide debut, as a 14-year- old, at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. She failed to reach the top 16 final in any of her individual events, finishing forty-second in the 200 m backstroke (2:26.32), thirty-seventh in the 100 m butterfly (1:04.28), twenty- fifth in the 200 m butterfly (2:20.48), thirtieth in the 200 m individual medley (2:23.24), and twenty-eighth in the 400 m individual medley (5:04.95). Shortly after her first Games, Minpraphal accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida, United States, and train for Gregg Troy for the Sharks Swim Club. While swimming for Bolles, she established a school record in the 100-yard backstroke (55.99), and also captured meet titles in the backstroke (both 100 and 200 yards) and individual medley double (both 200 and 400 yards) during her entire high school season. =College career= After graduating from the Bolles School, Minpraphal attended the University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California, where she majored in economics and played for the California Golden Bears women's swimming and diving team, under world-class and head coach Teri McKeever, from 1996 to 2000. During her college career, she posted career bests in the 100-yard butterfly (54.54), 200-yard butterfly (1:58.58), and 400-yard individual medley (4:13.78), and received a total of twelve All-American honors. At the 2000 NCAA Women's Swimming and Diving Championships in Indianapolis, Indiana, during her senior year, Minpraphal shared a 200-yard medley title with Joscelin Yeo, Haley Cope, and Staciana Stitts in a short- course world record of 1:49.23. =International career= Competing for Thailand internationally, Minpraphal broke national records in the backstroke, butterfly, and medley double. When her nation hosted the 1995 Southeast Asian Games in Chiang Mai, she won a total of five medals: four golds each in the 100 m backstroke (1:04.87), 200 m backstroke (2:19.02), 200 m butterfly (2:15.60), and 400 m individual medley (4:54.24); and a silver in the 200 m individual medley (2:19.88). At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Minpraphal built a monstrous program of six swimming events. She placed twenty-first in the 100 m backstroke (1:04.61), thirtieth in the 200 m backstroke (2:21.82), twenty-eighth in the 100 m butterfly (1:03.35), twenty- fifth in the 200 m butterfly (1:03.35), thirty-fourth in the 200 m individual medley (2:22.34), and twenty-seventh in the 400 m individual medley (4:58.33). Three years later, at the 1999 Southeast Asian Games in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, Minpraphal enjoyed the race of her life as she took home two golds in the 100 m butterfly (1:01.16) and in the 200 m butterfly (2:14.54). Minpraphal swam for her third Thai team in the 100 m butterfly at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. After winning two titles from the SEA Games, her entry time of 1:01.16 was officially accredited under a FINA B-standard. She challenged seven other swimmers in heat three, including Ukraine's 17-year-old Mariya Ohurtsova, two-time Olympians Lee Bo-eun of South Korea and Eydis Konráðsdóttir of Iceland. Entering the race with a fastest-seeded time, Minpraphal held off a sprint battle from Ohurtsova to pick up a fifth spot by a hundredth of a second (0.01) in a time of 1:02.99. Minpraphal failed to advance into the semifinals, as she placed thirty-seventh overall on the first day of prelims.

Its first episode went on air on Network Ten on 8 July 2013 at 8:30PM. Wanted was presented and produced from the Network Ten's Sydney studios in Pyrmont. The show was telecast nationally. Because of Australia's multiple time zones, Wanted was aired live on the East Coast. In South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, the show aired on a time delay of 30 minutes and 2 hours respectively. Format Wanted is a criminal investigation show which helps federal and state police directly to solve cold cases, homicides, disappearances and petty theft cases such as burglaries and vandalism. Wanted is a socially interactive show which employs a broad range of social media to encourage the public to help solve crimes, with viewers being encouraged to provide immediate information anonymously that could prove an arrest or a lead to close the case. Presenters Wanted is presented by news presenters Sandra Sully and Matt Doran, and by a team of crime specialists including: *Dr Xanthe Mallett *Neil Mercer *Terry Dalton =Dr Xanthé Mallett= Forensic anthropologist and criminologist Xanthé Mallett investigates cold cases and finds new evidence to the cases. In 2010, Mallett made a series in the UK called History Cold Case for BBC2/National Geographic, with a team from the Centre for Anatomy & Human Identification at the University of Dundee. History Cold Case saw skeletons of everyday people from across the ages analysed in staggering detail, opening new windows on the history of our forebears. A second series was broadcast in June 2011. Mallett also presented a piece about Jack the Ripper called National Treasures for the BBC in 2011. The live magazine-style format show put science at the heart of programming for the BBC's main entertainment channel. =Neil Mercer= Investigative crime reporter Neil Mercer goes into the field and interviews the victims' families for the main feature story. When he isn't available, Doran or Sully presents the story. Mercer has been a journalist for more than 40 years, working in newspapers and television. He has covered crime since 1981 when he reported on the shooting of criminal Warren Lanfranchi by NSW Detective Sergeant Roger Rogerson. =Terry Dalton= Former Detective Superintendent Terry Dalton brings an experience from over 30 years in the field with NSW Police. Dalton mostly presents the Petty Theft cases and brings with it a slight comedic twist to the show. Dalton once said in a case of a string of burglaries on a Sydney University that \\"these crooks are studying how to become a criminal... And they're failing at it\\" because the criminals were in full view of the security cameras. Dalton is a recipient of the National Medal and 1st Clasp to the medal. He is also the recipient of the NSW Police Medal and 3rd Clasp to that medal. He was awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to policing in the community. Dalton was awarded the Australian Police Medal for distinguished service in the 2010 Queen's Birthday Honours List.

Millwood developed after the American Revolutionary War around the Burwell-Morgan Mill (1782-1785; listed in the NRHP since 1969),NRIS No. 021-5009-0001; Va.021-0023 along Spout Run and one of the largest in the area. It is near several roads important in the colonial era, including Route 17 and Route 340. Col. Nathaniel Burwell (1750-1814), who owned over 5,000 acres in the agriculturally productive area constructed it with General Daniel Morgan (1736-1802) as his business partner. The mill had become derelict by the 1940s, when it was acquired by the Clarke County Historical Association, which restored it and operates it as a living history museum. This district includes 10 additional contributing buildings in the village of Millwood. They include a log building (c. 1800) that was originally part of a tannery along Spout Run and later used a tollhouse; a log building (c. 1805) that was used to store liquor and was later converted into a residence; the frame miller's house (c. 1830 located directly south of the mill); a brick store (c. 1836 that partially burned in 1935 and still functions as a store). The remaining buildings are associated with the village's commercial core in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: a 1-story stone and frame outbuilding that may have once been used as a cooper's shop; a frame, 1 ½-story, late-19th century commercial building; a 1 ½-story frame commercial building that once housed the Millwood post office (c. 1900); a 1-story, formed concrete block building (constructed ca. 1928, as a car showroom and now used as an antique shop); and a 1-story, brick former service station (c. 1930) that has housed the post office since 1985.

The premiere, performed by the Sadler's Wells Ballet, took place at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 24 April 1946 in a triple bill; the other works were Ashton's Les Patineurs and Robert Helpmann's Adam Zero. The ballet was conducted by Constant Lambert and the set designed by Sophie Fedorovitch.\\"Les Patineurs – 24 April 1946 Evening 6.45pm\\"; \\"Symphonic Variations – 24 April 1946 Evening 6.45pm\\"; and \\" Adam Zero – 24 April 1946 Evening\\", Collections Online, Royal Opera House, accessed 22 June 2013 Background During the Second World War, Ashton listened to Franck's Symphonic Variations a great deal and he decided to develop an elaborate scenario to be set to the music. Constant Lambert, music director for the Sadler's Wells Ballet,Anderson, p. 6 at first objected to the use of Franck's music for a ballet; Ashton dropped his original scenario and created an abstract ballet. During the war, the repertory had become increasingly literary, and Ashton's purpose was to counteract this.Vaughan, p. 206 It was not his intention to display ingenuity of invention but to construct a more abstract piece, setting three men and three women dancing on the vast expanse of the Opera House stage uncluttered with scenery and effect.Vaughan, p. 207 Description The critic A V Coton described the ballet: Casts Symphonic Variations. Sadler's Wells Ballet in Poznan, 1947 In the opening season the cast was *Margot Fonteyn *Moira Shearer *Pamela May *Michael Somes *Brian Shaw *Henry Danton In the following season Shaw and Danton were replaced by John Hart and Alexander Grant.\\"Symphonic Variations – 1 December 1947 Evening\\" Collections Online, Royal Opera House, accessed 22 June 2013 In the first production and early revivals the work was regarded as making such demands on the dancers that they took no part in any other ballet on the same evening's bill. Margaret Dale in conversation with David Vaughan commented, \\"Even though Symphonic Variations more than any other ballet creates a feeling of serenity, for the dancers, in the beginning it was an 'absolute marathon', and made demands on them that had never been made before. ... It was a test of sheer stamina that very few British dancers could stand at that time.\\"Vaughan, p. 204 Critical reception From the premiere onwards the work has been highly regarded by critics. The Manchester Guardian called the choreography \\"rare, brave and stimulating\\", with the reservation that the prominence of the concertante piano part in the score was not mirrored in a similarly prominent part for the prima ballerina.\\"Ballet at Covent Garden\\", The Manchester Guardian, 26 April 1946, p. 3 The Observer thought the piece \\"charming and exciting\\".\\"Ballet\\", The Observer, 28 April 1946, p. 2 The Times said: Later critics have regarded the work similarly highly. A V Coton of The Daily Telegraph asserted in 1967 that Symphonic Variations \\"remains [Ashton's] absolute and indisputable masterpiece – a perfect fusion of ideas about stylised dance, light, space, romantic-lyric music and heroic costume – which creates a spectacle that calls into question the value of almost every other ballet in the modern repertoire\\".Coton, A V. \\"Ballet\\", The Daily Telegraph, 17 November 1967, p. 10 John Percival of The Times remarked of the same production, \\"Fittingly, the centrepiece of this programme was a revival of Symphonic Variations … as many of us think the best work ever created for this company\\".Percival, John. \\"Matching past glories\\", The Times, 17 November 1967, p. 11 In 2004, Cristina Franchi described it as \\"A pure classical dance work of great beauty and simplicity.\\"Franchi, p. 50 Revivals In November 1967, the Royal Ballet staged a revival of three works by Ashton: Symphonic Variations was part of that triple bill with Les Patineurs and Persephone. The dancers in Symphonic Variations were: * Merle Park * Ann Jenner * Jennifer Penny * Donald MacLeary * Graham Usher * Michael Coleman The work has been toured by the Royal Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet companies, with productions in 1970, with Antoinette Sibley and Anthony Dowell in the cast, and 1992, under the direction of Michael Somes.Vaughan, Davis. \\"1946 Ballets\\" Frederick Ashton and his Ballets, accessed 23 June 2013 Other companies have staged the work, including the Dutch National Ballet (1989); American Ballet Theatre (1992); the National Ballet of Canada (1996); and San Francisco Ballet (2004).This piece has also been performed by the University of North Carolina School of the Arts (2018), being the only school to have ever performed the work.

This could explain why the album, even in its “fun” instrumental moments, comes out sounding so punchy and cynical.

Writing for All About Jazz, Troy Collins stated, \\"An uneven, but engaging record, Your Turn inadvertently suggests rhetorical connotations.

History  William M. Brish had an idea in 1956 to experiment with teaching the K-12 grades using instruction by live television and pre-recorded programs. He was Superintendent of Schools for Washington County, Maryland, at the time. The project was dubbed \\"Pioneering Experiment\\". It was financed by the Electronic Industries Association and the Fund for the Advancement of Education of the Ford Foundation, (the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company was partly involved also in the financing). It was a program costing two million dollars and was spread out over a five-year term (1956–1961). The Ford Foundation Fund along with the Electronic Industries Association contributed some $200,000 a year to the project over the five-year period. These two organizations gave almost $1,500,000 to the Project in the five years it was functional.  Equipment  The television related electronic equipment was provided free of charge by 75 manufacturers through the Electronic Industries Association. This equipment was valued at about $300,000. Initially, in the summer of 1956 a coaxial cable system was set up and connected by Bell Telephone Company. Eight schools in Washington County were the first elementary schools to use the closed-circuit television network in teaching students with instructional television. The initial closed circuit system served about 6,000 pupils from eight elementary schools. All 45 public elementary schools in Washington County were connected to the closed circuit system by September 1963. Junior college students were selected to operate cameras and run the tutorial telecasts. The project required over 125 miles of coaxial cable, which was strung by the Bell Telephone Company with the required associated equipment.  Puppets  The use of puppet shows on television proved to be popular with the elementary school students. The puppets showed health habits, story telling, and Christmas themes.  Awards  The Washington County Closed-Circuit Educational Television Project received the 1958 award of the Thomas Alva Edison Foundation National Mass Media Award for experimenting with educational television in teaching elementary school students.

This production premiered on 28 January 1960, with Nadia Nerina as Lise, David Blair as Colas, Stanley Holden as the Widow Simone, and Alexander Grant as Alain. Since its inception Ashton's staging has become a celebrated classic of the ballet repertory.  Background  Originally Ashton intended to use the 1864 score of Peter Ludwig Hertel, as it had been used for nearly every revival of the ballet since the late 19th century, but after close inspection of this music Ashton decided it would not suit his plans for the revival. At the suggestion of the ballet historian and musicologist Ivor Guest, Ashton studied the 1828 score by Ferdinand Hérold, and found the light, simple music more suitable for his conception. Ashton then commissioned the Royal Opera House's composer and conductor John Lanchbery to orchestrate and edit Hérold's score. After becoming frustrated with the under-developed nature of this music, Ashton and Lanchbery decided that Hérold's music would be better used as a foundation for an entirely new score, for which Lanchbery would compose a few new numbers. They went even further by incorporating passages of the original pastiche music from the premiere of 1789 into the score, as well as one number from Hertel's score which was utilised for the famous Clog Dance. Ashton was disappointed that Hérold's score contained no suitable Grand pas, and for a while considered using the well-known La Fille mal gardée pas de deux. Ivor Guest found a violin reduction of the pas de deux that Fanny Elssler had arranged for her performance in the ballet in 1837, tucked away in an old box of music at the Paris Opéra. This number is now known as The Fanny Elssler pas de deux. Ashton created what is considered to be among his most masterful choreography for his new version of La fille mal gardée. He resurrected the Pas de ruban for Lise and Colas, in which the lovers perform a charming pas with intricate tricks using a pink satin ribbon. Ashton took this idea to an entirely new level with the Fanny Elssler pas de deux, devising a spectacular Grand adage for Lise, Colas and eight women with eight ribbons. Ashton also included Petipa's original mimed sequence known as When I'm Married, a passage that was performed by all of the great ballerinas of old when they danced the role of Lise. He was taught this passage by Tamara Karsavina, former Ballerina of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres and the Original Ballet Russe. She had in turn learned it from her teacher Pavel Gerdt, once the Imperial Ballet's leading male dancer who partnered all of the great ballerinas of the late 19th century and early 20th century in the role of Lise, including Virginia Zucchi. Robert Helpmann was originally cast in the role of Widow Simone, spending considerable time in rehearsal before the pressure of film work in the US compelled him to stand down. To inspire Lanchbery to write music for the Clog Dance, Ashton took the composer to a performance of Lancashire clog dancers. This dance is performed in the ballet by Lise's mother, the Widow Simone. Lanchbery decided to use the leitmotiv for the Widow Simone from Hertel's score, the only music by Hertel that Lanchbery's score contains. Ashton fashioned a humorous number from this music for Simone and four ballerinas, at the beginning of which Lise tempts her mother with a pair of clogs, which she cannot resist. She puts them on and whirls into one of Ashton's most celebrated numbers, which also features the dancers using the clogs to perform sur la pointe (on their toes). Ashton's 1960 version of La fille mal gardée has been staged for many companies throughout the world and has become the more or less \\"traditional\\" version, replacing the productions derived from the Petipa/Ivanov/Gorsky versions danced in Russia to the music of Hertel. Among such companies are the Bolshoi Ballet (2002), and American Ballet Theatre (2004). In spite of this, the famous La Fille mal gardée pas de deux, which is taken from the Petipa/Ivanov/Gorsky versions of the ballet, is still performed with regularity as a gala excerpt, and is often used by various young dancer on the ballet competition circuit. After Ashton's death, the rights to his staging of La fille mal gardée passed to Alexander Grant, the original performer of the role of Alain. In the 1981 version, the role of Alain was performed by Alexander's brother Garry Grant. In 2007, the Paris Opéra Ballet invited Alexander Grant to supervise a staging of Ashton's version, which premiered at the Palais Garnier on 22 July 2007 with Dorothée Gilbert as Lise, Nicolas Le Riche as Colas, Simon Valastro as Alain, Stéphane Phavorin as the Widow Simone and Gil Isoart as the Piper. As part of a contract between the BBC and the Royal Ballet signed in 1961, La fille mal gardée was one of nine ballets filmed for television, and was broadcast over Christmas 1962 with the original cast.The Royal Ballet on BBC TV. About the House, November 1962, p29. In 1984, Ashton's production was filmed at Covent Garden, with Lesley Collier as Lise, and Michael Coleman as Colas. A later recording, featuring Marianela Nunez and Carlos Acosta, was made in 2005. Both recordings are available on DVD. Synopsis Lise and Colas are in love and want to marry. However, the Widow Simone wants Lise to marry the dimwitted, but extremely rich, Alain, and has arranged (with Alain's father Thomas) for a marriage contract between Lise and Alain. The Widow Simone does her best to keep Lise and Colas apart, but is unsuccessful in her attempts to do so. At harvest time the Widow Simone and Lise are taken to the field for a picnic lunch by Thomas and Alain. The farm workers join in a ribbon dance around a maypole, and the girls also join in a clog dance with the Widow Simone. There is a thunderstorm and everyone rushes for shelter. Alain is carried away on the wind by his open umbrella. The Widow Simone and Lise return to their home. The widow wants Lise to sit down at the spinning wheel and spin, but Lise spins while she is up dancing, nearly strangling the widow. After a while, the widow wants Lise to dance, and Lise shows signs of unhappiness, but obliges. The widow takes a tambourine to play in time with Lise's dancing. When the widow is asleep, Lise tries to steal the key from the widow's pocket, to prevent the widow from locking her in, but is unsuccessful. The crops are brought in by the farm workers, and the widow then leaves the house (after locking the door behind her to prevent Lise from leaving the house). Lise thinks about Colas and mimes being the mother of a large number of children. To her embarrassment, Colas suddenly rises from the stacked crops. At the sound of the Widow Simone's returning to the house, Lise and Colas look around desperately for a place where he can hide. Not finding anywhere suitable in the living room, Lise takes Colas to her room, and she returns to the living room just before Widow Simone enters the house. The Widow Simone orders Lise to go to her room and put on her wedding dress for her forthcoming marriage to Alain. The horrified Lise tries to remain where she is, but the Widow Simone pushes Lise into her room and locks the door. Thomas arrives with his son Alain (who is still clutching his umbrella). They are accompanied by a notary who is to act as witness to the marriage. The farm workers (friends of both Lise and Colas) also arrive. The Widow Simone gives Alain the key to Lise's room. When Alain unlocks the door to Lise's room, Lise appears in her wedding dress, accompanied by Colas. Thomas and Alain take offence, and the enraged Thomas tears up the marriage contract. Thomas, Alain and the notary leave the house in dudgeon. Lise and Colas then beg the Widow Simone to look favourably upon their suit. Love conquers all and the widow relents. Joyfully celebrating the happy outcome for Lise and Colas, everyone leaves, and the house is left quiet and empty, until Alain returns for his umbrella which he had accidentally left behind. So Alain is also happy with the love of his life – his umbrella.

In 1982, outraged by the violent attacks against gays by the Bishop of Strasbourg, he decided to write his autobiography and to denounce the atrocities he suffered. Coda's film recalls the testimony of other victims of Nazi persecution of homosexuals and describes the pseudo-scientific experiments to which many of them were subjected by the SS physician Carl Vaernet.Carl Vaernet made studies of a preparation containing hormones. His aim was to \\"cure homosexuality\\". About 80% of the prisoners forced to take part in the experiment with injections of massive doses of testosterone died.

It encompasses 315 contributing buildings, 16 contributing sites, and 35 contributing structures. The district includes the agricultural landscape and architectural resources of an area distinctively rural that contains numerous large antebellum and postbellum estates, and several smaller 19th-century farms, churches, schools and African-American communities. Long Marsh Run Rural Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. The district The contributing buildings are primarily farm and estate residences and their associated outbuildings. There are approximately 60 such contributing complexes in the district. Other contributing buildings include four schools, four churches, two mills, two mill sites, and a post office. Three small African-American communities are also included, some with their original school and church. The 35 contributing structures are mostly corncribs (and 6 metal windmills), and the 16 contributing sites are mainly cemeteries and ruins of historic buildings. and Accompanying photo and Accompanying map Fairfield is a Georgian-style plantation house built of native limestone around 1770 at the center of a 1,600-acre landholding. In addition to being the oldest building in the district, Fairfield was the home of Warner Washington (1715-1791), a first-cousin of George Washington, and is considered to be the best example in the district of the importation of a Tidewater plantation to the Shenandoah Valley. ;The LaRue Estates Long Marsh Run, the creek for which the district was named, was first settled by the LaRue family in the 1740s. Today, four homes associated with the LaRue family survive. The first is Bloomfield, which was built by Jacob LaRue in 1775. A two-story, double-pile, coursed limestone structure, Bloomfield is the oldest Larue home still standing. Jacob's father, Isaac, built his home, Claremont, a short distance away in 1778. Claremont is a two-story, three-bay, coursed limestone, vernacular building very similar in form to Bloomfield. It may have replaced Isaac's original log cabin from the 1740s. Jabez LaRue built his home, Villa LaRue, a few miles to the east of Bloomfield and Claremont in the 1790s. As a side-passage-plan dwelling, it is unique for its use of coursed limestone in the front and random rubble on the sides and back. Just to the south of Villa LaRue is Longmarsh, which was also built of stone around the same time as the others. The original two-story, two-bay section of this house is small and was supposedly an overseer's house for Villa LaRue.

The mine is located in the centre of the country in Ontario. The mine has estimated reserves of of gold.  Operation  Musselwhite mine uses a gold cyanidation and CIP (carbon in pulp) extraction process. Ore is extracted via a blast hole process and moved via a series of scoop-trams and underground dump trucks to one of 2 rockbreakers, either on the surface or at a 400 meter level. The ore then travels once through a jaw crusher and through a series of conveyor belts and continuously along a cone crusher rock sizing circuit. When the ore reaches a specific size it is transported to the mill building where the ore passes once through a rod mill and multiple times through a ball mill until the slurry is ground to approximately 10 μm. The slurry is then thickened, exposed to a cyanide treatment to extract it from the ore and into the solution, absorbed from the solution with activated carbon, rinsed off the carbon, passed through an electrowinning process and finally melted in a furnace and poured into 25 kg bars. The leftover tailings are passed through an INCO/SO2 cyanide destruction process. The remaining tailings are sent thRough a final thickening stage and are pumped into the tailings pond composed of approximately 85% solids and very little cyanide. Twice a year the excess water is drained off the tailings pond where it flows naturally through a series of polishing ponds and a freshwater marsh. By the time the runoff reaches the natural watershed system the cyanide content is drastically reduced and poses no environmental or safety hazard. The total recovery of this process is approximately 96%. Electrical power is proved by a 115 kV running from Ear Falls to Pickle Lake and a private line from there to the site. Due to the provided utility's capacity, the site only has access to about 19.5 MW, stalling further development plans such as a mine shaft. Additional power as required or in the event of an outage is provided by a series of large diesel generators on site.  Safety  Due to its remote nature (approximately 197 km from the nearest town, Pickle Lake, Ontario) safety is a major priority. An air ambulance may take upwards of 2 or more hours to transport an injured worker to Thunder Bay, due to this time factor and the general health of the 300-500 workers at the site an Occupational Health Nurse is on site and trained in the treatment of any foreseen incident, such as the administration of sodium thiosulfate and hydroxocobalamin in the event of cyanide poisoning. In addition the mine was the first gold mine in Canada to sign the International Cyanide Management Code. All who may work in areas where contact with cyanide is a possibility are required to undergo treatment training for cyanide poisoning, due to the speed which cyanide can kill a victim prompt first aid treatment with amyl nitrite is essential until the victim can be treated with injections of sodium thiosulfate and hydroxocobalamin. The \\"Musselwhite mine\\" surface repair shops are also home to a tire cage large enough to handle the tires from the CAT 990 loader or any comparable large tire when maintenance is required on them.  Transportation  Musselwhite is a fly-in fly-out operation using the Opapimiskan Lake Airport. The rotations for production and maintenance crews are generally 12-hour days 14-in 14-out. Due to the mine being a year-round operation these rotations entitle 168 working hours every 28 days, comparable to a standard 40-hour work week. This is in contrast to seasonal jobs in logging, oil drilling and mineral exploration where the rotations have longer \\"in\\" times but only run for part of the year. Transportation of personnel is contracted to Wasaya Airways. The Dash 8 300 series was purchased by the airway specifically for the transportation of personnel from Thunder Bay to the mine. Other service points to the mine include Pickle Lake and Sioux Lookout. Material (fuel, parts, explosives, reactants for processing, etc.) transportation is done by truck from the south. Due to the remote nature of the area any vehicles coming to the mine are required to contact a member of the security team before leaving Pickle Lake and embarking onto the Northern Ontario Resource Trail. Approximately 150 km from Pickle Lake traffic leaves the Northern Ontario Resource Trail and enters the mine road, travelling the remaining 43 km to the mine. Traffic arriving at the site then notifies the security team of their arrival, due to non-existent cellphone reception at the site or along the road a log of traffic must be kept. If a traveller has been out on the road for an unusual amount of time (generally 3 hours during the summer months) and cannot be reached by radio it is assumed they have encountered difficulty and a team is sent out to find them. The process is reversed for road traffic travelling the other direction. This procedure is vital in the winter months where the temperatures can drop to below and a driver experiencing engine trouble could otherwise be in a disabled vehicle without heat until another vehicle passes.

It was originally written to be included as a divertissement in a 1977–78 production of Strauss's operetta Die Fledermaus by the Royal Opera, alongside an adaptation of the Explosions-Polka, and first performed as an independent piece by the Royal Ballet in late 1978. Background The Royal Opera performed Die Fledermaus for New Year's Eve 1977; this was the company premiere of the work, produced by Leopold Lindtberg and featuring, among others, Hermann Prey as Eisenstein and Kiri Te Kanawa as Rosalinde. The performance was broadcast live in Britain on BBC 2 and BBC Radio 3, and was relayed to the United States where it was repeated on television later in the day.Performance details: Die Fledermaus, 31 December 1977 The production contained two additional Strauss pieces, choreographed by Ashton as ballets: the Frühlingsstimmen waltz and the Explosions-Polka. These appeared in Act II of the operetta, part of a ball scene. The Explosions-Polka was performed by an ensemble cast, while the Frühlingsstimmen waltz, a pas de deux was performed by Merle Park and Wayne Eagling.Programme 2012/13, p. 25 In September 1978, the Frühlingsstimmen waltz dance was premiered as an independent piece, under its English name Voices of Spring, at the Ambassador Auditorium in Los Angeles.Work details: Voices of Spring Description Frühlingsstimmen itself is a short piece with no plot, around eight minutes long. It is a lively Viennese waltz and the dance is suited to the music; it has a strong sense of effortless and joyful movement, strongly influenced by the boldness of the Bolshoi Ballet.Programme: Ashton 100 Celebrations; Programme 2012/13, p. 10 It is performed by one male and one female dancer, neither named and both simply identified as \\"Dancer\\".Programme: Ashton 100 Celebrations Critical reception Reviews of the first performance did not focus on the dance, but the Times described it as \\"danced admirably and a great improvement on the Explosions-Polka\\".The Times, 3 January 1978 The 1980s independent performances were likewise not heavily remarked upon. In the 2004 revival, the Guardian noted that while not the centrepiece of the performance, Voices was \\"the kind of crowd-rousing display that suits programmes of highlights\\". Revivals The piece is rarely performed, but was revived for performance by the Royal Ballet in 1981 and 1983, when it was again performed by Eagling and Park, then in 2004 and 2012.Production details: Voices of Spring In 1981, it was part of a programme of varied works and replaced a performance of the pas de deux from Sylvia, which Ashton had decided should not be performed out of the context of the main ballet.Programme: 2 April 1981 The 2004 performance at the Royal Opera House was part of a series of Ashton works performed to mark his centenary, danced by Mara Galeazzi and Viacheslav Samodurov, and was coached in part by Merle Park. The Royal Ballet also marked the centenary with performances at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York in July,Performance details: Voices of Spring; and in England later in the year, danced by Alina Cojocaru and Johan Kobborg.

It contains a single species, Kazaklambia convincens. Discovery and naming Kazaklambia was first described in 1968 as a species of Procheneosaurus by Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky: Procheneosaurus convincens. The specific name refers to the fact that the specimen, the most complete dinosaur fossil ever discovered on Soviet territory, convincingly proved that dinosaurs could be found above the so-called \\"dinosaur horizon\\". After having for a time been referred to as Corythosaurus convincens, it was given its own genus in 2013 by Phil R. Bell and Kirstin S. Brink. Their new genus name means \\"Kazakh lambeosaurine\\", referring both to its discovery location and its classification. Kazaklambia is known from a nearly complete skeleton of a juvenile missing only the snout, the front of the lower jaws, some dorsal vertebrae and end of the tail, holotype PIN 2230, found by G.A. Belenkiy in 1961.G.A. Belen’kiy, “Geological structure of the Tashkent area Chule,” Tashkent Gos. Univ., New Series, No. 181, pp. 1-181, 1961 Although some studies considered it to be possibly synonymous with Jaxartosaurus aralensis, others found the species to be valid. Description Bell & Brink suggested that Kazaklambia is morphologically distinct from other Eurasian taxa and known juvenile lambeosaurines at a similar ontogenetic stage in having a prefrontal process of the postorbital with a thickened dome lateral to the frontal dome, doming of the nasal above and in front of the orbit, and a frontal length/width ratio of less than one. Classification Bell and Brink (2013) assigned Kazaklambia to the Lambeosaurinae, in a basal position. Morphometrics and morphological information suggest that Kazaklambia might be closely related to the basal lambeosaurines from Asia Amurosaurus and Tsintaosaurus, which was seen as proving an Asian origin of the Lambeosaurinae.

Lapped transforms substantially reduce the blocking artifacts that otherwise occur with block transform coding techniques, in particular those using the discrete cosine transform. The best known example is the modified discrete cosine transform used in the MP3, Vorbis, AAC, and Opus audio codecs. Although the best-known application of lapped transforms has been for audio coding, they have also been used for video and image coding and various other applications. They are used in video coding for coding I-frames in VC-1 and for image coding in the JPEG XR format. More recently, a form of lapped transform has also been used in the development of the Daala video coding format.

It was among the twelve original baronies of the Principality of Achaea, but passed into the hands of the Latin Archbishop of Patras at about the middle of the 13th century. From 1337 on, it was an ecclesiastical domain independent of the Principality. It maintained close relations with the Republic of Venice, which governed the barony in 1408–13 and 1418. The barony survived until the Byzantine reconquest in 1429–30.  History  The Barony of Patras was established ca. 1209, after the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Crusaders, and was one of the original twelve secular baronies within the Principality of Achaea. With twenty-four knight's fiefs attached to it, Patras, along with Akova, was the largest and one of the most important baronies of the Principality.Miller (1921), pp. 71–72Bon (1969), pp. 106, 450 Patras was in addition the seat of a Latin Archbishopric, which ranked as a distinct ecclesiastic vassal fief with eight knightly fiefs to its name.Miller (1921), p. 72 Relations between the Archbishop and the secular barons, and indeed with the Prince himself, were initially strained. This was due to quarrels between the Archbishop and the Prince over the Latin clergy's allegiance and obligations to the Principality, and resulted in such incidents as the baron's forcible eviction of the Archbishop from his residence and the cathedral of St. Theodore, which were incorporated into the Patras Castle.Bon (1969), p. 450Miller (1921), p. 78 According to the French, Greek and Italian versions of the Chronicle of the Morea, the secular barony was granted to a knight from the Provence, William Aleman, but the Treaty of Sapienza between Achaea and the Republic of Venice, concluded in June 1209, mentions Arnulf Aleman as baron, probably William's otherwise unknown predecessor. In addition, the Aragonese version of the Chronicle lists a completely different, but unverifiable series of barons, beginning with Walter Aleman, who was succeeded by his son Conrad and he in turn by William (II), who then sold the rights to the barony to the Archbishop of Patras ca. 1276.Bon (1969), pp. 106–107, 450 Historians have generally followed this account in dating the cession of the barony to the Archbishopric to about or shortly after the middle of the century, but the transfer may have taken place, or at least begun, as early as the 1220s, for the first Archbishop, Antelm of Cluny, is said to have had possession of the Patras Castle by 1233.Schabel (2008), pp. 121–122 The Archbishop now found himself, with thirty-two fiefs, as the strongest vassal of the Principality, and became a major factor in its affairs. Under William Frangipani (1317–1337) in particular, Patras enjoyed close relations with Venice and acted practically independent from the Prince.Bon (1969), pp. 450–451Topping (1975), p. 118 As a result, when Frangipani died in 1337, the Angevin bailli Bertrand of Les Baux, whom Frangipani had opposed, laid siege to the city hoping to reduce it to obedience. In the event, Pope Benedict XII reacted by declaring the city \\"land of the Holy Roman Church\\" and placed the Principality under the interdict. The mother and regent of the Prince, Catherine of Valois, conceded to the Church's demands. As a result, the Archbishop became independent, although his secular fiefs still owed allegiance and services to the Prince.Bon (1969), p. 451Topping (175), pp. 124–125 For the remainder of the century, the Archbishops of Patras played an active role in the intrigues and feuds of the Principality, and in turn the contending families often tried to place one of their own scions on the archiepiscopal throne. However, the increasing Ottoman threat on the Greek mainland and the depredations of the Albanians led the Archbishops to turn increasingly to Venice for protection; after several entreaties to secure its protection, in 1408 the Republic took over the administration of the barony, although it remained Church territory, in exchange for a rent of 1,000 ducats a year. This move was opposed by the Pope, however, and in 1413 Venice returned the administration to the Archbishopric; another attempt in 1418 again faltered at the opposition of the Holy See.Bon (1969), pp. 451–452Topping (175), pp. 161–162 Finally, in 1429/30, the city and the citadel were surrendered to the Byzantine Greeks of the Despotate of the Morea under Constantine Palaiologos, the future last Byzantine Emperor.Bon (1969), p. 452Topping (175), p. 165 References Sources  * * Category:States and territories established in 1209 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1429 Category:History of Patras Category:Baronies of the Principality of Achaea Category:Medieval Achaea ","title":"Barony of Patras"},{"id":"39747147","text":"The Drama of the St. Mary's Church Tower (Polish:Dramat Wieży Mariackiej) is a 1913 Polish silent drama film directed by Wiktor Biegański and starring Włodzimierz Kosiński, Helena Górska and Władysław Puchalski.

In his music career, he has written five studio albums with Doogie White and the band La Paz. In his business career, he is on the Board of Directors of six UK companies, one U.S. Company and one Mexican company. He has also written two crime fiction novels published by Wild Wolf Publishing He was awarded Officer Of The Order Of The British Empire (OBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours List in 2018  Early life and music career  McSherry was born in Lanark, Scotland and lived most of his early life in Viewpark. He formed the rock band La Paz with vocalist Doogie White in 1984 and they developed a strong songwriting partnership. They played gigs around the UK for four years and released two albums on cassette before White left in 1988 to join melodic rock combo Midnight Blue and then went on to sing with Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, Yngwie Malmsteen, Tank and Michael Schenker. In January 2008, McSherry and Doogie White were invited to reform and play at Rock Radio's 1st Birthday Bash. They played a 5 number acoustic set to almost 1000 people in The Garage, Glasgow along with other performers (GUN, SAHB, Thunder, Logan, and The Almighty). The show resulted in La Paz reforming as a full band and playing live again for the first time since 1988. They played several shows in Scotland from 2008 through 2009 and in 2010 they secured a recording contract with Metal Mind Productions releasing their debut album \\"Granite\\" in February 2012. McSherry wrote most of the songs with White (with the exception of the ballad \\"Amy\\" - White/Mason) and also co-produced the album. Following on from Granite, McSherry again collaborated with Doogie White to write 10 songs for a follow up album, \\"The Dark And The Light\\", which was released by Metal Mind Productions in May 2013. McSherry wrote and arranged the music and also produced this album. The promotional single from the album, Don't Drink With The Devil, was voted Number 1 Track Of The Week in the Classic Rock Magazine reader's poll. The subsequent album review in the August 2013 edition of the magazine by Neil Jeffries singled out McSherry's part in the production of the work. La Paz headlined the opening night at the 2014 Hard Rock Hell Festival on 20 March. The new La Paz album, \\"Shut Up And Rawk\\", written by McSherry and White and produced by McSherry was released by Metal Mind Productions in April 2016 and the band reformed to play at a launch party at The Cathouse, Glasgow on 31 March. The show was recorded and may be released as a live CD in future.  Other professional activities  After Doogie White left La Paz in 1988, McSherry concentrated on his business career and developed his software company, Prosys, into an international business. During that time the company targeted the US market and was known for its innovative training and staff development programs. Prosys was the first IT company in the UK to be accredited an Investor In People. He served on the board of The Campaign For Learning alongside (former Sir) Fred Goodwin and became a regular spokesperson in various media outlets on the merits of developing people to improve business growth. Prosys were successfully re-accredited as Investors In People three times. In 1997 he was asked to set up a subsidiary business for UK based TIS Software Ltd in Melbourne, Australia and he was invited by Professor Richard Weaver at Glasgow Caledonian University to be a guest speaker on their MBA in Entrepreneurial Studies. In 2003 he was involved in advising the Scottish Government on their broadband strategy and in 2004 he created a US company, iport software Inc, based in Houston, Texas, servicing the oil and gas sector. This move to open a permanent US office came about after a strategic review of the business options for Prosys post 9/11 and as a result he became part of the Global Scot Network. He has been an Agency Contact for The Bank Of England's Regional Monetary Policy Committee since 2005 and provides market and economic information to the Bank Of England's Agency for Scotland which, in turn, feeds into the Bank's Inflation Policy Reports. Due to the retirement of his business partner, McSherry sold the assets of Prosys to Trinity Computers in 2006 and concentrated on iport4business Limited, which became iPort Group International in 2010 after a 40% stake in the company was sold to the investment group, Coralinn. A 2013 profile in The Herald, a Glasgow newspaper, stated that it was this that was a catalyst for his move into the Mexican marketplace. This resulted in the development and creation of iTravel-Cabo.com, an interactive tourist information website and bookings system. In 2017 he created a new business - Big Red Digital Ltd by merging several of the existing iPort businesses together. McSherry is a business mentor for Scottish Enterprise. and is involved in helping start-up and high-growth companies reach their full potential. He is also a Director of Lanarkshire Enterprise Services Limited, part of the Business Gateway network in Scotland. He holds a further Non- executive Director post with Second City Creative, an online digital training business, and is the Senior Partner in AchieveMore, a sales training and leadership development company. He also contributes to local children's charities in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.  Writing career  McSherry was a regular contributor to the business columns in both The Herald and The Scotsman newspapers during the 1990s. These occasional articles led to being offered a regular column called “Get a Grip” in the business magazine, UP! He wrote a collection of essays on travel and fishing that was accepted for publishing by Jonathan Quiller of Swan Hill Press. The resultant book Game Fishing Diaries was published in the US in February 2004 by iUniverse. He has also written two crime-fiction novels: Waging War To Shake The Cold and Lone Star, both published by Wild Wolf Publishing Limited.

Blandy bequeathed 700 acres of his approximately 900 acre estate to the University of Virginia, which accepted it after his death in 1926. The University began its program of agricultural biology at Blandy in 1927, and converted part of the landscape into an arboretum, now known as the Orland E. White Research Arboretum. The slaves quarter's, referred to as the Quarters, was converted into laboratories and student and faculty housing. In 1941, the Quarters building was greatly enlarged with the addition of three Colonial Revival wings. This addition created a \\"U\\"-shaped building with the original Quarters section as the east wing. A research greenhouse was built at the same time.

Děpolt II (1150s – 21 November 1190), also known as Diepold II (modern English Theobald), was a Bohemian nobleman from the cadet branch of the Přemyslid dynasty and the leader of the Bohemian troop in the Third Crusade.  Life  Děpolt II was the only son of Děpolt I (son of Duke Vladislav I of Bohemia) and of his wife Gertrude (daughter of Albert the Bear of Brandenburg). He was first mentioned after the death of his father. He had a good relationship with the Duke Frederick of Bohemia (Czech: Bedřich), his cousin. After 1182 he was in dispute with his other cousin Bishop of Prague Jindřich Břetislav (Henry Bretislaus, later known as Duke Bretislaus III of Bohemia). The bishop imposed an interdict on Děpolt's land (the regions of Čáslav, Chrudim and Vraclav). In 1187 he emigrated and came back in 1189 when Conrad II became the new duke of Bohemia. In 1189 Conrad II appointed Děpolt I to lead the Bohemian troop in the Third Crusade. The Bohemian troop joined the crusaders led by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in Esztergom, Hungary. Many of the Bohemian soldiers were former prisoners who were freed just to participate the crusade (8 of them were executed by Frederick Barbarossa because of their violence and robbery already in Serbia). After the death of Frederick Barbarossa in the Saleph River on 10 June 1190 Děpolt II decided to stay in the Holy Land and to continue under the command of Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia. He took part in the siege of Acre in autumn 1190. There he also died on 21 November 1190, maybe because of a war injury or plague. The surviving rest of his troop then probably became a part of the troop of King Richard I of England.

She represented Chinese Taipei in two editions of the Olympic Games (1996 and 2000), and later captured a bronze medal in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay (8:18.92) at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand. Hsieh made her first Chinese Taipei team, as a 15-year-old teen, at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. She failed to reach the top 16 final in the 100 m butterfly, finishing in thirty-seventh place at 1:04.39. A member of the Chinese Taipei squad, she placed nineteenth in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay (8:27.61), and twenty-fourth in the 4 × 100 m medley relay (4:38.90). At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Hsieh drastically shortened her program on her second Olympic appearance, swimming only in the 100 m butterfly. She achieved a FINA B-cut of 1:03.25 from the National University Games in Taipei. Swimming in heat two, she pulled away from the rest of the field by more than half a second (0.50) to a top seed, from start to finish, in a sterling time of 1:03.52. Hsieh's effortless triumph was not enough to put her through to the semifinals, as she placed forty-first overall on the first day of prelims.

Although never selected at international level he was part of the British Isles team who took part in the 1888 New Zealand and Australia tour, the first British overseas tour. Early life and family Joseph Thomas Haslam was born in 1863 in Birmingham, which at the time was in Warwickshire. He was christened on 15 March 1863 at St James the Less, Ashted, Warwickshire.England, Births and Christenings, 1538-1975. Salt Lake City, Utah: FamilySearch, 2013. He was the son of a joiner, William Haslam and his wife Rose Anne. His mother was from Paisley, Scotland, whilst his father was from Thornhill, West Riding of Yorkshire. Joseph had at least four siblings, an older brother Gerard, two younger sisters Mary Ann and Louisa and a younger brother Charles. By 1881 the family was living in Batley, Yorkshire where Joseph was a warp beamer in a woolen mill.Class: RG11; Piece: 4548; Folio: 104; Page: 29; GSU roll: 1342095 Rugby career Haslam represented Batley, first turning out for the senior XV in October 1882 and played to a significantly high level to have also been chosen to play rugby at county level for Yorkshire. In 1888 he was offered a place as part of the British Isles team to tour Australia and New Zealand, signing the contract in January. Although the tour was not recognised by the Rugby Football Union, being set up as a private venture, the game is now retrospectively acknowledged as the very first tour of the British and Irish Lions. Haslam was one of two full backs chosen for the tour along with Swinton's Arthur Paul. Haslam played his first game for the British Isles against Otago on 28 April 1888, the opening game of the tour. The British Isles won 8-3 but without Haslam on the scoresheet. He missed the second game again Otago, but rejoined the squad to play Canterbury to record his first points of the tour, scoring two of the five British tries in a 14-6 win. Haslam played in a total of 29 of the 35 matches, scoring a total of 11 tries. On occasion he was also given kicking duties with a single conversion credited to him in the game against an Adelaide XV. He also added a drop goal against Ipswich, a match in which he finished top scorer having also scored a try. As well as being a key member of the British Isles squad, Haslam is also noted as one of the earliest exponents of the dummy pass, if not the inventor of the technique within the rugby code.

During World War II he chose to go into exile in England and the United States rather than remain in Vichy France. Leon Hervé Charles de Lyrot was born on 26 May 1885 in Montmorency, Val-d'Oise. He inherited the title of Count. He made his career in banking. Hervé de Lyrot married Emilie De Villahermose. His wife was the daughter of Auguste Dreyfus, who had made his fortune in the Peruvian guano trade, and Luisa Gonzales Obregon, marquise de Villa Hermosa. Their son, Count Alain Herve de Lyrot, was a reporter and correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune, spokesman for the French Ministry of Information, and then held various jobs related to publication. In 1930 Hervé de Lyrot founded a chair of French at the Catholic University of Lima. Hervé de Lyrot entered politics in 1932, when he ran for parliament on an anti-cartelist Republican platform and was elected in the second round as deputy for Ille-et-Vilaine. He was reelected to the same seat in 1936 as the Republican and National Union candidate. He supported improving communications and cultural relations between France and various South American republics. He supported improvements to inland waterways in the north and east of France, and electrification of rural communities. He was strongly in favor of giving women the vote, helping organize sessions and present the case for women's suffrage in parliament. Hervé de Lyrot was absent at the 10 July 1940 vote by the Vichy Congress on giving Marshal Pétain the powers he had demanded. He was concerned about racist threats against his wife, who was of Jewish origin. He and his fellow deputy Henri de Kérillis flew in Hervé de Lyot's plane from Bordeaux to Jersey, from where the English took them to Exeter on 15 June 1940. He was in the United States in September 1942, when he signed a letter sent to General Charles de Gaulle by five members of the French parliament. The other signatories were Kerillis, Pierre Mendès France, Édouard Jonas and Pierre Cot. He left parliament in 1942, and did not seek reelection after France was liberated. Hervé de Lyrot died in the 16th arrondissement of Paris on 21 June 1956 at the age of 71.

He is best known for his doctoral dissertation entitled \\"IQ and Immigration Policy,\\" and a Heritage Foundation report he co- authored on the economic costs of illegal immigration to the United States which concluded that passing the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 would cost taxpayers more than $6 trillion. Education Richwine received his bachelor's degree in mathematics and political science from American University, graduating in 2004. He then studied at Harvard University, where he received his PhD in 2009 in public policy, with a dissertation entitled \\"IQ and Immigration Policy\\". His dissertation stated that illegal Hispanic immigrants to America had lower IQs than non-Hispanic whites, and noted that this disparity persisted for several generations. The dissertation committee was composed of economist Richard Zeckhauser, economist George Borjas, and Christopher Jencks, the social scientist and editor of The American Prospect. Richwine subsequently wrote an article for Politico defending his dissertation and arguing that the statements it contained about ethnic differences in IQ were \\"scientifically unremarkable\\". Career Prior to working at Heritage, Richwine worked briefly at the American Enterprise Institute; while there, he wrote a book review for The American Conservative criticizing Richard E. Nisbett's book Intelligence and How to Get It. In 2010, he wrote two pieces about immigration and crime for the online magazine AlternativeRight.com in response to a Ron Unz essay covering the same topic in The American Conservative. After a study co-authored by Richwine regarding the costs of illegal immigration was released by the Heritage Foundation, former Washington Post reporter Dylan Matthews found the dissertation and wrote a blog post about it on May 8, 2013. Richwine argued that Hispanics and blacks are intellectually inferior to whites and have trouble assimilating because of a supposed genetic predisposition to lower IQ. Richwine resigned from the Foundation on May 10, 2013. As of 2017, Richwine had contributed on occasion to National Review. He continued his controversial research, and published an article in the American Affairs journal entitled \\"Low-Skill Immigration: A Case for Restriction\\". Richwine joined the Heritage Foundation in 2009 after he received his PhD in public policy from Harvard. Titled \\"IQ and Immigration Policy\\", he writes on this work: > \\"No one knows whether Hispanics will ever reach IQ parity with whites, but > the prediction that new Hispanic immigrants will have low-IQ children and > grandchildren is difficult to argue against. \\"the totality of the evidence > suggests a genetic component to group differences in IQ, but the extent of > its impact is hard to determine. \\"The statistical construct known as IQ can > reliably estimate general mental ability, or intelligence. The average IQ of > immigrants in the United States is substantially lower than that of the > white native population, and the difference is likely to persist over > several generations. The consequences are a lack of socioeconomic > assimilation among low-IQ immigrant groups, more underclass behavior, less > social trust, and an increase in the proportion of unskilled workers in the > American labor market.\\" A later work for the Heritage Foundation released in 2013, of which Richwine is co-author with Robert Rector, claims that the immigration reform bill then being weighed in the U.S. Senate would cost the government $5.3 trillion. As a criticism, on May 6, 2013, Dylan Matthews wrote for The Washington Post: \\"The study represents the most notable attack on the reform effort to date from a conservative group ... So does the Heritage estimate hold up? Not really. They make a lot of curious methodological choices that cumulatively throw the study into question. It's likely that immigrants would pay a lot more in taxes, and need a lot less in benefits, than Heritage assumes, and that other benefits would outweigh what costs remain.\\" References Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:American anti–illegal immigration activists Category:American political commentators Category:American political writers Category:American social commentators Category:American University alumni Category:John F.

Monotones II was created first as a gala piece for a gala performance in aid of the Royal Ballet Benevolent Fund in 1965. Ashton had long been inspired by the Gymnopedies by Erik Satie of 1888 and took orchestrations by Claude Debussy and Roland-Manuel as the basis of a pas de trois for two men and one woman. The premiere was on 24 March 1965 with Vyvyan Lorrayne, Anthony Dowell, and Robert Mead. The piece was a great success - so much so that in 1966 Ashton enlarged the piece so that it would be long enough to be performed in the normal repertory, by the addition of Monotones I, which formed an overture to the earlier work. This piece in many ways forms a mirror image of Monotones II. Based on Satie's Gnossiennes, it is another pas de trois, but in this case for two women and one man; the premiere was given by Antoinette Sibley, Georgina Parkinson, and Brian Shaw. Ashton took his cues in choreographing the ballet from the form, structure and inspiration of Satie's music. The ternary structure of the Gymnopedies and Gnossiennes supports what has been referred to as a \\"trinitarian obsession\\" of Ashton's.Vaughan, p.345-6 The two sections of the work also represent a contrast between the earthiness of the Gnossiennes in Monotones I – where the characters wear green costumes, engage in weighty and accented lunges, and shield their eyes from the sun – and the celestial, infinite and seamless qualities of the Gymnopedies in Monotones II, where the dancers are white-costumed, lit from above, and perform suspended arabesques, the men lifting the woman to \\"walk on air.\\"Kavanagh, pp.486–7Vaughan, pp.345–6Jordan, pp.28–9 The work uses classical language in its choreography and, like his Symphonic Variations, represents a pinnacle of Ashton's own classicism.Cohen, p.156 On his death, Ashton's will left the ballet to the care of Tony Dyson, now chairman of the Frederick Ashton Foundation.

The album follows on from various singles that they released and their tour with Esben and the Witch.  Background and recording  Heliotropes formed in 2009 by Jessica Numsuwankijkul and Amber Myers when Numsuwankijkul posted an advert on Craigslist, initially trying to find musicians to perform Brian Eno- style music, but they found this to hard. They played a show with Astrid Pierce and one of the members, Cici Harrison, eventually joined the band a year later. On the subject, Numsuwankijkul said \\"I remember being like, “Oh, we wish she was in our band” and then a year later, she was.\\" Nya Abudu answered the advert on Cragslist and the line-up was complete. They began to form their sound, instead of playing Eno-style songs. The band signed to Manimal Vinyl in 2012 and released various single, three of which would appear on their first album. The album was recorded between 2012 and 2013. The title of the album comes from a song originally titled \\"A Constant Sea\\", but they didn't have enough time to record it.  Packaging  The album cover features artwork by Nor Ashraf, a Malaysian artist that the band met over the internet. Numsuwankijkul said that once she'd seen it she thought that it would always be the album cover. She also said she sees it as a follow up to the \\"Ribbons\\" cover, taken by Koen Jacobs of a Ram who had just finished drinking some water.  Release  After the recording, they went on their first US tour with Esben and the Witch. The band released a new song titled \\"Psalms\\" as a free download on the Rolling Stone website.

In a racing career which lasted from August 2001 until November 2003 she won six of her fifteen races including four at Group One level. As a three-year-old she won the Musidora Stakes, and after disappointing in The Oaks, she returned to win the Nassau Stakes and the Yorkshire Oaks. At four she raced creditably against male opposition before returning to all-female competition to win a second Yorkshire Oaks and the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. Despite racing only once in North America in 2003 she was voted American Champion Female Turf Horse at the Eclipse Awards. Background Islington is a bay mare with no white markings bred in County Meath by the Ballymacoll Stud. She was one of at least eight Group/Grade One winners sired by the fourteen time champion sire Sadler's Wells. Her dam Hellenic won the Yorkshire Oaks and the Ribblesdale Stakes as well as finishing second in the St Leger Stakes. She went on to become an outstanding broodmare, producing Greek Dance (Bayerisches Zuchtrennen), Mountain High (Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud) and New Morning (Brigadier Gerard Stakes). Islington began racing in the colours of the Ballymacoll Stud's owner Arnold Weinstock. She was trained throughout her racing career by Michael Stoute at the Freemason Lodge stables in Newmarket and ridden in all of her races by Kieren Fallon. Islington had a nervous disposition and often sweated heavily before her races. Racing career =2001: two-year-old season= Islington made her first appearance in an evening meeting at Newmarket Racecourse on 17 August, when she finished sixth of the ten runners in a seven furlong maiden race. Despite her defeat, the filly was moved up in class for her next race, the Listed Oh So Sharp Stakes at Newmarket on 6 October. Starting at odds of 5/1 she briefly took the lead two furlongs from the finish before running third behind Protectress and Snowfire. =2002: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut, Islington was dropped back to maiden company for a ten furlong race at Newbury Racecourse on 19 April. She started the 4/6 favourite in a field of sixteen runners and won comfortably by one and a half lengths. In May, the filly started odds-on favourite for the Musidora Stakes at York Racecourse, a trial race for the Oaks Stakes. She took the lead three furlongs from the finish and won by a length from Spinnette with Alexander Three D (later to win the Park Hill Stakes) in third. On 7 June, Islington was one of fourteen fillies to contest the 224th running of the Oaks at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Racing on soft ground she tracked the favourite Kazzia, but after briefly moving up to challenge the leader early in the straight she faded in the closing stages to finish eighth. Following the death of Lord Weinstock in July, the ownership of Islington passed to the executors of his estate for the remainder of her racing career. Two months after her failure at Epsom, Islington was brought back in distance for the ten furlong Nassau Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse, where her opponents included Quarter Moon, who had finished eighteen and a half lengths in front of her when finishing second in the Oaks. Fallon settled the filly in fourth place before taking the lead two furlongs from the finish. Islington went six lengths clear of the field before being eased down in the closing stages to win by four lengths from the Prix Marcel Boussac winner Sulk. Eighteen days later, Islington was matched against the Oaks winner Kazzia in the Yorkshire Oaks. Fallon tracked the leaders on Islington before overtaking Kazzia two furlongs from the finish and drawing clear to win by five lengths from the Oaks d'Italia winner Guadelupe. Islington's next start was in Europe's most prestigious all-aged race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse on 6 October. Starting at odds of 7.2/1 she took the lead in the straight but was overtaken 100 metres from the end of the race and finished fifth, two lengths behind the winner Marienbard. On her final appearance as a three-year-old, Islington was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Arlington Park, Chicago. She finished third of the twelve runners behind Starine and Banks Hill. =2003: four-year-old season= As a four-year-old, Islington did not appear until June, when she contested a very strong renewal of the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot. She finished third behind Nayef and Rakti, with Falbrav fifth, Grandera seventh and Moon Ballad ninth of the ten runners. In the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse, Islington was never better than third and faded in the closing stages to finish sixth behind Falbrav. On 20 August, Islington returned to York for her second Yorkshire Oaks in which she was opposed by the 2003 Oaks winner Casual Look. Starting at odds of 8/11, Islington took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by a length from Ocean Silk, with Casual Look unplaced. After the race, Stoute identified the Arc and the Champion Stakes as likely targets. In September, Islington was sent to Ireland for the Irish Champion Stakes. In a rough and controversial race, she finished third, beaten a neck and a head by High Chaparral and Falbrav, with the favourite Alamshar in fourth place. Islington was then sent to America for her second attempt at the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf. At Santa Anita Park on 25 October, she started 100/30 favourite in a field which included Tates Creek (Yellow Ribbon Stakes), Musical Chimes (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches), Voodoo Dancer (Diana Handicap), Yesterday, Heat Haze (Beverly D. Stakes), Mezzo Soprano (Prix Vermeille) and Dimitrova (Flower Bowl Invitational Stakes). The favourite raced in fourth as Bien Nicole opened up a ten length lead before coming back to the field approaching the straight. Islington accelerated in the closing stages and took the lead inside the final furlong to win by a neck from the Irish-trained outsider L'Ancresse. After the race Stoute said \\"I was always happy with her position\\", Stoute said that \\"it was a little tight on the turn, but as soon as we straightened for home, I knew she would win. She is a wonderful filly. There are not many better. Last year she had bad luck at Arlington.\\" On her final appearance, Islington contested the Japan Cup at Tokyo Racecourse but made little impression, finishing ninth of the eighteen runners behind Tap Dance City. Assessment and honours Islington was voted American Champion Female Turf Horse in the Eclipse Awards for 2003. She received 90 votes, beating Heat Haze (74) and the Breeders' Cup Mile winner Six Perfections (66). Stud record After her retirement from racing, Islington returned to the Ballymacoll Stud to become a broodmare. Despite being sent to leading stallions including Rainbow Quest, Dansili and Gone West, she has yet to make an impact as a dam of winners.

He later took some lessons in painting at an Auckland studio but was largely self-taught. He married in 1918 and worked by operating river launches in the Te Aroha region. Fiji In the early 1920s Belcher moved to Fiji where he managed a shooting gallery in Suva. There his artistic talents were recognised by American ornithologist Casey Wood who took him on a bird collecting expedition on which he started illustrating the birds seen and collected. He was later employed by Rollo Beck on the Whitney South Seas Expedition. He travelled through the Fiji islands studying and painting the birds as well as the orchids. Belcher married for a second time in 1938, to Rose Tapa’au Adams, a Samoan from Apia. He died in Fiji at the age of 66 and was buried in the Old Suva Cemetery.

When France surrendered to the Germans in 1940 he left the country. He was stripped of his citizenship and his property seized. After the war he was made a member of the Legion of Honor. In 2011 it was agreed to return two of the seized paintings to his heirs. Early career Édouard Jonas was born in Paris on 9 May 1883, son of an antique dealer. He followed his father in this profession. He was of Jewish origin. Jonas specialized in 18th century works. Until mid-1932 he owned a large antique shop in New York, but it was closed due to lack of sales in the depression. He kept open his gallery at Place Vendome & Rue Castiglione in Paris, a fashionable location. His wife had been married to David Schulte, owner of a chain of cigar stores. He became curator of the Musée Cognacq-Jay while acting as a consultant to the customs department and a foreign trade adviser. Between 1924 and 1932 Jonas was one of the supporters of Jean Ossola, a member of parliament. In the April–May 1936 national election, Édouard Jonas won a seat in parliament representing Grasse, Alpes-Maritimes, on the Socialist and Republican Union platform. He was elected on the second round. He was a member of the committee on education and fine arts, and then president of the committee on public works. Jonas was a target of anti-Semitic attacks in France before World War II (1939-1945). Thus on 7 January 1939 Le Progrès provençal ran a hostile article titled \\"Jonasseries\\" that referred to his \\"Ashkenazi\\" Jewish origins. World War II Portrait of a Man with a Dog by anonymous German artist: one of the looted paintings acquired by Hermann Göring When the Nazis invaded France in 1940, Jonas managed to ship the contents of his antique store from Paris to Bordeaux for safe keeping. At Vichy, Jonas did not take part in the 10 July 1940 vote on the draft constitutional law delegating powers to Marshal Philippe Pétain. On 27 July 1940, Le Progrès provençal published a violent attack on Jonas, who had fled. Jonas expressed hostility to the Vichy regime, and as a result on 6 September 1940 he was stripped of his French nationality by decree. On 27 September 1940 his property in Grasse and Antibes was sequestered. On 27 December 1940 another decree removed him from office. The Direction des musées sequestered art work from his collection, and those of other Jews. In November 1940 Jonas was in Canada. In an interview, he said that the French government had been wrong to capitulate to the Germans, and should have escaped to North Africa. A supporter of General Charles de Gaulle, he said that the French people supported the British in their struggle against Adolf Hitler, but their leadership was lacking. Jonas was in the United States in September 1942, when he signed a letter sent to General Charles de Gaulle by five members of the French parliament. The other signatories were Henri de Kérillis, Hervé de Lyrot, Pierre Mendès France and Pierre Cot. Later years After the war, Jonas was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor. He died in Paris on 3 December 1961 at the age of 78. Two of Jonas's paintings were seized in Bordeaux in 1940 in the name of Hermann Göring. In 1944 Göring gave them to Alois Miedl, an art dealer, in exchange for a Vermeer painting (which turned out to be a Han van Meegeren forgery). After the war, the Netherlands Art Property collection ended up in possession of the paintings. In December 2011 a committee recommended returning the works to Jonas's heirs. The two paintings were Anonymous Portrait of a Man with a Dog and Théobald Michau's Landscape with cattle in a shallow river. The Germans were not the only ones to seize Jewish property. In October 1940 four crates containing artwork that had been taken from France were seized in Bermuda and sent to the National Gallery of Canada. In 1949 the crates were opened and the contents divided between Martin Fabiani and Edouard Jonas, who was acting for the sisters Jeanne and Léontine Vollard. Jonas noticed that a small watercolor by Paul Cézanne was missing. Jonas and then his widow, Assunta Jonas, made numerous inquiries but were refused information by the National Gallery. It was only in April 2013 that the gallery acknowledged that it had possession of the watercolor.

The other party, usually an insurer, receives the payment but takes on responsibility for meeting those liabilities. Since the liabilities associated with a fund, particularly those associated with defined benefit schemes, are not known precisely at the time of the buyout (as they depend upon how long the members live and investment returns on the fund assets among other factors), the transaction is regarded as a form of de-risking for the sponsor. From 2006 onwards, buyouts of this sort have become increasingly popular in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Pensioner buy-ins are an alternative to pension buy-outs where the financial contract is retained within the pension fund for the benefit of all members not just those members whose benefits are covered by the contract. Pensioner buy-ins are particularly popular in the United Kingdom as they benefit from more favorable accounting treatment and require a lower cash injection from the sponsor. As of 2014, insurers involved in the market in the United Kingdom include Aviva, Legal & General, Pension Insurance Corporation, Prudential and Rothesay Life, while notable sponsors who have recently sought to offload their risk include Verizon and General Motors in the United States and Akzo Nobel and Total in the United Kingdom.

The Shinto religion has historically been used as a means to express Japanese nationalism and ethnic identity, especially prior to the end of World War II. In its association with Shinto, sumo has also been seen as a bulwark of Japanese tradition. Sumo can be traced back to ancient Shinto rituals to ensure a bountiful harvest and honor the spirits known as kami. In modern times, the canopy over the sumo ring, called the dohyō is reminiscent of a Shinto shrine, the officiator is dressed in garb very similar to that of a Shinto priest, and the throwing of salt before a bout is believed to purify the ring. Prior to becoming a professional sport in the Tokugawa period, sumo was originally performed on the grounds of a shrine or temple. The present dohyō, which is still considered sacred, is in honor of the days when matches were held on the sacred grounds of shrines and temples. The roof over the dohyō called yakata originally represented the sky for the purpose of emphasizing the sacred nature of dohyō, which symbolizes the earth. On the day before the beginning of each tournament, the dohyō-matsuri, a ring-blessing ceremony, is performed by sumo officials called gyōji. They are the referees on the dohyō, who judge each sumo match. Their elaborate, colorful costumes are based on ceremonial court robes of the Heian period (AD 794 – 1185). Also their black hats are exact copies of the hats worn by Shinto priests depicted in various Heian art. Dressed in the white robes of a Shinto priest gyōji purify and bless the dohyō in a solemn ceremony during which salt, kelp, dried squid and chestnuts are buried in the center of the dohyō. Observing officials and invited guests drink sake, Japanese traditional alcoholic drink as it is offered to each one in turn. The remaining sake is poured over the straw boundary of the dohyō, as an offering to the gods. Shinto ritual still continues to pervade every aspect of sumo. Before a tournament, two of the sumo officiators known as gyōji functioning as Shinto priests enact a ritual to consecrate the newly constructed dohyō. Each day of the tournament the dohyō-iri, or ring-entering ceremonies performed by the top divisions before the start of their wrestling day are derived from sumo rituals. This ceremony involves them ascending the dohyō, walking around the edge and facing the audience. They then turn and face inwards, clap their hands, raise one hand, slightly lift the ceremonial aprons called kesho-mawashi, and raise both hands, then continue walking around the dohyō as they leave the same way they came in. This clapping ritual is an important Shinto element and reminiscent of the clapping in Shinto shrines designed to attract the attention of the gods. The yokozuna's ring-entering ceremony is regarded as a purification ritual in its own right, and is occasionally performed at Shinto shrines for this purpose. Every newly promoted yokozuna performs his first ring-entering ceremony at the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo. Ceremonial sumo wrestling ring at Setagaya Hachiman shrine in Tokyo.

Lake Beulah  =Community= The unincorporated community surrounds the freshwater Lake Beulah. The lake covers an area of 812 acres with a maximum depth of 58 feet. Two summer camps, YMCA Camp Edwards and Beber Camp, also use the lake for recreational purposes. = Ecology = Lake Beulah contains a variety of different species within the lake. Many species of fish can be found in the lake, including: Panfish, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Northern Pike, Walleyes, Redbreast Sunfish, Catfish, Crappie, Bluegill, and Cisco. The lake is also home to Painted Turtles, Smooth Softshell Turtles, and Snapping Turtles. Curly-Leaf Pondweed, Eurasian Water-Milfoil, Hybrid Eurasian / Northern Water-Milfoil, and Zebra Mussels can also be found in the lake. Wood ducks and Canadian geese are also present on Lake Beulah. = History =  Early history  The lake was formed at some point in the 1830s following the construction of the wooden Yonman-Johnson dam (which now forms part of Wisconsin County Highway J), creating a lake between East Troy and Mukwonago. In 1894 , the Lake Beulah Protective and Improvement Association (LBPIA) was established with the aim of \\"improving and protecting Lake Beulah and the streams and waters adjacent thereto.\\" By 1904, the association had improved the lake strengthening the dam, introducing wall eyed pike, and formulating regulations regarding the display of lights on watercraft. The association successfully managed to get the dam further strengthened with cement in 1909, which allowed for the lake to be maintained at a set height all year round. A weed cutter was then purchased by LBPIA and led to the removal of weeds and tree stumps which had previously clogged some channels surrounding the lake.  Post World War Two  The end of the Second World War brought with it the advent of the commercial speedboat. Such crafts became a common occurrence on the lake and led to the issuance of a revised 'Code of Good Conduct' in 1963 which was issued to all lake front property owners. By the 1990s, the major issue on the lake was the spread of invasive species, particularly the Eurasian Water Milfoil.  Lake Beulah Yacht Club  The Lake Beulah Yacht Club was established in 1893. Its members have been nationally recognized in sailboat racing, winning prestigious awards. The Rolex Yachtswoman of the Year Award was presented to Stephanie Roble and Annie Haeger in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Haeger also went on to represent the USA at the 2016 Olympics, finishing 7th in the women's 470. Notable people *Frank L.

The band formed in the Summer of 1973 when during a holiday in the Spanish resort of Lloret de Mar, Geertjan Hessing, Erwin van Prehn, Aart Mol and Cees Bergman decided to form a band. The four were veterans of the Dutch rock scene but had achieved little success up to that time. Later that year keyboard player Michael Eschauzier joined them. The band's name was suggested by Golden Earring vocalist Barry Hay. They released their first single, \\"Hit The Big Time\\", produced by ex Golden Earring drummer Jaap Eggermont early in 1974 and it reached no. 16 on the Dutch Singles Chart. Keyboardist Eschauzier was replaced in April 1974 by Elmer Veerfoff. The band had several hit singles between 1974 and 1975, the most successful being \\"Let Your Hair Hang Down\\" which reached no. 5 on the Dutch Singles Chart. As glam rock became less popular Catapult's fortunes took a downturn and they split up in 1979. The band continued to work together though, forming a production company called \\"Cat Music\\" and recording as Rubberen Robbie with some success in the Netherlands and Belgium.

In 2016 the building was renovated to become a restaurant for the Upland Brewing Company. The building stands on the banks of the East Fork of the White River at the foot of Second Street in Columbus, IN, Indiana. From 1903 to 1951 it served as the city's water works and pumped water from the river for domestic use; it also produced electricity for the city's street lighting. The city sold the property in 1952 and it was renovated to become Southern Machine Company. With a 1976 renovation it became the home to the \\"Senior Center\\", which used the building until 2011 when that group relocated into the newly built Mill Race Center. It is currently a brewpub operated by Upland Brewing Company. http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/story/31714109/uplands-pump-house- project-coming-along History Top photo shows the northwest elevation of the Pump House before it was outfitted with dynamos to generate electricity; the bottom is a postcard showing the small addition on the west side of the basement to house the dynamos. The first pumping station for the city Water Works was built on the same site as this one in 1871 at the cost of $54,000 and contained a set of large water pumps made by Holly Manufacturing Company in Buffalo, NY that could pump up to 3,000,000 gallons of water per day. Residents of Columbus called this structure \\"the Holly Works.\\" =Construction of the Albright building= By the turn of the century, the city had begun planning improvements to the facility. At this time, the mayor of Columbus was George W. Caldwell, a building contractor, whose company Caldwell & Drake was currently building the West Baden Springs Hotel—this building was also designed by the architect Harrison Albright. In 1901 the city let the contract to Dunlap and Company of Columbus to begin construction of the new building designed by Albright right on top of the first structure. This building began service in 1903 with new centrifugal pumps, which could pump up to 8,000,000 gallons of water per day. By 1904, a small addition was made to the northwest corner to accommodate dynamos that produced enough electricity for the city street lights. =Southern Machine Company ownership= This city used this building until 1951, after which time it began using a deep well system as a water source. In 1952 the building was sold to Ray and Martha Smock, owners of Southern Machine Company. With some alterations and renovations, it operated as a machine shop. The building was purchased by the Columbus Redevelopment Commission in 1972 at a cost of $65,000 with the intention to use it to help revitalize the downtown area; it later was deeded to the City of Columbus. For a few years, the Columbus Redevelopment Commission took up residence in the building. Part of the space was also from 1972-1974 as a fabrication workshop for Jean Tinguely's monumental sculpture, Chaos 1, which was installed in The Commons in 1974. =Columbus Senior Center redevelopment= By 1975 a community effort led to the city hiring architect James K. Paris to draft plan to renovate the building that would accommodate the expanding Senior Center Club. With Community Development funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, nearly $400,000 was used to renovate and repair the structure. The work began in 1976, and was completed by Taylor Brothers Construction. The project included moving the main entrance to the southeast corner of the building, providing easier access to off-street parking. Previously, this area consisted of two large wooden doors and was used as a coal chute in order to load in enough fuel to power the dynamos. Interior of the main room of the Columbus Pump House in 2013 The new entrance added three windows and metal double doors. The original slate roof was replaced with an asphalt shingle type roof and the heating and air conditioning system was replaced. Years of soot and grime were cleaned from the interior and exterior of the building. Alterations were made to the interior to accommodate the various interests of the Senior Center Club, including the installation of ramps over stairs, the addition of an elevator, and a large shuffleboard playing area. With these renovations it successfully operated as the Senior Center until this club moved to the Mill Race Center, which opened in 2011. Original design and construction Construction for the Albright building started in September 1901. The larger footprint of this building allowed for it to be built around the previous brick building, which itself had been built over the original, wooden \\"Holly Works\\" structure. The brick and stone building has stone foundation of two-foot thick slab and 17-inch walls on all sides. The two color brick scheme provides accent around the windows and doors, highlighting the arches over the windows. The hip-roofed structure was originally covered with gray, clay tiles and had a number of ventilation stacks protruding high above the roof line. =Relationship to the East Fork of the White River= Construction of the 1903 water filter in Columbus, Indiana with the Second Street Bridge visible in the background. The location of this building is directly related to the river from which it pumped water. A simple filter was built into the East Fork of the White River in 1903 and directed water into a cistern 10 feet in diameter and 35 feet deep. This filtration system was used until 1913 when a new one was developed that was based on a rapid sand filter and relied on a testing laboratory inside the Pump House to insure the potability of the water. Until 1952 the Second Street Bridge (also called the \\"Wagon Bridge\\") stood next to this building. The new Tipton Bridge opened in 1952. The eastern abutment for the Second Street Bridge was renovated in 1996 with funding provided the local group, \\"The River Rats\\", to become an overlook area that has also been an area to exhibit outdoor sculpture. Historical status While multiple publications have indicated that this property is among those listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Bartholomew County, Indiana, this is not true. The property was surveyed in both the 1980 and 2012 Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory (IHSSI). This architectural inventory is administered by the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology (DHPA), also called the survey program. Since 1978, Indiana Landmarks has partnered with the DHPA by conducting the survey on a county-by- county basis. In the 1980 survey it was listed as \\"Outstanding\\" and in the 2012 survey it was listed as \\"Notable.\\" References External links * Classicism and Concrete; Harrison Albright's Architectural Contributions to Coronado * Columbus Redevelopment Commission *Columbus Area Visitors Center Category:Columbus, Indiana Category:Buildings and structures in Bartholomew County, Indiana Category:Government buildings completed in 1901 ","title":"Columbus Pump House"},{"id":"39747889","title":"2013 European Diving Championships – Men's 3 metre springboard"},{"id":"39747894","title":"Doping at the Asian Games"},{"id":"39747898","text":"Giada Di Miceli (born 18 January 1987 in Rome) is an Italian television presenter and radio personality.

(Sierra Leone), known as just Manchester City F.C. or Manchester City (Salone) in their home country, is a Sierra Leonean football club based in Freetown, Sierra Leone, currently a member of the Sierra Leone National First Division, the second highest division of football league in Sierra Leone. Founded in 2004, the club is an offshoot of the local Manchester City F.C. supporters club, which as of 2009 was the largest non-UK based Manchester City supporters club in the world. Previously not self-sufficient, the club funds itself via using the team mini-bus, donated by UK-based supporters, as a rental taxi/coach service although all kit is donated by other Manchester City (UK) supporters clubs and the English club themselves. History Following a chance meeting with a British national Manchester City fan, Armani Kamara – who made the connection while selling bric-a-brac on the Freetown beaches – created a Manchester City (UK) supporters club in his home town of Freetown. Shortly after, off the back of the popularity of his supporters club, he made the decision to create two teams – a senior team and an affiliated youth side – which began playing in local leagues. Quickly, the Manchester side themselves offered to help out, and donated official match- worn 2003–04 season kits. Within a year, the youth side won its first competition, a local area cup competition. In 2008, the club won its first national honour – the Sierra Leonean FA Youth Cup, only four seasons into its existence. The senior team slowly worked its way into the national league system. They would then be suspended for failure to appear at their away games; the club was unable to finance away games and could only make it to those games within walking distance. An appeal was lodged with the British club, and appeals to others to support their predicament. Club legend Paul Lake spearheaded a campaign to have the public provide what was needed. Among the donations were: a Toyota Coaster mini-bus, equipment, uniforms and textbooks. The club took advantage of the vehicle to raise income by hiring it out to the public when not needed by the team.

These include proven allegations of match-fixing to hazing. Match-fixing Kiyoseumi was forced to retire after an investigation found him guilty of match-fixing. Due to the hierarchical structure of the sport, where top ranked wrestlers have great advantages in salary and status over lower ranked wrestlers, speculation about the existence of match-fixing and isolated reports of match fixing have surfaced over the years.Hongo, Jun, \\"Sumo-rigging born of necessity?\\", Japan Times, February 9, 2011, p. 3.Kyodo News, \\"Ex-sumo attendant says match-fixing nothing new\\", Japan Times, February 10, 2011, p. 1. The Japan Sumo Association (JSA) repeatedly denied any wrestlers were involved in match-fixing, known as yaocho, and even took publishers to court over such allegations.Martin, Alex, and Mizuho Aoki, \\"Are fixed bouts final nail in sumo coffin?\\", Japan Times, February 4, 2011, p. 2. However, in 2011, it was announced that an investigation by police had discovered cell phone text messages indicating that a number of matches had been fixed.Buerk, Roland, \\"Japan's sumo hit by match-fixing claims\\", BBC News, 2 February 2010. Retrieved February 4, 2010. Allegedly, 14 wrestlers and a few stablemasters were involved. In the course of the investigation, several wrestlers eventually admitted to match-fixing for money.Hongo, Jun, and Natsuko Fukue, \\"Three admit to throwing sumo bouts \\", Japan Times, 4 February 2011, p. 1. As a consequence, the board of directors of the JSA decided in an extraordinary meeting to cancel the March 2011 tournament in Osaka, the first time this had happened since 1946. In all, fourteen wrestlers were judged guilty of match- fixing, to which most of them admitted involvement. All of the wrestlers judged to be involved were forced to retire. The JSA's investigative panel stated in May 2011 that match-fixing appears to have been widespread. The panel stated that it would be difficult to discover, however, the full extent of the problem.Kyodo News, \\"Sumo panel concedes match-fixing deep-rooted\\", Japan Times, May 20, 2011, p. 2. The May 2011 tournament went ahead but with no sponsorship, live TV coverage or trophy presentations, and was referred to as the \\"Technical Examination Tournament\\". One wrestler charged with match- fixing, Sōkokurai, strenuously denied any involvement and won a court case in early 2013 deeming his dismissal groundless. He was subsequently reinstated by the JSA, and appeared in the July 2013 tournament in the top division. Gambling and yakuza ties On July 4, 2010, the Japan Sumo Association announced its decision to dismiss the ōzeki Kotomitsuki and the stablemaster Ōtake, former Takatōriki, for betting on baseball games in a gambling ring run by the yakuza. At the same time, two stable masters were demoted and an unprecedented 18 wrestlers banned from the July 2010 tournament. Sumo Association chairman Hanaregoma declared in August 2010 that \\"violent groups or antisocial forces\\" were being banned from accessing tournament venues, training stables and other facilities. Three months before Hanaregoma's announcement, Japan's largest yakuza group, Yamaguchi-gumi, bought fifty prized seats during a tournament so that gangsters were prominently visible during the national broadcast of the match. According to experts, this was an endeavor to cheer up an incarcerated boss. Although there have always been alleged ties between sumo and the yakuza, the sport has suffered from waning public interest and sponsorship during the economic recession, which may have contributed to closer ties to the underworld for financial support. Hazing It has been well-known and accepted for many years that sumo stables engage in the systematic hazing and physical punishment of young disciples in order to \\"toughen them up\\". Stable masters have often been proud to show to the media how they frequently use a shinai to beat those who fall out of line, and elder wrestlers are often put in charge of bullying younger ones to keep them in line, for instance, by making them hold heavy objects for long periods of time. However, this system of hazing was widely criticized in late 2007 when a hazing scandal came to light, in which a 17-year-old sumo trainee named Takashi Saito from the Tokitsukaze stable died after a serious bullying incident involving his stablemaster Jun'ichi Yamamoto hitting him on the head with a large beer bottle and fellow rikishi being subsequently ordered to physically abuse him further. The stablemaster and three other wrestlers who were involved were arrested in February 2008, after which Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda demanded the JSA take steps to ensure such an incident never happens again. In May 2009, Yamamoto was sentenced to six years in jail. Women and sumo Professional sumo excludes women from competition and ceremonies. Women are not allowed to enter or touch the sumo wrestling ring (dohyō), a tradition stemming from Shinto and Buddhist beliefs that women are \\"impure\\" because of menstrual blood. The female Governor of Osaka from 2000–2008, Fusae Ohta, when called upon to present the Governor's Prize to the champion of the annual Osaka tournament, was required to do so on the walkway beside the ring or send a male representative in her place. She repeatedly challenged the JSA's policy by requesting to be allowed to fulfill her traditional role as Governor. Her requests were repeatedly rejected until the end of her five-year term. In April 2018, during a non-tournament sumo event in Kyoto Prefecture, two women rushed to the aid of the mayor of Maizuru when he collapsed in the middle of the dohyō. While the women were attempting to provide emergency treatment, a referee repeatedly asked them to leave the ring. The chairman of the Sumo Association later apologized for what he called an inappropriate response, saying that he greatly appreciated the women's efforts. The view of those who criticize this continuing \\"men-only\\" policy is that it is discriminatory and oppressive. In general, women in the sumo world are only expected to be supportive wives of the wrestlers, and, in the case that their husband has become a stablemaster, a surrogate mother for all of his trainee wrestlers. The view of the JSA is that this is a tradition that has been firmly maintained through the centuries, so it would be a dishonor to all of their ancestors to change it. This was not always the case. Starting as early as the 18th century a form of was performed in some areas of Japan. In the cities it was more of a spectacle often associated with brothels. However, in some areas of Japan female sumo had a serious role in certain Shinto rituals. In later years, there were limited tours of female sumo that lasted for a time. However, female sumo is not considered to be authentic by most Japanese and is now prohibited from taking place beyond amateur settings.

Plot Elah Bandik (Robert Clarke), the Castithan who fled the battle in the pilot episode, is accused of cowardice by Datak Tarr (Tony Curran) and must undergo a \\"cleansing\\" ceremony which is actually ritual torture and execution. Nolan (Grant Bowler) and Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) intervene and stop the ceremony, but Amanda (Julie Benz) allows the ritual to continue, citing a previous incident in which many Irathient were killed and those remaining left Defiance. Rafe McCawley (Graham Greene) is displeased with his daughter Christie's (Nicole Muñoz) engagement to Alak Tarr (Jesse Rath); he asks her to call off the wedding. Christie seems to have second thoughts; however, Stahma Tarr (Jaime Murray) intervenes, meeting Christie at the diner where she works and changing her mind. Meanwhile, Birch (Steven McCarthy) and Nicky (Fionnula Flanagan), continue with their plan; Birch releases Ben (Douglas Nyback) from his restraints at the hospital and forces him to try another approach. Ben triggers an explosion at the McCawley Mines, trapping himself in a shaft leading deep underground. Rafe McCawley leads Nolan through a series of caverns called \\"The Rat's Nest\\", meeting up with the blocked shaft in the ruins of Old St. Louis. They find Ben attempting to blow up a nuclear power plant. Ben is captured and the bomb is deactivated; Nolan talks Rafe out of killing Ben in revenge for Luke's (Wesley French) death. Ben tells Rafe that Luke was trying to earn money to leave Defiance and his father by helping him, because Luke hated Rafe for what he had done to his mother. Ben then throws himself on McCawley's gun and pulls the trigger. In Nolan's absence, Irisa is incensed by the torture ritual and rescues Elah Bandik. With the help of Tommy (Dewshane Williams), a Deputy Lawkeeper, she arrests Elah as a means of providing protection for him. Datak is furious and tries to retrieve him; Amanda, Nolan and Rafe arrive just in time to prevent further violence and Datak appears to give in. A memorial service is held for those who died defending the town from the Volge. Rafe tries to mourn, but he is struggling to comprehend Ben's final words regarding Luke. He searches Luke's room, discovering maps, a pile of scrip, and a strange gold object. At the end of the episode, Elah Bandik has one last meal with his family, then departs with Datak. Elah is subsequently found dead in front of the lawkeeper's office.

Josh Jackson from Paste magazine rated the episode with 7.5/10 saying that the episode was not flawless but it was promising. \\"It’s not a flawless second episode but it is a promising one. The characters are getting fleshed out, and the plot is thickening. Having the old St. Louis partly preserved down in the mines provides for some cool scenery.\\" Rowan Kaiser from The A.V. Club gave a B- to the episode saying that the it was not any good but it encouraged him to keep paying attention. \\"I may praise “Down In The Ground Where The Dead Men Go” for being audacious, for carrying the momentum from the pilot forward, for not freezing, looking down and collapsing, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that the episode was actually any good.

But there certainly is potential with this series...\\" Jim Garner from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.6/5. \\"\\"Defiance\\" got off to a great start last Monday with the most watched pilot on Syfy since Eureka.

Born in Gelsenkirchen, Rynio played in the Bundesliga for Karlsruher SC, 1. FC Nürnberg, Borussia Dortmund, Rot-Weiss Essen, FC St. Pauli and Hannover 96, appearing in over 450 games in the top two tiers of German football during his career. Career Rynio was born on 1 April 1948, and grew up in Resse, a district in the city of Gelsenkirchen. He started his career in his hometown, playing for VfL Resse 08 before joining Eintracht Gelsenkirchen in the Regionalliga West. In 1967, he joined Bundesliga side Karlsruher SC. He made his debut on 2 September in a 0–0 draw against Alemannia Aachen, and went on to make 21 league appearances during the 1967–68 season as Karlsruhe were relegated to the Regionalliga Süd. Rynio returned to the Bundesliga next season after being signed by reigning champions 1. FC Nürnberg. Rynio appeared 25 times for Der Club, but a disastrous campaign saw the team finish in 17th place, becoming the first league champions to be relegated from the division. Rynio has since been criticised by teammate Ferdinand Wenauer for his role in the team's 2–2 draw with Borussia Dortmund in the penultimate game of the season. Rynio had reportedly agreed to join Dortmund in the summer, and Wenauer felt that the keeper had conceded at least one stoppable goal. Rynio later claimed that he had been unlucky to concede the goal, and although he subsequently did sign a contract with Dortmund at the end of the season, the club had not made him an offer until after the game between the two sides. Rynio played regularly for Dortmund over the next three seasons, making 81 Bundesliga appearances, but suffered relegation for the third time in his career in 1971–72, a season which included an 11–1 defeat to eventual league champions Bayern Munich. He remained with Dortmund following the club's relegation, but made only 11 appearances in two seasons in the Regionalliga West. In 1974, he moved to Rot-Weiss Essen, playing 26 league games in two seasons before moving to FC St. Pauli in 1976. He helped the club win promotion to the Bundesliga during his first season at the club, but were relegated back down to the 2. Bundesliga North at the end of the following season. In 1979, he joined Hannover 96, where he remained in the second division for the next five seasons as first choice goalkeeper. Rynio initially brought his playing career to an end in 1984, but remained with Hannover as a goalkeeping coach. He had a brief spell as head coach at Hannover during the 1985–86 season following the dismissal of Werner Biskup, remaining in charge until the appointment of Jörg Berger in January 1986. During the same season, he came out of retirement to play in goal after an injury to Hannover's first choice keeper Ralf Raps. In the two games he played, Rynio conceded 12 goals – losing 5–0 at home to Bayern Munich, followed by a 7–0 away defeat to VfB Stuttgart. The Stuttgart game was a record defeat for Hannover in the Bundesliga, and three of the goals conceded were penalty kicks scored by Michael Nushöhr – the only player to accomplish this in a Bundesliga game. Hannover were relegated at the end of that season. As a result, Rynio, along with Andreas Keim and Stephan Paßlack, is one of three players to be relegated from the Bundesliga five times, and is the only player to have suffered this feat with five different clubs. Personal life Rynio was a skilled power engineer – a trade which he began learning from the age of 14. After finishing his playing career, Rynio eventually moved away from football and became the manager of Rynio Wohnen KG in Bergen, Lower Saxony, a care home for people with mental and physical disabilities.

Commonly found in the United States Navy, particularly in independent commands at sea, the doctrine is based on the idea of allowing individual officers to show their own initiative in executing actions, freeing up their superiors to focus on the bigger picture.  History and evolution  Most commonly found in the United States Navy, the doctrine evolved in the 1980s, although a variant known as Auftragstaktik was used by the German armed forces in the Second World War. Traditionally, naval engagements had been conducted in the same way for 400 years: the task force commander would coordinate centrally. Improved technology led to warfare moving faster, which necessitated a shift away from central control; a commander had to be able to focus on the wider picture, and would not be able to effectively do that if they were also dictating the actions of every individual subordinate. Command by negation first came into being on individual ships, where it made sense - a captain who delegated authority and exercised command by negation could easily monitor his staff and communicate with them because it was a small environment. Within wider naval engagements, however, the Officer in Tactical Command (OTC) still maintained a rigid control structure, because communications systems simply couldn't work efficiently enough to make loose and autonomous doctrines viable. This changed with improvements in the 1970s and 80s to networking, communications and the amount of information available to an OTC. The introduction of AEW&C; systems, SOSUS and satellite-fed data risked overwhelming the OTC, and so forces were forced to shift towards granting individual commanders more autonomy - something that improved communications made possible. This eventually resulted in the concept of a Composite Warfare Commander (CWC).  Practice  In practice, the doctrine is built around the idea that individual ship commanders or officers will be allowed to undertake autonomous operations. In exchange, they report their intention to do so to their superior officer, noting that the action will be taken \\"UNODIR\\" - UNless Otherwise DIRected - and provide a continual stream of information to the superior officer, who is not required to sign off on the plan or execute it, but only gets involved if the superior objects. Command by negation is the \\"override\\" that allows the superior officer to step in if they take issue with the plan, but otherwise allows the subordinate officer to operate as they see fit. The primary advantage of command by negation are that the doctrine frees up the OTC to look at the bigger picture; unlike in traditional naval warfare, they are no longer required to actively coordinate the actions of each vessel or unit under their command. In addition, it allows individual commanding officers closer to the ground, with a better sense of the tactical position, to operate autonomously and contribute to the task force's overall actions. Command by negation suffers from the disadvantage of autonomous and decentralised command and control generally - that too much information may be generated, increasing the temptation for senior officers to interfere with the actions of individual units and nullify the advantages command by negation provides, and that the (tactically sensible) actions of a subordinate may needlessly escalate any situation.

As indicated by his family name, Bernard Le Roux has French roots, his Le Roux ancestor originated from Normandy.Geni : origin of the Le Roux family On 11 July 2013, he stated to the French sport newspaper L'Equipe, \\"I've done some research, my family originated from the Nantes area. They first moved to Belgium and then to South Africa, a few centuries ago.\\"Aurélien Bouisset, « Le Roux, coeur Bleu » [archive], sur www.lequipe.fr, L'Équipe, 11 juin 2013 (consulté le 11 juin 2013) Career Bernard's rugby career started out when playing for amateur club side A.S.R.V. Ascrum in Amsterdam. In 2009, he represented the Boland Cavaliers in the 2009 Vodacom Cup, where the Cavaliers finished sixth in the Southern Section. He played in just 4 matches that season, all of them brief appearances from the bench. In addition to the Cavaliers, he spent some time with the Border Bulldogs during the 2009 Currie Cup First Division, in which the Bulldogs finished fifth in the Division. Le Roux was tempted by Rugby World Cup winning coach Jake White to sign with the Lions for the 2010 Super 14 season. However, a call the night before he was due to sign the Lions contract convinced him that a short-term medical wildcard contract with Racing 92, then known as Racing Métro, would be better – with the aim of perhaps signing with the Lions after the stint was over. However, Le Roux explains that he \\"fell in love with the country, the culture and the rugby environment\\", and remained on with Racing Métro after his short- term contract. He signed a three-year contract to start with, but a call up to the French senior squad for the 2013 French tour of New Zealand, being eligible through residency laws, was too tempting to decline, and a re-sign with Racing Métro was inevitable after the tour with 'Les Bleus'. He made his first appearance for France when playing against Super Rugby side the Auckland Blues on 11 June 2013. He started in what was a 38–15 victory. Le Roux made his test debut 4 days later in Christchurch, starting and playing the full 80 minutes in a 30–0 defeat to the All Blacks. Since being named in that 38-man squad for the All Blacks tour, Le Roux has featured in every French squad Philippe Saint-André has announced, with Saint-André \\"looking to build something for the next World Cup\\" (the 2015 Rugby World Cup).

In 1895 Bruckner declared that this symphony \\"'\\" (does not count) and he did not assign a number to it. The work was published and premiered in 1924.  Composition  Bruckner composed this symphony from 24 January to 12 September 1869. It was initially designated Symphony No. 2, while the C minor symphony of 1872 was called Symphony No. 3. According to the conductor Georg Tintner, \\"How an off- hand remark, when directed at a person lacking any self-confidence, can have such catastrophic consequences! Bruckner, who all his life thought that able musicians (especially those in authority) knew better than he did, was devastated when Otto Dessoff (then the conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra) asked him about the first movement: \\"But where is the main theme?\\" In 1895, when Bruckner reviewed his symphonies in order to have them published, he declared that this symphony \\"does not count\\" (\\"'\\"). He wrote on the front page \\"'\\" (\\"nullified\\") and replaced the original \\"Nr. 2\\" with the symbol \\"∅\\".C. van Zwol, p. 674 The symbol \\"∅\\" was later interpreted as the numeral zero and the symphony got the nickname ' (\\"No. 0\\"). In the words of David Griegel, \\"Like many other composers, I believe Bruckner was merely being too self-critical, and the unnumbered symphonies are also works worthy of our enjoyment\\". Because of the designation Die Nullte, the biographers Göllerich and Auer felt it was composed before Symphony No. 1. Contrary to this assumption, the autograph score is dated 24 January to 12 September 1869, and no earlier sketch or single folio of this work has been retrieved. The work, which is sometimes referred to as \\"Symphony in D minor, opus posthumous\\", but in English is most often called \\"Symphony No. 0\\", premiered in Klosterneuburg on 12 October 1924.  Editions  The symphony is available in two editions: * First edition by Josef V. von Wöss (1924) * Critical edition by Leopold Nowak (1968)  Description  The score calls for a pair each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, and strings. It has four movements: = First movement = The work begins with a D minor ostinato in the strings: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative a' { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key d \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Allegro\\" 4 = 100 r2 \\\\p r4 a16 a16 d,16 d16  % 2 a16 a16 d16 d16 f16 f16 e16 e16 d8 r8 r4 } ew Staff \\\\relative d { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key d \\\\minor \\\\clef bass \\\\time 4/4 8 \\\\p r8 8 r8 8 r8 8 r8  % 2 8 r8 8 r8 8 r8 8 r8 } >> } Leopold Nowak suggested that the answer to Dessoff's question is that the principal theme is in the first movement of Symphony No. 3 in D minor, which also begins with an ostinato. The second theme group, starting in A major, features syncopated exchanges between the first violins: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative e { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key a \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 100 \\\\stemUp e2.. \\\\p a8 ~  % 2 a8 gis4 fis4 e4 d'8  % 3 << { \\\\voiceOne cis4 r4 r2 s1 cis2 ~ cis8 r8 r4 } ew Voice { \\\\voiceTwo cis,2.. fis8 ~ fis8 eis4 \\\\< d4 cis4 b'8\\\\\\\\! a4\\\\> r4 r2\\\\\\\\! } >> \\\\oneVoice } ew Staff \\\\relative a { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key a \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 8 \\\\p r8 8 r8 8 r8 8 r8  % 2 **8 r88 r8 8 r8 **8 r8  % 38 r8 8 r8 **8 r88 r8  8 r8 \\\\< 8 r8 8 r8 8 \\\\\\\\! r8\\\\>  8 r8 \\\\\\\\! 8 r8 **8 r88 r8} >> } The third theme group is in F major: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative e { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"flute\\" \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 120 << { \\\\voiceOne \\\\stemDown c2. \\\\f r4  % 2 c2. r4  % 3 a'2. r4 } ew Voice { \\\\voiceTwo \\\\stemUp f4. ^( g8 a4 ) r4  % 2 f4. ^( g8 a4 ) r4  % 3 r4 r4 r2 } >> \\\\oneVoice } ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 r4 \\\\f c8 c,8 a'8 f'8 a8 g8  % 2 f8 r8 c8 c,8 a'8 f'8 a8 bes8  % 3 a8 r8 r4 r2 } >> } = Second movement = Nowak places all markings of Andante for this B major movement in parentheses: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative d' { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Andante\\" 4 = 50 << { \\\\voiceOne \\\\stemUp d2 \\\\p es2  % 2 d2 f2  % 3 d2 \\\\< es2 ~  % 4 es4 \\\\\\\\! \\\\> d4 c2 \\\\\\\\! } ew Voice \\\\relative bes { \\\\voiceTwo \\\\stemDown bes2 a2  % 2 bes1 ~  % 3 bes2 c2 ~  % 4 c4 bes4 a2 } >> \\\\oneVoice } ew Staff \\\\relative f { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\clef bass \\\\time 4/4 << { \\\\voiceOne \\\\stemUp f1 \\\\p ~  % 2 f1  % 3 f1 \\\\< ~  % 4 f4 \\\\\\\\! \\\\> g4 c,2 \\\\\\\\! } ew Voice \\\\relative bes, { \\\\voiceTwo \\\\stemDown bes2 c2  % 2 bes2 d2  % 3 bes2 a2  % 4 c4 e,4 f2 } >> \\\\oneVoice } >> } Unlike most other Bruckner slow movements, this movement is in sonata form. The second theme is introduced by the first violins, accompanied by the second violins and violas: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative a { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 50 r2 \\\\p a2  % 2 d,4 e8_\\\\markup { \\\\italic cresc. } f8 g4. gis8  % 3 a8 f'4 e4 d4 c8 ~  % 4 c8 bes8 a8 _\\\\markup { \\\\italic dim. } g8 f4. e8  % 5 e8 d8 r4 r2 } >> } = Third movement = Loud and rather ferocious, the theme has something of the qualities of the Mannheim rocket, but its chromaticism suggests the future music of Shostakovich. : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative d' { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key d \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 3/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Presto\\" 4 = 250 d8 \\\\ff ( -> cis8 d2 ~  % 2 d4 ) a'4 -! d4 -!  % 3 es4 -! e4 -! f4 -!  % 4 fis4 -! g4 -! gis4 -!  % 5 a8 ( -> gis8 a4 ) bes8 c8  % 6 d8 -. e8 -. f8 -. e8 -. d8 -. c8 -.  % 7 bes8 -. a8 -. g8 -. f8 -. e8 -. d8 -.  % 8 cis4 -> c4 -> b4 ->  % 9 bes2 \\\\trill a4 -!  bes4 \\\\trill a4 -! r4 } >> } The Trio's theme in G major has hints of G minor: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative d { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\clef treble \\\\time 3/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Langsamer und ruhiger\\" 4 = 180 d2.^\\\\markup { \\\\italic legato }\\\\p  % 2 d,2 ( a'8 b8 ) % 3 a2 ( g4 )  % 4 fis2_\\\\markup { \\\\italic cresc. } ( g4 )  % 5 bes2.  % 6 es2 ( es,4 )  % 7 e4 ( c'4 bes4 )  % 8 a4 ( g4 f4 ) } >> } Unlike later scherzi, this one has a separate coda for the reprise of the Scherzo. = Fourth movement = The movement begins with a slow introduction, fairly unique for a Bruckner Finale; the only other Finale with a slow introduction is in the Fifth Symphony. The theme in the violins is accompanied by semiquavers (i.e. sixteenth notes) in the woodwinds, and will recur in the development: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative e' { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" \\\\key d \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 12/8 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Moderato\\" 4. = 55 r2. \\\\p r4. e4.  % 2 d4._\\\\markup { \\\\italic cresc. } c4 bes8 a4. g4.  % 3 a4. r8 r1 } >> } This gives way to the main theme of the following Allegro passage, which does double duty as a third theme: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative d { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"trumpet\\" \\\\key d \\\\minor \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"Allegro vivace\\" 4 = 160 d2 \\\\ff -> d,2 ->  % 2 f'2 ~ -> f8 e8 d8 c8  % 3 bes2 -> gis,2 \\\\trill ->  % 4 a4 r4 r2 } >> } The second theme reminds of Rossini:U.

Fish in the Watauga river migrated into the cavern system in the Fall. Each Spring the fish returned to the Watauga river via the opening.

History There are a number of \\"Boone's Cave\\", but the cave in the park is rumored to be the where Squire and Sarah Jarman Morgan spent their first winter, with the then teenage Daniel upon entering the region in 1751, perhaps to escape Native Americans. There was a total of 25 people in the group, with all 10 of the Boones children, and other family members and neighbors who all left Pennsylvania together. The Boone family and everyone else soon built homes near the cave, located next to the Yadkin River. The Boones eventually settled on the opposite banks of the Yadkin River, which serves as a county line and into what is now Davie County, about two miles (3 km) west of Mocksville. Geography The park is approximately 120 acres and supports a variety of flora and fauna native to the area, including a number of hardwoods such as oak, hornbeam and elm. Over 50 different flowering plants such as laurel and wild hydrangea can be found in the park. The cave itself is 140 foot deep from start to finish, but so shallow that most sections require crawling to gain access.

The term can be translated as master of passion. They are sometimes referred to more generally as Bairagis or Sannyasis. The Gosains were powerful nomadic and mercenary trading groups who undertook pilgrimages across significant areas of land. While early British colonists in Bengal Presidency considered them to be marauding robbers, similar to the Banjaras, they were also important to urban economies and the development of wider trade networks. These itinerant religious mendicant groups could be very large in number, with figures in excess of 50,000 being probable for those headed by figures such as Umrao Giri and Himmat Bahadur in the late 1700s. Their numerical strength enabled them to be self-protecting and also to protect the trade routes that they used, regardless of who might have titular power in any given place. Their movements were often dictated by religious festivals, both of a localised village nature and of a more widely celebrated type, such as Holi. As these festivals were also occasions for seasonal markets, so the Gosains were able to move and trade goods between areas. The Nawabs of Awadh, who ruled Oudh State in the 18th and 19th centuries and were Muslim successors to the Mughal empire, recruited from Gosain martial brotherhoods as a way to assimilate influential Hindu elements of society and buttress their own sources of power. This attempt at creating a plural society was in sharp contrast to the zealotry that had characterised their predecessors.

It is about above sea level. The area is remote: the nearest towns are Kaltukatjara some away, Kintore some away and Yulara away. The mountain is mostly made of sandstone. Unapproachable was named by the explorer Ernest Giles in 1872, whilst on an expedition across central Australia. He had just sighted and named Lake Amadeus, and could see the mountain rising to the west. He hoped to find water at the mountain, but was unable to approach it, as his path was blocked by the lake. Giles in fact over-estimated the size of Lake Amadeus and missed the bridge of land between Amadeus and Lake Neale. In 1889, Giles' second-in-command, William Tietkens, returned on his own expedition to survey the area. In his journal, Tietkens wrote that he first travelled to the Bloods Range, to the south of Lakes Amadeus and Neale. He named the highest peaks Mount Harris (for surveyor C. H. Harris) and Mount Carruthers. From the top of Mount Harris, he could see Kata Tjuṯa, the Petermann Ranges and the Tomkinson Ranges. Tietkens then travelled eastward for three days, and reached Lake Amadeus. At the western end of the lake and on the north shore, he described a sandstone range, which he named Long's Range after his brother-in-law. He climbed a nearby set of hills, and identified Mount Unapproachable as the westernmost peak of the Long's Range. He reported that his team reached Unapproachable around the middle of June and then spent several days travelling around the western edge of Lake Amadeus. He corrected Giles' earlier mistake and successfully mapped the lake's western shore. Another team of surveyors visited the area in 1926, led by Donald Mackay and Herbert Basedow. On 1 July, they climbed a hill that, after comparing his own observations with those of Giles and Tietkens, Basedow identified as both Mount Unapproachable and Mount Harris. Basedow concluded that this hill was the Mount Unapproachable that Giles had described, and that Tietkens had mistakenly renamed it Mount Harris. On modern maps, however, Mount Harris and Mount Carruthers are indeed the names given to two peaks in the Bloods Range.

He was also one of the most renowned landscape architects in Sri Lanka and served as the Aide-de-camp to four Governors of Ceylon.BAWA – Family #1251Garden of BriefBevis Bawa on Bevis Bawa’s ‘Brief’ Early life and education Bevis Bawa was born on 26 April 1909 in Colombo, the eldest son of Captain Benjamin William Bawa (1865–1923), a wealthy and successful lawyer, of Muslim and European parentage, and Bertha Marianne née Schrader (1876–1946), who was of mixed German, Scottish and Sinhalese descent. He had one younger brother, Geoffrey Bawa (1919–2003) ten years his junior, who is regarded as being one of the most important and influential Asian architects of the twentieth century. Bawa was educated at Royal College Colombo, but had to leave school at seventeen when his father died while in England. His mother sent him to be trained as a planter at his uncles estates in order to take up the management of the family estate in Aluthgama known as Brief Estate. Military career In 1929, Bawa was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Ceylon Light Infantry, a reservist regiment of the Ceylon Defence Force. In 1934, Lieutenant Bawa was appointed as Aide-de-camp (ADC) to the Governor, Sir Reginald Edward Stubbs; a post held by his father years before. He served sixteen years at the King's House in the staff of the Governor and thereafter the Governor General as the ADC to Sir Andrew Caldecott, Sir Henry Monck-Mason Moore and Lord Soulbury, gaining promotion to the rank of Captain and thereafter Major. He was one of the initial officers of the newly formed Ceylon Army and one of only nine Majors in the army at the time. He retired from the army in 1950, with Captain (later General) Sepala Attygalle succeeding him to the post of ADC to the Governor General. Landscaping Having started running the family rubber plantation known as the Brief Estate in 1929, he began making a garden and developing the estate bungalow while serving in the Army. In 1949 he inherited the estate, which had originally been acquired by his father, from his mother. After he retired from the Army, be made Brief his home and extended its gardens. As the popularity of Brief Gardens grew, he was commissioned to landscape many Embassies, public buildings and private houses in Colombo. Bevis offered sanctuary to a number of Sri Lankan artists including Laki Senanayake, Ena de Silva, the dancers Chitrasena and Vajira and designer Barbara Sansoni. He also played host to a number of international visitors including Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh, the Duke of Windsor, Agatha Christie and Australian artist Donald Friend (who originally planned to stay for a week and ended up staying for six years). He also dabbled in art and sculpture. Bawa continued to develop the property until his death aged 84 on 18 September 1992. He left his estate to his workers and Brief Garden went to his manager Dooland de Silva who himself is a leading Landscape Designer in Sri Lanka. Brief Garden has been is a popular tourist destination since it was open to the public in 1969. Personal life Bawa was intelligent, well-connected and an acute social observer with a flair for art. He was openly homosexual and lived a relatively hedonistic lifestyle. According to his memoirs he was also a pedarast. This is reflected in his estate which contains a number of homoerotic figures and artworks.

He was the first cleric to be appointed to the post, which he kept until 1331. Aside from adjudicating differences between the various feudal lords, his main responsibility during those years was the provisioning of the Achaean fortresses with grain, which had to be imported from Italy.Bon (1969), p. 451Topping (1975), p. 123 After 1330, following Papal policy, he opposed the Catalans of the Duchy of Athens, repeatedly excommunicating them.Bon (1969), pp. 242, 451 Although hitherto a loyal servant of the Principality, after the arrival of a new bailli, Bertrand des Baux, in early 1336, his relations with the princely administration deteriorated quickly: William refused to pay homage to the Prince any longer, and his acquisition of Venetian citizenship signalled the definitive breach.Bon (1969), pp. 211–212, 242–243, 451 Consequently, when Frangipani died in 1337, Bertrand laid siege to Patras hoping to reduce it to obedience before the arrival of his successor, Roger. Pope Benedict XII reacted by declaring the city \\"land of the Holy Roman Church\\" and placed the Principality under the interdict. As a result, Bertrand had to retreat, and the Archbishop became independent, although his secular fiefs still owed allegiance and services to the Prince.Bon (1969), pp. 243, 451Topping (1975), pp. 124–125 References Sources * * Category:13th- century births Category:1337 deaths Category:Latin Archbishops of Patras Category:Barons of the Principality of Achaea Category:Baillis of the Principality of Achaea Category:14th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:14th-century Italian people Category:People from Rome Category:Franciscan bishops Category:Medieval Achaea ","title":"William Frangipani"},{"id":"39748978","text":"Plaque outside Lasseter's Cave recounting the tale of Lasseter's death.

Legacy Due to the aged nature of the content, the potential rights issues concerning footage and the distinct lack of a market, it is unlikely that The Zone will ever see any sort of release on DVD or anything similar. Some dedicated fans and former crew have posted episodes of the show on YouTube, usually captured from VHS tapes that were used to record the show on their first airing. (This is why the SD footage quality is so poor. The recording would depend on the broadcast reception as well as the VCR and tape used.) *1994 Episode 4 This week The Zone features: Reviews: * Tomcat Alley (Sega MEGA-CD) * Sonic 3 (Sega Megadrive) * Flashback (SNES) * The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (SNES) * Super Mario Kart (SNES) * Return To Zork (PC) * NBA Jam Tournament Edition (Arcade) * Art of Fighting (Arcade) *1995 The Final Episode This week The Zone features: * 3DO Competition Drawn Reviews: * Brian Lara Cricket (Megadrive) * ' Little Big Adventure (PC) * Magic Carpet (PC) * The Big Red Adventure (PC) * Jane's Combat Simulations: US Navy Fighters (PC) Music Review: *Band Deadly Nightshades Parody: * TV show Just Kidding * TV show Burke's Backyard * The so-called \\"First Episode\\" with PONG review. Criticism Due to the show's G rating and the early morning timeslot in which it aired, The Zone was unable to show gameplay footage of games with a rating higher than M, which many of the popular titles of the time such as Doom and Mortal Kombat II carried. Rather than simply not covering these titles, the on-screen talent of the show would act out gameplay sequences from these games. Despite being a contributor to a number of magazines, Amos Wong drew the ire of many Nintendo Magazine System readers for reviewing games on Sega platforms on the show.

In the inceptive years of leading Turkish (then Ottoman) football club Galatasaray S.K., which he co-founded, Nikolov was both the club's first manager and first captain. In autumn 1905, Nikolov was, along with Ali Sami Yen, among the thirteen founders of Galatasaray. In Galatasaray's all-time debut game, against Cadi-Keuy FC, Nikolov scored a goal for Gaatasaray's 2–0 victory. Nikolov's height and strength led to him receiving the nickname The Bear. As player-manager, Nikolov also took part in Galatasaray's first league game of the 1906–07 Istanbul Football League, against HMS Imogene FC. Nikolov scored Galatasaray's only goal in a 1–1 draw. Out of nationalist concerns, the name of Nikolov had been erased from the official list of founders of Galatasaray as the Balkan Wars commenced in 1912, along with the names of several other non-Turkish founders. However, the original list with Nikolov's name on it was reinstated after the foundation of the modern Republic of Turkey by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in 1923. The signature of one Boris Nikolov stands on the second copy of Bulgarian football club PFC Slavia Sofia's record of foundation from the early 1930s, reconfirming the club's original establishment in 1913. An article from the Bulgarian-language sports portal Sportal.bg theorizes about this Boris Nikolov being the same person as the co-founder, first manager and first captain of Galatasaray. The article recognizes the lack of any further evidence, other than the fact that multiple Bulgarian footballers returned to that country from Istanbul as the Balkan Wars began and were members of the pioneering football teams of Sofia.

Of the country's row crop farms, rice farms are the most capital-intensive, and have the highest national land rental rate average. In the US, all rice acreage requires irrigation. In 2000-09 approximately 3.1 million acres in the US were under rice production; an increase was expected over the next decade to approximately 3.3 million acres. USA Rice represents rice producers in the six largest rice-producing states of Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas. History =Early history= Wooden mortar and pestle found in the rice loft on Briars Plantation, John's Island (Charleston County), South Carolina. It is believed to have been used in husking and/or polishing rice which was grown on the plantation. The age is unknown. Winnowing barn at the Mansfield Rice Plantation, Georgetown, South Carolina African rice (a separate species from Asian rice, originally domesticated in the inland delta of the Upper Niger River) was introduced to the United States in the 17th century. It is mentioned to have been under cultivation in Virginia as far back as 1609, although it is reported that one bushel of rice had been sent to the colony later, in the summer of 1671, on the cargo vessel William and Ralph. In 1685, a bag of Madagascar rice known as \\"Gold Seede\\" was given to Dr. Henry Woodward. A tax law of 26 September 1691 had permitted payment of taxes by the colonists by way of rice and other commodities. The colonies of South Carolina and Georgia prospered and amassed great wealth from rice planting, based on the slave labor obtained from the Senegambia area of West Africa and from coastal Sierra Leone. One batch of slaves was advertised as \\"a choice cargo of Windward and Gold Coast Negroes, who have been accustomed to the planting of rice.\\" At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from Africa brought the highest prices in recognition of their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice plantations around Georgetown, Charleston, and Savannah. Dikes are used to protect the rice paddy fields from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Karabane, Senegal, 2008; similar delta cultivation techniques were used in West Africa back to at least the 15th century.https://ricediversity.org/outreach/educatorscorner/documents/Carolina- Gold-Student-handout.pdf Similar dike, used to grow rice in the early United States, now abandoned and reclaimed by woodland Enslaved Africans cleared the land, diked the marshes and built the irrigation system, skimming the freshwater layer off the high tide, flushing the fields, and adjusting the water level to the development stage of the rice. Rice was planted, hoed, and harvested with hand tools; plows and harvest wains could be pulled by mules or oxen wearing special shoes. At first rice was milled by hand with wooden paddles, then winnowed in sweetgrass baskets (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the rice mill increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by American millwright Jonathan Lucas was another step forward. Rice production was not merely unhealthy but lethal. One 18th-century writer wrote: > If a work could be imagined peculiarly unwholesome and even fatal to health, > it must be that of standing like the negroes, ankle and mid-leg deep in > water which floats an ouzy mud, and exposed all the while to a burning sun > which makes the air they breathe hotter than the human blood; these poor > wretches are then in a furness of stinking putrid effluvia. Inadequate food, housing, and clothing, malaria, yellow fever, venomous snakes, alligators, hard labour, and brutal treatment killed up to a third of Low Country slaves within a year. Not one child in ten lived to age sixteen. However, in the 1770s, a slave could produce rice worth more than six times his or her own market value in a year, so this high death rate was not uneconomical for their owners. Rice plantations could produce profits of up to 26 percent per year. Runaways, on the other hand, were a problem: > I gave them a hundred lashes more than a dozen times; but they never quit > running away, till I chained them together, with iron collars round their > necks, and chained them to spades, and made them do nothing but dig ditches > to drain the rice swamps. They could not run away then, unless they went > together, and carried their chains and spades with them. I kept them in this > way two years.... :— one overseer's method of controlling slaves, reported > by fugitive slave Charles Ball Most plantations were run on the task system, where a slave was given one or more tasks, estimated at ten hours' hard work, each day. After they had finished the tasks to the overseer's satisfaction, they could spend the remainder of the day as they chose, often on growing their food, spinning, sewing their clothes, or building their houses (slaves were typically supplied with nails and five yards of cloth per year). The task system, and the unwillingness of free people to live in rice-growing areas, may have led to the greater survival of African culture among the Gullah. In the country's early years, rice production was limited to the South Atlantic and Gulf states. For almost the first 190 years of rice production in the US, the principal producers were South Carolina and Georgia. Limited amounts were grown in North Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. =19th century= Plantation workers carrying sheaves of rice, South Carolina, circa 1895 Rice was introduced into the southern states of Louisiana and east Texas in the mid-19th century. Meanwhile, soil fertility in the east fell, especially for inland rice. Emancipation in 1863 freed rice workers. East- coast rice farming required hard, skilled work under extremely unhealthy conditions, and without slave labour, profits fell. Increasing automation in response came too late, and a series of hurricanes that hit Carolina in the late 1800s and damaged levees put an end to the industry. Production shifted to the Deep South,http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-colonial/1875 where the geography was more favourable to mechanization. These events can be seen in rice production statistics. In 1839, the total production was 80,841,422 pounds, of which 60,590,861 pounds were grown in South Carolina and 12,384,732 pounds in Georgia. In 1849, cultivation reached 215,313,497 pounds. Between 1846 and 1861, annual rice production in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia averaged more than 105 million pounds of cleaned rice, with South Carolina producing more than 75 percent. A Civil War era rice barn on a plantation along the Pee Dee River At the census of 1870, after emancipation, the production of rice decreased to 73,635,021 pounds. In 1879, the total area devoted to rice was 174,173 acres, and the total production of clean rice was up again to 110,131,373 pounds. A decade later, the total area devoted to rice cultivation was 161,312 acres, and the total production of clean rice equaled 128,590,934 pounds; this represented a 16.76 percent increase in the amount produced, with a decrease of 7.38 percent in the area under cultivation. Between 1890 and 1900, Louisiana and Texas increased rice crop acreage to such an extent that they produced almost 75 percent of the country's product. Between 1866 and 1880, the annual production of the three states averaged just under 41 million pounds, of which South Carolina produced more than 50 percent. After 1880, their average annual production approximated 46 million pounds of cleaned rice, of which North Carolina produced 5.5 million, South Carolina 27 million and Georgia 13.5 million pounds. The rice industry in Louisiana began around the time of the Civil War. For a number of years, production was small, but during the 1870s the industry began to assume large proportions, averaging nearly 30 million pounds for the decade and exceeding 51 million pounds in 1880. In 1885, the production reached 100 million pounds, and in 1892, 182 million pounds. The great development of the rice industry in Louisiana after 1884 resulted from the opening up of a prairie region in the southwestern part of the state, and the development of a system of irrigation and culture which made possible the use of harvesting machinery similar to that used in the wheat fields of the Northwest, greatly reducing the costs of production. In 1896, yield from the Louisiana rice fields, where harvesting machinery was used, was good. However the milling process was not successful commercially in some rice varieties. The loss due to the milling process was considerable, particularly of the unbroken rice in the \\"head rice\\" variety. =20th century to present= Hauling rice in South Texas, 1909 Rice was established in Arkansas in 1904, California in 1912, and the Mississippi Delta in 1942. Rice cultivation in California in particular started during the California Gold Rush. It was introduced primarily for the consumption of about 40,000 Chinese laborers who were brought as immigrants to the state; only a small area was under rice cultivation to meet this requirement. However, commercial production began only in 1912 in the town of Richvale in Butte County. Since then, California has cultivated rice in a big way, and as of 2006, its production of rice was the second largest in the United States. Production upright=2 Rice culture in the southeast became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the American Civil War, and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century. Today, people can visit the historic Mansfield Plantation in Georgetown, South Carolina, the state's only remaining rice plantation with the original mid-19th century winnowing barn and rice mill. The predominant strain of rice in the Carolinas was from Africa and was known as \\"Carolina Gold\\". The cultivar has been preserved and there are current attempts to reintroduce it as a commercially grown crop. In 1900, the annual production of rice in the US was approximately half the annual consumption. The two principal varieties of lowland rice which were cultivated in the Atlantic States were the \\"gold seed rice\\" and white rice, which were the original rice varieties introduced into the US. Gold seed rice was notable for the larger yield of the grain. It thus practically superseded white rice which was cultivated in the earlier years. Experiments with upland rice demonstrated that it could grow over large areas of the country but the crop's yield and quality are inferior to lowland rice produced by irrigation methods. Geese flying over a rice field in the Sacramento Valley, California. Rice dryer and storage building in Arkansas County, Arkansas Since then, California has cultivated rice on a large scale, and as of 2006 its production was the second largest state, after Arkansas, with production concentrated in six counties north of Sacramento. During 2012, the estimated rice production was 199 million cwt, or 19.9 billion lbs. This was a rise of 8% over the production of 2011. The harvested area also recorded a rise from 2.68 million ha in 2012 to 2.7 million ha in 2013. Another record was of the yield during 2012 recorded at 7,449 pounds per acre, higher than the 2011 yield by 382 pounds per acre. Six states now account for over 99% of all rice grown in the US. These are Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. As of 2003, Arkansas topped the list with a production level of 213 million bushels against a total production of 443 million bushels in the country, and the annual per capita consumption reported is in excess of 28 pounds. Types of rice Oryza sativa, commonly known as Asian rice The earliest types grown in Carolina were the African Oryza glaberrima, the prized \\"Carolina Gold\\". Asian Oryza sativa was \\"Carolina White\\". After the total decline of rice cultivation in Carolina, \\"Carolina Gold\\" is now cultivated in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana. In California, production is dominated by short and medium-grain japonica varieties, including cultivars developed for the local climate, such as Calrose, which makes up as much as 85% of the state's crop. The broad classification of rice grown includes long-grain rice, medium-grain rice and short-grain rice. While more than 100 varieties of rice are now grown in the world, in the US 20 varieties of rice are commercially produced, primarily in the states of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and California. Primary classifications of rice grown are the long, medium or short-grain type. The long-grain rice is slender and long, the medium-grain rice is plump but not round, and the short-grain rice is round. The forms of rice are brown rice, parboiled rice and regular-milled white rice. Domestically, 58% of rice in the US is used as food, while 16% is used in food and beer processing and 10% is used in pet food. Special varieties of rice, such as jasmine rice and basmati rice which are of the aromatic variety, are imported from Thailand, India, and Pakistan, as such varieties have not been evolved in the US; this demand for import is quite substantial and largely to meet the increasing population of the rice-eating ethnic community. Milling process Harvested rice is subject to milling to remove the husk, which encloses the kernel. Before this process is started, the rice from the field is subject to a cleaning process to remove stalks and any extraneous material by means of special machinery. In the case of parboiled rice, a steam pressure process is adopted for milling. After drying, the rice is subjected to further processing to remove the hull and then polished. Brown rice is processed through a shelling machine which removes the hull. The resulting brown rice retains the bran layer around the kernel. In the case of white rice, the hull and the bran are removed, and the kernels polished. Exports The first export of rice from Carolina was 5 tons in 1698, which rose to 330 tons by 1700 and jumped to 42,000 tons in 1770. Carolina rice was popularized in France by the renowned French chefs Marie Antoine Carême and Auguste Escoffier. However, as a result of the abolition of slave labour, export from Carolina eventually ceased. While the rice production in the US accounts for about 2% of world production, its exports account for about 10% of all exports. The export is mostly of high- quality rice of the long and combined medium/short-grain varieties of rice. The type of rice exported is rough or unmilled rice, parboiled rice, brown rice, and fully milled rice. Exports to Mexico and Central America are mostly of the rough rice variety. Other countries to which the US exports rice include Mexico, Central America, Northeast Asia, the Caribbean, and the Middle East, Canada, the European Union (EU-27), and Sub-Saharan Africa. The exported variety is free of genetically enhanced (GE) rice. The World Trade Organization (WTO) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are the agreements under which the US exports its rice and this has resulted in an increase of exports from the country since the 1990s. Culture \\"Rice Is King\\" parade float at the National Rice Festival in Crowley, Louisiana, (1938) A popular festival observed on New Year's Day, by many Americans (mostly from the southern states) is the preparation and consumption of a rice cuisine called the \\"Hoppin' John\\". Since rice is associated with slave labour as their staple diet (with horse-beans made in to a pulp by boiling; boiled yams and occasionally a small amount of beef or pork) it is eaten in the US on New Year's Day in the belief that it brings good luck since people who \\"eat poor New Year's Day, eat rich the rest of the year.\\" The International Rice Festival is held every year in Crowley, Louisiana, on Friday and Saturday of the third weekend in October. It is the largest and oldest agricultural festival of Louisiana. The festival is a celebration of rice as a staple food and its economic importance in the world. The tradition was set in 1927 as a Rice Carnival by Sal Right, a pioneer of the rice industry. However, the celebration of this festival in Crowley is also attributed to Harry D Wilson, Commissioner of Agriculture. It is also said that the festival was the idea of the Governor to celebrate the festival on the occasion of the silver jubilee of establishment of the city of Crowley on 25 October 1937.

So he appeals to Bangaru Muni (Sathyajith) and he sets off a devastating black magic attack on the legitimate son Mohan (Mohan) and his family. Mohan lives happily with his wife (Jaimala), his two children, his sister Raasi (Pallavi), his brother-in-law Ashok (Veera Pandiyan) and his wife's sister Meena (Roshini). They all move to the palatial house. Mohan is an atheist who doesn't believe in the supernatural or God. Soon, the family is disturbed by a supernatural spirit unleashed by Bangaru Muni, and the spirit is none other than the dead rich illegitimate person described in the movie's introduction. The spirit in Mohan's body kills his wife, his children and his brother-in-law and even Bangaru Muni, as he threatened him to surrender to God. Finally, Jolna Swamy (R. P. Viswam) comes to their rescue and fights against the evil spirit which is in Mohan's body.

Upon his death, and until Roger's arrival from Italy, the bailli of the Principality, Bertrand of Les Baux, laid siege to Patras hoping to reduce it to obedience. In the event, Pope Benedict XII reacted by declaring the city \\"land of the Holy Roman Church\\" and placed the Principality under the interdict.

La Revue musicale of Prunières was undoubtedly the first music publishing magazine giving as much attention to the quality of editing, iconography, and illustration. In each issue (11 per year), there was plenty of information on the musical and choreographic life in many countries. In addition to the magazine, there were over 160 musical pieces by various composers, most of whom were French, irregularly produced as 81 supplements between 1920 and 1939. Many of these were composed specifically for the magazine. Several compositions have been over-looked in listings of the complete works of the composer. The magazine's aim was to support the profound changes taking place in the music of the period while simultaneously showing affection for the music of the past. Avoiding intransigent nationalism that marked French classical music before the World War I, the magazine became a reference point for a segment of European music through the interwar period..

She was launched in 1794 and broken up in 1819. Revolutionary Wars Launched in June 1794, Seahorse was commissioned the following month by Captain John Peyton for the Irish Station. Seahorse took part in Rear Admiral Nelson's attack on Santa Cruz on 25 July 1797. She was with Vice-Admiral Hood's squadron off Alexandria in August 1798. On 2 September, while on patrol in the company of , , , , , and , Seahorse assisted in the destruction of Anemone, a French aviso. Anemone had left Toulon on 27 July and Malta on 26 August. Emerald and Seahorse chased Anemone inshore where she anchored in the shallow water, out of reach of the two British frigates. When the frigates despatched boats, Anemone cut her anchor cable and drifted on to the shore. While the Frenchmen were attempting to escape along the coast, unfriendly Arabs captured them and stripped them of their clothes, shooting those who resisted. The commander and seven others escaped naked to the beach where the British, who had swum ashore with lines and wooden casks, rescued them. A banner bearing the arms of Baron Ferdinand von Hompesch, 71st Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, in 1798 Napoleon's French forces captured Malta on their way to invade Egypt. Seahorse later seized the banner from the French at Malta, about 1797 Anemone had a crew of 60 men under the command of enseigne de vaisseau Garibou,Fonds Marine, p. 210. and was also carrying General Camin and Citoyen Valette, aide de camp to General Napoleon Buonaparte, with dispatches from Toulon, as well as some other passengers. Camin and Valette were among those the Arabs killed. Seahorse arrived at Portsmouth in October 1799, and returned to the Mediterranean in May 1800 as the flagship of Rear- admiral Sir Richard Bickerton.Winfield (2007), p144. On the way, in the evening of 4 April, she encountered the merchantman Washington which was sailing form Lisbon to Philadelphia, and which cleared for action. Both parties were able to identify themselves in time. On 9 September 1801, Seahorse left Portsmouth, escorting a convoy bound for Bengal. The convoy, reached Madeira on 23 September, and left the next day. The convoy consisted of the East Indiamen Northampton, Manship, , , , Sovereign, Caledonia, , , , , Elizabeth, , and .Lloyd's List, no. 4200, - accessed 5 December 2014. Mediterranaean She was paid off for a first time, in October 1802, and was recommissioned in May 1803. She was in action at Lavandon (Hyeres) 11 July 1804. Her next notable action was against the Turkish vessel Badere Zaffere on 6 July 1808. His Majesty authorized the issue of a gold medal to Captain Stewart for the action; only 18 battles or actions qualified for such an award. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issue of the NGSM with clasp \\"Seahorse with Badere Zaffere\\" to all the surviving claimants from the action. On 10 May 1809, a landing party from Seahorse and Halcyon landed on the small Italian islands of Pianosa and Gianuti. The landing party destroyed the enemy forts and captured about 100 prisoners during four hours of fighting. British losses were one marine killed and one wounded.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 22, p.255. On 22 August 1810, while cruising off Tuscany, Seahorse encountered the French brig Renard and the Ligurie. Ligurie escaped immediately but Seahorse was able to drive Renard ashore and cannonade her there. Even so, Renard was little- damaged and was able to get off after Seahorse had left. Renard limped back to Genoa. En route, Renard again met Seahorse, but sought refugee under the shore batteries of Levanto which, although in bad shape, proved sufficient to deter the Seahorse.Jurien de La Gravière, pp.63-4 (603-4 on file) She was paid off for a second time, in June 1811 and was under repair at Woolwich from August to October 1812. She was recommissioned in September 1812 under the command of Sir James Gordon. She sank the 16-gun privateer lugger Subtile off Beachy Head on 13 November 1813 after a chase of three hours. The lugger had been so damaged in the chase that she sank before Seahorse could take off her crew. As a result, of her crew of 72 men, all but 28 drowned, her captain, François- David Drosier, and all his officers, among them. She was a few days out of Dieppe and had captured a Swedish brig laden with salt, and a light collier. was in sight at the time. On 24 March 1814 Seahorse recaptured the Swedish ship Maria Christina while in company with and another warship. War of 1812 Seahorse was off the Atlantic Coast of Northern America in 1814, taking part in an action off the Potomac on 17 August 1814. (John Robyns, Captain of the Royal Marine detachment of HMS Albion, reckoned the Seahorse took £100,000 in prizes.Brooks & Little, p.46. ) In September, she was present at the Battle of Baltimore. In November, Seahorse was at Pensacola until the arrival of General Andrew Jackson's forces caused the British to depart. Her boats were to participate in the Battle of Lake Borgne. Her officers and crew qualified for the clasps to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty issued in 1847 to all surviving claimants, for the former and latter actions. Seahorse stopped off at Prospect Bluff, on the Apalachicola River, to embark 64 Royal Marines. She departed on 15 April 1815, and arrived at Portsmouth on 31 May 1815.

He is the grandson of Van Chann, who mysteriously disappeared in 1969. Davy Chou only discovered in his teens that his grandfather had been one of Cambodia's leading film producers in the 1960s. Davy Chou founded the production company Vycky Films in 2009, with Jean-Jacky Goldberg and Sylvain Decouvelaere. Career =Twin Diamonds and the Golden Reawakening Exhibition= In 2009, Davy Chou created film workshops with six universities and 60 students, and helped to found a youth-driven filmmaking collective, Kon Khmer Koun Khmer (កុនខ្មែរ កូនខ្មែរ, Khmer Films Khmer Generations). He was the producer of a suspense film which was directed by the students, Twin Diamonds. After the suspense film, Davy and Kon Khmer Koun Khmer spearheaded the first film exhibition about films from the 1950s and '60s. Considered as the first 9-day festival of its kind, it screened 11 films from the period and exhibited film posters, photographs as well as biographies of the leading stars of the time at the Chinese House, a restored colonial building near Phnom Penh's port. Davy Chou also found out during his studies and research in Cambodia that between the 1950s and 1960s, more than 400 films were made. =Golden Slumbers= Between 2010 and 2011, he moved to Cambodia in search of surviving witnesses (professionals, spectators, buildings) of the golden age of Cambodian cinema between 1960 and 1975, and found out that nearly 400 films were destroyed or lost under the Khmer Rouge regime. He interviewed actress Dy Saveth and filmmakers Ly Bun Yim, Yvon Hem (who died on August 10, 2012) and Ly You Sreang. The 100 minute documentary resulted from the memories of Cambodian veteran film makers and actresses/actors, and it was called Golden Slumbers (in French Le Sommeil d'Or; in Khmer, ដំណេក មាស, Dâmnek Meas). The documentary was released in theatres in France on September 19, 2012 and on DVD on April 3, 2012 and has been screened in many countries. Golden Slumbers brought back many memories of Cambodia's pre-Khmer Rouge film industry and inspired a youth-driven revival of 1960s and '70s cinephilia. In this film, Davy Chou explored Cambodia's cinematic heritage, and showed the struggle of the country's filmmakers as they weathered political turmoil, followed by critical-mass neglect of their work. Golden Slumbers was selected at many film festivals including Forum Berlinale 2012 and Busan International Film Festival 2011. =Memory Film Festival= In 2013, Davy Chou came back to curate and coordinate Asia's first heritage film festival in Phnom Penh. Chou's participation in the film industry in Cambodia is known for starting interest from a younger Cambodian generation of filmmakers and filmgoers. = Cambodia 2099 = Cambodia 2099 (2014) is a short movie taking place in Phnom Penh on Diamond Island, the country's pinnacle of modernity.

In order from south to north they are as follows. Existing =Sumter connector= =Hartsville business loop= Business U.S. Highway 15 (Bus. US 15) is a business route of U.S. Highway 15 (US 15) in Hartsville, South Carolina that is long. It starts at US 15 outside of Hartsville. It then intersects South Carolina Highway 151 Business in the center of Hartsville and South Carolina Highway 102 in North Hartsville. It then ends at US 15. Major intersections =Laurinburg business loop= Established between 1960-1962 following the original mainline US 15 route through Laurinburg. US 15 Business, in concurrency partly with US 401 Business and US 501 Business, traverses along Main Street and Aberdeen Road. =Durham business loop= Established in 1960 as a renumbering of mainline US 15, along University Drive and Roxboro Street, through downtown Durham. It is in concurrency with US 501 Business for majority of its route and is relatively unchanged since inception. =Keysville business loop= View north along US 15 Bus. and east along US 360 Bus. northeast of SR 622 just south of Keysville U.S. Route 15 Business (US 15 Business) is a business route of US 15 in Charlotte County. The highway, which runs between junctions with US 360 and US 15 south and north of Keysville, is entirely concurrent with US 360 Business. US 15-360 Business follow Old Kings Highway from its southern end through a partial interchange with US 15 and US 360 to the town of Keysville. The business routes enter the town on King Street, along which the highways are concurrent with SR 40. In the center of Keysville, US 15 Business, US 360 Business, and SR 40 curve north then west to cross the Southern Virginia Railroad. Just west of the railroad, the business routes turn north onto Front Street. US 15-360 Business follows Four Locust Highway to rejoin their respective mainline highways at a partial cloverleaf interchange. *Charlotte County (PDF) =Farmville business loop= View south along US 15 Bus. at US 460 Bus. and the south end of SR 45 in Farmville U.S. Route 15 Business in Farmville, Virginia is a former segment of US 15 that begins at the southern end of an overlap at a diamond interchange with US 460. The route follows South Main Street directly into Farmville until the intersection with US Business Route 460 and Virginia State Route 45, and turns west in its own concurrency with US BUS 460. The US 15-460 concurrency ends when US BUS 15 terminates just north of a trumpet interchange at the north end of the mainline US 15-460 overlap, but US BUS 460 turns south an ends directly at that trumpet interchange with US 460. =Farmville alternate loop= Sign for US 15 Alt. along US 15 Bus. and US 460 Bus. in Farmville U.S. Route 15 Alternate in Farmville, Virginia is an alternate route of US 15 Business. The route diverges from US 15 Business at Griffin Boulevard south of downtown Farmville. It follows Griffin Boulevard north to High Street, then turns northwest along Oak Street. It rejoins US 15 Business and US 460 Business just west of downtown Farmville. =Culpeper business loop= View north at the south end of US 15 Bus. at US 15/US 29 near Culpeper Like the business route in Farmville, U.S. Route 15 Business in Culpeper, Virginia is a former segment of US 15 that begins at the southern end of an overlap at a diamond interchange, but in this case, the interchange and overlap is with US 29, and the mainline road turns east. The first leg of US Bus 15 is Orange Road, and despite the fact that Orange Road continues past US 522 to terminate as US Business Route 29, US Bus 15 joins US 522 northwest in an overlap that meets US Bus 29, where Madion Road becomes South Main Street. Along US Bus 15-Bus 29-522, Orange Road terminates between West Park Avenue and West and East Mason Streets. The intersection of Culpeper Street is where one can find Culpeper (Amtrak station) if you turn east and drive two blocks away. US 522 turns left on West Evans Street, while four blocks later, US Bus 15-29 turns east off of North Main Street onto Old James Madison Highway, which eventually becomes Brandy Road and runs parallel to the same Amtrak line that used Culpeper Station before terminating at an interchange with the US 15-29 overlap. Brandy Road becomes Virginia Secondary Route 762. =Remington business loop= View south along US 15 Bus. and US 29 Bus. south of US 15/US 29 just north of Remington U.S. Route 15/29 Business (US 15/29 Bus.) is the former two-lane route of US 15/US 29 (James Madison Highway) through the town of Remington, bypassed in 1975. It begins in Culpeper County where the bypass curves to the north, while US 15/29 Bus. heads northeast on Remington Road to a 1930 pony truss bridge over the Rappahannock River.Bridgehunter.com: Remington Road Bridge (National Bridge Inventory data) Crossing the bridge into Fauquier County, it soon enters Remington, where it is known as James Madison Street. The principal intersection in Remington is with Main Street (State Route 651), which heads west to the bypass and east to Sumerduck. After leaving Remington, US 15/29 Bus. travels north and returns to mainline US 15/29 about south of SR 28. River Road (SR 1202), which intersects US 15/29 Bus. north of the Rappahannock, is the pre-1930 alignment of US 15 (then also SR 32).Remington quadrangle (advance sheet), 1927 The original bridge is long- gone. =Warrenton business loop= View south along US 15 Bus. in Warrenton U.S. Route 15 Business in Warrenton, Virginia is also U.S. Business Route 17 and U.S. Business Route 29, at least at the southern end. After James Madison Highway becomes Shirley Avenue, US Bus 15 leaves this concurrency at Falmouth Street, while US BUS 17-29 continues to the northwest. Two blocks after serving as the western terminus of State Route 643, Falmouth Street intersects Mockingbird Lane and curves west to become Main Street, which runs through the heart of historic Downtown Warrenton. As Main Street terminates at the corner of U.S. Business Route 211(Waterloo Street and Alexandria Pike), US Bus 15 turns north in a concurrency with US BUS 211. US BUS 15-211 follows Alexandria Pike north until they move onto Blackwell Road before encountering at U.S. 211-Bus 29(Lee Highway) where US 211 and US BUS 211 terminates, Blackwell Road becomes State Route 672, and US BUS 15 turns east on BUS 29 before finally terminating at an interchange with the northern end of the US 15-17-29 overlap. =Leesburg business loop= View north at the south end of US 15 Bus. at SR 7 in Leesburg US 15 enters the town of Leesburg from the south as South King Street, and U.S. Route 15 Business (US 15 Bus.) separates from it at SR 7, the Leesburg Bypass. It continues straight into the historic downtown area, crossing the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Trail, the Town Branch creek, Royal Street, and Loudoun Street. US 15 Bus. crosses Market Street, State Route 7 Business, at the center of town, from which the town's four intercardinal sections radiate, and where the Loudoun County courthouse occupies the northeast corner. US 15 Bus. then changes names to North King Street, and proceeds through the last few blocks of the historic district, crossing Cornwall Street and North Street. It continues past Union Cemetery, Ida Lee Park, and several schools. US 15 Bus. rejoins US 15 at the north end of Leesburg, just short of the Morven Park equestrian facilities. =Emmitsburg business loop= View north along US 15 Bus. in Emmitsburg U.S. Route 15 Business (US 15 Business) is a business route of US 15 through Emmitsburg. Known as Seton Avenue, the highway runs between junctions with US 15 on the south and north sides of the town. US 15 Business follows the original alignment of US 15 through Emmitsburg. The highway serves the St. Joseph's College and Mother Seton Shrine campuses, which are home to several emergency management institutions and a shrine dedicated to Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first person born in the United States to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. The U.S. Highway's bypass of the town was constructed between 1963 and 1965. US 15 Business was assigned to the old alignment of US 15 from south of Emmitsburg to the Pennsylvania state line by 1967. The business route became unsigned by 1989 and was truncated at its present northern end by 1999. Signage for US 15 Bus. at MD 140 in Emmittsburg US 15 Business begins at a superstreet intersection with US 15 (Catoctin Mountain Highway) opposite county-maintained Old Frederick Road. Access to northbound US 15 requires following southbound US 15 to a median U-turn. The superstreet intersection replaced a standard highway junction in 2004. US 15 Business heads north as a two-lane road that immediately intersects the old alignment of US 15, Old Emmitsburg Road, and crosses Toms Creek. The business route passes the campuses of St. Joseph's College and the Mother Seton Shrine. St. Joseph's College is a defunct liberal arts college for women whose operations were absorbed by Mount St. Mary's University. The campus is now the National Emergency Training Center, a Federal Emergency Management Agency facility that is home of the National Fire Academy, United States Fire Administration, Emergency Management Institute, and the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial. The Seton Shrine comprises the Basilica of the National Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton and St. Joseph's Provincial House of the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. US 15 Business continues north into the Emmitsburg Historic District, where the highway intersects MD 140 (Main Street) and passes St. Euphemia's School and Sisters' House. The business route veers northeast and crosses Flat Run before approaching its northern terminus at US 15\\\\. Traffic from northbound US 15 Business to northbound US 15 is required to follow the ramp to southbound US 15 and turn around at US 15's interchange with MD 140. US 15 Business continues north to MD 873, an unnamed service road that parallels the southbound direction of US 15 toward the Pennsylvania state line. That intersection is connected to a one-way southbound ramp from US 15's intersection with Welty Road. The intersection was changed to remove access from northbound US 15 Business to northbound US 15 in 2007. East of US 15, Welty Road immediately intersects Old Gettysburg Road, the old alignment of US 15 north towards Gettysburg. =Gettysburg business loop= U.S. Route 15 Business (US 15 Business) is a surface road in Adams County, Pennsylvania that serves as a through street in the Gettysburg area. It marks the original incarnation of US 15, before a freeway bypass was created. The southernmost portion of the business loop is lightly traveled, serving as a rolling connecting route between the more utilized portions of this highway and a similar business loop in Emmitsburg, Maryland. The road's designation officially begins at the Pennsylvania–Maryland state line in Freedom Township. South of Gettysburg National Military Park, the road is narrow and features infrequent development, while at its southern edges, a small number tourist facilities appear. Traffic picks up greatly during peak travel months through the park, which uses this highway as one of two main access ways. At the northern border of the greenspace, the route becomes Gettysburg's main street, featuring many stoplights and often cars parked on both sides of the street. North of the city center near Gettysburg College, large homes line the street. The highway then turns northeast, passing as an overly narrow route past commercial development, before traveling into sparsely populated farm county. In unincorporated Shrivers Corner, the route meets up with Pennsylvania Route 394, with which it is cosigned for its final one-half mile, as it passes into a US 15 freeway juncture. Major intersections =Mansfield business loop= U.S. Route 15 Business (US 15 Business) is a surface road in Tioga County, Pennsylvania that serves as a through street in the Mansfield, Pennsylvania area. It marks the original incarnation of US 15, before a freeway bypass was created. The route begins in the south in an area that features a variety of commercial development, including the area's fast food and big box stores. After passing through a light industrial section, the road moves into the borough of Mansfield. The business loop serves as the area's main north-south street, while U.S. Route 6 is the key east-west street. After leaving the borough, it briefly travels along the forested Tioga River, before meeting a freeway junction. Major intersections Former =Walterboro–Creedmoor alternate route= Established in 1936 as a renumbering of U.S. Route 401, from the South Carolina state line to Creedmoor, going through the cities of Laurinburg, Raeford, Fayetteville, Lillington, and Raleigh. In 1950, South Carolina discontinued the US 15A concurrency with US 15, but was not till 1953 when North Carolina followed and moved US 15A's southern terminus in Laurinburg. In 1957, US 15A was renumbered back to US 401. =Sumter–Society Hill alternate route= =Bennettsville business loop= =Sanford alternate route= Established in 1957 when mainline US 15 was bypassed west of Sanford. US 15A, in concurrency with US 1A and US 501A, traversed on Carthage Street and Hawkins Avenue. In 1960, it was renumbered as US 15 Business. =Sanford business loop= Established in 1960 as a renumbering of US 15A along Carthage Street and Hawkins Avenue, in concurrency with US 1 Business and US 501 Business. Between 1976-1978, US 1 Business was rerouted along NC 42 on Wicker Street; it is believed that both US 15 Business and US 501 Business were decommissioned by that time. =Chapel Hill alternate route= Established in 1953 when mainline US 15 was bypassed around Chapel Hill. US 15A, in concurrency with US 501A, traversed on Columbia Street and Franklin Street.

The uprising, initially demanding democratic reforms, evolved from initially minor protests, beginning as early as January 2011 and transformed into massive protests in March. The uprising was marked by massive anti-government opposition demonstrations against the Ba'athist government led by Bashar al-Assad, meeting with police and military violence, massive arrests and a brutal crackdown, resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of wounded. Despite Bashar al-Assad's attempts to stop the protests with the massive crackdown and use of censorship on one hand and concessions on the other, by the end of April it became clear the situation was getting out of his control and his government deployed numerous troops on the ground. The civil uprising phase led to the emergence of militant opposition movements and massive defections from the Syrian Army, which gradually transformed the conflict from a civil uprising to an armed rebellion, and later a full-scale civil war. The rebel Free Syrian Army was created on 29 July 2011, marking the transition into armed insurgency. Background Before the uprising in Syria began in mid-March 2011, protests were relatively modest, considering the wave of unrest that was spreading across the Arab world. Syria, until March 2011, for decades had remained superficially tranquil, largely due to fear among the people of the secret police arresting critical citizens. Factors contributing to social unrest in Syria include socioeconomic stressors caused by the Iraqi conflict (2003–present), as well as the most intense drought ever recorded in the region. Minor protests calling for government reforms began in January, and continued into March. At this time, massive protests were occurring in Cairo against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and in Syria on 3 February via the websites Facebook and Twitter, a \\"Day of Rage\\" was called for by activists against the government of Bashar al-Assad, to be held on Friday, 4 February. This did not result in protests. Civil uprising (March–July 2011) =March 2011 unrest= Demonstration in Douma, a Damascus suburb, against the Assad government on 8 April 2011. Major unrest began on 15 March in Damascus, yet in the southern city of Daraa, sometimes called the \\"Cradle of the Revolution\\", protests had been triggered on 6 March by the incarceration and torture of 15 young students from prominent families who were arrested for writing anti-government graffiti in the city, reading: \\"\\" – (\\"The people want the fall of the regime\\") – a trademark slogan of the Arab Spring. A 13-year- old boy, Hamza al-Khateeb, was tortured and killed. The government claimed that the boys weren't attacked, and that Qatar incited the majority of the protests. Writer and analyst Louai al-Hussein, referencing the Arab Spring ongoing at that time, wrote that \\"Syria is now on the map of countries in the region with an uprising\\". Demonstrators clashed with local police, and confrontations escalated on 18 March after Friday prayers. Security forces attacked protesters gathered at the Omari Mosque using water cannons and tear gas, followed by live fire, killing four. On 20 March, a mob burned down the Ba'ath Party headquarters and other public buildings. Security forces quickly responded, firing live ammunition at crowds, and attacking the focal points of the demonstrations. The two-day assault resulted in the deaths of seven police officers and fifteen protesters. Meanwhile, minor protests occurred elsewhere in the country. Protesters demanded the release of political prisoners, the abolition of Syria's 48-year emergency law, more freedoms, and an end to pervasive government corruption. The events led to a \\"Friday of Dignity\\" on 18 March, when large-scale protests broke out in several cities, including Banias, Damascus, al-Hasakah, Daraa, Deir az-Zor, and Hama. Police responded to the protests with tear gas, water cannons, and beatings. At least 6 people were killed and many others injured. On 25 March, mass protests spread nationwide, as demonstrators emerged after Friday prayers. At least 20 protesters were reportedly killed by security forces. Protests subsequently spread to other Syrian cities, including Homs, Hama, Baniyas, Jasim, Aleppo, Damascus and Latakia. Over 70 protesters in total were reported killed. =Crackdown= Syrian security forces allegedly open fire on protestors in Jisr ash-Shugur on 5 May 2011. Even before the uprising began, the Syrian government had made numerous arrests of political dissidents and human rights campaigners, many of whom were labeled \\"terrorists\\" by the Assad government. In early February 2011, authorities arrested several activists, including political leaders Ghassan al-Najar, Abbas Abbas, and Adnan Mustafa. Police and security forces responded to the protests violently, using water cannons and tear gas as well as physically beating protesters and firing live ammunition. As the uprising began, the Syrian government waged a campaign of arrests that captured tens of thousands of people, according to lawyers and activists in Syria and human rights groups. In response to the uprising, Syrian law had been changed to allow the police and any of the nation's 18 security forces to detain a suspect for eight days without a warrant. Arrests focused on two groups: political activists, and men and boys from the towns that the Syrian Army would start to besiege in April. Many of those detained experienced ill- treatment. Many detainees were cramped in tight rooms and were given limited resources, and some were beaten, electrically jolted, or debilitated. At least 27 torture centers run by Syrian intelligence agencies were revealed by Human Rights Watch on 3 July 2012. President Assad characterized the opposition as armed terrorist groups with Islamist \\"takfiri\\" extremist motives, portraying himself as the last guarantee for a secular form of government. Early in the month of April, a large deployment of security forces prevented tent encampments in Latakia. Blockades were set up in several cities to prevent the movement of protests. Despite the crackdown, widespread protests continued throughout the month in Daraa, Baniyas, Al-Qamishli, Homs, Douma and Harasta. =Concessions= Pro-government demonstration at Tishreen University, Latakia on 23 May 2011. During March and April, the Syrian government, hoping to alleviate the unrest, offered political reforms and policy changes. Authorities shortened mandatory army conscription, and in an apparent attempt to reduce corruption, fired the governor of Daraa. The government announced it would release political prisoners, cut taxes, raise the salaries of public sector workers, provide more press freedoms, and increase job opportunities. Many of these announced reforms were never implemented. The government, dominated by the Alawite sect, made some concessions to the majority Sunni and some minority populations. Authorities reversed a ban that restricted teachers from wearing the niqab, and closed the country's only casino. The government also granted citizenship to thousands of Syrian Kurds previously labeled \\"foreigners\\". Following Bahrain's example, the Syrian government held a two- day national dialogue in July, in attempt to alleviate the crisis. The dialogue was a chance to discuss the democratic reforms and other issues, however many of the opposition leaders and protest leaders refused to attend citing that continuing crackdown on protesters in streets. A popular demand from protesters was an end of the nation's state of emergency, which had been in effect for nearly 50 years. The emergency law had been used to justify arbitrary arrests and detention, and to ban political opposition. After weeks of debate, Assad signed the decree on 21 April, lifting Syria's state of emergency. However, anti-government protests continued into April, with activists unsatisfied with what they considered vague promises of reform from Assad. Further reforms During the course of the civil war, there have been some political changes towards the electoral process and the constitution. =Military operations= April 2011 Opposition demonstration in Baniyas on 29 April 2011. As the unrest continued, the Syrian government began launching major military operations to suppress resistance, signaling a new phase in the uprising. On 25 April, Daraa, which had become a focal point of the uprising, was one of the first cities to be besieged by the Syrian Army. An estimated hundreds to 6,000 soldiers were deployed, firing live ammunition at demonstrators and searching house to house for protesters, slaughtering hundreds. Tanks were used for the first time against demonstrators, and snipers took positions on the rooftops of mosques. Mosques used as headquarters for demonstrators and organizers were especially targeted. Security forces began shutting off water, power and phone lines, and confiscating flour and food. Clashes between the army and opposition forces, which included armed protesters and defected soldiers, led to the death of hundreds. By 5 May, most of the protests had been suppressed, and the military began pulling out of Daraa, with some troops remaining to keep the situation under control. May 2011 During the crackdown in Daraa, the Syrian Army also besieged and blockaded several towns around Damascus. Throughout May, situations similar to those that occurred in Daraa were reported in other besieged towns and cities, such as Baniyas, Homs, Talkalakh, Latakia, and several other towns. After the end of each siege, violent suppression of sporadic protests continued throughout the following months. By 24 May, the names of 1,062 people killed in the uprising since mid-March had been documented by the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria. June–July 2011 Hundreds of thousands of protesters parade the flag of Syria and shout \\"Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam\\" in the Assi square of Hama on 22 July 2011 As the uprising progressed, opposition fighters became better equipped and more organized. Until September 2011, about two senior military or security officers defected to the opposition. Some analysts stated that these defections were signs of Assad's weakening inner circle. The first instance of armed insurrection occurred on 4 June 2011 in Jisr ash-Shugur, a city near the Turkish border in Idlib province. Angry protesters set fire to a building where security forces had fired on a funeral demonstration. Eight security officers died in the fire as demonstrators took control of a police station, seizing weapons. Clashes between protesters and security forces continued in the following days. Some security officers defected after secret police and intelligence agents executed soldiers who refused to kill the civilians. On 6 June, Sunni militiamen and army defectors ambushed a group of security forces heading to the city which was met by a large government counterattack. Fearing a massacre, insurgents and defectors, along with 10,000 residents, fled across the Turkish border. In June and July 2011, protests continued as government forces expanded operations, repeatedly firing at protesters, employing tanks against demonstrations, and conducting arrests. The towns of Rastan and Talbiseh, and Maarat al-Numaan were besieged in early June. On 30 June, large protests erupted against the Assad government in Aleppo, Syria's largest city. On 3 July, Syrian tanks were deployed to Hama, two days after the city witnessed the largest demonstration against Bashar al- Assad. During the first six months of the uprising, the inhabitants of Syria's two largest cities, Damascus and Aleppo, remained largely uninvolved in the anti-government protests. The two cities' central squares have seen organized rallies of hundreds of thousands in support of president Assad and his government. Aftermath On 29 July, a group of defected officers announced the formation of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). Composed of defected Syrian Armed Forces personnel, the rebel army seeks to remove Bashar al-Assad and his government from power. On 23 August, the Syrian National Council was formed as a political counterpart to the FSA.  Media coverage  Reporting on this conflict was difficult and dangerous from the start: journalists were being attacked, detained, reportedly tortured and killed. Technical facilities (internet, telephone etc.) were being sabotaged by the Syrian government. Both sides in this conflict tried to disqualify their opponent by framing or referring to them with negative labels and terms, or by presenting false evidence.

It is now home to Legacy Christian Academy, Athletes in Action, and other Christian ministries. Early history Money was collected from taxes levied during the Civil War to care for the dependents of soldiers, but the government mishandled the money. By the war's end, several families were living in county infirmities under deplorable conditions. Seeing this, soldiers still living began contacting government officials, requesting that something be done to help the families of the fallen soldiers. Eventually, the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), a federation the veterans formed after the close of the Civil War to foster comradeship, financed the purchase of a home for veteran's orphans in the city of Xenia. Xenia was chosen because people from Greene County had long been interested in the plight of the veterans' families, and Reverend P.C. Prugh had been raising funds for the project for some time. Rev. Prugh is thus referred to as the \\"Father\\" of the movement to establish a home. Additionally, Chaplain George W. Collier is credited with being the first to suggest the idea of a home to the GAR.http://greenelibrary.info/research/ohio-soldiers- sailors-orphans-home/ In 1869, the Grand Army of the Republic established the Ohio Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans' Home in Xenia, Ohio. The \\"Home\\" was commissioned by Abraham Lincoln, and was a self-contained community with a farm, dairy barn, hospital, power/heating plant, gymnasium, banquet hall, chapel, and residence halls. Lincoln challenged the states to bind up the wounds of the Civil War by meeting the needs of widows and orphans created by the conflict. Ohio members of the Grand Army of the Republic took up that challenge, and, through a donation of 100 acres by a Xenia farmer, created the Ohio Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans' Home. This institution was the predecessor of the Ohio Veterans' Children's Home. In 1870, the State of Ohio assumed control of the home. The Ohio Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans' Home was originally located in a rented building in Xenia, Ohio. In 1869, Xenia residents provided the GAR with 150 acres of land to build a permanent facility.http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Ohio_Veterans'_Children's_Home \\"Home Life\\" The home conducted church services, established a regular school curriculum as well as education in several trades, started a library, and supplied on-site medical attention. The list of trades is impressive, including tin smithing; wood carving; knitting; dress making; tailoring; farm, florist, and garden work; butchering and slaughtering; telegraphy, and blacksmithing. The children also enjoyed such extra-curricular activities as choir, orchestra, concert band, military band, drum corps, and athletics. Beginning in April 1876, the home put out their own paper, titled the Home Weekly. Children were discharged from the home at the age of 16.http://greenelibrary.info/research/ohio-soldiers-sailors-orphans-home/ Athletics Athletic teams at Woodrow Wilson High School competed as the \\"Cadets\\".

It is so called because it was built by Baron Haussmann to connect the Place du Châtelet with the Gare de l'Est, whence trains to Strasbourg depart. The creation of the Boulevard de Strasbourg was one of the streets envisaged in conjunction with the new train stations.

The reform had a confiscatory character. It began on January 22, 1991. Its architect was Minister of Finance Valentin Pavlov, who was to become the last prime minister of the Soviet Union. Overview 22 January 1991 President of the USSR Mikhail Gorbachev signed a decree on withdrawal from circulation and retirement of the 50- and 100-ruble banknotes of then-current 1961 issue. The signing of the Decree was reported on television at 21:00 pm Moscow time same day. By that time, virtually all financial institutions and shops were closed for the day. People who learned of the news rushed to exchange their affected notes through institutions that were open late and potentially unaware, such as transit stations and taxis. Some were able to send large remittances at late-open post offices, at railway stations, working 24 hours to relatives or to themselves. Some managed to purchase advance rail and air tickets and pay with affected notes with an intention to return them for refund in valid notes. The reform included provision for the 50 and 100-ruble banknotes of 1961 standard to be redeemable for exchange in limited quantities per person or family through workplace- organized exchange locations to smaller-denomination banknotes or to new-issue (1991) bills of 50 and 100 rubles denomination. The exchange was a subject to significant limitations: *Deadlines for exchange – for three days from 23 to 25 January (Wednesday to Friday). *No more than 1,000 rubles per person − additional exchange was to be requested as an exception for consideration by a special commissions till the end of March 1991. However, actual exchange was also limited by the amount of cash available to exchange locations. Withdrawal at the Savings Bank of the USSR — the only consumer bank — was also limited to no more than 500 rubles per month per depositor. In reality, deposits in several savings banks, including those in different cities, were allowed and common. As there was no technical way to link different accounts, an ad hoc decision was made to make notes of withdrawals on the last pages of passport, where bank's officers made a mark of the amounts withdrawn from the deposit. Results Government plans succeeded only in part, and had tremendous negative effect: confiscatory procedure allowed to withdraw from circulation 14 billion rubles in cash, but the surprise reform, which intended to help in the fight against speculation, unearned income, counterfeiting, smuggling and corruption, resulted in a loss of public confidence in the government's actions. Unpopular shock therapy reforms in the Soviet Union under the leadership of Pavlov continued. On April 2, just as suddenly, consumer prices (then controlled by government) increased about 3-fold. The reform was unable to prevent the collapse of the economy and the eventual political collapse of the Soviet Union.

At first a strong supporter of Charles de Gaulle and his Free French, he later fell out with de Gaulle too. He spent the last years of his life in voluntary exile in the United States. Early career Henri de Kérillis was born on 27 October 1889 at Vertheuil, Gironde. His parents were rear-Admiral Henri Calloc'h de Kérillis (1856–1940) and Louise Antoinette d'Elbauve (1864–1931). His family background was military, and he was expected to also follow a military career. He graduated from the cavalry school at Saumur as a second-lieutenant. On 29 June 1914 he married Anne Demaison (1891-1954). They had two children. In World War I de Kérillis was at first a cavalry lieutenant. He participated in the raid of the Gironde Squadron behind enemy lines in Belgium on 10 September 1914. He was wounded, and was made a knight of the Legion of Honor. He joined the air force, where he was known for his bravery. In June 1916 he led a reprisal raid on Karlsruhe killing 117 defenseless people, including 30 men, 5 women and 82 children. He flew 256 missions, was cited six times and made an officer of the Legion of Honor. He suffered a serious injury, requiring trepanning. He then joined the Under-Secretary of State for Aeronautics, where he was responsible for monitoring the bomber fleet. Farman F-68BN4 Goliath 1919 When the war ended, de Kérillis resigned from the army. Until 1926 he was a director of the Farman Aviation Works. For this company he visited England and America, and spent six months in Cuba installing the first aerodrome there. He participated in a mission led by Gaston Gradis to cross the Sahara from Colomb-Béchar in Algeria to Savé in Dahomey (now Benin) between 15 November and 3 December 1924. He recorded the experience in his first book, De l'Algérie au Dahomey en automobile (1925). De Kérillis began working for l'Écho de Paris, first as a reporter of major stories, then as chief of domestic politics. He continued to travel widely and to meet leading political figures in the countries he visited. He recorded his experiences and views in Du Pacifique à la mer Morte (From the Pacific to the Dead Sea), Faisons le point (Taking Stock) and L'Italie nouvelle (The New Italy). He published his political views in the Echo de Paris and then in the Epoque. In 1925 he was in Syria, reporting for l'Écho de Paris during the Great Syrian Revolt. He blamed the events on the high commissioner, General Maurice Sarrail, who he said had ignored warnings of trouble. Political views De Kérillis had right-wing, conservative and nationalist political views. He was early to point out the danger of German aggression and the need to resist. As early as April 1920, in an article in l'Écho de Paris he pointed out the danger of German civil aviation, which had not been mentioned in the Treaty of Versailles but could easily be converted for use in transport and bombing. De Kérillis was not opposed to fascist regimes in Italy and Spain. During the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (October 1935 to May 1936), de Kérillis strongly opposed Édouard Herriot, who supported the Ethiopians and had pro-Communist views. He published vicious attacks on Herriot in l'Echo de Paris throughout the crisis. He saw racism as the new ideology of totalitarian regimes, and called it \\"le ciment des dictatures\\" in a November 1938 article in l'Époque. However, he supported Benito Mussolini, noting that his Fascism did not discriminate on the basis of race or religion, as Nazism did and that many Jews had joined the party. During the Spanish Civil War (July 1936 to April 1939), he considered that France should have helped General Franco to prevent him from having to become aligned with Germany and Italy. Candidate and deputy Paul Reynaud, whom de Kérillis sometimes supported, sometimes opposed In 1926 de Kérillis was on the list headed by Paul Reynaud in a by-election in the 2nd sector of Paris. After a vigorous campaign, Raynaud and de Kérillis were beaten in the second round by a list headed by the communist Jacques Duclos. Seeing the poor organization of the national parties, he founded a \\"Center of National Republican propaganda\\" which provided opinion pieces in journals, helped candidates with leaflets, posters and films, and organized committees and speakers. The Center aimed to pull together conservatives into a united party supporting André Tardieu. In this he was opposed by Victor Perret, who felt this was a distraction from the Republican Federation. In 1932 de Kérillis tried for election in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, but was defeated. He finally won election to parliament in the elections of 26 April 1936. In parliament, de Kérillis was an independent Republican. He was a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. He opposed the cabinets of Léon Blum and Camille Chautemps, supported that of Édouard Daladier and opposed that of Paul Reynaud. He opposed the 40-hour week law and the law for resolution of labor disputes, and voted for paid leave. His main activity was in foreign affairs, where he was against the pacifist policy of the left-wing Popular Front, and expressed concern about France's military weakness. De Kérillis was the only conservative deputy to vote against the Munich Agreement. He described the agreement as shameful. He said that Germany was insatiable, respected only the strong and would show no pity to the weak, which France had shown herself to be. He said that far from becoming peaceful, Germany would become more demanding and terrible. In January 1939 he again spoke on foreign policy, saying that each time France abandoned an ally, she became weaker and less secure. He alternated between opposing an alliance with Russia, which he saw as interfering in French politics through the Communist party, and supporting an eastern alliance. By 1940 he was in favor of a broad coalition of states in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, including the USSR, to preserve the peace. In a January 1940 debate, he opposed expelling communists from parliament, calling those who supported the measure defeatist and pro-German. Exile Charles de Gaulle in Tunisia, 1943 When Reynaud's cabinet fell on 16 June 1940, de Kérillis flew in a small plane piloted by his brother Hervé from Bordeaux to Jersey, from where the English took them to Exeter on 15 June 1940. De Kérillis met General Charles de Gaulle in London before going on to New York. He reached the United States in mid-July. He was not present in Vichy on 10 July 1940 when Marshal Philippe Pétain was voted full powers. De Kérillis was expelled from the Legion of Honor and his property was confiscated. He was deprived of French nationality in the summer of 1940, and was sentenced to death in absentia. His son Alain was arrested. De Kérillis never saw him again. Geneviève Tabouis, a friend of the Roosevelts and passionate anti-Nazi, created a weekly journal Pour la victoire (For Victory) that first appeared in January 1942. De Kérillis wrote the main editorials for the journal. De Kérillis persuaded prominent writers to contribute to the journal, including Jacques Maritain, Ève Curie, Claude Lévi-Strauss, André Breton, Henri Peyre, Julien Green and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. At first he was a strong supporter of de Gaulle in the United States and Canada. In September 1942 de Kérillis published Français, voici la vérité (French people, here is the truth) in which he criticized the government of Marshal Petain and praised General Charles de Gaulle. In September 1942 he signed a letter sent to General Charles de Gaulle by five members of the French parliament. The other signatories were Édouard Jonas, Hervé de Lyrot, Pierre Mendès France and Pierre Cot. De Kérillis sympathized with de Gaulle's difficulty, saying in a letter to him, Henri Giraud (left) and Charles de Gaulle sit down after shaking hands in presence of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill at the Casablanca Conference on 14 January 1943, in an insincere public display of unity. By 1943 de Kérillis had become hostile to de Gaulle. The turning point came when de Gaulle began to assume total control of the Free French movement, both military and political, starting with his attacks on General Henri Giraud in North Africa. His hostility deepened when de Gaulle brought communists into the government in exile, since de Kérillis considered that the communists had betrayed France by supporting the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. He was among the prominent refugees from France who created friction between de Gaulle and Franklin D. Roosevelt. De Kérillis left Pour la victoire in December 1944. In October 1945 he published a work called De Gaulle dictateur. In it he accused de Gaulle of having lost sight of his first objective of liberating France in favor of his personal political ambitions. He said that de Gaulle's entourage included former \\"Cagoulards\\", extreme right wing terrorists who had tried to destabilize the 3rd Republic in the 1930s. He described André Dewavrin (\\"Colonel Passy\\") as de Gaulle's \\"evil genius\\", describing him as the \\"all powerful head of the Gaullist Gestapo.\\" De Kérillis chose voluntary exile in the United States after the war rather than return to a France \\"humiliated and enslaved by her new masters.\\" He died on 11 April 1958 at his farm on Long Island, New York.

It is striking because of the conspicuous spike of pink or purple terminal bracts which includes the flowers.  Description  The upright stems of this species, which may branch, are terminated by a spike of pink to purple bracts amongst which the tubular flowers appear. Younger, lower bracts are green however, as the pink/purple colour appears and deepens only with time. The plant grows up to 40 or 60 cm high. The ordinary leaves are lanceolate and opposite and may have short teeth. The bracts are also lanceolate and have long teeth up to 8 mm. The flowers are two-lipped with a closed throat and are 2 – 2.5 cm long. They are pink to purple with a yellow or white patch.  Distribution, season, ecology  This European plant flowers from June to September. It is favoured by a dry habitat and chalky soil. It is distributed throughout Western Europe except in central & southern Spain, southern Italy, Ireland, Iceland, Norway, central and northern Sweden, and northern Finland. Also its range extends east to the Ural Mountains and it is found in Turkey. In Great Britain it only occurs in a few locations in south-east England. It is becoming rarer, at least in Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland; this may be due to a reduced area of arable land and changes in farming practices, such as seed-cleaning and intensification. This species is hemiparasitic, commonly on the roots of grasses but also on those of other plants. It cannot flourish without a host from which to take nutrients. In an experiment where the growth of M. arvense was compared on rye grass, alfalfa and flax, it was found to grow much the best on the leguminous plant, alfalfa. The flowers are pollinated by bumblebees. The seeds may be dispersed by ants which are attracted by a small oil body attached to each seed and which carry them to their nests for food. Like some other species of Melampyrum, on their undersides the bracts have minute nectar-producing glands which attract ants, bumblebees and other insects. These glands are violet in the case of M. arvense, are visible under a hand lens, and take the form of minute scales (about 0.45mm in diameter) which secrete a sugary solution.  Human impact  Field cow-wheat is an annual weed of arable fields as well as a component of some natural grassy meadow ecosystems. The seeds are poisonous because they hold aucubin. The plant is being targeted by some groups for conservation projects and policy. As with Yellow Rattle (Rhinanthus species), it is sometimes considered to be a valuable part of restoration projects by reducing the vigor, and cover, of grasses and legumes. This enables more forbs (wildflowers) to colonize the land, increasing diversity as well as the land's nectar and pollen production. It is also considered to have aesthetic value.

When the militia, led by the Roman Praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber, besieged the group of escaped slaves on Mount Vesuvius, Spartacus's men adopted unusual tactics, rapelling down the steeper cliff face opposite the Roman forces, flanking and defeating them.  Background  = Capuan Revolt = In the Roman Republic of the 1st century, gladiatorial games were one of the more popular forms of entertainment. In order to supply gladiators for the contests, several training schools, or ludi, were established throughout Italy.Smith, Greek and Roman Antiquities, \\"Gladiatores\\", p. 574. In these schools, prisoners of war and condemned criminals—who were considered slaves—were taught the skills required to fight to the death in gladiatorial games.Mommsen, The History of Rome, 3233–3238. In 73 BC, a group of some 200 gladiators in the Capuan school owned by Lentulus Batiatus plotted an escape. When their plot was betrayed, a force of about 70 men seized kitchen implements, (\\"choppers and spits\\"), fought their way free from the school, and seized several wagons of gladiatorial weapons and armor.Plutarch, Crassus, 8:1–2; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Livy, Periochae, 95:2; Florus, Epitome, 2.8. Plutarch claims 78 escaped, Livy claims 74, Appian \\"about seventy\\", and Florus says \\"thirty or rather more men\\". \\"Choppers and spits\\" is from Life of Crassus. Once free, the escaped gladiators chose leaders from their number, selecting two Gallic slaves—Crixus and Oenomaus—and Spartacus, who was said either to be a Thracian auxiliary from the Roman legions later condemned to slavery, or a captive taken by the legions.Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Plutarch, Crassus, 8:2. Note: Spartacus' status as an auxilia is taken from the Loeb edition of Appian translated by Horace White, which states \\"...who had once served as a soldier with the Romans...\\". However, the translation by John Carter in the Penguin Classics version reads: \\"...who had once fought against the Romans and after being taken prisoner and sold...\\". There is some question as to Spartacus's nationality, however, as a Thraex (plural Thraces or Threses) was a type of gladiator in Rome, the title \\"Thracian\\" may simply refer to the style of gladiatorial combat in which he was trained.Smith, Greek and Roman Antiquities, \\"Gladiatores\\", p. 576. These escaped slaves were able to defeat a small force of troops sent after them from Capua, and equip themselves with captured military equipment as well as their gladiatorial weapons.Plutarch, Crassus, 9:1. Sources are somewhat contradictory on the order of events immediately following the escape, but they generally agree that this band of escaped gladiators plundered the region surrounding Capua, recruited many other slaves into their ranks, and eventually retired to a more defensible position on Mount Vesuvius.Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Florus, Epitome, 2.8; - Florus and Appian make the claim that the slaves withdrew to Vesuvius, while Plutarch only mentions \\"a hill\\" in the account of Glaber's siege of the slave's encampment.  Battle  The initial movements of Roman and Slave forces from the Capuan revolt up to and including the winter of 73–72 BC. As the revolt and raids were occurring in Campania—which was a vacation region of the rich and influential in Rome, and the location of many estates—the revolt quickly came to the attention of Roman authorities. They initially viewed the revolt as more a major crime wave than an armed rebellion. However, later that year, Rome dispatched military force under praetorian authority to put down the rebellion.Note: while there seems to be consensus as to the general history of the praetorian expeditions, the names of the commanders and subordinates of these forces varies widely based on the historical account. A Roman praetor, Gaius Claudius Glaber, gathered a force of 3,000 men, not as legions, but as a militia \\"picked up in haste and at random, for the Romans did not consider this a war yet, but a raid, something like an attack of robbery.\\"Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116. Glaber's forces besieged the slaves on Mount Vesuvius, blocking the only known way down the mountain. With the slaves thus contained, Glaber was content to wait until starvation forced the slaves to surrender. While the slaves lacked military training, Spartacus' forces displayed ingenuity in their use of available local materials, and in their use of clever, unorthodox tactics when facing the disciplined Roman armies.Frontinus, Stratagems, Book I, 5:20–22 and Book VII:6. In response to Glaber's siege, Spartacus' men made ropes and ladders from vines and trees growing on the slopes of Vesuvius and used them to rappel down the cliffs on the side of the mountain opposite Glaber's forces. They moved around the base of Vesuvius, outflanked the army, and annihilated Glaber's men.Plutarch, Crassus, 9:1–3; Frontinus, Stratagems, Book I, 5:20–22; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Broughton, Magistrates of the Roman Republic, p. 109. Note: Plutarch and Frontinus write of expeditions under the command of \\"Clodius the praetor\\" and \\"Publius Varinus\\", while Appian writes of \\"Varinius Glaber\\" and \\"Publius Valerius\\". = Aftermath = A second expedition, under the praetor Publius Varinius, was then dispatched against Spartacus. For some reason, Varinius seems to have split his forces under the command of his subordinates Furius and Cossinius. Plutarch mentions that Furius commanded some 2,000 men, but neither the strength of the remaining forces, nor whether the expedition was composed of militia or legions, appears to be known. These forces were also defeated by the army of escaped slaves: Cossinius was killed, Varinius was nearly captured, and the equipment of the armies was seized by the slaves.Plutarch, Crassus, 9:4–5; Livy, Periochae , 95; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Sallust, Histories, 3:64–67. With these successes, more and more slaves flocked to the Spartacan forces, as did \\"many of the herdsmen and shepherds of the region\\", swelling their ranks to some 70,000.Plutarch, Crassus, 9:3; Appian, Civil War, 1:116. Livy identifies the second commander as \\"Publius Varenus\\" with the subordinate \\"Claudius Pulcher\\". The rebel slaves spent the winter of 73–72 BC training, arming and equipping their new recruits, and expanding their raiding territory to include the towns of Nola, Nuceria, Thurii and Metapontum.Florus, Epitome, 2.8. The victories of the rebel slaves did not come without a cost. At some time during these events, one of their leaders, Oenomaus, was lost—presumably in battle—and is not mentioned further in the histories.Orosius, Histories 5.24.2; Bradley, Slavery and Rebellion, p.96.

He is considered a pioneer in the realm of interdisciplinary art. Life and work Igor Sacharow-Ross was born in the Russian Far East and, as a member of the nonconformist art scene, was subject to political persecution in the 1970s. He staged the first actions and performances in the former USSR in 1975, ultimately leading to his deportation in 1978. His early engagement with the concept of nature was prompted by his growing up in the Siberian taiga. He conceives of nature as a field of both destructive and beneficent primeval forces. In the 1980s, Sacharow-Ross began working with molecular structures, such as cancer cells and leaf forms. The artist already at that point sought to combine natural science with considerations from the humanities. The projects of the 1980s, mediators between art and science, are research projects, which unfold in space installations. Since the nineties his project expanded constantly in terms of space as well as content. Against the background of the syntopic thought (defined by Ernst Pöppel) he develops artistic forms of expression for an intermedia communication on the interface of aesthetic and common thinking and acting. Evolving from this the »Raumcollage« (spatial collage) originated as a form in which the artist takes great pains to provoke an interaction between the artistic space and the surroundings.  Style  The oeuvre of Igor Sacharow-Ross, grown over the last 40 years, defies common classifications. In a retrospective portrayal, one discovers the specific quality of his work, having never committed himself to a certain style or medium. Drawings, photographs, paintings, sculpture as well as print, videos, installations and resonance bodies are thus equally used by him and condensed in spatial collages. However, with all divergency of styles and means there are constant aspects in the artistic work. In general it is about determining the coordinates of humanity, or how Igor Sacharow-Ross himself calls it: it is about developing »batteries of empathy«. In a great number of experimental series spectators are confronted with questions like »Who are we as human beings actually? On which lines of life are we situated?« For decades he is continuously considering the open wounds of the history that is called Europe: the day-to-day violence and torture, the misery of refugees, of the banished and the expelled as well as the destruction of the environment. All these historical motions and flight movements are condensed and symbolically transformed in his work. The effort to trigger »processes of reconstruction in man’s memory« is an essential momentum of his occupation with the entanglements of the all-European history. A further constant quality of his artistic work is the concept of syntopia, that aims at a participation of the audience. Igor Sacharow-Ross pursues the interdisclipinary connection of the arts and sciences on the one hand and of society and politics on the other hand by means of exhibitions and events, which always have the spectators as social agents in their center. They are the ones to establish new inter-connections, for example during the project »Sapiens/Sapiens« (Palais de Nations, Geneva and Simultanhalle of Museum Ludwig, Cologne, 2000ff.) as well as with the Syntopia-sculpture »Der Zaun« (The fence) in the context of the Bundesgartenschau, Potsdam (2001). Existential experiences of being-in-danger and pain are always inscribed into these works of art, as for example in the exhibition of »Trauma Natalis« in the National Centre for Contemporary Arts, Moscow (2005).

The museum is located in the Highland village of Gairloch, in Achtercairn. The museum was set up in 1977 by the Gairloch Parish Branch of the Ross & Cromarty Heritage Society. This would later become the Gairloch & District Heritage Society and then the Gairloch & District Heritage Company Ltd. The former Gairloch Heritage Museum from the A832 They applied and were successful in converting part of the existing farm steading in Achtercairn to form a heritage museum and clubs rooms for members during the winter months for lectures, films etc. The year later they applied and were successful in converting the second wing of farm steading to extend the museum as the current building was too small to house the exhibits. The library extension was added in 1987 and an extension for the Rudha Reidh lighthouse lens in 1988. The museum was created due to concern of possible damage to the growing collection of artefacts that had been donated by local people such as the Pictish Stone and thus they investigated means to protect it. The Company wanted to provide a wet weather facility for tourists for them to appreciate aspects of Gairloch’s past. Members of the Company were interested in displaying objects relating to archaeology, farming, fishing, and domestic utensils etc, those that showed the history of the West Coast. In 2017 the board of Gairloch Heritage Museum announced that they obtained a grant from Heritage Lottery Fund to transform a nearby nuclear bunker into a new museum for Gairloch. The museum board and volunteers raised £2.4 million to complete the project. The newly rebranded Gairloch Museum was officially opened on 9 July 2019 by the Princess Royal. The museum is housed in the former Gairloch Roads Depot, which was previously built as an anti-aircraft operations room during the Cold War. The building also served as an Emergency Operations Room in the 1980s and the museum incorporates features of that period, including the heavy blast doors. In October 2020, Gairloch Heritage Museum was named one of the five winners of the 2020 ArtFund Museum of the Year Award. ArtFund increased the prize money to £200,000 and changed the format of the award to five winners in response to the challenges faced by the museum sector during the Coronavirus Pandemic.  Features  The museum contains various displays and exhibitions which focus on the culture and social history of Gairloch parish. Displays include: * The Poolewe Hoard - a rare Early Iron Age bronze hoard found in Poolewe * The original Hyperradiant Fresnel lens from nearby Rua Reidh Lighthouse * A Replica croft house from over 100 years ago * An ancient Pictish stone - the first and one of very few found on the West Coast of Scotland A photograph of the ancient Pictish Stone found at the Museum * Interactive displays on the natural history of the area.

Biography Río de la Plata Paraná River Spanish sources indicate that Diego García was born in Moguer in 1484 (or 1496), but there are Portuguese sources say he was born in Lisbon. However, his first expedition, in 1515, was with Juan Díaz de Solís in search of an oceanic passage leading to the Far East, returning to Spain after the death of Díaz de Solís in the Río de la Plata basin in 1516. He participated in the expedition of Ferdinand Magellan and Juan Sebastián Elcano between 1519 and 1522. García received approval for a new voyage. According to his own account, Diego García set sail on 15 January 1526, but historians have doubted the accuracy of this date, and are more inclined to accept 15 August 1527 (suggested by chronicler Herrera) as the actual departure date.J.T. Medina (1908) Los viajes de Diego García de Moguer al Rio de la Plata, p.87, p.94 reviews the date controversy, and concludes in favor of August 15, 1527.. Diego García sailed from La Coruña, Cape Finisterre, in command of an expedition with three ships. The voyage was financed by merchants to find a suitable spice route, intended to follow Elcano's route and passing through the Magellan Strait. After voyaging through the Atlantic Ocean, García arrived on the south coast of Brazil. In February 1528, he explored the area around the Río de la Plata, an excursion documented in José Toribio Medina's Los viajes de Diego García de Moguer (The travels of Diego García de Moguer). As he navigated through the Paraná River in early 1528, he met men from the Sebastian Cabot group. He was informed that Cabot was at the fort of Sancti Spiritu located at the confluence of the Paraná River in Carcaña. With a ship and a barquentine, García navigated the Paraná River, arriving at the Sancti Spiritu fort. He was surprised and indignant to find Cabot there. He ordered Captain Caro to abandon the place as he, García, alone had been charged by Spain to explore the region. However, after it was explained that Cabot was also in the service of Spain, they joined forces. García continued upstream between what are now the towns of Goya and Bella Vista where he met Cabot who forced him to cooperate in trying to find the legendary Sierra de la Plata. Together they explored the Pilcomayo River and then followed it as far as the strait. Garcia and Cabot continued their attempts to explore the mythical kingdom about which they had heard from Captain Francisco Cesar, hearing that the place was rich in gold, silver, and sheep (llamas) with which fabrics were made. It was the Inca Empire of the legendary City of the Caesars in Chile. Arguments between García and Cabot eventually ended both expeditions, the two men returning to Spain to settle their disputes through legal measures. The dispute arose as García claimed full control of the area he had explored. In the court case which was held in Spain the verdict went in favour of García. The reason was that Cabot who was assigned to go to the Spice Islands never went there but explored the Sierra de la Plata which was a violation. As a punishment he was exiled for two years to Oran. As a result of all the feuding between García and Cabot, the Spaniards failed to ensure the defense of the fort at Sancti Spiritus, which was attacked by the natives in September 1529 while Cabot and García were in San Salvador. In late September or early October 1529, García's caravel traveled to the Ducks Bay (in southern Brazil), picked up Francisco García (who belonged to Cabot's expedition) and traveled to Spain, arriving there on 28 July 1530. Cabot abandoned a planned expedition to the Spice Islands. Instead, on 21 May 1534, Diego García de Moguer sailed his caravel Concepción back to Río de la Plata. He passed the Cape Verde island of Santiago, then continued to Brazil and on to the estuary of the Uruguay and Paraná rivers. He discovered the island of Diego Garcia in the 16th century, then in the service of Portugal.

He influenced his nephew Louis Brandeis, who admired him greatly, to choose law as a profession. Born into a Jewish family in Zirke, in the Prussian province of Posen, he attended gymnasium in Frankfurt, Sagan, and Glogau. After one semester at the Charles University in Prague studying law, he emigrated to the United States in 1849. He continued to study American law in offices at Cincinnati, Ohio, and Madison, Indiana. After doing journalistic work for a time, he began in 1853 to practice law in Louisville, Kentucky, where he remained for the rest of his career. Politically active, Dembitz was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention, assistant city attorney of Louisville, 1884–1888, and was a commissioner for Kentucky to the Conference for the Uniformity of State Laws. In 1888, Dembitz drafted the first Australian ballot law ever adopted in the United States, to govern elections in Louisville. His legal works include: Kentucky Jurisprudence, 1890; Law Language for Shorthand Writers, 1892; and Land Titles in the United States, 2 vols., 1895. He is the author of \\"The Question of Silver Coinage,\\" in the Present Problem Series, 1896, No. 1; and has written a number of book- reviews for The Nation, 1888–97, besides articles in other magazines and in newspapers. Dembitz was strongly attached to conservative Judaism. He was one of the early members of the executive board of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, and in 1878 a member of the commission on the plan of study for the Hebrew Union College. In 1898 he acted as chairman at a convention of Orthodox congregations, and was elected a vice-president of the Orthodox Jewish Congregational Union of America. In addition to memoirs, articles, and addresses which have appeared in Jewish papers, he published Jewish Services in Synagogue and Home, 1898; \\"The Lost Tribes,\\" in the Andover Review, August 1889; and revised Exodus and Leviticus for the new translation of the Bible to be issued by the Jewish Publication Society of America.

This makes the first time that the Grand Mufti has been elected by Islamic scholars rather than appointed by the president. The position of Grand Mufti is seen as very influential in Egypt as well as throughout the Arab and Islamic world.

Ritchie Wenaweser and Simone Steiner joined for vocals. In the same year, the band secured a record deal with Witchhunt Records and subsequently released their first album, Das Rabenland. a romantically inclined darkwave album that immediately found acceptance within the genre. A year later, WeltenBrand signed to Falks' own M.O.S. Records Ltd. to record their second album, Das Nachtvolk, released in 1997. This featured the violinist Daniela Nipp for the first time and remained true to the band's sound, while improving upon both the musical and vocal arrangements. Additionally, Richard Lederer of Summoning done guest vocals for this album. The band's third album, Der Untergang Von Trisona, was released in 1999 and received praise from the media for its bombastic appeal and relentless energy apparent on each track. Its neodark classic style, boasting of medieval influences, also caught the attention of Liv Kristine (Leaves Eyes, ex Theatre of Tragedy) and Alexander Krull (Atrocity), whose enthusiasm can be heard on the album, as both of them contribruted vocally to this work. WeltenBrand released In Gottes Oder Des Teufels Namen in 2002. The album concentrated on clear vocal arrangements and straightforward compositions without losing the band's uniqueness. While each WeltenBrand album presents a different perspective of their sound, they do share a common thread. The lyrics always stem from Liechtensteins myths and legends as told by Dr. Otto Seger. Following the disbandment of M.O.S. Records Ltd., WeltenBrand signed to Napalm Records in fall 2002 and began working on their fifth album, The End of the Wizard, released in February 2006. The tracks on this work continued to draw upon the magical uniqueness of songwriter Oliver Falks' compositions, while becoming more appealing to the masses. The End Of The Wizard promises to deliver an enchanting journey into the mythical world of Liechtenstein's myriad legends and sagas. In spring 2005 two new members joined the band, Adrian Büchel (drums) and Christian Sele (bass guitar). At the end of 2005, Steiner left the band and was replaced by the female vocalist Dina Falk (former of Zambelli). Weltenbrand's fifth album The End of the Wizard, was released in August 2006. In July 2007, male vocalist Wenaweser was replaced by the female vocalist Manja Wagner (former of Gückel). Currently, the band is working on a sixth album.

He raced until he was eight years old, winning sixteen of his twenty five races. His first race was in 1802, with his first big win, the Third Class of the Oatlands Stakes, coming in 1803. He went on to win eight King's Plates and recorded wins over several leading racehorses of the time. He was owned by Sir Hedworth Williamson throughout his racing career. Walton later became a successful stallion and was champion sire of Great Britain twice. He sired the Derby winner Phantom, 2000 Guineas winner Nectar and St. Leger winner St Patrick. Walton's sire Sir Peter Teazle Background Walton was a bay colt bred by Sir Hedworth Williamson and foaled in 1799. He was sired by Sir Peter Teazle, who won the Derby at Epsom in 1787. Sir Peter then went on to become a very successful stallion and was champion sire of Great Britain ten times. Amongst his other progeny were Derby winners Sir Harry, Archduke, Ditto and Paris, as well as six other Classic winners and the sire Haphazard. Walton's dam was Arethusa, a daughter of Dungannon. Walton was the fourth of Arethusa's thirteen foals, which included Derby winners Ditto (Walton's full brother) and Pan. Racing career =1802: Three-year-old season= Walton, then unnamed, made his first racecourse appearance on 20 April 1802 at Newmarket, where he lost a sweepstakes of 100 guineas each to Pipylin. The following month, also at Newmarket, he finished unplaced in a £50 subscription plate, behind the winner - Lord Clermont's Whiskey colt. His only other start as a three-year- old was at Epsom on 4 June, when he faced four rivals in a race of three two- mile heats. After finishing third in the first heat, he won the remaining two to win the race. Dotterel finished in second place and Wilkes third. =1803: Four-year-old season= Walton returned to the track on 13 April 1803 for the Third Class of the Oatlands Stakes at Newmarket. Priced at 7/2, Walton was the outsider of the three runners and was carrying less weight than either of his rivals. He won the race from Duxbury, with Eleanor in third. At the end of the month Walton beat Lignum Vitae over the two-mile Ditch-in course at Newmarket. At the York August Meeting, Walton started as the odds on favourite for a Handicap Sweepstakes over three miles. The race finished in a dead heat between Stockton and Walton, with Tankersley in third place. Stockton and Walton took part in a runoff, which the former won. In his next race, Walton beat Orlando and Allegranti to win the King's Plate over about four miles. =1804: Five-year-old season= On 2 April 1804, the first day of the season, Walton finished second to Aniseed in the Craven Stakes at Newmarket. Third placed Eleanor was the only other of the seven other horses that could be placed by the judge. On 19 April, at the First Spring Meeting, he beat Duxbury and Slapband to win the King's Plate over the Round Course (about four miles). At Guildford in May he raced against Enchantress and Rumbo for the King's Plate, run in three four-mile heats. Walton, who was the favourite, won the first heat, but finished second to Enchantress in the second. Before the third heat (which only Walton and Enchantress took part in) Enchantress was the 2/5 favourite, but Walton took the victory to win the race. On 18 July at Salisbury he took part in the King's Plate in four-mile heats. Walton won both heats against his only rival Little Chance to win the race. He won another King's Plate in August, this time beating Mr. Frogley's colt in two four-mile heats at Winchester. In the next race he walked over for a sweepstakes of 10 guineas each. A month later he beat a John Bull filly in both of the four-mile heats to win the King's Plate at Warwick. On 11 September he beat three rivals to win the Lichfield King's Plate. At Newmarket's First October Meeting he finished last of the three runners in the King's Plate, behind winner Parasol and Sir Harry Dimsdale. =1805: Six-year-old season= Walton again started his season in April, when he beat Penelope (who was carrying one pound more in weight) in a 200 guineas match over the Beacon Course. At the First Spring Meeting he started the odds-on favourite for a £50 Subscription over the Round Course. He won the race, beating runner-up Pipylin and third-placed Parasol. At the same meeting, two days later, he walked over for the King's Plate. On 15 May, at Newmarket's Second Spring Meeting, he finished second to Parasol in the Jockey-Club Plate, which was run over the distance of about four miles. Walton didn't race again until the end of July, when he contested the Somerset Stakes at Brighton. He started the race as the 5/2 second favourite and crossed the line in first place. However, Walton, along with second placed Houghton Lass and third placed Enterprize, were disqualified for taking the wrong course. This promoted Orville, who was last of the four finishers, into first place. On 2 August, Walton beat Brough to win the County Plate at Lewes. They next day he raced for the four-mile Ladies Plate. Starting as the favourite he won the race from Cardinal Beaufort, with Imposter finishing third and Enterprize last of the four runners. Walton ran again over four miles in the very next race, losing to Orville. =1806: Seven-year-old season= Walton's only engagement in 1806 was a sweepstakes of 200 guineas each in April, but he paid a forfeit to Parasol and the race never took place. =1807: Eight-year-old season= Walton's only race as an eight-year-old was the Craven Stakes on 30 March 1807, when he finished second to Selim, beating third placed Currycomb and eight others. He was then retired to stud and covered mares during 1807. Stud career Walton's son Phantom Walton first stood as a stallion at Mr. Perren's stables in Newmarket for a fee of 10 guineas and half a guinea for the groom. He later stood at several different places during his stud career, including Gipping-Hall near Stowmarket and the Grantham Arms in Boroughbridge, with his fee rising as high as 20 guineas. Walton immediately became a successful stallion. In 1810, the year the first of his offspring started racing, he sired 7 winners of 27 races, including Phantom winning the Derby. He became champion sire of Great Britain in 1816 and 1818 and his most notable progeny were: * Phantom (1808) - was unbeaten as a three-year-old, including victories in the Derby and a match against the Oaks winner Morel. After retiring from racing he became a champion stallion, siring Derby winners Cedric and Middleton, and 2000 Guineas winners Enamel and Pindarrie. Phantom also sired the mare Cobweb who won the Oaks in 1824 and later became an influential broodmare. * Rainbow (1808) - won the Claret Stakes as a four-year-old. * Walton mare (1808) - foaled the 2000 Guineas winner Nicolo. * Spotless (1809) - was the dam of Lamplighter, who won the Craven Stakes and was a good sire. * Partisan (1811) - won several races at Newmarket and sired Derby winner Mameluke and champion sire Venison. * Walton mare (1812) - foaled the Derby winner Cedric. * Nectar (1813) - won the 2000 Guineas and Riddlesworth Stakes. * Waterloo (1814) - won the Newmarket St. Leger. * St Patrick (1817) - won the St. Leger. Walton died in December 1825.

The tower contained bed chambers and the grand stairway of the original residence, which stood next to it. It was completed between 1409–1411 by Jean sans Peur. The original hôtel occupied about a hectare of land, the boundaries of which are now marked by the rues Étienne Marcel, Montorgueil, Saint-Sauveur, and Saint-Denis. The tower itself is located at 20 rue Étienne Marcel, in the courtyard of an elementary school. It is one of the best surviving examples of medieval residential architecture in Paris. The tower is open to the public and presents changing expositions on life in the Middle Ages.Ayers 2004, p. 56 (\\"2.1 Tour Jean-sans-Peur\\").\\"Ancien hôtel des ducs de Bourgogne : Tour de Jean-sans-Peur\\" at the Monuments historiques website.Some of the information in this article was translated from the equivalent article in the French Wikipedia (version 16 mars 2013 à 15:44).Official website of the Tour Jean- sans-Peur (in French). History =The Hôtel d'Artois= The first hôtel particulier or manor, on the site was built by the Counts of Artois, whose domains included most of northern France and Flanders. In 1270, Robert II, Count of Artois, the nephew of king Louis IX, known as \\"Saint Louis\\", bought several houses and about a hectare of land in the northern part of the city, adjacent to the wall of Philippe Auguste, the first city wall of Paris, which had been built between 1190 and 1290. Part of the land was outside the wall, the other part within Paris. As the city grew, a new wall built by Charles V, completed in 1383 brought the entire property within the city limits. Little is known about this first hôtel, which was largely rebuilt by its later owners. =Residence of Dukes of Burgundy= In 1369 the hôtel passed to Philip the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy, by his marriage to Marguerite, the Countess of Flanders and of Artois. The records of the concierge of the house show that between July 1371 and Easter 1375, he carried out important construction works, including the building of a tower.Plagnieux 1988, p. 11. After Philip's death in 1404, it became the property of Jean de Bourgogne, better known as Jean sans Peur, or John the Fearless. Jean sans Peur The construction of the tower took place during the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), when the kings of France and England fought for supremacy in France. Paris was also a battleground of the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War (1404–1435). Beginning in 1392, king Charles VI suffered increasingly from madness, and two branches of the royal family fought over who would rule the country: the Armagnacs, supporters of the king's brother, Louis d'Orléans, and the Burgundians, led by his cousin, the new Duke of Burgundy, Jean sans Peur. On November 23, 1407, just as it appeared that the Armagnacs had triumphed, Louis d'Orléans was murdered on the street by men in the pay of Jean sans Peur. In 1408, Jean quickly regained favor by leading a successful military campaign in Flanders, and was forgiven by the king, who made him the guardian of his heir, the dauphin, Louis, Duke of Guyenne.Centre des monuments nationaux 2002, p. 299. To celebrate his triumph and to display his wealth and power, between 1409 and 1411, Jean built a palatial new residence, attached to a tower, which contained both a grand spiral staircase which gave access to the main building, a large hall and, at the top of a separate narrow winding stairway, to private chambers. The Chronicle of Enguerrand de Monstrelet (c. 1400-1444) reported: \\"In this time a force of workers made for John a strong chamber of well-crafted stone, in the form of a tower, and there he slept at night. This tower had the advantage of keeping him safe.\\".Chronique of Enguerrand de Monstrelet, volume 1, chapter 38, cited in Rivière and Lavoye 2007, p. 7. The records of his concierge show that the additions to the hôtel, costing 10,000 livres, were made between February 1409 and May 1411, requiring the Duke to obtain several loans from wealthy Parisians. Although the base of the tower may have been built by his father, the upper part was probably built by Jean sans Peur. From 1409 to 1413, Jean sans Peur conducted his fight against the Armagnacs from his fortified residence. He had his own unofficial militia, called the Cabochiens, made up of butchers, knackers and other workers of the powerful butcher corporation Grande Boucherie Saint-Jacques. However, the opposition to his rule grew so strong that he was forced to flee Paris in 1413. He returned in triumph in 1418, but in 1419 he was murdered by his opponents on the bridge of Montereau, under the eyes of the new Dauphin, the future Charles VII.Riviere and Lavoye 2007, p. 15. Philip the good by Roger van der Weyden (about 1450) The residence was inherited by his son, Philip the Good, but the new Duke spent very little time there, dividing his time between his palaces in Dijon, Brussels, Lille, and other cities in his duchy. During his reign, Burgundy reached to the height of its glory; he greatly expanded its territory, conquering most of the Netherlands and buying the Duchy of Luxemburg. During one campaign, his soldiers captured Joan of Arc, and handed her over to the English, who were his allies at the time. He was a famous patron of the arts, commissioning works from Jan van Eyck and other Flemish masters, and he spent a large portion of the Duchy's income on gold cloth, silk and other fabrics for his wardrobe. He only returned permanently in 1461, after an absence of twenty-six years, when king Louis XI returned to Paris. Thereafter, he entertained lavishly, holding banquets under a large tent of velours and silk erected in the garden. On these occasions, the walls of the tower were decorated from tapestries from Arras, in his province of Flanders. The old city wall of Philippe Auguste, was still in good condition and was connected to the tower by a doorway on the first floor, still visible. According to one chronicle of the time, Philippe le Bon was able to travel from the tower to the Hôtel de Soissons, near Les Halles, without setting foot on the city streets. After his death in 1467, the duchy and house became the property of his son, Charles the Bold, though the new duke never lived in the house. He chose to live in the Tour de Nesle, a fortified residence on the left bank across the Seine from the Palais de la Cité, which had been given to him by king Louis XI. The new duke allied himself first with the King of France, then conspired against him. Charles the Bold was killed in battle against the army of the Duke of Lorraine and the Swiss in January 1477. He had no sons, and the title of Duke of Burgundy died with him. King Louis XI took possession of the province of Burgundy, and of the Hôtel de Bourgogne. =The Renaissance and the first Paris theater= De la Gouache map of Paris showing the wall of Philippe Auguste and the hôtel de Bourgogne in about 1535 The kings of France had no need for an additional residence in the city. In 1539, Francis I gave the hôtel to one of his allies, Diego de Mendoza, but four years later changed his mind and sold the property. It was divided into twenty lots, separated by a new street, rue Françoise (named after the King François I, now rue Française). In 1543, the tower and surrounding lots were purchased for 5200 livres tournois by a Paris merchant named Jean Rouvert, who had pioneered industry of floating lumber down the Seine to Paris. In 1548, he sold a parcel of the land measuring 16 by 17 toises on rue Mauconseil to the first authorized theater troupe in Paris, the Confrérie de la Passion. A theater building, often simply called the Hôtel de Bourgogne, was constructed. It was the first permanent theater building in ParisRivière and Lavoye 2007, p. 19. and was used until 1783,Hartnoll 1983, pp. 97–98 (\\"Bourgogne, Théâtre de l'Hôtel de\\"). after which it was replaced by a leather market.Hervey 1847, p. 61). Only the outer walls were preserved. In 1866, the old building was torn down to make way for the construction of rue Étienne Marcel. =Ruin and restoration= The Tour Jean sans Peur in 1882, after the construction of rue Étienne Marcel in 1867 The tower itself was uninhabited throughout a large part of the 17th century. Vincent de Paul opened a charitable institution there to distribute food to the needy of the quarter. In the second half of the century it was owned by Germain Courtin, the secretary of Louis XIV. He rented the lower part of the tower for a cabaret, which enjoyed considerable success. In the first part of the 18th century, a large part of the hôtel became a private house, while the tower, with the installation of stoves in the rooms, was made into a lodging house. In 1782, the tower and adjacent buildings were bought by Charles-Louis Sterlin, a wealthy hardware merchant, who installed his residence, storeroom, workshop and sales room. Some of his workers inhabited the rooms of the tower. The business was taken over in 1832 by one of his employees, Eugène Bricard, who turned it into a well-known manufactory of locks. It remained in business until 1871.Rivière and Layoye 2007, p. 25. In the meanwhile, the grand reconstruction of the center of Paris by Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann dramatically altered the neighborhood. In 1868, the construction of rue Étienne Marcel caused the demolition of the other parts of the hôtel, leaving the tower standing alone, and removing the buildings which had blocked the view of the tower from the south. The tower soon attracted the attention of architectural historians and preservationists. The tower was purchased by the City of Paris in 1874, and was declared a historical monument in 1884. In the meanwhile, between 1875 and 1878, an elementary school was constructed just to the east of the tower, resting on the foundations of the medieval hôtel. The stone western wall of the school is all that remains of the old grand logis of the hôtel. Major restoration projects were proposed in the succeeding years, but it was not until 1893 that work was begun under the architect Gion, aimed mainly at stabilizing and strengthening the upper structure. The medieval lucarnes, or attic windows, were removed. In 1991 and 1992, another important restoration was made by the architect P. Prunet. The tower was returned to its original medieval appearance, with the exception of the roof, which lost its medieval chimney and baccula. The tower opened to the public in 1999, thanks to the sponsorship of a private association, Les Amis de la Tour de Jean sans Peur'. Description The entrance to the tower was on the east side. =The main stairway and the large hall= The vaulted ceiling of the largest chamber, nine meters high, open on three sides The tower served as the main stairway for the grand corps of the hôtel; it was attached to south wall of the larger building. A grand circular stairway occupies nine square meters, and, like other grand palace stairways of the time, has wide bays so people could be seen coming up and down. It climbs 17 meters. The former entrances to the grand corps are now blocked, since only the wall remains; it is now the wall of the elementary school next door. Persons coming from the outside could not go directly to the grand stairway; they had to climb by a separate stairway to the next floor up. The room on the ground floor was connected by a large archway with an adjoining building, two stories high, equipped with latrines. On the first floor above the ground floor, one doorway connected with the first floor of the grand corps in the adjoining hôtel to the north, while another doorway gave entrance to the top of the wall of Philippe Auguste to the south of the tower. Over the doorway is a carving of another emblem of the Duke, a level and a plane. On the second floor is the largest chamber in the tower, nine meters high, opening on three sides. The chamber is covered with a quadripartite rib vault with springing points (on the outer walls) decorated with angels carrying Jean sans Peur's coat of arms. Its main function seems to have been simply to hold up the upper rooms on top of it, though it may also have contained a bell. The grand stairway continues upwards. At the top of the stairway is a chamber with the most celebrated decorative element in the tower, a vault decorated with carved stone vegetation. (See decoration). In the Middle Ages this chamber gave access to a small balcony with a view of the façade of the main building. The chamber also gives access to a narrower winding stairway which leads upwards to two private chambers. =The upper rooms= Riviėre and Lavoye 2007, p. 11. On the top floor is a smaller and simpler room, most likely that of the watchman, located under the wooden frame of the roof, and lit by five windows. It still has some of its original timber framework, and the openings of machicolations. It was first restored in 1894, and then again in 1991-92, with a new roof. =Decoration= Viré and Lavoye 2005, p. 192.Riviėre and Lavoye 2007, p. 13. Some of the original floor tiles of the tower are on display, some of which display the marguerite flower, the emblem of Marguerite de Male, the mother of Jean sans Peur. They were found during the excavation of the tower in 1877. Two small stained glass windows with the emblems of Jean sans Peur and of the Duke of Burgundy can also be found in the upper chambers, but they are not original. =Construction= The design and construction of the tower was the work of Robert de Helbuterne, the master of public works for Paris beginning in 1406. The stone came from quarries near Paris; hard high-quality limestone, or liaise franc, probably from Notre-Dame-des-Champs near Val-de-Grâce, for the stairs and around the windows and doors, and the lower quality lambourdes or wall-plate, Charenton, Gentilly and Ivry. The quality of the stone cutting and masonry was extremely high in its precision and evenness, unlike that of a simple defensive tower.Viré and Lavoye 2005, pp. 189-192. The construction took place in three phases: the first was the grand corps or residence, of which only one wall remains. This building had three levels; a ground floor divided into several rooms; then a first floor six meters high, then second floor with a high gabled roof. The building was twenty-three meters high, while the stairway tower was planned to be 18 meters high, stopping at the decorative sculptural vault. It originally opened onto a narrow promenade with a wide view of Paris. After construction had begun, a decision was made to alter the plan of the stairway tower: it was extended to the south, so that it touched the old city wall, and it was made higher, with two habitable rooms and an attic where a watchman could be stationed. The additional rooms were served by a narrow winding stairway, easier to defend. The decision may have been made because of the growing conflict in Paris between the Burgundians and the Armagnacs. To provide support for the new upper floors, a narrow chamber nine meters high was created on the second floor, which had no evident purpose other than making the tower higher. The quality of stone in the newer parts of the tower was less than that in the original work. Gradually, the stairway tower rose to become higher than the building it originally served. Before the hôtel was completed, the plan underwent a third modification: the windows of the ground floor of the residence building were walled up, making it more secure, and additional levels and rooms were added. The residence came to resemble a fortress. The materials used in the third phase were of lower quality than in the original portions. Furthermore, the records of payments to the workers show that little work was done on the buildings during the summers of 1409 and 1410, due to the intensification of the war between the Armagnacs and Burgundians, which had spread to Paris. The building was finally completed in 1411, but its builder, Jean sans Peur, left Paris in 1413 and only returned in 1418; he was assassinated the following year.

She moved to Europe from South Africa in 1938, and was soon hired by the Bal Tabarin. In 1939 she was offered a place in the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, but World War II began before she could join. During the occupation of Paris the Bal Tabarin was frequented by German officers; she performed there then. Unknown to the Germans, she was Jewish, but she was still interned for several months in late 1940 as an enemy alien, because as a South African, she was a British citizen. On her release she returned to the Bal Tabarin and paired up with Frederic Apcar to form the dancing duo \\"Florence et Frederic\\". They became famous, appearing on stage with the likes of Edith Piaf and Maurice Chevalier, while Waren at the same time aided the French Resistance. She hid fellow Jews in her apartment, helped Jews find their way from one safe house to the next, smuggled supplies and arms to the French Resistance, and, after a performance in Germany for French prisoners of war, collected letters prisoners had written to their relatives, which if discovered could have made her a prisoner. In 1944 Frederic rented a house in the suburbs to hide her and several other Jewish performers after learning she was to be arrested. Florence married Stanley Waren in 1949, who she met performing in New York at the Copacabana with Frederic. She then ended the dancing duo with Frederic (but trained a replacement); Frederic died in 2008. Florence stayed in New York with Stanley and appeared on the Kate Smith and Ed Sullivan shows, as well as in plays. She also choreographed shows Stanley directed in Africa, Taiwan, and China. From approximately 1973 until 1983, she was a professor of theater and dance at City College, and she led the department for part of that time. She was also a dance panelist on the New York State Council on the Arts. She died in 2012, and her obituary was included in The Socialite who Killed a Nazi with Her Bare Hands: And 144 Other Fascinating People who Died this Year, a collection of New York Times obituaries published in 2012. There is a documentary about her by her son Mark Waren, titled Dancing Lessons. He also made two documentaries about her friends, Romance and Resistance and The Count of Montmarte. Romance and Resistance is about Gisy Varga, a Hungarian-born nude dancer at the Bal Tabarin who had an affair with a Jewish doctor and hid him from the Nazis. The Count of Montmarte is about Mario Lembo, a gay Italian aristocrat-turned-performer and member of Josephine Baker’s touring company, who supported the resistance and aided Jews.

Her son, Armand Lavergne, is thought to be their illegitimate offspring. Later into her life she would become a Catholic nun. Early life Émilie Barthe was the daughter of Joseph-Guillaume Barthe, a lawyer, journalist and political figure in Canada East, and Louise-Adélaïde Pacaud, the sister of Édouard-Louis Pacaud. Marriage and children In 1876, Barthe married Joseph Lavergne, a Quebec lawyer, judge, editor and political figure. Barthe would change her last name to Lavergne. Their first child was born in 1877, Gabrielle. In 1880, they had a son Armand Lavergne, who would become a lawyer, journalist and political figure, serving in the House of Commons and the Legislative Assembly of Quebec. Relationship with Wilfrid Laurier Beginning in 1878, Laurier had an \\"ambiguous relationship\\" with the then married Émilie Barthe.Réal Bélanger, Macdonald and Laurier Days Despite being married to Zoé Lafontaine, he maintained his relationship to Barthe as she relished literature and politics just as he did, while Lady Laurier was not an intellectual. The two corresponded with letters. Towards the end of her life she gave 41 of Laurier's letters to her nephew. Among those letters was this passage from August 23, 1891: Since Laurier became the seventh Prime Minister of Canada on July 11, 1896, he could not resume his affair with her. It was by his decision that on August 4, 1897, Joseph Lavergne, who been a Member of Parliament, was made a judge of the Superior Court for the district of Ottawa. This appointment encouraged the family to move to Ottawa, where Barthe and Laurier could continue their relations. Sir Wilfrid Laurier began to realize the potential damage of the rumours, he returned Barthe's letters to her and in 1901, he positioned Joseph Lavergne from Ottawa to Montreal. He limited his communication by sending his regards to her through her husband and children. Armand Renaud Lavergne is widely thought to be the illegitimate son between Émilie Barthe and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. When Renaud Lavergne was younger he bore an uncanny facial resemblance to Laurier. Later life In 1922, her husband, Joseph Lavergne died. On October 15, 1924, at the age of 75, Émilie joined the Grey Nuns as a recluse. The loss of her eldest child and only daughter, Gabrielle, in 1928, sent Barthe into a depression. Barthe would eventually die on May 10, 1930. She was buried in Arthabaska.

Universal basic education Basic education featured heavily in the 1997 ISCED document, but the term was not included in the glossary. Each country interpreted the term in different ways, and leading up to the 2011 revision, a discussion paper was issued to seek clarification. In most countries, ISCED 1 corresponds to the nationally designated primary education, and basic education includes that and also ISCED 2 lower secondary education (the lower level of secondary school). In other countries, where there is no break between primary and lower secondary education “basic education” covers the entire compulsory school period. For statistical reasons, ISCED 1 is then considered to be the first six years of schooling. Universal basic education is regarded as a priority for developing countries and is the focus of the Education For All movement led by UNESCO. It is also included in the Millennium Development Goals as goal number 2: achieve universal primary education by 2015. An extensive number of studies have proven its benefits for public health (e.g. lower spread of HIV/AIDS; better vaccination; prevention and medication of disease; better nutrition; lower maternal, infant, and child mortality), demography (e.g. longer life expectancy, accelerated demographic transition through better birth control) and the economy (e.g. increased purchase power, increased productivity in traditional sectors, increased demand on service sectors). Other benefits, although more difficult to measure, include a beneficial impact on democracy, human rights, governance, and political stability through increased understanding of non-violent ways to solve problems and mutual understanding between groups in conflict. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), established by UNICEF in 1989, protects children's inalienable rights by setting standards for multiple issues, one of which is education.  Gender equality in basic education  Gender equality in education has traditionally been narrowly equated with gender parity at different levels of formal education. Gender has been a traditional factor of inequality and disparity in education, most often to the disadvantage of girls and women. Yet there has been significant progress in narrowing the gap around the world since 2000, with a larger proportion of girls and women accessing different levels of formal education. Indeed, gender parity in primary education has been achieved in Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, North America and Western Europe. In addition, significant progress has been made since 2000 in narrowing the gender gap, particularly in South and West Asia and to a lesser degree in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab States. However, despite the significant progress made, the majority of out-of-school children are girls, while two-thirds of youth and adults with low levels of literacy in the world are women. To help ensure women's empowerment, boys and men must also be engaged in the fight against gender inequality. This must begin with basic education.

The producing sectors build upon a wealth of clothing technology some of which, like the loom, the cotton gin, and the sewing machine heralded industrialization not only of the previous textile manufacturing practices. Terminology Clothing factory in Montreal, Quebec, in 1941. Nylon stocking inspection in Malmö, Sweden, in 1954. Garment factory workers in Bangladesh, in 2013. By the early 20th century, the industry in the developed world often involved immigrants in \\"sweat shops\\", which were usually legal but were sometimes illegally operated. They employed people in crowded conditions, working manual sewing machines, and being paid less than a living wage. This trend worsened due to attempts to protect existing industries which were being challenged by developing countries in South East Asia, the Indian subcontinent and Central America. Although globalization saw the manufacturing largely outsourced to overseas labor markets, there has been a trend for the areas historically associated with the trade to shift focus to the more white collar associated industries of fashion design, fashion modeling and retail. Areas historically involved heavily in the \\"rag trade\\" include London and Milan in Europe, and the SoHo district in New York City. There are considerable overlaps between the terms clothing-/garment-, textile- and fashion industry. The clothing sector is concerned with all types of clothes, from fashion to uniforms, e-textiles and workwear. Textile industry is less concerned with the fashion aspect but produces the fabrics and fibres that are required for tailoring. The fashion industry closely follows - and sets - fashion trends to always supply the latest in non-functional clothing. Production The garment industry is a major contributor to the economies of many countries. The industry for Ready Made Garments has been criticized by labor advocates for the use of sweatshops, piece work and child labor. Working conditions in low-cost countries have received critical media coverage, especially in the aftermath of large scale disasters like the 2013 Savar building collapse or the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. In 2016, the largest apparel exporting nations were China ($161 billion), Bangladesh ($28 billion), Vietnam ($25 billion), India ($18 billion), Hong Kong ($16 billion), Turkey ($15 billion) and Indonesia ($7 billion).http://www.thedailystar.net/business/exporters- hardly-grab-orders-diverted-china-1446907 By 2025, it is projected that the United States market will be worth $385 billion. It is also projected that the e-commerce revenue will be worth $146 billion in the United States by 2023. =Production in developing countries= The worldwide market for textiles and apparel exports in 2013 according to United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database stood at $772 billion. In 2016, the largest apparel exporting nations were China ($161 billion), Bangladesh ($28 billion), Vietnam ($25 billion), India ($18 billion), Hong Kong ($16 billion), Turkey ($15 billion) and Indonesia ($7 billion). =Pakistan= The textile and garment sector accounts for 70% of Pakistan's exports, but the working conditions of workers are deplorable. Small manufacturing workshops generally do not sign employment contracts, do not respect the minimum wage and sometimes employ children. Violations of labour law also occur among major subcontractors of international brands, where workers may be beaten, insulted by their superiors or paid below the minimum wage. Factories do not comply with safety standards, leading to accidents: in 2012, 255 workers died in a fire at a Karachi factory. With 547 labour inspectors in Pakistan supervising the country's 300,000 factories, the textile industry is out of control. Nor are workers protected by trade unions, which are prohibited in industrial export zones. Elsewhere, \\"workers involved in the creation of trade unions are victims of violence, intimidation, threats or dismissals\\".https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2019/01/25/un-rapport-de- l-ong-human-rights-watch-denonce-les-conditions-de-travail-dans-le-textile-au- pakistan_5414575_3234.html =India= Indian clothing and apparel industry is one of the largest employment generating sector after agriculture in India and is sixth largest exporter in the world. Indian clothing industry dates back to Harappan Civilisation and is one of the oldest clothing manufacturing industry in the world. https://www.thesynerg.com India produces various types of clothing including woven and knitted clothing. Tiruppur, Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Ludihana and Chennai are the important manufacturing centres of India. With the current government's push for \\"Make in India\\" campaign, Clothing industry is set to revive in the near future and India will be dominant exporter of Clothing to the World. =Bangladesh= Many Western multinationals use labour in Bangladesh, which is one of the cheapest in the world: 30 euros per month compared to 150 or 200 in China. In April 2013, at least 1,135 garment factory workers died in the collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory, Dhaka. Other fatal accidents due to unsanitary factories have affected Bangladesh: in 2005 a factory collapsed and caused the death of 64 people. In 2006, a series of fires killed 85 people and injured 207 others. In 2010, some 30 people died of asphyxiation and burns in two serious fires. In 2006, tens of thousands of workers mobilized in one of the country's largest strike movements, affecting almost all of the 4,000 factories. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) uses police forces to crack down. Three workers were killed, hundreds more were wounded by bullets, or imprisoned. In 2010, after a new strike movement, nearly 1,000 people were injured among workers as a result of the repression. https://www.bastamag.net/Au-Bangladesh-une-ouvriere-du =Ethiopia= Employees of Ethiopian garment factories, who work for brands such as Guess, H&M; or Calvin Klein, receive a monthly salary of 26 dollars per month. These very low wages have led to low productivity, frequent strikes and high turnover. Some factories have replaced all their employees on average every 12 months, according to the 2019 report of the Stern Centre for Business and Human Rights at New York University. The report states:\\" Rather than the docile and cheap labour force promoted in Ethiopia, foreign-based suppliers have met employees who are unhappy with their pay and living conditions and who want to protest more and more by stopping work or even quitting. In their eagerness to create a \\"made in Ethiopia\\" brand, the government, global brands and foreign manufacturers did not anticipate that the base salary was simply too low for workers to make a living from. »https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2019/05/08/en-ethiopie-les-petites- mains-de-h-m-ou-calvin-klein-gagnent-23-euros-par-mois_5459655_3212.html Retail Unions See also *Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh *Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety *Clothing line *Fashion industry **Fashion design services **Fast fashion **Fashion accessory *List of fabric names *List of textile fibres *Nylon riots *Savile Row tailoring *Shoemaking *Sweatshop *Tailor *Textile *Textile industry * Uniforms Further reading =United States= * Carpenter, Jesse Thomas.

It was among the twelve original baronies of Achaea, but was conquered by the Byzantines in 1320. History View of the ruins of the Akova Castle. The Barony of Akova was established ca. 1209, after the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Crusaders, and was one of the original twelve secular baronies within the Principality of Achaea. Along with the Barony of Patras, Akova was one of the two largest and most important baronies of the Principality, with twenty-four knight's fiefs attached to it.Miller (1921), pp. 71–72Bon (1969), pp. 104, 394 The barony's capital was the fortress of Akova or Mattegrifon (\\"Kill-Greek\\", \\"Grifon\\" being a French term for the Greeks) built on the mountainous area known in the Chronicle of the Morea as Mesarea, separating Elis from Arcadia and dominating the upper valley of the Alpheios river, by the baronial family of de Rosières, of Burgundian origin.Bon (1969), pp. 104, 393–394 The only known baron of the barony's early period is Walter of Rosières, who is first recorded in a list of fief folders in 1228/30 and by the Chronicle as having died childless, ca. 1273. To fill the period down to 1209, Karl Hopf hypothesized that there were two barons, father and son, named Walter, but, as A. Bon points out, the existence of a now-forgotten baron before 1228/30 is equally possible.Bon (1969), pp. 104–105, 394 Walter's sole heir was Margaret of Passavant, his sister's daughter by John of Nully, Baron of Passavant. Margaret had resided in Constantinople as a hostage to the Byzantine court since 1262, and on her return to the Principality, she tried to claim her inheritance but was unable to do so, since by Achaean feudal law, any heir had to bring his claim within at least two years and two days from the death of the last holder, or the claim was forfeit. As Margaret had delayed her arrival, Prince William II of Villehardouin had already confiscated the Barony of Akova (Passavant having been lost to the Byzantines). Margaret's claims became the subject of a celebrated legal dispute, which was abjudicated in a parliament held at Glarentsa, probably in 1276. Even though she married the influential John of Saint Omer to promote her claims, the parliament found in favour of the Prince, who nevertheless ceded a third of the barony (8 fiefs) to Margaret and John, while the remainder, along with the fortress of Akova itself, became a fief of William's youngest daughter, Margaret.Bon (1969), pp. 105, 147–148, 394 Margaret of Villehardouin augmented her domains in 1297 through the donation of a few fiefs and castles by her sister, Princess Isabella.Bon (1969), pp. 172, 394–395 In ca. 1311, Margaret sought, by virtue of her descent, to claim the Principality, or at least a portion of it, from the Angevin Kings of Naples who had controlled it since 1278. To this end, in February 1314 she wedded her only daughter, Isabel of Sabran, to Ferdinand of Majorca, and passed her titles and claims to them. She then returned to Achaea, where she was imprisoned by the Angevin bailli Nicholas le Maure and died in captivity in February or March 1315. Ferdinand invaded Achaea and tried to claim the Principality from Louis of Burgundy, but fell in the Battle of Manolada in July 1316. In the wake of Margaret's death and the Majorcan invasion, the Barony of Akova was confiscated and added to the princely domain.Bon (1969), pp. 190–193, 395Topping (1975), pp. 110–114 Five years later, in 1320, Akova along with the castles of Karytaina, Polyphengos, and Saint George in Skorta, fell to the Byzantines under Andronikos Asen.Bon (1969), pp. 202, 395Topping (1975), p. 117 References Sources  Category:States and territories established in 1209 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1320 Category:Medieval Arcadia Category:Medieval Elis Category:Baronies of the Principality of Achaea ","title":"Barony of Akova"},{"id":"39751338","text":"Coonamessett Airport was an airfield operational in the mid-20th century in Hatchville, Massachusetts.

Fitzgerald was born in 1865 in Rockhampton, Queensland, the fifth son of Jessie and Thomas Henry Fitzgerald. He received his education in France and was a noted scholar. He became a barrister and he married Joan Mary Cahill from Ireland. Fitzgerald was a captain with the Queensland Irish Volunteers. The resignation of John Francis Buckland caused a by-election in 1892 for a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland representing the Electoral district of Bulimba. Fitzgerald contested the election for the Labor Party, but was beaten by James Robert Dickson. In the same year, Fitzgerald moved to Longreach. In the 1893 colonial election, Fitzgerald contested the seat of Mitchell as an independent Labor candidate against John A. Campbell, the official Labor candidate, and John Cameron. It was an intense campaign, with many Labor supporters travelling to Mitchell in support of Campbell, including Tommy Ryan, the sitting member of Barcoo. Cameron won the poll, but Fitzgerald had much more voter support than Campbell, with 261 versus 71 votes cast. Fitzgerald received the Labor Party endorsement for the 1896 election, and on 4 April 1896, he defeated Cameron in Mitchell. In the 1899 election, Fitzgerald was again successful in Mitchell, defeating Messrs Edkins and Magoffin. Fitzgerald was Attorney-General of Queensland for six days in December 1899. In the 1902 state election, Fitzgerald was beaten by Arthur Cooper by 112 votes. After his defeat, Fitzgerald moved to Barcaldine, then Brisbane, back to his birthplace Rockhampton, and then Mount Morgan. He returned to Rockhampton once again in 1911. He was taken to Longreach Hospital on 9 February 1913, described as \\"not ill but off colour\\", where he died the next morning from heart failure. He was survived by his wife and family; one of his sons was Paddy Fitzgerald.

April 13, 1907.\\"Roosevelt Tells The Joy of Battle.\\" New York Times. April 13, 1907. The Rough Riders The Spanish–American War was a ten-week conflict during the spring and summer of 1898. Cuba had been waging a war of independence against Spain since 1895, an effort largely supported by the United States, which had extensive economic interests on the island. To ensure the safety of American citizens and property in Cuba, the United States sent the battleship to Havana in late January 1898. The Maine exploded and was destroyed with large loss of life on February 15, and Spain and the U.S. declared war on each other on April 25.Trask, p. 57. With only 25,000 men in the United States Army but more than 100,000 needed to prosecute the war, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt convinced Secretary of War Russell A. Alger that he could raise an all-volunteer force of 1,000 men and form a cavalry regiment. Alger offered Roosevelt a commission in the Army as a full colonel in command of a regular regiment, but Roosevelt declined.Lansford, p. 46. Alger agreed to Roosevelt's volunteer scheme, and Roosevelt resigned his post on May 6, 1898.Hendrickson, p. 104. Roosevelt was commissioned a lieutenant colonel of volunteers and declined command of the regiment (due to his military inexperience) in favor of his friend, Colonel Leonard Wood. Although formally named the \\"1st United States Volunteer Cavalry\\", the press nicknamed the regiment the \\"Rough Riders\\" because most of the men were cowboys, frontiersmen, railroad workers, Native Americans, and similar \\"rough\\" people from the West. The 1,060 Rough Riders departed their training camp in San Antonio, Texas, on May 29, and arrived in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, on June 19.Hutton, p. 286-287. They participated in the Battle of Las Guasimas on June 24, during which they successfully turned the right flank of a retreating Spanish Army force with superior weapons and more men.Hutton, p. 288-290. On July 1, the regiment participated in the Battle of San Juan Hill, during which it successfully charged Kettle Hill (the famous \\"charge up San Juan Hill\\") and dislodged another Spanish force with superior firepower.Hutton, p. 291-294. =The first Rough Rider memorials= The memorial to the Rough Riders at San Juan Hill near the old Spanish Army blockhouse in 1910. Two memorials to the Rough Riders were erected in Cuba shortly after the Spanish–American War ended. One, erected by Brigadier General Wood out of general funds provided for Cuba's military occupation,Summers, p. 441-442. Accessed June 21, 2013. was erected next to the Spanish Army blockhouse atop San Juan Hill.Davis, Moments in Hell, p. 72. This memorial stood on a square concrete base, on the four corners of which were placed artillery shells. A square plinth with sunk, blank panels on all four sides stood on the base. On the plinth rose a tapered square column with a flat top. Sunk into the face of this column was a bronze plaque, which read: \\"In memory of the officers and men of the United States army, who were killed in the assault and capture of this ridge, July 1, 1898, and in the siege of Santiago, July 1 to July 16, 1898. War between Spain and the United States.\\"Davis, \\"The Passing of San Juan Hill\\", p. 146, 151. Accessed June 21, 2013. A second memorial, specific to the Rough Riders, was erected at Las Guasimas. The provenance of this memorial is not clear. It was shaped much like the one at San Juan Hill although the building materials were much different. This monument was set on a flagstone base. Rough-hewn pieces of dark grey granite were cemented together to form a rectangular plinth (square in cross-section) atop the flagstones. A tapered square column, made of the same rough-hewn, cemented granite, rose to a flat top. An artillery shell was placed atop the column, and a bronze plaque affixed to its face. The plaque read: \\"In Memory / Of the men of /The First and Tenth United States Cavalry, / Young's Brigade / Wheeler's Division, / Who Were Killed in the / Battle of Las Guásimas / June 24th 1898.\\" Creating the Rough Rider Memorial It is not clear who first proposed a Rough Rider Memorial, or when the idea was first raised. A Rough Riders National Monument Society was organized on June 15, 1906.\\"Will Honor Rough Riders.\\" Washington Post. April 7, 1907. Lillian Capron, wife of Captain Allyn K. Capron, Jr. (the Rough Riders' first officer to be killed in action), was elected president and treasurer.\\"Drill for Monument Fund.\\" Washington Post. January 31, 1907. Eldridge E. Jordan, a prominent businessman, was elected vice president. The other members of the board of directors included Charles E. Hunter, an Oklahoma Republican politician and clerk of the Oklahoma Federal District Court; William Henry Harrison Llewellyn, a New Mexico Territory Republican politician and United States Attorney; Captain James R. Church, M.D., U.S. Army;Church received the Medal of Honor on January 10, 1906. \\"Medal for Capt. Church.\\" Washington Post. January 10, 1906. and the Reverend Henry A. Brown, U.S. Army. All the men were former Rough Riders. Rev. Brown had served as the regimental chaplain. The society also established a memorial committee. Its members included Capron, Jordan, and the rest of the society's board of directors. Additional members included Maude Wildrey Towne, wife of former Representative Charles A. Towne, and John Doyle Carmody, a prominent D.C. attorney.\\"Rough Riders' Shaft.\\" Washington Post. March 28, 1907. It is unclear exactly when approval to erect the Rough Rider Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery was given. The U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps had control of Arlington National Cemetery at the time. The erection of a monument would have required the permission of either Brigadier General Charles F. Humphrey, Sr., the Quartermaster General, or Secretary of War William Howard Taft. But no record of such permission exists. Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in as President of the United States on September 14, 1901, after the death of President William McKinley. Taft was one of Roosevelt's closest friends. Approval was very unlikely to be denied, and was probably given some time in May or early June 1906. The first fundraiser for the memorial was announced June 10, 1906\\"Society.\\" Washington Post. June 10, 1906.—five days before the society was formally organized. The Rough Rider Memorial was designed by Mrs. Capron, who decided to model the monument on the Rough Riders shaft erected by General Wood in Cuba. The bronze tablet on the memorial's face was designed by Major J.T. Knight and Major S.L. Fairson, Army officers assigned to the Quartermaster General's office in Washington, D.C. A fundraising campaign was undertaken to pay for the memorial. On June 10, 1906. Mrs. Capron had organized a party to raise money for a monument.\\"Social and Personal.\\" Washington Post. June 14, 1906. During the event, a saber was raffled off, various donated items sold, and the United States Marine Band gave a two-hour concert. President Theodore Roosevelt donated a large number of American Beauty roses from the White House Rose Garden.\\"Social and Personal.\\" Washington Post. June 16, 1906. Another fund-raiser was held on February 8, 1907, when members of the 13th Cavalry and the 4th Battery, U.S. Light Field Artillery, put on a display of horsemanship at Fort Myer, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery.\\"Fort Myer Riders Cheered.\\" Washington Post. February 9, 1907. President Roosevelt and most of Washington society were expected to attend.\\"President May See Drill.\\" Washington Post. February 7, 1907. The event drew a large crowd and raised a significant amount of money. =Construction= The Rough Riders Memorial was created from grey granite quarried in Barre, Vermont. The stone arrived at Arlington National Cemetery by February 6, 1907. The tablet included the Rough Riders insignia at the top and the plaque's tentative language read: \\"In memory of the deceased members of the First United States Volunteer Cavalry, Spanish–American War. Erected by the members and friends of the regiment.\\" The foundation for the memorial was laid on March 27, 1907. Present for this event were Mrs. Capron, Mrs. Towne, and Mr. Carmody. A time capsule in the form of a bronze box was placed beneath the monument. Included in the capsule were copies of each daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.; an American flag; and one of each American silver coin in circulation, and a copy of Theodore Roosevelt's book, The Rough Riders in Cuba, autographed by President Roosevelt, the Reverend Doctor Denis J. Stafford, rector of St. Patrick's Catholic Church of Washington, D.C., Presidential Secretary William Loeb, Jr., and members of the memorial committee. =Dedication= North panel of the memorial, showing names of the dead. The unveiling and dedication ceremony for the Rough Riders Memorial was at 4:30 P.M. on April 12, 1907. The Rough Riders Monument Society formed a committee to plan the event, and Major General George H. Harries assisted with the planning and acted as master of ceremonies. In attendance were three batteries from the U.S. Light Field Artillery, a squad of mounted soldiers from the 13th Cavalry, three companies of the District of Columbia Army National Guard, and part of a company of the D.C. Naval National Guard. Music was provided by the 13th Cavalry Band; the Engineers' Band from the Washington Navy Yard; and the Brigade Band of the District of Columbia National Guard. At the time, seven Rough Riders were buried in the far western edge of what is now Section 22 (along McPherson Avenue). These graves were strewn with yellow and white flowers, the colors of the regiment. A 21-gun salute by the artillery welcomed President Roosevelt, who was accompanied by Lieutenant General S. B. M. Young (the recently retired Chief of Staff of the United States Army) and Major General Frank McCoy (his military aide). Each band played a musical selection, and Rev. Henry A. Brown provided the invocation. The crowd sang Nearer, My God, to Thee and then Mrs. Capron unveiled the memorial as the bands played The Star Spangled Banner. President Roosevelt spoke at length about patriotism and duty, and then the Rev. Dr. Stafford provided an oration on virtue. After several more musical pieces by the bands, Rev. Brown gave the benediction. Taps was played by a bugler, and another 21-gun salute closed the ceremony. Those attending included all Cabinet officers; Lieutenant General Adna Chaffee, the incumbent Army Chief of Staff; Secretary of the Navy Victor H. Metcalf; Major General George F. Elliott, Commandant of the Marine Corps; Rear Admiral William S. Cowles; Presidential secretary Loeb; Brigadier General J. Franklin Bell; Assistant Secretary of War Robert Shaw Oliver; Assistant Secretary of the Navy Truman Newberry; the Commissioners of the District of Columbia; and the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard. Many former Rough Riders were also present, as well as representatives of the Spanish War Veterans, Army and Navy Union, Grand Army of the Republic, Society of the Army of the Tennessee, Oldest Inhabitants of the District of Columbia, United Confederate Veterans, Daughters of the American Revolution, George Washington Memorial Association, Sons of the Revolution, Union Veteran Legion, Loyal Legion, and Washington National Monument Society. Foreign dignitaries present included Jean Jules Jusserand, French ambassador to the United States; Baron Rosen, Imperial Russian ambassador to the United States; ambassadors from Brazil, Denmark, Japan, Norway, Panama, Thailand, and the United Kingdom; and the military attachés from the Embassy of Germany and Embassy of Japan. About the memorial The Rough Riders Memorial is constructed of a grey granite block tall and quarried near Barre, Vermont.One source gives the height as . See: \\"Rough Riders' Shaft.\\" Washington Post. March 28, 1907. In design, it is very similar to the Rough Rider monument erected at Las Guasimas in Cuba. The obelisk-like memorial is rough-hewn everywhere, except for the panels on the north, south, and east faces where the names of the dead are carved. Near the top of the front (western face) of the memorial is a smooth bar of granite, on which the words \\"ROUGH RIDERS'\\" is carved in bas-relief. Below this is a rectangular dark bronze plaque whose edges are ornamented with laurel leaves (a symbol of victory). At the top of the plaque is a bar which bears the name of the regiment (\\"1st. U.S. Vol. Cav.\\"). Below that are outspread wings, over which two sabres are crossed. Appearing to hang from the sabres is the regimental insignia. An \\"RR\\" (for Rough Riders\\") is inscribed on the insignia, and the name of the three major battles in which the unit fought (Las Guasimas, San Juan Hill, Santiago) ring the emblem. The text on tablet reads: :In memory of :The deceased members :of the 1st U.S. :Volunteer Cavalry, :Spanish–American War :Erected by the members and :friends of the regiment. :1906. At the time of its unveiling, the names of more than 100 men had been cut into it. The total cost of the Rough Riders Memorial was $2,500 ($ in dollars). The Rough Rider Monument Society planned to have the names of members of the regiment inscribed on the monument as they died, and established a self-sustaining fund to pay for this. The raising of money for the inscription fund continued long after the memorial's dedication. The monument society owed more than $1,000 ($ in dollars) for construction of the memorial.\\"President Donates $100.\\" Washington Post. December 12, 1907. Another display of military horsemanship by the 13th Cavalry and 4th Field Artillery Battery occurred in December 1907.\\"For Rough Rider Monument.\\" Washington Post. December 8, 1907. President Roosevelt donated $100 ($ in dollars) at the event to help dissipate the debt. Another memorial fund-raiser, also attended by President Roosevelt, was held in April 1908.\\"For Rough Rider Monument.\\" Washington Post. April 27, 1908. At the funeral of General Leonard Wood in August 1927, the approximately 400 living Rough Riders gathered for an informal reunion at Arlington National Cemetery. For many, it was the first time they had seen the Rough Riders Memorial.Gallagher, Patrick. \\"Only 400 Survive of 1,360 Who Fought With Rough Riders.\\" Washington Post. August 14, 1927. The memorial's bronze tablet and inscriptions were cleaned and conserved in the early 2000s by Gordon Ponsford, a restorer who also worked on the cemetery's McClellan Gate and Confederate Memorial.O'Keefe, Ed. \\"Memorable Words Becoming More Visible.\\" Washington Post. October 29, 2010. Accessed June 7, 2013. =Dedication date= The Rough Riders Memorial in 1912. Incorrect information about the date of the Rough Rider Memorial's dedication is common. This may be because the bronze plaque on the front of the memorial says 1906. Arlington National Cemetery and a number of secondary sources (largely written by historians of the cemetery) claim the monument was dedicated in 1906. One source even claims it was erected in 1905. Contemporary newspaper accounts are clear that the memorial was dedicated on April 12, 1907. President Roosevelt's own published collection of major speeches notes that the date of dedication was April 12, 1907.p. 339. Accessed June 22, 2013. Other historians note that the Rough Rider Memorial in Prescott, Arizona, was dedicated the same year (1907) as the Rough Riders Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery.Quesadas, p. 69. The Washington Post reported on March 28, 1907, that the memorial's bronze tablet said \\"1906\\". References Bibliography *Atkinson, Rick. Where Valor Rests: Arlington National Cemetery.

Official Website of the DIPLOMAT CHESS Game It is played on a circular board with 43 cells, including the center circle which is considered orthogonal and diagonal to every adjacent cell. The game includes a fairy piece called 'diplomat' which instead of capturing can suborn enemy pieces. The Chess Variant Pages A diplomat chess game (with queen pieces used as diplomats).  Rules  The game is won by checkmating or stalemating the enemy king. When one position is repeated three times, the games is automatically declared a draw. The same happens when both kings are the only remaining pieces on the board. = Setup = The board consists of three concentric circles with 14 cells each and a center cell. The pieces are identical to those in orthodox chess with the following exceptions: An extra piece called the diplomat is added. The horse is the same as the knight in orthodox chess. There is no queen. A diplomat chess board with coordinates White: * King on d1 * Rook on e1 * Diplomat on f1 * Bishop on c1 * Horse (knight) on b1 * Pawns on b2, c2, d2, e2 and f2. Black: * King on k1 * Rook on l1 * Diplomat on m1 * Bishop on j1 * Horse (knight) on i1 * Pawns on i2, j2, k2, l2 and m2. = Movement = White moves first. In general, the pieces move as in orthodox chess, with the center (cell 4) being considered orthogonal and diagonal to every adjacent cell. Pawn movement Pawns move one step orthogonally forward and capture to one step diagonally forward, as in orthodox chess. A movement \\"forward\\" can be defined as one that places the pawn closer to the starting cell of its enemy king. Then pawns can capture to the sides of the cells they can move to. There is no double move and no en passant move. Rook movement Bishop movement The rook, bishop, horse (knight) and king move as in orthodox chess. The movement through the center is illustrated by the figure. From the center, a rook and a bishop can reach any square on the board. A horse in the center can reach any square in the two inner rows (2 and 3). The rook is not allowed to do a \\"null move\\", i.e. to move 360° around the board back to the same square in one move. The diplomat moves as a king, but can only move to unoccupied cells. The diplomat can not capture. Instead, it can suborn an enemy pieces on an adjacent cell, making them change sides. The enemy piece is replaced by the same kind of piece of the friendly color. The diplomat remains on the same cell when it suborns an enemy piece. The diplomat can suborn any enemy piece except the king. In notation, suborn is represented by the destination cell, followed by the equal symbol (=) and then the colour the suborned piece changes to, alternatively only one letter: b for black and w for white. Example: b3=b for 'the piece on b3 becomes black'. (There is no need of writing the letter D for the diplomat).

The area that in 1809 became Finland was a group of integral provinces of the Kingdom of Sweden for over 600 years, signifying that also women in Finland were allowed to vote during the Swedish Age of Liberty (1718–1772), when suffrage was granted to tax- paying female members of guildsÅsa Karlsson-Sjögren: Männen, kvinnorna och rösträtten : medborgarskap och representation 1723–1866 (\\"Men, women and the vote: citizenship and representation 1723–1866\\") (in Swedish) The predecessor state of modern Finland, the Grand Duchy of Finland was part of the Russian Empire from 1809 to 1917 and enjoyed a high degree of autonomy. In 1863 taxpaying women were granted municipal suffrage in the countryside, and in 1872, the same reform was given to the citiesP. Orman Ray: Woman Suffrage in Foreign Countries. The American Political Science Review. Vol. 12, No. 3 (Aug., 1918), pp. 469-474 The Parliament Act in 1906 established the unicameral parliament of Finland and both women and men were given the right to vote and stand for election. Thus Finnish women became the first in the world to have unrestricted rights both to vote and to stand for parliament. In elections the next year, 19 female MPs, first ones in the world, were elected and women have continued to play a central role in the nation's politics ever since. Miina Sillanpää, a key figure in the worker's movement, became the first female minister in 1926. Finland's first female President Tarja Halonen was voted into office in 2000 and for a second term in 2006. Since the 2011 parliamentary election, women's representation stands at 42,5%. In 2003 Anneli Jäätteenmäki became the first female Prime Minister of Finland, and in 2007 Matti Vanhanen's second cabinet made history as for the first time there were more women than men in the cabinet of Finland (12 vs. 8).  Women's Rights Movement  In 1970 there was a brief but strong women's movement. Rape in marriage was not considered a crime at the time, and victims of domestic violence had few places to go. Feminists also fought for a day-care system that would be open to the public, and for the right for not only paid maternity leave but also paternity leave. Today there is a 263-day parental leave in Finland. It is illegal to discriminate against women in the workforce. Two feminist groups were created to help the movement: The Marxist- Feminists and the Red Women. The feminists in Finland were inspired by other European countries such as Sweden and Switzerland. Other important groups for the Finnish women in the 1970s include \\"Unioni\\" and \\"The Feminists\\" = Women’s rights = Finland became one of the first countries to grant women the right to vote, and still today they are among the top countries for women equality. \\"Finland was voted second in the Global Gender Gap Index in women’s rights.\\" Finland made marital rape illegal in 1994. In 2003 the government of Finland proposed addressing issues with gender inequality. They planned to promote gender equality over the entire public administration, reform the Act on Equality that the men and women in Finland share, promote equal pay for work of equal value, increase the number of women in political and economic roles, assessing gender equality from the male point of view, prevent domestic violence and intimate partner violence, protect victims of trafficking and the possibility of criminalizing buying sex. This act is called the Government Action Plan for Gender Equality and it included more than 100 issues that needed discussion.  Education  = In History = In the late 18th century and early 19th century private schools for girls were established in Finland, among the more known being those of Christina Krook, Anna Salmberg and Sara Wacklin. These schools were criticized for its shallow education of accomplishments, which resulted in the decision that girls should be included in the school reform of 1843, and the following year, two Swedish-language state schools for girls was founded in Turku and Helsinki, Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Åbo and Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Helsingfors.Siegberg, Arthur: Den högre kvinnobildningen i Finland, dess utveckling och mål., W. C. Fabritius & Sonner, Kr.a. This led to the establishment of a net of girl schools of a similar kind in Finland. At first the schools were reserved for girls from upper-class families. At this time it was not possible for the girls to pass the baccalaureate and move on to university studies. In 1865 a grammar school made it clear that only girls whose upbringing and manners were impeccable and whose company cannot be considered detrimental to others, and who were from \\"respectable\\" families could be in the school. After the first woman in Finland, Maria Tschetschulin, was accepted as a university student by dispensation in 1870, advanced classes and colleges classes were included in many girl schools to prepare students for university (by means of dispensation), and in 1872, the demand that all students must be members of the Swedish language upper classes was dropped. Women were given the right to teach in grammar schools for girls in 1882. When the dispensation for female university students was dropped and women were accepted at the same terms as men in 1915, girls and boys started to receive the same education in the school system, and the girl schools in Finland started to be changed to same sex education, a development which was completed in the 1970s. = Today = Finland students start their schooling a year after a lot of other countries. In spite of this, Finland is now one of the top-performing countries in mathematical skills, but also one of the few whose boys performed as well as girls. While in most countries the most able girls lag behind the most able boys in mathematics performance, according to the PISA 2012 Results Overview, the OECD gender score difference in mathematics, reading, and science was a result of -6 (boys - girls) in Finland. Additionally, while the highest- performing students of problem solving in the world are largely males, Finland makes an exception where the proportion of top-performing females is about the same as the proportion of top-performing males. This is also true among the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) where the top-performers in problem solving are predominantly men, except for in Finland, Australia and Canada. As for Finland's educational benefits for students, Finnish schools offer state- funded schooling which makes it easier for women and men to go to work after being on parental leave. Women represent 32% of students studying in mathematics and computer science.  Women in the Workforce  According to the Finnish Labor Force Survey around 32% of the 301,000 people who are self- employed are women. Women first became involved in labor markets through agrarian societies. Even before the public daycare systems, the number of women in the workforce was still very high, over 50%. The number of workers in the labor force that makes up the females (ages 15–74) is 51%, where men is 49%. 32% of the women are involved in entrepreneurship. = Equality in the workforce = Employers who have at least 30 employees must have a gender equality plan that includes a women's and men's pay comparison. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and other important labor market organizations set guidelines for gender equality planning.  Women in the Military  Military service is required for men in Finland, but is voluntary for women. Women who enlist are allowed to train for combat roles. Finland is one of 16 other countries in the world that permit women in front-line combat positions.

Allegedly falsifying his castration in order to gain entry into the court of Qin, he became the favorite of Queen Dowager Zhao, the mother of Qin Shi Huang, later the First Emperor of China. He was enfeoffed as Marquis of Changxin (長信侯). After a conspiracy to incite rebellion was uncovered, he was executed by Qin Shi Huang. Since the conspiracy and downfall of Lao Ai, his sexual misdeeds have become a fixture in the traditional moralizing discourse of intellectuals in imperial China, and his very name, which signifies \\"lustful misdeed\\" in Old Chinese, has become a byword for illicit sexual relationships in the classical Chinese language.Kangxi Dictionary entry for Aì: \\"[...]故世罵淫曰嫪毐\\". Biography According to Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian, Lao Ai had a giant penis, being of such size that it could be used as an axle for a wooden carriage. This ability drew the attention of Lü Buwei, who was having an affair with Queen Dowager Zhao, mother to King Zheng of Qin (later Qin Shi Huang), and Lü plotted to make use of Lao's sexual prowess to ingratiate himself with the Queen Dowager. During the formative years of King Zheng's reign, Lü Buwei ended his affair with the Queen Dowager and gave Lao Ai to her. Lü and the Queen organised a false castration in order to facilitate Lao Ai's admission to the Queen's palace as a eunuch. After moving to the provisional capital Yong, Lao Ai fathered two children, and gave himself the diminutive \\"false father\\". Lao Ai profited from his status and gathered over one thousand servants and followers. In 238 BCE, following the royal proclamation announcing Lao Ai's status as an imposter lover consorting with the Queen Dowager, with plans to secretly father the next king, Lao Ai was investigated. During this time, he attempted a coup d'état with a small number of followers, using the Queen Dowager's seal to gain legitimacy. Without popular support, military training, numbers or sufficient organisation, Lao Ai's followers were quickly defeated. Lao Ai was punished by being dismembered and torn apart by five horses and the Queen Dowager was imprisoned in her palace and her two sons were killed. Followers were exiled to the former state of Shu. Historicity The historicity of Lao Ai has been doubted by modern historians, who consider that Confucian ideologues, who were in favor with the Han court during the composition of the Records of the Grand Historian, had the ulterior motive of portraying Qin Shi Huang, a foe of Confucians who had ordered their mass execution in 212 BCE, as a bastard. Supporters of this theory point out that Lao Ai's name appears etymologically fanciful: the characters used to write Lao Ai literally mean \\"lustful misdeed\\" in Old Chinese, and that his defining characteristic, his large penis (in Chinese ), can also be taken to mean \\"great conspiracy\\". Given that Sima Qian, author of the historical work that canonized this traditional account of Lao Ai, was himself subject to the punishment of castration some years before, skeptically minded historians believe that the story of Lao Ai is meant to be understood allegorically, as a \\"personified phallus\\" who represented \\"a basic threat to the transmission of the imperial bloodline and hence the purity of the 'united cosmos.'\\" Popular culture In Manga Kingdom, he was given to Lady Zhao as Lü Buwei's \\"gift\\" to her. He joined the coup, as King of Ai, their own \\"state\\" and tried to eliminate Qin, reluctantly leading the bloodthirsty Qin traitor Fan Wuji and other generals. He was caught in the disastrous retreat, and executed in the aftermath.

It is defined by its dark, violent, nihilistic lyrical content and ominous trap-influenced beats. Drill progressed into the American mainstream in mid-2012 following the success of rappers and producers like Young Chop, Chief Keef, Lil Durk, Fredo Santana, SD and Lil Reese, who had many local fans and a significant Internet presence. Media attention and the signing of drill musicians to major labels followed. Artists within the genre have been noted for their style of lyricism and association with crime in Chicago. A regional subgenre, UK drill, emerged in London, particularly in the district of Brixton, beginning in 2012. UK drill rose to prominence by the mid-2010s and has influenced the creation of other regional scenes, such as Australian, Irish and New York drill. Characteristics The lyrics of drill tend to be violent and very gritty. The Guardians Lucy Stehlik said \\"nihilistic drill reflects real life where its squeaky-clean hip-hop counterparts have failed.\\" Drill lyrics strongly contrast with the subject matter of earlier Chicago rappers and contemporary mainstream hip hop, which at the time of drill's emergence tended to glorify and celebrate a rise to wealth. Drill lyrics typically reflect life on the streets, and tend to be gritty, violent, realistic and nihilistic. Drill rappers use a grim, deadpan delivery, often filtered through Auto-Tune, influenced by the \\"stoned, aimless warbling of Soulja Boy (one of the earliest non-local Keef collaborators) and Lil Wayne before him.\\" Atlanta-based rappers Gucci Mane and Waka Flocka Flame were important influences on the drill scene. Though it bears many similarities to trap music, the speed of a drill beat is generally slower with a moderate tempo, having about 60 to 70 beats per minute. Some producers work at double tempo, such as 130 to 140 beats per minute. Drillers tend to be young; many prominent musicians in the scene started getting attention while still in their teens. One of the genre's most prominent musicians, Chief Keef, was 16 when he signed a multi-million dollar record contract with Interscope, and in an extreme example, Lil Wayne co-signed the 13-year-old driller Lil Mouse. Critics have noted drill rappers' lack of concern with metaphor or wordplay. Chief Keef said that his simplistic flow is a conscious stylistic choice: \\"I know what I'm doing. I mastered it. And I don't even really use metaphors or punchlines. 'Cause I don't have to. But I could. ... I think that's doing too much. I'd rather just say what's going on right now. ... I don't really like metaphors or punchlines like that.\\" What Moser wrote that Keef's songs are \\"lyrically, rhythmically , and emotionally diminished, which is why they sound so airless and claustrophobic ... It's not even fatalistic, because that would imply a self-consciousness, a moral consideration, that isn't there in the lyrics. It just is, over and over again.\\" A profile on the scene in The New York Times examined the genre's aggression: > With rare exception this music is unmediated and raw and without bright > spots, focused on anger and violence. The instinct is to call this tough, > unforgiving and concrete-hard music joyless, but in truth it's exuberant in > its darkness. Most of its practitioners are young and coming into their > creative own against a backdrop of outrageous violence in Chicago, > particularly among young people—dozens of teenagers have been killed in > Chicago this year—and often related to gangs. (There's a long history of > overlap between Chicago’s gangs and Chicago’s rap.) That their music is a > symphony of ill-tempered threats shouldn't be a surprise. Female artists have been represented in the scene since its origins. Pitchforks Miles Raymer said \\"instead of rapping about being a 'hitta'—the local term for a shooter—they rapped about being in love with hittas. Otherwise, they rode the same kind of icily sociopathic beats from the same producers as any other drill rappers, and came across as equally tough.\\" Female drillers mix themes of violence and love in their songs, and Katie Got Bandz said, \\"It's different because males wouldn't expect a female to rap about drilling. They're used to females selling themselves.\\" Stehlik called drill production style the \\"sonic cousin to skittish footwork, southern-fried hip-hop and the 808 trigger-finger of trap.\\" Young Chop is frequently identified by critics as the genre's most characteristic producer. The sound of trap producer Lex Luger's music is a major influence on drill, and Young Chop identified Shawty Redd, Drumma Boy, and Zaytoven as important precursors to drill. History David Drake of Complex said drill is not defined by any particular production style, but \\"is about the entirety of the culture: the lingo, the dances, the mentality, and the music, much of which originated in 'Dro City', a gang-defined territory of city blocks in the Woodlawn neighborhood.\\" In street slang, \\"drill\\" means to fight or retaliate, and \\"can be used for anything from females getting dolled up to all out war in the streets.\\" Dro City rapper Pacman, considered the stylistic originator of the genre, is credited as the first to apply the term to the local hip hop music. Drake described the drill scene as a major vehicle of the early 2010s rise of Chicago hip hop, and described the scene as \\"a grassroots movement that had incubated in a closed, interlocking system: on the streets and through social media, in a network of clubs and parties, and amongst high schools.\\" Drill developed on the South Side of Chicago, in the midst of escalating violence and a homicide crisis. Mark Guarino wrote for Salon that the music grew during \\"a shift from historic feuding between monolithic crime organizations controlling thousands of members each to intrapersonal squabbling and retaliatory conflicts among smaller hybrid groups whose control extends just a few blocks... The toughened reality of living in these neighborhoods is what shaped Drill music.\\" In the drill scene, rap conflict and gang conflict overlap, and many of the young rappers come from backgrounds with experience of violence. The Independents Sam Gould wrote that Chief Keef \\"represents both a scary strain of current hip hop culture and a seriously alienated group within American society.\\" By late 2012, rappers from other scenes and hip hop stars like Kanye West, Drake and Rick Ross were collaborating with drill musicians. Kanye West remixed \\"I Don't Like\\" for the 2012 GOOD Music compilation Cruel Summer as \\"Don't Like\\", with features from West, Chief Keef, Pusha T, Big Sean and Jadakiss. West cited drill as an influence on his 2013 album Yeezus, and Chief Keef and King Louie had vocals featured on the album. Drill's subject matter strongly contrasts with that of earlier Chicago rappers such as Kid Sister, Lupe Fiasco, Psalm One, Rhymefest and The Cool Kids, Older Chicago rappers have been mixed in their reaction to drill's popularity and violence. In a radio interview, socially conscious hip hop rapper Lupe Fiasco said \\"Chief Keef scares me. Not him specifically, but just the culture that he represents ... The murder rate in Chicago is skyrocketing, and you see who's doing it and perpetrating it—they all look like Chief Keef.\\" After Chief Keef threatened Fiasco on Twitter, Fiasco said he was considering quitting the music scene. Rhymefest tweeted that drill is \\"the theme music to murder.\\" While drill music of Chicago fizzled out of mainstream popularity, a new scene was emerging in the UK and by the late-2010s was gaining mainstream popularity, spreading across Europe, influencing the creation of drill scenes around the continent. UK drill music evolved its own distinct style of production compared to Chicago drill. The mid 2010s saw the emergence of Brooklyn drill which was almost completely influenced by Chicago with acts such as Bobby Shmurda and Rowdy Rebel, while the late 2010s saw a emergence of prominent drill artists from Brooklyn, New York, such as Pop Smoke, 22Gz, Sheff G, Fivio Foreign, Sleepy Hallow, Curly Savv, Fetty Luciano, Blizz Vito and Blixky Boyz. Later Brooklyn drill production is heavily influenced by drill from the UK, with artists such as Fivio Foreign, Sheff G, Smoove’L, Blizz Vito, 22Gz and Pop Smoke collaborating with UK drill producers such as 808Melo, Ghosty, Yoz Beats and AXL Beats. Pop Smoke's song \\"Welcome to the Party\\", produced by 808Melo, was a prominent release in 2019, and saw remixes from Nicki Minaj, Meek Mill and British MC Skepta. Sheff G's \\"No Suburban\\" (released in 2017) and 22Gz's \\"Suburban\\" (released in 2016) have been credited for bringing attention to later Brooklyn drill.  UK drill  UK drill is a subgenre of drill music and road rap that originated in the South London district of Brixton from 2012 onwards. Influenced by style of Chicago drill music, UK drill artists often rap about violent and hedonistic criminal lifestyles. Typically, those that create this style of music are affiliated with gangs or come from socioeconomically-deprived neighborhoods where crime is a way of life for many. UK drill music is heavily related to road rap, a British style of gangsta rap that became popular in the years prior to the existence of drill. Musically, UK drill often exhibits violent language, variety of lyrical delivery, and the fierce rivalries that came with it. Notable pioneers include the postal-code crews 150, 67 (both based in or around Brixton) and 86. Since 2016, more modern groups have emerged such as 814, Silwood Nation, Block 6, Y.ACG, Zone 2, BSide, Moscow17, CGM (Formerly 1011), 12World, SMG, OFB, NPK and the Harlem Spartans. UK drill groups relied on internet platforms to distribute their music, particularly on YouTube, where platforms such as Link-Up TV, GRM Daily, SB.TV, Mixtape Madness, PacMan TV and PressPlay Media have helped various groups amass thousands, sometimes millions, of views. UK drill has developed a different production style than Chicago drill, taking influence from earlier British genres such as grime and UK garage, so much so that it has been called \\"the New Grime\\" and drill producer Carns Hill has commented that it needs a new name. However, Mazza, a UK drill producer, disagreed with the \\"new grime\\" label, maintaining that although drill and grime share the same energy, rawness and originated in a similar fashion, the two genres are distinct in their own ways. UK drill is generally more fast-paced compared to its Chicago counterpart. Instrumentals often also have a sliding bass, hard hitting kicks and dark melodies. AXL Beats explained that the 808's and fast-tempo snares are derivative of grime music. Both genres typically utilize a tempo of approximately 140 bpm. UK drill groups often engage in disputes with each other, sometimes violent, often releasing multiple diss tracks. Notable disputes include Zone 2 versus Moscow 17, 150 versus 67 OFB/NPK versus WG/N9 and SMG versus 814 (a member of 814, Showkey, was stabbed to death in 2016 in an unrelated incident). UK drill received worldwide attention in 2017 when comedian Michael Dapaah released the novelty song \\"Man's Not Hot\\". The track samples a beat made by UK drill producers GottiOnEm and Mazza; it was first used by drill group 86 on its song \\"Lurk\\" and later 67 with \\"Let's Lurk\\" featuring Giggs. = Legal action = Some London public officials have criticized UK drill and the culture surrounding it, arguing that it has encouraged violent crime. Detective Superintendent Mike West stated that \\"there are gestures of violence [in UK drill music videos], with hand signals suggesting they are firing weapons and graphic descriptions of what they would do to each other.\\" In 2017, then 17-year-old rapper Junior Simpson (known as M-Trap), who had written lyrics about knife attacks, was part of a group of people that stabbed a 15-year-old boy to death, for which he received a life sentence. Judge Anthony Leonard QC told Simpson, \\"You suggested [the lyrics] were just for show but I do not believe that, and I suspect you were waiting for the right opportunity for an attack.\\" In 2018, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick named UK drill as one of the reasons for a rise in the rate of knife attacks in London and urged large internet companies to remove content that \\"glamourises violence\\". In May of that year, YouTube reported that it had removed more than half of the music videos that she had asked the platform to delete; she identified them as causes of violent crime in London. More than 30 videos had been removed in total. Later that same year, South London-born drill MC and aspiring Mayor of London Drillminister released a track called 'Political Drillin' which was broadcast on Channel 4 News and subsequently went viral, using UK MP's comments in a bid to highlight the hypocrisy of their own violent language. In July 2019, YouTube decided it would no longer be taking down UK drill videos on YouTube. In June 2018, in what was described as a legally unprecedented move, the members of the UK drill group 1011 were prohibited by court order from mentioning injury or death in their music, and from mentioning certain postcodes in a \\"gang context\\". The order also requires them to notify police within 24 hours of releasing a new video, provide 48 hours' notice of the date and location of any of their performances or recordings, and allow police officers to attend them. The order was criticized by many, including by Jodie Ginsberg, Chief Executive of the campaign group Index on Censorship, who said \\"Banning a kind of music is not the way to handle ideas or opinions that are distasteful or disturbing\\" and \\"This isn't going to address the issues that lead to the creation of this kind of music.\\" In June 2018, Victor Maibvisira was one of five members of a gang who were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, having stabbed Kyle Yule to death in Gillingham, Kent, in October 2017. Whilst he was on remand, a drill video featuring him rapping about knife crime and gangs was put online. = International spread = UK drill's production style has spread outside of the United Kingdom, with artists and groups in other countries rapping in styles and using production heavily influenced by UK drill music, as well as co-opting British slang common in UK drill music. British producers have managed to export the sound by producing for artists in other nations. Ireland, the Netherlands and Australia in particular have developed drill scenes that are heavily indebted to UK drill music, with artists such as OneFour in Australia, Chuks & J.B2 from Dublin, Ireland and 73 De Pijp from the Netherlands. The style has also spread to New York City, where artists such as Sheff G, 22Gz and Pop Smoke have collaborated with UK drill producers. Artists in Spain making drill music have also taken on influence by its British counterpart, with various references and similar production to UK drill. Canadian musician Drake did a \\"Behind Barz\\" freestyle for Link Up TV in 2018 where he rapped over a UK drill beat. Drake also credited UK drill artist Loski as an influence for his 2018 album, Scorpion. In 2019, Drake released \\"War\\". The song used UK drill's production style and was produced by British producer AXL Beats. Drake's flow in both instances was reminiscent of UK drill artists, and the production style is rapidly becoming popular among other artists from the Toronto area prompting speculations that a new hybrid subgenre of drill music combining American and UK elements can emerge from Canada.  Influence  Drill lyrics often convey aggressive themes, evident in some of the genre's music videos, which may cause the style to be regarded as a negative influence. Some key public figures have attempted to link drill music with violent behavior among London youths. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick successfully petitioned YouTube to remove 30 drill videos in 2018. On July 25, 2015, police shut down a concert featuring Chief Keef, a rapper who helped popularize drill music in the US. Though the concert was a benefit for the families of Dillan Harris and Marvin Carr, a toddler and a 22-year-old man who were killed on July 11, it was considered a threat to public safety. The purported linkage between drill music and increasing crime rates is controversial. UK drill rapper Drillminister has disputed the claim of a knife-attack victim who accused the genre of inciting violent behavior. Drillminister explained that many are quick to point the finger at drill music without understanding the circumstances. Many drill rappers use their life circumstances as subject matter for their lyrics. Daniel Levitin, a psychology professor at McGill University in Canada, has stated that other factors, such as people's personalities, that cause them to indulge in violence rather than being influenced by drill music, and that drill music may be enjoyed by non- violent listeners.

The Namantar Andolan was a 1978 to 1994 movement in India by Dalits (formerly known as Untouchables) who wanted to rename a university in honour of a leading Dalit, B. R. Ambedkar. The movement was vigorously opposed by members of the Hindu community. During 16 years of struggle, there were murders, torture, rapes, burning of colonies, poisoning of wells, property damage, boycotts and lockouts. In 2013, 19 years after the movement's success, the city government of Nagpur erected this monument in memory of the valour and the sacrifice of Dalit martyrs. Background The Dalits of India were on the bottom of the Indian caste system for millennia. In Hinduism, there are four varnas (classes) and in that system, the Dalits are below the lowest of them. Dalits were considered polluted and this pollution was considered contagious. They worked in jobs which were considered ritually impure, they were not allowed to enter Hindu temples, they had to draw their water from separate wells and they had to live outside of villages. Untouchability was outlawed in 1950, but despite the laws, discrimination continues today. In the early 20th century, one of the first Dalits to earn a college education was B. R. Ambedkar. Fighting discrimination, he attended Elphinstone College in Bombay, earned a master's degree from Columbia University in the United States and then earned a doctoral degree from the London School of Economics. The British Raj made education more available to Untouchables but discrimination continued. Ambedkar established hostels, schools and colleges which were open to Dalits. As part of the movement surrounding the independence of India from Britain, major social changes took place and Dr. B. R. Ambedkar was appointed to lead the committee to draft a new constitution for India. He proposed, and the new country passed into law, a wide range of civil liberties, including the legal abolition of untouchability. Many Indian universities were renamed after people like Ambedkar and those changes were welcomed with few arguments. The Dalit community in the state of Maharashtra proposed to rename Marathwada University in honour of Ambedkar. The chief minister, the legislature, and university leaders approved the change, but a storm of opposition arose among Hindus. On 27 July 1978 riots began and the name change was stopped. The riots affected 25,000 Dalits and at least 27 were killed, five by the police. The Namantar Andolan (Name Change Movement) continued for 16 years before the university was renamed Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University. Development Many organisations and political parties proposed the idea for a memorial late in the 1990s and worked for 12 years to see a memorial realized. In 2010, the government of Nagpur announced the decision to build the memorial. An initial proposed design unveiled in April 2011 was not considered acceptable because it did not represent the history of the Namantar Andolan. Many suggestions were given for the memorial's design. The final design was completed by sculptor Uday Gajbhiye. The monument The Namantar Shahid Smarak (English: Name Change Martyrdom Memorial) is located at Indora Bridge 10 on Kamptee Road, Nagpur. That location was selected because that is where Avinash Dongre, a child protesting in support of the Namantar Andolan, was shot in the head by police on 4 August 1978. Four others - Dilip Ramteke, Abdul Sattar, Roshan Borkar and Ratan Mendhe - also lost their lives nearby. The memorial has a total of 27 sculptures of Bhim Sainiks (Soldiers of Bhim) who died during the pogroms. They are shown in the act of their struggle. In addition to the sculptures, there are 27 plaques with the name of each person; the memorial also has a monolith to pay homage to the martyrs. Along with the monument, there is a mini-theater for plays and discussions and a nearby library with materials related to the history of the Namantar Andolan. The memorial was built by contractor Sunil Sharma on 2,225 m2 of land at a cost of 1.58 crore (approximately US$259,000). Because many Dalits had converted to Buddhism with B.R. Ambedkar, the choice of Buddha Jayanti (Buddha's Birthday) to inaugurate the monument was auspicious. Jogendra Kawade, the leader of the Namantar Long March, was present that day and he said: This memorial stands for a fight for the pride of the nation.

Description It is situated about east of Birdsville and north of Innamincka. The Diamantina River and several of its associated tributaries run through the property. The Diamantina overflow swamp is situated on Durrie, the swamp is a DIWA nationally important wetland. The property is owned by S. Kidman & Co. and occupies an area of in the Channel Country of far west Queensland. On an average season Durrie is stocked with 9,000 head of cattle. History The traditional owners of the area are the Karwali peoples who have lived in the area for tens of thousands of years. Karuwali (also known as Garuwali, Dieri) is a language of far western Queensland. The Karuwali language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Diamantina Shire Council, including the localities of Betoota and Haddon Corner. The property was established some time prior to 1897 when it was feared that ticks from cattle in the Northern Territory would infect the Queensland herd unless a quarantine line was formed. Durrie was taken up in around 1908 by William Naughton, a prominent pastoralist of the time, when it took up an area of who stocked it over the course of two years with 8,000 head of cattle. Kidman acquired Durrie in 1913 when he bought it from the Naughton Brothers. Durrie adjoined Monkira and Bluff Stations which were both already owned by Kidman. The area was struck by drought from 1913 to early 1915 resulting in the deaths of huge numbers of stock. Kidman estimated that he lost 60,000 head on his properties in the Channel Country like Durrie, Diamantina Lakes, Durham Downs, Morney Plains and Carrawilla. Airmail delivery to remote properties in outback South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland commenced in 1949. Durrie along with other remote properties including Mungerannie, Clifton Hills, Glengyle, Davenport Downs, Morney Plains, Mount Leonard, Mulka, Cordillo Downs, Tanbar, Durham Downs, Nappa Merrie, Lake Pure and Naryilco were also on the route. After heavy rains in 1950 the Diamantina floodwaters reached records levels and the homestead was inundated. The McAuley family who were living at the homestead had to seek higher ground. The family camped on a nearby sand-hill for a week until the floodwaters receded. Diamantina Overflow Swamp The swamp extends over long with a width of up to that falls within the Diamantina catchment covering a total area of . It is composed of floodplain, swamps and anastomosing channels of the Diamantina River composed of very deep grey cracking clays. The water in the swamp is fresh and remains wet well into the dry season. The major habitats found within the area include vast areas of lignum, Muehlenbeckia florulenta, open shrubland and of sedgeland dominated by Eleocharis between the lignum.

The memorial is located near Place Bellecour, the main square of Lyon. It was designed by Leonardo Basmadyian and includes 36 white concrete pieces supported by stones from Armenia. Poems of Kostan Zarian are written on the concrete pieces. The cost of the memorial is around 180,000 euros, over two-thirds of which was provided by the Armenian community of Lyon. The rest was given by the Lyon Municipality and actively supported by Mayor Gérard Collomb. Controversy Members of the Turkish community of France and local Turkish organizations protested the construction of the memorial. The Council of Turkish Culture Associations in Rhone-Alpes applied to the French court to overturn construction of the memorial, however, the court upheld the decision. On March 18, 2006, about 3,000 Turks organized a protest against the memorial. The local branch of the opposition Union for a Popular Movement also stood against the construction of the memorial. Vandalism On April 17, 2006, just a week before its official inauguration, the memorial was vandalized. Graffiti denying the fact of the genocide (\\"There was no genocide\\") were sprayed on the memorial. The memorial was again vandalized in August 2007. In March 2015, the memorial was vandalized with profane words spray-painted on its facade. Inauguration The memorial was officially inaugurated on April 24, 2006 on the 91st anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. Maximum security measures were taken on the day with over 200 national law enforcement officers (Brigade anti-criminalité, Direction centrale des renseignements généraux) and 25 municipal policemen guarding the surrounding area. The area was also closed for traffic. Up to 4,000 people, including the Armenian Ambassador in France marched to the memorial.

Background From a peak of 3,000 deaths per month in 2006–07, violence in Iraq decreased steadily for several years before beginning to rise again in 2012. In December 2012, Sunnis began to protest perceived mistreatment by the Shia-led government. The protests had been largely peaceful, but insurgents, emboldened by the war in neighboring Syria, stepped up attacks in the initial months of 2013. The number of attacks rose sharply after the Iraqi army raided a protest camp in Hawija on 23 April 2013. Overall, 712 people were killed in April according to UN figures, making it the nation's deadliest month in five years. Conditions continued to deteriorate in May when UNAMI reported at least 1,045 Iraqis were killed and another 2,397 wounded in acts of terrorism and acts of violence, making it the deadliest month in the country since April 2008. The attacks on 16 June occurred about a month after Iraq's deadliest week in almost 5 years, as a series of deadly bombings and shootings across the country killed at least 449 people and left 732 others injured between 15 May and 21 May. Attacks Unlike most of the violence in Iraq during previous months, the majority of deadly attacks took place in southern cities, where such incidents are relatively rare. In the city of Kut, a car bomb exploded in an industrial area early in the morning, killing 6 people and injuring 15 others. A second bombing outside the city killed 5 civilians and wounded another 12. In Najaf, at least 8 were killed and 29 injured after a bomb exploded at a local market. Other cities in the south were targeted as well - twin car bombs in the central area of Basra killed 6 and wounded 9, while similar attacks in Nasiriyah killed 2 and left 35 injured. A roadside blast in Hillah killed a civilian and wounded nine others. Other attacks were reported from the central and northern parts of the country, in addition to the bombings in the south. A suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest at a coffee shop in Baghdad's Amin neighborhood, leaving 11 dead and at least 25 others injured. Gunmen attacked an oil pipeline in Hatra, south of Mosul, killing 6 Iraqi Army soldiers and wounding five more. In Mosul itself, two separate blasts injured 9 people, including 6 soldiers. A roadside bomb and a subsequent car bombing left 5 civilians dead and 12 others injured in Madain, near Salman Pak. Two civilians were killed and nine injured in a bombing in Mahmoudiyah, while a blast in Tuz Khormato killed two police officers and injured another, and four people were injured in an attack near Mahaweel. Two government employees were abducted near Riyadh.

Historical  5-3-3 circa 1950. Yellow triangles are defensive linemen, yellow squares are linebackers, yellow circles are defensive backs The 5-3 is a defense that appeared in the 1930s due to the demands of the ever-improving passing attacks of the time, as well as innovations in the T formation (in 1933, pro football's passing rules were liberalized).Halas, pp. 167-170. One origin story is that of Steve Owen, coach of the New York Giants. He says he invented it to surprise the Bears in 1933.Owen, p. 178 He then goes on to say that the 5-3 was in part responsible for the division championships won by the Giants in 1933, 1934, and 1935.Owen, p. 179 By the late 1930s, the two standard defenses in college and the NFL were the 6-2 and the 5–3. The 5-3 was regarded as a pass defense, the 6-2 the run defense.Owen, p. 183. The usage of the 5–3 defense accelerated as the T formation became more popular and more effective.Zimmerman, The Past is Prelude. Dana Bible, in his 1947 coaching tome, called it the best defense against the T formation.Bible, p. 157. By 1950, the base defenses in the NFL were all five man line defenses, either the 5-3 or the 5-2 Eagle.Carroll et al., p. 465 Three teams known for their use of the 5-3-3 were the Cleveland Browns, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the San Francisco 49ers.Owen, p. 174.Tittle and Clark, Chapter 16. Paul Brown attributed his loss in the 1951 NFL Championship, in part, to an error in coverage in their three-man backfield.Brown and Clary, p. 220. By the later 1950s, the 5-3 had died out in the NFL, replaced by the 5-2 Eagle or the 4–3.Carroll et al. p. 465.Zimmerman, Thinking Man's, p. 128. Hardy Brown, a 5-3 middle linebacker for the 49ers, and one of the hardest hitting linebackers of his era, was unable to adapt to changing times, and was cut because he could not deal with the demands of the new 4-3 defense.  Modern Usage  Colleges tend to have less powerful passing games than professional football, and the use of three man backfields or an overshifted secondary is common practice. In the overshift, one of the safeties plays a monster or rover role, often moving to the strong side of the offensive formation to about linebacker depth.Wilkinson, pp. 71-73. As a consequence, a body of defenses has emerged that have 5 man lines, 2 linebackers and a monster or rover back. This rover is a hybrid player, expected to use a linebacker technique when runs are encountered, and act like a pass defender otherwise.Amorosi, p. 12. According to Homer Smith, former head coach of the Army football team, the origin of the overshift, which he called the inverted rotation, is obscure. He first observed it in 1958.Beech, Epilogue. However, as widely spread flankers would break the run contain methods of the day (e.g. the \\"four spoke\\" contain of the 5-2 Oklahoma), the inverted secondary became popular as a way to stop the rushing attack of formations like Earl Blaik's Lonely End.Jones and Wilkinson, Chapter 6. = 5-2 Monster = The kinds of defenses seen of this kind are varied. The best known is the 5-2 Monster, combining the 5-2 Oklahoma with the overshifted monster secondary.Wilkinson, pp. 71-73.Brown, Chris, The Monster Defense, Overload Blitzes, and Angle Stunts . April 17, 2012. Smart Football. retrieved June 27, 2013.

It is also spelled Lik according to the Cantonese pronunciation. It is listed 303rd in the Song Dynasty classic Hundred Family Surnames.Hundred Family Surnames. Origins Li is an ancient surname originating from present-day Henan province. According to traditional accounts recorded in the 9th-century Tang Dynasty text Yuanhe Xing Zuan, after Yu the Great founded the Xia Dynasty, he enfeoffed Juan, a descendant of the Yellow Emperor, at the settlement of Li (modern Licheng Village 郦城村, Neixiang County, Henan), establishing the . During the middle Spring and Autumn period, Li was conquered by the Jin state, one of the major powers of the period. The noble families of Li subsequently adopted the name of their former state as their surname. Another origin is the non-Chinese Xirong tribe of Lishan (驪山), who used Lishan as their surname, later shortened to Li. Han Dynasty During the Chu–Han Contention, the brothers Li Yiji and Li Shang helped Liu Bang defeat Xiang Yu to establish the Han Dynasty in 206 BC. Li Yiji was a close advisor to Liu Bang but was executed by Liu's enemies when he tried to persuade them to surrender. Li Shang was a great general who became one of the Prime Ministers of Han. He was enfeoffed at Quzhou and awarded the noble title Marquis of Quzhou (曲周侯). Li Shang is commonly revered as the founding ancestor of the Li surname. Later history During the Jin Dynasty (265–420), the Li clan of Xincai was famously prosperous. At the end of the Northern Song Dynasty, Li Hong (郦洪) was a general fighting the Jurchen invaders. His son, Li Lun (郦伦), served as the governor of Shaoxing (in modern Zhejiang province), and his family lived in nearby Zhuji. After Li Hong died in battle, Li Lun took two of his sons – Li Deyi (郦德一) and Li De'er (郦德二) – to bring his father's body home. On their way back, Li Hong died in Danyang (in modern Jiangsu province). Deyi and De'er buried the bodies of their father and grandfather, and decided to settle down in Danyang to guard their tombs. The Li descendants in both Zhuji and Danyang became prominent clans. By 1927 the genealogy book of the Danyang Li clan had recorded 27 generations.

Active from 1831 to 1939, it was one of the first five schools in Sweden to offer serious academic education and secondary education to female students. In 1870, it became the first gymnasium for females in Sweden, and in 1874, it became the first girls' school that was permitted to administer the Studentexamen to females.Evelina Wilhelmina Fahnehjelm, urn:sbl:15001, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Bengt Hildebrand.), hämtad 2015-05-11. History Anders Fryxell (1878) =Foundation= The Wallinska skolan was founded in 1831 by the historian Anders Fryxell upon suggestion by the bishop and writer Johan Olof Wallin. The school was founded out of intellectual discontent over the contemporary shallow education of females in the contemporary finishing schools, such as Bjurströmska pensionen . Wallin convinced Fryxell that girls should be educated \\"with higher ambitions than to learn to speak French and play the klavér\\", because also women had the right to serious studies, and that it would surely prove to be needed in the future, which is why they were in need of a school \\"similar to that of the state Gymnasium (school) for boys\\".Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & söner, Stockholm, 1914 =Pioneer institution= At the time of the introduction of compulsory elementary school for both genders in Sweden in 1842, it was one of only five schools in Sweden to provide serious academic secondary education to females, and it was the first of that kind in the capital: the others being Societetsskolan (1786), Fruntimmersföreningens flickskola (1815) and Kjellbergska flickskolan (1833) in Gothenburg, and Askersunds flickskola (1812) in Askersund. Of these five schools, Askersunds flickskola and Wallinska skolan were considered to offer the highest academic quality to their students, and the Wallinska skolan was the most progressive of them all.Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & söner, Stockholm, 1914 It was the fourth girls' school in Sweden and the first in the capital of Stockholm to give female students an almost equal education to that of boys, in accordance with a structured pedagogic method.Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & söner, Stockholm, 1914 It was not an uncontroversial project, but Anders Fryxell had, reportedly, \\"the, for a principal of a radical pioneer school, invaluable talent to be able to handle parents\\".Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & söner, Stockholm, 1914 Wallinska skolan was managed by two principals in parallel, one male and one female. Upon its foundation, the school had five teachers and a student number of 33: the subjects were Christianity, Swedish, German, natural science, French, history, handicrafts and drawing. It was partitioned in four classes with the two first divided in four home works groups and the two later classes in three. The course was expansive and scientifically developed for its time.Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & söner, Stockholm, 1914 The school year was long, with only a month's summer vacation and two weeks of Christmas vacation. The school gradually changed over the years by continuously adjusting itself to the contemporary progressive ideals of women's education, reforms which were generally controversial, but always introduced nonetheless.Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & söner, Stockholm, 1914 Wallinska skolan was to remain the only serious secondary education school for girls in the capital until the 1860s, when the Royal Seminary was founded and the other girls' schools in Stockholm, notably Åhlinska skolan which was founded by Karin Åhlin in 1847, started to reform into serious secondary schools. =University Preparation Institution= By two reforms in 1870 and 1873, women in Sweden were given access to university education. To make this possible, access to the other levels of education was necessary, and the same year, Wallinska skolan became the first gymnasium for females in Sweden: it formed its first gymnasium class in 1870, and two years later, the first of its students at this level, Johanna Levysohn, took her Studentexamen at the male Stockholm gymnasium.Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & söner, Stockholm, 1914 In 1874, because it met with the demands stated in the Girls' School Committee of 1866, Wallinska skolan was given governmental support. The same year, 1874, it became the first girls' school in Sweden to win the right to administer the studentexamen for its students. It was one of five girls' schools in Sweden to be given this right prior before 1900, followed by Ateneum för flickor (Ateneum for Girls), Lyceum för flickor (Lyceum for Girls) in 1882, Åhlinska skolan in 1894 and Tekla Åbergs högre läroverk för flickor in Malmö in 1898, the first outside the capital. The reforms of the 1870s signified a breakthrough for the school, by then known as \\"Wallinium\\": the number of students increased from 70–80 to 250 during the 1870s, and Wallinska skolan long became nationally known as \\"the school where you could take the studentexamen\\"Heckscher, Ebba, Några drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & söner, Stockholm, 1914 and continue to university. The progressive reforms and expansion during the later half of the 19th-century were credited to Evelina Fahnehjelm (principal 1872–1898), who was given the Ilis quorum in recognition. In 1914, the number of students were 373, and the number of teachers 35. =Dissolution= In 1939, the school was united with the Åhlinska skolan to the co-educational Wallin-Åhlinska gymnasiet (Wallin-Åhlin Gymnasium) as a result of the new educational reform. Notable students A great number of notable personalities have been students at the school during its existence. Among them were: Karolina Widerström, Rosalie Roos, Ellen Fries, Anne Charlotte Leffler, Emilia Broomé, Anna Paues, Ellen Roosval von Hallwyl, Ebba von Eckermann, Fredrique Paijkull, Lydia Wahlström, Maria Cederschiöld, Gulli Petrini, Dr. Ellen Sandelin, Anna Lisa Andersson, Hanna Rydh, Naima Sahlbom and Elsa Thulin.

Operation Car Wash showed central government members using the prerogatives of their public office for rent-seeking activities, ranging from political support to siphoning funds from state-owned corporation for personal gain. Specifically, mensalão typically referred to the practice of transferring taxpayer funds as monthly allowances to members of congress from other political parties in consideration for their support and votes in congress. Politicians used the state-owned and state-run oil company Petrobras to raise hundreds of millions of reais for political campaigns and personal enrichment. Corruption was cited among many issues that provoked the 2013 protests.What's REALLY behind the Brazilian riots? CNN June 14, 2013 Corruption reduced public investments in health, education, infrastructure, security, housing, among other essential rights, expanding social exclusion and inequality. Definition All types of corruption exist. Clientilism, cronyism and nepotism are widespread in Brazil, and many critics mention how some of the members of Brazilian Supreme Court are seen openly mingling with politicians. Bribery (called propina or suborno in Portuguese) is also rife in the police force and throughout the Brazilian bureaucracy. But one of the most common types of corruption in Brazil is embezzlement of public funds through overbilling, called ' in Portuguese (literally \\"super invoicing\\"). This technique allows individuals to enrich themselves, and also finance political campaigns (as seen in the Petrobras scandal), and is closely linked to public contracts with private enterprises. Construction is a prime example, in contracts to build roads, sewage, and public buildings. It is estimated that 30% of all Brazilian public funds are embezzled this way each year. Petrobras president Aldemir Bendine in 2015 estimated the company's losses to corruption scandals at $2 billion US. The company's stock declined, although it later began to recover. Measurement The scale of corruption in Brazil is immense, but largely under-reported in the media and historically not investigated, prosecuted or punished, so it is difficult to estimate just how large the problem is. The Car Wash (Lava Jato) investigation may be changing this trend. Corruption in Brazil increases the already enormous Brazilian shadow economy which some sources estimate at 16.1% of the gross domestic product, a number that probably needs to be adjusted up considerably if corruption as such is included as part of the shadow economy. Transparency International's 2016 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 79th place out of 176 countries. Political corruption Political corruption is considered to be widespread in Brazil. A series of sources documenting historical corruption have only recently started to be published, some of them with references up to Colonial times. A unique complex network analysis revealed associations between those involved in corruption scandals included not only active (elected and non-elected) politicians, but also companies, both state-owned and private companies which had been favored in selection processes for execution of large infrastructure projects, some of which were cited both in the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers. The complexity of such corruption networks has been compared to the mafia, drug traffic networks and terrorist networks. The practice of \\"superfaturamento\\"—overbilling—in Brazil is considered to be extremely common in contracts and purchases for public institutions. Recent examples have been reported in small primary schools where products like pencils and notebooks were bought with padded invoices, as well as in grand-scale construction projects roads, football stadiums (not least in connection with large scale events such as the Olympics and FIFA's World Cup). A particularly notable example is the city of Brasilia itself, which historians believe was systematically overpriced when built in the early 1960s. = Military Era = Little or no evidence of corruption was made public during the military dictatorship era (1964-1988). Recently, however, several cases have become increasingly public knowledge and have been reviewed in books including Elio Gaspari's series of historical analyses and in the news. Cases ranged from smuggling whiskey and luxury clothes to outright extortion of companies by military-appointed governors (e.g. in the state of Paraná), who illegally favored their companies in contractor licensing (e.g. Antonio Carlos Magalhães and Magnesita) and used public money to save their own companies from bankruptcy (e.g. Paulo Maluf and his wife Sylvia in the Lutfalla case). British documents pointed out a number of other cases which were suppressed in the 1970s referring to overpriced purchase of UK equipment for construction of ships in Brazil. = Sarney Government = With the fall of the military dictatorship, with the start of redemocratization process, accusations of corruption started to hit the news and receive attention, involving all levels of government, including then-president José Sarney, although the accusations ceased to be processed in the National Congress. The main accusations referred to overbilling and irregularities in public infrastructure projects in collaboration with private companies, such as the case of the Ferrovia Norte- Sul (Norte-Sul Railway). Sarney was also accused of practicing nepotism, favouring relatives and friends in radio and TV concessions. The dissatisfaction led part of the Partido do Movimento Democrático Brasileiro (PMDB) to leave and establish the Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira (PSDB). The apex of the political crisis occurred during the production of the new Constitution, at the Assembleia Nacional Constituinte de 1987, where the length of Sarney's government was put in check, and in the end kept at 5 years, as opposed to 4. A Parliamentary Investigation Commission (CPI) was started in 1988 to investigate the corruption accusations, and several requests for impeachment were filed. = Collor Government = One of the most notorious corruption scandals resulted in the fall of President Fernando Collor de Mello, the first Latin American president to suffer an actual impeachment process. The first accusations appeared in the second semester of Collor's government. The then-president of Petrobras, Luís Octávio da Motta Veiga, quit, alleging pressure from the former financial secretary of Collor's campaign, Paulo César Farias (\\"PC Farias\\"), and the president's brother-in- law, ambassador Marcos Coimbra, to offer loans to the airline company VASP, which had been recently privatized. In 1991 the First Lady Rosane Collor was accused of irregularities at the charity (LBA). In May 1992, Pedro Collor, the president's brother, accused PC Farias of illicit enrichment and being a \\"goon\\" for the president in his business in an interview to Veja. The scandals piled up until 1993, when another Parliament Investigation Committee (CPI) was established, which became popularly known as the \\"CPI do Orçamento\\", presided by then-senator Jarbas Passarinho. However, in 2014, the accusations were removed by the Supremo Tribunal Federal and Collor was exculpated. = Fernando Henrique Cardoso Government = Fernando Henrique Cardoso's government led by the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) was also hit by a series of corruption accusations, firstly regarding federal \\"help\\" offered to banks such Nacional and Econômico, and the creation of the Programa de Estímulo à Reestruturação e ao Fortalecimento do Sistema Financeiro Nacional (Proer). Many issues involved privatization of State companies. One of the people cited in accusations was former director of Banco do Brasil, Ricardo Sérgio de Oliveira, which was in charge of financial resources for FHC's campaign, and who would have favored business with a consortium formed with Telecom Itália and Daniel Dantas' Opportunity Asset bank. Phone call recordings were central to several accusations regarding PSDB. Conversations between the minister of Communications, Luiz Carlos Mendonça de Barros, and the then-president of the Brazilian Development Bank, BNDES, André Lara Resende, demonstrated efforts to benefit the Opportunity consortium. Probably the worst accusations referred to the purchase of Congressional votes to introduce a constitutional amendment to allow for reelection to Executive roles, namely the President. Telephone recordings made public by Folha de S.Paulo in 1997 revealed conversations between representative Ronivon Santiago (Progressistas Party - State of Acre) and a Senhor X, where Santiago reports to have received, along with another four representatives, 200 thousand reais to vote for the reelection amendment, which had been paid by the then-governor of the state o Acre, Orleir Cameli. By the end of 2000-2001, the attentions in FHC's government had moved from the corruption accusations to the energy crisis (\\"Crise do Apagão\\"), which happened right after the wave of blackouts started in 1999. The 1999 blackout was blamed on a lightning strike, although researchers at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) demonstrated the official version to not hold. FHC tried to awart a similar crisis in 2001 by imposing energy rationing. = Lula Government = While Lula was in office reports surfaced of payments made to deputies in return for a pledge to support the government with their votes in Congress. According to investigators more than a dozen construction companies bribed or gave kickbacks to corrupt politicians in return for profitable contracts with state-owned petroleum company Petrobras. Former president of Jose Aldemario Pinheiro and OAS executive Agenor Medeiros each were sentenced to 16 years incarceration on 6 August 2015. Three other OAS employees received shorter sentences. = Operation Car Wash = Operation Car Wash is an investigation being carried out by the Federal Police of Brazil, Curitiba Branch, and judicially ordered by Judge Sérgio Moro on March 17, 2014. Initially a money laundering investigation, it expanded to cover allegations of corruption at the state-owned oil company Petrobras, whose executives took kickbacks for awarding contracts to construction firms at inflated prices. The operation has issued more than a hundred search warrants, and ordered temporary and preventive detention and coercive measures in its investigation of a money laundering scheme suspected of moving more than \\" (approximately ) as of November 22, 2016. Because of the unusual nature of its actions, defendants' lawyers accuse the operation of \\"selectivity\\" and \\"partiality\\", and of being \\"a criminal case that violated minimum rules of defense for a large number of defendants\\".http://pradella.jusbrasil.com.br/noticias/297190364/leia-o- manifesto-dos-advogados-que-comparam-lava-jato-a-inquisicao Pradella, Thiago de Carvalho. Leia o manifesto dos advogados que comparam Lava Jato à Inquisição. JusBrasil. January, 2016. Throughout the investigation, former Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, who chaired the board of Petrobras from 2003 to 2010, denied knowledge of any wrongdoing The Brazilian Supreme Court authorized the investigation of 48 current and former legislators, including former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in March 2016. Operation Car Wash has resulted in the arrest of many important political figures, including: * Treasurer of the Workers' Party, João Vaccari Neto, arrested for receiving \\"irregular donations.\\" * Former Lula chief of staff José Dirceu, arrested for orchestrating a large part of the bribery. * Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies (lower house of the Congress of Brazil) Eduardo Cunha (PMDB-RJ), investigated for receiving more than US$40 million in kickbacks and bribes. * Former minister of mines and energy Edison Lobão is being investigated for taking more than US$50 million from Petrobras. * Former Brazilian President and current Senator Fernando Collor de Mello of the Christian-conservative Christian Labour Party, charged with corruption. * The Rodrigo Patto Sá Motta indicated his relative for the position of teacher in the UFMG.History and Theater in Brazil after 64  Legal framework  To counteract widespread corruption in the private and public sector, Brazil enacted the Clean Company Act 2014 (Law No. 12, 846), which held companies responsible for the corrupt practices of their employees and liable without a finding of fault. Bid rigging and fraud are prohibited in public procurement, as well as bribery of Brazilian public officials. If found guilty of corruption the companies can be suspended, dissolved or fined. In an article done by Global Compliance News, there is stress put on the difference between individuals and legal entities in Brazilian anti-corruption Law. Firstly, only individuals can be criminally punished if found guilty of bribery. Legal entities (i.e. companies and organizations) are punished through the use of judicial and administrative sanctions. During this process, if found guilty legal entities are subject to losing 0.1% to 20% of their gross revenue along with the removal of all public loans, assets, and government subsidies. Foreign public officials found guilty of corruption are liable to penalties and up to eight years of imprisonment, while at the same time being subject to any punishments placed on legal entities. However, in spite of all this, Brazilian legislation does not put a limit on hospitality expenses to officials; although any amount can be considered corrupt.  Ranking of corruption  Based on data released by the Superior Electoral Court, the Movement to Combat Electoral Corruption released a balance on 4 October 2007 with the parties that include the largest number of parliamentarians quashed by electoral corruption since 2000. The Brazilian Social Democracy Party appeared in third place on the list with 58 cases, behind only the Democrats and the Brazilian Democratic Movement. According to analysis released on 8 September 2012, of 317 Brazilian politicians who were barred from running in elections by the Clean Record Act the Brazilian Social Democracy Party has the largest number of barred candidates with 56 party members.  Opposition  Anti-corruption sentiment in Brazil is a common subject in politics, media, art and activism. During the democratic period in the country, the press could report corruption cases and the opposition against the corruption was adopted by virtually all Brazilians. A study found that corruption was seen as the country's biggest problem. = In politics = During the Fourth Brazilian Republic, Adhemar de Barros was appointed by the president Getúlio Vargas as governor of São Paulo. Ademar was accused of unjust enrichment and fired by Vargas, but was elected as governor of São Paulo by direct vote. The motto “He steals, but he also works” (“Rouba, mas faz”) was first attributed to Ademar, suggesting that a politician that builds a good government can be elected despite his electoral crimes. Various politicians opposed Adhemar and the corruption in the country; Jânio Quadros beat Adhemar in gubernatorial elections and was elected president, by accusing Juscelino Kubitscheck of taking advantage of the construction of Brasilia, to make a government characterized by embezzlement. Other politicians, like Levy Fidelix, inspired by Jânio, also made anti-corruption speeches in their electoral campaign. The theme was platformed in various electoral debates. = Between military = Positivism was a philosophy present in the military environment. Various prominent figures declared that the military coup in 1964, was in order to combat the corruption in the country. According to the military rulers, all civil politicians were selfish and corrupted; only the military could save the country. Even Jânio Quadros was a target of the regime's politics of persecution. After the return of democracy, political immunity was given to congressman, to avoid unfair persecution, like those of the dictatorship. This controversial law is the subject of debate, because possible corrupt politicians, when charged, can seek protection by only being tried by the Supreme Court Jair Bolsonaro, a former military officer and current president of republic, made controversial speeches against the establishment and parliamentarian forces. = By people = During the 2010s, several movements were created to combat political corruption, like the Free Brazil Movement. Movements like “Fora Collor” (Get-out, Collor) and “Fora Dilma” (Get-out, Dilma) were supported by popular masses. Military guerrillas stole money from Adhemar de Barros’ safe box during military dictatorship. = By political system = The three branches of power in Brazil were associated with corruption or with the protection of corrupt politicians. During the impeachment process of Fernando Collor de Mello, supporters of parliamentary system said that parliament needed powers to more easily change the chief of government. Brazilian populists claimed that the legislative branch was made up of the corrupt. The supreme court was accused of being the greatest supporter of political corruption.https://professorlfg.jusbrasil.com.br/artigos/342779691/stf- evoluiu-mas-ainda-e-grande-aliado-da-corrupcao-politica Brazilian monarchists claimed that the spread of corruption, was a consequence of the republican system of government. = By ideology = Right-wing politicians accuse left- wing politicians of being corrupt. This stereotype was created during the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, when the mensalão scandal was discovered. In the second term of Dilma Rousseff's Presidency in 2016, Citizens and right wing politicians began the movement to impeach Rousseff due to the economy failing.This was caused by how much money she took out of public banks for her federal campaign in order to become elected. Once Rousseff was impeached from the office, Michel Temer took over and completed the term in 2018. During his term, Temer began to slowly introduce far right ideals to the public. After his term in 2018, Jair Bolsonaro was elected President and became the first president with right ideals for the first time since 2001. Jair Bolsonaro built up his political campaign through Youtube at first, slowly influencing citizens with far right ideas overtime before running for office. Jair Bolsonaro claimed in his political campaign, that the Worker’s Party was the most corrupt political party in the world. The idea that left-wing activists protect criminals like thieves, rapists and murders,http://www.ilisp.org/opiniao/por-que-esquerda-ama-os-bandidos/ encouraged right-wing politicians to believe that the corrupt are also protected by leftists.

The first widely used naval microwave-frequency system, it was equipped with an antenna small enough to allow it to be mounted on small ships like corvettes and frigates, while its improved resolution over earlier radars allowed it to pick up a surfaced U-boat at around and its periscope alone at . The prototype, 271X, was fitted to HMS Orchis in March 1941 and declared operational in May. Small numbers became available during the year, with about thirty sets in operation by October. The design spawned two larger versions, Type 272 for destroyers and small cruisers, and Type 273 for larger cruisers and battleships. The 272 was not considered successful and not widely used. The 273 differed in having larger and more focused antennas, providing higher gain and thus longer range. This proved very successful and was widely used. Improved versions, the Q models or Mark IV, were introduced in early 1943. These had a much more powerful 70 kW magnetron for greater range and added a plan position indicator (PPI) display which eased the task of arranging interceptions. The near-simultaneous arrival of ASV Mark III radar, huff-duff, Type 271 and new breaks into the German's Naval Enigma codes swung the Battle of the Atlantic decidedly in favour of the Royal Navy. Later that year, the 273Q aboard HMS Duke of York found the German battleship Scharnhorst at night, leading to its destruction during the Battle of the North Cape. By the late-war period, improved versions of all of these designs were introduced. Originally known as the Mark V models, in March 1943 these were renamed Type 277, 276 and 293. These new models were retrofitted as ships came in for servicing and were widespread by late 1944. Type 271Q models remained in service on a number of ships in the post-war period, generally passing out of service with the ships that carried them. History =Background= The Royal Navy learned of Robert Watson-Watt's radar experiments in 1935 and began exploring the use of radar for naval uses very quickly. In contrast to the Air Ministry, which had no formal electronics establishment at the time, the Navy's Experimental Department in Portsmouth was a powerhouse in electronics design and was able to quickly develop a series of radars for naval use. In 1938, their Type 79 radar was the first naval radar to enter service. At the time, the only high-power radio frequency electronics operated in the shortwave bands, with wavelengths measured in metres. Existing valves (vacuum tubes) could operate at an absolute maximum of 600 MHz (50 cm wavelength), but operation anywhere near this range resulted in very low efficiency and output power. Most efforts worked on much longer wavelengths, several metres or more, where commercial electronics for shortwave broadcasts already existed. For a variety of reasons, antennas have to be a certain size relative to the wavelength of their signals, with the half-wave dipole being a common design. This meant that the radar antennas of this era had to be metres across to have reasonable performance. The prototype Type 79X, which was fitted experimentally to the minesweeper HMS Saltburn in October 1936, used a 4 m wavelength that required the antennas to be strung between the ship's masts. It could only be aimed by turning the entire ship. To improve power, a version with an even longer 7 m wavelength was developed for HMS Sheffield that provided between 15 and 20 kW of power. Its antenna could be rotated, but was enormous and heavy. =Magnetron= alt=Image of an early cavity magnetron In February 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot built a working cavity magnetron, which soon produced 1 kW of power at a wavelength of only 10 cm from a device about the size of a shoe box. A half-wave dipole for this wavelength was only long, and could easily be fitted to almost any ship or aircraft. It represented an enormous leap in performance, and microwave radar development by all of the forces began immediately. While the magnetron solved the problem of generating short-wavelength signals with high power, that alone does not make a complete radar system. One also needs a radio signal detector that can operate at equally high frequencies, cables capable of carrying that signal to the antenna efficiently, and a host of other developments. The Navy was in a particularly good position to take advantage of the magnetron, as part of their Experimental Department was the Valve Laboratory. In 1939, the Valve Laboratory was put in charge of the Committee for the Coordination of Valve Development (CDV), leading development of new valve technology for all of the UK's armed forces. The Valve Laboratory led development of the tunable reflex klystron that provided the needed intermediate frequency signal for a superheterodyne receiver that operated at microwave frequencies, while the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE), the Air Ministry's research arm, introduced a silicon-tungsten crystal detector that generated the appropriate high-frequency signals for the reflex klystron. By July 1940, samples of all of these devices had arrived at the TRE's experimental shops, along with more powerful magnetrons working between 5 and 10 kW. Herbert Skinner cobbled together the various parts on a table to produce the first working microwave radar. This used the updated NT98 magnetron that produced 5 kW of power. They demonstrated it by having someone ride a bicycle in front of the device while holding a metal plate acting as a reflector. This test demonstrated the new radar's ability to pick up targets even when they were very close to the horizon, something previous designs could not do. Development of production radars using this basic design was undertaken immediately by the Air Ministry and Admiralty. From 1940 the possibility of air attack on the Experimental Department was considered serious, but it was not until late that year that a move was initiated. In March 1941, the Experimental Department became the Admiralty Signal Establishment (ASE), a name it retained for the rest of the war period. In August, the ASE moved to Lythe Hill House in Haslemere, closer to London. =Development= While the Navy's radar development was making great strides, their performance in the Battle of the Atlantic was dismal. Though the summer and autumn of 1940, losses in the North Atlantic rose to unsustainable levels. A report on the state of the ongoing U-boat war in September noted that 70% of all successful attacks by U-boats were made at night and on the surface. This was possible because Asdic could not detect a surfaced submarine, and the radars available at that time were too large to be fitted to the most common escorts. During this wide-ranging \\"Trade Protection Meeting\\", the call for \\"An efficient radar set for anti-submarine surface and air escorts must be developed\\" was approved by the Prime Minister and given the highest national priority. In October 1940 a team from the ASE under the direction of Stenhard Landale was sent to the TRE's labs in Swanage to study their lash-up devices. By this time the TRE had two systems in operation and the second could be mounted on a trailer. When tested on the sea-side cliff near the labs, this radar successfully detected small ships in Swanage Bay. The Navy team developed their own version of the prototype, known only as \\"Apparatus C\\", which was tested for the first time on the trailer on 8 December 1940. The antenna, consisting of two parabolic reflectors, worked well on the top of a cliff, but would not work well nearer to the surface as it would be in the case of a mounting on a ship. In this case the low angle between the antenna and waves on the sea would cause spurious returns, or \\"clutter\\", that could hide a target. Herbert Skinner, who was leading antenna development at the TRE, took it upon himself to test the existing designs at various altitudes. During a series of tests between 15 and 17 December, Skinner used the TRE's \\"Apparatus B\\" against the small ship Titlark and demonstrated tracking at at the top of the cliff, at the Peveril Point, and at . Another problem would be keeping the signal from the tightly focused pencil beams on the target as the ship rolled and pitched in the sea. Bernard Lovell suggested the solution would be to use an antenna that had a narrow horizontal beam like the parabolas they were using, but little vertical focussing. This would create a fan-shaped beam spread over about 80 degrees vertically that would continue to paint the target as the ship moved. The resulting design became known as a \\"cheese antenna\\" due to it looking like a section cut from a cheese wheel. A prototype was mounted to the admiralty trailer on 19 December and towed to the beach for testing. =271X= Some sense of the urgency of the development program can be seen in the fact that an order for 12 sets had already been placed with the Admiralty's communications laboratory at Eastney (outside Portsmouth). Initially known simply as the Type 271, these models were later referred to as 271X to indicate their prototype status. The coaxial cables used to carry the signal from the radar to the receiver lost about 22 dB per of length at microwave frequencies. Even at short distances this would result in unacceptable losses. The solution was to place the transmitter and the initial stages of the receiver on the back of the antennas in a metal box, reducing the wiring length to about . However, the local oscillator, a reflex klystron, had to be mounted at the operator's station for manual tuning. This limited the maximum distance between the main receiver and the antennas to about . This problem was solved by having the operator's cabin directly below the antenna. The only other significant change between the Apparatus C and 271X was a minor change to the antenna, clipping off the outside edges to reduce its width, and slightly increasing the distance between the upper and lower plates from to offset the slight loss of performance from the clipping. This new antenna design was known as Outfit ANA. The antenna was placed on a rotating platform that was manually turned around the vertical axis using a drive shaft that passed through the roof of the radar operator's cabin and ended in a steering wheel taken from an automobile. Because the coaxial cables carrying the signal to the cabin had only so much play, the antennas were limited to about 200 degrees of rotation, unable to point to the rear. To protect the system from the elements, a cylindrical radome was constructed using perspex, which was at that time the only known microwave-transparent material with sufficient mechanical strength. The system used a number of flat panels held together in teak framing. The resulting arrangement had a very strong resemblance to a lantern, which quickly became its nickname. =Initial trials= alt=Image of Her Majesties Ship Orchis with the first Type 271 radar At a meeting on 11 February 1941, the prototype order at Eastney was increased with another 12 units, and an order for 100 production sets was placed with Allen West and Company. At the same meeting, the newly completed Flower-class corvette HMS Orchis was set aside for sea trials. The first batch of prototypes had been completed by the end of February 1941, which led to a follow-on order for another 150 sets. The system was rapidly fitted to Orchis and began trials in the Firth of Clyde on 25 March 1941. Mounted at the mast height, the system could track a small submarine at and saw some returns as far as . In higher sea-states, the maximum range was reduced to . While this was shorter than the ranges achieved with the experimental systems at Swanage, they were considered operationally useful, and were in any event much longer than visual range at night. Allen West was told to go ahead with the current design for production models. After the successful tests on Orchis, Eastney continued to produce the original order and increasingly liaised with Allen West on the production models. By September 1941, 32 corvettes had been equipped and a small number of other ships, including the battleship HMS King George V, cruiser HMS Kenya and naval trawler Avalon. The system was not suitable for fitting to most destroyers or cruisers because it required the receiver room to be directly below the antenna, and most ships of that size had large masts taking up the suitable roof area. =271, 272= During 1941, great strides were being made in microwave electronics and new solutions to problems were constantly being introduced. A number of such changes were worked into the production models as the prototype series came to an end. One such improvement was the CV35 reflex klystron which replaced the earlier NR89 of the 271X. The CV35 had an efficiency of 3 to 4%, compared to the original 1%, and therefore produced about three times the output signal for any given input. This allowed the distance between the antenna and receiver to be extended up to as much as , offering much more flexibility in mounting options. The CV35 was also electrically more stable and made tuning the system far easier. Sets using the CV35 were initially known as 271X Mark II, but in March 1942 they were re-designated 271 Mark II, dropping the X. The original antenna arrangement was retained for the production 271s, but the mounting was changed to produce the Outfit ANB. Further experiments were carried out that replaced the direct drive shaft that the operator used to turn the antennas with a Bowden cable to allow the cabin to be remote from the antenna. At the same time, those electronics that remained mounted on the antenna were repackaged to be as small as possible, reducing weight. With these changes, it was now possible to mount the antenna remotely, making it suitable for use on destroyers. In typical use, the antenna was mounted at the level on the mast. In August 1941, units with this sort of drive were renamed Type 272. The Type 272 was also mounted to cruisers, but in this role a new problem was discovered; the blast from the main guns was strong enough that it tended to crack the perspex in the radome. This was not wholly solved until 1943, when an entirely new radome was introduced. =273= Type 284.alt=Image of Her Majesties Ship Nigeria showing the type 273 radar The move to the cheese antenna resulted in a loss of performance, but one that was unavoidable due to the pitch and roll of the ships. Such was not the case on larger ships, where the slower movements in waves made it possible to offset the effects using a mechanical stabilizer. This led to experiments using the original diameter parabolic mirrors used in the TRE sets for use on larger ships. These provided a gain of 250, far greater than the cheese antennas. Combined with the mounting higher on the mast, it was expected this system would offer significantly greater detection range. Six prototype systems were delivered in August 1941, given the name Type 273. The first production fitting was to HMS Nigeria at the end of the year. In October 1941, Mediterranean Command asked for some solution to the problem of detecting Italian human torpedoes which were attacking ships in Gibraltar and Alexandria. A modified version of the Type 273 was provided, removing the stabilization system (not needed on land) and further increasing the reflectors to which improved gain to 575. Several such systems were built under the name Types 273S (for Shore) and delivered in 1942. A further one-off modification was made for the site at Saebol, Iceland, due to the high winds at that location. This Type 273M was mounted on a gun mount for extra stability. In testing on 29 September 1942, the 273M demonstrated a range against a trawler from its high location, which is only slightly short of the radar horizon of . =P models= By the autumn of 1941 it was clear the demand for the new radars was far beyond their projected production rates. In addition to the demand for naval ships, the British Army was adopting them for coastal defense purposes and the Air Ministry was interested in using them for short-range air traffic control and early warning. The initial order of 150 units with Allen West was increased to 350. In order to speed production, Metropolitan-Vickers was contracted to redesign the electronics units to make them easier to manufacture. The original system consisted of three large cabinets in two vertical stacks. The new designs, which was given the model number \\"P\\", used only two cabinets mounted in a single vertical stack. To speed the fitting of the P models to ships, entirely new radar cabins were prefabricated for each ship that was expected to return from sea for its periodic boiler cleaning. The installation occurred in two stages: during one cleaning a new area on the ship was prepared for the radar, and on its next visit a completed unit was hoisted aboard by crane. =PPI display= In 1941 the Air Ministry began work on the plan-position indicator, or PPI, a new type of radar display that produced a 2D image of the space around the radar station. The PPI is what one normally thinks of as a radar display, with a circular face and a visible beam rotating around it. This display was being used to help ease the task of plotting an airborne interception, as both the target aircraft and the interceptor appeared on the same display, allowing the operators to easily direct the interceptor. Late in 1941, the labs at Eastney began adapting the PPI for use with the Type 271. The display made scanning the surface dramatically easier as the operator could swing the antenna back and forth and the display would show the entire sweep as a single display. Previously they would have to carefully watch for \\"blips\\" in the display as they swung the antenna, and then rotate it back and forth in ever-smaller motions in order to determine the exact angle. Now they could make a single swing to develop an image of the entire area and measure the angle to targets off the face of the display. In February 1942 an experimental PPI using a cathode ray tube (CRT) display was fitted aboard the King George V. For this experiment, a motor was added to the flexible shaft that turned the antenna, which automatically rotated the antenna back and forth between its limits. The other end of the cable, formerly used by the operator to manually swing the antenna, was instead connected to a synchro that indicated the direction the antenna was currently facing. This was mixed with the signal from a Remote Indicating Compass. The resulting phase of the mixed output signal encoded the angle between the antenna and north, and was used to drive another synchro on the CRT's deflection plates. The result was a stabilized north-up display. In tests, the system immediately proved itself invaluable, and a contract was placed with EMI for what became known as \\"Outfit JE\\". The only difference between the prototype and the production models was the used of a smaller CRT which reduced the bulk of the resulting equipment cabin. =New radome= alt=Image of Her Majesties Ship Hesperus showing the new frameless radome As the installation of 271 become more widespread in late 1941, operators began to note an odd problem where the reflection from larger ships in a convoy would cause large areas of the display to become unusable, much larger than the ship. These were known as \\"side echoes,\\" no hint of which had been seen during initial operations. Testing began in February 1942 using HMS Guillemot, a Kingfisher-class sloop, and later moved to the production model on the 271P on HMS Veteran in March. These quickly revealed the problem was due to the pillars that supported the roof of the lantern-style enclosure. A new design entirely of perspex was developed, consisting of several thick cylinders that were stacked vertically to produce a complete radome. The first example was fitted to HMS Hesperus in November 1942, and the entire fleet had been modified by the end of 1943. The radome for the Type 273s took longer to design, as it was much heavier and also had to withstand the blast of the firing guns, but these were converted by the end of 1943. =Q models= Development of microwave techniques continued at a furious pace through 1941 and by the end of the year several significant improvements had progressed to production quality. Among these was the soft Sutton tube, which allowed a microwave signal to be switched between two wires, thereby allowing a single antenna to be used both for transmission and reception. Another improvement was the initial delivery of mass-produced semiconductor crystals from the United States, which were smaller and more robust than the UK models. The most surprising of all was the new \\"strapped\\" magnetron design, a seemingly minor modification that produced an enormous boost in performance, allowing a unit the same size of the original NT98 to reach efficiencies on the other of 40%, or even 50 to 60% when used with a new and more powerful magnet. This led to a corresponding boost in output, with no change to the input, allowing it to produce as much as 500 kW. The Navy had already tried to increase performance of the existing sets by boosting the power of the NT98 magnetrons. They found that the NT98 could produce as much as 100 kW of output using an input pulse of 1 MW. However, this was at the very limit of the power-handling NT100 tetrodes. An intermediate goal was to produce a 25 kW design, which was tested on the trailer at Eastney in September 1941. This was based on a new modulator that was triggered by a thyratron to produce the required power pulses. It was around the same time this new unit was being tested that the first strapped magnetron arrived in Eastney, the CV56. This was fitted to the experimental trailer and aimed at Nab Tower, their standard target. To everyone's surprise, the only result was to melt the dipole in the transmitting antenna. This led to the adoption of a waveguide and feedhorn, which were being developed at the same time. Only a few weeks later an even more powerful magnetron arrived, the CV76, which produced 500 kW. In order to deploy the new magnetrons as quickly as possible, it was decided to retain the existing antenna installations and use the CV56 at 70 to 100 kW, ultimately settling at 70. Only the transmitter would be modified with a waveguide, the receiver would continue to use the coaxial feed. Three hand-built prototypes of the new equipment chassis were built at Eastney, along with an order for ten production prototypes each from Marconi and Allen West. A new problem emerged; even though the system used separate transmitter and receiver antennas, the transmissions were so powerful that enough leaked signal reached the receiver's antenna to burn out the crystals. This required the addition of the soft Sutton tube to the receiver to further isolate it from the transmitter's signals. The first tests were carried out on HMS Marigold in May 1942 off Tobermory, which also tested its ability to see the splashes from the 4-inch naval gun shells. A second unit was fitted to the 273 antenna on King George and tested off Scapa Flow in July. The second escort to receive 271Q was HMS Itchen, which was also the first to receive the new radome. This was especially important with the Q models as the increased power of the transmissions made the sidelobe reflections overwhelming. These test fits demonstrated another problem; targets at close range returned so much signal that it overwhelmed more distant targets, which made it difficult to track the U-boats while near a convoy. This problem was ultimately solved by the introduction of a swept-gain system that muted down the signals from close-in objects. These arrived in late 1943. =Q models in action= alt=Image of Her Magisties Ship Duke of York showing the 273Q radar According to the radar equation, the detection performance of a radar varies with the fourth root of transmitted power, so even with the new system delivering about 45 times the output, effective range increased by about 2.6 times. This still represented a significant improvement, as it allowed U-boats to be detected to the radar horizon from the escorts, beyond which detection would be impossible anyway. A more important difference was that the signals that were returned from shorter ranges were stronger, making them much more stable on the displays. The system's most famous action was during the Battle of the North Cape on 26 December 1943, when the 273Q on HMS Duke of York detected the German battleship Scharnhorst at a range of , and tracked her continually beginning at . This early detection, combined with accurate blind-fire ranging from the Type 284 radar, led to the Duke of York landing her very first salvo on Scharnhorst and putting her forward batteries out of action. Scharnhorst was unaware of York because her own Seetakt radar had been damaged. Following hits slowed her until the British and Norwegian destroyers were able to close and finish her off with torpedoes. Duke of York's 273 was briefly knocked out when two shells from Scharnhorst flew through the mast area. This made the stabilized platform guiding the 273's antenna lose its orientation and the antennas ended up pointing into the air. Lieutenant Bates, commander in the radar cabin, climbed the mast and managed to reorient the antenna successfully. From that moment on he was known as \\"Barehand Bates\\". The Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet praised the performance of the system: The performance against submarines was not quite so apparent, as their low profiles allowed them to disappear behind large waves. However, post-war analysis demonstrated that the 271Q offered a significant improvement in terms of sightings. From 1943, when the radar first became common, the first sighting range increased from an average of , an increase of as much as 50%. =277 series= Further development of the 271 series using the CV76 magnetron and numerous other improvements was originally carried out under the Mark V name. The main improvement was the 500 kW magnetrons and the single transmit/receive antenna. Over time these changes were considered so significant that they were given their own names, becoming the Type 277 radar and the associated 276 and 293. These versions began to replace the 271s starting in mid-1944, and had completely replaced them for new installations by 1945. Ships continued to receive the 271Q through the transition period, including, for example, HMCS Haida, which received her 271Q in 1944. These late-war installations tended to be replaced for those ships that survived into the post-war era; Haida received a Type 293 in 1946. Other uses The Type 271 was so ahead of its time that it found a number of uses in unrelated roles where it served out the war in front-line service. =Coast Defense= A significant role for the 271 was the British Army's adaptation to the Coast Defense role. These radars were placed along the eastern coast of the British Isles to look for enemy ships in the English Channel. Earlier units based on 1.5 m wavelength VHF systems had troubles finding E-boats, a problem the 271's shorter wavelength and much higher resolution eliminated. Very early in development, one of the 271X units was sent to the Army's radar research site, ADRDE in Christchurch, Dorset. As was the case for the 273, the fan-shaped beam of the cheese antenna was not needed and it was replaced by a parabolic reflector. These were even larger than the original three foot designs of the test models, increasing to diameter. These improved gain about 25 times compared to the 271 and about five times that of the 273. The entire system, including the operator's cabin, was mounted on an anti-aircraft gun carriage. The antennas were mounted directly to the side of the cabin, rotating with it. This had the significant advantage that the coaxial cables between the antennas and the equipment inside were very short. The first example was sited at the Lydden Spout Battery in July 1941. Unofficially referred to as Type NT271X, it was later given the official name Radar, Coast Defense, Number 1 Mark 4, or CD No.1 Mk.4 for short. By the end of August, the testing team reported: The tests were so successful that the prototype was left in-place as an operational unit, and immediate order for another twelve hand-built units was placed with ADRDE. A further order for fifty production models mounted on a mobile trailer was placed, and formed the \\"K\\" stations of the coast defense network. As the 271 continued to be modified with new equipment and techniques, the Army followed suit. The use of the soft Sutton tube allowed the second antenna to be removed, and the addition of waveguides improved the packaging possibilities. A new version, Radar, Coast Defense, Number 1 Mark 5, mounted the now single antenna on a separate and much smaller trailer with the rest of the electronics in a non-rotating semi-trailer. Some were mounted on permanent mounts, in which case they were known as Radar, Coast Defense, Number 1 Mark 6. =Chain Home Extra Low= As the Army began deploying the CD Mk.4 radars, the Royal Air Force (RAF) began noticing new attacks by German aircraft that were not being detected by their Chain Home Low systems. These raids, later nicknamed \\"tip-n-run\\" after a backyard cricket rule, used high- speed fighter bombers like the Focke-Wulf FW 190. The aircraft flew at extremely low altitudes, perhaps over the water, bombed a sea-side target, and then quickly turned for home. The aircraft were visible to radar only for the few moments when they climbed above their targets and then turned away. To address these attacks, in December 1942 the RAF took over eleven of the CD units and renamed them the AMES Type 52, but much better known as Chain Home Extra Low. A further three were added to the network in May 1943. These followed the same development as the Army models, and over time were known as the Type 52 through Type 56. In total, 38 stations were eventually added to the network. Description =Antenna layout= HMS Swiftsure.alt=Image of a double cheese antenna on His Majesty's Ship Swiftsure The 271 required a thin beam side-to-side in order to provide accuracy while having a wide beam up-and-down so that the signal hit the water's surface as the ship pitched and rolled. This led to the use of a \\"cheese\\" antenna design, which consists of a slice cut out of a parabolic reflector with plates on the top and bottom. The resulting design \\"squeezes\\" the signal between the two plates, and it rapidly spreads out as it exits the area between them. Additionally, production models of the antenna clipped the outer edges of the parabolic section to make the antenna narrower. The clipped portions were fitted with small end-plates, which gave rise to the side-reflections. The 271 was designed just before the development of a system for switching an antenna between a transmitter and receiver working at microwave frequencies, so two separate antennas were used, placed one on top of the other. The flat upper and lower surfaces of the cheese made this simple, and the metal plates protected the receiver from stray signals from the transmitter. The antenna was mounted on a post running through a metal tube. The top of the tube held a bearing system that the antenna sat on. The post ran through the roof of the radar operator's cabin and ended in a large wheel that was used to manually turn the antenna. The standard Outfit ANB had a gain of approximately 55. The 273's larger reflector improved this to about 250 while the 273S land-based model's reflector further improved this to 575. =Electronics= The 271's electronics were state-of- the-art for the 1940s, and give some indication of the difficulty in producing such systems at the time. The receiver in the original 271X had 20 dB of noise, but this improved slightly in production to 16 - 18 dB. The introduction of US-made detector crystals offered a further improvement to 14 - 16 dB. In early fits, the equipment was packed into two large cabinets, about as tall as a common refrigerator but somewhat narrower. For production units, this had been reduced to a single cabinet with two large boxes on the bottom and middle, and a much smaller unit on top. The lowest unit was the power supply and pulse-forming system, with the receiver and display on the middle, and tuner on top. The P-models added the PPI display, which was otherwise similar to the later production models of the earlier marks. The Q-models deliberately used the same layout as the P in order to ease conversion. =Displays and interpretation= Early models, A through M, used an A-scan display. This used a single cathode ray tube (CRT) with the beam being pulled across the display left-to-right by a time base generator triggered by the transmission pulses. Targets along the current line of sight, or \\"line of shoot\\" as it is known in radar terms, caused the beam to deflect slightly, forming a \\"blip\\" on the display. Since the motion of the beam was timed to be the same as the time of the radar signal, the position across the face of the CRT was a direct analog of the range to the target. The system had two range settings, and . The CRT could also be used to measure the pulse shapes and perform other maintenance duties. The P and Q models changed the display to be, primarily, a plan-position indicator using a larger CRT. On this display the antenna's angle relative to magnetic north is used to rotate the beam around the display face, with \\"north up\\". A time base is used to pull the beam from the center to the outer rim along this angle. Instead of deflecting the beam to produce a blip, the amplified signal instead causes the signal to grow brighter. When the antenna sweeps by a target, a small blip lights up on the otherwise dark display face. Getting this to work requires careful adjustment by the operator to mute down the internal noise of the amplifier without also muting out small signals.

Story Eons ago, a cube–like peaceful planet named Quarton is populated by shape–shifting living bricks called Tenkai. Quartron was ravaged by a war between two opposite factions: the Corekai Soldiers, led by the valiant and fearless Commander Beagle (\\"Beag\\"); and the Corrupted Army, led by the ruthless Lord Vilius, who desired to obtain the source of Tenkai energy for his own purposes. However, the only ones who were strong enough to defeat him were the 4 Legendary Tenkai Knights of Quarton: Bravenwolf, Tributon, Valorn, and Lydendor. Facing defeat, Vilius unleashed the mighty Tenkai Dragon, who was later defeated by the 4 Knights where its fragments scattered across the planet. These heroes were never seen again. One year later, Lord Vilius and the infamous Corrupted Army have returned, more powerful than ever before. Now on planet Earth in the year 2034 within Benham City, four young teenage boys Guren, Ceylan, Toxsa, and Chooki find an interdimensional portal to Quarton where they are chosen by Boreas of the Guardians to become the new generation of Tenkai Knights and prevent Lord Vilius and his Corrupted Army empire from taking control of both worlds.

Most of the franchise features an apocalyptic mecha action story, which revolves around the efforts by the paramilitary organization NERV to fight hostile beings called Angels, using giant humanoids called Evangelions (or EVA's for short) that are piloted by select teenagers. Subsequent works deviate from this theme to varying degrees, focusing more on romantic interactions between the characters, plotlines not present in the original works, and reimaginings of the conflicts from the original works. The Neon Genesis Evangelion manga debuted in Shōnen Ace in December 1994, to generate interest in the upcoming anime release. The Neon Genesis Evangelion anime was written and directed by Hideaki Anno, originally airing from October 1995 until March 1996. The general consensus is that the anime was groundbreaking; it explored religious, psychological, and philosophical themes, while initially appearing to be a standard mecha show. There was some debate over the controversial ending of the television series. In response, two films were made to provide an alternate ending for the show: Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth, released in March 1997, and The End of Evangelion released in July 1997. Death is a compilation of clips from the TV series, with some new footage added, and Rebirth comprises the first 30 minutes or so of End of Evangelion. The popularity of the show spawned numerous additional media, including video games, radio dramas, audio books, a novel, pachinko machines, and a tetralogy of films titled Rebuild of Evangelion. Other derivative works include Angelic Days, Petit Eva: Evangelion@School and Campus Apocalypse. Neon Genesis Evangelion has become one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.  Setting  Works within the Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise typically have the same setting, characters and theme, but can vary in their portrayal of the storyline with alternate re-tellings of the original anime. Evangelions fictional setting takes place after the Second Impact, a cataclysmic explosion in Antarctica in the year 2000, which resulted in the deaths of billions and threw the Earth off its axis. Fifteen years after the Second Impact, a group of mysterious beings referred to as \\"Angels\\" begin appearing and pose a worldwide and existential threat to mankind. The NERV organization, a paramilitary special agency, is tasked with defeating the Angels, with the use of giant mechanical warriors known as \\"Evangelions\\" to fight them. A select group of children pilot the Evangelions, with a focus on Shinji Ikari, Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley Soryu. The backdrop of Neon Genesis Evangelion slowly reveals the true nature of Rei Ayanami, the Evangelions, the Angels, the NERV organization and a group known as the SEELE organization. Religious themes, include Christianity and Kabbalah references to Adam, Lilith and the Dead Sea Scrolls. The series is well known for its psychoanalysis of the characters, most heavily covered in the implementation of the Human Instrumentality Project, the secret goal of NERV and SEELE, whose result varies across different media, including the original anime, films, manga and video games.  TV series, original net animation and films  =Neon Genesis Evangelion= , commonly referred to as Evangelion or Eva, is a Japanese science-fantasy animation series that first aired from October 1995 to March 1996. It was directed and written by Hideaki Anno. Evangelion follows Shinji Ikari, a fourteen-year-old boy, who is summoned to Tokyo-3 by his father Gendo Ikari to pilot Evangelion Unit-01 on the eve of an Angel attack. Treated as a tool by his father, Shinji joins Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley Soryu as mankind's last hope against the mysterious beings known as the \\"Angels\\". As the series progresses, the true natures of NERV, the Evangelions, and the Angels are revealed. =Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death and Rebirth= Death and Rebirth, originally released on March 15, 1997, is a film that consists of a highly condensed character-based recap and re-edit of the episodes 1–24, titled Death, and the first half of an unfinished new ending, titled Rebirth, a retelling of episodes 25 and 26 of the television series as the events of the Human Instrumentality Project unfold from an external point of view. = The End of Evangelion = The End of Evangelion, released on July 19, 1997, is the completed version of Rebirth, an alternate version of the final episodes of the television series.

The first film Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone was released in Japan on September 1, 2007, with Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance and Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo released on June 27, 2009 and November 17, 2012 respectively. The final film Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time is slated for a January 23, 2021 release date. =Proposed live-action film= Development of a live-action movie version of Neon Genesis Evangelion by Gainax, Weta Workshop Ltd., and ADV Films (then the worldwide distributor of the Evangelion series outside of Asia and Australia) was announced at the Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2003. Early coverage included ADV Films raising \\"about half of the $100 million to $120 million needed to produce the film\\" and some concept art produced by Weta Workshop. As time passed without any official announcements of production, the film project showed increasing signs of being in development hell. At Anime Expo 2008, ADV founders Matt Greenfield and John Ledford revealed that they had hired the producer John Woo, pitched the idea to other producers such as Jerry Bruckheimer and Steven Spielberg,Movies - The Vile One's Dungeon 8.07.08: San Diego Comic Con 2008 - Jane And The Dragon Interview with Richard Taylor and Martin Baynton. 411mania.com (2011-05-02).

At Ohayocon 2009, Matt Greenfield announced that several U.S. studios were competing for final rights to the project, predicting an official announcement naming the studio, director, and perhaps casting information within the next nine months (he later noted that the closer he got to sealing a deal, the less he could say anything about it).Evangelion Live Action Movie. Movie Chronicles. Retrieved on 2011-12-18. Though the sudden collapse and asset sale of A.D. Vision in September 2009 raised concerns over the project's viability, Greenfield, Ledford, and producer Joseph Chou insisted the project was still actively searching for a director (claiming delays owed more to the general deterioration of the American anime market than to ADV's internal issues). In August 2011, A.D. Vision sued Gainax, claiming their refusal to accept an option payment for the perpetual live-action rights to Evangelion was a breach of contract and resulted in losing an opportunity to produce the film with a major studio. A.D. Vision has asked to be awarded the full live-action rights and any accruing legal fees. Manga and light novel A number of manga series based on the anime have been released, most notably the official series by series character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, which was first serialized in February 1995 (eight months before the series' official premiere, in order to promote interest), and ended in November 2014, 19 years later. Three other manga have been created: Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days by Fumino Hayashi, Shinji Ikari Raising Project by Takahashi Osamu, and Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse by Min Min. A light novel series Neon Genesis Evangelion: ANIMA was serialized from 2008-2013 in Dengeki Hobby Magazine. The series set in an alternate future diverging from the events of the anime. The novel begins 3 years after the end of the Human Instrumentality Project, replacing episodes 25 and 26 of the anime, as well as the End of Evangelion film. Our team of former Eva pilots are coming to terms with the aftermath of the battle at NERV HQ, while adapting to normal life. Three clones of Ayanami Rei have been put into Eva units and sent into space as a precautionary way to seek out and eradicate the remaining mass-produced Evangelion units, as well as monitor Earth’s safety. Soundtracks and music Evangelion has had numerous soundtrack releases since its debut on television, with most of the music composed by Shirō Sagisu. The television series' opening theme song \\"A Cruel Angel's Thesis\\" has become an iconic anime theme song. Four releases titled \\"Evangelion Classic\\", each one contained the classical music of Beethoven, Verdi, Handel, and J.S. Bach respectively. Other media The Evangelion franchise has spread from the original anime into a number of different media, with some following the official canon (of the 26-episode anime series and its three related films or the new Rebuild series) and others differing on important plot points originally introduced in the anime. =Books= * Newtype 100% Collection: A 1997 collection of Newtypes coverage of Evangelion, particularly of artwork * Death & Rebirth and End of Evangelion theatrical pamphlets : Limited edition supplementary booklets were distributed in Japanese theaters during the initial run of both Evangelion: Death and Rebirth and The End of Evangelion.

These range from action games such as the same titled game for the Nintendo 64 and its sequel on the PlayStation 2, the fighting game Battle Orchestra, the visual novels Girlfriend of Steel and Girlfriend of Steel 2nd, and the rhythm game 3nd Impact (read \\"Sound Impact\\"). Characters from Evangelion also make numerous appearances in other titles such as in the Super Robot Wars series by Banpresto.

A member since Fleetwood Mac's inception in July 1967, he remained with the band until his abrupt departure in February 1971, when he joined a religious cult called the \\"Children of God\\", now known as \\"The Family International\\", with which he is still affiliated. After a pair of solo albums in the 1970s, he continued to tour as a musician, but did not release another album until 2006. Releasing further solo albums in 2012, 2014 and 2016, Spencer has also recorded as part of the folk trio Steetley. Personal life Spencer was born in Hartlepool, County Durham, and began taking piano lessons at the age of nine. Switching to guitar in his teens, his speciality became the slide guitar, and he was strongly influenced by the American blues musician Elmore James. Fleetwood Mac In the summer of 1967, Spencer came to the attention of ex-Bluesbreakers guitarist Peter Green, who was looking for another musician to join him in his new Fleetwood Mac project. Green had recruited drummer Mick Fleetwood and temporary bassist Bob Brunning, and wanted a second guitar player to fill out the sound onstage. Spencer was then playing with blues trio the Levi Set, and was already an accomplished slide guitarist and pianist. He fitted in well, and soon after his arrival, the band's intended bassist John McVie joined. This line-up of Fleetwood Mac recorded two albums of traditional blues songs, with Spencer contributing many variations on the Elmore James theme, particularly centred around James' version of \\"Dust My Broom\\", plus a few songs of his own. Green became frustrated because Spencer did not seem willing to contribute to Green's songs, whereas Green always played on Spencer's recordings where necessary.The Penguin Q&A; with Jeremy Spencer, June 1999 On Fleetwood Mac, the 1968 debut album, Spencer gives a solo performance on vocal and piano of Robert Johnson's Hellhound on My Trail. Since Spencer's musical contributions to the band were too narrowly focused, Green and Fleetwood brought in a third guitarist, 18-year-old Danny Kirwan, after 1968's Mr. Wonderful. This album featured several of Spencer's Elmore James tunes. Green and Kirwan found that they worked well together musically, quickly developing the style that provided hits such as \\"Albatross\\", \\"Man of the World\\" and \\"Oh Well\\", none of which featured Spencer. Spencer found himself slightly isolated within the band, and chose to contribute very little to the band's third album Then Play On. It was intended to complement this album with a separate EP of Spencer's work, but this never materialised. In the end, his input amounted to some piano on Green's neo-classical epic \\"Oh Well Pt. 2\\". On stage however, Spencer was an integral part of the band, with a raucous routine of old blues songs which were extremely popular with audiences. Spencer was a gifted mimic, providing excellent impersonations of Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Elmore James, John Mayall and whoever else he felt like sending up at the time. He was also often given to occasional suggestive behaviour onstage, particularly at early concerts, which sometimes landed the band in trouble with promoters and venue owners, and got them banned from London's Marquee Club.Fleetwood Mac – \\"The Vaudeville Years\\" (booklet notes), 1998 This wild onstage atmosphere was caught in Spencer's recording \\"Somebody's Gonna Get Their Head Kicked In Tonite\\", which was chosen as the B-side to the gentle \\"Man of the World\\" single in 1969. Jeremy Spencer, 18 March 1970 Away from the stage, Spencer was often quiet and withdrawn, and other band members recall him often reading the Bible in his hotel room, strongly at odds with his on-stage persona.\\"Insight\\" – BBC Radio Interview with Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Christine McVie, November 1976. Spencer became the first member of Fleetwood Mac to release a solo album, simply titled Jeremy Spencer, in 1970. This album featured many 1950s parodies and amusing songs but was not a success. In December 2015, the album was released on CD. When Green left Fleetwood Mac in mid-1970, the band were in a state of flux and there was a possibility of not continuing. However, the band held together, and both Spencer and Kirwan worked on new songs, which appeared on the Kiln House album released in the late summer of 1970. For the first time, the defining Elmore James songs were absent on Kiln House; instead, this album featured more of Spencer's 1950s parodies, including the Buddy Holly tribute \\"Buddy's Song\\". Another song, \\"One Together\\", touched on the many different personas that Spencer used onstage. During a tour of the United States in February 1971 with new keyboardist Christine McVie now having joined the band, Spencer grew disillusioned with his life in Fleetwood Mac, and has mentioned in several interviews an incident when the band were listening to a recording of an old concert. When he heard himself singing, he said, \\"That sounds horrible. It sounds like shit.\\" According to one account by Mick Fleetwood, Spencer apparently had difficulty recovering from a mescaline trip he had experienced very early on the US tour. Shortly before a journey of the band from San Francisco to Los Angeles, LA experienced a major earthquake. Being in a fragile mental state and filled with strong negative premonitions, Spencer was very apprehensive about having to travel to LA. He unsuccessfully pleaded with Fleetwood to cancel this leg of the tour. Shortly after arriving in LA on February 15,1971, the day of a gig the group was scheduled to perform at the Whisky A Go Go, Spencer left the hotel room he shared with Fleetwood to visit a bookshop on Hollywood Boulevard. He did not return, forcing the cancellation of that evening's concert while the band and members of their entourage went searching for him. Some days later, he was found to have joined the religious group the Children of God, and he declared that he no longer wanted to be involved with Fleetwood Mac. Despite appeals from the band's manager, Clifford Davis, to fulfil his obligations to Fleetwood Mac, Spencer could not be persuaded to rejoin the band and they had to struggle on without him, first recalling Peter Green out of retirement as an emergency measure, and later recruiting new guitarist Bob Welch. Despite many rumours of brainwashing and forced induction into the organisation, Spencer has always maintained that he joined the organisation of his own free will. He had been approached by a young man named Apollos, who engaged Spencer in conversation about God, and invited him to a nearby mission where other members were staying. During the evening, Spencer became convinced that this change of direction was the best course for him to take, and by the time Fleetwood Mac found him, his mind was made up.Jeremy Spencer interviewed by Steve Clark, NME magazine, 5 October 1974. Despite his continued confidence that he made the right choice, he has said that the manner of his departure from the band was regrettable: \\"The way I left was wrong and a mistake. I should've told them right away but I was desperate.\\"Jeremy Spencer interviewed by Martin Celmins, Classic Rock magazine, March 2006. After Fleetwood Mac Spencer and his then-wife Fiona moved to the US to settle with the Children of God. He soon formed a new band within the organisation and played free concerts around the country. An album was recorded, Jeremy Spencer and the Children, although without commercial success. In contrast to his commercially successful period, relatively little is known about this period of his life, but he travelled the world recording a considerable amount of music for the purposes of the organization. He moved to Brazil in 1975 and then to Italy in 1977.Atlantic Records Publicity Biography – The Jeremy Spencer Band, 1979 In 1978 a member of the Children of God hired Martin and Steven Machat to represent Spencer and his new band. The Machats then secured them a major record deal with Atlantic Records in New York. In 1978–79 the newly formed Jeremy Spencer Band recorded the album Flee, which had a little commercial success. During the 1980s Spencer lived in the Philippines before working in India in the 1990s, holding charity concerts. He later lived in Ireland and then Germany and still works for the Children of God (now called the Family International), mainly as a book illustrator and story writer. He has continued to play music, often for his own amusement or in small settings, but also has appeared more often at various blues and gospel conventions. In 2006 he released the album Precious Little, recorded in Norway. The album showed a return to the blues and the slide guitar style that he became famous for while he was with Fleetwood Mac. Spencer was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 for his past work as a member of Fleetwood Mac. During the 2000s there were rumours of a reunion of the early line-up of Fleetwood Mac involving Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer. Whilst these two guitarists and vocalists apparently remained unconvinced of the merits of such a project, Danny Kirwan, who joined the band in 1968 as a third guitarist and vocalist and was fired in 1972, remained silent on the subject. Kirwan died in 2018. In April 2006, during a question-and-answer session on the Penguin Fleetwood Mac fan website, bassist John McVie said of the reunion idea: ::\\"If we could get Peter and Jeremy to do it, I'd probably, maybe, do it. I know Mick would do it in a flash. Unfortunately, I don't think there's much chance of Danny doing it. Bless his heart.\\" In 2007 Spencer was in contact with his former Fleetwood Mac bandmates Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, and according to McVie, the three had informal jam sessions with Rick Vito at Fleetwood's home.The Penguin Q&A; with John McVie, January 2007 Spencer also took part in the TV documentary Peter Green: Man of the World,BBC4 in which he was interviewed together with John McVie and Mick Fleetwood. In 2012 Spencer released a new album, Bend in the Road, which was recorded at Tempermill Studios in Ferndale, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The vinyl, CD and download featured different track listings This was followed in 2014 by Coventry Blue. Since then Spencer has concentrated on instrumental work. Homebrewed Blues (2016) showcased his slide guitar playing while Treading Softly (2018) and Latina Nights (2019) focused on music inspired by Ireland and Latin America respectively. Several of Spencer's children formed a band in England called JYNXT. =Steetley= During 2012–13, Spencer became involved with Hartlepool-based singer- songwriter Andy Oliver, and they eventually decided to record songs together. They formed a trio named Steetley, along with the Northern Irish musician and actress Janet Bamford, and in December 2013, released their debut album, The Moment She Fell.

Built in 1938, it closed to automobile traffic in 1965 and was renovated in 1988 to replace rotting timbers. Designed by T.K. May, it was built by the U.S. Forest Service with Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) labor. The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. History The construction of the Dinkey Creek Bridge was part of a wider effort to improve access to recreation and timber resources in the area. The bridge was designed by engineer T.K. \\"Tank\\" May. The concrete abutments were designed by the Fresno County Surveyor in June 1938, and construction on the bridge completed that year. Designed as a highway bridge to carry McKinley Grove Road, it was built by the U.S. Forest Service with Civilian Conservation Corps labor. The Colletti Construction Company of San Rafael cut the timber and test assembled it, before disassembling it and shipping it to the site to be erected by a CCC crew. The name \\"Dinkey\\" comes from a dog by that name, which is applied to the bridge, creek, lake, meadow, and nearby mountain. Two stories of the origin of the name are noted, in which the dog was either injured or killed in an altercation with a bear, after which the area was named \\"Dinkey\\". In 1956, a new steel bridge was built about downstream. In 1965, the Dinkey Creek Bridge closed to automobile traffic because of wood rot; it has served as a pedestrian bridge since then. By 1988, the rot was becoming significant, so the untreated decking, wheelguards, railings, and longitudinal stringers were replaced with preservative-treated components of the same dimensions and material. The renovation also included the construction of a concrete wall in the creek upstream of the west abutment to resist erosion. The bridge was nominated for inclusion in National Register of Historic Places under Criterion C for its engineering significance; it was listed on September 5, 1996. Design and location The bridge is within the Sierra National Forest at about above sea level. It spans Dinkey Creek in a wooded valley about east of Fresno, California. The bridge's single span is long and the roadway is wide. The bridge has a Pratt truss arrangement, with the diagonal members angling inwards. The structure's bowstring-arch design, while relatively common in roof trusses, is rare in bridges. May believed it to be the only such bridge in California at the time of its construction, and a Caltrans inventory of potentially historic bridges, completed in 1987, found no such structures. The abutments are made of unreinforced Portland cement concrete in the Cyclopean style. As wet cement was poured in the form, cobblestones were added by hand; the technique was common when cement was relatively expensive compared to labor. The bridge itself was built of Douglas fir, with the truss treated with creosote preservative and the deck left untreated. The structure was designed for assembly by unskilled workmen with hand tools to take advantage of nearby CCC labor. A model of the bridge was made by May for display at the U.S. Forestry Laboratory in Richmond, California, at the request of the West Coast Lumberman's Association, because of its unique design.

A love story, it tells of a man who rescues a woman from a gang of thieves and escapes through the jungle. Plot Achmad and his group go hunting on an island. After they are separated, Achmad wanders through the island's dense jungles until he is ultimately captured by a gang of bandits under the warlord Kumis Panjang and his right-hand man Perbada. As Perbada prepares to burn Achmad alive, it is revealed that Achmad had once saved Kumis Panjang's daughter, Bidasari, from death; as a result, he is not executed. Although Bidasari is betrothed to Perbada, she and Achmad begin falling in love. In a rage, Perbada captures Kumis Panjang and Bidasari, who are eventually rescued by Achmad. Production Poetri Rimba was produced by The Teng Chun for the Jacatra Film Company, a subsidiary of his Java Industrial Film. It was directed by former journalist Inoe Perbatasari, who had made his directorial debut earlier in 1941 with Elang Darat (Land Hawk).; Soeska handled screenwriting duties, basing his story on the popular Tarzan films. The black-and-white film starred Aisjah, Loedi, Ali Joego, Bissu, and Soetiati. Overall its formula was similar to other contemporary films: kroncong songs, action, and romance. Release Poetri Rimba was released in 1941. It was Perbatasari's last film for Jacatra, although he later directed another three works for other companies. The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

Studies made in 2013 of the phylogeny of the Issidae and other groups using molecular techniques support the treatment of the group as a separate family. Sexual dimorphism can be marked. Some members of the family are called piglet bugs due to the shape of their snout. A particularly aberrant genus described in 2011 from India, Formiscurra, has males that resemble ants.

It is the first prequel book in The Maze Runner series and the fourth installment overall. The book is set prior to the events of The Fever Code and 13 years before The Maze Runner book. Development Of the novel, Dashner stated he wanted to expand the world but not focus on the main characters of the main Maze Runner trilogy. He also stated he had originally planned to write a prequel for the series, but the plans did not become official until he had completed the third book in the trilogy. Plot In the prologue, Thomas goes through the Swipe and is put in the Box, as he is one of the candidates who is needed inside. He is told that Teresa will get the Swipe as well. Thomas is then sent into the Maze with Teresa, setting the events of The Maze Runner in motion. Set thirteen years before the prologue and the events of The Maze Runner, the main story of the novel begins in New York City, when the world is hit by catastrophic solar flares. Mark and Trina form an alliance with Alec, Lana, and others, who rescue them from a group of street urchins. The group flees to the fictional Lincoln Building to avoid an impending tsunami. They camp out in the building for weeks until a yacht arrives, and the ship's crew takes them hostage and kills one of them. Alec manages to overcome their captors, and they take the yacht as their own and pilot the boat to the Appalachian Beaches. The story resumes one year after the tsunami near Asheville, a small North Carolina village in which Mark, Trina, Alec, and Lana now live. Huge helicopter-like vehicles, called Bergs, arrive and attack the people in the villages. The crew showers their settlement with darts that kill many villagers. Alec and Mark manage to subdue and take over a Berg, but its pilot crashes the vehicle to avoid answering questions. They discover that the darts contained a deadly virus, and they start their long journey back to their village. Three days later, they reach the village to find that the virus had killed most of the infected. Lana and Trina explain that after the initial death toll, people started living a little longer before they die, and symptoms of infection also changed. Mark and Alec explain that the darts were filled with a virus, and the group suspects that the virus is mutating. Trina and Lana take Mark and Alec to a locked room in which one of their other friends, Darnell, is confined. Increasingly sick, he had started having hallucinations, apparently from the virus, and begged Trina and Lana to lock him up, which they did. Their friend started saying that \\"they\\" were in his brain and eating it away. He kept repeating that \\"they\\" were going to eat at his head until nothing was left. He suddenly starts banging his head against a wall to silence \\"them\\" and ends up killing himself. Another girl, Misty, who was his friend goes into the room and comes out reporting a headache that alarms Mark and Alec. They tell Lana and Trina to lock her up as well. Immediately after they confine, she starts acting just like her dead friend by talking about \\"them,\\" and she starts to sing an eerie song about death. Mark and Alec take Lana and Trina to find the mysterious attackers' base. The group passes through an abandoned village where they meet a five-year-old girl, Deedee, who they take with them. She tells them that just like their own settlement, her village was attacked months earlier. The people turned crazy and left her behind. She shows the group a puncture mark that alarms Alec, who tells the group that Deedee must be infected. They decide to take her with them anyway since if she had no symptoms months after she had been infected by the virus, she was obviously immune to it. Traveling to find the attackers' base, Mark and Alec leave the group for a while to investigate a loud noise. They encounter a cult of infected people that believes that since Deedee is immune to the virus, unlike them, she must be some sort of demon. Mark and Alec manage to escape from the cult but find that a forest fire has been started and that Trina, Lana, and Deedee are gone from their campsite. Believing that the three girls in their party must have escaped and gone ahead of them to the attackers' base, Mark and Alec continue on to the site. They arrive at the base and sneak into what appears to be the site of the Post- Flares Coalition (PFC). They eavesdrop on a conversation and realize that the disease is widely known as \\"the Flare\\" and caused by a virus that shuts down the thinking part of people's brains. They also learn that the girls were given back to the infected cult. They are caught eavesdropping but manage to escape and steal a Berg. Mark and Alec find weapons inside the Berg; the transvices are guns that evaporate people's molecules. They recharge one to use so that they can battle the infected. Mark realizes that the Flare has started to affect his mind. Their journey inside the Berg takes them near Asheville, where they find Lana suffering badly from torture by the infected. To end her suffering, Alec must kill her with the transvice. They find Trina and Deedee at an old house, but Mark realizes that Trina also has the Flare and has forgotten him. They are attacked by the infected but manage to escape to the Berg. As Mark starts to lose his sanity, he recognizes that Deedee is truly immune to the virus and should be sent to the safety of the PFC base in Alaska. Mark plans on delivering Deedee by using a teleporter, called a flat trans, inside a PFC base in the safe part of Asheville. As they travel, they find that Alec is also dying from the Flare. Mark and Trina manage to bring Deedee to the flat trans and send her through it to safety at the Alaska PFC base. Mark orders Alec to crash the Berg into the flat trans building to prevent the infected from escaping Asheville. Trina remembers Mark, and they kiss just as the Berg crashes, killing everyone in the base. In the book's epilogue, two years later, authorities from WICKED take a little boy, Stephen, away from his mother, because he is immune to the virus. They rename him Thomas.  Characters  * Mark: A 17-year-old young man who survived the onslaught of the Flare and finds himself living with his neighbor Trina and war veterans Alec and Lana, along with a few others in the Appalachians. After a Berg releases the Flare virus that kills everyone but the four, Mark embarks on a journey to take revenge against those who ordered the execution. * Alec: A war veteran who came to rescue Mark and Trina shortly before a giant tsunami caused by the melting polar ice caps hit New York City. He and Lana have since become the two teenagers' companions since a year before the novel begins. * Trina: Mark's neighbor and love interest who was with him when the Flare first hit the Earth and has since lived together with other survivors in a small village in the Appalachians. * Lana: A war nurse who has a close relationship with Alec. The two accompany Mark and Trina ever since the onslaught of the Flare and the immediate tsunami that devastated New York City. She is the first of the four to succumb to the Flare virus. * Deedee / Teresa: A 5-year- old girl whom Mark, Alec, Trina, and Lana, find in a deserted neighboring village. She is immune to the Flare virus, a status which is demonized by her fellow villagers. Due to this, Mark decides to send her to the Post-Flare Coalition (PFC) base in Alaska, where she would be renamed Teresa Agnes. A grown Teresa is also shown in the prologue of the novel, where she becomes a witness to Thomas being delivered to the Maze. * Anton: A worker for the PFC who tells Mark and Alec about the way the Flare virus is spread. He also tells them that he and his coworkers plan to move to the PFC base in Alaska, which gives Mark the idea to send Deedee there. * Bruce: A worker for the PFC who had a hand in releasing the Flare virus in return for food for him and his coworkers. He complains about the restrictions put into the cure for the virus by the PFC base in Alaska. * Jed: A bald and earless man who is part of the villagers of Deedee's village. He prevents Mark and Alec from being killed and recounts to them about the Flare virus which destroyed his village two months and three days before. He subsequently dies due to the virus. * Toad, Misty, and Darnell: Three survivors of the Flare who are together referred to as \\"The Three Stooges\\". They live alongside Mark, Alec, Trina, and Lana, in the makeshift village in the Appalachians. Darnell is the first casualty of the Flare virus released by a Berg to their village. Misty is found to be infected just after Mark and Alec return from hijacking the Berg. After Toad puts an end to her misery, he is infected too and Alec kills him out of mercy. * Baxter: A 13-year-old boy who was part of the original group of survivors who survived the tsunami that hit New York City, alongside Mark, Trina, Alec, and Lana. When they camped out at the Lincoln Building, Baxter was killed by a man called Boss. He only appears in flashbacks. * Boss: A scavenger who ambushed Mark, Trina, Alec, Lana, Baxter, Toad, Misty and Darnell in the Lincoln Building. After killing Baxter, he threatened them to give him supplies. Mark managed to kick him off to the waters and took control of his vehicle. His female companion then committed suicide. He only appears in flashbacks. * John Michael: The current chancellor of World in Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department (WICKED), the company that approved the population control suggested by Katie McVoy to eradicate half of the world population using the Flare virus. He is mentioned in a letter found by Mark in Randall Spilker's workpad. * Randall Spilker and Ladena Lichliter: Two members of WICKED who disapproved the method suggested by Katie McVoy to kill half of the population by the VC321xb47 virus, seeing that its mutation is unpredictable. They are only mentioned in correspondence letters found by Mark in Spilker's workpad. * Katie McVoy: A member of WICKED who suggested to chancellor Michael a form of population control by killing half of the population with the VC321xb47 virus, referred to as the Flare virus; thus, she is indirectly responsible for most of the events in the series. She is only mentioned in a letter in Randall Spilker's workpad found by Mark. * Thomas: A 5-year-old boy immune to the Flare virus who is taken by WICKED from his willing mother in the epilogue of the novel. A member of WICKED decides to name him after Thomas Edison after seeing a light bulb in his house. A grown Thomas is also mentioned in the prologue of the novel from the point of view of Teresa, just before he takes his entry to the Maze. Reception Critical reception for The Kill Order was mostly positive. Publishers Weekly and KidzWorld both gave positive reviews for the book, with Publishers Weekly noting that fans of the main Maze Runner series would enjoy it. Sequel On September 27, 2016, a sequel to The Kill Order was released, titled The Fever Code; taking place between the events of The Kill Order and The Maze Runner.

Traditional roles  Albanian women reside within a conservative and patriarchal society. In such a traditional society, the women of Albania have subordinate roles in communities that believe in \\"male predominance\\". This is despite the arrival of democracy and the adoption of a free market economy in Albania, after the period under the communist Party of Labor. Based on the 500-year-old Kanun of Leke Dukagjini, a traditional code of conduct, the main role of Albanian women is to take care of the children and to take care of the home. Due to the patriarchal nature of traditional Armenian culture and society,Itano, Nicole. Quota Law Puts More Women in Armenia's Election. WeNews. May 10, 2007. women in Armenia are often expected to be virtuous and submissive, to safeguard their virginity until marriage, and assume primarily domestic tasks. Traditional social norms in Azerbaijan and lagging economic development in the country's rural regions continue to restrict women's roles in the economy, and there are reports that women have difficulty exercising their legal rights due to gender discrimination.Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Azerbaijan (2011). United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (2011). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The history, characteristic, evolution, and genealogies of present-day women in the Czech Republic can be traced back from many centuries before the establishment of the country now known as the Czech Republic. They have originated from ancestral Slavic settlers who had an economy that was based primarily on agriculture. In some parts of Italy, women are still stereotyped as being simply housewives and mothers, also reflected in the fact of a higher-than-EU average female unemployment.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7337145.stm An early description of women from Montenegro comes from a column of The New York Times on November 5, 1880, wherein the newspaper said that \\"The Montenegrin woman takes an equal share of labor with the man at field-work, and she does all the carrying\\" in relation to travel by horse ride and other forms of transport by animals. The newspaper further described them to be engaged in knitting or spinning. (abstract) Swiss tradition also places women under the authority of their fathers and their husbands.  Promoting gender equality  Legally, women in Andorra have equal rights under the laws of the Principality of Andorra. Andorra was slow to give women legal rights: women's suffrage was achieved only in 1970. In recent years, however, women have progressed significantly. Politically, Andorran women won 15 seats during their country's parliamentary election of 2011; for this reason, Andorra became the first nation in Europe and the second country internationally to have elected a \\"majority female legislature\\". The legal position of women in Austria improved since the middle of the 1970s. Based on a December 1993 study about the status of Women in Austria, the priority of legislation in Austria is based on the equal treatment of both genders rather than having equal rights only. Thus, Austrian women benefit from their government's attempt \\"to compensate for gender-specific inequality of burdens\\". However, despite of the legislative improvement in relation to the status of women in Austrian society, the concept of traditional roles prevailed. Austrian men regard most household chores and child-rearing responsibilities as being within the realm of Austrian women. Both education and gender are the basis of income levels.Lewis, Jone Johnson. Austria: Status of Women, Encyclopedia of Women's History, December 1993. Women in Azerbaijan nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men; however, societal discrimination is a problem. In Croatia, gender equality is part of Article 3 of the Constitution of Croatia. A Gender Equality Ombudsman and the Office for Gender Equality has existed since 2003. Czech Republic After the period in the history of the Czech Republic known as the Velvet Revolution, many women have become individuals with full-time jobs and who, at the same time, are also focusing on their responsibilities as homemakers, giving themselves \\"a high sense of personal efficacy and independence\\" within Czech society. Finnish women enjoy a \\"high degree of equality\\" and \\"traditional courtesy\\" among men.Alho, Olli. A guide to Finnish customs and manners, November 2002/March 2010 In 1906, the women of Finland became the first women in Europe to be granted the right to vote.Women in Business in Finland, worldbusinessculture.com There are many women in Finland who hold prominent positions in Finnish society, in the academics, in the field of business, and in the government of Finland. An example of powerful women in Finnish politics is Tarja Halonen, who became the first female president of the country (she was Foreign Minister of Finland before becoming president). The status of Grecian women has undergone change and more advancement upon the onset of the twentieth century. In 1957, they received their right to vote, which led to their earning places and job positions in businesses and in the government of Greece; and they were able to maintain their right to inherit property, even after being married.Hitton, Shanti. Social Culture of Greece, Travel Tips, USA Today Today, the Netherlands has the happiest women in the world, according to one study. San Marino introduced women's suffrage following the 1957 constitutional crisis known as Fatti di Rovereta. Sammarinese women received the right to vote in 1960. They received the right to hold political office in 1973. However, in a 1982 referendum, the women of San Marino did not win the right to retain their Sammarinese citizenship if they married male foreigners (19,000 Sammarinese voters voted to not abolish the 1928 law that striped Sammarinese women of Sammarinese citizenship if they married foreigners); as a result of losing Sammarinese citizenship, the women also lost the right to vote, to work, to own property, to reside in, and to inherit property in the Republic of San Marino. These citizenship laws were later changed by the parliament in 2000,United States Department of State and 2004, allowing women to keep their citizenship and transmit it to their children and husband. Apart from attaining prominence as \\"queens and noble women\\" in Spain's history, Spanish women now also excelled in establishing their role as women of present-day Spain \\"without a marked feminist rebellion\\". Swiss women obtained the right to vote in national elections in 1971; while women obtained the right to vote at local canton level between 1959 (the catons of Vaud and Neuchâtel in that year) and 1991 (the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden). However, despite of gaining status of having equal rights with men, some Swiss women still have to be able to attain education beyond the post-secondary level, thus they earn less money than men, and they occupy lower-level job positions.Switzerland, everyculture.com As citizens of a post-war nation, some Kosovar (or Kosovan) women have become participants in the process of peace-building and establishing pro-gender equality in Kosovo's rehabilitation process.An Approach to the Kosovo Post-War Rehabilitation Process from a Gender Perspective, QUADERNS DE CONSTRUCCIÓ DE PAU Nº 2, escola de cultura de pau, page 5.

(1936) Generation after generation, Belgian women are able to close the so-called \\"occupational gender gap\\". In younger generations, this is due to the increasing availability of \\"part-time jobs in services\\" for women. In 1999, the average earnings of a Belgian woman was 91 percent of the salary of a Belgian man. When not doing part-time jobs, Belgian women still \\"do more of the domestic work\\", depending on the agreement between female and male partners. According to International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), women of Bosnia and Herzegovina have been affected by three types of transition after the Bosnian War (1992-1995),In post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina, women are a driving force for change, IFAD namely: the \\"transition from war to peace\\", economic transition and political transition. The resulting effects include: the lowering of their public and social standing because their focus is to \\"engage in domestic duties\\" in their homes. Some Bosnian and Herzegovinian women opted to travel outside the country to search for jobs.Bosnia and Herzegovina gender profile, IFAD, 5 March 2007. The more vulnerable women among the social classes are women from the rural area. They are \\"more marginalized\\" because of lower level of education and their inclination to tradition, where they rely on men as \\"primary owners of land and other assets\\". They also have been described as with \\"limited access to land, training, modern farming techniques, finances and equipment\\", thus earn low wages. On 24 October 1975, 90% of women in the country went on strike, refusing to go to work or take care of the home - instead spending the day on the streets and protesting. In the field of labor in Italy, female standards at work are generally of a high quality and professional, but is not as excelling as in their education. The probability of a woman getting employed is mainly related to her qualifications, and 80% of women who graduate university go to look for jobs. Women in Italy usually get the same wages as men of their same position. Women holding white collar, high level or office jobs tend to get paid the same as men, but women with blue collar or manual positions are paid 1/3 less than their male counterparts. Women in the Netherlands still have an open discussion about how to improve remaining imbalances and injustices they face as women; in particular the low participation of women in full-time employment is a political issue. In 2012, 76.9% of employed women worked part-time, well above the European Union average of 32.1%. By the early part of the 1990s, many women of Portugal became professionals, including being medical doctors and lawyers, a leap from many being merely office employees and factory workers. At present, many female Spaniards have left their customary status as homemakers to become active in the fields of business, professions, politics, and the military. According to swissinfo.ch in 2011, Switzerland's State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) were encouraging business companies to \\"appoint more women to top-level positions\\". Those who are already working in business companies, according to same report, mentions that \\"women earn on average 20% less than men\\" in Switzerland, and the ratio was 6 out of 10 women were working part-time.Wilton, Isabelle. Women still climbing to the top in business, swissinfo.ch, March 7, 2011 Abkhazian women are more active as participants in the realm of business and in activities related to establishing organizations for women in their country.Gogoryan, Anaid. \\"Four women in parliament not an achievement, but a disgrace\\", says leading member, Abkhazia's Women Lament Under-Representation, Caucasus, CRS Issue 583, March 18, 2011, iwpr.netAbkhazia’s Women Lament Under-Representation, Institute for War and Peace Reporting, March 18, 2011, unhcr.org (accessed on May 1, 2011) = Education = In the field of education, women in Italy tend to have highly favorable results and mainly excel in secondary and tertiary education. Ever since the Italian economic miracle, women's literacy rate and university subscription has gone up dramatically in Italy. Women in Italy have a 98% literacy rate, have a basic education and often go to university. 60% of Italian university graduates are female, and women are excellently represented in all academic subjects, including mathematics, information technology and other technological areas which are usually occupied by males.  Sexual harassment and gender based violence  Among the problems that confront Andorran women at present are the existence of violence against them, the absence of government departments that deal with issues about women, and the non-existence of shelters for battered women that are managed by the government of Andorra.

After disease incapacitated thousands of Army soldiers in the wake of the Siege of Santiago, high-ranking officers of Fifth Army Corps drafted a round- robin letter demanding that the unit be sent back to the United States. Public release of the letter embarrassed the U.S. government. By July 28, 1898, malaria and yellow fever were rife among U.S. Army troops garrisoned near Santiago de Cuba on the island of Cuba. Fifth Corps, to which the Rough Riders was attached, had 4,270 men seriously ill (and dying), and corps commanders feared the unit could be wiped out if it stayed in Cuba.Wintermute, p. 558. The McKinley administration, however, planned to keep the corps in Cuba until peace negotiations with Spain concluded. Public opinion was also against bringing home an army infected with yellow fever.Golay, p. 104. Several senior officers met with Major General William R. Shafter, commander of Fifth Corps, and unanimously asked that the corps be withdrawn to the United States. It is unclear whether Shafter agreed and asked for this in writing, or whether Shafter disagreed and the corps commanders decided to put their request in writing. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt (commander of the First Volunteer US Cavalry Rough Riders), the only non-general officer of the group, was asked by the rest of the group to draft a round-robin letter outlining the problems with living conditions and disease to send to Army Headquarters in Washington, D.C. The letter would also be deliberately leaked to the press. As a volunteer, Roosevelt's career would not be at stake in the way a regular army officer's would be by the communication. (Some sources say there is doubt that Roosevelt was the author, while others say that Roosevelt was only the author of the abridged letter.Golay, p. 105.) Nine generals and Roosevelt signed the letter. An abridged version was given to Shafter to present to the United States Secretary of War. Shafter declined to do so, but did communicate with his superiors about what was happening.\\"Round Robin\\", in Historical Dictionary of the Spanish American War, p. 284. The letter was deliberately leaked to Associated Press correspondents at corps headquarters, who cabled it to the U.S., where it was published nationwide. Publication of the round-robin letter turned public opinion against the War Department. The McKinley administration was outraged by the leak of the round-robin letter, but quickly realized that the public would blame the government. The administration acted swiftly to try to defuse the situation. On July 28, Secretary of War Russell A. Alger cabled Shafter and ordered Fifth Corps home to Camp Wikoff on Long Island, New York, for quarantine and mustering out. On August 3, the day before the letter appeared in the press, Alger ordered construction of barracks at Camp Wikoff to begin and for United States Navy ships to head to Cuba to retrieve Fifth Corps. The first units departed on August 7. Alger claimed that the round- robin letter did not accelerate administration plans to repatriate the corps. This appears disingenuous, however, as Alger had long asserted that naval ships were unavailable to bring the troops home.Lane, p. 283, fn. 22.

A related species, Formiscurra atlas occurs in southwestern Ethiopia. Like others of its family they have short wings, suck plant sap and escape by leaping. The species shows great sexual dimorphism. The male of this half centimeter-long insect has an enlarged lobe in front of its head, the frons or metope, giving it an ant-like appearance. Females do not have such an enlarged structure but have a slightly long snout and differ slightly in body shape. The species is found mainly on low vegetation in open scrub and grass habitats. Discovery Male on a blade of grass, Bangalore, India This species was described in 2011 on the basis of specimens collected from around southern India from as far back as 1978. The holotype was collected in the campus of the University of Agricultural Sciences at Bangalore in the state of Karnataka in India. Other specimens have been collected from a widely separated locations in southern India including Nagerhole, Dindigul, Mettupalayam and in Andhra Pradesh. The genus name is derived from the Latin word formica for ant and scurra for clown. Although no molecular phylogenetic studies have been conducted, the species is thought to be closely related to African forms like Afronaso and Populonia. Not much is known about the life history of the species and although the males are myrmecomorphic, the benefit of this ant-mimicry being limited to the male is not clearly understood. Male-limited Batesian mimicry is extremely rare. and in general, male-limited mimicry is rare (the other examples being a spider Coleosoma floridanum with an ant-like male and a jewel beetle Chrysobothris with males being mimetic). Description Dorsal view of male The male of Formiscurra indicus is about 5 mm long. The legs are long and the forelegs are sometimes raised when walking. The body is somewhat saddle shaped and the abdomen is slightly narrow at the base. The male has the frons (lower part of metope and upper part of post-clypeus) elongated and bulbous. The antenna has a long filament arising upward from the pedicel. The compound eyes are large and there are no ocelli. The short beak or rostrum is held underneath the body and the tip reaches the base of the hindleg. The female has a short tubular snout without the bulbous shape. The female lacks the narrowed waist and has the abdomen shaped as in more typical Caliscelids.

George Howard Building in 2014 Land use in Howard County has evolved over time. Roughly 60 percent of land in Howard County is dedicated, protected for rural uses, with the remaining 40 percent shifting over time from suburban to focused, mixed use nodes. Affluent Howard County offsets higher infrastructure costs of low- density development with high-valued homes that generate greater property and transfer taxes. The Department of Planning and Zoning provides staff and guidance to several citizen volunteer boards, including the Planning Board, Planning Board, the Agricultural Land Preservation Board the Historic District Commission, the Design Advisory Panel, and the Cemetery Preservation Advisory Board. The Director of the Department operates as executive secretary of the planning board with five members with five-year terms.

The film also stars Ken Jeong, Rob Corddry, Thomas Lennon, Tyler Labine, Paul Scheer, Calum Worthy, John Michael Higgins, and Ana Gasteyer. Plot Lindsey Lewis and her boyfriend Ben House are left on Earth after the rapture. The souls of the worthy have been taken to Heaven while everyone else has been left behind. The people left on Earth must fend for themselves in a world now plagued by evil locusts that constantly yell \\"suffer!\\", talking crows that use profanity, brimstone, wraiths, and storms that rain blood. A politician named Earl Gundy takes control of the government and begins calling himself The Beast. Lindsey's mother, a fervent Christian, was raptured but becomes the only person sent back after starting a fight in heaven. Her father is killed by one of the falling meteorites, and her brother Clark begins selling pot to the wraiths. Ben's father, an employee of The Beast, attempts to recruit Ben and Lindsey into working with The Beast. At first they refuse, but after their dream of opening a sandwich cart is literally crushed, they are forced to accept. On his day off, Ben's father begins to give them a \\"tour\\" around the Beast's mansion outside their hometown of Seattle. The mansion is heavily guarded by the Beastly Guards, the Beast's own private army of humans who made the deal with the Antichrist and the wraiths that serve his command. As warned by Ben's father, it is secretly loaded with land mines. The Beast, his guards, and his son Little Beast unexpectedly arrive, interrupting the tour. The Beast becomes smitten with Lindsey and pressures her to marry him and bear his evil children, giving her eight hours to decide before he will kill everyone she knows and loves. Lindsey consults a Bible and together with Ben hatches a plan to imprison The Beast. They are warned not to kill The Beast as he will just return as Satan. Ben's father had built an escape-proof dog kennel for their pet, so they decide to use it to hold The Beast. They hatch an elaborate plan to isolate The Beast from his guards and the wraiths. They enlist Lindsey's brother and their undead zombie neighbor Mr. Murphy to assist in the plan, and Lindsey returns to The Beast's mansion to be wooed. While Lindsey's brother and his friend smoke pot with the wraiths and their neighbor engages the guards in a distraction, Lindsey attempts to spike The Beast's drink. When he fails to drink it, she is forced to lure him to the pool so that Ben can help her. Outside, Lindsey begins yelling for Ben who arrives and challenges The Beast to a fight. After mocking Ben, The Beast pulls a gun and attempts to shoot him before Lindsey intervenes. The Beast knocks Ben out with a champagne bottle before being shot by Lindsey. As Ben comes back around, The Beast begins to recover. Lindsey begins shooting him again as Ben brings her more guns. Out of ammunition, they resort to bludgeoning him with a shovel before Ben decides to try and shoot him with a giant poolside laser that The Beast had installed. As Lindsey and Ben try to aim the laser they are blinded by a light coming from the sky. Ben is startled to see a man in white riding a winged horse and shoots him in panic, killing him and the horse. Ben and Lindsey slowly realize that they've accidentally shot Jesus Christ. There is suddenly lightning from the sky, and the pair are confronted by a man in a white suit whom they realize is God. God angrily explains that Ben and Lindsey have ruined his entire plan involving the fate of all mankind by killing Jesus. Ben and Lindsey at first apologize, but God begins mocking and insulting them. The Beast revives as Satan and sneaks up on God, waylaying him with a shovel and starting a fistfight between the two. The fight spills over into the hot tub, where Satan deliberately drops a boombox in the water and electrocutes them both. The Beast's guards drive up and see the two bodies. Ben's dad arrives and the men begin arguing over who will take The Beast's place as ruler of the world. Lindsey interrupts to point out with God and Satan dead, everyone is now in charge of themselves. Lindsey and Ben kiss as the men decide what to do now that they are free. Ben and Lindsey finally open their own sandwich shop (which turns into a thriving lunch destination) and Lindsey is shown visibly pregnant with their child. Little Beast is now happily working with them. Lindsey's mother has made friends with some of the wraiths that are still around and is shown smoking pot with them. Ben's father moves into the mansion and throws a huge party with many other people including Morgan, the Beast's former right-hand man and leader of the now-disbanded Beastly Guards, as they celebrate their freedom with barbeque and salsa loaded with PCP.

Biblical sources While there is no explicit prohibition in the written Torah for carrying objects between domains on the Sabbath, according to traditional Jewish commentators,See Rashi and Ibn Ezra on the Torah. Talmud Eruvin 17b this category of melakha (work) is mentioned in : :\\"Let no man go out from his place on the seventh day\\" According to the Talmud, the manna could not be collected on Sabbath because it could not be carried into the Israelites' homes. Another rabbinically quoted verse is : :Moses commanded, and a message was propagated in the camp saying, Let no man or woman do any more work for the holy donation, and the people ceased to bring. The Talmud understands the latter verse to refer to the people ceasing to carry their donations from their personal domains to the sanctuary, on Shabbat.Shabbos 96b Likewise according to the Talmud, the wood-gatherer in was executed because he violated the prohibition of transferring wood between domains.Shabbos 96b The book of Jeremiah is more explicit: :Thus says the LORD: Take heed for the sake of your souls, and carry no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; nor carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day, nor do any work; but rather make holy the Sabbath day - as I commanded your fathers, but they listened not, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction. And it shall be if you listen to Me, says the LORD, not to bring any burden into the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, and to make holy the Sabbath day not to perform any labor on it. Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on David's throne, riding in chariots and with horses, they and their princes the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and this city shall be inhabited forever. () The latter quote specifies two types of carrying which are forbidden - carrying into the gates of Jerusalem, or out of an individual's house. Domains According to halacha, all areas are divided into four categories:Talmud Bavli, Shabbat 6a. The Talmud Yerushalmi has a slightly different list of four categories.Shulchan Aruch, Orach Haim 345:1 * A private domain (Reshut HaYachid) * A public domain, or thoroughfare (Reshut HaRabbim) * An open area (Karmelit) * An exempt area (Makom Petur) The open area is defined as not bounded by walls or fences, and which also is not traversed by large numbers of people. By the Torah, the open area is considered an exempt area; however rabbinic enactments treat it more strictly.Makom Patur ve'Carmelit Two activities are biblically forbidden: * Transferring an object from a private domain to a public thoroughfare, or vice versa.Mishneh Torah, Shabbat 12:9 * Transferring an object a distance of 4 cubits in a public thoroughfare.Mishneh Torah, Shabbat 12:8 In addition, three activities are rabbinically forbidden: * Transferring an object from a private domain to an open area, or vice versa. * Transferring an object a distance of 4 cubits in an open area. * Transferring an object between two different private domains. The following activities are permitted: * Transferring an object within a single private domain. * Transferring an object between an exempt area and any other domains. However, it is sometimes forbidden to use an exempt area as a \\"stopover\\" when the intent is to transfer between two other domains. * Transferring an object across multiple open areas, as long as the total distance carried is less than 4 cubits. Methods of transfer The Torah law of hotzaah is violated only if a single person picks up an object (akirah) in one domain and deposits it (hanacha) in another domain (or at a distance of 4 cubits, as applicable). This has the following implications: * If a person picks up an object and begins walking, the Torah law has not been violated until he stops walking (stopping while holding an object is considered tantamount to depositing the object). Even a brief pause to rest is considered a hanacha which causes Torah law to be violated.Mishneh Torah, Shabbat 13:9 * If a person did not pick up an object at all, but rather the object was deposited in his hands by another person while he was walking, he does not violate Torah law even after stopping, as he never performed akirah. * If two people carried an object together (such as two people lifting opposite ends of a box), neither one has violated Torah law. However, this is rabbinically forbidden. * If a person picked up an object in a private domain, exited to a public domain, continued walking to another private domain, and deposited the object there - he has not violated Torah law. This is because he never picked up or deposited the object in the public domain, so there was no forbidden transfer between public and private domains. Of course, if at any point while walking in the public domain he stopped momentarily, that would cause Torah law to be violated. In any case, transfer between two different private domains violates rabbinic law. If a person, while walking, lets the object he is holding approach within three handbreadths of the ground, it is considered as if the object has been placed on the ground. This can generate additional violations of Torah law. This is due to the principle of lavud, also used when constructing a sukkah. Throwing an object from one domain to another has the same rules as carrying the object between those domains.
