The kingdom was founded by Mayurasharma in c. 345, and at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions. An indication of their imperial ambitions is provided by the titles and epithets assumed by its rulers, and the marital relations they kept with other kingdoms and empires, such as the Vakatakas and Guptas of northern India. Mayurasharma defeated the armies of the Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with the help of some native tribes and claimed sovereignty. The Kadamba power reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma. The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with autonomy. From the mid-6th century the dynasty continued to rule as a vassal of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties. Notable among these are the Kadambas of Goa, the Kadambas of Halasi and the Kadambas of Hangal. During the pre-Kadamba era the ruling families that controlled the Karnataka region, the Mauryas and later the Satavahanas, were not natives of the region and therefore the nucleus of power resided outside present-day Karnataka. The Kadambas were the first indigenous dynasty to use Kannada, the language of the soil at an administrative level. In the history of Karnataka, this era serves as a broad-based historical starting point in the study of the development of region as an enduring geo-political entity and Kannada as an important regional language. History Origin Old Kannada inscriptions of Kadamba king Kamadeva of the Hangal branch (c.1180) and Hoysala king Veera Ballala II (c. 1196) in the open mantapa of the Tarakeshwara temple at Hangal There are several legends regarding the origin of the Kadambas. According to one such legend the originator of this dynasty was a three-eyed four-armed warrior called Trilochana Kadamba (the father of Mayurasharma) who emerged from the sweat of the god Shiva under a Kadamba tree. Another legend tries to simplify it by claiming Mayurasharma himself was born to Shiva and Bhudevi (goddess of the earth). Other legends tie them without any substance to the Nagas, and the Nandas of northern India. An inscription of c.1189 claims that Kadamba Rudra the founder of the kingdom was born in a forest of Kadamba trees. As he had \\"peacock feather\\" like reflections on his limbs, he was called Mayuravarman.Majumdar (1986), p.237 From the Talagunda inscription, one more legend informs that the founding king of the dynasty, Mayurasharma was anointed by \\"the six-faced god of war Skanda\\".Mann (2011), p. 227 Historians are divided on the issue of the geographical origin of the Kadambas, whether they were of local origin or earlier immigrants from northern India.Chaurasia (2002), p.252 The social order (caste) of the Kadamba family is also an issue of debate, whether the founders of the kingdom belonged to the Brahmin caste as described by the Talagunda inscription, or of local tribal origin. Historians Chopra et al. claim the Kadambas were none other than the Kadambu tribe who were in conflict with the Chera kingdom (of modern Kerala) during the Sangam era. The Kadambus find mention in the Sangam literature as totemic worshipers of the Kadambu tree and the Hindu god Subramanya. According to R.N. Nandi, since the inscription states the family got its name by tending to the totem tree that bore the beautiful Kadamba flowers, it is an indication of their tribal origin.Chopra, Ravindran & Subrahmanian (2003), p. 161R.N. Nandi in Adiga (2006), p. 93 However the historians Sastri and Kamath claim the family belonged to the Brahmin caste, believed in the Vedas and performed Vedic sacrifices. According to the Talagunda and the Gudnapur inscriptions, they belonged to the Manavya Gotra and were HaritiputrƒÅs (\\"descendants of Hariti lineage\\"), which connected them to the native Chutus of Banavasi, a vassal of the Satavahana empire.Sastri (1955), p.99 According to Rao and Minahan, being native Kannadigas, the Kadambas promptly gave administrative and political importance to their language Kannada after coming to power.Rao, Seshagiri in Amaresh Datta (1988), p. 1717Minahan (2012), p. 124 Birth of Kingdom One of their earliest inscriptions, the Talagunda inscription of crown prince Santivarma (c.450) gives what may be the most possible cause for the emergence of the Kadamba kingdom. It states that Mayurasharma was a native of Talagunda, (in present-day Shimoga district of Karnataka state) and his family got its name from the Kadamba tree that grew near his home.Kamath, S.U. (1980), p.30 The inscription narrates how Mayurasharma proceeded to Kanchi in c.345 along with his guru and grandfather Veerasharma to pursue his Vedic studies at a Ghatika (\\"school\\"). There, owing to some misunderstanding between him and a Pallava guard or at an Ashvasanstha (\\"horse sacrifice\\"), a quarrel arose in which Mayurasharma was humiliated. Enraged, the Brahmin discontinued his studies, left Kanchi swearing vengeance on the Pallavas and took to arms. He collected a faithful group of followers and routed the Pallava armies near the Srisailam region. After a prolonged period of low intensity warfare against the Pallavas and other smaller kings such as the Brihad-Banas of Kolar region, he proclaimed independence. Unable to contain Mayurasharma, the Pallavas had to accept his sovereignty.Kamath, S.U. (1980), pp. 30‚Äì31Sen (1999), p. 468 The Talagunda inscription also confirms Mayurasharma was the progenitor of the kingdom.Ramesh, K.V. (1984), p. 6Sastri (1955), pp. 99‚Äì100Chopra, Ravindran & Subrahmanian (2003), pp.26, 161‚Äì162 The inscription gives a graphic description of the happenings after the Kanchi incident: Thus, according to Ramesh, in an act of righteous indignation was born the first native kingdom of Karnataka, and the Pallava King Skandavarman condescended to recognize the growing might of the Kadambas south of the Malaprabha river as a sovereign power.Ramesh, K.V. (1984), p. 3 Majumdar however feels even an inscription as important as the Talagunda pillar inscription leaves many a detail unanswered.Majumdar (1986), pp. 235‚Äì237 Scholars such as Moraes and Sastri opine that Mayurasharma may have availed himself of the confusion in the south that was created by the invasion of Samudragupta who in his Allahabad inscription claims to have defeated Pallava King Vishnugopa of Kanchi. Taking advantage of the weakening of the Pallava power, Mayurasharma appears to have succeeded in establishing a new kingdom. According to epigraphist M.H. Krishna, Mayurasharma further subdued minor rulers such as the Traikutas, the Abhiras, the Pariyathrakas, the Shakasthanas, the Maukharis, the Punnatas and the Sendrakas.Kamath, S.U. (1980), p.31. The fact that Mayurasharma had to travel to distant Kanchi for Vedic studies gives an indication that Vedic lore was quite rudimentary in the Banavasi region at that time. The Gudnapur inscription which was discovered by epigraphist B.R. Gopal states that Mauryasharma, whose grandfather and preceptor was Veerasharma and his father was Bandhushena, developed the character of a Kshatriya (warrior caste). Sen feels the successor of Mayurasharma, Kangavarma changed his surname from \\"Sharma\\" to \\"Varma\\".Sen (1999), p. 468 Expansion Mayurasharma was succeeded by his son Kangavarma in c. 365. He had to fight the Vakataka might to protect his kingdom (also known as Kuntala country). According to Jouveau-Dubreuil he was defeated by the King Prithvisena but managed to maintain his freedom. Majumdar feels Kangavarma battled with King Vidyasena of the Basin branch of the Vakataka kingdom with no permanent results.Kamath, S.U. (1980), p. 32Sastri (1955), p. 100Majumdar (1986), p. 239 His son Bhageerath who came to power in c.390 is said to have retrieved his fathers losses. According to Kamath, the Talagunda inscription describes Bhageerath as the sole \\"lord of the Kadamba land\\" and the \\"great Sagara\\" (lit, \\"great Ocean\\") himself indicating he may have retrieved their losses against the Vakatakas. But contemporary though Vakataka inscriptions do not confirm this. His son Raghu died fighting the Pallavas in c. 435 though some inscriptions claim he secured the kingdom for his family. He was succeeded by his younger brother Kakusthavarma in c.435. Kakusthavarma was the most powerful ruler of the dynasty. According to Sastri and Moraes, under the rule Kakusthavarma, the kingdom reached its pinnacle of success and the Talagunda record calls him the \\"ornament of the family\\". The Halasi and Halmidi inscriptions also hold him in high esteem.Sastri (1955), p. 101Majumdar (1986), p.240 From the Talagunda inscription it is known that he maintained marital relations with even such powerful ruling families as the imperial Guptas of the northern India. One of his daughters was married to King Madhava of the Ganga dynasty. According to the Desai one of his daughters was married to Kumara Gupta's son Skanda Gupta (of the Gupta dynasty), and from Balaghat inscription of Vakataka king Prithvisena we know another daughter called Ajitabhattarika was married to the Vakataka prince Narendrasena.Kamath, S.U. (1980), p. 33Sen (1999), p. 244 He maintained similar relations with the Bhatari vassal and the Alupas of South Canara. According to Desai and Panchamukhi evidence from Sanskrit literature indicates that during this time the notable Sanskrit poet Kalidasa visited the Kadamba court. Moraes and Sen feel the visit happened during the reign of Bhageerath. According to Sen, Kalidasa was sent by Chandragupta II Virakmaditya to conclude a marriage alliance with the Kadambas.Majumdar (1986), p.239 His successor Santivarma (c. 455) was known for his personal charm and beauty. According to an inscription he wore three crowns (pattatraya) to display his prosperity, thus \\"attracting the attention of his enemies\\", the Pallavas. When the Pallava threat loomed, He divided his kingdom in c.455 and let his younger brother Krishnavarma rule over the southern portion and deal with the Pallavas. The branch is called the Triparvata branch and ruled from either Devagiri in the modern Dharwad district or Halebidu. Majumdar considers Krishnavarma's rule as somewhat obscure due to lack of his inscriptions though the records issued by his sons credit him with efficient administration and an ashvamedha (horse sacrifice). It is known that he possibly lost his life in battle with the Pallavas. According to the Hebbatta record his successor and son Vishnuvarma had to accept the suzerainty of the Pallavas despite showing initial allegiance to his uncle Santivarma ruling from Banavasi whom he described in an earlier record as \\"lord of the entire Karnata country\\".Majumdar (1986), pp. 241‚Äì242Sastri (1955), p. 101Kamath, S.U. (1980), pp. 34, 53 In c.485, his son Simhavarma came to power but maintained a low profile relationship with Banavasi. In the northern part of the kingdom (the Banavasi branch), Santivarma's brother Shiva Mandhatri ruled from c.460 for more than a decade. In c. 475 Santivarma's son Mrigeshavarma came to the throne and faced the Pallavas and Gangas with considerable success. The Halasi plates describes him the \\"destroyer of the eminent family of the Gangas\\" and the \\"destructive fire\\" (pralayaanala) to the Pallavas. His queen Prabhavati of the Kekaya family bore him a son called Ravivarma. Mrigeshavarma was known to be a scholar and an expert in riding horses and elephants.Majumdar (1986), p.243 After Kakusthavarma only Ravivarma (c. 485) was able to build the kingdom back to its original might during a long rule lasting up to c. 519. Numerous inscriptions from his rule, starting from fifth up to the thirty- fifth regnal years give a vivid picture of his successes which was marked by a series of clashes within the family, and also against the Pallavas and the Gangas. He is credited with a victory against the Vakatakas as well. A Mahadeva temple constructed during his rule finds mention in a Greek writing of the period. According to the Gudnapur inscription, lesser rulers such as the Punnatas, the Alupas, the Kongalvas and the Pandyas of Uchangi were dealt with successfully. The crux of the kingdom essentially consisted of significant areas of the deccan including large parts of modern Karnataka. King Ravivarma of the Banavasi branch killed king Vishnuvarma of the Triparvata branch according to Moraes and successfully dealt with a rebelling successors of Shiva Mandhatri at Ucchangi. The Pallava king Chandadanda (another name for Pallava king Santivarman) also met the same fate according to Sathianathaier. Ravivarma left two of his brothers, Bhanuvarma and Shivaratha to govern from Halasi and Ucchangi.Kamath, S.U. (1980), p. 34Majumdar (1986), p.245 Decline After Ravivarma's death, he was succeeded by his peaceful son Harivarma in c. 519 according to the Sangolli inscription. According to the Bannahalli plates, Harivarma was killed by a resurgent Krishnavarma II (son of Simhavarma) of the Triparvata branch around c.530 when he raided Banavasi, thus uniting the two branches of the kingdom. Around c.540 the Chalukyas who were vassals of the Kadambas and governed from Badami conquered the entire kingdom. The Kadambas thereafter became vassals of the Badami Chalukyas.Kamath, S.U. (1980), p. 35Majumdar (1986), p. 246 In later centuries, the family fragmented into numerous minor branches and ruled from Goa, Halasi, Hangal, Vainad, Belur, Bankapura, Bandalike, Chandavar and Jayantipura (in Odisha).Kamath, S.U. (1980), p.38 That the Kadambas of Banavasi were a prosperous kingdom is attested to by the famous Aihole inscription of the Chalukyas which describes Banavasi in these terms: Administration Old Kannada inscription (1200 AD) of King Kamadeva of the Kadamba dynasty of the Hangal branch The Kadamba kings, like their predecessors the Shatavanahas, called themselves Dharmamaharajas (lit, \\"Virtuous kings\\") and followed them closely in their administrative procedures. The kings were well read and some were even scholars and men of letters. Inscriptions describe the founding king Mayurasharma as \\"Vedangavaidya Sharada\\" (\\"master of the Vedas\\"), Vishnuvarma was known for his proficiency in grammar and logic, and Simhavarma was called \\"skilled in the art of learning\\".Kamath, S.U. (1980), p.35 This wisdom and knowledge from the ancient Hindu texts called (the Smritis) provided guidance in governance. Mores identified several important positions in the government: the prime minister (Pradhana), steward of household (Manevergade), secretary of council (Tantrapala or Sabhakarya Sachiva), scholarly elders (Vidyavriddhas), physician (Deshamatya), private secretary (Rahasyadhikritha), chief secretary (Sarvakaryakarta), chief justice (Dharmadhyaksha) above whom was the king himself, other officials (Bhojaka and Ayukta), revenue officers (Rajjukas) and the writers and scribes (Lekhakas). The Gavundas formed the elite land owners who were the intermediaries between the king and the farmers collecting taxes, maintaining revenue records and providing military support to the royal family.Adiga (2006), p. 168 The army consisted of officers such as Jagadala, Dandanayaka and Senapathi. The organization was based on the strategy called \\"Chaurangabala\\". Guerrilla warfare was not unknown and may have been used often to gain tactical advantage.Kamath, S.U. (1980), pp. 35‚Äì36 A crown prince (Yuvaraja) from the royal family often helped the king in central administration at the royal capital. Some governed in the far off provinces. This experience not only provided future security and know-how for the king to be, but also kept administration controls within trusted family members. This is seen in the case of kings Shantivarma, Kakusthavarma and Krishnavarma. King Kakusthavarma had appointed his son Krishnavarma as viceroy of Triparvatha region. King Ravivarma's brothers Bhanu and Shivaratha governed over Halasi and Uchangi provinces respectively. Some regions continued to be under hereditary ruling families such as the Alupas, the Sendrakas, the Kekeyas and the Bhataris. While Banavasi was the nerve center of power, Halasi, Triparvata and Uchangi were important regional capitals. The kingdom was divided into provinces (Mandalas or Desha). Under a province was a district (Vishayas), nine of which have been identified by Panchamukhi. Under a district was a Taluk (Mahagramas) comprising numerous villages under which were the villages in groups of ten (Dashagrama). The smallest unit was the village (Grama) which appears to have enjoyed particular freedoms under the authority of headman (Gramika).Kamath, S.U. (1980), p. 35) Apart from the various divisions and sub-divisions of the kingdom, there was a concept of urban settlement. The fifth-century Birur copper plate inscription of king Vishnuvarma describes Banavasi as \\"the ornament of Karnata desa, adorned with eighteen mandapikas\\" (toll collection centers) indicating it was a major trade center at that time. Numerous inscriptions make reference to the rulers at Banavasi as \\"excellent lords of the city\\" (puravaresvara). Excavations have revealed that Banavasi was a settlement even during the Shatavahana period. By the fifth century, it was a fortified settlement and the Kadamba capital (Kataka). A later inscriptions of c.692 of the Chalukyas refer to Banavasi and its corporate body (Nagara) as a witness to the granting of a village to a Brahmin by the monarch. A reference to the mercantile class (Setti) further indicates the commercial importance of Banavasi.Adiga (2006), pp. 74, 85 One sixth of land produce was collected as tax. Other taxes mentioned in inscriptions were the levy on land (Perjunka), social security tax paid to the royal family (Vaddaravula), sales tax (Bilkoda), land tax (Kirukula), betel tax (Pannaya) and professional taxes on traders such as oilmen, barbers and carpenters. Inscriptions mention many more taxes such as internal taxes (Kara and anthakara), tax on eleemosynary holdings (panaga), presents to kings (Utkota) and cash payments (Hiranya). The capital Banavasi had eighteen custom houses (mandapika) that levied taxes on incoming goods.Adiga (2006), p. 216 In recognition of military or protective service provided by deceased warriors, the state made social service grants (Kalnad or Balgacu) that supported their family. In addition to erecting a hero stone which usually included an inscription extolling the virtues of the hero, the grant would be in the form of land. Such land grant could be as small as a plot, as large as several villages, or even a large geographical unit depending on the heroes status.Adiga (2006), p. 177 Economy Inscriptions and literature are the main source of information about the economy and the factors that influenced it. According to Adiga, from studies conducted by historians and epigraphists such as Krishna, Kalburgi, Kittel, Rice, B.R. Gopal and Settar, it is clear the kingdom depended on revenues from both agricultural and pastoral elements. Numerous inscriptions, mainly from the modern Shimoga, Bijapur, Belgaum, Dharwad and Uttara Kannada regions (the ancient divisions of Belvola-300, Puligere-300, Banavasi-12,000) mention cattle raids, cowherds and shepherds. The numerous hero stones to those who fought in cattle raids was an indication of not only lawlessness but also of the importance of herding. The mention of the terms gosai (female goyiti), gosasa, gosasi and gosahasra in the adjective, the imposition of taxes on milk and milk products, the existence of large cattle herds and the gifting of a thousand cows as a mark of the donors affluence (gosahasram pradarum) indicate cow herding was an important part of the economy.Adiga (2006), pp. 55‚Äì67 There are records that mention the shepherd settlements (kuripatti), cowherd settlements (turpatti) and numerous references to small hamlets (palli).Adiga (2006), pp. 36‚Äì87 Mixed farming, a combination of grazing and cultivation, mostly controlled by the wealthy Gavunda peasantry (today's Gowdas), seems to be the thing to do, for both the quantum of grain produced and number of cattle head determined opulence. There are several records that mention the donation of both gracing and cultivable land in units of kolagas or khandugas to either those who fought cattle thieves or to their families. A nomadic way of life is not prevalent in most communities, with the exception of hill tribes called Bedas. A semi-nomadic community, according to Durrett, they frequently depended on cattle thieving from outlying farms and the abduction of women. The Bedas subsisted by selling to merchants stolen cattle and such produce from the forest as meat, sandalwood and timber, and crops from disorganized agriculture.Adiga (2006), pp. 65‚Äì67 From inscriptions three types of land are evident; wet or cultivable land (nansey, bede, gadde or nir mannu) usually used to cultivate paddy (called akki gadde,akki galdege or bhatta mannu) or a tall stout grain yielding grass called sejje; dry land (punsey, rarely mentioned) and garden land (totta). A sixth-century grant refers to garden land that grew sugarcane (iksu). Other crops that were also cultivated were barley (yava), areca nut (kramuka), fallow millet (joladakey), wheat (godhuma), pulses (radaka), flowers were mostly for temple use and such lands called pundota, fruits such as plantains (kadali) and coconuts are also mentioned.Adiga (2008), pp. 47‚Äì55 Village (palli) descriptions in lithic and copper plate records, such as the Hiresakuna 6th-century copper plates from Soraba, included its natural (or man made) bounding landmarks, layout of agricultural fields, repairs to existing and newly constructed water tanks, irrigation channels and streams, soil type and the crops grown.Adiga (2006), pp. 21‚Äì22 Repairs to tanks and construction of new ones was a preoccupation of elite, from kings to the Mahajanas, who claimed partial land ownership or a percentage of produce irrigated from the tank or both. Taxes were levied on newly irrigated lands, an indication the rulers actively encourage the conversion of dry land to cultivable wet land.Adiga (2006), p. 45 An important distinction is made between types of landholdings: Brahmadeya (individual) and non-Brahmadeya (collective) and this is seen in inscriptions as early as the third-fourth century in South India. Records such as the Shikaripura Taluk inscription indicate occasionally women were village headmen and counselors, and held land (gavundi).Singh, Upendra (2008), p. 593 Functioning purely on the excess produce of the rural hinterland were the urban centers, the cities and towns (mahanagara, pura, and Polal) that often find mention in Kannada classics such as Vaddaradhane (c. 900) and Pampa Bharata (c. 940). References to townships with specialized classes of people such as the diamond and cloth merchants and their shops, merchant guilds (corporate bodies), important temples of worship and religious hubs, palaces of the royalty, vassals and merchants (setti), fortifications, courtesan streets, and grain merchants and their markets are a clear indication that these urban entities were the centers of administrative, religious and economic activity.Adiga (2006), pp. 71‚Äì86 Culture =Religion= The end of the Shatavahana rule in the third century coincided with the advent of two religious phenomena in the Deccan and South India: the spread of Brahminical Hinduism, and Jainism and Buddhism. This was a direct result of the Gupta dynasties ardent patronage to Hinduism in northern India and their aversion to other religions.Chopra, Ravindran & Subrahmanian ((2003), p.188 According to Sastri, till about the fifth century, South India witnessed a harmonious growth of these religions and the sects related to them without hindrance. Appeasement of local deities and local practices which included offerings of sacrifices often went alongside popular Vedic gods such as Muruga, Shiva, Vishnu and Krishna.Sastri (1955), pp. 381‚Äì382 However, from the seventh century onward, the growing popularity of Jainism and Buddhism became a cause for concern to the Hindu saints who saw the growth of these new faiths as heretic to mainstream Hinduism. This new found Hindu resurgence, especially in Tamil country, was characterized by public debates and enthusiastic rebuttals by itinerant saints. Their main purpose was to energize and revive Hindu Bhakti among the masses and bring back followers of sects considered primitive, such as the Kalamukhas, Kapalikas and Pasupatas, into mainstream Hinduism.Chopra, Ravindran & Subrahmanian (2003), p. 189Sastri (1955), p. 382 The Kadambas were followers of Vedic Hinduism as evidenced by their inscriptions. The situation was the same with their immediate neighbors, the Gangas and the Pallavas. According to Adiga, their patronage to Brahmins well versed in the Vedas is all too evident. Inscriptions narrate various land grants to Brahmins that specify their lineage (gotra) as well as Vedic specialization.Adiga (2006), pp.280-281 According to Sircar, the early rulers called themselves Brahmanya or Parama-brahmanya, an indication of their propensity toward Vaishnavism (a branch of Hinduism).Sircar (1971), p.54 The founding king Mayurasharma was, according to the Talagunda inscription, a Brahmin by birth though his successors may have assumed the surnameVarma to indicate their change to Kshatriya (warrior) status. An inscription of Vishnuvarma describes him as the \\"protector of the excellent Brahmana faith\\". His father Krishnavarma-I performed the Vedic ashvamedha (\\"Horse sacrifice\\"). There are numerous records that record grants made to Brahmins. According to Sircar, some fifth and sixth century inscriptions have an invocation of Hari- Hara-Hiranyagarbha and Hara-Narayana Brahman (Hari and Hara are another name of the Hindu gods Vishnu and Shiva).Kamath, S.U. (1980), pp. 36‚Äì37Sircar (1971), p.53 The Talagunda inscription starts with an invocation of the Hindu god Shiva while the Halmidi and Banavasi inscriptions start with an invocation of the god Vishnu. Madhukeshvara (a form of Shiva) was their family deity and numerous donations were made to the notable Madhukeshvara temple in Banavasi. Inscriptions mention various Shaiva sects (worshipers of the god Shiva) such as Goravas, Kapalikas, Pasupatas and Kalamukhas. Famous residential schools of learning existed in Balligavi and Talagunda. Vedic education was imparted in places of learning called Agrahara and Ghatika. However, they were tolerant to other faiths. The Kadamba kings appear to have encouraged Jainism as well. Some records of King Mrigeshavarma indicate describe donations to Jain temples and that King Ravivarma held a Jain scholar in high esteem. Names of such noted Jain preceptors as Pujyapada, Niravadya Pandita and Kumaradatta find mention in their inscriptions. Jainas occupied commanding posts of importance in their armies. According to Adiga, image worship, which was originally prohibited, was now popularized among the common man and the monks. This helped raise funds for the construction of Jain temples (Chaitya). Installation of images of Jain monks (Jaina) in temples and a steady move toward ritualistic worship among the laymen undermined the concept of \\"quest for salvation\\" and the ascetic vigor of the religion.Adiga 92006), pp. 249‚Äì252 Grants were made to Buddhist centers as well. According to Kamath, the royal capital Banavasi had long been a place of Buddhist learning. In the seventh century, the Chinese embassy Hieun-Tsang described Banavasi as a place of one hundred Sangharamas where ten thousand scholars of both the Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism lived. However, according to Ray, while there is evidence to prove that certain pre-Kadamba royal families, such as the Mauryas and Chutus may have patronized Buddhism, there is not much to say regarding the ruling Kadamba family, vast majority of whose inscriptions are Brahminical grants. In fact, according to Ray, the traces of Buddhist stupa sites that have been discovered in Banavasi are located outside the town.Ray (2019), Chapter- Introduction, Section-Perception: Buddhist Banavasi, Past and Present =Society= The caste system was prevalent in the organized Hindu society with the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas at the top. This had a deep impact on such socially important events as marriage. Even Jainism and Buddhism which initially found popularity by avoiding social hierarchy began to develop the trappings of a caste-based society. This particular feature was, according to Singh, a unique feature of Jainism in what is modern-day Karnataka during the early medieval period. Both the sects of Jainism, the Digambara and the Svetambara followed a strict qualification process for persons worthy of initiation. Jinasena's classic Adipurana counts purity of ancestry, physical health and soundness of mind as the main attributes that made a person worthy of such initiation. Both Jinasena and Ravisena (author of Padmapurana) discuss the existence of a varna (distinction or caste) based society and the responsibilities of each varna.Singh, R.B.P. (2008), pp. 72‚Äì73 Majumdar notes that the Buddhist and Jain literature of the period accounts for the four varna by placing the Kshatriya above the Brahmin. While the Brahminical literature points to a tradition that permitted a Brahmin man to marry a woman of Kshatriya caste, a Brahmin woman was not allowed to marry a non-Brahmin man. Just the contrary seems to be the case with Buddhist and Jain literature which deema the marriage of a Brahmin man to Kshatriya woman as unacceptable but that of a Kshatriya man to a Brahmin woman as acceptable. Thus a caste system was in play with all the three main religions of the times.Majumdar (1977), pp. 201‚Äì202 However, Majumdar does point out the highly assimilate nature of the Hindu society where all the early invaders into India, such as the Kushans, the Greeks, the Sakas and the Parthians were all absorbed into the Hindu society without a trace of their earlier practices.Majumdar (1977), pp. 202‚Äì203 A unique feature of medieval Indian society was the commemoration of the deceased hero by the erection of memorial stones (\\"hero stone\\"). These stones, the inscriptions and relief sculptures on them were meant to deify the fallen hero. According to Upendra Singh, The largest concentration of such stones, numbering about 2650 and dated to between the fifth and thirteenth centuries, are found in the modern Karnataka region of India. While most were dedicated to men, a few interesting ones are dedicated to women and pets. The Siddhenahalli, the Kembalu and the Shikaripura hero stones extol the qualities of women who lost their lives fighting cattle rustlers or enemies. The Gollarahatti and the Atakur inscription are in memory of a dog that died fighting wild boar, and the Tambur inscription of a Kadamba king of the Goa branch describes his death from sorrow of losing his pet parrot to a cat,Singh, Upendra, (2008), p. 48 and the Kuppatur stone was in memory of a bonded servant who was given the honorific \\"slayer of the enemy\\" (ripu-mari) for bravely fighting and killing a man-eater Tiger with his club before succumbing to his injuries.Kamat, J.K. (1980), p. 79 According to Altekar, the practice of sati appears to have been adopted well after the Vedic period, because there was no sanction for the practice in the funeral hymns of the Rig Veda. According to him, even in the Atharva Veda, there is only a passing reference of widow being required to lie by the side of her husband's corpse on the funeral pyre, then alight from it before it was lit, for the chanting of hymns to commence that blessed her with future wealth and children. This was an indication that window remarriage was in vogue.Altekar (1956), pp. 117‚Äì118 Altekar points out that even the authors of the Dharmasutras (400 BCE ‚Äì c. 100)and the Smritis (c.100-c.300), such as Manu and Yagnavalkya, do not make any mention of any ritual resembling sati in their description of the duties of women and widows in society, but rather prescribed the path of worldly renunciation as worthy.Altekar (1956), p.119 It is from about c. 400 that the practice of sati begins to appear in the literature of Vatsyayana, Bhasa (Dutagatotkacha and Urubhanga), Kalidasa (Kumarasambhava) and Shudraka (Mirchchhakatika), with a real case in c. 510 when deceased general Goparaja's wife immolated herself on her husband's pyre. Then around 606, the mother of King Harshavardhana decided to predecease her terminally ill husband.Altekar (1956), p. 123 This however did not find immediate support with noted poets such as Bana (c.625) and other tantra writers who considered sati inhuman and immoral.Altekar (1956), pp. 124‚Äì125 However around c. 700, the tide began to turn in northern India, especially in Kashmir, but found a later stronghold in Rajasthan. The belief in sati began to appeal, especially to the warrior classes, and the theory that performing sati cleansed the deceased husband of earthly sins and assured the couple a place in heaven caught on.Altekar (1956), p. 127 Occasionally concubines, mothers, sisters, sisters-in-law and even ministers, servants and nurses joined in the act. This took its time to reach the Deccan (Kadamba territory) and the deep south (Tamil country) where the earliest cases, voluntary as they were, are seen by about c.1000.Altekar (1956), p. 128 What was once a Kshatriya only practice came to be adopted by the Brahmins and even some Jains from around c. 1000.Altekar (1956), pp. 128‚Äì129 In the modern Karnataka region (Kadamba territory), there are only eleven cases between c.1000-c.1400 and forty-one cases between c.1400 ‚Äì c.1600, mostly in the warrior communities indicating an overall lack of appeal.Altekar (1956), pp. 130‚Äì131 Physical education was very popular with men. The book Agnipurana encouraged men to avoid calisthenics with either partially digested food in their body or on a full stomach. Bathing with cold water after exercises was considered unhealthy. Medieval sculptures depict youth in physical combat training, doing gymnastics such as lifting the weight of the body with both hands, and doing muscular exercises such as bending a crowbar.Kamat, J.K. (1980), p. 68 The terms malla and jatti occur often in literature indicating wrestling was a popular sport with the royalty and the commoners. Wrestlers of both genders existed, the woman fighters meant purely for the entertainment to a male audience. Several kings had titles such as ahavamalla (\\"warrior-wrestler\\"), tribhuvanamalla (\\"wrestler of the three worlds\\"). The book Akhyanakamanikosa refers to two types of combative sports, the mushtiyuddha (\\"fist-fight\\") and mallayuddha (or mallakalaga, \\"wrestling fight\\"). Wrestlers were distinguished based on their body weight, age, skill, proficiency and stamina. Those who exemplified themselves were recognized and maintained on specific diets.Kamat, J.K. (1980), p. 69 Much of the information we get about activities such as archery and hunting is from classics such as the Agni Purana (post 7th century) and others. The Agni Purana says \\"one who has made the vision of both of his mental and physical eyes steady can conquer even the god of death\\".Kamat, J.K. (1980), p.74 An archers proficiency, which depended as much on his footwork as on his fingers and keen eyesight, was proven if he could hit bullseye by just looking down at the target's reflection (Chhaya-Lakshya in Adipurana of c. 941, or Matsya-vedha in Manasollasa of c. 1129). Additional information is available in medieval sculptures which depict various archery scenes including one where a lady is taking aim from a chariot.Kamat, J.K. (1980), p. 75 Hunting was a favorite pass time of royalty in forest preserves. It served as entertainment, physical exercise and a test of endurance (mrigiyavinoda and mrigiyavilasa). The medieval sculptors spared no effort in depicting hunting scenes. The Manasollasa describes twenty one types of hunt including ambushing deer at waterholes with the hunting party dressed in green and concealed in the hollows of trees. It mentions a special breed of hunting dogs chosen from places such as the modern Jalandhar, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Vidarbha which were preferred for their stamina in chasing and cornering the prey. According to the Vikramankadevacharita queens and courtesans accompanied the king on horseback.Kamat, J.K. (1980), pp. 75‚Äì77 =Architecture= The Praneshvara temple at Talagunda, dates from the late fourth century Kadamba rule. Bhuvaraha Narasimha temple Halasi, Karnataka According to Kamath, the Kadambas are the originators of the Karnataka architecture. According to Moraes their architectural style had a few things in common with the Pallava style. Kamath points out that their Vimana style (sanctum with its superstructure) is a Kadamba invention. A good example of this construction is seen in the Shankaradeva temple at Kadarolli in the modern Belgaum district. The structures themselves were simplistic with a square garbhagriha (sanctum) with an attached larger hall called mantapa. The superstructure (Shikhara) over the sanctum is pyramidal with horizontal non-decorative stepped stages tipped at the a pinnacle with a Kalasha (or Stupika).Kamath, S.U. (1980), pp37-38Kapur (2010), p. 540 The beginnings of Kadamba architecture can be traced to the fourth century based on evidence in the Talagunda pillar inscription of c. 450. The inscription makes mention of a Mahadeva temple of the Sthanagundur Agrahara which Adiga identifies with the protected monument, the Praneshvara temple at Talagunda. The Praneshvara temple bares inscriptions of Queen Prabhavati (of King Mrigeshavarma) from the late fifth century and of their son King Ravivarma. From these inscriptions, Adiga concludes the temple existed in the late fourth century. Further, according to Adiga, the pillar inscription supports the claim that the earliest structure existed there as early as the third century and was under the patronage of the Chutu Satakarnis of Banavasi.Adiga (2006), p.287 Most of their extant constructions are seen in Halasi and surrounding areas with the oldest one ascribed to King Mrigeshavarma. Other notable temples in Halasi include the Hattikesavara temple with perforated screens by the doors, the Kallesvara temple with octagonal pillars, the Bhuvaraha Narasimha temple and the Ramesvara temple which shows a Sukhanasa projection (small tower) over the vestibule (Ardhamantapa) that connects the sanctum to the hall. All temples at Halasi have pillars with decorative capitals. The Kadamba style of tower was popular several centuries later and are seen in the Lakshmi Devi Temple at Doddagaddavalli (built by the Hoysalas in the 12th century) and the Hemakuta group of temples in Hampi built in the 14th century.Kamath, S.U. (1980), p. 38Chugh (2017), chapter 2.1, section: VishnuKapur (2010), p. 540 In addition to temples, according to the art historian K.V. Soudara Rajan, the Kadambas created three rock-cut Vedic cave temples cut out of laterite at Arvalem in Goa. Like their temples, the caves too have an Ardhamantapa (\\"half mantapa\\") with plain pillars and a sanctum which contain images of Surya (the sun god), Shiva and Skanda. In later centuries, Kadamba architecture was influenced by the ornate architectural style of their overlords, the Kalyani Chalukyas (Later Chalukyas). The best representations of this style are seen in the Mahadeva temple at Tambdi Surla in modern Goa built with an open mantapa in the late 12th-13th century by the Kadambas of Goa;Hardy (1995), p.347 the single shrined (ekakuta) Tarakeshvara temple (modeled after the Mahadeva Temple, Itagi) built prior to c.1180 with an open mantapa (and an ornate domical ceiling), a closed mantapa, a linked gateway and a Nandi mantapa (hall with the sculpture of the Nandi the bull);Hardy (1995), p.330 the Madhukeshwara temple at Banavasi which shows several Later Chalukyas style additions over a pre-existing Early Chalukya surroundings;Hardy (1995), p. 323 and the 12th century, three shrined (Trikutachala) Kadambeshvara temple with open and closed mantapa at Rattihalli.Hardy (1995), p. 342 File:Profile of vimana (shrine and tower) in the Tarakeshwara temple at Hangal.JPGTarakeshwara temple at Hangal, built by the Kadambas of Hangal File:Madhukeshwara Temple.JPGMadhukeshwara temple at Banavasi, built by the later Kadambas of Banavasi File:Mahadev Temple at Tambdi Surla.jpgThe Mahadeva temple at Tambdi Surla, Goa, built by the Kadambas of Goa =Language= According to the epigraphist D. C. Sircar, inscriptions have played a vital role in the re-construction of history of literature in India as well as the political history of the kingdoms during the early centuries of the first millennium. Some inscriptions mention names of noted contemporary and earlier poets (Aihole inscription of Ravikirti which mentions the Sanskrit poets Kalidasa and Bharavi). The development of versification and the Kavya style (\\"epic\\") of poetry appears first in inscriptions before making their appearance in literature. Further some Kavya poets were the authors of inscriptions too (Trivikramabhatta composed the Bagumra copper plates and the Sanskrit classic Nalachampu).Satyanath T.S. in Knauth & Dasgupta (2018), p.123 In the early centuries of the first millennium, inscriptions in the Deccan were predominantly in the Prakrit language. Then came a slow change with records appearing in bilingual Sanskrit-Prakrit languages around the middle of the fourth century, where the genealogy information is in Sanskrit while the functional portion was in Prakrit.Saloman (1998), pp.90-92 From around the fifth century, Prakrit fell out of use entirely and was replaced by the Dravidian languages. In the Kannada speaking regions in particular, the trend was to inscribe in Sanskrit entirely or in Sanskrit-Kannada.Saloman (1998), p. 92 The credit of the development of Kannada as a language of inscriptions between the fourth and sixth centuries goes to the Kadambas, the Gangas and the Badami Chalukyas. Among the early ones are the Halmidi stone inscription and the Tagare copper plates which are ascribed to the Kadambas. While the main content of the inscriptions were in Sanskrit, the boundary specifications of the land grant were in Kannada. In subsequent two centuries, not only do inscriptions become more numerous and longer in size, these inscriptions show a significant increase in the usage of Kannada, though the invocatory, the implicatory and the panegyric verses are in Sanskrit.Satyanath T.S. in Knauth & Dasgupta (2018), pp.125-126 Settar points out that there are inscriptions where the implicatory verses have been translated verbatim into Kannada also. In fact Kannada composed in verse meters start making their appearance in inscriptions even before being committed to literature.Satyanath T.S. in Knauth & Dasgupta (2018), p. 125 Inscriptions in Sanskrit and Kannada are the main sources of the Kadamba history. The Talagunda, Gudnapur, Birur, Shimoga, Muttur, Hebbatta, Chandravalli, Halasi and Halmidi inscription are some of the important inscriptions that throw light on this ancient ruling family of Karnataka.Kamath, S.U. (1980), pp. 30-39 Inscriptions of the Kadambas in Sanskrit and Kannada ascribed to Kadamba branches have been published by epigraphists Sircar, Desai, Gai and Rao of the Archaeological Survey of India. The Kadambas minted coins, some of which have Kannada legends which provide additional numismatic evidence of their history.Kamath, S.U. (1980), p. 12 The Kadambas (along with their contemporary Ganga dynasty of Talakad) were the first rulers to use Kannada as an additional official administrative language, as evidenced by the Halmidi inscription of c. 450. The historian Kamath claims Kannada was the common language of the region during this time. While most of their inscriptions are in Sanskrit, three important Kannada inscriptions from the rule of the early Kadambas of Banavasi have been discovered.A report on Halmidi inscription, Ramesh, K.V. (1984), p.10Kamath, S.U. (1980), p. 37 Recent reports claim that the discovery of a 5th-century Kadamba copper coin in Banavasi with Kannada script inscription Srimanaragi indicating that a mint may have existed in Banavsi that produced coins with Kannada legends at that time.. The discovery of the Talagunda Lion balustrade inscription at the Praneshvara temple during excavations in 2013, and its publication by the ASI in 2016, has shed more light on the politics of language during the early Kadamba era. The bilingual inscription of c.370-380 written in Sanskrit and Kannada is now though to be the oldest inscription in the Kannada language. In modern times Kadambotsava (\\"The festival of Kadamba\\") is a festival that is celebrated every year by the Government of Karnataka in honor of this kingdom.Kadambotsava is held at Banavasi as it is here that the Kadamba kings organized the spring festival every year. The creation of the first native Kannada kingdom is celebrated by a popular Kannada film, Mayura starring Raj Kumar. It is based on a popular novel written in 1933 with the same name by Devudu Narasimha Sastri.Das (2005), p.647 On 31 May 2005 Defence minister of India Pranab Mukherjee commissioned India's most advanced and first dedicated military naval base named INS Kadamba in Karwar.Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee opened the first phase of India's giant western naval base INS Kadamba in Karwar, Karnataka state, on 31 May. The Indian state government of Goa owned bus service is named after the Kadambas Dynasty and is known as Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTCL).The royal lion emblem of the Kadambas is used a logo on its buses. The lion emblem logo became an integral part of KTCL since its inception in 1980 when the Corporation was set up to provide better public transport service.

It features a 16-track sequencer, digital effects, and several hundred onboard sounds or patches. This music workstation got rid of some previous classical Ensoniq features, such as polyphonic after-touch (replacing it with a mono version) and full sound editability. Its concept of usage was also radically different from previous Ensoniq keyboards, such as the TS-10. The machine's operating system was created with numerous operational and MIDI software bugs. An updated OS chip that resolved these issues was created and is still available from third party vendors. Most problems were compensated for by an improved 64-note polyphony, high quality 24-bit effects and a quick (but not fully editable) sequencer. The addition of the Idea Pad, which was essentially a MIDI capture buffer, allowed the user to quickly move anything recently played on the MIDI keyboard, including pitch- bend, mod, and MIDI real-time controllers to a track in the sequencer. While the direct sample loading facilities of the previous TS/ASR models were lost, a rare add-on card, called the MR-Flash, allowed the MR/ZR keyboards to load up to 4 mebibytes of samples into permanent flash ROM, via floppy disk drive. However, no sample library import facilities were offered, so existing ASR/TS owners couldn't use their sample files on the new machine. A drum machine with pro-quality mixable preset patterns, benefited from the unusually large internal drum sounds library (approx. 700 samples) and was integrated with the sequencer, but it was impossible to create patterns inside the machine. Instead, a program that allowed a user to create drum patterns on PC was developed, thus allowing the user to create numerous rhythms that could be loaded onto disk and work within the fluid drum machine and all aspects of the keyboard. The effects section runs at full 44.1 kHz quality, unlike the TS engine at 32 kHz. The routing scheme was also simplified from previous machines and sports similarities with Roland's XP machines. All MR versions could house up to three expansion cards, each one holding up to 24 megabytes of samples and sound data. That was a first for Ensoniq products. Three are known: Perfect Piano, Urban Dance Project and World Sounds. Each cost about $250. A fourth card, the Drums Expansion, could give the rack version a feature that was a standard part of the keyboard versions. It was a 2 mebibyte add-on and contained about 700 drum sounds. A fifth card was the aforementioned flash expansion. The MR76 was the 76-note weighted keyboard version. The MR-Rack (which actually appeared before the keyboard versions) shared the same architecture and sounds, with the obvious exception of the sequencer and drum machine. Also, while the rack version could take the same wave expansion cards of the keyboard counterparts, it was not compatible with the flash ROM sample-loading add-on. You can hear some Ensoniq MR-Sounds on the Janet Jackson Song Together Again and her album The Velvet Rope from 1997.

Plot Frank Murphy (Roy Scheider) is a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) air support division pilot and troubled Vietnam War veteran with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). His newly assigned observer is novice Richard Lymangood (Daniel Stern). The two patrol Los Angeles at night and give assistance to police forces on the ground. Murphy is instructed to attend a sunrise demonstration in the Mojave Desert at \\"Pinkville\\", and is selected to pilot an advanced helicopter, informally called \\"The Special\\" and nicknamed \\"Blue Thunder\\", during an evaluation exercise. It is a military-style combat aircraft intended for police use in surveillance and against possible large- scale civic disobedience during the then-upcoming 1984 Olympic games. With powerful armament, and other accoutrements such as thermal infrared scanners, unidirectional microphones and cameras, built-in mobile telephone, computer and modem, and a U-Matic Video Cassette Recorder (VCR), Blue Thunder appears to be a formidable tool in the war on crime. Murphy notes wryly that with enough of these helicopters \\"you could run the whole damn country.\\" When the death of city councilwoman Diana McNeely turns out to be more than just a random murder, Murphy begins his own covert investigation. He discovers that a subversive action group is intending instead to use Blue Thunder in a military role to quell disorder under the project codename T.H.O.R. (\\"Tactical Helicopter Offensive Response\\"), and is secretly eliminating political opponents to advance its agenda. Murphy suspects the involvement of his old wartime nemesis, former United States Army Colonel F.E. Cochrane (Malcolm McDowell), the primary test pilot for Blue Thunder and someone who felt Murphy was \\"unsuitable\\" for the program. Murphy and Lymangood use Blue Thunder to record a meeting between Cochrane and the other government officials which would implicate them in the conspiracy, but Cochrane looks outside and sees Blue Thunder and realizes what has happened. After landing, Lymangood secures the tape and hides it, but is captured upon returning to his home, interrogated, and then killed while trying to escape. Murphy hijacks Blue Thunder and arranges to have his girlfriend Kate (Candy Clark) retrieve the tape and deliver it to the local news station, using the helicopter to thwart her pursuers. Kate arrives at the news station, but is almost captured by one of the conspirators; the reporter Kate was sent to find intercepts Kate and gets the tape back, while the conspirator is knocked unconscious by a security guard. Two Air National Guard F-16 fighters are deployed to deal with Murphy, but he manages to shoot one down and evade the other. However, in the process, one missile destroys a barbecue stand in Little Tokyo and a second impacts ARCO Plaza in Downtown Los Angeles. The operation is then suspended by the mayor. Cochrane, disobeying orders to stand down, ambushes Blue Thunder in a heavily armed Hughes 500 helicopter, and after a tense battle, Murphy is able to shoot him down after executing a 360¬∞ loop through use of Blue Thunder's turbine boost function. Murphy then destroys Blue Thunder by landing it in front of an approaching freight train. In the meantime, the tape is made public and, as a result, the conspirators are arrested.

Their original script was a more political one, attacking the concept of a police state controlling the population through high-tech surveillance and heavy armament. They sought and received extensive script help from Captain Bob Woods, then-chief of the LAPD's Air Support Division. The first draft of the screenplay for Blue Thunder was written in 1979 and featured Frank Murphy as more of a crazy main character with deeper psychological issues, who went on a rampage and destroyed much of Los Angeles before finally falling to F-16s.\\"Blue Thunder ‚Äì Original 1979 First Draft Screenplay.\\" airwing.uplink.com.

Filmed on location in Los Angeles beginning in the late months of 1981, Blue Thunder was one of Warren Oates' last films before his death on April 3, 1982, which occurred during post-production, and the film is dedicated to him. He made one movie and one TV episode before and after filming during 1981‚Äì1982 that were released after Blue Thunder. Although the film was shot in Los Angeles and real-life neighborhoods are mentioned, the LAPD did not allow any references to be made to them. Hence, the police force is known as the more-generic \\"Metropolitan Police\\" and Frank Murphy is part of the fictional \\"ASTRO Division,\\" rather than the real-life \\"Air Support Division.\\" However, Air Support assignments are often known as ASTRO, or \\"Air Support to Regular Operations.\\" The LAPD Hooper Heliport served as home base for the fictional police unit while construction of the heliport was still being completed. The drive-in theater scene where Frank's girlfriend Kate recovers the tape was filmed at the Pickwick Theatre in Burbank, California; the theater has since then been demolished and replaced by a Pavilions supermarket.Blue Thunder DVD notes, commentaries and featurettes Malcolm McDowell, who portrayed antagonist F. E. Cochrane, was intensely afraid of flying, and not even his then-wife Mary Steenburgen could persuade him to overcome his phobia. In an interview for Starlog in 1983, Badham recalled, \\"He was terrified. He used to get out and throw up after a flight.\\" McDowell's grimaces and discomfort can be seen during the climactic battle between Murphy and Cochrane in the film. Steenburgen commented to filmmakers afterward, \\"I don't know how you got him up there, I can't even get him in a 747!\\"Donner, Greg. \\"Blue Thunder: The Helicopter, Movie Information.\\" Blue Thunder.

The helicopters used for Blue Thunder were French built A√©rospatiale SA-341G Gazelles modified with bolt-on parts and Apache- style canopies.Farmer 1984, p. 98. Two modified Gazelle helicopters, a Hughes 500 helicopter, and two radio-controlled F-16 fighter models were used in the filming of the movie.Farmer 1984, p. 84. The helicopters were purchased from A√©rospatiale by Columbia Pictures for $190,000 each and flown to Cinema Air in Carlsbad, California where they were heavily modified for the film. These alterations made the helicopters so heavy that various tricks had to be employed to make it look fast and agile in the film. For instance, the 360¬∞ loop maneuver Murphy performs at the end of the film, which catches Cochrane so completely by surprise that he is easily shot down by Murphy's gunfire and killed, was carried out by a radio controlled model.

The series aired on the CBS television network and starred Bill Bixby as Dr. David Bruce Banner, Lou Ferrigno as the Hulk, and Jack Colvin as Jack McGee. In the TV series, Dr. David Banner, a widowed physician and scientist, who is presumed dead, travels across America under assumed names, and finds himself in positions where he helps others in need despite his terrible secret: in times of extreme anger or stress, he transforms into a huge, savage, incredibly strong green creature, who has been named \\"The Hulk\\". In his travels, Banner earns money by working temporary jobs while searching for a way to either control or cure his condition. All the while, he is obsessively pursued by a tabloid newspaper reporter, Jack McGee, who is convinced that the Hulk is a deadly menace whose exposure would enhance his career. The series' two-hour pilot movie, which established the Hulk's origins, aired on November 4, 1977. The series' 80 episodes were originally broadcast by CBS over five seasons from 1978 to 1982. It was developed and produced by Kenneth Johnson, who also wrote or directed some episodes. The series ends with David Banner continuing to search for a cure. In 1988, the filming rights were purchased from MCA/Universal by New World Television for a series of TV movies to conclude the series‚Äô storyline. The broadcast rights were, in turn, transferred to rival NBC. New World (which at one point owned Marvel) produced three television films: The Incredible Hulk Returns (directed by Nicholas J. Corea), The Trial of the Incredible Hulk, and The Death of the Incredible Hulk (both directed by Bill Bixby). Since its debut, The Incredible Hulk series has garnered a worldwide fan base. Premise David Bruce Banner, M.D., Ph.D., is a physician and scientist employed at California's Culver Institute, who is traumatized by the car accident that killed his beloved wife, Laura. Haunted by his inability to save her, Banner and his research partner, Dr. Elaina Marks, study people who were able to summon superhuman strength during moments of extreme stress. Obsessed with discovering why he was unable to exhibit such super-strength under similar conditions, Banner hypothesizes that high levels of gamma radiation from sunspots contributed to the subjects' increase in strength. Impatient to test his theory, Banner conducts an unsupervised experiment in the lab, bombarding himself with gamma radiation. However, the radiology equipment has recently been recalibrated, and Banner unknowingly receives a massive overdose. He initially thinks that the experiment has failed, but, when he injures himself while changing a flat tire, Banner's anger triggers his transformation into a , , green-skinned, superhumanly strong creature who is driven by rage, and has only a primitive, sub-human intelligence. The creature reverts to Banner when he calms down, and, since Banner is unable to remember what occurs while in his transformed state, he goes to Marks for help. The two of them slowly piece together what happened and investigate the nature of the metamorphosis‚Äîand the possibility for a cure. Their efforts are hindered by tabloid reporter Jack McGee, who was initially investigating Banner and Marks‚Äô superhuman strength research, but now suspects them of being connected to the reports of a green-skinned monster roaming the area. While snooping around their laboratory, McGee unknowingly triggers a fire, and Banner rushes back into the lab to save Marks, only for the creature to emerge from the fire with her in his arms, dying. Mistakenly believing that Banner was killed in the fire along with Marks, and that the creature was responsible for their deaths, McGee publishes a story naming the \\"Incredible Hulk\\" as their killer, and urges law enforcement to capture him. Believed to be dead, Banner grimly resolves to travel from place to place, assuming different identities and odd jobs to support himself and to enable his search for a cure. He also finds himself feeling obliged to help the people he meets out of whatever troubles have befallen them. Meanwhile, McGee continues to obsessively pursue the mysterious creature across the country, both to prevent further violence and to bring legitimacy to the story. Toward the end of each episode, Banner almost always flees, fearful that the Hulk's rampages will bring unwanted scrutiny from the authorities or the ever- persistent McGee. =Opening narration= The opening narration is provided by Ted Cassidy. Prior to the beginning of the series, a different version (also provided by Cassidy) was used for the second pilot movie, The Return of the Incredible Hulk (later re-titled \\"Death in the Family\\"): Episodes Cast =Main= *Bill Bixby as David Bruce Banner *Lou Ferrigno as the Hulk *Jack Colvin as Jack McGee, a reporter tracking the Hulk's trail *Ted Cassidy as the voice of the Hulk (seasons 1‚Äì2; uncredited) *Charles Napier as the voice of the Hulk (seasons 2‚Äì5 (after Cassidy's death in 1979); uncredited) =Recurring= *Walter Brooke as Mark Roberts, McGee's boss at the National Register (seasons 3‚Äì4) Production =Development= In early 1977, Frank Price, head of Universal Television (known today as NBCUniversal Television), offered producer and writer Kenneth Johnson a deal to develop a TV show based on any of several characters they had licensed from the Marvel Comics library. Johnson turned down the offer at first, but then, while reading the Victor Hugo novel Les Mis√©rables he became inspired and began working to develop the Hulk comic into a TV show. Johnson made several changes from the comic book; this was partly to translate it into a live-action show that was more believable and acceptable to a wide audience, and also because he disliked comics and thus felt it best that the show was as different from the source material as possible. In the character's origin story, rather than being exposed to gamma rays during a botched atomic testing explosion, Banner is gamma-irradiated in a more low-key laboratory mishap during a test on himself. Another change was Banner's occupation, from physicist to medical researcher/physician. Although the comic book Hulk's degree of speaking ability has varied over the years, the television Hulk did not speak at all‚Äîhe merely growled and roared. Hulk co-creator Stan Lee later recounted, \\"When we started the television show, Ken said to me, 'You know, Stan, I don't think the Hulk should talk.' The minute he said it, I knew he was right. [In the comics,] I had the Hulk talking like this: 'Hulk crush! Hulk get him!' I could get away with it in a comic, but that would have sounded so silly if he spoke that way in a television show.\\" The Hulk's strength is far more limited than in the comic book, which Johnson felt was necessary for the show to be taken seriously by viewers. The Hulk still retained a healing factor, however. For instance, in \\"The Harder They Fall\\", Banner is in a serious accident that severs his spinal cord, leaving him paraplegic, but after his next transformation into the Hulk he is able to walk within minutes while in that form, and Banner's spine is completely restored by the end of the episode. In the majority of episodes, the only science fiction element was the Hulk himself. Johnson also omitted the comic book's supporting characters, instead using original character Jack McGee. Johnson changed the name of the Hulk's comic book alter ego, Dr. Bruce Banner, to Dr. David Banner for the TV series. This change was made, according to Johnson, because he did not want the series to be perceived as a comic book series, so he wanted to change what he felt was a staple of comic books, and Stan Lee's comics in particular, that major characters frequently had alliterative names.Cronin, Brian. \\"Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #62\\". Comic Book Resources, August 3, 2006. According to both Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno, it was also changed because CBS thought the name Bruce sounded \\"too gay-ish\\", a rationale that Ferrigno thought was \\"the most absurd, ridiculous thing [he had] ever heard\\".Keck, William. \\"Lou Ferrigno looks back, and luckily, not in anger\\". USA Today, June 17, 2008, p. 2D. On the DVD commentary of the pilot, Johnson says that it was a way to honor his son David. \\"Bruce\\" ultimately became the TV Banner's middle name, as it had been in the comics. It is visible on Banner's tombstone at the end of the pilot movie, and that footage is shown at the beginning of every episode of the series. In an interview with Kenneth Johnson on the Season 2 DVD, he explains that he had also wanted the Hulk to be colored red rather than green. His reasons given for this were because red, not green, is perceived as the color of rage, and also because red is a \\"human color\\" whereas green is not. However, Stan Lee, an executive at Marvel Comics at the time, said that the Hulk's color was not something that could be changed, because of its iconic image. Stan Lee told Kenneth Plume on a June 26, 2000 interview, \\"The Hulk was done intelligently. It was done by Ken Johnson, who's a brilliant writer/producer/director, and he made it an intelligent, adult show that kids could enjoy. He took a comic book character and made him somewhat plausible. Women liked it and men liked it and teenagers liked it... It was beautifully done. He changed it quite a bit from the comic book, but every change he made, made sense.\\" =Casting= Lou Ferrigno as the Hulk, from the 1978 episode \\"Married\\" For the role of Dr. David Banner, Kenneth Johnson cast Bill Bixby‚Äîhis first choice for the role. Jack Colvin was cast as \\"Jack McGee\\", the cynical tabloid newspaper reporter‚Äîmodeled after the character of Javert in Les Mis√©rables‚Äîwho pursues the Hulk. Arnold Schwarzenegger auditioned for the role of the Hulk but was rejected due to his inadequate height, according to Johnson in his commentary on The Incredible Hulk ‚Äì Original Television Premiere DVD release. Actor Richard Kiel was hired for the role. During filming, however, Kenneth Johnson's own son pointed out that Kiel's tall-but- underdeveloped physique did not resemble the Hulk's at all. Soon, Kiel was replaced with professional bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno, although a very brief shot of Kiel (as the Hulk) remains in the pilot. According to an interview with Kiel, who saw properly out of only one eye, he reacted badly to the contact lenses used for the role, and also found the green makeup difficult to remove, so he did not mind losing the part.Richard Kiel interview. The opening narration was provided by actor Ted Cassidy, who also provided the Hulk's voice-overs (mainly growls and roars) during the first two seasons. Cassidy died during production of season two in January 1979. The Hulk's vocalizations for the remainder of the series were provided by actor Charles Napier, who also made two guest-starring appearances in the series. Guest stars and cameos During the series' five-season run, many actors familiar to viewers, or who later became famous for their subsequent works, made appearances on the series, including but not limited to: future Falcon Crest and Castle co-star Susan Sullivan in the original pilot; Brett Cullen, also of Falcon Crest; Kim Cattrall, of Sex and the City fame; Ray Walston, co-star of Bixby's first series, My Favorite Martian; Brandon Cruz, co-star of The Courtship of Eddie's Father; Lou Ferrigno, who along with starring as the Hulk, appeared in one episode (\\"King of the Beach\\") as a different character, Bixby's ex-wife Brenda Benet; and in an uncredited role, the bodybuilder and professional wrestler Ric Drasin played the half-transformed Hulk in \\"Prometheus\\" (parts 1 and 2).\\"Frequently Asked Questions. Who Played the Demi- Hulk?\\" . The Incredible Hulk Television Series site. Retrieved on December 28, 2010. Mariette Hartley won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her guest appearances as Dr. Carolyn Fields in the episodes \\"Married\\" and \\"Bride of the Incredible Hulk\\" in season two. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the writer and artist team who created the Hulk for Marvel Comics, both made cameo appearances in the series. Kirby's cameo was in the season two episode \\"No Escape\\", while Lee appeared as a juror in Trial of the Incredible Hulk (the 1989 post-series TV movie). =Make-up= Initially the Hulk's facial make-up was quite monstrous, but after both pilots, the first two weekly episodes and New York location shooting for the fourth, the design was toned down.Gerani, Gary, \\"'The Incredible Hulk'\\", Starlog Photo Guidebook: Television Episode Guides Volume 2, Starlog Press, Inc., January 1982, pp. 66‚Äì67. The makeup process used to transform Ferrigno into the Hulk took three hours. The hard contact lenses Ferrigno wore to simulate the Hulk's electric- green eyes had to be removed every 15 minutes because he found wearing them physically painful. The green fright wig he wore as the Hulk was made of dyed yak hair. =Music= Joe Harnell, one of Kenneth Johnson's favorite composers, composed the music for The Incredible Hulk. He was brought into the production due to his involvement with the series The Bionic Woman, which Johnson had also created and produced. Some of the series' music was collected into an album titled The Incredible Hulk: Original Soundtrack Recording. The show's main theme, \\"The Lonely Man\\"‚Äîa sad, solo piano tune‚Äîis always heard during the closing credits‚Äîwhich usually shows Banner hitch-hiking. Themes Often Banner's inner struggle is paralleled by the dilemmas of the people he encounters, who find in Dr. Banner a sympathetic helper. Producer Kenneth Johnson stated, \\"What we were constantly doing was looking for thematic ways to touch the various ways that the Hulk sort of manifested itself in everyone. In Dr. David Banner, it happened to be anger. In someone else, it might be obsession, or it might be fear, or it might be jealousy or alcoholism! The Hulk comes in many shapes and sizes. That's what we tried to delve into in the individual episodes\\".

After the cancellation of the television series in 1982, three television movies were produced with Bixby and Ferrigno reprising their roles. All of these aired on NBC: *The Incredible Hulk Returns (1988) ‚Äì This marked the first time that another Marvel Universe character appeared in the milieu of the TV series. David Banner meets a former student (played by Steve Levitt) who has a magical hammer that summons Thor (played by Eric Allan Kramer), a Norse god who is prevented from entering Valhalla. It was set up as a backdoor pilot for a live-action television series starring Thor. This project marked Jack Colvin's final appearance as McGee. *The Trial of the Incredible Hulk (1989) ‚Äì David Banner meets a blind lawyer named Matt Murdock and his masked alter ego, Daredevil. The Incredible Hulk and the Daredevil battle Wilson Fisk (The Kingpin of Crime). Daredevil was portrayed by Rex Smith and John Rhys-Davies portrayed Fisk.

It was rumored that in this film the Hulk would be able to talk after being revived with Banner's mind, and that it was abandoned due to Bill Bixby's death of cancer in November 1993, but Gerald Di Pego (writer/executive producer of The Trial of the Incredible Hulk, The Death of the Incredible Hulk, and Revenge of the Incredible Hulk) revealed that the film was cancelled before Bixby's health began to decline, due to disappointing ratings for Death of, and that Banner was to have been revived without the ability to change into the Hulk at all, only reverting to (still non-speaking) Hulk form in the film's final act. Home media All three of the NBC TV movies (The Incredible Hulk Returns, The Trial of the Incredible Hulk and The Death of the Incredible Hulk) have been available on DVD since 2003; the first two were released by Anchor Bay Entertainment, while The Death of the Incredible Hulk was released by 20th Century Fox Video. A double-sided DVD entitled The Incredible Hulk ‚Äì Original Television Premiere, which included the original pilot and the \\"Married\\" episodes, was released by Universal Studios DVD in 2003 to promote Ang Lee's Hulk motion picture.

Baroque pearls are pearls with an irregular non-spherical shape. Shapes can range from minor aberrations to distinctly ovoid, curved, pinch, or lumpy shapes. Most cultured freshwater pearls are baroque because freshwater pearls are mantle-tissue nucleated instead of bead nucleated. Cultured saltwater pearls can also be baroque, but tend to be more teardrop-shaped due to the use of a spherical nucleation bead. The most valuable of baroque pearls are the South Sea and Tahitian pearls. These pearls are produced by Pinctada margaritifera (black-lipped oysters) and Pinctada maxima (gold-lipped and white-lipped oysters). Although these are a variety of cultured saltwater pearls, the amount of time that the pearls are cultured dramatically increases the depth of the nacre, and the likelihood of producing a baroque pearl. Most Tahitian pearl farm harvests, for example, produce more than 40 percent baroque and semi-baroque pearls. Western Australia is currently the world's largest cultivator of Pinctada maxima gold-lipped oysters. Tahiti is the number one cultivator of Pinctada maxima black-lipped oysters.

Career =College and Amateur= After a successful high school career at North Stafford High School in Stafford, Virginia, Carrieri played college soccer at the University of North Carolina, where he was hugely successful. In his rookie year, he scored 13 goals and 3 assists, and was named the ACC Rookie of the Year. He did just as well his second year, finishing with 12 goals and 5 assists, and was named a third team NCAA All-American. In his junior season, he led the nation by scoring 25 goals, and added an astonishing 14 assists, and was named an NCAA first-team All-American. He also played club soccer for the Prince William Cardinals. =Professional= In 2000, Carrieri played two games, scoring three goals, with the New Brunswick Brigade in the Premier Development League. Following his junior season, Carrieri signed a Project-40 contract with MLS. He was drafted first overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft by the San Jose Earthquakes, and immediately vowed to lead the team to a championship. Although the Earthquakes won the MLS Cup that year, Carrieri was not there to see it - shortly into the season he was traded to the Colorado Rapids for Junior Agogo. Carrieri had a relatively impressive rookie campaign with the Rapids, registering 5 goals and 4 assists in only 14 games with the team. In his second year with the team, Carrieri established his reputation as a quality American forward in scoring 11 goals and 5 assists for the Rapids, including a remarkable 2nd half hat trick on July 4 (the second in club history) in front of 61,213 fans at Invesco Field at Mile High. In his third year, Carrieri's production slowed, partially because of a contested (and temporary) move to right midfield, and he finished the year with 3 goals and 8 assists. Following the season, Carrieri was not re-signed by the Rapids, apparently partially because of conflicts with the coach Tim Hankinson, and partially because of salary cap concerns. Carrieri signed before the 2004 season with the Rochester Raging Rhinos of the A-League. He had a solid season with the team, finishing the year with 8 goals and 8 assists in 27 games. After the end of the season, he played one game with the Chicago Fire, after being called up as an injury replacement. Carrieri also briefly played indoor for the Chicago Storm of the MISL. In 2005, with coach Tim Hankinson no longer at the helm, the Rapids brought back Carrieri for tryouts, but did not offer him a contract after pre- season. He then signed with Richmond Kickers of the then A-League. In 2006, Richmond went down to USL-2. Still under contract with the Kickers, Carrieri stayed with the newly demoted club and helped lead them to the 2006 USL Second Division Championship, where he scored the championship winning goal for the Kickers. In 2007, he became one of the first players to sign with the expansion USL First Division club Carolina RailHawks. He played in twenty- eight games, most as a starter, before announcing his retirement from professional soccer on March 18, 2008.Carrieri calls it quits After spending 2008 coaching with the Capital Area Soccer League in Raleigh, North Carolina, Carrieri was coaxed out of retirement in 2009 by the Richmond Kickers, and he subsequently played 5 games and scored 1 goal for the team on the way to winning the 2009 USL2 championship.Kickers claim USL-2 Championship On January 14, 2010 Richmond announced the re-signing of Carrieri for the 2010 season.

Cultured pearls can be farmed using two very different groups of bivalve mollusk: the freshwater river mussel, and the saltwater pearl oysters. Development of a pearl Cross-section of a cultured and a natural pearl A pearl is formed when the mantle tissue is injured by a parasite, an attack of a fish or another event that damages the external fragile rim of the shell of a mollusk shell bivalve or gastropod. In response, the mantle tissue of the mollusk secretes nacre into the pearl sac, a cyst that forms during the healing process. Chemically speaking, this is calcium carbonate and a fibrous protein called conchiolin. As the nacre builds up in layers of minute aragonite tablets, it fills the growing pearl sac and eventually forms a pearl. Natural pearls are formed by nature, more or less by chance. On the other hand, cultured pearls are human creations formed by inserting a tissue graft from a donor mollusk, upon which a pearl sac forms, and the inner side precipitates calcium carbonate, in the form of nacre or \\"mother-of-pearl\\". The most popular and effective method for creating cultured pearls are made from the shells of freshwater river mussels harvested in the midwestern states of the U.S., from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Shells with the common names, \\"Washboard\\" \\"Maple Leaf\\" \\"Ebony\\" \\"Pimpleback\\" and \\"Three Ridge\\" are popular for use in pearl culture due to their compatibility with the host animal, and the nacre they are to be covered by. These high-quality and sought-after shells are first sliced into strips and then into cubes. The edges and corners are ground down until they are a roughly spherical and then milled to become perfectly round, and brought to a highly polished finish. After the nucleus is ready, the next step is obtaining the mantle tissue. The mantle tissue is harvested from one oyster and cut into small pieces. After obtaining the mantle tissue from the first oyster it is time to operate on the second animal. The oyster is placed in warm water to relax the animal. Then it is gently pried open and mounted in a stand to be operated on. A small incision is made and the nucleus is inserted along with a small piece of mantle gland. The oyster is then placed back in the water and allowed over several years to coat the nucleus with nacre. The nucleus is coated in many layers of this nacre, so that when pearls are cut in half, visible layers can be seen. Process Cultured dark Tahiti pearls, one of the pearls is cut to expose the manmade nucleus bead The cultured pearls on the market today can be divided into two categories. The first category covers the beaded cultured pearls, including Akoya, South Sea, Tahiti and the large, modern freshwater pearl, the Edison pearl. These pearls are gonad-grown, and usually one pearl is grown at a time. This limits the number of pearls at a harvest period. The pearls are usually harvested after one year for Akoya, 2‚Äì4 years for Tahitian and South Sea, and 2‚Äì7 years for Edison. This perliculture process was first developed by the British biologist William Saville-Kent who passed the information along to Tatsuhei Mise and Tokichi Nishikawa from Japan. The second category includes the non-beaded freshwater cultured pearls, like the Biwa or Chinese pearls. As they grow in the mantle, where on each wing up to 25 grafts can be implanted, these pearls are much more frequent and saturate the market completely. An impressive improvement in quality has taken place in the last ten years when the former rice grain-shaped pebbles are compared with the near round pearls of today. In the last two years large near perfect round bead nucleated pearls up to 15mm in diameter have been produced with metallic luster. The nucleus bead in a beaded cultured pearl is generally a polished sphere made from freshwater mussel shell. Along with a small piece of mantle tissue from another mollusk (donor shell) to serve as a catalyst for the pearl sac, it is surgically implanted into the gonad (reproductive organ) of a saltwater mollusk. In freshwater perliculture, only the piece of tissue is used in most cases, and is inserted into the fleshy mantle of the host bivalve. South Sea and Tahitian pearl oysters, also known as Pinctada maxima and Pinctada margaritifera, which survive the subsequent surgery to remove the finished pearl, are often implanted with a new, larger beads as part of the same procedure and then returned to the water for another 2‚Äì3 years of growth. An experimental process using an RFID nucleus allows the provenance of cultured pearls to be tracked. White pearl necklace History Mikimoto K≈çkichi was able to use Nishikawa's technology. After the patent was granted in 1916, the technology was immediately commercially applied to akoya pearl oysters in Japan in 1916. Mise's brother was the first to produce a commercial crop of pearls in the akoya oyster. Mitsubishi's Baron Iwasaki immediately applied the technology to the South Sea pearl oyster in 1917 in the Philippines, and later in Buton and Palau. Mitsubishi was the first to produce a cultured South Sea pearl ‚Äì although it was not until 1928 that the first small commercial crop of pearls was successfully produced. The original Japanese cultured pearls, known as akoya pearls, are produced by a species of small pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata, which is no bigger than 6 to 8 cm in size, hence akoya pearls larger than 10 mm in diameter are extremely rare and highly priced. Today, a hybrid mollusk is used in both Japan and China in the production of akoya pearls. Furthermore, other Pinctada and Pteria species are also used for producing cultured pearls today. Modern industry X-ray of a cultured pearl set in jewelry The development of cultured pearls took much of the chance, risk, and guesswork out of the pearl industry, allowing it to become stable and predictable, and fostering its rapid growth over the past 100 years. Today, more than 99% of all pearls sold worldwide are cultured pearls. Colored Pearls, which occur due to local chemicals inside the shell, much in the way of rubies or sapphires, can be made by inserting natural dyes into the mussel shell, e.g., cobalt chloride to create a pinkish color. Cultured pearls can often be distinguished from natural pearls through the use of x-rays, which reveals the inner nucleus of the pearl.

They operate by causing a build-up of fluids in the lungs, which then leads to suffocation. Exposure to the eyes and skin tends to be corrosive, causing blurred vision and severe deep burns. Inhalation of these agents cause burning of the throat, coughing, vomiting, headache, pain in chest, tightness in chest, and respiratory and circulatory failure. Examples of pulmonary agents include: *Chlorine gas *Chloropicrin (PS) *Diphosgene (DP) *Phosgene (CG) *Disulfur decafluoride *Perfluoroisobutene *Acrolein *Diphenylcyanoarsine Phosgene is the most dangerous commonly used pulmonary agent (although disulfur decafluoride and perfluoroisobutene are both even more dangerous, with respectively 4 and 10 times the lethality of phosgene, neither is widely used). It is a colorless gas under ordinary conditions. It has a vapor density 3.4 times greater than that of air, allowing it to remain low in the air for long periods of times. Phosgene leads to massive pulmonary edema, which reaches maximum symptoms in 12 hours after exposure, followed by death within 24 to 48 hours. Chlorine is an element used in industry. It is one of the most commonly manufactured chemicals in the United States. It is used to make pesticides, rubber, and solvents. It is also used in drinking water and swimming pools to kill bacteria. The extent of poisoning chlorine causes depends on the amount of chlorine to which a person is exposed.  History  The first major use of these agents came on April 22, 1915, at the Second Battle of Ypres in Belgium. The Germans opened up 168 tons of chlorine gas on the French, Canadian and British troops which created a wind-borne cloud of chemical gas that opened up a breach in the lines. However, the Germans were not prepared to exploit the opening. In 1917 the Germans also introduced the agent phosgene. By then both sides had mastered the techniques of new choking agents such as diphosgene, chloropicrin, and perfluoroisobutene which allowed numerous attacks to be made. By the end of World War I, phosgene was responsible for roughly 80% of all deaths related to chemical attacks.  References  * U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense. (Sep. 1995).

It is widespread, especially in the tropics, where it can be found on the dead branches of broadleaf trees. This fungus is commercially cultivated and is one of the most popular fungi in the cuisine and medicine of China. Tremella fuciformis is commonly known as snow fungus, snow ear, silver ear fungus, and white jelly mushroom. Tremella fuciformis is a parasitic yeast, and grows as a slimy, mucous-like film until it encounters its preferred hosts, various species of Annulohypoxylon (or possibly Hypoxylon) fungi, whereupon it then invades, triggering the aggressive mycelial growth required to form the fruiting bodies. Taxonomy and naming Eunibeoseot (, \\"silver ear mushroom\\") Tremella fuciformis was first described in 1856 by English mycologist Miles Joseph Berkeley, based on collections made in Brazil by the botanist and explorer Richard Spruce. In 1939, Japanese mycologist Yosio Kobayasi described Nakaiomyces nipponicus, a similar-looking fungus that differed by having scattered, dark spines on its surface. Later research, however, showed that the fruit bodies were those of Tremella fuciformis parasitized by an ascomycete, Ceratocystis epigloeum, that formed the dark spines. Nakaiomyces nipponicus is therefore a synonym of T. fuciformis. In Mandarin Chinese, it is called Èì∂ËÄ≥ (pinyin: y√≠n ƒõr; literally \\"silver ear\\"), Èõ™ËÄ≥ (pinyin: xuƒõ ƒõr; literally \\"snow ear\\"); or ÁôΩÊú®ËÄ≥ (pinyin: b√°i m√π ƒõr, literally \\"white wood ear\\"), and in Japanese it is called shiro kikurage („Ç∑„É≠„Ç≠„ÇØ„É©„Ç≤, lit. \\"white tree jellyfish\\"). In Vietnam, it is called n·∫•m tuy·∫øt or ng√¢n nhƒ©. In his book, Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms, Paul Stamets lists the following common names for Tremella fuciformis (which he calls \\"white jelly mushroom\\"): yin er, white jelly fungus, white jelly leaf (\\"shirokikurage\\"), silver ear mushroom, snow mushroom, chrysanthemum mushroom. Description Fruit bodies are gelatinous, watery white, up to across (larger in cultivated specimens), and composed of thin but erect, seaweed- like, branching fronds, often crisped at the edges. Microscopically, the hyphae are clamped and occur in a dense gelatinous matrix. Haustorial cells arise on the hyphae, producing filaments that attach to and penetrate the hyphae of the host. The basidia are tremelloid (ellipsoid, with oblique to vertical septa), 10‚Äì13 Œºm √ó 6.5‚Äì10 Œºm, sometimes stalked. The basidiospores are ellipsoid, smooth, 5‚Äì8 Œºm √ó 4‚Äì6 Œºm, and germinate by hyphal tube or by yeast cells. Habitat and distribution Tremella fuciformis is known to be a parasite of Hypoxylon species. Many of these species were reassigned to a new genus, Annulohypoxylon, in 2005 including its preferred host, Annulohypoxylon archeri, the species routinely used in commercial cultivation. Following its host, fruit bodies are typically found on dead, attached or recently fallen branches of broadleaf trees. The species is mainly tropical and subtropical, but extends into temperate areas in Asia and North America. It is known throughout South and Central America, the Caribbean, parts of North America, sub-Saharan Africa, southern and eastern Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands. Economic usage bird's nest Tremella fuciformis has been cultivated in China since at least the nineteenth century. Initially, suitable wooden poles were prepared and then treated in various ways in the hope that they would be colonized by the fungus. This haphazard method of cultivation was improved when poles were inoculated with spores or mycelium. Modern production only began, however, with the realization that both the Tremella and its host species needed to be inoculated into the substrate to ensure success. The \\"dual culture\\" method, now used commercially, employs a sawdust mix inoculated with both fungal species and kept under optimal conditions. The most popular species to pair with T. fuciformis is its preferred host, Annulohypoxylon archeri. Estimated production in China in 1997 was 130,000 tonnes. Tremella fuciformis is also cultivated in other East Asian countries, with some limited cultivation elsewhere. In Chinese cuisine, Tremella fuciformis is traditionally used in sweet dishes. While tasteless, it is valued for its gelatinous texture as well as its supposed medicinal benefits. Most commonly, it is used to make a dessert soup called luk mei (ÂÖ≠Âë≥) in Cantonese, often in combination with jujubes, dried longans, and other ingredients. It is also used as a component of a drink and as an ice cream. Since cultivation has made it less expensive, it is now additionally used in some savoury dishes. In Vietnamese cuisine, it's often used in Ch√® (Vietnamese pronunciation: [c…õÃÇ]), a Vietnamese term that refers to any traditional Vietnamese sweet beverage, dessert soup or pudding. Cosmetic use Tremella fuciformis extract is used in women's beauty products from China, Korea, and Japan.

During the 19th and early 20th century it was a common name for the burial grounds of gunfighters, or those who \\"died with their boots on\\" (i.e., violently).  Origin of term  Although many towns use the name \\"Boot Hill\\", the first graveyard named \\"Boot Hill\\" was at Hays, Kansas, 5 years before the founding of Dodge City, Kansas. The term alludes to the fact that many of its occupants were cowboys who \\"died with their boots on,\\" the implication here being they died violently, as in gunfights or by hanging, and not of natural causes. The term became commonplace throughout the Old West, with some Boot Hills becoming famous, such as Dodge City, Kansas, Tombstone, Arizona, and Deadwood, South Dakota. Boothill Graveyard The most notable use of the name \\"Boot Hill\\" is at the Boothill Graveyard in Tombstone, Arizona. Formerly called the \\"Tombstone Cemetery\\", the plot features the graves of Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury and Tom McLaury; the three men who were killed during the famed Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.Martin, Douglas D. (1997). Tombstone's Epitaph. University of Oklahoma Press. . Located on the northwest corner of the town, the graveyard is believed to hold over 300 persons, 205 of which are recorded. This was due to some people (especially Chinese and Jewish immigrants) being buried without record. There is a separate Jewish cemetery nearby with some markers restored, and there are also marked graves of Chinese. However, most of the loss was due to neglect of grave markers and theft of these wooden relics as souvenirs.Interment Cemetery Records. Retrieved 2010-03-11. For example, when former Tombstone Mayor John Clum visited Tombstone for the first Helldorado celebration in 1929, he was unable to locate the grave of his wife Mary, who had been buried in Boothill. The Tombstone \\"boothill\\" cemetery was closed in late 1886, as the new \\"City Cemetery\\" on Allen Street opened. Thereafter, Boothill was referred to as the \\"old city cemetery\\" and neglected. It was used after that only to bury a few later outlaws (some legally hanged and one shot in a robbery), as well as a few colorful Western characters and one man (Emmett Crook Nunnally) who had spent many volunteer hours restoring it.Ben T. Traywick, Tombstone's Boothill, Red Marie's Bookstore, Tombstone AZ, 1971. Currently, the Boothill Graveyard is open to the public for a $3 fee, and is a popular stop for tourists visiting Tombstone. Boot Hill Museum The Boot Hill Museum is located on the original location of the Boot Hill Cemetery in Dodge City, Kansas. In popular culture Boot Hill is the name of the cemetery in Dodge City in the Gunsmoke radio series. In many episodes, the marshal (Matt Dillon) would allude to \\"putting you in Boot Hill\\", or \\"another man headed to Boot Hill\\". In the first season of the Gunsmoke television series, the introduction to each episode showed Matt Dillon walking around Boot Hill reflecting on the deaths of men buried there. Boot Hill cemetery is a main plot point in the Twilight Zone episode Mr. Garrity and the Graves. Boothill Graveyard is referenced in many films such as Tombstone (1993), Wyatt Earp (1994), and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), during which it was repeatedly sung over the recurring title theme song by Frankie Laine. In the later half of the movie Laine changes the theme to: Boot Hill is the name of a role playing game first published in 1975 by TSR, Inc., the original publisher of Dungeons & Dragons. It was the third game released by TSR and notable as one of the first games to use ten-sided dice. Boot Hill also appears in the first person shooter video game Borderlands 2, located in 'The Dust', and playing home to a 'truxican standoff'. Carl Perkins wrote in 1959 a song \\"The Ballad of Boot Hill\\". Johnny Cash recorded it for Columbia Records and it was released in the same year. A Spaghetti Western named Boot Hill was released in 1969 and it featured Terence Hill and Bud Spencer. The first of three parts that compose the Neil Young song \\"Country Girl\\", that appears in his 1970 album with Crosby, Stills & Nash, \\"D√©j√† Vu\\", is called \\"Whiskey Boot Hill\\". The Outlaws' song \\"Hurry Sundown\\" also references \\"lying\\" an unnamed character in \\"Boot Hill\\". Several themes from Bob Dylan‚Äôs soundtrack album \\"Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid\\" (1973) contain the verse \\"Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send ya\\". The song \\"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\\" from Billy Joel's 1973 Album Piano Man contains the lyrics \\"And he never had a sweetheart, but he finally found a home, underneath the boothill grave that bears his name\\". In cricket, the term 'Boot Hill' is used to refer to the fielding position of short-leg because of its proximity to the batsman and high likelihood of being hit by the ball, making the position particularly dangerous. Players fielding in this position typically wear a helmet and other protection. In the comic book series Preacher, the Saint of Killers rests at a tomb on Boot Hill when not actively pursuing his goals.

History Postmodern theology emerged in the 1980s and 1990s when a handful of philosophers who took philosopher Martin Heidegger as a common point of departure began publishing influential books on theology. Some of the more notable works of the era include Jean-Luc Marion's 1982 book God Without Being, Mark C. Taylor's 1984 book Erring, Charles Winquist's 1994 book Desiring Theology, John D. Caputo's 1997 book The Prayers and Tears of Jacques Derrida, and Carl Raschke's 2000 book The End of Theology. There are at least two branches of postmodern theology, each of which has evolved around the ideas of particular post-Heideggerian continental philosophers. Those branches are radical orthodoxy and weak theology. =Radical orthodoxy= Radical orthodoxy is a branch of postmodern theology that has been influenced by the phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion, Paul Ric≈ìur, and Michel Henry, among others. Although radical orthodoxy is informally organized, its proponents often agree on a handful of propositions. First, there is no sharp distinction between reason on the one hand and faith or revelation on the other. In addition, the world is best understood through interactions with God, even though a full understanding of God is never possible. Those interactions include culture, language, history, technology, and theology. Further, God directs people toward truth, which is never fully available to them. In fact, a full appreciation of the physical world is only possible through a belief in transcendence. Finally, salvation is found through interactions with God and others.http://www.unifr.ch/theo/assets/files/SA2015/Theses_EN.pdf Prominent advocates of radical orthodoxy include John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and Graham Ward. =Weak theology= Weak theology is a branch of postmodern theology that has been influenced by the deconstructive thought of Jacques Derrida, including Derrida's description of a moral experience he calls \\"the weak force.\\"; Weak theology rejects the idea that God is an overwhelming physical or metaphysical force. Instead, God is an unconditional claim without any force whatsoever. As a claim without force, the God of weak theology does not intervene in nature. As a result, weak theology emphasizes the responsibility of humans to act in this world here and now. John D. Caputo is a prominent advocate of the movement. Leading thinkers *John D.

Born in Nelson, Trent obtained a short-term commission in the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1938 after receiving flight training in New Zealand. After travelling to England, he was posted to No. 15 Squadron RAF and was sent to France shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, flying Fairey Battles on photo-reconnaissance missions into Germany. After his squadron returned to England and converted to Bristol Blenheims, he flew several bombing missions during the Battle of France for which he was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). Afterwards he spent several months on instructing duties before being posted to No. 487 (NZ) Squadron in August 1942, which operated Lockheed Venturas. He was shot down over Amsterdam while on a bombing mission, codenamed Operation Ramrod 16, on 3 May 1943, becoming a prisoner of war. After the war, he was awarded the VC for his actions during Ramrod 16. He continued to serve with the RAF and was commander of No. 214 Squadron during the Suez Crisis. He retired in June 1965 and lived in Australia, and then New Zealand, in his later years. He died in 1986, aged 71. Early life Leonard Henry Trent was born in Nelson, New Zealand, on 14 April 1915, the son of Leonard Trent, a dentist, and his wife Irene . In April 1919 the family relocated to Takaka, along the shore of Golden Bay. Three years later, his father paid for Trent to take a short flight in a Gipsy Moth piloted by Malcolm C. McGregor, a fighter ace of the First World War, and subsequently Trent became interested in flying. He was educated at Nelson College, boarding at the school from 1928. Not particularly academically inclined he became increasingly interested in golf and in his final year at school, in 1934, won the Nelson Golf Club Senior Championship. Trent had intended to go to university to study dentistry, but the family could not afford to pay for his studies and he instead took up a position as a clerk in the administrative office of an abattoir in Hastings. He gave up the work after a year and returned to Nelson to assist his father in his dental practice. After a time he moved to Wellington taking up office work again. He was soon earning enough money that he could afford to go to night school and study aero engineering and maintenance. Early service career In early 1937, in response to an advertisement in a newspaper, Trent applied for a short-term commission in the Royal Air Force (RAF). He passed a selection interview and subsequent medical test and in August was accepted for flight training. Induction training was with the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) and was held at Taieri, near Dunedin, where he flew Gipsy Moths and Miles Magisters. Trent then undertook flight training at the RNZAF's Wigram Air Base in Christchurch, flying Avro 626 and Vickers Vildebeest aircraft. He gained his wings on 12 May 1938 and a month later he sailed for Britain to join the RAF. He was granted a short-service commission of five years in the rank of pilot officer on 23 August 1938. Posted to No. 15 Squadron RAF, which operated Fairey Battles out of Abingdon in Berkshire, Trent spent the next few months learning bombing and reconnaissance flying techniques. In February 1939, he spent three months at Hamble, near Southampton, attending a navigation course. Here he met Ursula Woolhouse, while playing golf at the local club in his downtime. Second World War In early September 1939, following the outbreak of the Second World War, No. 15 Squadron flew to France as part of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force. Stationed at Vraux, the squadron was to fly high- level photo-reconnaissance missions over enemy territory, collecting information on German airfields, factories and major infrastructure. Trent flew his first mission into Germany on 24 September 1939, No. 15 Squadron's first operational sortie of the war. This period of the war was known as the Phoney War, and much the squadron's flying revolved around training and practice bombing missions. The squadron was sent back to England in early December to convert to the Bristol Blenheim IV, a light bomber, operating from Wyton. Initial conversion work was on the Bristol Blenheim I and during this time Trent had to make an emergency landing, having become lost in overcast conditions while on a flight to Scotland. In March 1940, he was promoted to flying officer. The squadron returned to operations when the Germans invaded France and the Low Countries on 10 May 1940. That day he flew one of three aircraft that bombed German forces at an aerodrome near Rotterdam. Further missions followed, including a bombing raid on bridges over the Albert Canal that saw six of the twelve participating aircraft destroyed. On another mission, his aircraft suffered damage from flak and an attacking Messerschmitt Me 109 fighter and he put down at an airfield on the way back to his base for repairs. However, advancing Germans threatened the airfield and as night fell, he and his crew had to fly to England as they could not navigate back to their base in France. On 23 May, casualties in the squadron saw Trent take command of one of its flights in conjunction with a promotion to acting flight lieutenant. He led several bombing sorties while Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk, was in effect and by mid-June had flown 14 sorties. Exhausted, he was sent on leave. On his return to duty, Trent was posted to No. 17 Operational Training Unit, stationed at Upwood, as an instructor. He taught trainees formation flying and made navigational flights in Avro Ansons. He also had the opportunity to fly other aircraft; these included the Wellington bomber. In the meantime, his relationship with Ursula Woolhouse continued to grow and on 7 August 1940 the couple were married at Holborn, London. The previous month he had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his outstanding performance during the Battle of France. In March 1941, his flight lieutenant rank was made substantive and six months later Trent received a new posting at the Operational Training Squadron at Warboys. He helped assess the Douglas Boston bomber for service in the RAF; on his first flight in the aircraft, it suffered an engine fire forcing an immediate return to his base. Trent returned to operational duty in March 1942 and, promoted to temporary squadron leader on 1 June, was assigned to Headquarters, No. 2 Group RAF. He found the duty dull and began to seek a position at No. 88 Squadron where a friend of his was the squadron leader. =Service with No. 487 Squadron= Squadron Leader Trent (left) with Wing Commander G. J. \\"Chopper\\" Grindell (centre) and Squadron Leader T. Turnbull (right) in 1943 In August 1942, the RAF established a new bomber squadron, designated No. 487 (NZ) Squadron, based at Feltwell in Norfolk. An Article XV squadron, many of its flying personnel were New Zealanders, although other nationalities also served with the squadron. Trent, still hoping for a posting to No. 88 Squadron, was instead sent to No. 487 Squadron as one of its flight commanders. The squadron was to operate Lockheed Venturas; these were unpopular aircraft, being relatively slow and demanding to fly, with an inadequate defensive armament. Although the senior officers in the squadron were experienced flying personnel, many crew members were novices and needed extensive practice in formation flying before reaching an acceptable standard for operational duties. The squadron flew its first mission in December, a raid on a factory at Eindhoven in the Netherlands. Over the next several months, the squadron flew raids to targets in France and the Low Countries. On 3 May 1943 the squadron flew a bombing mission, codenamed Operation Ramrod 16, on a power station in Amsterdam. The mission was intended to be as a diversion for another raid being carried out almost simultaneously on a power station at Ijmuiden. \\"Ramrod\\" was a term designating a daylight bombing mission, with a fighter escort, that targeted a specific objective. The twelve participating Venturas, led by Trent, were to cross the Dutch coast at sea level, escorted by six squadrons of Supermarine Spitfires. Two more squadrons of Spitfires were to provide top cover for the Venturas over the target, with all of the aircraft keeping to sea level as they approached the Dutch coast so as to avoid showing up on German radar, before climbing to reach bombing height. However, the Spitfires flying top cover mistimed their departure from England, arriving early and failing to keep low enough when reaching the Dutch coast. This alerted the German defences. Non-commissioned officers of Trent's No. 487 Squadron, with a Ventura at RAF Methwold, early 1943 One Ventura had returned to England with a malfunction and as the eleven remaining aircraft of No. 487 Squadron approached Amsterdam, they and their escorts were set upon by Me 109s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, 70 aircraft in all. The top cover, arriving well before the Venturas, had already been recalled having run low on fuel. The Fw 190s dealt with the escorting Spitfires while the Me 109s targeted the bombers. Under constant attack by the German fighters, No. 487 Squadron continued on to its target, with only five aircraft making it to Amsterdam to commence their bombing run. Only Trent successfully completed his run, and in doing so shot down one Me 109 with the forward machine guns of his Ventura. Immediately afterwards, his own aircraft was hit and put into a spin. As the Ventura broke up, Trent and his navigator were thrown clear at and became prisoners of war (POW). The remaining crew members, trapped in the aircraft, were unable to exit and were killed when it crashed. =Stalag Luft III= Trent was sent to Stalag Luft III, a POW camp well to the southeast of Berlin, in what is now ≈ªaga≈Ñ, in Poland. He soon became involved in the various escape attempts mounted by the POWs, helping conceal the sand extracted from tunnels that were under construction. He was a participant in the \\"Great Escape\\" of 24 March 1944. On exiting the tunnel, he had planned with another POW, Mike Shand, to make their way to Switzerland via Czechoslovakia and Austria. He was the 79th POW to pass through the escape tunnel, just behind Shand. However, as he was exiting the tunnel, a German guard thwarted his escape and Trent was recaptured almost immediately and placed in solitary confinement. The majority of the successful escapees were eventually recaptured, the Germans executing 50 of them. By January 1945, the Soviet forces were advancing into Germany and the POWs at Stalag Luft III were force marched away to the west to a camp near Bremen. They were moved again in April but were liberated by the British on 2 May 1945. Trent returned to England on 7 May and went on leave for two months before reporting back for duty with the RAF. Preferring active flying to instructional duties, he requested a post at Transport Command. He qualified as a Douglas Dakota pilot and then spent a few months at Syerston, a paratrooper training school. In late 1945, Trent transferred back to RNZAF service. He wanted to pursue a career in the military and felt that the RNZAF offered better remuneration and promotion opportunities than the RAF. Victoria Cross On his return to duty, Trent had provided a written debrief on the Ramrod 16 raid. After considering Trent's statements on the Ramrod 16 raid and other evidence collected by the Air Ministry, the commander of No. 2 Group, Air Vice-Marshal Basil Embry, recommended him for the Victoria Cross (VC). Instituted in 1856, the VC was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on military personnel of the British Commonwealth. Having been informally advised that he was to be a recipient of the VC earlier that day, Trent's award was publicly announced on 1 March 1946. The citation for Trent's VC was published in the London Gazette and read: Trent, with his wife present, received the VC from King George VI in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 26 March 1946. Post-war service career In late 1946, Trent and his family travelled by sea to Auckland in New Zealand for a period of extended leave before commencing service with the RNZAF. As a VC recipient, he attended a number of civic functions around the country and had his portrait painted by Archibald Nicoll. Once his leave had finished, his initial work for the RNZAF was as part of a committee to select fliers for service with the RAF, which was seeking to augment its ranks with experienced personnel. The RAF was also increasing rates of remuneration for its personnel and when it offered Trent a permanent commission, he accepted. He returned to England with his family, which now included a son, in late 1947 and resumed his career in the RAF with the substantive rank of flight lieutenant. Trent was posted to Bircham Newton, a Transport Command station, as an instructor to help prepare students to fly Dakotas. In September 1948, having been promoted to the substantive rank of squadron leader earlier in the year, he was sent to Dishforth which trained pilots to fly the Avro York transport. He flew several operations during the Berlin airlift but soon began to suffer from ankylosing spondylitis which required specialist treatment for a few months before he could return to duty. Now posted to Flying Training Command, in August 1950 Trent undertook refresher and leadership courses before going on to Central Flying School early the following year. Trent returned to Feltwell, where he had been based while at No. 487 Squadron, in March 1951. He was chief instructor at No. 3 Flying Training School, teaching students to fly the Harvard trainer. In October 1952, he was appointed squadron commander of No. 4 Squadron, which was based at Little Rissington and operated de Havilland Vampires. The following year, Trent was promoted to wing commander and posted to Oakington where he instructed on Gloster Meteors. While there, he had to bail out of a Meteor which had gone into an unrecoverable spin. Not long afterwards, in early 1954, with the flight school having re-equipped with Vampires, Trent had to again bail out when he lost control of his aircraft. A Vickers Valiant of No. 214 Squadron In early 1956, after attending a six-month course at No. 6 Flying College Course at Manby, Trent was appointed commander of No. 214 Squadron, which was the first unit to be equipped with the new Vickers Valiant. Later that year, in October, his squadron was dispatched to Malta due to the outbreak of the Suez Crisis and flew a number of missions into Egypt. The squadron returned to England at the end of year when tensions eased. In March 1958, he flew a Valiant to New Zealand as part of the celebrations for the twenty-first anniversary of the founding of the RNZAF. The next month, he took up a post as Wing Commander Training at No. 3 Group Headquarters at Mildenhall and was promoted to the rank of group captain on 1 July 1959. Trent was appointed station commander at RAF Wittering in April 1960. He still occasionally flew Valiants, including taking one on a goodwill tour to the United States. He then served as an air attach√©, representing Bomber Command at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. from mid-1962, and on 12 June the same year, he was appointed an air aide-de-camp to the Queen. As the Queen never visited Washington, D.C. during his tenure there, he was never called upon to serve in this role. After three years, his service in the United States ended and he retired from the RAF on 23 June 1965. Later life Following his retirement in 1965, Trent moved his family to Western Australia. With his wife, he later returned to New Zealand to live at Matheson Bay, north of Auckland. He died on 19 May 1986 at North Shore Hospital, survived by his wife and two children. He was cremated and his ashes were taken to Western Australia, where they were interred at Fremantle Cemetery alongside those of his daughter, Judith, who had predeceased him. Trent's medals, including the VC, are held by the Air Force Museum of New Zealand at Wigram in Christchurch. There is a memorial to Trent at the airport in Nelson, his home town, and there is also a plaque honouring him in Queens Gardens in Dunedin.

Typically, jasmine tea has green tea as the tea base; however, white tea and black tea are also used. The resulting flavour of jasmine tea is subtly sweet and highly fragrant. It is the most famous scented tea in China. The jasmine plant is believed to have been introduced into China from eastern South Asia via India during the Han Dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD), and was being used to scent tea around the fifth century. However, jasmine tea did not become widespread until the Qing Dynasty (1644 to 1912 AD), when tea started to be exported in large quantities to the West. Nowadays, it's still a common drink served in tea shops around the world. The jasmine plant is grown at high elevations in the mountains. Jasmine tea produced in the Chinese province of Fujian has the best reputation.Gong, Wen. Lifestyle in China. ‰∫îÊ¥≤‰º†Êí≠Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, 2007. Retrieved October 23, 2010, from Jasmine tea is also produced in the provinces of Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Zhejiang. Japan is also known for the production of jasmine tea, especially in Okinawa Prefecture, where it is called Sanpin-cha („Åï„Çì„Å¥„ÇìËå∂). Modern biological studies have shown that drinking jasmine tea can have health and immunity benefits. Jasmine tea contains several different kinds of antioxidants that provide protection to the membranes of red blood cells; this added protection helps fend off free radical-induced oxidation of the red blood cells. Preparation Tea leaves are harvested in the early spring and stored until the late summer when fresh jasmine flowers are in bloom. Jasmine flowers are picked early in the day when the small petals are tightly closed. The flowers are kept cool until nightfall. During the night, jasmine flowers open, releasing their fragrance. This is when the tea scenting takes place. There are two main methods used to scent the tea with the jasmine. In one method the tea and flowers are placed in alternating layers; in the other, the tea is blended with jasmine flowers and stored overnight. It takes over four hours for the tea to absorb the fragrance and flavour of the jasmine blossoms. The scenting process may be repeated as many as six or seven times for top grades such as Yin Hao. The tea absorbs moisture from the fresh Jasmine flowers so it must be dried again to prevent spoilage.  Cultural uses  A cup of jasmine tea In northern China it is customary to serve Jasmine tea as a welcoming gesture to guests. Jasmine tea is the local tea beverage of Fuzhou, while jasmine flowers are its municipal flower. Jasmine has symbolic meanings in the Chinese culture. This flower is not only the symbol of eternal love, but one of the holy flowers of Buddhism as well. For example, the crown of the Buddhist in the Ajanta wall paintings, a world heritage site, is decorated by golden jasmine flowers. The fragrance of jasmines is thought to be of heaven. In the past, people in Fuzhou considered tea as an antidote to a lot of poisons. In the Fuzhou dialect, the word for buying medicine literally means buying tea; brewing medicine, brewing tea; taking medicine, drinking tea. In addition, tea culture is important by shaping the art of drinking tea which follows different steps.  Fuzhou Jasmine Tea  Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian, is the most important city in producing jasmine tea in China. The city is built at a river basin and surrounded by mountains. The climate in Fuzhou is mild, rainfall is abundant and the day-night temperature difference is obvious, creating favorable conditions for jasmine flowers to grow. And there is also the microclimate needed for tea trees -- jasmines are planted near rivers, while tea trees grow on slopes 600 to 1,000 meters above the sea level. Fuzhou has 1,200 hectares of tea gardens and last year it produced 110,000 tons of jasmine tea, worth 1.78 billion yuan ($290 million). After the jasmine plant was introduced into Fuzhou, people planted the flower broadly. During 960-1127, the Song Dynasty, Fuzhou gained the name of \\"The City of Jasmine in China\\". Fuzhou is regarded as the origin of the jasmine tea production process, and so far it is the only city to contain the complete production process. The jasmine tea making process started from the Tang Dynasty and had a great change in the Ming Dynasty. Before 1937, the development of Fuzhou Jasmine tea was fast and products were sold to many regions. Because of the war, the output dropped quickly. During 1950s-1990s the industry revived and reached 60% of the total national production, but after that, it fell again. The government is still working on reviving Fuzhou jasmine tea. In recent years, the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and government strove to protect and develop the system of Fuzhou jasmine planting and tea culture, and took active measures to cultivate good stock and applied for the heritage list. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations awarded the \\"Fuzhou jasmine tea and tea culture system\\" as one of the \\"Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems\\".

In Beijing, hutongs are alleys formed by lines of siheyuan, traditional courtyard residences. Many neighbourhoods were formed by joining one siheyuan to another to form a hutong, and then joining one hutong to another. The word hutong is also used to refer to such neighbourhoods. Since the mid-20th century, many Beijing hutongs were demolished to make way for new roads and buildings. More recently, however, many hutongs have been designated as protected, in an attempt to preserve this aspect of Chinese cultural history. Hutongs were first established in the Yuan dynasty (1279‚Äì1368) and then expanded in the Ming (1368‚Äì1644) and Qing (1644‚Äì1911) dynasties.  Historical hutongs  A residential hutong A typical courtyard of a Hutong. On the roof the owner keeps his pigeons During China's dynastic period, emperors planned the city of Beijing and arranged the residential areas according to the social classes of the Zhou Dynasty (1027‚Äì256 BC). The term \\"hutong\\" appeared first during the Yuan Dynasty, and is a term of Mongolian origin, meaning \\"water well\\". In the Ming Dynasty (early 15th century), the center was the Forbidden City, surrounded in concentric circles by the Inner City and Outer City. Citizens of higher social status were permitted to live closer to the center of the circles. Aristocrats lived to the east and west of the imperial palace. The large siheyuan of these high- ranking officials and wealthy merchants often featured beautifully carved and painted roof beams and pillars and carefully landscaped gardens. The hutongs they formed were orderly, lined by spacious homes and walled gardens. Farther from the palace, and to its north and south, were the commoners, merchants, artisans, and laborers. Their siheyuan were far smaller in scale and simpler in design and decoration, and the hutongs were narrower. Nearly all siheyuan had their main buildings and gates facing south for better lighting; thus a majority of hutongs run from east to west. Between the main hutongs, many tiny lanes ran north and south for convenient passage. Historically, a hutong was also once used as the lowest level of administrative geographical divisions within a city in ancient China, as in the paifang (ÁâåÂùä) system: the largest division within a city in ancient China was a fang (Âùä), equivalent to current day ward. Each fang (Âùä) was enclosed by walls or fences, and the gates of these enclosures were shut and guarded every night, somewhat like a modern gated community. Each fang (Âùä) was further divided into several plate or pai (Áâå), which is equivalent to a current day (unincorporated) community (or neighborhood). Each pai (Áâå), in turn, contained an area including several hutongs, and during the Ming Dynasty, Beijing was divided into a total of 36 fangs (Âùä). However, as the ancient Chinese urban administration division system gave way to population and household divisions instead of geographical divisions, the hutongs were no longer used as the lowest level of administrative geographical division and were replaced with other divisional approaches.  In the Republic of China era  At the turn of the 20th century, the Qing court was disintegrating as China's dynastic era came to an end. The traditional arrangement of hutongs was also affected. Many new hutongs, built haphazardly and with no apparent plan, began to appear on the outskirts of the old city, while the old ones lost their former neat appearance. The social stratification of the residents also began to evaporate, reflecting the collapse of the feudal system. Many such hutong-like areas have been demolished. During the period of the Republic of China from 1911 to 1948, society was unstable, fraught with civil wars and repeated foreign invasions. Beijing deteriorated, and the conditions of the hutongs worsened. Siheyuans previously owned and occupied by single families were subdivided and shared by many households, with additions tacked on as needed, built with whatever materials were available. The 978 hutongs listed in Qing Dynasty records swelled to 1,330 by 1949. Today, in some hutongs, such as those in Da Shi Lan, the conditions remain poor.  In the People's Republic  Hutong roofscapes viewed from Drum Tower Following the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, many of the old hutongs of Beijing disappeared, replaced by wide boulevards and high-rises. Many residents left the lanes where their families lived for generations for apartment buildings with modern amenities. In Xicheng District, for example, nearly 200 hutongs out of the 820 it held in 1949 have disappeared. However, many of Beijing's ancient hutongs still stand, and a number of them have been designated protected areas. The older neighborhoods survive today, offering a glimpse of life in the capital city as it has been for generations. Many hutongs, some several hundred years old, in the vicinity of the Bell Tower and Drum Tower and Shichahai Lake are preserved amongst recreated contemporary two- and three-story versions.http://archrecord.construction.com/features/beijing/warpspeed/0807beijing-3.asp This area abounds with tourists, many of which tour the quarter in pedicabs. Today, as in the past, hutongs are home to celebrities, business owners and officials. After the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests, Zhao Ziyang spent his fifteen years of house arrest inside a hutong. Zhao's hutong had previously been occupied by one of Empress Dowager Cixi's hairdressers.Becker, Jasper. \\"Zhao Ziyang: Chinese Leader Who 'Came too Late' to Tiananmen Square\\". The Independent. January 18, 2005. Retrieved September 18, 2011.  Culture  Hutongs represent an important cultural element of the city of Beijing. Thanks to Beijing's long history and status as capital for six dynasties, almost every hutong has its anecdotes, and some are even associated with historic events. In contrast to the court life and elite culture represented by the Forbidden City, Summer Palace, and the Temple of Heaven, the hutongs reflect the culture of grassroots Beijingers. The hutongs are residential neighborhoods which still form the heart of Old Beijing. A virtual tour of one of Beijing's Hutong's can be found here. Since 2014, an exploration game has been developed called ÂüéË∞úËóè or Hidden City Game. Teams explore hutongs within one city block in detail and complete activities based on art, food, calligraphy, history and technology and often with local businesses.  Other information  Each hutong has a name. Some have had only one name since their creation, while others have had several throughout their history. Many hutongs were named after their location, or a local landmark or business, such as: *City gates, such as Inner Xizhimen Hutong, indicating this hutong is located in the \\"Xizhimen Nei\\", or \\"Xizhimen Within\\", neighbourhood, which is on the city side of Xizhimen Gate, a gate on the city wall. *Markets and businesses, such as Yangshi Hutong (Yangshi literally means sheep market), or Yizi Hutong (a local term for soap is yizi) *Temples, such as Guanyinsi Hutong (Guanyinsi is the Kuan-yin Temple) *Local features, such as Liushu Hutong (Liushu means willow), which was originally named \\"Liushujing Hutong\\", litearlly \\"Willow Tree Well Hutong\\", after a local well. Some hutongs were named after people, such as Mengduan Hutong (named after Meng Duan, a mayor of Beijing in the Ming Dynasty whose residence was in this hutong). Others were given an auspicious name, with words with generic positive attributes, such as Xiqing Hutong (Xiqing means happy) Hutongs sharing a name, or longer hutongs divided into sections, are often identified by direction. for example, there are three Hongmen Hutong (\\"Red Gate Hutong\\"), being the West Hongmen Hutong, the East Hongmen Hutong, and the South Hongmen Hutong (all three hutongs have been completely obliterated as of 2011 and no longer exist). While most Beijing hutongs are straight, Jiudaowan Hutong turns nineteen times. Located near Beixinqiao Station, its name ‰πùÈÅìÂºØ literally means \\"Nine Turns\\". At its narrowest section, Qianshi Hutong near Qianmen (Front Gate) is only 40 centimeters wide.

Publication history Arclight first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #210-211 (October‚ÄìNovember 1986), and was created by Chris Claremont and John Romita Jr. The character subsequently appears in X-Factor #10 (November 1986), Thor #373 (November 1986), Power Pack #27 (December 1986), Uncanny X-Men #213 (January 1987), 215 (March 1987), 219 (July 1987), 221-223 (September‚ÄìOctober 1987), 240 (January 1989), Captain America #387-392 (July‚ÄìSeptember 1991), X-Man #13 (March 1996), 18-19 (August‚ÄìSeptember 1996), Cable Annual 1999, X-Men: The 198-Files (March 2006), X-Men #183 (April 2006), X-Men: The 198 #2-5 (April‚ÄìJuly 2006), Civil War: X-Men #3 (November 2006), X-Men #200-203 (August‚ÄìNovember 2007), and New X-Men #46 (March 2008). Walt Simonson said that \\"when Jon Bogdanove drew Arclight in Power Pack, she had a much different figure than I gave her in X-Factor. But I went back and did a little bit of revision work in my book after I'd seen what John had done.\\" Arclight received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89 #1. Fictional character biography Arclight served with the American ground forces during the Vietnam War, and she is still haunted by memories of that place.X-Factor vol. 1 #10 (November 1986) She has redirected her rage into bodybuilding, which she uses to augment her mutant powers. Her mutant ability enables her to create shock waves through physical contact, usually combined with her super strength in form of punches and blows. During a few of her appearances she has been shown to project a bright light upon impact of her hands. As a war veteran, she is well versed in battle and is known as one of the most bloodthirsty members of the Marauders, the group responsible for the \\"Mutant Massacre\\". Her relationship with teammate Scalphunter has also made her second-in-command. During their first mission, Arclight kills dozens of underground-dwelling mutants known as Morlocks. She also took some time off to answer Superia's invitation to join her female group of villains, the Femizons.Power Pack vol. 1 #27 (December 1986) Though the details of her recruitment by Mister Sinister to the Marauders remain unrevealed, she has participated in all of the group's major operations. Due to Sinister cloning the Marauders multiple times, it is hard to determine if the 'original' Arclight has been present in all of them. Following M-Day, Arclight became one of the so-called 198, one of the few remaining mutants retaining their powers, and a refugee at the X-Mansion.X-Men: The 198 #2-5 (April‚ÄìJuly 2006) She later returns as a member of the New Marauders, alongside old members like Scalphunter and new ones like Sunfire and Lady Mastermind.X-Men vol. 2 #200 During Messiah CompleX in the final battle on Muir Isle, she is injured by Wolfsbane who bites her in the neck.X-Men #200-203 (August‚ÄìNovember 2007) She is seen later being defeated by Rockslide.New X-Men #46 (March 2008) Powers and abilities Arclight possesses the ability to generate seismic energies with her hands that cause shock waves and geo tremors. She also has superhuman strength, stamina, durability and resiliency. Other versions In the House of M reality, Arclight (alongside Mentallo and Wild Child) is a member of the Red Guard that was positioned in Australia to work with Exodus.Hulk: Broken Worlds #1 In other media =Television= * Arclight appeared in the two-part X-Men episode \\"Sanctuary\\". She is among the mutants that join Magneto's mutant haven. In the episode \\"Secrets Not Long Buried\\", she is one of the many residents of the mutant-dominated community of Skull Mesa.X-Men episode \\"Sanctuary\\" * Arclight first appears in the Wolverine and the X-Men episode \\"eXcessive Force\\". This Arclight is male, and he is supposedly the field leader of the Marauders taking direct orders from Mister Sinister. He utilizes the same shock wave powers as his mainstream and movie counterparts. When Vertigo arrives to warn him about Cyclops coming, he is attacked while Vertigo flees. Mister Sinister gets contacted by him and is given orders to give Cyclops information that would lead him into a trap.Wolverine & The X-Men episode \\"eXcessive Force\\" =Film= * Arclight appeared in the 2006 motion picture X-Men: The Last Stand played by Dominican fashion model and actress Omahyra Mota. Arclight is first shown with Callisto and Psylocke as Magneto attempts to recruit them in his team. This is the one scene she appears to not be wearing her leather jacket as she does so for the remaining of the movie. She is then seen at Jean's house being knocked out by Storm as she attempts to stop her by Magneto's orders. At Alcatraz, after she and her team are nearly shot at, she's saved and as she comes up to find out she's okay, Magneto yells at her to come up and use her as the first big move in his plan, which is to use her power against their enemies. Arclight had no lines in the film. The closest thing she had to a line was a forceful grunt as she attempts to attack the soldiers and disarm them. In the movie, her shock wave-based superpowers are more refined than in the comic book: her shock waves project in an outward fashion and she can target specific materials. During the raid on Alcatraz, Arclight used her shockwaves to disable the cure weapons and later joined Quill and Psylocke in targeting Warren Worthington II. She, Quill, and Psylocke are later killed by Jean Grey's disintegration wave when her Dark Phoenix side activates. =Video games= * Arclight appears in Deadpool, voiced by Chani Krich.\\"The Marauders Confirmed for Deadpool Video Game,\\" ComingSoon.net She is a member of the Marauders and the game's first boss. The encounter ends with Arclight dying upon being impaled on a piece of rebar. A clone of Arclight later fights Deadpool near Mr. Sinister's hideout at Magneto's old citadel, and also ends up killed.

Tetram is the common Russian name for the substance. Amiton was the trade name for the substance when it was marketed as an insecticide by ICI in the mid-1950s. Chemical With a toxicity of about 1/10 that of VX, i.e. similar to that of sarin, it is now considered too dangerous for use in agriculture but unlike other nerve agents it is classified under Schedule 2 of the Chemical Weapons Convention rather than the more restrictive Schedule 1. It is thought that North Korea may have military stockpiles of this chemical . During the early 1950s at least three chemical companies working on organo-phosphorus insecticides independently discovered the severe toxicity of these chemicals. In 1952, Dr. Ranajit Ghosh, a chemist working for ICI at their Plant Protection Laboratories at Jealott's Hill was investigating the potential of organophosphate esters of substituted aminoethanethiols for use as pesticides. Like the earlier German investigators of organophosphates in the late 1930s who had discovered the G-series nerve agents, Dr. Ghosh discovered that their action on cholinesterase made them effective pesticides. One of them, Amiton, was described in a 1955 paper by Ghosh and another chemist, J. F. Newman, as being particularly effective against mites. It was brought to market as an insecticide by the company in 1954 but was subsequently withdrawn as too toxic. The toxicity of these substances had not passed unnoticed by the British Government, as some of the compounds had already been sent to their research facility at Porton Down for evaluation. Some of the chemicals from this class of compounds formed a new group of nerve agents called V Agents. The British Government unilaterally renounced chemical and biological weapons in 1956, although in 1958 traded their research on VG technology with the United States Government in exchange for information on thermonuclear weapons. The US then went into production of large amounts of the chemically similar, but much more toxic VX in 1961. It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

Little is known about this compound other than its chemical formula. It is commonly theorized that the so-called \\"second-generation\\" V series agents came from a cold war era Russian chemical weapons development program. They may have been developed sometime between 1950 and 1990. They have similar lethal dose levels to VX (between 10‚Äì50 mg) and have similar symptoms and method of action to other nerve agents that act on cholinesterase, and treatment remains the same, but the window for effectively treating second generation V series seizures is shorter. In addition to the standard seizures, some of the second generation V series agents are known to cause comas.

It compiles songs from their Fat EP (1981) and the albums Milo Goes to College (1982), I Don't Want to Grow Up (1985), Enjoy! (1986), and All (1987).  Background  In 1987 SST Records had purchased the Descendents' previous label New Alliance Records, releasing their 1987 album All and re-releasing all of their previous material. Following the Descendents' final tours in spring and summer 1987, singer Milo Aukerman had left the band to pursue a career in biochemistry. The remaining members‚Äîbassist Karl Alvarez, guitarist Stephen Egerton, and drummer Bill Stevenson‚Äîrelaunched the band under the name All, releasing three albums on the SST subsidiary Cruz Records between 1988 and 1991 with singers Dave Smalley and Scott Reynolds. SST also released the Descendents live albums Liveage! (1987) and Hallraker: Live! (1989), both recorded during the final two Descendents tours. Somery was released in 1991, compiling tracks from the Descendents' past studio releases. Stevenson created the cover art for the compilation while Egerton did the graphics. The Descendents would later reunite with Aukerman in 1995 to record Everything Sucks. Stevenson remarked in 1993 that \\"Somery sold more than any of the Descendents albums put together.

Rock critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A- rating, opining that the 1988 compilation Two Things at Once contained the band's best material, \\"But anyone beguiled, enthralled, or smacked between the eyes by how nakedly these guys don't quite understand their class rage and love-hungry sexual anxiety will hear through their bouts of misogyny and sophomoric humor for the 19 more tuneful if less inspired selections from three later and lesser albums, as in the tortured breakup song/metaphor 'Clean Sheets' and the fuckup/square's confession 'Coolidge'.\\" Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone called Somery \\"the only Descendents record to qualify as must-have.

Lafontaine =Lafontaine= Lafontaine was originally called Sainte-Croix (French for \\"Holy Cross\\"). It was renamed Lafontaine to honour the politician Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, one of the early Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada. In honour of the region's French history, Lafontaine hosts the annual Le Festival du Loup in July, a festival of francophone music and culture which celebrates the death of a wolf that terrorised the village in the 19th century. Geography Tiny Township is located on the peninsula that separates Severn Sound and Nottawasaga Bay at the south end of Georgian Bay, and has a coastline of . It extends southward into the Wye River watershed. The municipality is home to Awenda Provincial Park on Georgian Bay at the north end, and the Tiny Marsh Provincial Wildlife Area, source of the Wye River, in the south. Tiny contains an artesian well that produces some of the purest spring water in the world. Many residents were concerned that a proposed garbage dump over the aquifer would contaminate the water, and a series of protests achieved a one-year moratorium on the dump. The dump's certificate of approval was later revoked by the province in 2010.\\"Province buries Site 41 dump site in Simcoe\\", Toronto Star May 26, 2010 History The township was named in 1822 after a pet dog of Lady Sarah Maitland (1792‚Äì1873), wife of Sir Peregrine Maitland, Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. Two other adjoining townships were also named for her pet dogs, Tay and Flos (now Springwater Township).Rayburn, Alan (1997), Place Names of Ontario (University of Toronto Press), Toronto-Buffalo-London, ), pp.345 Humans have occupied the area now known as Tiny Township for at least 11,000 years. Excavations in what is now Awenda Provincial Park in the 1970s uncovered four archaeological sites dating from the Paleo-Indian period.Friends of Awenda Provincial Park (2012), \\"Cultural Heritage\\" http://www.awendapark.ca/?page_id=79 For much of the Pre- Contact period, the Indigenous peoples of the area would have been hunter- gathers living mostly in small family groupings which would come together in larger groupings during particular times of the year to collect resources such as fish or berries.Friends of Awenda Provincial Park (2012), \\"Native Occupation\\" http://www.awendapark.ca/?page_id=375 Around 1100 C.E., agriculture was introduced to south Central Ontario, with people growing corn, beans, squash, tobacco, and sunflowers. This led to the development of villages centred around longhouses. By 1600 C.E., the five nations of the Huron-Wendat Confederacy had established their villages in the territory they called Wendake, a part of which included what we now call Tiny Township. Starting in 1615, French Catholic missionaries, first Recollets and then, in 1625, Jesuits, began proselytizing among the Huron-Wendat.Heidenreich, C.E (2011) \\"Huron-Wendat\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/huron/ The Jesuits built the mission Sainte-Marie among the Hurons and wrote extensively about the Huron- Wendat culture. In 1636, Jesuit missionary Jean de Brebeuf observed and wrote about The Huron Feast of the Dead which occurred at the Huron-Wendat village of Ossossane which was located in what is now Tiny Township. Diseases brought by the French in this period had a devastating effect on the Huron-Wendat. It is estimated that circa 1600, just prior to European contact, the total population of Wendake was between 20 000 and 25 000 people. However, a series of epidemics between 1634 and 1642 reduced the population to about 9000 people. Attacks by the Haudenosaunee in 1648 and 1649 dispersed the Wendat people, with most traditionalists joining the Haudenosaunee, while others joined with the related, neighbouring Petun people. The remaining Huron-Wendat who followed the missionaries fled to French Territory. In the 1700s, as the threat from the Haudenosaunee waned, Ojibwe people began to move back into the area. In 1798, the Ojibwe (Chippeway) and the British signed Penetanguishene Bay Purchase turning some of the land which would become Tiny Township over to the British who soon after established a naval base at Penetanguishene. A subsequent treaty in 1815, the Lake Simcoe‚ÄìLake Huron Purchase turned over the remaining part of the land which would become Tiny Township. By the mid-19th century, families from Quebec began moving to the Tiny Township area for the cheap and fertile land to farm. The Baldwin Act of 1850 established the Corporation of the United Townships of Tiny and Tay. In 1868, the townships were separated through a Simcoe County by-law. Demographics While the regular population is fairly small, the region is a popular summer destination both for tourism and cottagers, increasing the township‚Äôs population to approximately 27,000. Tiny Township area is still very much a bilingual (French and English) area of Ontario, and is one of 25 municipalities in Ontario designated for bilingual government services under the French Language Services Act.

The station was opened in 1885 as part of the Victorian expansion of dormitory suburbs, and was one of the stations included in the Metro-land project in the early 20th century. The site is served by several bus routes including links to the Hatch End railway station which was known as Pinner & Hatch End prior to 1920. Step free facilities were opened in 2008. Its adjacent stations are Northwood Hills (northbound) and North Harrow (southbound). Pinner is served by all stations and semi-fast services, one should change at Moor Park for fast service northbound Metropolitan line services. This change is only needed on Mondays-Fridays during peak hours. History The gardens at Pinner station, London Underground Station Garden winner in 1966. The station was opened on 25 May 1885, following a prior expansion to nearby Harrow-on-the- Hill station in 1880. It remained the terminus of the Metropolitan Railway until 1 September 1887 when the line was further extended to Rickmansworth. The long, single-story station building on the up (southbound) platform is the original building, and resembles the stations at Rickmansworth, Chorleywood and Chalfont & Latimer. The down platform buildings were built during the four-tracking project of the 1950s and 60s in a matching yellow brick. In 1915, the Metro-land project was conceived in order to move people out of central London into rural Middlesex. Houses near the stations were built in haste and sold for as little as ¬£400 each. However, in Pinner houses built during this expansion were required to be worth at least ¬£1,000 - compared to Harrow-on-the-Hill where prices were subject to a ¬£750 minimum. The station building on Station Approach is locally listed by the Harrow Council. Location London bus routes 183, H11, H12 and H13 serve the station's location and provide services that terminate at Golders Green, Harrow, Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood Hills, Ruislip, South Harrow and Stanmore. The H12 route also connects Pinner tube station to Hatch End railway station, which was named Pinner & Hatch End between 1911 and 1920 before being renamed Hatch End (for Pinner) and then, in 1956, Hatch End. Northwood Hills station is to the north west and North Harrow is to the south east on the Metropolitan line. Access to the southbound platform is step-free from the ticket hall. In order to reach the northbound platform, it is necessary to use a footbridge, which was constructed in 2002. Before this, a subway between the two platforms existed, but this was closed for safety reasons. Accessibility lifts opened on 18 July 2008 making the station totally step-free. Originally scheduled for installation in 2005, the delay had been caused by a lack of funding and was originally rescheduled for 2009/10 but following complaints by the Harrow Public Transport Users Association the construction was brought forward to 2007 only to be delayed by the collapse of London Underground contractors Metronet. Services In the northbound direction off-peak the station is served by trains to Watford (4tph), Amersham (2tph) and Chesham (2tph) trains (at peak times, 'fast' trains do not stop at stations between Harrow-on-the- Hill and Moor Park). In the southbound direction off-peak services generally run 4tph to Baker Street and 4tph to Aldgate.

He and his brother played a key role in capturing a French vessel. James remained in the army, stationed at various frontier posts. In 1763 he raised and commanded a corps of two hundred men, who were designated as \\"Guards of the Frontier\\". After the war he retired and married Mary De Witt. =American Revolutionary War= A month after the first open armed conflict in Lexington, the Continental Congress resolved on May 25, 1775 to build fortifications in the Hudson highlands for the purpose of protecting and maintaining control of the Hudson River. James Clinton and Christopher Tappan, lifetime residents of the area, were sent to scout appropriate locations. Clinton was commissioned as the colonel of the 3rd New York Regiment, which took part in Brig. Gen. Richard Montgomery‚Äôs unsuccessful expedition to Quebec in 1775. In March 1776, Clinton took command of the 2nd New York Regiment and soon after, in August, was promoted to brigadier general in the Continental Army.

In 1778 he was stationed in Albany to oppose Indian and Tory forces.Sullivan Campaign of the Revolutionary War: The Impact on Livingston County Plaque on the Monument at the site of Gen. Clinton's dam In 1779, Clinton led an expedition down the Susquehanna River after making the upper portion navigable by damming up the river's source at Otsego Lake, allowing the lake's level to rise, and then destroying the dam and flooding the river for miles downstream. This event is described by James Fenimore Cooper in the introduction to his popular novel The Pioneers, and commemorated by a Memorial Day canoe race. At Tioga, New York, Clinton met up with General John Sullivan's forces, who had marched from Easton, Pennsylvania. Together, on August 29, they defeated the Tories and Indians at the Battle of Newtown (near today's city of Elmira, New York). This became known as the \\"Sullivan-Clinton Campaign\\" or the \\"Sullivan Expedition.\\" In 1780, Clinton temporarily commanded the Northern Department. By October 1781, his brigade had joined George Washington's army in the siege of Yorktown. =Post-war years= After he left the army, Clinton served on the commission defining the New York-Pennsylvania boundary.

Hard labour: job burnout, Financial Post (\\"Tod Maffin, a digital marketing strategist at Vancouver consultancy tMedia Strategies\\") and keynote speaker specializing in social media, mobile marketing, and viral marketing, as well as using social media for employer and school recruitment. Background Maffin was born and raised in the Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada area. He began his career in journalism, working for KBS radio in Creston in the early '90s as a reporter and weekend anchor. He then moved to the Sunday Press, a community newspaper based in Sechelt, BC, as the lead civic affairs reporter. =Technology= Maffin became the Director of New Media at the Haibeck Group, a Vancouver- based public relations firm, developing the early web strategies for large corporate clients. He joined the Internet services firm Emerge Online in 1995 as its Senior Strategist and, later, Vice President of Marketing. In 1997, Maffin moved to Emerge's competitor, IMEDIAT (later rebranded as communicate.com) where, as Executive V.P. of Marketing, he led the company's rapid growth into new markets. Maffin left IMEDIAT to start his own web strategy consulting firm and, in 1999, developed the concept for an artificial intelligence engine that could rank the subjective mood of public opinion. He and three other partners launched MindfulEye.com, developing Maffin's idea into a technology service (\\"Lexant\\") which began selling services to major brokerage firms and securities commissions. The Lexant engine was used to perform syntactic analysis on public opinion comments posted on the Internet and aired in the media, in order to provide a ‚Äúmood monitor‚Äù of stocks. MindfulEye.com began trading publicly in 18 months through an RTO of a Nevada firm. The firm initially raised three rounds of venture capital but got caught in the \\"dot com bomb\\" and had to close down when it was unable to secure additional funding. Today, Maffin is president of engageQ digital, a social engagement agency in Canada. =Radio and television= Maffin is a regular guest-host on Roundhouse Radio 98.3 FM and a commentator on technology and business trends in the media. He co-produced and hosted the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's live interactive national radio program \\"todradio.com\\" on CBC Radio One for two seasons beginning in 2002. The series aired live across all of Canada's five time zones using five separate shows, each unique to its region. It was co-hosted by Tamara Leer. Maffin also spent four years as a national producer on CBC Radio One's Definitely Not The Opera magazine program. During this period, he authored \\"From Idea to Air: A Field Guide to Freelancing for Public Radio\\". He also hosted and produced a short- lived radio documentary program called \\"Real Life Chronicles\\" which ran regionally as part of CBC Vancouver's North by Northwest weekend arts program. It was later picked up by the network and aired during CBC Radio's flagship morning program \\"Sounds Like Canada.\\" As part of the network's coverage of the 2004 federal election, Maffin crossed much of the country in the CBC's \\"Canada Votes\\" election bus which traveled Canada producing stories and short documentaries about Canadians' reaction to the election campaign. He then began weekly television reports on technology on CBC Television's Canada Now national newscast and also worked as CBC Radio's national technology columnist. During the CBC's 2005 labour dispute, Maffin produced a blog and podcast which became the focal point for news about the labour dispute, generating more than 10,000 unique visits a day near the end of the lockout. After the lockout, the CBC hired Maffin to create and author its official blog, InsideTheCBC.com. In 2008, Maffin handed the editorship over to Paul McGrath, a CBC employee. Blogtv.com also hired Maffin to do a live, weekly webcast program on technology, todbits.tv. The program covered trends in business technology, web strategy, and consumer electronics. =Books= Maffin is the author of four books: * From Idea to Air: A Field Guide to Writing for Public Radio * Bashtagged! Surviving a Twitter Attack * DRIVE! A Busy Realtor's Guide to Social Media * TOUCH: Five Factors to Growing and Leading a Human Organization (published October 2014 by Dundurn Press) =Podcasting= Maffin's podcasts have included the series Egg McMaffin, which highlighted Maffin's picks in public radio short documentaries. It later changed focus to feature informative tips on doing tasks people take for granted, becoming the How To Do Stuff podcast. Maffin was an early supporter of podcasting, and at one point embarked on a national tour of eleven cities to evangelize the technology. Holding \\"meetups\\" in each city, Maffin assisted new podcast producers. He also was hired by CBC Radio to develop the network's podcasting strategy and internal publishing tools. He launched and managed CanadaPodcasts.ca, a national podcast directory, and started the Foursevens Podcast Collective, one of the world's first podcast networks ‚Äî a collection of podcasts he thought represented the best in content, eventually turning CanadaPodcasts.ca over to the Rogic Network when he ceased producing podcasts. Today, he produces two podcasts: # Today in Digital Marketing, a short daily newscast about developments in online advertising, social media, and Internet PR # The Nanaimo Chronicles, an infrequent series about the small Vancouver Island city Nanaimo, B.C. =Speaking= Maffin speaks to between 35 and 50 conferences and meetings a year, mostly in the US and Canada, on topics related to digital communications.

In 1998, he won the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award and led the American League (AL) in saves and games finished. In 1998-99, Gordon set a then-MLB record with 54 consecutive saves. Early life Gordon was one of several children born to Annie and Thomas Gordon. He was raised in abject poverty and his parents could not afford a telephone. Gordon attended Avon Park High School in Avon Park, Florida, and was a letterman in baseball. He was selected in the sixth round of the 1986 MLB Draft by the Kansas City Royals. He received a $38,000 signing bonus. Major league career =Early career= Gordon began his career as a starting pitcher with the Kansas City Royals, first appearing in five games at the age of 20 late in the 1988 season. He became an immediate sensation in Kansas City the following year, posting a 17-9 record and a 3.64 ERA in his first full season, and he finished second in the 1989 Rookie of the Year balloting. Gordon also recorded 153 strikeouts in 1989, the tenth highest total in the American League, which earned him the nickname \\"Flash.\\" Gordon continued to post top-10 strikeout totals during the 1990 and 1991 seasons, but his number of wins dropped each year while his ERA crept upwards. Finally, in 1992 Gordon had one of the worst season of his career, posting a 6-10 record and a 4.59 ERA. He bounced back with seasons of 11 or 12 wins from 1993 to 1995, but he never quite regained his rookie form. Prior to the 1996 season, Gordon left Kansas City and signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox. In his first season in Boston, Gordon had a 12-9 record and a 5.59 ERA ‚Äì the highest ERA of his career to that point. Over the next two years, however, the Red Sox converted Gordon from a starting pitcher to a closer and his career reignited. In 1998, Gordon set the club's single-season record for saves (46), with 43 of them in a row, and was named to his first All-Star Team. His success continued in 1999 setting a major league record with his 54th consecutive save in June, but an ongoing elbow injury limited him to just 21 appearances, which required ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction (or UCL) also known as Tommy John surgery, that forced him to spend all of 2000 on the disabled list. His popularity in Boston at this point led New England-based writer and Red Sox fan Stephen King to reference him as the object of infatuation for the young protagonist of the 1999 novel The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. After subsequent stops in Houston and both sides of Chicago, Gordon landed in New York. He was an invaluable addition to the Yankees bullpen, serving as a set-up for closer Mariano Rivera, or as a middle reliever in tough situations. =2006-07= At this point, Gordon had compiled a career 122-111 record with 1733 strikeouts, a 3.99 ERA, 114 saves, and 1,896.2 innings in 671 games (203 as a starter). He signed a three-year deal worth $18 million with the Phillies before the 2006 season. Gordon debuted in Philadelphia as a closer during the 2006 season, replacing Billy Wagner, who signed with the Mets after the 2005 season. On May 2, 2007, Gordon was placed on the disabled list due to a rotator cuff inflammation, at which time he was replaced in the closer slot by former starting pitcher Brett Myers. Following both pitchers' return from the DL, Myers retained the closer position, while Gordon was shifted to a late-inning reliever. Flash was named to the 2006 NL All Star Team as the leading vote getter from the players. =2008= Gordon had fully rehabilitated his arm and was prepared for the '08 season. However, on July 6, 2008, Gordon was placed on the 15-day disabled list for tenderness in his right elbow. Fellow reliever Brad Lidge praised Gordon calling him \\"a stud\\" and said that the Phils were hoping for him to return to the team after his 15-day stint. Prior to being placed on the disabled list, Gordon recorded a 13.45 earned run average giving up six runs in four total innings since June 11. He eventually was ruled out for the season but was able to earn his only World Series ring on the bench in the 2008 World Series. =2009= On February 6, , Gordon signed a one-year deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. After spending most of the season on the disabled list, he was released on August 11. =2010= On August 9, Gordon said that he still thinks he has what it takes to compete, but that he's \\"fine\\" with retirement.

Anthony was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the 26th round of the 1987 draft and played 7 minor league seasons. Pough was drafted in the third round by the Cleveland Indians a year later and played 7 seasons in MiLB followed by one season in the Mexican League and five in the Atlantic League.

The Palacio de Lecumberri is a large building, formerly a prison, in the northeast of Mexico City, Mexico, which now houses the General National Archive (Archivo General de la Naci√≥n). Known in popular culture as The Black Palace of Lecumberri, it served as a penitentiary from 1900 to 1976. It was inaugurated by President Porfirio D√≠az. The building was decommissioned as a prison in 1976 and turned over to the country's National Archive in 1980. The National Archive is one of the oldest historical archives in the Americas. Location, design and use From behind bars. Blueprint of the Lecumberri Prison. thumb245x245px Construction of the Lecumberri prison thumb242x242px Final Completion to the Lecumberri Prison Construction of the Lecumberri Prison, view from the top Palacio de Lecumberri is located at the North East border of Mexico City's Federal District. The building was used as a prison from 1900‚Äì1976, and as the Country's National Archive from 1980 onwards. The prison was mainly constructed to contain major political advisers of the opposing side, or other criminals to the nation from the time of operation. Construction began in 1888. The inspiration and design of the Palacio is by Miguel S. Macedo, who was later on imprisoned there for several months during the Mexican Revolution. The design is said to have been based on that of Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon.See page 85 of Muy interesante (No. 2, 2008), a Mexican journal for the diffusion of science published by Editorial Televisa Internacional (ISSN 0188-0659. This design allows for a single guard to observe all the prisoners without them being able to tell when the guard is looking; they therefore act as though they are always being watched. The prison was built to hold 800 men, 180 women and 400 children. It had 804 cells, workshops, a nursery, cooking and baking workshops. There was also an area of government, a section dedicated to medical and waiting rooms. Living conditions Photo of a Jail cell from the Lecumberri prison The Diary of Lecumberri by Colombian Poet √Ålvaro Mutis, describes his time thereafter being imprisoned in 1958. The living conditions within the prison were very dangerous due to the inmates' treatment by the guards or staff. Torture and beatings were common. Corruption was also present within the prison system. Inmates The majority of the early inmates were political threats to Porfirio D√≠az and his administration. During the Mexico 68 student protests and the Dirty War of the 1970s it held left wing political prisoners. There were a few notable people imprisoned there over the years including: David Alfaro Siqueiros, Juan Gabriel, Roberto \\"Anulfo\\" Villegas, Heberto Castillo, Trotsky's murderer Ram√≥n Mercader, Gregorio C√°rdenas Hern√°ndez and Jos√© Revueltas. During La decena tr√°gica in 1913, President Francisco I. Madero and Vice President Jos√© Mar√≠a Pino Su√°rez were murdered while en route to Lecumberri. Throughout its 76-year use as a prison, only two people escaped alive. The first, Pancho Villa, was a general of the Mexican Revolution who made his escape in 1912. The second was Dwight Worker, an American convicted of smuggling cocaine. With the aid of his then-wife Worker escaped on December 17, 1975, disguised as a woman. They later authored a book about their experiences entitled Escape (). National Archives  The Archivo General de la Naci√≥n (General Archive of the Nation) is charged by the Mexican state to \\"be the governing body of the national archives and the central consultative entity of the Federal Executive.\\" The writer Edmundo O'Gorman was its general director from 1938 until 1952. It is considered the most important among its class in the Americas and one of the most important in the entire world. In November 1976 the Prison was decommissioned on the order of President Luis Echeverr√≠a and turned over to the National Archive in 1980. The archive houses millions of pages of the country‚Äôs documentary heritage. Former prison cells are now used as record repositories and the corridors between them are used as galleries in which researchers can sit and read. In June 2002, 60,000 secret police files held within the archives were opened to the public by President Vicente Fox. The files document the government's actions during the Dirty War.

Dirt cones are not actually made entirely of dirt. They have a core of ice, snow, or firn that gets covered with material and insulated. The material, if it is thick enough, will protect the underlying core from ablation.Wilson, J. Warren. ‚ÄúThe Initiation of Dirt Cones on Snow.‚Äù Journal of Glaciology, vol. 2, no.14, 1953, pp. 281-287. The thickness of material needed to insulate the core is called the ‚Äúcritical thickness.‚Äù If the material is less thick than the critical thickness, it will actually speed up erosion of the core through ablation. This is called ‚Äúindirect ablation.‚Äù The cone would then begin melting and shrinking away. Dirt cones begin forming in a crevasse or a hollow.Swithinbank, Charles. ‚ÄúThe Origin of Dirt Cones on Glaciers.‚Äù Journal of Glaciology, vol. 1, no. 8, 1950, pp. 461-465. Dirt, dust, or moraine deposit material will fall into the crevasse in the glacier and build up over time. At the same time, the surrounding glacier lowers through ablation until the dirt filled crevasse is exposed and the material begins to spread out of top of the glacier. The rest of the glacier continues to lower as the material mound grows higher and taller. Any ice, snow, or firn trapped under the material will be insulated and protected from erosion. It begins forming a conical shape as the sides steepen to an angle that is unstable. Material falls down and protects the sides. The more material is added to the top, the more insulated the core becomes. Over time, it becomes a cone with a layer of material on the outside and a core of ice, snow, or firn on the inside. The material at the top of the cone is generally thicker than the material on the sides of the dirt cone. Cones can also be found on snow patches. Many snow patches contain a certain amount of debris on them, blown in on the wind. Typically, this is a course grained sand or organic material. The sand is quite porous which makes it a poor conductor of heat. During extreme wind events, this sand or organic matter is carried onto the snow patch. The snow lying underneath the porous sand is protected from the heat and does not erode away. The snow not protected by a layer of sand or organic matter begins to erode through ablation. The protected areas accumulate more sand and eventually take on a conical shape. The core of snow is protected from ablation while the surrounding snow patch continues to melt. This is another way dirt cones can form. Even areas with a very small debris load, like Antarctica, can have dirt cones. The dirt cones in Antarctica are formed from the moraine deposit material left behind when a glacier retreats. The material making up these cones can be sorted or unsorted. Sorted moraine material is sorted by water. Sorting refers to the material size. Well-sorted material is all the same size. Unsorted material consists of all different sizes. For instance, there are smaller grained particles, like clay aggregates, next to boulders and gravel. Both sorted and unsorted moraine material is used in Antarctica to make dirt cones. Dirt cones were previously not thought to be formed in Antarctica.Campbell, I.B. and Claridge, G.G.C. ‚ÄúOccurrence of Dirt Cones in Antarctica.‚Äù New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics, vol. 18, no. 2, pp. 349-355. Some cones are only be a few centimeters tall, while others can be up to 30 meters high. The larger dirt cones are commonly multiple cones that have fused (melted) together. As an ice sheet or glacier melts and retreats, the cones on the surface are brought together and eventually fuse together. This strengthens the ice core and creates a thicker layer of material on the outside to protect the hardened core from eroding. They can develop in one winter season or they can be a product of several seasons. Sometimes, they form as a single cone or as multiple cones in a ridge on moraine deposits. Generally, there are many cones on a glacier, snow patch, or ice sheet. They may be similar in size and material. Dirt cones are found all over the globe, in both arctic and temperate regions. They are not limited to one geographic region. They have been seen in Iceland, Alaska, Antarctica, in the Himalayas, Norway, Canada, and Greenland. Many of these cones have been studied and surveyed to better understand their dynamics.Drewry, David J. ‚ÄúA Quantitative Assessment of Dirt Cone Dynamics.‚Äù Journal of Glaciology, vol. 11, no 63, 1972, pp. 431-446. All they need to form is debris of some sort and ice.

Shield In contrast to monolithic shielding of early spacecraft, Whipple shields consist of a relatively thin outer bumper spaced some distance from the main spacecraft wall. The bumper is not expected to stop the incoming particle or even remove much of its energy, but to break up and disperse it, dividing the original particle energy among many fragments that fan out between bumper and wall. The original particle energy is spread more thinly over a larger wall area, which is more likely to withstand it. A direct analogy is that a lighter bullet resistant vest is needed to stop a load of birdshot than a single rifle bullet with the same total mass and kinetic energy. Although a Whipple shield lowers total spacecraft mass compared to a solid shield, lower mass being always desirable in spaceflight, the extra enclosed volume may require a larger payload fairing. There are several variations on the simple Whipple shield. Multi-shock shields, like the one used on the Stardust spacecraft, use multiple bumpers spaced apart to increase the shield's ability to protect the spacecraft. Whipple shields that have a filling in between the rigid layers of the shield are called stuffed Whipple shields. The filling in these shields is usually a high-strength material like Kevlar or Nextel aluminium oxide fiber. The type of shield, the material, thickness and distance between layers are varied to produce a shield with minimal mass that will also minimize the probability of penetration. There are over 100 shield configurations on the International Space Station alone, with higher-risk areas having better shielding.

The caffeine-free beverage was created by Post Cereal Company founder C. W. Post in 1895 and marketed as a healthier alternative to coffee. Post was a student of John Harvey Kellogg, who believed that caffeine was unhealthy. Post Cereal Company eventually became General Foods, which was merged into Kraft Foods. Eliza's Quest Foods now owns the trademark rights and secret recipe of Postum. The \\"instant\\" drink mix version was developed in 1912, replacing the original brewed beverage. Postum is made from roasted wheat bran and molasses. In addition to the original flavor, coffee-flavored and cocoa-flavored versions have been introduced. History Postum quickly became popular, making Post wealthy. The aggressive advertising, with the slogan \\"There's a Reason,\\" warned against the alleged dangers of coffee and caffeine, and promoted the benefits of Postum. When imitations appeared, the company introduced a cheaper drink called Monk's Brew that was identical to Postum, but discontinued it after competitors left the market. Instant Postum appeared in 1911. Although the Post Cereal Company explicitly stated in its advertising that Postum did not taste like coffee and was not a coffee substitute, the drink enjoyed an enormous rise in sales and popularity in the United States during World War II when coffee was rationed and people sought a replacement. Postum was sometimes marketed by a cartoon ghost named Mister Coffee Nerves, who would appear in situations wherein people were shown in uncomfortable life situations (e.g., irritability, lack of sleep, lack of athletic prowess) due to their use of coffee and its negative effects. These cartoons always ended with the afflicted people switching to Postum and Mister Coffee Nerves fleeing until the next cartoon. The company sponsored the radio shows Lum and Abner, Beulah and The Aldrich Family, and the radio version of Father Knows Best. Postum was popular with members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and part of Mormon culture for many years because Mormons abstain from coffee. It was also popular with those following religious dietary restrictions of Seventh-day Adventists. The U.S. government used Postum as a code name for polonium,Injecting Polonium into Humans, Federation of American Scientists, December 12th, 2006 by Steven Aftergood used in the Urchin-style nuclear weapon initiators. Kraft discontinued production of Postum in 2007. In May 2012, Kraft sold the Postum trademark and trade secret to Eliza‚Äôs Quest Food, with Postum sold through the Postum.com website. As of January 2013, Eliza's Quest Food succeeded in returning Postum to many grocery stores across the United States and Canada.

He became famous because in 1763 he led a revolt of more than 2,500 slaves against the colony regime. Today, he is a national hero in Guyana.  The Berbice slave uprising  Coffy lived in Lilienburg, a plantation on the Canje River, as a house-slave for a cooper (barrel maker). He was owned by the widow Berkey. An uprising broke out at Magdalenenberg plantation, upper Canje River, in February 1763 and moved on to neighbouring plantations, attacking owners. When Dutch Governor Wolfert Simon Van Hoogenheim sent military assistance to the region, the rebellion had reached the Berbice River and was moving steadily towards the Berbice capital, Fort Nassau. They took gunpowder and guns from the attacked plantations. By 3 March the rebels were 600 in number. Led by Cossala, they tried to take the brick house of Peerenboom. They agreed to allow the whites to leave the brick house, but as soon they left, the rebels killed many and took several prisoners, among them the daughter of the Peerenboom Plantation owner, whom Coffy kept as his wife. Coffy was soon accepted by the rebels as their leader and declared himself Governor of Berbice. Doing so he named Captain Accara as his deputy in charge of military affairs, and tried to establish discipline over the troops. Accara was skilful in military discipline. They organized the farms in order to provide food supplies.  Decadency of the rebellion  Wolfert Simon Van Hoogenheim committed himself to retake the colony. Accara attacked the whites three times without permission from Coffy, and eventually the colonists were driven back. Thus began a dispute among the two rebels. On 2 April 1763 Coffy wrote to Van Hoogenheim saying that he did not want a war against the whites and proposed a partition of Berbice with the whites occupying the coastal areas and the blacks the interior. Van Hoogenheim delayed his decision replying that the Society of Berbice in Amsterdam had to make that decision and that it would take three to four months. He was waiting for support from neighboring colonies; a ship from Suriname had already arrived, and reinforcements from Barbados and Sint Eustatius soon followed. Coffy then ordered his forces to attack the whites in May 1763, but in so doing had many losses. The defeat opened a division among the rebels and weakened their organization. Accara became the leader of a new faction opposed to Coffy and led to a civil war among themselves. On 19 October 1763, it was reported to the governor that Captains Atta had revolted against Coffy, and that Coffy had committed suicide. In the meantime, the colonists had already been strengthened by the arrival of soldiers. On 15 April 1764 Captain Accabre, the last of the insurgeants, was captured.  National hero  The anniversary of the Coffy slave rebellion, 23 February, has been Republic Day in Guyana since 1970. Coffy is commemorated in the 1763 Monument in the Square of the Revolution in the capital Georgetown.

The first seven volumes deal with the Australian Imperial Force while other volumes deal with the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force at Rabaul, the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Flying Corps and the home front; the final volume is a photographic record. Unlike other official histories which have been aimed at military staff, Bean intended the Australian history to be accessible to a non-military audience. The relatively small size of the Australian forces, enabled the history to be presented in great detail, giving accounts of individual actions that would not have been possible when covering a larger force. Bean devoted over to the Battle of Fromelles, a relatively small action intended as a diversion during the Battle of the Somme, which lasted one night and involved the 5th Australian Division. Fromelles was also the first time that the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) saw action on the Western Front and was very costly for the Australians, with killed, wounded or captured.

The cocktail's origins can be traced to the United States in the 1890s, and the beverage remained widely popular in America until the 1970s. It was seen as a drink of the upper class, and has had a somewhat wide cultural impact. History of the cocktail The Stinger originated about 1890. The cocktail may have been derived from The Judge, a cocktail made with brandy, cr√®me de menthe, and simple syrup found in William Schmidt's 1892 cocktail book The Flowing Bowl. It was immediately popular in New York City, and quickly became known as a \\"society\\" drink (i.e. only for the upper classes). According to bartender Jere Sullivan in his 1930 volume The Drinks of Yesteryear: A Mixology, the Stinger remained a critical component of the bartender's repertoire until Prohibition. The Stinger was not initially seen as a cocktail (i.e. a drink served before dinner), but rather a digestif (after-dinner drink). Writing in the 1910s and 1920s, humorist Don Marquis's \\"Hermione\\" (a fictional daffy society do-gooder) refused to refer to the Stinger as a cocktail, indicating its status in upper-class society. Over time, however, the Stinger came to be consumed like a cocktail. The Stinger was a popular drink during American Prohibition, for cr√®me de menthe could mask the taste of the inferior-quality brandies then available. The Stinger began to lose favor with Americans in the late 1970s, and was not a well-known cocktail in the early 21st century. Recipe The Stinger is a duo cocktail, in that it uses only two ingredients: a spirit and a liqueur. The classic Stinger recipe uses three parts brandy and one part white cr√®me de menthe. However, Stinger recipes vary, and some recipes call for equal parts brandy and cr√®me de menthe. The mixture was originally stirred, although modern recipes call for it to be shaken with cracked ice. Early recipes required that the Stinger be served straight, but since the end of Prohibition in the United States it became more common for it to be served over crushed ice. Cognac, a type of brandy, was identified as the basis for the Stinger as early as 1905 in William \\"Cocktail\\" Boothby's supplement to his 1900 book, American Bar- Tender. In the 21st century, cognac is the most commonly used brandy cited by recipes for the Stinger's base liquor. Cocktail guides recommend that it be served in a cocktail glass if served straight, or in a rocks glass if served with ice. =Variations= The Amaretto Stinger uses a 3-to-1 ratio of amaretto to white cr√®me de menthe, while an Irish Stinger uses equal parts Irish cream liqueur and white cr√®me de menthe. The Mexican Stinger substitutes tequila for brandy. A \\"Vodka Stinger\\", also known as a White Spider, uses vodka instead of brandy. The White Way Cocktail, which celebrates Broadway theatre, is a Stinger made with gin rather than brandy. Mixologists Oliver Said and James Mellgren cite a cocktail known as the Stinger Sour. It is made with a 3-to-1-to-1 ratio of bourbon, peppermint schnapps, and lemon juice. This cocktail is not technically a Stinger, since it omits the cr√®me de menthe. Cultural impact The Stinger's popularity in New York City was so great that urban legends attributed the cocktail's genesis to famous millionaire Reginald Vanderbilt. It was further claimed that the Stinger was Vanderbilt's favorite cocktail, and he spent hours making them for his guests. The Stinger's reputation as a high-society drink led to its appearance in several famous novels. James Bond and Tiffany Case each have a Stinger in the 1956 Ian Fleming novel Diamonds are Forever. The spy Alec Leamas drinks Stingers in John le Carr√©'s 1963 novel The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. The Vodka Stinger was the drink of choice for Joanne in the play Company by Stephen Sondheim, with her calling for one in the song \\"The Ladies Who Lunch\\". The drink is also featured in the 2007 Mad Men season one episode \\"Nixon v. Kennedy\\", set in 1960. The episode features Stingers made with Bacardi rum, as Bacardi was a series sponsor. The Stinger was widely mentioned in American motion pictures. Dudley the angel (played by Cary Grant) orders a round of Stingers while lunching with ladies from the church in the 1947 film The Bishop's Wife. The evolving Stinger (used with green rather than white cr√®me de menthe) forms a plot point in the 1948 film The Big Clock, when George Stroud (Ray Milland) orders one and a random woman in the bar (Rita Johnson) already knows his name. In the 1950 Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame film In a Lonely Place, Dix Steele's lush friend Charlie orders a Stinger at Paul's bar before the first fight scene. In the 1956 Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra film High Society, Dexter-Haven's butler offers Stingers at lunch to those who over-indulged in champagne during the previous evening's party. Cary Grant again orders Stingers (\\"and keep them coming\\") as he tries to tolerate character Alice Kratzner's (Jayne Mansfield) empty-headed babbling in the 1957 comedy film Kiss Them for Me. Mr. Dobitsch (Ray Walston) instructs his Marilyn Monroe look-alike date (Joyce Jameson) in the 1960 film The Apartment to not spill the glasses of Stingers she is holding as they exit their cab and enter C.C. Baxter's (Jack Lemmon) apartment at night for a tryst. In the 1975 Warren Beatty film Shampoo, at the Republican Party dinner scene Goldie Hawn says, \\"I'll have a stinger\\", to which Tony Bill replies, \\"Before dinner?\\" In the 1983 film Gorky Park, William Hurt orders a Stinger, and Brian Dennehy makes a rude remark indicating that the drink is not reputable.

According to the Online Journalism Review, \\"BloggerCon has lots of cooks, but the chief chef is technologist Dave Winer, co-founder of RSS and the patient zero of blogging. BloggerCon exists because Winer wants it to happen.\\" BloggerCon I was initially planned to be financed without corporate sponsors by charging $500 to attend. This plan sparked controversy. A second, free day was later added to the program. For BloggerCon II and III, there was no registration cost; the conference was funded by voluntary contributions from attendees. On the first, paid day of BloggerCon I, four panels discussed the interaction of blogging with journalism, education, marketing, and presidential politics. The second day's panels included various technical and infrastructure issues such as RSS, news aggregators, and what was then called \\"audioblogging\\". The first BloggerCon brought together audioblogging pioneers with developers, whose collective efforts led to the phenomenon that spread six months later under the name podcasting. For BloggerCon II, the format was changed to create an unconference, with audience participation sessions, loosely moderated by a discussion leader, rather than formal panels or keynotes. One invited participant, Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan, was unable to get a visa. He and others were still able to participate in the discussion via an IRC channel projected on a screen. BloggerCon III met at Stanford Law School on November 6, 2004. Popular sessions included \\"Podcasting\\" with Adam Curry, \\"Overload\\" with Robert Scoble, and \\"Making Money\\" with Doc Searls. It was broadcast with help from ITConversations. Many also participated using IRC. BloggerCon helped inspire the July 30, 2005 BlogHer conference.

Found in south-eastern Afghanistan, eastern Pakistan and north-western India Description The desert lark is a medium-sized, big-headed and long-billed lark, growing to a length of . The sexes are alike, but there is considerable geographical variation. It has a rather dull plumage which can vary from quite pale to rather dark. Plumage may vary between subspecies but individuals within populations can be variable too. It is similar in appearance to the bar-tailed lark but is slightly larger, has a less-domed head, a larger broader beak, stouter legs and a longer tail. The upper parts of the many subspecies vary in colour; most are pale greyish brown, but some races are very washed out and others are quite a deep colour. Some have some rufous colour on wings and tail, similar to the bar-tailed lark, but the underparts are a pale pinkish grey and have much more streaking than that species, and the desert lark lacks the clearly defined terminal black band on the tail of that species, although it may have a rather diffuse dark patch. The colour variation seems to mainly match the habitat, so sandy-coloured birds are commoner in sandy areas, greyer birds in rocky areas and the darkest birds in desert dominated by basalt. The song is a mournful choo-wee-chacha , uttered from the ground or a boulder, or during undulating flight. It is more mellow and less squeaky than that of the bar-tailed lark. When flushed it utters a short ' or chee-lu. Distribution and habitat The desert lark is found from Mauritania, Western Sahara and southern Morocco in the west east through northern Africa south to Chad and Somalia through south west Asia to western India. It is resident (non-migratory) apart from local movements in arid stony areas, and avoids flat sand and will always be found in broken terrain with a vertical element to it Behaviour and ecology The desert lark is not very sociable and does not form large flocks, being mainly encountered in small groups or as single birds. They are territorial when breeding, nesting on the ground under the shelter of a tussock or stone in a shallow scrape lined with plant material and having a rim of pebbles, which may surround the nest or be on the more exposed side of the nest. The clutch is 1-5 eggs and these are laid at different times in various parts of its range, e.g. January‚ÄìFebruary in the south and March‚ÄìApril in the north. The desert lark eats seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season.

In 2006 Electrolux spun off Husqvarna AB into its own company, with Poulan nested beneath. History Poulan was originally an independent American company based in Shreveport, Louisiana, founded as Poulan Saw Co. in 1912 by chainsaw pioneer Claude Poulan. Purchased in late fifties or early sixties by the Beaird Company, also of Shreveport, it was known as Beaird-Poulan. The company was acquired by Emerson Electric in 1972, and was purchased by Electrolux in 1984. Poulan brand today The Poulan brand name is used primarily for outdoor power equipment, such as chainsaws, lawn mowers, and leaf blowers, aimed at the mid-level consumer market. Since Poulan is owned by Husqvarna, the two brands often share technologies. In recent years Poulan has offered a more upscale \\"Poulan Pro\\" brand employing a black and gold color scheme instead of Poulan's traditional green. As a result, Poulan products have been pushed even further upmarket. Along with Poulan, Jonsered and Husqvarna brand products, Husqvarna also provides lawn mowers, lawn tractors, and other yard equipment to Sears that are sold under Sears' Craftsman house brand name. Most mid-level Craftsman products in the power equipment segment are slightly altered Poulan products. Craftsman products made by Poulan have a \\"358\\" model prefix. Prior products made by Paramount, which was eventually purchased by Poulan, had a \\"257\\" model prefix.

Currently, he is the President of LA Galaxy, promoted on January 28, 2013, from vice president. Klein spent the entirety of his 12-year professional career playing in Major League Soccer, for the Kansas City Wizards, Real Salt Lake and Los Angeles Galaxy, winning the MLS Cup and Supporters' Shield with Kansas City in 2000, and the Supporters' Shield with Los Angeles in 2010, his last year as a professional. He was notable for his fitness and resilience to injury, setting an MLS record in 2008 when he made his 118th consecutive first team start. Klein was also a veteran member of the United States national team during the early 2000s; he acquired 23 caps, scored 5 goals, and represented his country at the 2003 Confederations Cup. Career =Amateur= Klein attended De Smet Jesuit High School, and then played three years of college soccer at Indiana University from 1994 to 1997. In total, he started 88 games for the Hoosiers, registering 11 goals and 11 assists as a senior. =Professional= Upon his graduation, Klein was selected fourth overall by the Kansas City Wizards in the 1998 MLS College Draft. He received little playing time as a rookie, starting eight games and substituting into nine, and scored no points. Starting in 1999, however, Klein began to cement a place for himself as one of the league's best midfielders; in the 1999 season, Klein started 24 games for the Wizards, registering six goals and five assists. He started 26 games in 2000, scoring six goals and eight assists, helping the Wizards to an MLS Cup victory. Klein has been an equally important part of the Wizards midfield for the last four years, although his 2004 campaign was cut short by a torn ACL. He came back in 2005 and was named MLS Comeback Player of the Year for the second time in his career, his first coming in 2002. However, before the 2006 season, Klein was traded with an international roster spot to Real Salt Lake for allocation money. On June 21, 2007, Klein was traded to Los Angeles Galaxy for midfielder Nathan Sturgis and forward Robbie Findley. =International= Klein was a fringe player for the United States national team for several years. He received his first cap October 25, 2000 against Mexico, his debut for the men's national team at any age level. He has played in a total of 22 games for the national team, scoring five goals; his best year was 2003, when he played in seven games, and scored three goals. After playing career Klein currently is the President of LA Galaxy. He also serves as an assistant coach for Newport Mesa Soccer Club, which is part of the West Ham International Academy. Personal life Klein is married with three children. He and his wife are evangelical Christians, and Klein is active with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

It is classified as a peri-naphthalene, i.e. a 1,8-disubstituted derivative of naphthalene. Owing to its unusual structure, it exhibits exceptional basicity. It is often referred by the trade name Proton Sponge, a trademark of Sigma-Aldrich. Structure and properties This compound is a diamine in which the two dimethylamino groups are attached on the same side (peri position) of a naphthalene ring. This molecule has several very interesting properties; one is its very high basicity; another is its spectroscopic properties. With a pK of 12.34 for its conjugate acid in aqueous solution, 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene is one of the strongest organic bases. However, it only absorbs protons slowly‚Äîhence the trade name. The high basicity is attributed to the relief of strain upon protonation and/or the strong interaction between the nitrogen lone pairs. Additionally, although many aromatic amines such as aniline show reduced basicity (due to nitrogen being sp¬≤ hybridized; its lone pair occupying a 2p orbital and interacting and being withdrawn by the aromatic ring), this is not possible in this molecule, as the nitrogens' methyl groups prevent its substituents from adopting a planar geometry, as this would require forcing methyl groups from each nitrogen atom into one another - thus the basicity is not reduced by this factor which is found in other molecules. It is sterically hindered, making it a weak nucleophile. Because of this combination of properties, it has been used in organic synthesis as a highly selective non-nucleophilic base.Alexander F. Pozharskii and Valery A. Ozeryanskii \\"Proton sponges and hydrogen transfer phenomena\\" Mendeleev Commun., 2012, 22, 117‚Äì124. Proton sponge also exhibits a very high affinity for boron, and is capable of displacing hydride from borane to form a boronium‚Äìborohydride ion pair. Preparation This compound is commercially available. It may be prepared by the methylation of 1,8-diaminonaphthalene with iodomethane or dimethyl sulfate. Related compounds =Other proton sponges= Second generation proton sponges are known with even higher basicity. 1,8-bis(hexamethyltriaminophosphazenyl)naphthalene or HMPN is prepared from 1,8-diaminonaphthalene by reaction with tris(dimethylamino)bromophosphonium bromide in the presence of triethylamine. HMPN has a pK of 29.9 in acetonitrile which is more than 11 orders of magnitude higher than Proton Sponge. =Hydride sponge= The chemical inverse of a proton sponge would be a hydride sponge. This property is exhibited by CH(BMe), which reacts with potassium hydride to afford K[CH(BMe)H].

Also known as Fire Support Specialist or FISTer, an artillery observer usually accompanies a tank or infantry manoeuvre unit. Spotters ensure that indirect fire hits targets which the troops at the fire support base cannot see. Because artillery is an indirect fire weapon system, the guns are rarely in line-of-sight of their target, often located miles away.US Army, FM 3-09 The observer serves as the eyes of the guns, by sending target locations and if necessary corrections to the fall of shot, usually by radio. More recently a mission controller for an Army Unmanned Air System (UAS) may also perform this function, and some armies use special artillery patrols behind the enemy's forward elements. Broadly, there are two very different approaches to artillery observation. Either the observer has command authority and orders fire, including the type and amount of ammunition to be fired, to batteries. Or the observer requests fire from an artillery headquarters at some level, which decides if fire will be provided, by which batteries, and the type and amount of ammunition to be provided. The first is characterised by the British, the second by the United States. In World War II both Germany and the Soviet Union tended towards the British method. In the US System the observer sends a request for fire, usually to his battalion or battery Fire Direction Center (FDC). The FDC then decides how much fire to permit and may request additional fire from a higher artillery headquarters. FDC(s) convert the observer's target information into firing data for the battery's weapons. In the British system the observer sends a fire order to his own and any other batteries authorised to them, and may request fire from additional batteries. Each battery command post converts the fire orders into firing data for its own guns. Until post-World War II the observer would usually order actual firing data to the guns of his own troop, this was enabled by the use of calibrating sights on the guns. Artillery observers are considered high- priority targets by enemy forces, as they control a great amount of firepower, are within visual range of the enemy, and may be located within enemy territory.  U.S. Army / U.S. Marine Corps  A U.S. Marine artillery forward observer in a tree to get a better view of the battlefield in Guadalcanal, 1942. In the U.S. Army, a Light, Heavy, or Stryker Infantry company Fire Support Team (FIST) consists of a Fire Support Officer (FSO), a Fire Support Sergeant, three Forward Observers (FO), two Fire Support Specialists and three Radio Telephone Operators (RTO). Armored/Cavalry FIST teams usually consist of just one FSO and three enlisted personnel. Brigade COLT teams operate in groups of two individuals, a Fire support specialist in the grade of E-1 to E-4 and a Fire Support Sergeant in the grade of E-5. Currently in unit training is beginning to incorporate more close air support and close combat attack missions into the field artillery team's mission. In the U.S. Marine Corps, scout observers also act as naval gunfire spotters and call for, observe and adjust artillery and naval gunfire support, and coordinate fire support assets to include mortars, rockets, artillery, NSFS and CAS/CIFS. A rifle company Fire Support Team typically consists of a Fire Support Officer (FSO), Forward Air Controller (FAC) or Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), two scout observers (FO), and two radio operators (RO). In Weapons Company, the Fire Support Coordination Center (FSCC) determines fire support asset allocation to each rifle company FiST, and supervises the planning and execution of each FiST's fire support plan. Key players in the FSCC include the Fire Support Coordinator (FSC), Battalion Fire Support Officer (FSO), and Battalion Air Officer (Air-O).  British Forward Observation Officer  Battle of Langemarck, 1917 For centuries the Battery Commander had been responsible for controlling the fire of his battery. This continued with the introduction of indirect fire in the early years of the 20th Century. However, the First World War introduced 24 hour, seven days a week fighting. Furthermore, indirect fire had increased the distance between the guns and their targets, and between the observers and their guns. This led to the use of observing officers to act on behalf of the battery commander. In the 1938 re-organisation of the Royal Artillery batteries were divided into troops, with the troop commanders (Captains) as observing officers at an (OP). These officers and their parties could operate as either as an Observation Post (OP) or accompany the supported arm (infantry or armour) as Forward Observation Officers (FOOs). During World War II it became the practice for close support battery commanders to become part of the tank regiment or infantry battalion headquarters they were supporting. They also started using 'quick fireplans' usually limited to their own regiment, to support fast moving limited battalion actions. Artillery Observer in observation post Generally FOOs were assigned to a company or squadron of a battalion or regiment that their battery was supporting. In the British artillery system FOOs were always authorised to order fire commands to their own troop or battery, based on their assessment of the tactical situation and if necessary liaison with the supported arm commander. From mid World War II some artillery observers were authorised to order fire to all batteries of their regiment, it also became the practice for some observers to be designated 'Commander's Representative' able to order fire to a divisional or corps artillery. Unauthorised officers could request fire from more than their own battery. During that war it also became the practice that FOOs arranged quick fireplans comprising several coordinated targets engaged by guns and mortars to support short offensive actions by the squadron or company they were with. In World War II OP/FOO parties were normally mounted in an armoured carrier, although those assigned to support armoured brigades usually had a tank - initially a Stuart but in NW Europe usually a Sherman. Tanks continued to be used by some observers until about 1975. In 2002 the British Army adopted the term Fire Support Team (FST) for its observation parties, including FACs under control of the artillery officer commanding the FST. = Mortar Fire Controller = A functionally similar title is \\"MFC\\" (Mortar Fire Controller). An MFC is an infantry NCO who is part of his battalion's mortar platoon. He controls platoon's fire in the same way as an FOO. The introduction of FSTs places MFCs under tactical control of the FST commander. Training, enabled by simulators, allows most soldiers to observe artillery fire, which has long been possible via a FOO. Air Observation Post The Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force had been responsible reporting targets and observation of fire in World War I, this role was subsequently called 'Arty/R, but proved difficult from high performance aircraft over hostile territory in World War II. In 1940 it was agreed that RAF AOP squadrons equipped with light aircraft, operating at low altitude over friendly territory and flown by Royal Artillery officers would be formed. These squadrons existed until the formation of the Army Air Corps in 1957.

It is part of the National Highway system spanning Australia, and is signed as National Highway A8. Route description The Dukes Highway starts in Tailem Bend on the Princes Highway and extends southeast to the state border near Bordertown, South Australia. The highway continues in Victoria as the Western Highway, with the same route signage (National A8). The length of the highway in South Australia is around 191 km, joining onto the Western Highway in Victoria which is 443 km. It is a single carriageway of one lane each way, plus a total of 36 overtaking lanes. Approximately has \\"wide centre lines\\" providing a boundary between traffic travelling in opposite directions. Generally, the quality of the Dukes Highway is of a high standard, with the entire road having wide lane widths and sealed shoulders with at least five (and usually six) metres clear beyond the edge line. The final 17 km of the highway after Bordertown, was originally built on unstable ground but was re- constructed in 2005. There are a total of 16 rest areas or parking bays along the Dukes Highway, at approximately 15km intervals. Each one provides sealed parking space for at least four B-double trucks, with bins, tables, shelter and lighting. History The Dukes Highway runs through the northern part of the Limestone Coast region of South Australia. The route and many of the settlements (including Bordertown) were established in the 1850s to supply water to horses for the gold escorts from the Victorian goldfields to Adelaide.From interpretive signs in Bordertown and along the route Gold was taken to Adelaide rather than the closer Melbourne because a higher price was offered there. The higher price was offered to stop the South Australian economy from collapsing as all the labourers were heading to the Victorian Goldfields. The 'Bullion Act' was passed and an Assay office was established in Adelaide for the assaying and stamping of gold in 1852. It is claimed that this saved South Australia from bankruptcy.The Story of Keith 1851-1973, Fry, LPH 1953 In the latter half of the 20th century, the western end of the Dukes Highway was realigned to meet the Mallee Highway closer to Tailem Bend than it had previously when it ran north from Coomandook on the alignment that is now known as the Old Dukes Highway to Moorlands. Major road accidents The Dukes highway is the state's deadliest major road, with 28 deaths in the 5 years to 2009.Dukes Highway rated SA's deadliest, ABC, 20 Jan 2012. This has led to calls for road improvements to separate traffic in each direction. Point-to-point speed cameras have been installed on one section of the highway to identify drivers who flout the speed limit. Parts of the highway have had wider centre lines installed with audio tactile treatment to help drivers to realise and recover from drifting across the centre line before they encounter an oncoming vehicle. This is intended to reduce fatigue and inattention- related crashes. Motorists are advised to rest and recover at the many towns on the Dukes Highway, including Bordertown, Keith, Tintinara, Coonalpyn and Tailem Bend, where the Dukes Highway ends.

Most use focus free lenses or autofocus for focusing, automatic systems for setting the exposure options, and have flash units built in. Point-and-shoots are by far the best selling type of separate camera, as distinct from camera phones. They are popular for vernacular photography by people who do not consider themselves photographers but want easy-to-use cameras for snapshots of vacations, parties, reunions and other events. Point-and-shoot camera sales declined after about 2010 as smartphones overtook them in such uses. To overcome market shrinkage, compact camera manufacturers began making higher end versions and with a stylish metal body. Most superzoom compact cameras have between 30x and 60x optical zoom, although some have even further zoom and weigh less than 300 grams, much less than bridge cameras and DSLRs. Most of these compact cameras use small 1/2.3\\" image sensors, but since 2008, a few non-interchangeable lens compact cameras use a larger sensor such as 1\\" and even APS-C, such as the Fujifilm X100 series, or full frame format such as the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX1 series. They prioritize intelligent Auto, but some high end point-and-shoot cameras have PASM (program, aperture priority, shutter priority, and manual modes) on the mode dial, raw image format, and hot shoe. None have lens mounts.  Compared to SLR  Point-and-shoot cameras are distinguished from single-lens reflex cameras (SLRs) in several respects: point-and-shoot film cameras, and many digital ones, use a viewfinder. The image that the photographer sees is not the same image that passes through the primary lens of the camera. Rather, the image in the viewfinder passes through a separate lens. SLRs, on the other hand, have only one lens, and a mirror diverts the image from the lens into the viewfinder; that mirror then retracts when the picture is taken so that the image can be recorded on the film or sensor. With this mechanism, pictures cannot be previewed on the LCD screens of most digital SLRs (DSLR). Some manufacturers have found a way around this limitation, often by splitting the image into two just before reaching the viewfinder eyepiece. One image goes into the viewfinder and the other goes into a low resolution image sensor to allow light metering or previewing on the LCD, or both. Digital cameras share one advantage of the SLR design, as the camera's display image comes through the lens, not a separate viewfinder. Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Cameras (MILC Cameras) lack a mirror but in many ways can be used the same as DSLRs. Many smaller digital point-and-shoots of the 2010s omit the viewfinder and use only the screen. With SLR cameras, it is important that the image in the viewfinder be the same image recorded by the film or sensor, so that the effect of the add-on lenses and filters can be seen by the photographer. Point-and-shoot cameras generally don't have such add-on devices, hence no need. Small cameras, including digital ones, encourage the occurrence of photographic orbs -- unexpected, typically circular artifacts that occur in flash photography -- where the short distance between the lens and the built- in flash decreases the angle of light reflection to the lens. The resulting retroreflection makes dust particles bright and visible. Camera types Point-and-shoot camera using live preview for a picture in a church in Norway The lowest-end point-and-shoot film cameras are similar to disposable cameras, but can be reloaded. These cameras have focus-free lenses, with fixed apertures. They may or may not have a light meter. Most have a wheel or lever for advancing the film and cocking the shutter, and a crank for returning the film to the canister for unloading. Because of the fixed apertures, models with flash have no way of controlling the exposure from the flash. Therefore, flash pictures have to be taken within a narrow range of distance from the subject. Advanced models use automatic focus and have variable apertures. They all have light meters. They use electric motors to advance and rewind the film. They are much more versatile than the low-end models. They are also likely to have zoom lenses, more advanced auto-focus systems, exposure systems with manual controls, larger apertures and sharper lenses. They may have special lamps or pre-flash systems designed to reduce red eye in flash pictures of people. Compact superzoom cameras or travel zoom cameras have zoom up to 30x, still shorter zoom than current bridge cameras, but more compact than bulky DSLR-shape bridge cameras, and both usually use 1/2.3\\" sensor.  Sales decline  According to the NPD Group, up to end of November 2011 point- and-shoot cameras took 44 percent of photos, down from 52 percent in 2010, while camera-equipped smartphones took 27 percent of photos in 2011, up from 17 percent. Unit total sales of all types of point-and-shoot cameras declined by 17 percent year on year, but increased by 16 percent for cameras having optical zoom greater than 10x. At the end of 2012, more than one brand offered point-and-shoot cameras with 24x optical superzoom as compensation of sales decline and in later years longer zooms became commonplace. Point-and-shoot camera sales dropped by about 40 percent in 2013, particularly for inexpensive cameras. Fujifilm and Olympus stopped development of low-end point-and-shoot cameras and focused on mid and high-end cameras at higher prices. Shipment dropped to 12 million units in 2016, only one-tenth of the peak reached in 2008, the year after Apple introduced its iPhone.  Film types  Most film- based point-and-shoots made after the late 1980s use 35mm film. In the 1980s, 35mm was seen as a \\"professional\\" format due to the relative difficulty of loading and rewinding the film versus cartridge based formats such as 110 or disc film. The key innovations that made 35mm point-and-shoot cameras possible were automatic film loading and automatic advance and rewind. Advanced Photo System film was mildly popular in the 1990s. 126 film was also popular during the 1970s.  Name confusion  The terms \\"point and shoot\\" and \\"compact camera\\" are used differently in different parts of the world. In the UK point- and-shoot predominantly means a fully automatic camera, regardless of size or shape. A \\"compact camera\\" on the other hand, has a small body, regardless of any fully automatic capabilities. Thus a DSLR can have point-and-shoot modes, and some compact cameras are not designed for point and shoot operation, with the equivalent controls to a DSLR. The use of \\"point-and-shoot\\" to mean a small or compact camera regardless of automation capabilities has long been predominant in the US, and in the 21st century it began spreading elsewhere.

The search may involve an official performing an intimate person search and inspecting their personal effects and body cavities (mouth, vagina, anus etc.). A strip search is more intrusive than a frisk and requires legal authority. Regulations covering strip searches vary considerably, and may be mandatory in some situations or discretionary in others. Legality of strip searches In North America, civil lawsuits, as well as criminal code charges against strip searches have usually been successful when a person is strip searched by someone of the opposite sex, especially in cases where a woman has been strip searched by a male guard or guards. The more disputed legal cases have often involved the presence of people of the other gender during a strip search. Some of these cases have been less successful because of the legal technicality of who was actually performing the strip search, i.e. if more than one guard is present, the search is often (legally) said to be being performed by the person or people giving the orders or instructions to the person or people being searched. Another legal issue is that of blanket strip searches, such as in jails where detainees are routinely strip searched prior to conviction of a crime. Courts have often held that blanket strip searches are acceptable only for convicted persons. For detainees pending trial, there must be a reasonable suspicion that the detainee is in possession of weapons or other contraband before a strip search can be conducted. The same often holds true for other situations such as airport security personnel and customs officers, but the dispute often hinges on what constitutes reasonable suspicion. =Incidental strip searches= In order to bypass the legal reasonable suspicion requirement, and because strip searches can be humiliating, the search is often made less overt, as part of an intake process, that includes a mandatory shower. For example, most prisons also include a mandatory shower along with a change of clothes. The shower serves to make the strip search less blatant as well as providing the additional benefit of removing contamination (in addition to removing weapons or other contraband). Many shelters require new arrivals to hand over all their clothing for a wash, as well as requiring them to have a shower. These rules also enable a discreet check for weapons or other contraband, with less legal implications, being less objectionable because the requirement is applied to everyone entering a facility. It is less offensive to clients than requiring them to undergo an overt strip search. Security procedures at facilities that mine and process gold, silver, copper, and other high-value minerals may constitute an incidental strip search. At the end of the workday, miners must remove all work clothes before entering a shower facility and then exit nude through a metal detector to a separate changing room where street clothes are stored. The courts have often held that requiring a person to have a shower as a condition of entry into a space (such as a prison, shelter, or the like) does not, in itself, constitute a strip search, even if the shower and surrounding space are so constructed as to afford visibility of the unclothed body by guards during the showering process. Hospitals often also have a mandatory shower, during lockdown, when mass decontamination is called for. Paul Rega, M.D., FACEP has specifically identified mass decontamination as providing the added benefit of checking for weapons or other contraband, as well as searching for clues among the clothes of persons found at a terrorist attack crime scene where it is recognized that the perpetrator(s) could be among the persons detained for decontamination.Paul Rega, M.D., FACEP, 5/2000, Biological Terrorism Response Manual, \\"The removal of clothing as a decon procedure has the additional advantage of detecting a secondary device concealed on a victim\\" = Children = In 2014 it was reported that more than 4,600 children had been strip-searched by the Metropolitan Police in the preceding five years, with the youngest being ten years old. This was out of a total of 134,000 strip-searched. A charity described the number of younger children searched in this way as being \\"disturbing\\". Procedure of strip searches Partial strip searches are common at airports, for airport security, which often consists of: *removal of shoes (and sometimes socks) *removal of coat and jacket *removal of belt; *untucking of shirt. If there is reason to suspect hidden objects, the person is then taken to a private room, which consists of: *removal of shirt *removal of trousers *removal of underwear and bra Electronic strip searches Backscatter X-ray machines, Millimeter wave scanners, T-ray scans, and other modern technology provide the ability to see through clothing, to achieve a similar result to an actual strip search. Notable lawsuits The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in R. v. Golden (2001) that \\"strip-searches may only be done out of clear necessity with the permission of a supervisor and by members of the same sex.\\" In Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders (2012), the United States Supreme Court ruled that strip-searches are permitted for all arrests, including non- indictable, minor offenses. Four male teenage students were strip searched at Ansonia High School in Ansonia, Connecticut, and sued the two teachers and principal who allegedly violated their rights. The Beard v. Whitmore Lake School District (2005) case arose in Michigan when a student reported that $364 had been stolen from her gym bag during a physical education class. In response to the alleged theft, teachers searched the entire class of 20 boys and five girls in their respective locker rooms. Boys were required to undress down to their underwear. Similarly, girls were required to do so as well in front of each other. The alleged theft was reported to the local police who sent an officer who arrived midway through the search. Based on court records, the officer encouraged school personnel to continue the search. At the conclusion of the search, no money was found. A suit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan on behalf of students impacted by the search claiming Fourth Amendment rights violations against unreasonable search and seizure and the Fourteenth Amendment rights violation involving an equal protection violation. The case was ultimately ruled on by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Sixth Circuit Court focused on several factors that made the strip search unreasonable. One, recovery of money was the primary basis for conducting the search, which did not, in the court's opinion, pose a health or safety threat. Secondly, the search did not involve one or two students but rather a large number of students who did not consent to the search. While the search was held to be unreasonable, the court stopped short of ruling that it was entirely unconstitutional based on prior law involving strip searches of students. Thirdly, school personnel had no reason to suspect any of the students individually. The court emphasized that school leaders have a real interest in maintaining an atmosphere free of theft but a search undertaken to find money serves a less weighty governmental interest than a search undertaken for items that pose a threat to the health and safety of students. Based on the court's position, clearly a search to recover money will not meet the court's expectation regarding the standards associated with a strip search.1 In Safford Unified School District v. Redding (2009), the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for school employees to strip search minor students, in this case students in the Safford, Arizona Unified School District.Safford Unified School District v.

She then sailed via the Panama Canal, to Pearl Harbor, arriving 15 March 1945.

Anglican prayer beads were developed in the latter part of the 20th century within the Episcopal Diocese of Texas and this Anglican devotion has spread to other Christian denominations, including Methodists and the Reformed; as such they are also called Protestant prayer beads. Beads Anglican Prayer Beads Anglican prayer bead sets consist of thirty-three beads divided into groups. There are four groups consisting of seven beads with additional separate and larger beads separating the groups. The number thirty-three signifies the number of years that Christ lived on the Earth, while the number seven signifies wholeness or completion in the faith, the days of creation, and the seasons of the Church year. Groupings The groupings are called \\"weeks\\", in contrast to the Dominican rosary which uses five groups of ten beads called \\"decades\\". The beads between are usually larger than the \\"weeks\\" beads and are called \\"cruciform\\" beads. When the loop of beads is opened into a circular shape, these particular beads form the points of a cross within the circle of the set, hence the term \\"cruciform\\". Next after the cross on Anglican prayer bead sets is a single bead termed the \\"invitatory\\" bead, giving the total of thirty-three. The beads used are made of a variety of materials, such as precious stones, wood, coloured glass, or even dried and painted seeds. Anglican prayer bead sets are made with a variety of crosses or, occasionally, crucifixes. The Celtic cross and the San Damiano cross are two which are often used. Prayer The Anglican Rosary hangs next to a home altar Unlike the Dominican rosary used by Roman Catholics and Anglo-Catholics which focuses on the germane events in the life of Christ and asks the Virgin Mary to pray for their intentions, Anglican prayer beads are most often used as a tactile aid to prayer and as a counting device. The standard Anglican set consists of the following pattern, starting with the cross, followed by the Invitatory Bead, and subsequently, the first Cruciform bead, moving to the right, through the first set of seven beads to the next Cruciform bead, continuing around the circle. He or she may conclude by saying the Lord's Prayer on the invitatory bead or a final prayer on the cross as in the examples below. The entire circle may be done thrice, which signifies the Holy Trinity.

It has two clubhouses: one in London at 89 Pall Mall, and the other in the countryside at Woodcote Park, near Epsom in Surrey, both with accommodation and a range of dining and sporting facilities. The Royal Automobile Club currently admits both men and women as members. History Clubhouse at 89 Pall Mall, London 1901 Mors 10 H.P. rear-entrance tonneau owned by the RAC is a regular contender at the London to Brighton veteran car run; here at Crawley in 2006 It was founded on 10 August 1897 as the Automobile Club of Great Britain (and, later, Ireland). The headquarters was originally in a block of flats at 4 Whitehall Court, moving to 119 Piccadilly in 1902. During 1902 the organisation, together with the recently formed Association of Motor Manufactures and Traders campaigned vigorously for the relaxation of speed limits claiming that the 14 mph speed limit imposed by the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 was 'absurd' and was seldom observed. The organisations, with support from the Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, had considerable influence over the forthcoming Motor Car Act 1903 which originally proposed to remove all speed limits for cars while introducing the offence of driving recklessly. In the face of considerable opposition a speed limit of 20 mph was retained in addition to the creation of the offence of driving recklessly, dangerously or negligently. In 1905, the Club organised the first Tourist Trophy (TT) motorcycle race, the oldest regularly run motor race. The Club became the governing body for motor sport in Britain. King Edward VII's interest in motoring led to the command in 1907 \\"that the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland should henceforth be known as The Royal Automobile Club\\".Royal Automobile Club ‚Äì History In 1911, they moved to the current address, part of the site of the old War Office; the club house was (and remains) one of the largest in London, with a frontage to Pall Mall of 228 feet and a depth, in the centre, of 140 feet. It cost over a quarter of a million pounds and is described in the Survey of London as \\"a polished essay in the late French Renaissance manner\\". At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the Club arranged for twenty-five of their members, with their personal cars, to accompany the British Expeditionary Force to France and Belgium to act as chauffeurs and messengers for the British General Staff. Describing themselves as the \\"RAC Corps of Volunteer Motor Drivers\\", the drivers included the Duke of Westminster, Lord Dalmeny and \\"Toby\\" Rawlinson; many of them were given commissions and went on to give distinguished war service. In September 1914, a further group of RAC members put themselves and their cars at the disposal of the British Red Cross, to help transport war casualties. The RAC was responsible for organising the first British Grand Prix motor race at Brooklands, Surrey in 1926 and also runs its sister organisation, the MSA (formerly RAC MSA). In 1978 during a re-organisation the 'Associate Section' was established as a separate company RAC Motoring Services Ltd, which was owned by the organisation. In 1991 the RAC Foundation was split off as the research arm of 'RAC Motoring Services'. When RAC Motoring Services was sold in 1999 the Foundation was granted a legacy and was subsequently established as a charity to research and promote issues of safety, mobility, economics and the environment related to motoring. In September 1999 members sold RAC Motoring Services to Lex Service plc, who renamed themselves RAC plc in 2002. RAC Plc was then acquired by Aviva plc in March 2005 for around ¬£1.1 billion. RAC History Associate section (RAC Motoring Services) RAC roadside telephone box The RAC introduced uniformed mobile patrols around the roads of Britain during 1901 with the patrolmen wearing a uniform not unlike the military police of the day, including tailored jodhpur trousers. The patrolmen had an army-like rank structure with corporals, sergeants and officers. Mounted on Matchless motorbikes with sidecars containing a tool kit, fanbelts, engine hoses, and metal cans of spare petrol they were usually located on standby at laybys and major road junctions. Until around 1930 control could only contact the mobile patrolmen by telephone, so they waited by public telephone boxes for the callout. From 1957 onwards they were equipped with radio sets for two way contact with their local headquarters. In 1912, following the lead of the competitor organisation The Automobile Association (AA), the RAC installed roadside telephones on laybys and junctions of the main trunk roads in the UK for members to summon help. Although they were never as numerous as AA boxes there was a measure of cooperation between the two motoring clubs‚Äîkeys fitted both types of box and members' messages were passed on. The telephones were installed in locked boxes painted in royal blue with the RAC logo badge mounted on the top of the box. Members were provided with a key to the boxes when they joined the club. Members' cars were identified by a metal club badge usually affixed to the radiator grille and the patrolmen would come to attention and salute as a member drove past, or, if the patrolman was riding a motorcycle, merely salute. This practise was the basis of an unofficial service given by the club to its members; sometimes a patrolman would not salute when driving past, in order to warn the member that they were about to encounter a police speed trap The RAC issued an annual 'Guide and Handbook' that contained road maps of the UK with the location of all RAC telephones marked on it, together with lists of local RAC approved garages and hotels. To give members an indication of the quality of each establishment the RAC was one of the first organisations to provide an easily recognisable grading system. Their inspectors assessed each hotel and garage and awarded between one and five stars in the case of hotels and one to three spanners to garages. The RAC disbanded its hotel inspection team in 2004. Motorcycle patrols gave way to small vans during the 1960s and by 1970 the last motorcycle patrols had been phased out. RAC telephone boxes were withdrawn from service when they were eclipsed by wider telephone ownership and by the 1990s only a handful still operated on holiday routes in the West Country. The advent of mobile phones made the need for roadside telephones redundant and the last of the RAC telephones were removed from service. Roadside assistance is now provided by vans and recovery vehicles. Until the early 1970s the RAC did not have a formal \\"onward to destination\\" service for members. If the patrolman was not able to complete the repair at the roadside, arrangements were made for an RAC approved garage to tow the vehicle and repair it at the owner's cost, with the owners being responsible for making their own arrangements for travel by public transport or hired vehicle. This changed in the 1970s with the first of the low-loading vehicle transporter fleet and the introduction of a higher membership tier of the Recovery service. Similarly, until the early 1980s the roadside assistance service was limited to locations away from home, which only changed with the addition of an At Home level of service. In 1978 the Associate section was split off to form RAC Motoring Services Ltd and subsequently sold in 1999 (then renamed RAC plc).

Background He is recorded as the second son of the 4th king Gaeru and younger brother of the 5th king Chogo.Park, Hyun Sook, ¬´Î∞±Ï†úÏùòÏ§ëÏïôÍ≥ºÏßÄÎ∞©¬ª(Central area and regions of Baekje), p. 71, Juryuseong, 2005, Upon the death of the 6th king Gusu, Gusu's eldest son Saban became king, but proved to be too young to rule. Goi dethroned Saban and became king. The Samguk Sagi records that \\"King Chogo's younger brother, who had the same mother, became king.\\".Samguk Sagi, Scroll 23 This is disputed because of the time differences. It is rather believed that his father was a collateral relative of Gaeru. Some scholars interpret the Korean records Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa to mean that Goi was the younger brother of the mother of King Chogo, implying that he is of the Utae‚ÄìBiryu lineage, rather than a direct descendant of the traditionally recognized founder Onjo. The Chinese records Book of Zhou (Âë®Êõ∏) and Book of Sui (ÈöãÊõ∏) refer to \\"Gutae\\" as the founder of Baekje, and some scholars believe that \\"Gutae\\" actually refers to Goi as the true founder of the kingdom. Reign Goi is generally credited with centralising the Baekje kingdom, concentrating royal power and laying the foundation of the state structure. Immediately upon taking the throne, he established a central military office to restrain the independence of regional clans. The Samguk Sagi also records that in 260, he established a central bureaucracy of six ministers, sixteen rank levels, and a code of dress, although the full system may have been completed after his reign (see, e.g., Best (2002)). In 262, he is said to have established regulations against bribery, requiring corrupt officials to repay three times the amount of the bribe. He also ordered the cultivation of farmlands south of the capital. In 266 the king dispatched soldiers to attack Bongsan Fortress of Silla. The master of the fortress, Jikseon, led a sortie of 200 of his most robust troops and defeated them.Samguk Sagi - scroll 24 He attacked Silla again in 272, 278 and 284.

Foreign relations Under Goi's reign, Baekje expanded control of the Han River region and gained permanent ascendancy over the remaining states of the Mahan, a loose confederacy in the southwest of the Korean Peninsula. He also attacked the borders of Baekje's eastern rival Silla. Baekje also changed its defensive posture against the Chinese to an offensive one. Goi attacked the Chinese-controlled Lelang commandery and the Daifang commandery when the Chinese launched an attack against the Han River region to disrupt and prevent Baekje's emerging power. In 246, according to both the Korean Samguk Sagi and the Chinese Wei Zhi, Baekje went to war against Daifang commandery, and the commandery's governor Gong Zun was slain. In the spring of 286 he sent messengers to Silla to sue for peace and in the winter of that year he died.Samguk Sagi - Scroll 24 Family * Father: Gaeru of Baekje * Mother: unknown ** Brother: Buyeo Chogo (Êâ∂È§òËÇñÂè§, ?‚Äì214) ‚Äì 5th King of Baekje, Chogo of Baekje (disputed by scholars) ** Brother: Buyeo Usu (Êâ∂È§òÂÑ™Â£Ω, ?‚Äì?) ‚Äì the only record of him is in the Samguk Sagi in 260 when he was appointed Minister of the Interior (ÂÖßËá£‰ΩêÂπ≥, Naesin-jwa'pyeong). ** Queens: daughter of the commander of Daifang Commandery, Gongsun Du (ÂÖ¨Â≠´Â∫¶, ?‚Äì204). *** Son: Buyeo Chaekgye (Êâ∂È§òË≤¨Á®Ω, ?‚Äì298) ‚Äì eldest son, 9th King of Baekje, Chaekgye of Baekje.

Naval constructors like William Doughty combined the skills of a naval architect and engineer, at the navy yard his position was somewhat unique, for the naval constructor job provided Doughty with a wide range of connections; most importantly, it meant that he reported to the Board of Navy Commissioners and not to the shipyard commandants like Thomas Tingey and Isaac Hull. The BNC placed such a high value on Doughty's nautical expertise that they scheduled a regular Monday morning meeting to consult with him each week. This relationship with the Navy Commissioners allowed Doughty considerable influence.BNC to Doughty 30 May 1818 NARA RG45 E307 Vol.3. The regard he enjoyed with the shipyard workforce also led to considerable tension as during the strike of 1835, when he advised the ship carpenters to hold out for higher wages.Maloney p. 438 His career as a shipbuilder, though, was long and very successful; the 1850 census for the District of Columbia records his real estate as valued at $35,000.

Many countries outside Britain have prominent gentlemen's clubs, mostly those associated with the British Empire. In particular, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh have enthusiastically taken up the practice, and have a thriving club scene. There are also many extant clubs in major American cities. A gentleman's club typically contains a formal dining room, a bar, a library, a billiards room and one or more parlours for reading, gaming or socializing. Many clubs also contain guest rooms and fitness amenities. Some are associated mainly with sports such as sailing, skiing and mountaineering and maintain regular opportunities for other events such as formal dining. History the Savile Club, 69 Brook Street, London The original clubs were established in the West End of London. Today, the area of St James's is still sometimes called \\"clubland\\". Clubs took over some parts of the role occupied by coffee houses in 18th-century London, and reached the height of their influence in the late 19th century. The first clubs, such as White's, Brooks's and Boodle's, were aristocratic in flavour, and provided an environment for gambling, which was illegal outside of members-only establishments. The 19th century brought an explosion in the popularity of clubs, particularly around the 1880s. At their height, London had over 400 such establishments. This expansion can be explained in part by the large extensions of the franchise in the Reform Acts of 1832, 1867, and 1885. Each time, hundreds of thousands more men were qualified to vote, and it was common for them to feel that they had been elevated to the status of a gentleman, thus they sought a club. The existing clubs, with strict limits on membership numbers and long waiting lists, were generally wary of such newly enfranchised potential members, and so these people began forming their own clubs. Each of the three great Reform Acts corresponded with a further expansion of clubs, as did a further extension of the franchise in 1918. Many of these new, more \\"inclusive\\" clubs proved just as reluctant as their forebears to admit new members when the franchise was further extended. Club Life in London, an 1866 book, begins: \\"The Club in the general acceptation of the term, may be regarded as one of the earliest offshoots of man's habitual gregariousness and social inclination.\\"Cited in the introduction to Women, Clubs and Associations in Britain by Doughan & Gordon, 2006 An increasing number of clubs were characterised by their members' interest in politics, literature, sport, art, automobiles, travel, particular countries, or some other pursuit. In other cases, the connection between the members was membership of the same branch of the armed forces, or the same school or university. Thus the growth of clubs provides an indicator as to what was considered a respectable part of the \\"Establishment\\" at the time. By the late 19th century, any man with a credible claim to the status of \\"gentleman\\" was eventually able to find a club willing to admit him, unless his character was objectionable in some way or he was \\"unclubbable\\" (a word first used by Samuel Johnson).Oxford English Dictionary (probably in 1764). This newly-expanded category of English society came to include professionals who had to earn their income, such as doctors and lawyers. Most gentlemen had only one club, which closely corresponded with the trade or social / political identity he felt most defined him, but a few people belonged to several. Members of the aristocracy and politicians were likely to have several clubs. The record number of memberships is believed to have been with Earl Mountbatten, who had nineteen in the 1960s. A Club of Gentlemen by Joseph Highmore, c. 1730 Public entertainments, such as musical performances and the like, were not a feature of this sort of club. The clubs were, in effect, \\"second homes\\" in the centre of London where men could relax, mix with their friends, play parlour games, get a meal, and in some clubs stay overnight. Expatriates, when staying in England, could use their clubs, as with the East India Club or the Oriental Club, as a base. They allowed upper- and upper- middle-class men with modest incomes to spend their time in grand surroundings. The richer clubs were built by the same architects as the finest country houses of the time, and had similar types of interiors. They were a convenient retreat for men who wished to get away from female relations, \\"in keeping with the separate spheres ideology according to which the man dealt with the public world, whereas women's domain was the home.\\"Introduction to Women, Clubs and Associations in Britain Doughan & Gordon, 2006 Many men spent much of their lives at their club, and it was common for young, newly graduated men who had moved to London for the first time to live at their club for two or three years before they could afford to rent a house or flat. Gentleman's clubs were private places that were designed to allow men to relax and create friendships with other men. In the 19th and 20th centuries, clubs were regarded as a central part of elite men's lives. They provided everything a regular home would have. Clubs were created and designed for a man's domestic needs. They were places to relieve stress and worries. They provided emotional and practical needs. They provided spaces such as dining halls, library, entertainment and game rooms, rooms for sleep, bathrooms and washrooms, and a study. In many ways, they resembled a regular home. Clubs had separate entrances for maids and the help, which were usually located on the side of the building that was not easily seen to the public eye. Many clubs had waiting lists, some as long as sixteen years. There is no standard definition for what is considered a gentlemen's club. Each club differed slightly from another. Clubs were created in a time where family was considered one of the most important aspects of a man's life in the 19th century. A man's home was his property and should have been a place to satisfy most of his needs, but for elite men, this was not always the case; it was not always a place that provided privacy and comfort. An explanation for this might be because the home of elite families often entertained guests for dinners, formal teas, entertainment, and parties. Their lives were on display, and often their lives would be reported in local papers. A gentleman's club offered an escape from this family world. Another explanation would be that men as boys were brought up in all-male environments in places like schools and sports pastimes, and they became uncomfortable when they now had to share their lives with women in a family environment. A gentleman's club offered an escape. Charles Keene Men's clubs were also a scene of gossip. The clubs were designed for communication and the sharing of information with each other. By gossiping, bonds were created which were used to confirm social and gender boundaries. Gossiping helped confirm a man's identity, both in his community and within society at large. It was often used as a tool to climb the social ladder. It revealed that a man had certain information others did not have. It was also a tool used to demonstrate a man's masculinity. It established certain gender roles. Men told stories and joked. The times and places a man told stories, gossiped, and shared information were also considered to show a man's awareness of behaviour and discretion. Clubs were places where men could gossip freely. Gossip was also a tool that led to more practical results in the outside world. There were also rules that governed gossip in the clubs. These rules governed the privacy and secrecy of members. Clubs regulated this form of communication so that it was done in a more acceptable manner. Women also set about establishing their own clubs in the late nineteenth century, such as the Ladies' Institute, and the Ladies' Athenaeum. They proved quite popular at the time, but only one London-based club, The University Women's Club, has survived to this day as a single-sex establishment. Until the 1950s, clubs were also heavily regulated in the rooms open to non-members. Most clubs contained just one room where members could dine and entertain non-members; it was often assumed that one's entire social circle should be within the same club. Harold Macmillan was said to have taken \\"refuge in West End clubs ...: Pratt's, Athenaeum, Buck's, Guards, the Beefsteak, the Turf, [and] the Carlton\\".Mount, Ferdinand, \\"Too Obviously Cleverer\\", review of The Life of Harold Macmillan by D.R. Thorpe and The Macmillan Diaries Vol. II: Prime Minister and After 1957‚Äì66, ed. Peter Catterall, London Review of Books, 8 September 2011 (33:17). Retrieved 8 September 2011. The class requirements relaxed gradually throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. From the 1970s onwards, some single-sex clubs opened to both sexes as guests and as members, partly to maintain membership levels. = Domesticity = Although Gentlemen‚Äôs clubs were originally geared towards a male audience, domestic life played a key role in their establishment and continuity. Defying classic gender norms, the club could be represented as ‚Äúhomosocial domesticity.‚Äù Similar to male coffeehouses of the Ottoman Empire, the clubs were a home away from home. It was an alternate, competing space in the sense that it had similar aspects to that of the traditional home. One of the key lures of these clubs was their private, often exclusive, nature. It was a getaway from the tight, restrictive role expected from the stoic gentlemen. Like the home, men were granted the freedom to perform actions and behaviors not normally conveyed in their ‚Äúpublic-oriented‚Äù lives. With this newfound preference to spend time at clubs, the home lost its status as the base. Members would use this address for official documentation, mailing, and appointments. Meals, formal or informal, were provided and tastes could be catered by the club staff. Spaces within the club were designated for these various functions, and the guest flow could be more easily controlled than at the home. Members‚Äô social status was marked by the prestige of the club, but within, the lines were blurred. Prominent guests could be invited to dinner or to lounge at the club over the house. Staff would monitor these guests and their arrival for the members and, as employees of the member, could personally tailor the experience. Thus, by holding important events at the club, only the wealth and importance of the club and its amenities was displayed instead of their possibly inferior possessions or structures at home. In English clubs, this domesticity was particularly emphasized. These clubs, primarily in London, were usually very ‚Äúquiet‚Äù and its members were well-behaved‚Äîagain pointing to the calm familiarity of the household. In addition, club staff were tasked with keeping the club a private space and attempted to control of the spread of information from the outside. Under no circumstance was the club to be depressing or too involved in the pains of reality. Whether from ‚Äúthe streets, the courts, Parliament, or the Stock Exchange,‚Äù the chaotic nature of work life was put on hold. Young bachelors and other members were in many ways shielded from the true problems of society, especially female ones. While it was definitely an escape, it was not an escape from domesticity. Men knew and enjoyed the matching elements of the home life; it was more of a transfer or alternate reality. Despite the opportunity for mobility within the club, secrecy and exclusivity supported the patriarchal authority. With the absence of female voices and set of rigid institutional structures, members created internal stability. Induction into a club required member approval and payment. Thus, a club was dependent on class and vice versa. Historian Robert Morris proposed that clubs were ‚Äúpart of the power nexus of capitalism, and essential to the continuity of elite dominance of society.‚Äù Current status Membership is by election after the proposers (at least two and in many clubs more), who have known the candidate for a term of years, formally nominate the person for membership. Election is by a special committee (itself elected), which may interview the candidate and which looks at any support and also objections of other members. Some top clubs still maintain distinctions which are often undefined and rarely explained to those who do not satisfy their membership requirements. After reaching the top of a long waiting list, there is a possibility of being blackballed during the process of formal election by the committee. In these circumstances, the principal proposer of such a person may be expected to resign, as he failed to withdraw his undesirable candidate. More often, the member who proposes an unsuitable candidate will be \\"spoken to\\" at a much earlier stage than this, by senior committee members, and he will withdraw his candidate to avoid embarrassment for all concerned. The clubs are owned by their members and not by an individual or corporate body. These kinds of relationships have been analyzed from the network analysis perspective by Maria Zozaya. Today, gentlemen's clubs exist throughout the world, predominantly in Commonwealth countries and the United States. Many clubs offer reciprocal hospitality to other clubs' members when travelling abroad. =United Kingdom= There are perhaps some 25 traditional London gentlemen's clubs of particular note, from The Arts Club to White's. A few estimable clubs (such as the Royal Thames Yacht Club and the Royal Ocean Racing Club) have a specific character that places them outside the mainstream, while other clubs have sacrificed their individuality for the commercial interest of attracting enough members regardless of their common interests. (See article at club for a further discussion of these distinctions.) The oldest gentleman's club in London is White's, which was founded in 1693. Discussion of trade or business is usually not allowed in traditional gentlemen's clubs - although the rooms in clubs are often hired by external organisations for events. Similar clubs exist in other large UK cities, such as New Club in Edinburgh, The St James's Club in Manchester, The Cardiff and County Club in Cardiff, and the Ulster Reform Club in Belfast. The Liverpool Athenaeum was founded in 1797 by art collector and social reformer William Roscoe and friends, and contains a notable library of rare books. The Clifton Club in Bristol was founded in 1818 and occupies an imposing building. St Paul's Club was formed in 1859 in Birmingham, the first in the Midlands. Jersey and Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although outside the UK proper, each have their own The United Club, founded, respectively, in 1848 and in 1870. In London, there are similarities between the original gentlemen's clubs and the more modern but otherwise similarly private members' clubs such the Groucho Club, Soho House and Home House; but those offer memberships by subscription and are owned and run as commercial concerns. All offer similar facilities such as food, drink, comfortable surroundings, venue hire and in many cases accommodation. In recent years the advent of mobile working (using phone and email) has placed pressures on the traditional London clubs which frown on, and often ban, the use of mobiles and discourage laptops, indeed any discussion of business matters or 'work related papers'. A new breed of business-oriented private members' clubs, exemplified by One Alfred Place and Eight in London or the Gild in Barcelona, combines the style, food and drink of a contemporary private members' club with the business facilities of an office. It was for this reason that the Institute of Directors acquired one of the older clubhouses in Pall Mall as more business friendly. Modern day clubs include Blacks and Groucho Club. Several private members clubs for women were established in the late 19th century; among them the Alexandra Club. =United States= The Yale Club of New York City, founded 1897, is the largest gentlemen's club in the world, and now includes women among its members Most major cities in the United States have at least one traditional gentlemen's club, many of which have reciprocal relationships with the older clubs in London, with each other, and with other gentlemen's clubs around the world. Christopher Doob explains in his book Social Inequality and Social Stratification in U.S. Society: ‚ÄúThe most exclusive social clubs are in the oldest cities ‚Äì Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. Others, which are well respected, have developed in such major cities as Pittsburgh, Chicago, and San Francisco. The most exclusive social clubs are two in New York City ‚Äì the Links and the Knickerbocker (Allen 1987,25)‚Äù Doob further explains: ‚ÄúPersonal wealth has never been the sole basis for attaining membership in exclusive clubs. The individual and family must meet the admissions committee‚Äôs standards for values and behavior. Old money prevails over new money as the Rockefeller family experience suggests. John D. Rockefeller, the family founder and the nation‚Äôs first billionaire, joined the Union League Club, a fairly respectable but not top-level club; John D. Rockefeller, Jr., belonged to the University Club, a step up from his father; and finally his son John D. Rockefeller, III, reached the pinnacle with his acceptance into the Knickerbocker Club (Baltzell 1989, 340).‚Äù E. Digby Baltzell explains in his book Philadelphia Gentlemen: The Making of a National Upper Class: ‚ÄúThe circulation of elites in America and the assimilation of new men of power and influence into the upper class takes place primarily through the medium of urban clubdom. Aristocracy of birth is replaced by an aristocracy of ballot. Frederick Lewis Allen showed how this process operated in the case of the nine ‚ÄúLords of Creation‚Äù who were listed in the New York Social Register as of 1905: ‚ÄòThe nine men who were listed [in the Social Register] were recorded as belonging to 9.4 clubs apiece,‚Äô wrote Allen. ‚ÄòThough only two of them, Morgan and Vanderbilt, belonged to the Knickerbocker Club (the citadel of Patrician families) [indeed, both already belonged to old prominent families], Stillman and Harriman joined these two in the membership of the almost equally fashionable Union Club; Baker joined these four in the membership of the Metropolitan Club (Magnificent, but easier of access to new wealth); John D. Rockefeller, William Rockefeller, and Rogers, along with Morgan and Baker were listed as members of the Union League Club (the stronghold of Republican respectability); seven of the group belonged to the New York Yacht Club. Morgan belonged to nineteen clubs in all; Vanderbilt, to fifteen; Harriman, to fourteen.‚Äô Allen then goes on to show how the descendants of these financial giants were assimilated into the upper class: ‚ÄòBy way of footnote, it may be added that although in that year [1905] only two of our ten financiers belonged to the Knickerbocker Club, in 1933 the grandsons of six of them did. The following progress is characteristic: John D. Rockefeller, Union League Club; John D. Rockefeller, Jr., University Club; John D. Rockefeller 3rd, Knickerbocker Club. Thus is the American aristocracy recruited.'‚Äù The oldest existing American clubs date to the 18th century; the five oldest are the South River Club in Annapolis, Maryland (c.1690/1700), the Schuylkill Fishing Company in Andalusia, Pennsylvania (1732), the Old Colony Club in Plymouth, Massachusetts (1769), The Philadelphia Club in Philadelphia (1834), and the Union Club of the City of New York in New York City (1836). The Boston Club of New Orleans, named after Boston (card game) and not the city, is the oldest southern club, founded in 1841 and recently celebrated their 175th Anniversary in 2016. The five oldest existing clubs west of the Mississippi River are the Pacific Club in Honolulu (1851), the Pacific-Union Club (1852), Olympic Club (1860), and Concordia-Argonaut Club (1864), all in San Francisco, and the Arlington Club in Portland, Oregon (1867). Today, gentlemen's clubs in the United States remain more prevalent in older cities, especially those on the East Coast. Only twelve American cities have five or more existing clubs: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Denver, Detroit, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. New York City contains more than any other American city. The Yale Club of New York City, comprising a clubhouse of 22 stories and a worldwide membership of over 11,000, is the largest traditional gentlemen's club in the world. Membership in the Yale Club is restricted to alumni, faculty, and full-time graduate students of Yale University, and the club has included women among its members since 1969.Mooney, James E. (1995). \\"Yale Club\\". In Kenneth T. Jackson. The Encyclopedia of New York City. New Haven, CT & London & New York: Yale University Press & The New-York Historical Society. p. 1280. In the United States, the term \\"gentlemen's club\\" is commonly used to refer euphemistically to strip clubs. As a result, traditional gentlemen's clubs often are referred to as \\"men's clubs\\" or \\"city clubs\\" (as opposed to country clubs) or simply as \\"private social clubs\\" or just \\"private clubs\\". =Canada= Mount Royal Club, Montreal At Montreal, the Beaver Club was founded in 1785. Every year, some of its members travelled back to England to sell their furs, where they established the Canada Club in 1810; it still meets twice yearly as a dining club. The Montreal Hunt Club, founded in 1826, is the oldest extant fox hunting club in North America. The Golden Square Mile is home to several of Montreal's clubs, including the St. James', which was founded in 1857. At the end of the nineteenth century, twenty of its most influential members felt that the St James was becoming 'too overcrowded' and founded the smaller Mount Royal Club in 1899. Overnight it became the city's most prestigious club,The Square Mile, Merchant Princes of Montreal (1987) by Donald MacKay and in 1918, Lord Birkenhead commented that it \\"is one of the best clubs I know in the New World, with the indefinable atmosphere about it of a good London club\\". In 1908 the University Club, affiliated with McGill, opened. The Forest and Stream was formed by Frank Stephen and some of his gentlemen friends and associates on November 27, 1884 at a meeting held at the St. Lawrence Hall in Montreal. The Club‚Äôs original founders were Andrew Allan, James Bryce Allan, Hugh Montagu Allan, Louis Joseph Forget, Hartland St. Claire MacDougall, Hugh Paton, and Frank Stephen. It was formed with 15 shareholders and is still open today. Quebec City has the Literary and Historical Society (1824), the Stadacona Club (1860), and the Garrison Club, founded by officers of the Canadian Militia and opened to the public in 1879. The Toronto Club is the oldest in that city, founded in 1837. Others include The National (1874), The Albany (1882), the York (1909), the University Club, the Faculty Club associated with the University of Toronto, and a number of other clubs. Other Ontario cities have their clubs: The Rideau (1865) at Ottawa; The Hamilton Club (1873); the Frontenac Club (1908) at Kingston, and The Waterloo Club (1913) by letters patent. The Halifax Club was founded in 1862. The Union Club in Saint John, New Brunswick was founded in 1884 through the merger of two earlier clubs, and the Fredericton Garrison Club was founded in 1969 by associate members of the area headquarters officers' mess. The Manitoba Club is Western Canada's oldest club, founded in 1874 at Winnipeg. The Union Club of British Columbia was founded in 1879 in Victoria. The Vancouver Club was founded in 1889. =Australia= Australia has a number of gentlemen's clubs. Of those listed below, the Commonwealth Club, the Brisbane Polo Club, the Kelvin Club, the Newcastle Club, the Royal Automobile Club, the Tattersalls Club in Sydney and the Union, University and Schools Club allow women to enjoy full membership. New South Wales Sydney has the Australian Club, the Royal Automobile Club of Australia, the Tattersalls Club and the Union, University & Schools Club. The City Tattersalls Club, which began as a spin-off from the Tattersalls Club, no longer has exclusive membership criteria. Newcastle has the Newcastle Club. Victoria Melbourne has the Melbourne Club, the Alexandra Club, the Athenaeum Club (named after its counterpart in London), the Australian Club (unrelated to the identically-named club in Sydney), the Kelvin Club and the Savage Club. Geelong has The Geelong Club. Queensland Brisbane has the Queensland Club, the Brisbane Club, the Brisbane Polo Club (housed in the heritage listed Naldham House in the centre of the central business district), United Services Club and the Tattersalls Club (unrelated to the identically-named club in Sydney). South Australia Adelaide has the Adelaide Club and the Naval, Military and Air Force Club of South Australia. Western Australia Perth has the Western Australian Club and the Weld Club. Tasmania Hobart has the Tasmania Club and the Athenaeum Club. Australian Capital Territory Canberra has the Commonwealth Club. =France= The English Club of Pau, France chartered by an Anglo-American winter colony in 1856 is now named the Cercle Anglais. =India= =Bangladesh= * Dhaka Club =Pakistan= Pakistan has inherited most of its gentlemen's clubs from before the partition of India. The clubs were established during the British Raj as a place for the white rulers, and racial segregation was an implicit part of this. For example, the Sind Club, founded in Karachi in 1871, was infamous for a sign hanging outside the door reading \\"Dogs and Locals not allowed\\". The Karachi Gymkhana, also known as the Karachi Club, dates from 1907. At one point the city also supported the Hindu Gymkhana, for the commercial elite, but that 1925 building has been turned to other uses. Modern social clubs like the Karachi Boat Club, Karachi Yacht Club and Pavilion End Club serve as social clubs targeting specific interests. =South Africa= South Africa is home to the Rand Club in downtown Johannesburg, the Wanderers Club in Illovo, Johannesburg as well as the Inanda Club in Sandton and the Johannesburg Country Club. In Cape Town there is the spacious Kelvin Grove Club, the Cape Town Club and the Owl Club. In Durban is the Durban Club, founded in 1852, and the Kimberley Club in Kimberley, founded in 1881. =South America= Lima (Peru) has several traditional gentlemen clubs still in functions such as the Club Nacional (1855), Club de la Uni√≥n (1868), The Phoenix Club (1879), and the Club de la Banca y Comercio (1951). Buenos Aires (Argentina) is home to the Club del Progreso (1852; the oldest gentlemen's club in South America), the Jockey Club (1882) founded by Carlos Pellegrini, and the Club Universitario de Buenos Aires (1918). The Club 20 de Febrero was founded (1858) by General Rudecindo Alvarado in the city of Salta. The name is in honor to the Battle of Salta on 20 February 1813, during the Argentine War of Independence. Santiago (Chile) houses the Club de la Uni√≥n (1854), originally a rich men's only club. Vi√±a del Mar has the Club de Vi√±a del Mar (1901). =Sweden= Clubs in Sweden include S√§llskapet ('The Society') (1800), the military club Milit√§rs√§llskapet (1852), Nya S√§llskapet ('The New Society') (1874) in Stockholm and the Royal Bachelors' Club (1769) in Gothenburg =New Zealand= There are active gentlemen's clubs in Nelson (Hope), Auckland, Hastings, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. = Japan = The Kasumi Kaikan is Japan's club of the former kazoku nobility with strict membership rules. Although it has many characteristics of a gentlemen's club, membership is open to women as well. =Hong Kong= The Hong Kong Club. =Thailand= The most prestigious active gentlemen's club in Thailand is the Royal Bangkok Sports Club, one of the oldest sporting institutions in Thailand, with construction personally funded by King Rama V Quirks of membership While many clubs have requirements of entry, often including financial requirements or collegiate affiliations ‚Äì The Yale Club and Penn Club of New York City are typical of university clubs: they are open to all who have a connection with their respective universities (in this case Yale University or the University of Pennsylvania) ‚Äì some clubs have highly specific membership requirements. The Caledonian Club in London requires \\"being of direct Scottish descent, that is to say, tracing descent from a Scottish father or mother, grandfather or grandmother\\" or \\"having, in the opinion of the Committee, the closest association with Scotland.\\" The Travellers Club, from its foundation in 1819, has excluded from membership anyone who has not met a very specific travelling requirement. Rule 6 of the club's constitution states that \\"no person be considered eligible to the Travellers' Club, who shall not have travelled out of the British islands to a distance of at least 500 miles from London in a direct line\\". The Reform Club requires its potential members to attest that they would have supported the 1832 Reform Act, whilst certain members of the East India Club must have attended one of its affiliated public schools. Clubs also require membership fees, which, along with the ongoing cost of meeting their dress codes and the cost of bar tabs and dining bills, tends to impose a financial barrier for existing and would-be members. Most clubs have favourable subscription fees for younger members.

The name derives from the name \\"smart drugs\\", a class of drugs and food supplements intended to affect cognitive enhancements which are often sold in smart shops. The rise of anonymous smart shops Some governments do not tolerate smart shops in any form as a part of their crime prevention. For example, the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden with its zero tolerance drug policy, does not accept physical smart shops and has shut down every known Swedish online smart shop that have been selling pure research chemicals on the visible Web. To circumvent this the usage of anonymous marketplaces through the Tor network has taken over since the establishment of Silk Road, which in contrast took the FBI two and a half years to take down for one month. Saturday, 30 March 2019 Typical products specialization A Dutch Smart Shop with herb grinders on display =Smart drugs= Smart shops (often webshops) offer prescription-free pharmacy products such as Ritalin, Adderall, and modafinil, for example.https://www.vice.com/read/nootropics-smart-drugs =Psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants= Traditional entheogens Smart shops are best known in practice for selling whatever psychedelics, dissociatives, entactogens and deliriants local law permits. In the Netherlands, which is home to most of the smart shops in Europe, this includes Salvia divinorum, Amanita muscaria, Peyote, San Pedro cactus, Tabernanthe iboga, and various ingredients for Ayahuasca preparations. As of 1 December 2008, magic mushrooms are under stricter control in the Netherlands. Those new controls are quite controversial, because the list of banned mushrooms also contains species that have no psychoactive substances. Magic Mushroom spore prints and grow boxes are still available over the counter in the Netherlands. Psilocybin is not included in the ban and continues to be sold in smart shops nationwide in truffle form. The decline of designer drugs Smart shops in various countries have been known in the past to sell designer drugs: that is, synthetic substances that were not (yet) illegal. The sale of synthetic drugs not explicitly approved as food, supplements or medicines is illegal in some of them. For example, in the Netherlands it is dealt with by the relatively benign machinery of the Warenautoriteit (Commodities Authority) rather than in criminal law, as would be the case with controlled substances. Yet, this has made it effectively impossible to sell them in a formal retail setting, even if their production and possession is entirely legitimate. Smart shops have attempted no further marketing of synthetics since they tried to sell methylone as a \\"room odorizer\\" but were ultimately forced to pull it from their shelves in 2004, though it can still be obtained under the counter in some shops. =Drug paraphernalia= Smart shops sell many products that can be seen as complement goods to psychoactive drugs, including illegal ones. In the Netherlands, which has no drug paraphernalia laws, this is entirely legal. In particular, the sales of literature about illegal drugs or their manufacture is rarely criticized and protected by a traditional concern for free speech in local law and custom that is more pronounced than in other European nations. Many of the paraphernalia and complements sold in smart shops reduce, in one way or another, the harm associated with illegal drugs. For instance, reagent kits for testing the purity of ecstasy can be essential now that tablets named ecstasy can in practice contain just about anything, and often do not, in fact, contain MDMA at all. Supplements of vitamins and amino acids have been developed to mitigate specifically the damage of certain illegal drugs. Tryptophan and 5-hydroxy-tryptophan, for instance, can be used to help the body replenish serotonin levels in the brain after the use of MDMA, and vitamin supplements are appropriate for users of stimulants such as amphetamine. Vitamin B12 is depleted by recreational use of nitrous oxide, and is thereby useful. Smart shop is distinguished from head shops found in many countries. Head shops provide only paraphernalia, whereas smart shops usually sell at least some actual drugs. The term head shop is more common in the UK, though many British head shops sold magic mushrooms until July 2005 when the Government introduced a complete ban on magic mushrooms, putting them in the same category as heroin and crack cocaine. Many of the British head shops still sell a range of other legal highs. Education and information Smart shops have become a natural source of information about the drugs they sell. They commonly provide instruction leaflets similar to the package inserts distributed with prescription drugs, which contain information on contra- indications, side effects, and the importance of set and setting. In the Netherlands, there is relatively little formal regulation of the smart shop industry, but the natural concentration of expertise about a relatively exotic range of products in combination with the realization that closer public scrutiny and regulation are always lurking in the background have caused the smart shops to organize into an industry association that, among other things, promotes the spread of information about its wares. Legality =The Netherlands= Legally, smart shops operate under a decision of the Hoge Raad (Supreme Court) that has declared that unprepared mushrooms and cacti are not considered \\"preparations\\" of the substances they contain, and are therefore not banned under the Opium Act or international law even if their active ingredients are. There are some shops from the Netherlands that operate as both a smart shop and a head shop on an international level. Customers are expected to accept the responsibility to inform themselves about the local laws, import and custom regulations before ordering and to certify that the import to their country of the products ordered is legal. As of December 1, 2008, the sale of magic mushrooms was subject to tighter control in the Netherlands. This legal regime is markedly different from the one that applies to cannabis products. Those are formally illegal under the Opium Act and international law, which explicitly bans the plant rather than the cannabinoids in it. Cannabis products such as marijuana and hashish can be sold and possessed only pursuant to a web of executive orders more-or-less silently assented to by parliament. The sale of magic mushrooms, on the other hand, was entirely legal and subject only to the common regulation of foodstuffs by the Warenautoriteit (Commodities Authority). =Republic of Ireland= In the Republic of Ireland, there was a sharp rise in Smart shops around the Celtic Tiger era, however, given new government legislations against psychoactive substances, Smart shops that do still operate in the Republic Of Ireland have become shops for paraphernalia and growing equipment, more comparable to a Head Shop. =UK= As with UK based head shops, both paraphernalia and \\"legal highs\\" are available from these stores, such as Salvia Divinorum based products designed to simulate illegal drug highs such as those experienced through the use of amphetamine [speed], methamphetamine, and psychedelics [psilocybin]. Magic mushrooms were available until the government closed a loophole, effectively banning the sale of raw or prepared magic mushrooms in January 2006. Since the passing of the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, the sale of any chemical substance which alters or affects mental functioning in any way is illegal. This has effectively rendered the term \\"smartshop\\" obsolete in the UK. =Portugal= In Portugal, prior to March 2013, the drug laws were very liberal, and several smartshops were opened. A chain store, called Magic Mushroom, emerged as the market leader. Shops in Portugal still sell all type of herbal incense and plant feeders. In March 2013, the Portuguese Government enacted a law making it illegal to sell psychoactive drugs, thus ending the smartshop business in the country.Governo encerra smartshops - Expresso.pt See also * October 2010 raid on smart shops in Poland * Drug policy of the Netherlands * Coffeeshop References Category:Drug culture Category:Drug paraphernalia Category:Slang pl:Dopalacze ","title":"Smart shop"},{"id":"1140868","text":"TCG Dumlupƒ±nar may refer to a number of submarines operated by the Turkish Naval Forces: * , an Italian Monfalcone-class submarine, in operation from 1931 to 1949. * , a given to Turkey by the US in 1950.

There are seven recognised breeds of Shamo chicken in Japan, all of which are designated Natural Monuments of Japan. The Shamo breeds are thought to derive from fighting chickens of Malay type brought from Thailand in the early part of the seventeenth century.  History  The name \\"Shamo\\" was a corruption of the word \\"Siam\\", which means \\"Thailand\\", during the early Edo period. Even though the breed was originally from Thailand, it has been selectively bred for several hundred years and is very different from the original stock. The breed is used in naked-heeled cockfighting in Japan, where it is still legal. It is also bred all over the world for its show quality and unique upright posture. O-Shamo and Chu-Shamo are designations for different weight categories of large fowl, whereas the Nankin-Shamo is a bantam chicken. The Ko Shamo („Ç∑„É£„É¢), unlike O-Shamo and Chu-Shamo, is merely an ornamental breed not used for cockfighting, although it is bred to be temperamental and show the spirit of a fighter. While it is not related to the other breeds, it is often assumed to be because of the similarity of their names.  Breeds  The seven recognised Shamo breeds designated as Natural Monuments of Japan are: * Ehigo-Nankin- Shamo * O-Shamo (large Shamo, Â§ßËªçÈ∂è) * Kinpa * Ko-Shamo (small Shamo, Â∞èËªçÈ∂è) * Nankin-Shamo (Nankin Shamo, Âçó‰∫¨ËªçÈ∂è) * Yakido or Ygido (ÂÖ´Êú®Êà∏È∂è) * Yamato-Shamo or Yamato Gunkei Other Shamo variants are the Chu-Shamo (medium Shamo, ‰∏≠ËªçÈ∂è) and the Chibi Shamo.

The Entente Europ√©enne recognises the Shamo, Ko-Shamo, Yakido and Yamato Gunkei, and lists the Chu-Shamo and Nankin Shamo as unrecognised. The Australian Poultry Standards have only one form of Shamo, which has a minimum weight of 3 kg. The American Poultry Association recognises the Shamo as a breed, both full-sized and bantam.

The Antigonish Movement later evolved into the Extension Department (now the Coady International Center) of St. Francis Xavier University. Father Tompkins believed in the emancipating power of education and sought to improve economic conditions through study groups and co-operative action. \\"It is not enough to have ideas, we have to put legs on them\\", he often said. He started the first regional library in Nova Scotia along with the first credit union and a cooperative housing association in Reserve Mines that was dubbed \\"Tompkinsville\\". Father Tompkins was the Spiritual founder of the Antigonish Movement. Brief biography Jimmy Tompkins was born in Margaree Forks, Nova Scotia, a small farming community on Cape Breton Island. From 1888-1895, he attended St. Francis Xavier University in alternate semesters while teaching Greek and Mathematics to support himself. He attended the Urban College of the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide (Papal Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith) in Rome from 1897 to 1902. On his return, he continued teaching at St. Francis Xavier University and became the vice-rector in 1907. Working closely with the Carnegie Corporation, he implemented various reform and modernization programs, culminating in an unsuccessful attempt to amalgamate various sectarian and non-sectarian colleges in the Maritime Provinces into one nondenominational university centered around Dalhousie University in Halifax. Although the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Halifax Edward McCarthy supported amalgamation, the Catholic Bishop of Antigonish James Morrison successfully opposed it and eventually exiled Tompkins to the tiny fishing village of Canso, Nova Scotia as parish priest for Canso, Little Dover and Queensport. As parish priest Tompkins observed firsthand the plight of the poor fishing community there and helped organize and lead what would become the Antigonish Movement of cooperative fisheries, stores, housing projects, and adult study groups. The Antigonish Movement was eventually institutionalized in the form of the Extension Department at St. Francis Xavier, which was headed by Tompkins' double-cousin Father Moses Coady and which included Father Hugh MacPherson, A.B. MacDonald and others.

A foam party is a social event at which participants dance to music on a dance floor covered in several feet of suds or bubbles, dispensed from a foam machine.  History  Foam parties can be dated back to A Rhapsody in Black and Blue, a 1932 short film directed by Aubrey Scotto, wherein Louis Armstrong dances, sings, and plays his trumpet in a large area of soap suds. Songs performed in the foam are \\"I'll Be Glad When You're Dead, You Rascal You\\" and \\"Shine\\". Another film featuring foam parties is The Party, featuring Peter Sellers. Modern foam parties were developed in the early 1990s by club promoters in Ibiza. Generally, machines were large, ceiling mounted foam generators, created by Weird Dream Productions, that created a large volume of foam that fell from the ceiling onto clubbers. The large water usage and subsequent cleanup required made this impractical for many venues., resulting in a demand upon Weird Dream Productions to modify their machines to be of low water content. Weird Dreams achieved this in model Mk III which produced 200,000 litres per minute with just 50l of water. UK style leaders Big Fun and Roy Barlow Leisure purchased machines from Weird Dream Productions and later began manufacturing their own versions, creating a global market for the product, which the 3 companies remained global market leaders throughout the craze. All market leaders were UK based until around 2004. As Ibiza foam parties became more popular, the craze spread, and the foam cannon was developed by Roy Barlow from The Entertainment Biz and Robin Wincup from Galaxy. In the 1990s, the foam parties were performed weekly at Amnesia in Ibiza.  Safety  There are numerous hazards associated with foam parties. In 2008, three people were electrocuted and two others injured at a foam party at the Venezia Palace Hotel in Antalya, Turkey.

Rigali previously served as the Committee for Pro-Life Activities chairman of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.http://www.lifenews.com/2011/06/03/pro-abortion-catholic-vice- president-joe-biden-meets-with-pope/ \\"Pro-Abortion \\"Catholic\\" Vice President Joe Biden Meets with Pope\\" Early life and education The youngest of seven children, Justin Rigali was born in Los Angeles, California, to Henry Alphonsus and Frances Irene (n√©e White) Rigali. Two of his siblings entered the religious life as well; his sister Charlotte joined the Sisters of St. Joseph, and his brother Norbert the Jesuits. Rigali attended Holy Cross School before entering the preparatory seminary in Hancock Park in 1949. He studied philosophy and theology at Los Angeles College, Our Lady Queen of Angels Seminary in San Fernando and St. John's Seminary in Camarillo. He was ordained to the priesthood by James Francis Cardinal McIntyre on April 25, 1961, and then did pastoral work in Los Angeles and Downey. In 1961, Rigali earned a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree from the Catholic University of America, where he is now a member of the Board of Trustees. In October of that year, he entered the graduate division of the Pontifical North American College in Rome, later obtaining a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1964. He was also an assistant during the first two sessions (1962‚Äì1963) of the Second Vatican Council. Rigali briefly returned to the United States in the summer of 1964, during which time he served as an associate pastor in Pomona. Returning to Rome, he then studied at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy from 1964 to 1966 in preparation for his diplomatic work for the Vatican. Priestly ministry Rigali began his service in the English section of the Secretariat of State on November 25, 1964. From September 1966 to February 1970, he was secretary of the Apostolic Nunciature to Madagascar, which also served as the apostolic delegation for the islands of R√©union and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. He was named a Papal Chamberlain on July 11, 1967. On February 11, 1970, Rigali became director of the English section of the Secretariat of State and the English translator to Pope Paul VI, whom Rigali subsequently accompanied on several international trips. During his service at the Secretariat of State, Rigali was also a chaplain at a Carmelite monastery and a professor at his alma mater of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. He accompanied Pope John Paul II on a number of international pastoral visits, including his first two journeys to the United States in 1979 (which included a trip to Rigali's future see of Philadelphia) and 1987. He was made a Prelate of Honor of His Holiness on April 19, 1980, and a magistral chaplain in the Order of the Knights of Malta on October 25, 1984. Episcopal career On June 8, 1985, Rigali was appointed President of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy and Titular Archbishop of Volsinium by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 14 from John Paul, with Cardinals Eduardo Mart√≠nez Somalo and Achille Silvestrini as co-consecrators, in the cathedral of Albano. He selected as his episcopal motto: Verbum Caro Factum Est, meaning, \\"The Word Became Flesh\\" (). He became a member of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre on October 13, 1986. From 1985 to 1990, in addition to his role of president of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, Rigali held a number of positions within the Roman Curia, serving in the Secretariat of State, Council for the Public Affairs of the Church, Congregation for Bishops, and Pontifical Council for the Laity. He was named Secretary of the Congregation for Bishops by John Paul II on December 21, 1989; as Secretary, he served as the second-highest official of that dicastery. Rigali was later made Secretary of the College of Cardinals by John Paul II on January 2, 1990, and served on the Permanent Interdicasterial Commission, Pontifical Commission for Latin America, and Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. During the same time, he was also engaged in pastoral service to a number of parishes and seminaries in Rome. =Archbishop of St. Louis= On January 25, 1994, Pope John Paul II named Rigali the seventh Archbishop of St. Louis, Missouri. Succeeding Archbishop John L. May, he was formally installed by Bernardin Cardinal Gantin, then the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Bishops, on March 15 of that same year. The newly installed archbishop became a member of the Knights of Columbus on November 7, 1994. During his tenure at St. Louis, known as the \\"Rome of the West\\", Archbishop Rigali showed a great interest in schools, visiting every high school in the archdiocese. However, Rigali opposed collective bargaining by teachers, and opposed any efforts they made to organize. Rigali was widely credited as an able administrator and effective fundraiser, although his popularity dimmed as his tenure continued. In January 1999, Rigali hosted the pastoral visit of John Paul to St. Louis, the only such papal visit (not counting the even briefer stopovers John Paul made in Alaska on trips to other countries) to a single diocese in the United States during the pontificate. John Paul reportedly decided to be hosted by the Archdiocese of St. Louis because of his longtime close friendship with Rigali, from Rigali's days working under him in Rome as a bishop. According to the St. Louis Business Journal, during his tenure as Archbishop of St. Louis, Rigali \\"brought financial stability to the St. Louis Archdiocese, overseeing successful capital campaigns to address immediate needs and raising endowment funds for the future.\\"http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2000/01/31/focus75.html =Archbishop of Philadelphia= Rigali was later appointed the eighth Archbishop of Philadelphia by Pope John Paul II toward the end of his pontificate on July 15, 2003, replacing the retiring Anthony Bevilacqua. Prior to Rigali's installation in Philadelphia on October 7, 2003, it was announced on September 28 that he would be elevated to the College of Cardinals, a customary privilege for the archbishops of Philadelphia. Rigali was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prisca in the consistory of October 21, 2003. Rigali was the only American cardinal to serve as a concelebrant at the 2005 funeral mass for John Paul II. He was also one of the cardinal electors who participated in the ensuing papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XVI, as well as the following conclave, which selected Pope Francis. Rigali remained eligible to vote in conclaves until he reached 80 on April 19, 2015. In September 2007, the cardinal was named by Benedict as a member of the Congregation for Bishops, the curia department that puts forward to the Pope the names of those considered to be appropriate choices to be appointed as bishops. =Apostolic Administrator of Scranton= On August 31, 2009, Rigali became the Apostolic Administrator (sede vacante) to the Diocese of Scranton following the Pope's acceptance of the resignations of Bishop Joseph Martino and Bishop John Dougherty, Auxiliary Bishop of Scranton. Rigali served eight months as the Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Scranton. His delegate was Joseph Bambera, who became the tenth Bishop of Scranton on April 26, 2010, bringing Rigali's administration of Scranton to an end. =Between Scranton administration and retirement= On June 16, 2011, Rigali was appointed the Pope's special envoy to the celebrations at Prachatice in the Czech Republic for the 200th anniversary of the birth of Saint John Neumann, the fourth Bishop of Philadelphia and thus Rigali's predecessor. Neumann, the second American citizen to be canonized (after Frances Xavier Cabrini), was born in Prachatice, came to the United States and was ordained there in 1836, and in 1848 became a naturalized United States citizen. On July 19, 2011, Pope Benedict named Denver Archbishop Charles J. Chaput to succeed Rigali in Philadelphia. Rigali's retirement occurred amid scandal, and specifically \\"amid an uproar over grand jury allegations that he was keeping about three dozen suspected abusers in ministry.\\" Rigali initially had stated that \\"there were no priests in active ministry who had been accused of abuse\\" before reversing course and suspending 21 priests in a single day, \\"prompting criticism that he should have alerted prosecutors sooner.\\" Archbishop Chaput was installed on September 8, 2011. =Retirement= After the installation of Chaput in Philadelphia, Rigali retired in residence with the Diocese of Knoxville, Tennessee at the invitation of Bishop Richard Stika, who had been vicar general and chancellor of the Archdiocese of St. Louis when Rigali was archbishop there. He has been active in the diocese during his residence there.https://dioknox.org/leadership/office-of-cardinal- rigali/https://dioknox.org/tag/cardinal-justin-rigali/ In December 2013, when Pope Francis overhauled the membership of the Congregation for Bishops, Rigali, then 78, retired and was not reappointed. At least since November 2015, Rigali has also participated in some activities in the Diocese of Nashville.http://dioceseofnashville.com/search?query=Rigali =Controversies over handling of sexual abuse scandals= As Rigali retired, The New York Times ran an article with the headline \\"In Philadelphia, a Changing of the Guard in the Shadow of Scandal\\"; the article referred to \\"the cloud that hangs over Cardinal Rigali's legacy ‚Äì his mishandling of the abuse scandal.\\" In September 2015, the group Catholic Whistleblowers, an organization of priests, nuns and canon lawyers who advocate on behalf of victims of clergy sex abuse, petitioned Pope Francis, shortly before his visit to the United States, to investigate Rigali's treatment of child sex abuse victims and families, along with the record of Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke. In 2007, a former Catholic high school student called a church sexual abuse hotline to report that he had been repeatedly molested by Michael J. Bransfield--then a teacher at Lansdale Catholic High School in Pennsylvania--in the 1970s, decades before Bransfield had risen to become Bishop of Wheeling-Charleston, West Virginia.'They looked the other way': Sexual abuse claim dismissed by church foreshadowed years of allegations against Catholic bishop, Washington Post (November 29, 2019). Rigali, as archbishop of Philadelphia, handled the complaint, and in October 2009, Rigali declared the allegations to be unsubstantiated and took no action against Bransfield. At the time, Bransfield maintained friendly relations with members of the Church hierarchy in Philadelphia, giving Rigali a gift of $1,000 in 2011 and other cash gifts to other senior clerics of the Philadelphia archdiocese, including Monsignor Timothy C. Senior, the vicar for clergy. Bransfield was later forced out as bishop of Wheeling-Charleston in 2018, as he came under scrutiny for a series of allegations of sexual abuse and financial impropriety throughout his tenure. Bransfield's accuser said that Rigali and other officials \\"looked the other way\\" and failed to inform him about the church's handling of his complaint. Views =Gay marriage= In June 2006, Rigali traveled to the White House along with Archbishop John J. Myers of Newark and Cardinal Se√°n Patrick O'Malley of Boston to attend a press conference by US President George W. Bush to support a constitutional amendment initiative in the United States Senate banning gay unions or marriages. =Abortion= As chairman of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Pro-Life Committee, he remarked during the annual Washington, DC, pro-life rally in January 2007 that \\"there are reasons for rejoicing\\" in the pro-life cause: the growing participation by young people and a heightened awareness of the issue's intense and growing moral sensitivity among them, who will eventually have a contribution to make to societal issues. He has publicly endorsed the Pregnant Women Support Act, which he praised for offering \\"an authentic common ground\\" that \\"will proved many kinds of life-affirming support for pregnant women and their unborn children.\\" =Conscience rights= In November 2009, Rigali, with several other Roman Catholic prelates, signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration, which stated: > Because the sanctity of human life, the dignity of marriage as a union of > husband and wife and the freedom of conscience and religion are foundational > principles of justice and the common good, we are compelled by our Christian > faith to speak and act in their defense. In this declaration we affirm: (1) > the profound, inherent, and equal dignity of every human being as a creature > fashioned in the very image of God, possessing inherent rights of equal > dignity and life; (2) marriage as a conjugal union of man and woman, > ordained by God from the creation, and historically understood by believers > and non-believers alike, to be the most basic institution in society and; > (3) religious liberty, which is grounded in the character of God, the > example of Christ, and the inherent freedom and dignity of human beings > created in the divine image ... We are Christians who have joined together > across historic lines of ecclesial differences to affirm our right‚Äîand, more > importantly, to embrace our obligation‚Äîto speak and act in defense of these > truths. We pledge to each other, and to our fellow believers, that no power > on earth, be it cultural or political, will intimidate us into silence or > acquiescence ... Through the centuries, Christianity has taught that civil > disobedience is not only permitted, but sometimes required. There is no more > eloquent defense of the rights and duties of religious conscience than the > one offered by Martin Luther King, Jr., in his Letter from a Birmingham > Jail. Writing from an explicitly Christian perspective, and citing Christian > writers such as Augustine [of Hippo] and [Thomas] Aquinas, King taught that > just laws elevate and ennoble human beings because they are rooted in the > moral law whose ultimate source is God Himself. =Stem cell research= In March 2009, he described President Barack Obama's lifting of George W. Bush's restrictions on embryonic stem cell research as \\"a sad victory of politics over science and ethics.\\" =Ordination of women= In April 2009, he denounced the ordination ceremony of two women in Roxborough, calling it a \\"pseudo-ordination\\" that \\"denigrates the truth entrusted to the Church by Christ himself.\\" =Communications= He has a weekly series of Lenten discourses on YouTube. In the beginning of 2010 an official Facebook page was launched for Rigali. Charity work He is an honorary council member of the St. Louis, Missouri‚Äìbased humanitarian organization Wings of Hope.

Debret won the second prize at the 1798 Salon des Beaux Arts. Biography First remittance of the L√©gion d'Honneur, 15 July 1804, at Saint-Louis des Invalides, by Jean-Baptiste Debret, 1812. Debret studied at the French Academy of Fine Arts, a pupil of the great Jacques-Louis David (1748‚Äì1825) to whom he was related. He accompanied David to Rome in the 1780s. His debut was at the Salon des Beaux Arts of 1798, where he got the second prize. He travelled to Brazil in March 1816 as a member of the so-called French Artistic Mission, a group of bonapartist French artists and artisans bound to creating an arts and crafts lyceum in Rio de Janeiro (Escola Real de Artes e Of√≠cios) under the auspices of King D. Jo√£o VI and the Conde da Barca. The lyceum later became the Academia Imperial de Belas Artes (Imperial Academy of Fine Arts) under Emperor Dom Pedro I. Guaran√≠ family captured by slave hunters. As a painter favored first by the Portuguese court in exile and later by the imperial court in Rio, Debret was often commissioned to paint portraits of many of its members, such as Portuguese king Dom Jo√£o VI and the Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria, the first empress of Brazil, who married D. Pedro I (Debret was commissioned to produce a painting of her arrival for the marriage at the Rio port, as well as the public acclaiming of the new Emperor). He established his atelier at the Imperial Academy in December 1822 and became a valued teacher in 1826. In 1829 Debret organized the first arts exhibition ever to take place in Brazil, in which he presented many of his works as well as of his disciples. Emulating David's role during the French Empire, Debret was also involved in the drawing ornaments for many of public ceremonies and official festivities of the court and even some of the courtier's uniforms are credited to him. He corresponded frequently with his brother in Paris. Noticing After his brother's interest in his depiction of everyday life in Brazil, he started to sketch street scenes, local costumes and relations of the Brazilians in the period between 1816 and 1831. He took a particular interest in slavery of blacks and in the indigenous peoples in Brazil. Together with the German painter Johann Moritz Rugendas (1802‚Äì1858), his work is one of the most important graphic documentation of life in Brazil during the early decades of the 19th century. Debret returned to France in 1831 and became a member of the Academie des Beaux Arts. From 1834 to 1839 he published his monumental series of three volumes of engravings, titled Voyage Pittoresque et Historique au Br√©sil, ou S√©jour d'un Artiste Fran√ßais au Br√©sil (\\"A Picturesque and Historic Voyage to Brazil, or the Sojourn of a French Artist in Brazil\\"). Unfortunately the work was not a commercial success. In order to survive, he made lithographs depicting paintings by his distant cousin David, but the editions were very limited and money was short. Debret died poor in Paris in 1848.

Its principal purpose is training for the ordination of ministers, but is also used more widely for training within the denomination. History Agnes Smith Lewis, benefactor Margaret Dunlop Gibson, benefactor The college was founded in London in 1844 with a temporary home in the Exeter Hall before moving to permanent premises in Queen's Square, London in 1859. It then moved to Cambridge in 1899 following the gift of a prime site of land near the centre of the city by two Scottish sisters, Agnes Smith Lewis and Margaret Dunlop Gibson, both noted biblical scholars. Following an appeal for funds from the wider Presbyterian congregation, the college commissioned a new building designed by Henry Hare and built between 1897-1899\\\\. In 1967 the college began to amalgamate with Cheshunt College, Cambridge, presaging the union of the Congregational and Presbyterian churches to form the United Reformed Church in 1972. =Lewis and Gibson= Agnes Smith Lewis and Margaret Dunlop Gibson were noted for their study of one of the earliest versions of the Old Gospels in Syriac Sinaiticus discovered in Saint Catherine's Monastery on the Sinai Peninsula. The other important contributions to the field of Aramaic and Theology are the publications of the Codex Climaci Rescriptus, a 6th-century palimpsest written in Christian Palestinian Aramaic which contains portions of the Old Testament and New Testament, at the Leuven Database of Ancient Books and another palimpsest manuscript of the Forty Martyrs of the Sinai desert and the Story of Eulogios, the Stone Cutter in the same Aramaic dialect. The sisters found the manuscripts in the antiquities market of Cairo and acquired them for the library in Westminster College. It was sold in 2010 to the Green Collection. They edited also many other important manuscripts in Syriac and Arabic. In 1897 Lewis and Gibson also found and purchased some fragments of parchment of the Cairo Genizah whilst travelling in the Middle East. With the support of Solomon Schechter they made several more trips to the Middle East, locating the majority of the Genizah at the Ben Ezra Synagogue in Cairo. Schechter identified the fragments as forming part of the Hebrew Wisdom of Sirach.Taylor-Schechter Genizah - A Priceless Collection The Cairo Genizah collection was put up for sale by Westminster College for ¬£1.2 million in 2013. The two Oxbridge libraries, the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford and Cambridge's Cambridge University Library combined to raise funds to buy the collection from Westminster after it was put up for sale. This is the first time the two libraries have collaborated for such a fundraising effort. The money was used by Westminster College to help finance a ¬£7 million refurbishment of the College in 2013-2014.Leaflet Westminster College (\\"Newly Refurbished Accommodation\\"), July 2014 Today The college is not part of the University of Cambridge but has joined with six other religious colleges in Cambridge to form the Cambridge Theological Federation, which is affiliated with the university. In concentrating on religious studies for training clergy, the college is in some ways closer to the original conception of the main university colleges when they were founded. Currently, Westminster has connected with it around 50 students; some in training for ministry in the United Reformed Church, and some studying for other work or pleasure. Westminster is served by five academic staff, covering the traditional theological disciplines of Systematic Theology, Church History, Old Testament Studies, New Testament Studies and Pastoral Studies. Traditionally, most students have studied for four years, which includes an internship year working in a local church. However, the College now trains many students part- time and via distance learning, as well as through full-time in-house courses. Most students still work, nonetheless, either for a BA or MA degree (awarded by Anglia Ruskin University) or a BTh or BA/Tripos degree (awarded by Cambridge University). Since 2017 the Westminster College site has also been home to the Woolf Institute of Abrahamic Faiths and Faraday Institute for Science and Religion.BB+C Architects, Woolf Institute of Abrahamic Faiths, accessed 21 August 2018 Westminster College is also affiliated with the American writer and Presbyterian theologian, Frederick Buechner. The College awards an annual prize for Excellence in Writing named after the author.

It was first performed at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Ath√©n√©e in Paris in a production that opened on 17 April 1947, which Louis Jouvet directed. and The play by the Maribor Slovene National Theatre in 1969 The play has been revived in France, England, and the United States on multiple occasions, sometimes with men playing the roles of the maids. A TV dramatization Stuepigerne was done by Danish national broadcaster Danmarks Radio in 1962. A film adaptation of the play was released in 1974. Swedish composer adapted the play in 1994 for a chamber opera. Background Genet loosely based his play on the infamous sisters Christine and L√©a Papin, who brutally murdered their employer and her daughter in Le Mans, France, in 1933. In an introduction written for The Maids, Jean-Paul Sartre quotes a line from Genet's novel Our Lady of the Flowers in which a character muses that if he had a play written for women he'd cast adolescent boys in the parts. Sartre then speculates on having this idea applied to The Maids. Plot Solange and Claire are two housemaids who construct elaborate sadomasochistic rituals when their mistress (Madame) is away. The focus of their role-playing is the murder of Madame and they take turns portraying both sides of the power divide. Their deliberate pace and devotion to detail guarantees that they always fail to actualize their fantasies by ceremoniously \\"killing\\" Madame at the ritual's d√©nouement. Characters * Solange - Maid/sister * Claire - Maid/sister * Madame - Haughty, disdainful mistress * Monsieur - Madame's lover and thief Production history In Britain, the play was first presented in French by the Institute of Contemporary Arts, initially at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate, London, in 1952. Peter Zadek directed, while Eduardo Paolozzi provided the scenic design. Selma Vaz Dias played Solange, Olive Gregg played Claire, and Oriel Ross played Madame. The production subsequently transferred to the Royal Court Theatre, where Betty Stockfeld played Madame and David de Bethel provided the scenic design. Zadek also directed the play's first production in Britain in English, which opened on 5 June 1956 at the New Lindsey Theatre Club. Selma Vaz Dias again played Solange and Betty Stockfeld played Madame, while Hazel Penwarden played Claire. The play was produced at Tempo Playhouse in New York City in 1955, with Julie Bovasso originally as Claire and later as Solange. Bovasso won the first best actress Obie Award for The Maids. Minos Volanakis directed the play at the Oxford Playhouse in 1963. This production was reprised in 1964 in a double bill with Bertolt Brecht's The Exception and the Rule. The play was revived in London at the Greenwich Theatre in 1973 with the actresses Vivien Merchant as Madame, Glenda Jackson as Solange and Susannah York as Claire. This production was filmed as part of the American Film Theatre series in 1974, directed by Christopher Miles and photographed by Douglas Slocombe. Miles and Slocombe planned the 12-day shoot with a single camera which could track anywhere over the set, and deliberately implemented many of Genet's theatrical devices for the film. Clare Davidson directed it at Dublin Theatre Festival; subsequently at The Lyric Theatre Studio Hammersmith on October 12th 1981. With Mark Rylance as Madame.

While mainly used to obtain invariants of knots, they can be viewed as algebraic constructions in their own right. In particular, the definition of a quandle axiomatizes the properties of conjugation in a group. History In 1943, Mituhisa Takasaki (È´òÂ¥éÂÖâ‰πÖ) introduced an algebraic structure which he called a Kei (Âú≠), which would later come to be known as an involutive quandle. His motivation was to find a nonassociative algebraic structure to capture the notion of a reflection in the context of finite geometry. The idea was rediscovered and generalized in (unpublished) 1959 correspondence between John Conway and Gavin Wraith, who at the time were undergraduate students at the University of Cambridge. It is here that the modern definitions of quandles and of racks first appear. Wraith had become interested in these structures (which he initially dubbed sequentials) while at school. Conway renamed them wracks, partly as a pun on his colleague's name, and partly because they arise as the remnants (or 'wrack and ruin') of a group when one discards the multiplicative structure and considers only the conjugation structure. The spelling 'rack' has now become prevalent. These constructs surfaced again in the 1980s: in a 1982 paper by David Joyce (where the term quandle was coined), in a 1982 paper by Sergei Matveev (under the name distributive groupoids) and in a 1986 conference paper by Egbert Brieskorn (where they were called automorphic sets). A detailed overview of racks and their applications in knot theory may be found in the paper by Colin Rourke and Roger Fenn. Racks A rack may be defined as a set \\\\mathrm{R} with a binary operation \\\\triangleleft such that for every a, b, c \\\\in \\\\mathrm{R} the self-distributive law holds: :a \\\\triangleleft(b \\\\triangleleft c) = (a \\\\triangleleft b) \\\\triangleleft(a \\\\triangleleft c) and for every a, b \\\\in \\\\mathrm{R}, there exists a unique c \\\\in \\\\mathrm{R} such that :a \\\\triangleleft c = b. This definition, while terse and commonly used, is suboptimal for certain purposes because it contains an existential quantifier which is not really necessary. To avoid this, we may write the unique c \\\\in \\\\mathrm{R} such that a \\\\triangleleft c = b as b \\\\triangleright a. We then have : a \\\\triangleleft c = b \\\\iff c = b \\\\triangleright a, and thus : a \\\\triangleleft(b \\\\triangleright a) = b, and :(a \\\\triangleleft b) \\\\triangleright a = b. Using this idea, a rack may be equivalently defined as a set \\\\mathrm{R} with two binary operations \\\\triangleleft and \\\\triangleright such that for all a, b, c \\\\in \\\\mathrm{R}\\\\text{:} #a \\\\triangleleft(b \\\\triangleleft c) = (a \\\\triangleleft b) \\\\triangleleft(a \\\\triangleleft c) (left self-distributive law) #(c \\\\triangleright b) \\\\triangleright a = (c \\\\triangleright a) \\\\triangleright(b \\\\triangleright a) (right self-distributive law) #(a \\\\triangleleft b) \\\\triangleright a = b #a \\\\triangleleft(b \\\\triangleright a) = b It is convenient to say that the element a \\\\in \\\\mathrm{R} is acting from the left in the expression a \\\\triangleleft b, and acting from the right in the expression b \\\\triangleright a. The third and fourth rack axioms then say that these left and right actions are inverses of each other. Using this, we can eliminate either one of these actions from the definition of rack. If we eliminate the right action and keep the left one, we obtain the terse definition given initially. Many different conventions are used in the literature on racks and quandles. For example, many authors prefer to work with just the right action. Furthermore, the use of the symbols \\\\triangleleft and \\\\triangleright is by no means universal: many authors use exponential notation :a \\\\triangleleft b = {}^a b and :b \\\\triangleright a = b^a, while many others write :b \\\\triangleright a = b \\\\star a. Yet another equivalent definition of a rack is that it is a set where each element acts on the left and right as automorphisms of the rack, with the left action being the inverse of the right one. In this definition, the fact that each element acts as automorphisms encodes the left and right self-distributivity laws, and also these laws: :\\\\begin{align} a \\\\triangleleft(b \\\\triangleright c) &= (a \\\\triangleleft b) \\\\triangleright(a\\\\ \\\\triangleleft c)  (c \\\\triangleleft b) \\\\triangleright a &= (c \\\\triangleright a) \\\\triangleleft(b \\\\triangleright a) \\\\end{align} which are consequences of the definition(s) given earlier. Quandles A quandle is defined as a rack, \\\\mathrm{Q}, such that for all a \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Q} : a \\\\triangleleft a = a, or equivalently : a \\\\triangleright a = a. Examples and applications Every group gives a quandle where the operations come from conjugation: : \\\\begin{align} a \\\\triangleleft b &= a b a^{-1}  b \\\\triangleright a &= a^{-1} b a  &= a^{-1} \\\\triangleleft b \\\\end{align} In fact, every equational law satisfied by conjugation in a group follows from the quandle axioms. So, one can think of a quandle as what is left of a group when we forget multiplication, the identity, and inverses, and only remember the operation of conjugation. Every tame knot in three-dimensional Euclidean space has a 'fundamental quandle'. To define this, one can note that the fundamental group of the knot complement, or knot group, has a presentation (the Wirtinger presentation) in which the relations only involve conjugation. So, this presentation can also be used as a presentation of a quandle. The fundamental quandle is a very powerful invariant of knots. In particular, if two knots have isomorphic fundamental quandles then there is a homeomorphism of three-dimensional Euclidean space, which may be orientation reversing, taking one knot to the other. Less powerful but more easily computable invariants of knots may be obtained by counting the homomorphisms from the knot quandle to a fixed quandle \\\\mathrm{Q}. Since the Wirtinger presentation has one generator for each strand in a knot diagram, these invariants can be computed by counting ways of labelling each strand by an element of \\\\mathrm{Q}, subject to certain constraints. More sophisticated invariants of this sort can be constructed with the help of quandle cohomology. The are also important, since they can be used to compute the Alexander polynomial of a knot. Let \\\\mathrm{A} be a module over the ring \\\\mathbb{Z}[t, t^{-1}] of Laurent polynomials in one variable. Then the Alexander quandle is \\\\mathrm{A} made into a quandle with the left action given by :a \\\\triangleleft b = tb + (1 - t)a. Racks are a useful generalization of quandles in topology, since while quandles can represent knots on a round linear object (such as rope or a thread), racks can represent ribbons, which may be twisted as well as knotted. A quandle \\\\mathrm{Q} is said to be involutory if for all a, b \\\\in \\\\mathrm{Q}, : a \\\\triangleleft(a \\\\triangleleft b) = b or equivalently, : (b \\\\triangleright a) \\\\triangleright a = b . Any symmetric space gives an involutory quandle, where a \\\\triangleleft b is the result of 'reflecting b through a'.

He was born about the middle of the ninth century. Abbo was present at the Siege of Paris by the Vikings in 885-886\\\\. He was the only eyewitness who wrote a description of it, in Latin verse, with an account of subsequent events to 896, the so-called De bellis Parisiac√¶ urbis or Bella Parisiac√¶ urbis (\\"Wars of the City of Paris\\"). Abbo also left some sermons for the instruction of clerics in Paris and Poitiers (Patrologia Latina, CXXXII). Life Though coming from one of the most prominent ecclesiastical centres of ninth-century Francia the monk Abbo is unusually obscure for an individual responsible for a source such as the De bellis.Dass, 1. The little that we do know is gleaned from this work, with very little corroboratory evidence from elsewhere. Though we know he was a Neustrian we do not know his political agenda or affiliations, as he contradicts his own \\"views\\" throughout the work. As a result, historians have often speculated that the De bellis was \\"refined\\" at a later date by a separate editor. Abbo can be viewed as a source for the collapse of Carolingian hegemony in 887‚Äì88. He regarded Odo as the legitimate successor of Charles the Fat in West Francia after Charles' death (888) and does not seem to have regarded the deposition of East Francia as binding on West Francia. Abbo also regards the empire as Frankish and he himself, though a Neustrian and Parisian, as Frankish as well. He does not present a united West Francia as a more basic political unit than the empire and is therefore seen by some historians as refuting the hypothesis that regional identities led to the breakup of the empire within Abbo's lifetime.MacLean, 64. We have no definitive date for Abbo's death, though it has been assumed to be later than 922. Around that year Bishop Fulrad of Paris endeavored to publish a selection of Abbo's sermons. If the bishop was willing to publish his sermons while Abbo was still alive, why did he choose not to endorse the De bellis?Dass, 2. De bellis Parisiac√¶ urbis The Wars of the City of Paris was written in the 890s. The poem itself narrates events taking place over an eleven-year period from 885 to 896. It was first composed circa 890 and later extended up to 896. The entire poem consists of 1,393 lines in three books: 660 lines in the first book, 618 in the second, and 115 in the third. Throughout the poem Abbo employs a dactylic hexameter, though with the occasional fault. This metre helps to underpin the epic nature of the poem, a conscious aim of Abbo. The purpose of the work was both scholarly and hortative, warning future generations of the Viking menace.MacLean, 55. Its polemic literary style (sometimes called the \\"hermeneutic style\\") is typical of its period and place, though it is studded with \\"obscure Grecisms.\\" It has usually received negative criticism from historians, or even been viewed as a contemporary parody of the hermeneutic style. A detailed and political work, it has been underused by historians of the late Carolingians.MacLean, 56. It may have been written at the bequest or insistence of Odo of France, who appears as the hero and \\"future king\\" (rex futurus) in the poem.MacLean, 57. The poet views Odo through the lens of the 890s. He praises Odo as \\"the noblest\\" of the city of Paris, more so than Askericus or Joscelin. Abbo also presents the Emperor Charles III, whom he refers to as basileus Francorum (\\"emperor of the Franks\\"), in a positive light.MacLean, 58. The poem stresses the magnitude and diversity of the united Frankish empire. Significantly, he places no blame on the emperor for the siege of Paris nor for the subsequent harrying of Burgundy, which he actually considered to be appropriate for the Burgundians' refusal to aid the city.MacLean, 60. Abbo even warns the Neustrians not to use \\"the purple to keep warm\\", a reference to overreliance on imperial protection, purple being an imperial colour.MacLean, 59. The term basileus is likewise a distinctly Byzantine term.

History Giethoorn used to be a pedestrian precinct, but nowadays exceptions are made. It became locally famous, especially after 1958, when the Dutch film maker Bert Haanstra made his famous comedy Fanfare there. In the old part of the village, there were no roads (though a cycling path was eventually added), and all transport was done by water over one of the many canals. The lakes in Giethoorn were formed by peat unearthing. Giethoorn was a separate municipality until 1973, when it became part of Brederwiede, which lost its municipality status in 2001 to merge with Steenwijk.

If a commendatory abbot is an ecclesiastic, however, he may have limited jurisdiction. Originally only vacant abbeys, or those that were temporarily without an actual superior, were given in commendam, in the latter case only until an actual superior was elected or appointed. An abbey is held in commendam, i.e. provisorily, in distinction to one held in titulum, which is a permanent benefice.Ott, Michael. \\"In Commendam.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 26 Jul. 2015 History Originally only vacant abbeys, or such as were temporarily without an actual superior, were given in commendam, in the latter case only until an actual superior was elected or appointed.Ott, Michael. \\"Commendatory Abbot.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 26 Jul. 2015 Pope Gregory the Great (590‚Äì604) on various occasions gave vacant abbeys in commendam to bishops who had been driven from their episcopal sees by invading barbarians or whose own churches were too poor to furnish them a decent livelihood. The practice began to be seriously abused in the eighth century when the Anglo- Saxon and Frankish kings assumed the right to set commendatory abbots over monasteries that were occupied by religious communities. Often these commendatory abbots were laymen, vassals of the kings, or others who were authorized to draw the revenues and manage the temporal affairs of the monasteries in reward for military services. The practice was especially widespread during the reigns of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, Philip I of France, William the Conqueror, William Rufus, Henry I and Henry II of England. Such a system often proved disastrous for monastic discipline, as the commendatory ‚Äúabbot‚Äù of the community was rarely a monk, nor was he often even present in the monastery. Such a system divided the revenues of the monastery between the mensa abbatialis (the ‚Äúabbot‚Äôs table‚Äù) and the mensa conventualis (the ‚Äúmonk‚Äôs table‚Äù) The commendatory abbot would take his portion, thereby reducing the resources of the monks. It was a common arrangement that the commendatory abbot would retain two thirds of the revenue for his own use and leave the remaining third for the support of the abbey. The commendatory bishop was bound to defray the expenses of the community, to keep the buildings in repair, to furnish the ornaments for divine service, and to give suitable alms.Butler, Charles, The Lives of Dom Armand-Jean Le Bouthillier de Ranc√©, Abbot Regular and Reformer of the Monastery of La Trappe; and of Thomas √Ä Kempis, Longman & Company, 1814 Nonetheless, many did not and buildings fell into disrepair and new members could even be turned away on account of a simple lack of funds. After the eighth century various attempts were made by popes and councils to regulate the appointment of commendatory abbots. At the Concordat of Worms in 1122, when the Investiture Controversy was settled in favour of the church, the appointment of laymen as commendatory abbots was abolished. The practice again increased during the Avignon Papacy (1309‚Äì1377) and especially during the Papal Schism (1378‚Äì1417), when the papal claimants gave numerous abbeys in commendam in order to increase the number of their adherents. Partial list of the French commendatory abbeys in 1742 Boniface VIII (1294‚Äì1303) decreed that a benefice with the cure of souls attached should be granted in commendam only in great necessity or when evident advantage would accrue to the Church, but never for more than six months. Clement V (1305‚Äì1314) revoked benefices which had been granted by him in commendam earlier. The Council of Trent determined that vacant monasteries should be bestowed only on pious and virtuous regulars, and that the motherhouse of an order, and the abbeys and priories founded immediately from it, should no longer be granted in commendam. The succeeding bull \\"Superna\\" of Gregory XIII and the constitution \\"Pastoralis\\" of Innocent X greatly checked in commendam appointments but did not abolish them entirely. In spite of various efforts to reform such a system, it continued to plague the monastic orders throughout the centuries.\\"Medieval and Early Modern Challenges\\", Our Lady of Dallas Cistercian Abbey Especially in France, they continued to flourish to the detriment of the monasteries; for example Cluny Abbey. On the eve of the French Revolution of 1789, of the two-hundred-thirty-seven Cistercian institutions in France, only thirty-five were governed by regular Cistercian abbots. Finally the French Revolution and the general secularization of monasteries in the beginning of the eighteenth century reduced the significance of commendatory abbots along with the significance of monasteries in general. Since that time commendatory abbots have become very rare, and the former abuses have been abolished by careful regulations. There are still a few commendatory abbots among the cardinals; Pope Pius X himself was Commendatory Abbot of the Benedictine monastery at Subiaco near Rome. Authority If the monastery is occupied by a religious community where there is a separate mensa abbatialis, i.e. where the abbot and the convent have each a separate income, the commendatory abbot, who must then be an ecclesiastic, has jurisdiction in foro externo over the members of the community and enjoys all the rights and privileges of an actual abbot. Under the title of Claustral Prior a regular superior was appointed to supervise the internal discipline of the house. If there is no separate mensa abbatialis, the power of the commendatory abbot extends only over the temporal affairs of the monastery. In case of vacant monasteries the commendatory abbot generally has all the rights and privileges of an actual abbot.

The custom existed principally in the Frankish Empire from the eighth century until the ecclesiastical reforms of the eleventh. Background Numerous synods held in France in the sixth and seventh centuries passed decrees against this abuse of church property. The Merovingians had bestowed church lands on laymen, or at least allowed them their possession and use, though not ownership.Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"Lay Abbot.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 26 Jul. 2015 The Merovingian kings were also in the habit of appointing abbots to monasteries which they had founded; moreover, many monasteries, though not founded by the king, placed themselves under royal patronage in order to share his protection, and so became possessions of the Crown. History This custom of the Merovingian rulers was taken as a precedent by the French kings for rewarding laymen with abbeys, or giving them to bishops in commendam. Charles Martel was the first to bestow outright extensive existing ecclesiastical property upon laymen, political friends and soldiers. St. Boniface and later Hincmar of Reims picture most dismally the consequent downfall of church discipline, and though Boniface tried to reform the Frankish Church, the bestowal of abbeys on secular abbots was not abolished. Charlemagne also frequently gave church property, and sometimes abbeys, in feudal tenure. The abbey of Saint-Riquier (Centula) in Picardy had secular abbots from the time of Charlemagne, who had given it to his friend Angilbert, the poet and the lover of his daughter Bertha, and father of her two sons. After Angilbert's death in 814, the abbey was given to other laymen. Louis the Pious aided St. Benedict of Aniane in his endeavours to reform the monastic life. In order to accomplish this it was necessary to restore the free election of abbots, and the appointment as well of blameless monks as heads of the monastic houses. Although Louis shared these principles, he continued to bestow abbeys on laymen, and his sons imitated him. Although not a cleric, Einhard was lay abbot of the monastery of St. Bavo in Ghent and at his own foundation at Michelstadt.Ganz, David. \\"Einhardus Peccator\\", Lay Intellectuals in the Carolingian World, (Patrick Wormald and Janet L. Nelson, eds.), Cambridge University Press, 2007 Various synods of the ninth century passed decrees against this custom; the Synod of Diedenhofen (October, 844) decreed in its third canon, that abbeys should no longer remain in the power of laymen, but that monks should be their abbotsKarl Josef von Hefele, Konziliengeschichte, 2nd ed., IV, 110 In like manner the Synods of Meaux and Paris (845-846) complained that the monasteries held by laymen had fallen into decay, and emphasized the king's duty in this respect.Hefele, op. cit., IV, 115 But abbeys continued to be bestowed upon laymen, especially in France and Lorraine, e.g. St. Evre near Toul, in the reign of Lothair I. Lothair II, however, restored it to ecclesiastical control in 858, but the same king gave Bonmoutier to a layman; and the Abbeys of St. Germain and St. Martin, in the Diocese of Toul, were also given to secular abbots. In the Diocese of Metz, the Abbey of Gorze was long in the hands of laymen, and under them fell into decay. Stavelot and Malmedy, in the Diocese of Li√®ge, were in the eleventh century bestowed on a certain Count Raginarius, as also St. Maximin near Trier on a Count Adalhard, etc.Albert Hauck, Kirchengeschichte Deutschland, II, 598 In 888 a Synod of Mainz decreed (canon xxv) that the secular abbots should place able provosts and provisors over their monasteries. In a synod held at Trosly, in the Diocese of Soissons, in 909, sharp complaints were made (ch. iii) about the lives of monks; many convents, it was said, were governed by laymen, whose wives and children, soldiers and dogs, were housed in the precincts of the religious. To better these conditions it was necessary, the synod declared, to restore the regular abbots and abbesses; at the same time ecclesiastical canons and royal capitularies declared laymen quite devoid of authority in church affairs.Hefele, op. cit., IV, 572-73 Lay abbots existed in the tenth century, also in the eleventh. Cr√≠n√°n of Dunkeld (d. 1045) was the lay abbot of the monastery of Dunkeld. While the title of Hereditary Lay Abbot was a feudal position that was often exercised in name only, Crin√°n seems to have acted as Abbot in charge of the monastery in his time. He was thus a man of high position in both clerical and secular society. Gosfred, Duke of Aquitaine, was Abbot of the monastery of St. Hilary at Poitiers, and as such he published the decrees issued (1078) at the Synod of Poitiers.Hefele, op. cit., V, 116 It was only through the so-called investitures conflict that the Church was freed from secular domination; the reforms brought about by the papacy put an end to the bestowal of abbeys upon laymen.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 19 Sept. 2012 Nothing certain is known about him. History of the Apostolical Contest An apocryphal work in ten books called Historia Certaminis Apostolici (\\"History of the Apostolical Contest\\")often referred to as the \\"Apostolic History of pseudo-Abdias\\" was traditionally ascribed to an Abdias, assumed to be this bishop of Babylon. It is a major collection of New Testament apocrypha, which tells of the labors and miracles, persecution and deaths of the Apostles. It exhibits a taste for the marvelous that places the narratives in the genre of heroic romances, of which \\"these stories came at length to form a sort of apostolic cycle\\" Matthew B. Riddle, Introductory Notice to Apocrypha of the New Testament (1870).Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. VIII This compilation purports to have been translated from Hebrew into Greek by \\"Eutropius\\", a disciple of Abdias, and, in the third century, from Greek into Latin by Sextus Julius Africanus, the friend of Origen, or as reported in Golden Legend by his disciple Tropaeus Africanus.The Golden Legend: The Lives of Saints Simon and Jude Later scholarship determined the book was originally written in Latin, probably around 910 AD, long after the death of Abdias of Babylon. The most obvious clues include the book's citations of the Vulgate of St Jerome, of the Ecclesiastical History of Rufinus and of his Latin translation of the Recognitiones of Clement. An earlier date of composition is given by R. A. Lipsius, who theorizes the work was compiled during the latter half of the sixth century, in an unidentified Frankish monastery, for the purpose of satisfying the natural curiosity of Western Christians. At the same time the author of this Historia used much older pseudo-Apostolic materials that he abridged or excerpted to suit his purpose. He often revised or expurgated to conform them to Catholic teaching, because many of the writings that he used were originally Gnostic compositions, filled with Gnostic speeches and prayers. The work is of interest because of what the author claims to have drawn from the ancient Acta of the Apostles, and because of many ancient legends which have survived in this collection. The text of the compiler who may then be called the Pseudo-Abdias may be found in Constantin von Tischendorf, and in the Codex Apocryphus Novi Testimenti of Johann Albert Fabricius.

Her mother, a physician, was a pioneer in homeopathy and one of the first women to earn a medical degree from Columbia University. She had two brothers, Theodore and Merle, an opera talent manager. Elizabeth attended Radcliffe College, and graduated summa cum laude. She pursued her theatrical education at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, where she was the first American to receive the school's silver medal. She was married to furrier David Bennett from 1970 to 1972; they had one child, a son, Jeremy Bennett (born September 20, 1971). Soap operas She is best known for her work in daytime soap operas. She began that career in 1962, starring as Anne Fletcher on Guiding Light. The following year, she joined the cast of The Edge of Night as Carol Kramer for another short stint. In 1964, she originated the role of Dr. Althea Davis on NBC's year-old soap opera The Doctors. Hubbard played the role until October 1969, when she left to pursue a career in Hollywood. She returned to the role as of October 1, 1970 and continued the role until 1977. She returned again in 1981 and remained with the show until its cancellation in 1982. In 1974, Hubbard was awarded the first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Hubbard's pairing with the character of Dr. Nick Bellini (Gerald Gordon) made them one of the most popular romantic couples on the soaps, dominating the show's storyline during the later half of the 1960s and for most of the 1970s.

Nothing is known historically about these saints except their names, that they were martyrs, and that they were buried on 30 July of some year in the Cemetery of Pontianus on the Via Portuensis. Because of this lack of knowledge about them, they are no longer listed in the General Roman Calendar to be commemorated liturgically worldwide,\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 132 but they may still be celebrated everywhere on their feast day unless in some locality an obligatory celebration is assigned to that day.General Instruction of the Roman Missal , 355 c The rank of their celebration was given as \\"Simple\\" in the Tridentine Calendar and remained such until the classification was changed to that of \\"Commemoration\\" in the General Roman Calendar of 1960. Veneration Their Acts, written for the most part prior to the 9th century, describe them as Persians martyred under Decius, approximately in the year 250 A.D. Their Acts contain several fictitious statements about the cause, the circumstances of their coming to Rome and the nature of their torments. They relate that their bodies were buried by a subdeacon, Quirinus, and later transferred in the reign of Constantine to the Cemetery of Pontianus on the road to Porto, near the gates of Rome. A fresco found on the sarcophagus supposed to contain their remains represents them receiving crowns from Christ. According to Martigny, this fresco dates from the seventh century. Several cities, notably Florence and Soissons, claim possession of their bodies, but the Bollandists say that they rest in Rome, in the Basilica of St. Mark. The Benedictine Abbey of Sainte Marie in Arles-sur-Tech, France also claims a tomb. Abdon and Sennen are patron saints of Calasparra, in Murcia, Spain.

The film is loosely based on the real life kidnapping of Gerrit Jan Heijn that took place in the Netherlands in 1987. The screenplay was written by Justin Haythe. Plot Wayne Hayes (Robert Redford), and his wife Eileen (Helen Mirren) are living the American dream in a wealthy Pittsburgh suburb, having raised two children (Alessandro Nivola, Melissa Sagemiller) and built up a successful business from scratch. He is looking forward to a peaceful retirement with Eileen. Everything changes when Wayne is kidnapped in broad daylight by a former employee, Arnold Mack (Willem Dafoe). While Wayne tries negotiating with the kidnapper, Eileen works with the FBI to try to secure her husband's release. During the investigation, Eileen learns that Wayne has continued an extramarital affair that he promised to end months previously. Eileen is eventually instructed to deliver the ransom to the kidnapper, but Arnold takes the money without returning her husband; Arnold murdered Wayne the day of the kidnapping. Although Eileen's ordeal takes place over the course of a week, the film is edited to show Wayne's kidnapping as if it was happening at the same time. Arnold is eventually caught when he begins to spend the ransom money in the neighborhood where he lives. At a local grocery store, he uses a $100 bill to make a purchase. The store manager calls authorities and verifies the serial number on the $100 bill is on a watch list the FBI distributed to local businesses. During questioning Arnold is asked if he wanted to be caught, and he admits that the kidnapping was to get money for his depressed wife, but it took him all day to bring himself to kill Wayne and he could not live with the guilt of his crime. In the end, Eileen receives a loving note written by Wayne before his death.

It is an important example of early Christian epigraphy. Archeology and context About the middle of the 2nd century, Abercius left his episcopal city and visited Rome. On his way home he travelled through Syria and Mesopotamia, and was received with great honours in various places. He died shortly after his return to Hieropolis, but not before he had composed his own epitaph, conveying a most vivid impression of all he had admired during his stay in Rome. This epitaph may well have inspired the Life of Abercius such as it has come down to us, since all its details may be explained by the hints contained in the inscription, or else belong to the common foundation of all legends of saints. The Life, as a matter of fact, includes a transcription of the epitaph. Tillemont was greatly struck by the ideas therein expressed, and Pitra endeavoured to prove its authenticity and its important bearing on Christian symbolism. Ernest Renan regarded both the Life and inscription as fanciful compositions, but in 1882 the Scottish archaeologist and scholar William Ramsay discovered at Kelendres, near Synnada, in the Roman province of Phrygia Salutaris (in Asia Minor, modern Anatolia), a Christian stele (inscribed slab) bearing the date of the year 300 of the Phrygian era (AD 216). The inscription in question recalled the memory of a certain Alexander, son of Anthony. De Rossi and Duchesne at once recognized in it phrases similar to those in the epitaph of Abercius. On comparison it was found that the inscription in memory of Alexander corresponded, almost word for word, with the first and last verses of the epitaph of the Bishop of Hieropolis; all the middle part was missing. Mr. Ramsay, on a second visit to the site of Hieropolis, in 1883, discovered two new fragments covered with inscriptions, built into the masonry of the public baths. These fragments, which are now in the Vatican Christian Museum, filled out the middle part of the stele inscribed with the epitaph of Abercius. Reconstructed epitaph  It now became possible, with the help of the text preserved in the Life, to restore the original text of the epitaph with practical certainty. Certain lacunae, letters effaced or cut off by breaks in the stone, have been the subject of profound discussions, resulting in a text which may henceforth be looked on as settled, which it may be useful to give here. The capital letters at the beginning and end of the inscription represent the parts found on the inscription of Alexander, the son of Anthony, those of the middle part are the remaining fragments of the epitaph of Abercius, while the small letters give the reading according to the manuscripts of the Life: > The citizen of a chosen city, this [monument] I made [while] living, that > there I might have in time a resting-place of my body, [I] being by name > Abercius, the disciple of a holy shepherd who feeds flocks of sheep [both] > on mountains and on plains, who has great eyes that see everywhere. For this > [shepherd] taught me [that the] book [of life] is worthy of belief. And to > Rome he sent me to contemplate majesty, and to see a queen golden-robed and > golden-sandalled; there also I saw a people bearing a shining mark. And I > saw the land of Syria and all [its] cities; Nisibis [I saw] when I passed > over Euphrates. But everywhere I had brethren. I had Paul ... Faith > everywhere led me forward, and everywhere provided as my food a fish of > exceeding great size, and perfect, which a holy virgin drew with her hands > from a fountain and this it [faith] ever gives to its friends to eat, it > having wine of great virtue, and giving it mingled with bread. These things > I, Abercius, having been a witness [of them] told to be written here. Verily > I was passing through my seventy-second year. He that discerneth these > things, every fellow-believer [namely], let him pray for Abercius. And no > one shall put another grave over my grave; but if he do, then shall he pay > to the treasury of [the] Romans two thousand pieces of gold and to my good > native city of Hieropolis one thousand pieces of gold. Theories and conclusions The interpretation of this inscription has stimulated ingenious efforts and very animated controversies. In 1894 G. Ficker, supported by Otto Hirschfeld, strove to prove that Abercius was a priest of the mother goddess Cybele. In 1895 Adolf von Harnack offered an explanation which was sufficiently obscure, making Abercius the representative of an ill-defined religious syncretism arbitrarily combined in such a fashion as to explain all portions of the inscription which were otherwise inexplicable. In 1896, Albrecht Dieterich made Abercius a priest of Attis. These plausible theories have been refuted by several learned archaeologists, especially by De Rossi, Duchesne and Franz Cumont. Nor is there any further need to enter into the questions raised in one quarter or another; the following conclusions are indisputably historical. The epitaph of Abercius is generally, and with good reason, regarded as older than that of Alexander, the son of Anthony, i.e. prior to the year 216 AD. The subject of it may be identified with a writer named Abercius Marcellus, author of a work against the Montanists, some fragments of which have been preserved by Eusebius. As that treatise was written about the year 193, the epitaph may be assigned to the last years of the second, or to the beginning of the third, century. The writer was bishop of a little town, the name of which is wrongly given in the Life, since he belongs to Hieropolis in Phrygia Salutaris, and not to Hierapolis in Phrygia Pacatiensis. The proof of this fact given by Duchesne is all that could be wished for. The text of the inscription itself is of the greatest possible importance in connection with the symbolism of the early church. The poem of sixteen verses which forms the epitaph shows plainly that the language used is one not understood by all: Let the brother who shall understand this pray for Abercius. The bishop's journey to Rome is merely mentioned, but on his way home he gives us the principal stages of his itinerary. He passed along the Syrian coast and possibly came to Antioch, thence to Nisibis, after having traversed the whole of Syria, while his return to Hieropolis may have been by way of Edessa. The allusion to the Apostle Paul, which a gap in the text renders indecipherable, may originally have told how the traveler followed on his way back to his country the stages of Paul's third missionary journey, namely: Issus, Tarsus, Derbe, Iconium, Antioch in Pisidia and Apamea Cibotus, which would bring him into the heart of Phrygia. The inscription bears witness of no slight value to the importance of the church of Rome in the 2nd century. A mere glance at the text allows us to note: # The evidence of baptism which marks the Christian people with its dazzling seal; # The spread of Christianity, whose members Abercius meets with everywhere; # The receiving of Jesus, the Son of God and of Mary, in the Eucharist, # The receiving of the Eucharist under the species of Bread and Wine. # The belief in prayers for the dead amongst the Christian people The liturgical cultus of Abercius presents no point of special interest; his name appears for the first time in the Greek menologies and synaxaries of the 10th century, but is not found in the Martyrology of St. Jerome.

He is generally portrayed as an 8- to 10-year-old boy with a big conical wizard hat. His name is taken from the Nahuatl word for child: \\"Cipit\\" or \\"Cipote\\". Some also relate his name to the deity Xipe Totec. According to the legend, he is the son of a forbidden romance between an indigenous Mesoamerican queen called Sihuehuet or Ziguet, now commonly known as La Siguanaba, and \\"Lucero de la ma√±ana\\" (L√∫cifer Morningstar). Cipitio is the child of this affair. When Ziguet's husband finds out about this affair he seeks the assistance of the very powerful god Teotl. Ziguet and Cipitio were cursed and condemned by Teotl. Cipitio was going to live forever as a small boy with his feet in backwards position, as a reminder of the twisted and illicit affair of his parents. Stories are told of farmers that come to their fields and find the footsteps of a boy, but eventually get lost following them because, not knowing that Cipitio has backwards feet, they follow the footsteps in the wrong direction.Kampwirth and Gonzalez 173.

He was the father of Anthony Barclay, who served on the Supreme Court of Liberia, and uncle of the 18th president, Edwin Barclay. His first teacher was his oldest sister, Antoinette Barclay. He later entered the Preparatory Department of Liberia College, under the principalship of Anthony T. Ferguson. Having completed the course prescribed, he matriculated into the Collegiate Department and graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in the Class of 1873. Career Mrs. Barclay, wife of President Arthur Barclay, and the pupils of a girl's school. In 1877, he was appointed principal of the Preparatory Department of his alma mater, which position he held for a number of years, and served during the vacation as chief clerk of the House of Representatives. His later services to the said institution were: professor, member of the board of trustees, and sometimes acting president. He was called to the bar of Montserrado County in 1877, and after practising law for three years, he attained the rank of counsellor of the supreme court in the year 1880. His first official position was private secretary to President Joseph Jenkins Roberts, from 1874; his second, judge of the Court of Quarter Sessions and Common Pleas of Montserrado County to which he was appointed by President Alfred F. Russell, in 1883. In 1885, President Hilary R. W. Johnson appointed him sub-treasurer of Montserrado County, which post he held for 5 years. He was mayor of Monrovia from 1892 until 1902. In 1892, President Joseph James Cheeseman, on taking office, elevated him to Cabinet rank as postmaster-general, and afterwards to the post of secretary of state. On the death of H. A. Williams in 1896, he was appointed secretary of the treasury, which position he held continuously until his election to the presidency in May 1903. Inaugurated in January, 1904, he served until January 1912. After his retirement he frequently acted as secretary of state, secretary of the treasury, and secretary of the interior and war. He was president of Liberia College, 1914‚Äì1917. He served upon the following diplomatic commissions: * In 1893, associated with Senator A. B. King, and William Rothery, he was sent as a commissioner to the World's Fair at Chicago, Illinois, United States. * In 1897, associated with Attorney-General Stevens, he went to London, England, to arrange with the Council of Foreign Bondholders for the amortization of the loan of 1870, contracted in the administration of President Edward James Roye, which had been in default for over 20 years. * In 1901, he was associated with Chief Justice Z. B. Roberts and Senator A. B. King on diplomatic missions to England and France. Presidency (1904‚Äì1912) Arthur Barclay was president from 1904 to 1912. In addition to continued internal unrest, the country faced a severe economic crisis and huge indebtedness to European creditors. In the decades after 1868, escalating economic difficulties weakened the state's dominance over the coastal indigenous population. Conditions worsened, as the cost of imports was far greater than the income generated by exports of coffee, rice, palm oil, sugarcane, and timber. Liberia tried desperately to modernize its largely agricultural economy. In 1907, while president of the nation, he headed the mission to arrange boundary disputes with the British and French Governments, associating with F. E. R. Johnson, secretary of state, and T. McCants Stewart, Deputy Attorney-General of Liberia. Under his government, the Liberian Frontier Force was created, which later evolved into the Liberian Armed Forces.

In 1942 a total of 635 vehicles were produced, 1943 there were 13,000 and 1944 only 7,310 History Soon after invading the USSR, German troops discovered that their wheeled transport vehicles were unsuitable for the sparse road network, particularly in the muddy conditions of the rasputitsa. Only half tracks like the Sd.Kfz. 11 could haul supplies to forward units in these conditions, but removing them from their combat role for supply duties was not feasible, so it was decided to produce half-tracked versions of standard Opel, Daimler-Benz, Alfa-Romeo and Ford trucks (lorries) by removing their rear axles, truncating the prop shafts and connecting them to redundant Panzer I track assemblies. Heavier trucks (4 tons payload) were fitted with Panzer II track assemblies. Horstmann suspension components employed by the Panzer I was practically identical to the light tank track system used on the Universal Carrier, with the Maultier's use of them closely resembling the roadwheel/suspension system used by the T16 American-produced version in its roadwheel design. Most Maultier conversions were based on Opel Blitz model S trucks, which proved successful in service. Although they lacked the overall mobility of purpose-built half tracks, they were cheaper and sufficiently effective. From 1943 some Maultier trucks were fitted with armored bodies, designated Sd.Kfz. 4. Some of these were armed with 10 tubed rocket launcher Panzerwerfer 42, and were designated Sd.Kfz.. 4/1.

Career  Born in Bethnal Green, London, England, Poulton worked as a stenographer and entered films by chance. Her first role in George Pearson's Nothing Else Matters (1920) was opposite Betty Balfour, who was also making her debut, and the film was a success. Over the next several years, Poulton was cast in a succession of roles, and usually played feisty or mischievous characters. A petite blonde, she also became well regarded for her fashion style, and was a highly recognisable celebrity. In 1928, she starred in The Constant Nymph by Adrian Brunel and received excellent reviews for her performance. By the end of the decade, she was considered to be one of Britain's leading screen actresses along with Balfour, and was described by critics as Balfour's only serious rival. The advent of sound film brought a premature end to Poulton's film career. The addition of the microphone revealed Poulton's broad Cockney accent, which was at odds with the characters she had become identified with. Like Clara Bow who faced the same problem as a result of her Brooklyn accent, Poulton struggled to maintain her status. Also, like Bow, she attempted to mount a comeback in the mid-1930s, which was well publicised but unsuccessful. She made her final film appearance in 1938.  Later years and death  She spent her last years writing and re-writing a typescript about a young British starlet who is raped by a film director and who then descends into alcoholism. In biro, at some point of the writing process, she wrote in real names. Thomas Bentley is the director she accuses. They had worked together on two films: The Old Curiosity Shop (1921) and Not Quite a Lady (1928). She died in 1994 in Merton, Surrey, aged 93.

In 1836 he moved to London, where he worked with the Earl of Munster on the latter's Geschichte der Kriegswissenschaften bei den mohammedanischen V√∂lkern, ‚ÄòHistory of Military Science among the Muslim Peoples‚Äô, and thence in 1843 to Calcutta, where he became principal of Delhi College. In this capacity he had many textbooks translated into Hindustani from European languages. In 1848 he was sent to Lucknow, to prepare a catalogue of the royal library there, the first volume of which appeared in Calcutta in 1854. This book, with its lists of Persian poets, its careful description of all the chief works of Persian poetry and its valuable biographical material, became a worthy guide for the exploration of Persian literature.

It was identical in role and concept to the highly successful StuG III assault gun variant of the Panzer III. Both StuG models were given an exclusively tank destroyer role in German formations and tactical planning in the last two years of the war, greatly augmenting the capability of the dwindling tank force available to the German army on the Eastern and Western fronts. Development A StuG IV destroyed and abandoned in Normandy, 1944. The Sturmgesch√ºtz IV resulted from Krupp's effort to supply an assault gun. As Krupp did not build Panzerkampfwagen IIIs, they used the Panzerkampfwagen IV chassis in combination with a slightly modified Sturmgesch√ºtz III superstructure. The first known proposal for a Sturmgesch√ºtz on the Panzer IV chassis is in Krupp drawing number W1468 dated February 1943. This initial drawing unitized the outdated Sturmgesch√ºtz Ausf. F superstructure on a Panzer IV chassis. This proposal had a sloped front superstructure with a combat weight of 28.26 tons. Krupp abandoned it in February 1943 because it was too heavy. Plans for the StuG IV were halted. During the F√ºhrer Conference of 19 to 22 August 1943, after the Battle of Kursk, Hitler had seen reports of the StuG III outperforming the Panzer IV when used in an infantry support role and tactical defence. Convinced that a tank-hunter version would be superior to the tank version, Hitler planned to switch Panzer IV production to \\"Panzerj√§ger IV\\" production as soon as possible. It was to mount the same 7.5 cm L/70 used for the Panther. Another manufacturer, Vomag built a prototype Panzerj√§ger IV with 7.5 cm L/48 gun and demonstrated it on 20 October 1943. It was later re-designated as Jagdpanzer IV Ausf. F. As the Jagdpanzer IV was already being produced by Vomag, the StuG IV may not have materialized, had it not been for the major disruption of StuG III production, and the scarce supply of the 7.5 cm L/70 gun designated for the Jagdpanzer IV. In November 1943, Alkett, the manufacturer of the StuG III, suffered damage due to an Allied bombing raid. They produced 255 StuG III in October 1943, but in December production fell to just 24 vehicles. A conference held from 6 to 7 December 1943, addressed possible solutions to this problem. Hitler welcomed the suggestion of taking the StuG III superstructure and mounting it on a Panzer IV chassis. The StuG IV could be more quickly manufactured than the Jagdpanzer IV at the time. This restarted the Sturmgesch√ºtz IV project. This time, the superstructure of the StuG III Ausf. G was mounted on a Panzer IV chassis 7, with a box compartment for the driver added. Combat weight was 23000 kg, lighter than the 23900 kg for the StuG III Ausf. G. Between 16 and 17 December 1943, Hitler was shown the StuG IV and approved it. To make up for the large deficit in StuG III production StuG IV production was now given full support. From December 1943 to May 1945, Krupp built 1,108 StuG IVs and converted an additional 31 from battle-damaged Panzer IV hulls. While the number is smaller than the 10,000+ StuG III, the StuG IV supplemented and fought along with StuG III during 1944-45, when they were most needed.  Design  The StuG IV became known as an effective tank killer, especially on the Eastern Front.

Ramachandran, FRS (8 October 1922 ‚Äì 7 April 2001) was an Indian physicist who was known for his work that led to his creation of the Ramachandran plot for understanding peptide structure. He was the first to propose a triple-helical model for the structure of collagen. He subsequently went on to make other major contributions in biology and physics.  Early life and education  Ramachandran was born in the town of Ernakulam, Kingdom of Cochin, India to a Tamil Brahmin family. He completed his BSc honours in Physics from St Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli in 1939. He joined the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 1942 in the Electrical Engineering Department. Quickly realising his interest in physics, he switched to the Department of Physics to complete his master's and doctoral thesis under the supervision of Nobel laureate Sir C. V. Raman. In 1942, he received a master's degree in physics from Madras University with his thesis submitted from Bangalore (he did not attend any Madras college at that time). He subsequently received his D.Sc. degree in 1947. Here he mostly studied crystal physics and crystal optics. During his studies he created an X-ray focusing mirror for the X-ray microscope. The resulting field of crystal topography is used extensively in studies involving crystal growth and solid-state reactivity. Ramachandran then spent two years (1947‚Äì1949) at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, where he earned his PhD for 'studies on X-ray diffuse scattering and its application to determination of elastic constants' under the direction of Professor William Alfred Wooster, popularly known as W.A. Wooster, a leading crystallography expert in the world.  Research Works  After completing his PhD, he returned to the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India in 1949 as an assistant professor of physics. In 1952, he moved to Madras University as professor and head of the Department of Physics where he continued his work on crystal physics. His interest, however, shifted to the structure of biological macromolecules. Using X-ray diffraction Ramachandran along with Gopinath Kartha proposed and published the triple helical structure of collagen in 1954 in the journal Nature drawing worldwide scientific attention to the \\"Madras group\\". At Madras University, Professor Ramachandran was the favourite of the famous vice-chancellor and celebrated doctor and medical scientist, Sir Arcot Laksmanaswamy Mudaliar. Wanting to tackle problems at a more fundamental level, Ramachandran decided to use this information to examine the various polypeptide conformations then known and also to develop a good 'yardstick' that could be used for examining and assessing any structure in general, but peptides in particular. The result which emerged from these calculations in 1962, ‚Äì now commonly known as the Ramachandran plot ‚Äì was published in the Journal of Molecular Biology in 1963 and has become an essential tool in the field of protein conformation. When it was first calculated, crystal structures had barely been obtained for any protein. From the mid-1960s onward, Ramachandran studied many topics relating to the conformation of peptides including types of Œ≤-turns, conformation of prolyl residues, cis- peptide units, occurrence and need for non-planarity of the peptides, NMR coupling constants, peptides containing L and D residues and many others. He was awarded the prestigious Jawarharlal Nehru Fellowship in 1968 for research on Protein and Polypeptide Conformation, he was one of its first recipients. Ramachandran can be credited for bringing together into the one field of molecular biophysics the then disparate fields of X-ray crystallography, peptide synthesis, NMR and other optical studies, and physico-chemical experimentation. In 1970, he founded the Molecular Biophysics Unit at the Indian Institute of Science which was later known as the Centre of Advanced Study in Biophysics. In 1971, he moved to Bangalore owing to the deterioration in standards of the University of Madras after the long-term of Sir Arcot Lakshmanaswamy Mudaliar as the vice-chancellor. The general complaint was that the successor N.D. Sundaravadivelu could not sustain the academic standards of Sir A.L. Mudaliar. Ramachandran and A.V. Lakshminarayanan developed convolution-backprojection algorithms which greatly improved the quality and practicality of results obtainable by x-ray tomography. Compared to previously used methods, their algorithms considerably reduced computer processing time for image reconstruction, as well as providing more numerically accurate images. As a result, commercial manufacturers of x-ray tomographic scanners started building systems capable of reconstructing high resolution images that were almost photographically perfect. In 1971, they published their research in PNAS.Three-dimensional reconstructions from radiographs and electron micrographs: Application of convolution instead of Fourier Transforms, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., vol. 68, pp. 2236‚Äì2240, 1971 In 1981, Ramachandran became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. Notable awards that Ramachandran received include the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award for Physics in India (1961) and the Fellowship of the Royal Society of London. In 1999, the International Union of Crystallography honoured him with the Ewald Prize for his 'outstanding contributions to crystallography'. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize as well for his fundamental contributions in protein structure and function.  Later years  Ramachandran was devastated by the death of his wife Rajalakshmi in 1998, and a gradual deterioration in health occurred. During the last few years of his life he suffered a stroke and was affected by Parkinson's disease. Ramachandran died in 2001 at age 78, and left behind him a legacy of scientific discoveries. Leading scientists from Europe including Professor Linus Pauling and Professor Francis Crick regarded Professor Ramchandran as a Nobel Prize calibre scientist of great reputation.  Legacy  Each year, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) awards the \\"G N Ramachandran Gold Medal for Excellence in Biological Sciences & Technology\\" in his memory for work in Biological Sciences & Technology.

The size is too small and the castles at either end are missing. Colombo monument One of Santa Mar√≠as alleged anchors on display at Mus√©e du Panth√©on National Ha√Øtien Fort San Crist√≥bal, San Juan, Puerto Rico La Santa Mar√≠a (), alternatively La Gallega, was the largest of the three ships used by Christopher Columbus in his first voyage across the Atlantic Ocean in 1492, the others being the Ni√±a and the Pinta. Her master and owner was Juan de la Cosa, a man from Santo√±a, Cantabria, operating in south Spanish waters. Requisitioned by order of Queen Isabella and by contract with Christopher Columbus, whom de la Cosa knew previously, the Santa Maria became Columbus' flagship on the voyage as long as it was afloat. Having gone aground on Christmas Day, 1492, on the shores of Haiti, through inexperience of the helmsman, it was partially dismantled to obtain timbers for Fort Navidad, \\"Christmas Fort,\\" placed in a native Ta√≠no village. The fort was the first Spanish settlement in the New World, which Columbus had claimed for Spain. He thus regarded the wreck as providential. The hull remained where it was, the subject of much modern wreck-hunting without successful conclusion. On its return to Spain, the expedition was instantly an international success story. Columbus and his crews paraded the streets of Barcelona, on the way to be received by the queen, in the company of natives in gala native dress (mostly body paint) wearing ornaments of gold, now crown property. All the peccadillos of the formerly mutinous crews were forgiven and forgotten, except for obscure journal entries. As soon as was feasible the Queen launched an armada of 17 ships with settlers and troops for the relief of Fort Christmas and further solidification of Spanish power there. The Ni√±a and the Pinta sailed again. Columbus acquired a new flagship, believed, in the majority view, also to have been named the Santa Maria, but the sources give a few variants, such as the early Italian form, Marigalante. Juan de la Cosa was certainly on the second voyage although his status is somewhat uncertain. The majority view is that he had reconciled to Columbus and served again as the master of the Santa Maria, although perhaps not for the entire voyage. This time there was no grumbling and no mutinous talk or actions, as Columbus had at his command what were effectively royal marines. The second expedition arrived at Fort Christmas, anchoring carefully away from the sandbar. They found the fort burned and abandoned. A few corpses of Europeans lay nearby. The chief of the Taino admitted the colonists were all dead, slain by the Taino natives. The chief denied complicity, claiming a wound inflicted in their defense. Subsequent investigation failed to clear him. The shock altered Columbus' perception of his mission. Formerly he had respected the natives, even the ones taken into custody. Now he disrespected them, against the express orders of the queen.Hale takes the point of view without evidence that Columbus was corrupted by the neer-do-well sons of the wealthy, whom he was forced to include in his company, and that he was \\"dragged down from his noble position.\\" The outcome was a policy of enslavement and genocide, for which he was ultimately courtmartialed, convicted, and enjoined from further \\"colonial\\" activities, including removal from his hereditary offices.  The name and provenience of the Santa Maria  There is less certainty about its name than for the other two ship.s Columbus' Journal of NavigationThis is the document called by some writers \\"the Diary,\\" but it was not a personal diary. The naval protocol was for all commanding officers to keep logs of day-to-day events. for the first voyage frequently refers to the Pinta and the Nina by name, and often asserts that they were caravels, but it never refers to the flagship by name. The surviving journal may contain flaws. The original journal, sent to the monarchs of Spain, did not survive, but an abstract (full of errors) by the historian, Bartolom√© de las Casas, did. The historians offer two names: Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de Oviedo y Vald√©s calls it Gallega; Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, Santa Maria. One solution to the conundrum is that the ship began under de la Cosa as Gallega and was changed by Columbus to Santa Maria, but there are other theories as well. Moreover, \\"la Gallega\\" can be taken as \\"the Galician,\\" suggesting that the ship was constructed in that province and was named after it. In the absence of proof, scholars can only speculate. C.E. Nowell remarked: > \\"There is a lunatic fringe of writers determined to establish far-fetched > theories regarding the Columbus enterprise or to prove that the discoverer > was of some nationality hitherto unsuspected.\\" = Master of the Santa Maria = Columbus encountered Juan de la Cosa apparently by accident in the port of Palos de la FronteraThe main sources that cover the topic concur that de la Cosa happened to be in the port when Columbus was making his selection. For example: \\"...the said nao Santa Mar√≠a, being in the waters of the County of Niebla (probably in the port of Huelva) when the fleet for the Columbus exped√≠tion was being organized, Columbus was struck with her, and, at once entered into treaties with her owner and captain, Juan de la Cosa, for employing her in his expedition of discovery, with the condition of being allowed to hoist his Ensign of Admiral on her mast head.\\" Huelva is across the Rio Tinto from Palos. (circumstances moved so quickly with such unexpected result as to preclude any pre-arrangement between Columbus and de la Cosa; see below), the point of embarkation for the yet undiscovered New World. De la Cosa was a professional master, navigator, and entrepreneur. His assistance would turn out to be a sine qua non-of the voyages of Columbus, and yet, due to the self-aggrandizement of Columbus in his journal, \\"...one of the great defects in the character of Columbus being that he could not suffer any one to shine in his presence.\\" and its revision and continuation by his son, de la Cosa remains a shadowy figure, except for the contribution for which he is best known, the earliest known surviving map of the New World.  The problem of the identity of Juan de la Cosa  In early May 1492, Columbus, a newly appointed admiral in the royal navy, \\"... the capitulation, prepared by the secretary, Juan de Coloma, was signed at Santa Fe by their Highnesses on 17 April 1492. In return for his discoveries, Columbus was created Admiral of the Ocean in all those islands and continents that he might discover. The title was granted to him for his life, and to his heirs for ever....\\" and entourage show up at the port of Palos under orders from the queen to conduct an expedition westward looking for a route to the Indies. He carries with him also orders to the port authorities to impress a squadron of three caravels with supplies and crews, who thereafter would serve in the navy at regular seaman's pay. Two of the caravels were to be selected by the port authorities. They impressed the Nina and the Pinta, quite small caravels with a single deck each. The third was left up to Columbus to select. The mission and the orders were unpopular. \\"On the 23rd of May, Columbus went to the church of San Giorgio in Palos, with ... important people, and the royal order was read with great solemnity. But it excited at first only indignation or dismay. The expedition was most unpopular. Sailors refused to enlist, and the authorities, who had already offended the crown, so that they had to furnish these vessels, as it were, as a fine, refused to do what they were bidden.\\" The resistance of the town in every quarter extended the time required to obtain compliance. Given 10 days by the orders, they took 10 weeks. According to De la Riega, the general consensus of the late 19th century (still considered true today) was that \\"there was no time or money to go from port to port examining ships ....\\" No habia tiempo ni sobraba dinero para ir de puerto en puerto examinando buques .... Columbus necessarily chose a ship available in port, the nao Santa Maria/Gallega, with, presumably, the additional advantage of Juan de la Cosa as captain, a famous navigator and geographer. There was then only one nao to which the names applied (in whatever sequence), and not two. =Mutiny on the Santa Maria= The relationship between Columbus and de la Cosa (hereinafter referenced as \\"the admiral\\" and \\"the captain\\", as they are in the journal) was problematic. The same problem was true of the other two ships; even though all had agreed to sail voluntarily (but unwillingly and with bad grace), the complaints and the non-cooperation, now called mutiny, continued. Aboard the Santa Maria, as both the admiral and the captain were in the service of the Crown, the admiral had the rank. The ship-handling, however, was supposed to be the province of the captain. This protocol had been established in the very first Roman fleet, and, like the protocols of the Roman army, had prevailed in all the fleets of the countries descending from the Roman Empire. In any fleet, or its diminutive flotilla, or squadron, the commander of all the ships reported to the central government and held the position of admiral, regardless of any other social or military rank he may have had. The commander of any one ship was its magister, or \\"master;\\" that is, the captain, or \\"head.\\" He ran the ship, only providing an office for the admiral, and receiving from him the same orders as the other captains. This relationship must prevail until the ship was officially detached from the flotilla. The journal reveals that in the first voyage these relationships were never settled. Columbus often overstepped his province and the masters with their men often disobeyed. For example, on the homeward leg, when Columbus is commanding the remaining two ships from the Nina, he is so uncomfortable that he wishes to rush home to bring matters before the queen, reported in this quote from Columbus: > I will not suffer the deeds of evil-disposed persons, with little worth, > who, without respect for him to whom they owe their positions, presume to > set up their own wills with little ceremony. When the ship was finally lost off Haiti, the captain refused to follow the admiral's plan for extracting the ship from the sandbank and instead sought help from the Nina. The admiral accused him of treason and desertion in the face of danger, For example, \\"If it had not been for the treachery of the master and his boat's crew, who were all or mostly his countrymen (Cantabrians, some basques, who had been in the previous crew), in neglecting to lay out the anchor so as to haul the ship off in obedience to the Admiral's orders, she would have been saved.\\" serious charges, for which defendants have received the death penalty. Judging by the vituperation in the journal, one might expect to read of some sort of court martial or attempted court martial at home afterward. There is no record of any such proceedings. Moreover, the Life of Columbus by his son, who surely possessed Columbus' journal. is strangely lacking in references to Juan de la Cosa by name. Even in the shipwrecking incident, the son reports only that > Very soon the ship's master, whose watch it was, ran up ... Here the admiral is being portrayed as the captain of the ship, while \\"the master\\" evidently is reduced in rank to an ordinary seaman. Real captains, unless in a vessel much smaller than the nao, do not stand watch (the men on active duty), which reports to the captain (or should report). If Columbus is commanding the ship, apparently his master has nothing to do.One explanation postulates a conflict in social roles: \\"Certainly Juan de la Cosa as a master should have been on his guard and not allow the helmsman to give the helm to a novice, as he seems to indicate in his \\"Diary.\\" But Barreiro-Meiro comes out in defense of the Cantabrian, noting that there was more than one master (m√°s de un maestre) in the nao and that it was not La Cosa that was performing at that time. . He is not even worthy of a name. This is where the irreconcilable contradictions in the evidence begin. Columbus obliterates Juan de la Cosa from his records. =The heroic disgrace= The proof of his existence and his status is given in a conciliatory letter from the crown to the man over a year later, on 28 February 1494, which is phrased in the form of a judgement at the end of an unrecorded process: > D. Fernando and Do√±a Isabel ... Salutations and thanks to you Juan de la > Cosa, resident (vesino) of Santa Maria del Puerto, you have given us good > service and we hope that you will help us from now on.

The journal portrays a mutinous shipmaster who had refused duty, had disobeyed orders, and had lost the ship. Now the admiral was on the way to seek military justice from the sovereign. However, the first account of the sovereign's response gives no hint of any such violations. Pery says: > ... the Royal Decree of February 28, 1494, does not seem made for anyone > disgraced ... (it) has no turning point: a man who disgraces himself by > losing a ship ... cannot be paid for the ship ... the aforementioned letter > makes us think that ... the story of events is one of many added by Father > Las Casas ... =Too many places at once= There are a number of other logical difficulties with this now isolated legal document; that is, its participants no doubt knew what they meant by its terms, but not enough knowledge of the circumstances survives to clarify their meaning. For example, does \\"una nao vuestra\\" imply that Juan de la Cosa had more than one ship of which the crown impressed one? In either case de la Cosa is clearly an entrepreneur or he would not be interested in transporting grain to sell. But if he had only one ship, and that was lost, how was he to transport the grain? Worse, Columbus had already left for his second voyage. There is strong evidence that de la Cosa was a member of it and therefore was not even in Spain when the letter addressed to him was published by the court. These difficulties are sufficient to have resulted in the proposition that there were two Juan de la Cosa's, one a master and entrepreneur, and the other a cartographer (see below). There is additional evidence as to the location of \\"Santa Maria del Puerto,\\" of which de la Cosa is stated to have been its vesino.Vecino or vesino is a uniquely Spanish reflex of Latin vicinus, a resident of a vicus, a specific community. It retains the \\"neighbor\\" implication of a \\"neighborhood\\" not present in English resident, citizen, or inhabitant. Vesinos were typically intensely loyal to each other and to the vicus. In time Roman vici grew to urban proportions. Not stated is whether it was his native community, or he moved there from elsewhere, or whether his company was located there, or his ships constructed and harbored there. Fortuitously a contemporary letter of the queen gives evidence as to its location, today considered most probable. The letter addresses Juan Rodr√≠guez de Fonseca, the Bishop of Badajoz and royal officer managing the fleet. It is dated 25 August 1496, one month after the return of the fleet. It informs the Bishop that Juan de la Cosa, a vesino of Puerto de Santonia, had petitioned the crown for payment of salary accrued to men who had died in the service of the queen, presumably to be distributed to the relatives. \\"De todos estos documentos se deduce que Juan de la Cosa se embarc√≥ en el segundo viaje de Col√≥n, escogido por √©ste como h√°bil piloto y perito navegante. Recorri√≥, pues, la isla de Cuba y la bah√≠a de Saman√°, y en 1496 volvi√≥ √° Espa√±a y se retir√≥ √° Santo√±a, como consta por una carta de la Reina Do√±a Isabel, fechada en Laredo √° 25 de Agosto de 1496, y dirigida al Obispo de Badajoz, en que habla de una petici√≥n de Juan de la Cosa, ¬´vecino de Santo√±a¬ª,a mandando que se pagasen sus alcances √° los que fallecieron en las Indias en el servicio real.\\" If de la Cosa went on the second voyage, he must have been a vesino of Santa Maria del Puerto when the queen was considering his petition for compensation for his ship. As he did not move while at sea and he was a vesino of Santo√±a within a month of his return, Santa Maria del Puerto and Santo√±a must be the same place, more or less, justifying the hypothesis that Santa Maria del Puerto is a prior name of Santo√±a. The etymology of the name is believed to be as follows: an object, \\"Santa Maria,\\" is being stated to be in a place called Puerto. Fortuitously a single reference from a classical author provides a likely identification of Puerto. =Juan Vizcaino comes to light= An ancestral home in Santo√±a and vicinity is supported by other evidence. There is a church in the vicinity, Santa Maria del Puerto, which once must have had a parish. No parish records concerning Juan have been identified, but the deficit can be explained by known fires over the centuries. There is a district named after the de la Cosa family, who were noble patrons of the neighborhood,However, all Basque families had the rights and privileges of nobility, which was the price paid by the crown of Castille for their support. and there was also a reputed family home. The de la Cosas were prosperous mariners, explaining how Juan might have gotten the Santa Maria (but different theories have been proposed). In any case the high proportion of Cantabrians in the crew supports the theory. The name, de la Cosa, is consistent with the conventions of forming Spanish names from Basque names. The \\"de\\" was prefixed to the name as a sign of their legal nobility. It did not refer to a patronym, as in Indo-European, or to a place. The remaining part of the name was a Basque name, formed according to the conventions of the Basque language. Juan's Basque name is cited in other publications of the times as Lacoza, Lakotsa, Lakotya, La Cosa, and Lakoza. An alternative is Juan Vizca√≠no, \\"John the Basque.\\" Was the historical Juan de la Cosa one man or two? The evidence concerning Juan de la Cosa is divided in two, an early, poorly attested period up to the missing turning point mentioned by Pery (above), in which he is a shipmaster and entrepreneur, and a later, well attested explorer serving in many senior roles: navigator, cartographer, master and consultant, who continued to sail with Columbus and also with other explorers such as Amerigo Vespucci. His is the earliest known surviving map of the new world. This bold explorer was killed by a poisoned arrow in a Custer-like raid on the natives, whom the Spanish had, evidently, underestimated. The early history of the Santa Maria belongs to the early phase. =The map= Reproduction of mappa mundi, Cultural Center, Puerto de Santa Maria The most certain evidence of Juan de la Cosa, cartographer, is a world map on parchment discovered in 1832, now in the Museo Naval in Madrid. The map bears the inscription: :Juan de la cosa la fizo en el puerto de S: ma en a√±o de 1500 which can be translated :Juan de la Cosa made it in the port of Santa Maria in the year 1500 \\"Puerto de Santa Maria\\" is not the same place as \\"Santa Maria del Puerto.\\" In the former case, the Puerto is named Santa Maria. In the latter case the community of Santa Maria is located within the terrain called Puerto. The minority view regards them as variants, perhaps by error, of the name of the same place, but the majority view regards the former as a port near C√°diz in Andalusia famous for its role in New World exploration. Regardless of whether Santa Maria is one place or two, Santona can still figure as Juan's birthplace. In either case, how Juan arrived at Andalusia from Cantabria is a gap, one explanation being that there were two Juan's from Santona, but even that explanation requires a move. The authenticity of the map has always been in question, especially since much of it is illegible to the unaided eye due to its dilapidated condition. Multispectral analysis, however, has brought out sufficient detail to perform cartographic and geographic analyses upon it, which are ongoing, and have been and are being published in a large variety of sources, many of them graphic. This article relies mainly on the summary given by Arthur Davies, who developed his theses in different articles and came to work up a standard summary. Exploration in the late 15th century was in the hands of a small class of veteran mariners, such as Columbus, de la Cosa, Vespucci, Cabot (another Genoese), and not a few others. History has dubbed these men and their companions Conquistadores from the later historical results, but it is unlikely that they viewed themselves as such in Columbus' time, being mainly interested in trade, gold, and colonization. Conquest is what they finally had to do to accomplish those goals in the lands of the natives. The resources for their explorations were provided by the monarchs of the major maritime countries: Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, John II of Portugal and his successor, Manuel I of Portugal, and Henry VII of England. These monarchs in particular made exploration and possession of the New World their main preoccupation. They often allocated unlimited funding to the expeditions. The professional mariners had to be first of all skilled ship captains. Second, they had to be able to navigate and be familiar with charts (a trade word for marine maps). Unlike today's navigators, who rely on admiralty charts and GPS's to determine position within a few feet, 15th century mariners made their own charts during exploration of unknown lands, the \\"Portolan charts,\\" from which subsequent sailors to the region would take sailing directions. These were promulgated freely among the mariners, in contrast to the classical protocols of secrecy. The monarchs, who had formulated treaties among themselves, needed to know as quickly as possible who had discovered and claimed what land masses, and when.Hale covers many of the treaties, underscoring the attempted use, by these Catholic kings, of the Pope to lend authority to their proposed lines of demarcation. . The discovery was entirely Catholic. Henry VIII, founder of English protestantism, had yet to sit on the throne. In Columbus' times, the ad hoc portolans were brought back to the office of the chief navigator (whether captain or some other officer) where they were transferred to a mappa mundi, \\"world map.\\" This latter was on view to any professional who visited the office. The mariners all knew each other. When not voyaging they visited each other to donate their own data and read the latest data from the mappa kept there. The development of the latest maps was their common cause, otherwise they continued to compete. That Juan de la Cosa had his own office at Puerto de Santa Maria is thus made certain by the surviving map, published in 1500 under his name. That he did not himself draw the mappa is shown by the names assigned places on coasts he visited, and had a major hand in the nomenclature, such as the coast of Venezuela in 1499, but appear garbled or incomprehensible on the map, which must be attributed to a draftsman. De la Cosa knew what names he had assigned. That he supervised work on the mappa is shown by the fact that he wrote instructions on it concerning the data that was to appear there. este cavo se descubrio en ano de mil y CCCC XC IX por castilla syendo descubridor vicentians this cape was discovered in the year of 1499 by Castile being the discoverer Vicente Y√°√±ez The publication date of the mappa is substantiated by the data that appears upon it. Landforms east of the Amazon were discovered by Vicente Pinzon, 1499 ‚Äì 1500. Their appearance on the mappa must be dated to after September 1500, when he returned. He lost no time in visiting Juan de la Cosa's office, which must have been there on the port's harbor. That de la Cosa relied on Pinzon is shown by his map note that a certain cape was discovered by Pinzon in 1499. On the other hand, no data from discoveries made after 1500 appear on the map. It may therefore be dated to October ‚Äì December 1500. Amerigo Vespucci visited de la Cosa's office in 1500, probably to report data on coasts he had explored. In October, Rodrigo de Bastidas, another seasoned explorer, departed for the New World at the pleasure of the queen. His charter lists Juan de la Cosa and Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa as members. This is when de la Cosa left his instructions on the mappa. Vespucci is likely to have been left in charge, as, invited to Portugal to confer with its king about an unknown urgent matter, he felt free to bring along the map, as the Portuguese monarch had suggested. Once there, Vespucci was made an offer he did not refuse, to command a new expedition to Brazil, ready and waiting for him. The result was the discovery and claiming of Brazil for Portugal. De la Cosa arrived at Lisbon in 1503 on the trail of the map. On making inquiries he was promptly arrested, a hypocritical act, as the monarch knew perfectly well whose map it was. By this time the information had been copied. On negotiation Vespucci agreed to present the map to Isabella. No further additions had been made or would be made; it was strictly a historical and ornamental object, and was already out of date. From these attested facts it is clear that de la Cosa, cartographer, maintained an office in Andalusia at Puerto de Santa Maria near Cadiz, where his mappa mundi was kept on display, and that he led a band of employees who maintained the map and kept the office while he was away on expedition. This status is not inconsistent with a role as entrepreneur. =The letter of Dr. Chanca= Columbus' second voyage began on 25 September 1493, with the departure of a 17-ship armada from Cadiz under the command of the Admiral. As for the first voyage, the admiral was required to keep a log, but it also has been lost. Summaries of parts of it survive in his son's biography, and briefly in some other sources. The most extensive account, however, is from a totally independent source, the letter of Dr. Diego √Ålvarez Chanca to the Council of Seville, of which he was a vesino. Dr. Chanca was the fleet surgeon, appointed by the queen. He wrote from the field, sending the post with Antonio de Torres, who was sailing back to Spain with news and requests. Apart from the doctor's personal business in Seville, his letter is highly anthropological, giving a cultural view of the natives. With regard to the history of the voyage he says nearly nothing, but the turn of events revealed by the biography and a letter of Columbus posing as a \\"memorial\\" (see below) stands in sharp contrast to his optimism. We are, so to speak, being treated to the doctor's bedside manner, the patient being far from healthy. Of events before the departure, little survives, but the biography supplies some detail. The \\"turning point\\" mentioned by Pery (above) is not entirely absent. The first fleet returned to Palos (all two ships) and there received instructions to report to the royals at Barcelona. Nothing is said of de la Cosa. Mart√≠n Alonso Pinz√≥n, captain of the renegade ship, the Pinta, which had gone off on its own hunting for gold, feeling guilty over the report he knew Columbus was going to make, stopped first in Galicia to send a request via messenger for a private audience with the royals. The playing field was no longer level, however. The pope had weighed in, approving the exploration, and setting lines of demarcation. Rejected, and ordered not to come to Barcelona except in the company of Columbus, a dejected Pinzon went home to Palos to die there of illness caused by hardship on the voyage. Whether he would have faced charges at Barcelona remains to be seen. He would have faced the glorification of Columbus. Previously, on 30 April 1492, the latter had been made a Don, with the title of \\"Admiral of the Ocean Sea.\\" On 28 May 1493, the status was confirmed, with the addition of the Pope's approval. In June Columbus arrived in Seville with a license to collect a fleet, in the same way, no doubt, as he had at Palos. As the fleet departed in September, there was not enough time to build one; i.e., Columbus or his agents commandeered ships, leasing them from the owners. This status did not make them a private navy, as are privateers, since the personnel were in the royal navy and were being paid ultimately by the queen (next section). The biography says \\"... in a short time he had made ready seventeen ships, large and small, well stocked and carrying all the things and persons needed to settle those lands ....\\" This statement condensed is often used to fill in a gap in Dr. Chanca's letter, although the doctor cannot be proved to have said it. Volunteers flocked to the standard from all walks of life, many willing to serve without pay. Columbus chose 1500 he thought would be the most useful. Unknown to him, trouble was already brewing beneath the surface, as was revealed in a crisis and was published in the \\"Memorial.\\" Given new arms and armor, the soldiers sold them in Seville and kept the old and antiquated. The fine cavalry horses also were sold and replaced with nags. These ad hoc marines obviously expected no combat. The contractors were at work shorting provisions: the casks supplied were not watertight and the wine they carried leaked away; the salt beef was short and in poor condition; foodstuffs required for cooking were missing, having been sold off elsewhere. Later the queen would swoop among the contractors like an avenging angel, but for now provisions and equipment would appear to be adequate. The fleet, considered prepared, having assembled at Cadiz, departed from there, the admiral commanding, on 25 September 1493. The weather being unusually good, they sighted the New World again on 3 November, Dr. Cnanca complaining that \\"la noa Capitana\\" (flagship) was slower and had slowed them down. At dawn on the 3rd \\"un piloto de la nao Capitana,\\" spied land, claiming the reward for that event. The numerous navigators (pilotos) on board argued over the distance from Spain. The doctor quipped, he was not one who had not seen enough water. The day was Sunday. The land spied was an island. As the dawn brightened another appeared, and then four more. Chanca does not refer to them by name; it is always a relative position: \\"the first seen\\", \\"the second seen\\", and so on. Some editions include the names dubbed in from the Biography. At the time Chanca wrote, the names were not known or not assigned. In fact Columbus had overshot Hispaniola to the southeast and was picking his way among the Lesser Antilles in the vicinity of Guadeloupe. He knew where he was roughly. All the ship captains had received instructions how to get to Navidad in case they were separated. Those were sealed until required, if ever. The point of this nicety remains obscure, as there was no one to spy out the secret who would not shortly know all. The Biography says that the admiral named the first island seen Domenica, because discovered on Sunday. He named the second Marigalante after the ship. As the only extant edition of the original Biography is a translation of the Spanish into Tuscan, called Italian on the title page, by Alfonso Ulloa (Basque name), The translation notice on the 1571 edition is: Nuovamente di lingua Spagnuola tradotte nell‚ÄôItaliana dal S. Alfonso Ulloa, ‚ÄúNewly translated from the Spanish language into Italian by Se√±or Alfonso Ulloa.‚Äù The Spanish manuscript, which was not otherwise published, is lost. the names in it cannot be assumed to be either Spanish or not Spanish unless so indicated by Ulloa. Whatever the origin, the name stayed with the island in western maps and writings, even though the Spanish did not settle there. It was occupied by the French in 1648, to whom it became Marie- Galante, a Frenchification of a presumed compound, Mari-Galante, \\"Gallant Mary.\\" Whether in Italian or French, Galante is the same as English gallant. The application is totally speculative. Saint Mary, if that is the person referenced by the name, is a figure of reverence, not an adventuress, and could not be called the latter without an insult to the religion. Anyone who dared such a meaning in those times would not be alive for much longer; men were burned for less. Only modern pagan writers far from the fires of Inquisition might suggest that under the very noses of the authors of the Inquisition, the Don and Dona of Spain, and the staunchest advocates of Catholicism, Columbus, Juan de la Cosa and all his Basque countrymen, who were indispensable to the expedition, the patron saint of the expedition and the entire new Spanish Empire could be so insulted by a salacious ship name, and the same can be said of those who postulate salacious overtones for the Nina and Pinta. The 1571 Italian text of the Biography is: > ... traversarano ad un'altra isola, a cui l'Ammiraglio pose nome > Marigalante, per hauer la nave Capitana tal nome ... =The \\"Memorial\\" letter of Columbus= The admiral had planned to settle Navidad further, a goal he still had when he anchored before the sand bar on the last night at sea. On making the shocking discovery the next day that it no longer existed and the Europeans were all dead, massacred by the natives, he changed his mind, responding to the new military dimension of the affair. He explored further along the coast looking for a defensible site with a good harbor. He found it at La Isabela, named after the queen, currently a historic park in the Dominican Republic, about 110 miles from Cap-Haitien, Haiti, a city close to the location of Navidad. According to Dr. Chanca, the criteria were \\"an excellent harbor and abundance of fish.\\" The site was defensible: the top of a ravine overlooking the Isabela River further defended by an impassible thicket of trees. The soil was so fertile that it grew an abundance of vegetables, especially the yam, in only 8 days. A landing was made 8 days before Christmas, 1493, about 3 months after the expedition had left port in Spain. Exploring parties were sent out to investigate native reports of gold in the hills. One found it in over 50 streams. Other evidence suggests that the real circumstances were not so rosy as the sanguine doctor decided to portray; in fact, the opportunity to send letters was based on dire need. On 2 February 1494, a return fleet of 12 ships was dispatched to Spain under Antonio de Torres, ostensibly to report the news, but more pointedly to ask for emergency assistance. One third of his men were ill, he said, from eating and drinking native food and water. The doctor was working day and night. The men were still in huts built native-style, or else on the ships. Columbus alone had a stone, European-style house. Stone walls had been started, but the natives moved freely among them. The Europeans were in continual fear of a surprise attack, despite posting sentries. Would the sovereigns send immediately additional professionals and medical supplies along with decent European food, etc. No gold could be mined without the augment. Columbus did not ask directly. Instead he fabricated the excuse that he was instructing de Torres about what to put in a \\"memorial,\\" or factual white paper, he was to formulate ad hoc and present to the sovereigns. This ruse fooled no one. De Torres passed it on to the sovereigns and they wrote their comments in the margins. Those comments were entirely supportive, and he was given almost everything he asked for. The one exception was his request to convert some of the relief ships to slavers. He would capture some Carribs, put them aboard ships used to bring horses and other animals to the island, and transport them to Spain, where they would be converted, educated out of their man-eating, body-painting ways, and sold at the block to recoup the cost. The queen took this type of suggestion under further advisement, but her doing so did not appear to deter Columbus from enslaving the natives. The relief was dispatched immediately, undoubtedly in all or some of the same twelve caravels. The letters from this phase divulge more information about the ships.  The major ports of the newly united 15th century Spain  The Atlantic coast of Iberia is divided between Spain and Portugal, but the coast of Portugal divides the Spanish coast. Spain and Portugal were intense competitors for any sort of maritime business and in the discovery and settlement of the New World. The staging ground for Spanish exploration was mainly the Atlantic coast of Andalusia, recently captured from the Moors in the 15th century. Northward from Andalusia was Portugal, and north of it Galicia. Its ports and ships served the northern trade routes. The ships were heavier to withstand the winter seas. On the western side of the northern coast of Iberia (eastward of Galicia) were Asturias and Cantabria, mountainous regions except for a coastal strip, occupied by a population speaking a Romance language. The east was given to the Basques, native Euskaldunak, a quasi-autonomous people speaking their own language, native Euskera, unrelated to any other.The Greco- Roman civilization knew the Basques as the Vascones, in which Eusk- becomes Vasc-. From the Roman form came \\"Basque\\", \\"Biscay,\\" and \\"Gascon.\\" Unable to maintain their own country, Basque-speakers formed a sort of quasi-hidden brotherhood in the cultures in which they participated, such as the Spanish explorations of the New World. Ordinary working Basques spoke no Spanish. The educated and professional classes were bilingual. They necessarily used Spanish in business, as Basque was not written for ordinary purposes (a few Basque authors began to appear in the 15th century). Their names were converted to Spanish according to rule. Under these Spanish names they made large contributions of manpower to the exploration and settlement of the New World. In the 15th century they were unswervingly loyal to Ferdinand and Isabella, and they to them. The Atlantic coasts of Iberia being mainly mountainous, the cities and shipyards are on bays and the rivers that, draining the highlands, empty into them. The Roman word for one of these bays, or harbors, is portus, \\"throughway,\\" closely related to porta, \\"gate.\\" The concept survives in modern languages as \\"the gateway\\" to some region. Portus became puerto in Spanish. English speakers know it simply as port. The Romans further qualified portus with another name in the genitive case, which over the centuries was lost, leaving just puerto in Spain, but the Spanish followed the Roman custom by assigning a name after de. =Euskal Herria= \\"Basque Country\\" is a semi-political community based on ethnicity. At the uppermost levels of loyalty and identity it is not a legal structure at all. There is no nation of the Basques. Basque Country is divided between two sovereign nations,Spain and France, in which it is called informally \\"Southern Basque Country\\" (Basque Hegoalde) and \\"Northern Basque Country\\" (Basque Iparralde) respectively. Within each of these a formal provincial structure applies. Iparralde contains Lapurdi, Behe Nafarroa, and Zuberoa. Hegoalde contains Nafarroa, Bizkaia, Araba, and Gipuzkoa (the spellings may vary in the transliterations into different languages). The provenience of these names is mainly unknown, except that they are ancient. In modern times, by the Spanish 1979 Statute of Autonomy, Bizkaia, Araba, and Gipuzkoa are combined into the Basque Autonomous Community, calling itself Euskadi. Nafarroa is its own Autonomous Community. = The Pontevedra theory = In 1897 Celso Garc√≠a de la Riega published a book specifically about Columbus' flagship, La Gallega, Nave Capitana De Col√≥n: Primer Viaje De Descubrimientos, English \\"The Gallego, Command Ship of Columbus in the First Voyage of Discovery.\\" It was dedicated to \\"The People of Pontevedra,\\" > whose name God has wanted to link to that of the caravel 'La Gallega', from > whose castle Columbus saw ... the revealing light of a new world. He was being financed by a factory owner of Pontevedra. He also expressed that he wanted to build the confidence of the people so that they might work to restore the prosperity of old. These motives were nothing like the objectivity demanded of today's scholars, but the book was popular right from its first publication. His thesis was that the Gallega had to have been constructed in Pontevedra, Galicia, in Spain's North-West region. at a time when it was a port and was at the peak of its prosperity. De la Riega begins with the generally accepted circumstances of Columbus' departure from Spain, which he also accepts.  Design of the ship  Santa Mar√≠a was probably a medium-sized nau (carrack), about long on deck, and according to Juan Escalante de Mendoza in 1575, Santa Maria was \\"very little larger than 100 toneladas\\" (about 100 tons, or tuns) burthen, or burden, and was used as the flagship for the expedition. Santa Mar√≠a had a single deck and three small masts. The other ships of the Columbus expedition were the smaller caravel-type ships Santa Clara (known as La Ni√±a (\\"The Girl\\")), and La Pinta (\\"The Painted\\"). All these ships were second-hand (if not third- or more) and were not intended for exploration. Ni√±a, Pinta, and the Santa Mar√≠a were modest-sized merchant vessels comparable in size to a modern cruising yacht. The exact measurements of length and width of the three ships have not survived, but good estimates of their burden capacity can be judged from contemporary anecdotes written down by one or more of Columbus's crew members, and contemporary Spanish and Portuguese shipwrecks from the late 15th and early 16th centuries which are comparable in size to that of Santa Mar√≠a. These include the ballast piles and keel lengths of the Molasses Reef Wreck and Highborn Cay Wreck in the Bahamas. Both were caravel vessels in length overall, keel length and in width, and rated between 100 and 150 tons burden. Santa Mar√≠a, being Columbus' largest ship, was only about this size, and Ni√±a and Pinta were smaller, at only 50 to 75 tons burden and perhaps on deck (updated dimensional estimates are discussed below in the section entitled Replicas).  History of the first voyage  =At the pleasure of the queen = On 2 January 1492, the last remaining Moslem stronghold in Spain, Granada, fell to the armies of the Catholic monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella. They began making changes in the direction of cultural unity. The Moslems were encouraged to leave for North Africa. The Jews were given a choice: convert to Catholicism or leave the country (a dictate that led to the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain).The actual decree was the Edict of Expulsion, dated 31 March 1492, now called the Alhambra Decree. The Spanish Inquisition had already been instituted in 1478 to detect hypocrisy. Roman methods of interrogation were still in effect, which always involved torture, even if the suspect began by confessing everything. As the New Christians (so they were called), were never arrested unless already convicted in public belief, the outcome was almost always some form of burning, dead (if already executed) or alive, although individual expulsion was sometimes used. Sometimes all conversos in a region were declared heretic and were automatically tortured and killed. The treatment of the Jews at that time was complex and far from rational, as the author analyzes. As Columbus and his friends were never under any suspicion of being marranos, and were totally trusted by the king and queen, it is unlikely that they could have proceeded with the expedition if in any way caught up in the web of conspiracy against Moors and Jews. The Jews who converted, called conversos, were often welcomed into high places with open arms, so to speak. The Grand Inquisitor himself, Tom√°s de Torquemada, was of a converso family. On the other hand, those who professed Catholicism, but practiced or seemed to practice Crypto-Judaism, were called Marranos. These lived a life of terrible fear and secrecy. In the conclusion of their affairs at Granada the monarchs dismissed Christopher Columbus, who had been at their court for 6.5 years petitioning for support for an expedition to discover a great circle route to the far east (\\"regions of India,\\" in English \\"Indies\\"), which would entail a voyage due west over the deep and unknown ocean. Ferdinand cites as another reason the desire to find new lands, which the great distance led him to suspect were there.There is thus no need to hypothesize some prior knowledge of them on his part. There were, however, persistent stories of land to west of the Azores, which Christopher, after investigation, discounted. Ferdinand knew one of them as \\"the land of cod\\" (page 27). Paying him for his time and trouble, they dismissed him and his suite for good and all, they thought. They had nothing against his being Italian,Strictly speaking, there was no Italy and no Italian until Giuseppe Garibaldi unified Italy in the 19th century. In the centuries since the fall of Rome, Italy had become several states speaking different Romance languages. There was, however, a universal popular desire to re-create a single country. Tuscan, considered the purest Romance language, became the basis for a new Standard Italian. Tuscan had already been called Italian by the literate classes for a number of centuries; however, most people were not literate. Tuscan was not genrally spoken outside Tuscany. In the 15th century, the Columbus family was Genoese; that is, they resided in the Republic of Genoa and spoke the Genoese dialect of Ligurian. All arguments based on the \\"Italian\\" or \\"Spanish\\" of Columbus are anachronistic, as he did not live in the modern world or speak any of its languages. as he professed Catholicism also, but their Spanish advisors had condemned the idea as unprofitable. No sooner had he departed from nearby Santa Fe, the temporary capital, than Luis de Sant√°ngel, a converso in the position of royal treasurer, and some other friends of Columbus, convinced the queen that great risks could bring great profits at a minimal cost on this expedition.There is the question of why de Sant√°ngel should be so trusted when so many conversos were being arrested on suspicion of being marranos. Markham asserts that Columbus fought with the army before Granada in 1492. The royals were thus inclined to trust and reward him if they could. Columbus was summoned from the road only four miles away and was unexpectedly given the support he had been denied all this time along with command of the expedition and the permanent rank of admiral and governor of all lands he should acquire. He was to receive 10% of all portable valuables he would acquire, but not until he had acquired them. Meanwhile, the queen would stand the expenses, for which she said she would pledge her jewels for collateral, if necessary (it was apparently not necessary). The only way to understand a head of state being privately indebted for public enterprises, or having to pawn personal property, is to turn back the clock in the evolution of modern states. There were no departments or agencies staffed by professionals who for the most part carry on without the immediate supervision of the head of state. Fort Knox, so to speak, was non-existent. In 15th century Spain and other European monarchies the sovereign presided over every state enterprise. The operational expenses were covered in advance by loans to the sovereign or persons designated by the sovereign. The sources of the loans were generally customary. The backers were happy to do that for an agreed interest. The revenue to pay off specific loans came from the exercise of governmental prerogatives: taxes, tariffs, fines, fees, etc. The sovereign presided over the imposition of these obligations. They were collected, however, by private enterprises, as they had been in Roman times. Thus, the promise of Isabella to pay was really the assertion that she would create an obligation for her subjects to pay. Meanwhile, she had to conform to the protocols for borrowing money, such as putting up collateral. Possession of such collateral would never be demanded. The jewels were never at risk. The voyage was principally financed by a syndicate of seven noble Genovese bankers resident in Seville (the group was linked to Amerigo Vespucci and funds belonging to Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de Medici). Hence, all the accounting and recording of the voyage was kept in Seville. This also applies to the second voyage, even though the syndicate had by then disbanded. = Cuba and Hispaniola = According to a glowing letter sent by Columbus to his chief supporter, Luis de Sant√°ngel, in February 1493, from the Canary Islands, Cuba was the 5th island renamed by him, its new name being Juana. This time the name did not prevail over the native name, Cuba. However, Columbus' order is a simplification. He visited many more small islands, investigating everything everywhere. Striking the north coast of Cuba, he sailed westward, going around the west end of the island. Then he sailed eastward and southward. Clinging to the belief that he was in the Far East, he at first supposed he was off Cipango, Portuguese name for \\"Japan,\\" which supposition was recorded in the journal. By the time of the letter, he had changed it to Cathay, or China. While skimming the coast of Cuba from bay to bay, the ships were visited by many native vessels of life- boat and galley styles. The natives invited them to visit their villages ashore. He found the natives comely and friendly. They were under a pyramidal tribal structure, were polygamous, wore no clothes, painted their bodies, and wore jewelry: rings, bracelets, anklets, necklaces, some of which were made of gold. Furniture was often elaborately carved in the shape of animals with golden eyes and ears. They were all helpful, wondering at the Europeans. Inquiring as to the source of the gold, Columbus was told that it was produced on, and traded from, the island of Bohio. Markham thinks the natives may have been using the noun bohio, \\"home,\\" in their language, which he doubted the Spanish understood: On 5 November, the crews collected large amounts of spices that were very expensive in Europe. On the 6th, they were invited to a feast in a mountain village of 50 houses, 1000 population, who thought the Spanish were from heaven. The Spanish smoked tobacco for the first time. They repaid the kindness of the natives by beginning, on 12 November, to detain native visitors to the ship and kidnap natives on shore, planning to carry them back to Spain. Many would be sold into slavery there, against the express orders of the queen. The natives were so credulous that one father whose entire family had been kidnapped begged to be taken also so that he could share heaven. It was at this time that the reputation of childishness and simplicity became attached to the natives, whom the Spanish called Indios, \\"Indians.\\" He wrote to de Sant√°ngel: \\"they are so unsuspicious and so generous with what they possess, that no one who had not seen it would believe it.\\" On 21 November the fleet set course for Bohio. Natives aboard the Pinto told Columbus where it was. They must have known a great deal more not told to Columbus, as the master of the Pinto decided to go gold hunting on his own. After a confrontation with Columbus the Pinto weighed anchor and disappeared. On 23 November the Nina and Santa Maria reached Bohio. =Shipwreck= The details of the Santa Maria's end were given in Columbus' journal, and his son Ferdinand's Life of Columbus. The two often differ. Ferdinand had access to the original journal, while moderns can access only the summary of Las Casas. Only hypothetical reconstructions of the sequence of events are available. They depend on, or determine, (unknown which) the meaning of certain features and events in the now unknown original. The overall location is certain. Various investigators have examined it in person, drawing different conclusions, among them Samuel Eliot Morison. The archaeologists also have been at work. No evidence is for certain. Interpretations depend on a perceived preponderance of circumstantial evidence. The wreck did not occur on any planned return trip, as though the mere discovery of new lands was enough for the great explorer. On the contrary, Columbus was on a hunt for portable valuables, having already claimed the entire region as the property of Spain, even though it was inhabited by a populous trading and agricultural nation. That nation was told nothing of Columbus' intent. The main commodities that he was now seeking were gold, spices, and people, in that order. On 24 December (1492), not having slept for two days, Columbus decided at 11:00 p.m. to lie down to sleep. The night being calm, the steersman also decided to sleep, leaving only a cabin boy to steer the ship, a practice which the admiral had always strictly forbidden. With the boy at the helm, the currents carried the ship onto a sandbank. She struck \\"so gently that it could scarcely be felt.\\" The obstacle was not a shoal. but a bar protruding above the surface, a beach, and waves with audible surf. The ship was making way into the ever diminishing shallows and becoming embedded more and more deeply in the sandy bottom. The boy shouted. The admiral appeared, followed shortly by the captain. Under orders of the admiral to sink an anchor astern to impede the drift, the captain and seamen launched a boat. As the relationship between the admiral and the captain and crew was never very good (the admiral had commandeered the captain's ship), the admiral remained forever recriminatory about what happened next. Disregarding the admiral's orders, the boat rowed to the nearby Nina, the admiral says, to ask for rescue. Shortly they turned back accompanied by a boat from the Nina, the idea being, perhaps, that the two boats might tow the flagship back to deeper waters. The admiral claims that the renegade crew was denied permission to board. The Pinta was nowhere in sight. There is another interpretation. Asserting that the hasty abandonment of the vessel was less than credible, Arthur Davies hypothesizes that the captain perceived the ship as being beyond the help of small boats and an anchor, but might yet be hauled off by the Nina under sail in the prevailing offshore winds. He interprets Columbus' words and deeds as probable hypocrisy: \\"If anyone 'wrecked' the Santa Maria of set purpose, it was surely the admiral himself.\\" The admiral used this method, he suggests, of placing a colony on Hispaniola, which he knew that the rest of the company would not accept otherwise. His motive was the fact that the natives were obtaining gold in the highlands and were brokering it abroad. He needed gold and land to pay for the voyage. The ship ran aground off the present-day site of Cap-Ha√Øtien, Haiti. Realizing that the ship was beyond repair, Columbus ordered his men to strip the timbers from the ship. The timbers were later used to build a fort which Columbus called La Navidad (Christmas) because the wreck occurred on Christmas Day, north from the modern town of Limonade (see map, and the photograph). Santa Mar√≠a carried several anchors, possibly six.Before presumed discovery of Columbus‚Äô Santa Maria off Haiti, there was an anchor, Miami Herald, 25 May 2014 One of the anchors now rests in the Mus√©e du Panth√©on National Ha√Øtien (MUPANAH), in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. On 13 May 2014, underwater archaeological explorer Barry Clifford claimed that his team had found the wreck of Santa Mar√≠a. In the following October, UNESCO's expert team published their final report, concluding that the wreck could not be Columbus's vessel. Fastenings used in the hull and possible copper sheathing dated it to the 17th or 18th century. Ship's company Santa maria replica in arrecife lanzarote 2018.jpgSanta Maria in profile (2018 replica).

She spent the better part of her working career in Spain researching the records on Columbus and his times, only coming home for a few years to avoid the Spanish Civil War. Gould died of natural causes before she was able to publish a book, but her articles and notes survive. A book was assembled for her posthumously and published in 1984 by the Real Academia de la Historia in Madrid. It is entitled Nueva lista documentada de los tripulantes de Col√≥n en 1492 Building the list She began with the existing lists of three major contributors, whom she termed \\"Fern√°ndez Duro,\\" \\"Tenorio\\" and \\"Vignau.\\" In the comparative list they each received their own column headed by their own abbreviation: FD, T, and V respectively. The list is a column of names with the additional columns marking which author was \\"in\\" or \\"out\\" for that name. She explains that the only way she could make a comparative list was to arrange them in alphabetic order by first name, as the first names in the sources varied least of all. Each item in the list has a phrase distinguishing the person, almost always their position. She explains that the full entry is given in a later installment (which it is). She had her own column, headed G for \\"Gould.\\" There are actually four tables, one for 87 secure names, one for imaginary names, one for wrong names, and one for remaining names, considered uncertain from Gould's point of view. The G names were only in the secure category. Comparing and further investigating the three lists (her own being the fourth) and the documents on which they were based, she undertook to distinguish fact from fancy and to fill in sociological information by analysis. She called the 87 \\"the crew list\\" (los tripulantes de Col√≥n en 1492) without making the fine distinctions of the long tradition of maritime language. For example, if \\"tripulantes\\" were \\"de Col√≥n\\" then Col√≥n was not one of them. The final list aimed at everyone on board the three ships regardless of rank or position; thus, the three captains and the admiral were among them. There were no passengers, marines, expeditionaries, or settlers, as there were on the second voyage. The records from which the total list of persons that went on the first voyage of Columbus was derived are not sufficiently complete and accurate to provide unquestonable certainty. Due to the length of time, losses by neglect and catastrophe, as well as changes in the language, and copyist errors, have left a patchwork of often contradictory source material. Any list must represent the best solutions to the many problems but there are often many possibilities. Gould's list of 87 persons authorized to be on the three ships of the fleet, has become a standard by default, but she would have been the last person to claim any sort of permanence for it. She regarded the list as being \\"safe\\" (seguros), but asserted that in 50 years it would undoubtedly be quite different, \\"La lista que ahora ofrezco no puede ser completa, ni mucho menos. De aqu√≠ a cincuenta a√±os seguramente se sabr√° m√°s de Col√≥n y de sus asuntos. Lo que deseo es, que por muchas que sean las ampliaciones futuras, haya poco que borrar en lo que aqu√≠ se ofrece.\\" due, presumably, to the new discovery of old documents. After the end of the 50 years since her death, the list is still considered the best. The figure of 87 matches the figure of 90 overall given by Las Casas. The filial biography also gives 90. Gould reluctantly adopts the 90 instead of the 120 stated by Oviedo, reluctant because she thought 90 was \\"insufficient.\\" Still, 87 is not 90. Allowing for the possibility of missing records, she estimates the fleet to have included 87 through 134 persons, which invalidates some modern claims that the list has been \\"completely known\\" or has \\"long been known.\\" Alice never thought it was, and the 50 years of changes she anticipated never transpired, for whatever reasons. If it was not completely and accurately known then, it is not now. Gould estimates the complement for each ship as follows. The number of men left at Fort Christmas must be about equal to the complement of the Santa Maria. If more were left, the other two crews would be short necessary sailors, and if less, the other ships would have more than they planned for. As 39 men were left, Gould rounds off to about 40 men. The ones left would not necessarily have been crewmen of the Santa Maria. They were very likely volunteers, with the crew of the Santa Maria filling in for them. The Nina went on Columbus' attempt to explore the coast of Cuba on the second voyage. Columbus had each man of his fleet of three interviewed as to whether he thought Cuba was mainland Asia, and make an affidavit. The number of affidavits on the Nina were recorded. The company of 16 for the Nina must represent the number of men required to sail the ship. Gould therefore rounds off to 20, leaving 30 for the Pinta. The sources The gaps in the records are an accumulation of losses and errors over a period of some centuries. Ferdinand and Isabella left little to chance. They created an administration that exercised total control over the growth of the Spanish Empire. It kept detailed records. The first step was to appoint a royal officer, the Bishop of Badajoz, to manage the fleet of exploration. Isabella appointed her own chaplain (Juan Rodr√≠guez de Fonseca). He handled matters such as the payroll, pensions, supplies and outfitting, etc. By 1503, near the end of their joint reign ‚Äì Isabella was to die the next year, while Ferdinand lost the regency and the lordship of the Indies ‚Äì the royals created the Casa de Contrataci√≥n de las Indios in Seville, a royal agency to manage all New World exploration. Fonseca went on into the Casa, implementing their intention long after they were dead. It had sweeping powers to do everything required: hire and train cosmographers (a combination of map-maker and navigator), manufacture charts, procure ships, assign explorations, designate colonists, manage colonies from afar, impose taxes upon them, and so on. It kept records of every aspect. Kept secret in the organization was the map template for produced maps. Evidently the experiences of Juan de la Cosa caused them to change the open map policy. As the Empire continued to grow, in 1524 the monarch placed another level of management over the Casa: the Council of the Indies. It assumed most of the powers of the Casa. In addition it managed the new Spanish possessions in South and Central America as well as Mexico. The long-lived Fonseca went on into the Council, providing continuity. The Council also kept all the records of empire going back to the late 15th century, when it all began. They had been dispersed to different cities until in 1785 the General Archive of the Indies was created. The records were all to be moved to a new home in the building of the Casa Lonja de Mercadores in Seville, but a space problem soon became evident. it was decided to leave all records created in 1760 and after where they were; thus, a number of other important archives remain, one of which is the Archivo General de Simancas north of Madrid, the former royal archive. Gould spent the latter portion of her life working there, and died there in the entrance. The two archives have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The first author in Gould's history of the list is Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez de Navarrete (1765 ‚Äì 1844), a nobleman who had gone to sea as a midshipman at age 15 and, showing remarkable talent, had risen swiftly through the ranks of the officers. Invalided by poor health he became inactive but as a reward for his nobility, enthusiasm and interest, the monarch gave him a commission to research the archives for material relating to a maritime history of Spain. There he discovered the condensations of the logs for Columbus' first and third voyages. His researches were interrupted by Spain's war with Bonaparte, which it lost. Navarrete had rejoined, rose to command a frigate, fought in some major battles, and was solicited by Napoleon to become the minister of the navy of occupied Spain. Refusing, he retired to Andalusia to work on a constitution for the new Spain. When the conflict with Bonaparte was all over, and the revolutionary dictator was in exile, Navarrete was made director of the Real Academia de la Historia, from 1824 to his death in 1844, in which capacity he was an intensely prolific author, producing hundreds of works. His first task was the resumption of his history of the exploratory voyages of Spain, the first volume of the first edition coming out in 1825.Volume II also came out in 1825. One of its chapters contains a list of 40 men described as \\"Lista de las personas que Colon dej√≥ en la Isla Espa√±ola y hall√≥ muertas por los Indios cuando volvi√≥ a poblar;\\" that is, it is a list put forward as being the men who died at Fort Christmas. In 1884 another professional naval officer turned historian, Ces√°reo Fern√°ndez Duro, published a work, Colon y Pinzon, that presented list of 88 men who had gone with Columbus on the first voyage. =Gould's \\"Crew list\\" for the Santa Maria= The crew of Santa Mar√≠a is well-known,. The crew was not composed of criminals as is widely believed. Many were experienced seamen from the port of Palos in Andalusia and its surrounding countryside, as well as from the region of Galicia in northwest Spain. It is true, however, that the Spanish sovereigns offered an amnesty to convicts who signed up for the voyage; still, only four men took up the offer: one who had killed a man in a fight, and three friends of his who had then helped him escape from jail.Hale, Edward Everett. The Life of Christopher Columbus, Ch. IX. 1891. Replicas Little is definitively known about the actual dimensions of Santa Mar√≠a, since no explicit documentation has survived from that era. Since the 19th century, various notable replicas have been publicly commissioned or privately constructed. Of them Morison says: > So-called models, replicas or reproductions of Santa Maria and her consorts > are not models, replicas or reproductions, since no plans, drawings or > dimensions of them exist; they merely represent what some naval architect, > archaeologist, artist or ship modeler thinks these vessels ought to have > looked like. These opinions are not entirely uneducated. A number of shipwrecks of naos have been investigated, from which verisimilar general measurements could be made, and there are some statements from the literature from which dimensions can be deduced. Whether Morison, a former admiral in the United States Navy, is bringing realism to the topic, or is being perhaps slightly more skeptical than is warranted, is a matter of opinion. There is one sense in which none of the \\"replicas\\" replicate an ancient ship: the concessions to the conveniences of the modern world, especially on the ships meant actually to sail. These are well-hidden: it might be an engine, or modern rudder machinery in a closed compartment, or communications equipment. No modern sailors are expected to undergo the hardships of a 15th-century voyage. They have bunks where Columbus' sailors slept on the deck, and modern stoves instead of cooking fires on the deck. In case of emergencies, help is a radio call away. The Renaissance seamen risked life and limb, and some died on every voyage. They feared going to sea, and if they did go, feared to get out of sight of land. 1892 replica =Quadricentennial= Interest in reconstructing Santa Mar√≠a started in Spain at around 1890 for the 400th anniversary of Columbus's voyage. An 1892 reconstruction by the Spanish government depicted the ship as a nau. =West Edmonton Mall= 1986 replica A replica was built during Expo 86 and anchored in \\"Deep Sea Adventure Lake\\" at West Edmonton Mall. Built at False Creek in Vancouver, British Columbia, the ship was hand-carved and hand- painted, and then transported by flatbed trucks across the Rocky Mountains to Edmonton, Alberta. =Quincentennial= 1991 replica, the Santa Maria Ship and Museum A replica, depicted as a Carrack, was commissioned by the city of Columbus, Ohio as a museum ship, the Santa Maria Ship and Museum. It was built by the Scarano Brothers Boat Building Company in Albany, New York, who later cut the ship in half and transported it by truck to the Scioto River. The replica cost about 1.2 million dollars. The ship was constructed out of white cedar as opposed to an oak wood used on the original to give the ship a long life in the Scioto River and to reduce cost. The main mast was carved out of a single douglas fir tree and was equipped with a top sail (since removed). The ship was built using power tools, with a hull length of , keel length , beam , depth and load . The foremast is high, the mainmast is and mizzen mast is . The replica was declared by Jose Maria Martinez-Hidalgo, a Spanish marine historian, to be the most authentic replica of the Santa Mar√≠a in the world during the ship's coronation on 12 October 1991. Dana Rinehart, the 50th mayor of Columbus, christened the ship as part of the 500th anniversary of its voyage. The ship was removed from its moorings in 2014, cut into 10 pieces, and stored in a lot south of the city, pending funding to do repairs and restorations. As of early 2016, the plans for restoration have stalled. Its parts can be seen via satellite view on Google Maps . =Madeira= A functional replica was built on the island of Madeira, between July 1997 and July 1998, in the fishing village of C√¢mara de Lobos. The ship is long and wide. In 1998 Santa Mar√≠a represented the Madeira Wine Expo 98 in Lisbon, where she was visited by over 97,000 people in 25 days. Since then thousands more have sailed and continue to sail aboard that Santa Mar√≠a replica which is located in Funchal.

As was tradition for Spanish ships of the day, she bore a female saint's name, Santa Clara. However, she was commonly referred to by her nickname, La Ni√±a, which was probably a pun on the name of her owner, Juan Ni√±o of Moguer. She was a standard caravel-type vessel. The other ships of the Columbus expedition were the caravel-type and the carrack-type . Ni√±a was by far Columbus's favorite. She was originally lateen sail rigged caravela latina, but she was re-rigged as caravela redonda at Las Palmas, in the Canary Islands, with square sails for better ocean performance. There is no authentic documentation on the specifics of Ni√±as design, although Michele de Cuneo, who accompanied Columbus on his second voyage, mentioned that Ni√±a was \\"about 60 toneladas\\" (60 tons), which may indicate a medium-sized caravel of around in length on deck. Often said to have had three masts, there is some evidence she may have had four masts. Ni√±a, like Pinta and Santa Mar√≠a, was a smaller trade ship built to sail the Mediterranean sea, not the open ocean. It was greatly surpassed in size by ships like of the Hanseatic League, built in 1462, in length, and the English carrack , built during the period 1420‚Äì1439, weighing between 1,400 and 2,750 tons, and long, in both weight and length. History On Columbus's first expedition, Ni√±a carried 26 men, captained by Vicente Y√°√±ez Pinz√≥n. They left Palos de la Frontera on 3 August 1492, stopping at the Canary Islands on 12 August 1492, and continued westward. Landfall was made in the Bahamas at dawn on 12 October 1492. On 14 February 1493, in the east of the Azores, a storm threatened to capsize Ni√±a, and at Columbus's instigation, he and the crew took a series of vows to perform certain acts including religious pilgrimages upon their return to Spain.Christopher Columbus and Bartolom√© de las Casas, Samuel Kettell (translator), Personal narrative of the first voyage of Columbus to America: From a manuscript recently discovered in Spain, T. B. Wait and Son, 1827. p. 216. Online at Google Books. A version in modern Spanish‚ÄîText for 11-16 February ‚Äîcan be accessed online at artehistoria.jcyl.es. Ni√±a reached Lisbon, Portugal, on 4 March 1493, and arrived in Palos de la Frontera on 15 March 1493. On the first voyage to America, the crew of Ni√±a slept on the deck but adopted the use of hammocks after seeing Native Americans utilizing them. In September 1493, Ni√±a joined a grand fleet of 17 ships for the second voyage to Hispaniola, becoming the flagship for an exploration of Cuba. She was the only ship to survive the 1495 hurricane, returning quickly to Spain in 1496. Ni√±a was then chartered for an unauthorized voyage to Rome. She was captured by a pirate corsair when leaving the port of Cagliari and brought to Cape Pula, Sardinia. The Captain, Alonso Medel, escaped with a few men. He stole a boat, rowed back to Ni√±a, and made sail, returning to C√°diz. In 1498, she returned to Hispaniola as advance guard of Columbus's Third Voyage. She was lying in wait at Santo Domingo in 1500. In 1501, she made a trading voyage to the Pearl Coast on the island of Cubagua, Venezuela, and no further log of her is found in historic archives. Ni√±a logged at least under Columbus' command. Replicas Columbian Exposition The replica of the Columbus Foundation A replica of Ni√±a was built by the Spanish government for the Columbian Naval Review of 1893. Along with replicas of Santa Mar√≠a and Pinta she participated in the review. A replica of Ni√±a (based upon theory; there are no known contemporary likenesses of any of the three ships) now sails around the world. The 4-masted replica Ni√±a was built 1988-1991 by engineer and naval researcher John Patrick Sarsfield, British naval historian Jonathan Morton Nance, and a group of master shipbuilders in Bahia, Brazil who were still using design and construction techniques dating back to the 15th century. They built it from heavy, teredo-resistant Brazilian hardwoods using only adzes, axes, hand saws, and chisels. The sails were designed by Nance using square main sails and two aft lateen sails as were used by ships of this size at the end of the 15th century. The crew of Ni√±a say that it can make about , which is quicker than older designs of the era. The replica weighs 75 tons. In 1991, the replica sailed to Costa Rica to take part in the filming of 1492: Conquest of Paradise, and Ni√±a has visited hundreds of North America ports to give the public a chance to see and tour the ship. The vessel continues to visit ports across the Eastern to mid-United States along with its sister replica ship, Pinta. The replicas of Ni√±a and Pinta were built in Valen√ßa, Brazil using the same methods as the 15th century Portuguese. Other replicas are located in Andalusia, Spain (at El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a and at the Wharf of the Caravels in Palos de la Frontera). A replica had been harbored in Corpus Christi, Texas in the United States, but it sank on April 23, 2019‚Äîfrom Hurricane Harvey. The historic San Francisco restaurant Bernstein's Fish Grotto was designed to look like Ni√±a.

The New World was first sighted by Rodrigo de Triana aboard La Pinta on 12 October 1492. The owner of La Pinta was Crist√≥bal Quintero. The Quintero brothers were ship owners from Palos. The owner of the ship allowed Mart√≠n Alonso Pinz√≥n to take over the ship so he could keep an eye on the ship. La Pinta was a caravel-type vessel. By tradition Spanish ships were named after saints and usually given nicknames. Thus, La Pinta, like La Ni√±a, was not the ship's actual name; La Ni√±a's actual name was the Santa Clara. The Santa Mar√≠a's original nickname was La Gallega. The actual original name of La Pinta is unknown. The origin of the ship is disputed but is believed to have been built in Spain in the year 1441. She was later rebuilt for use by Christopher Columbus. Detail La Pinta was square rigged and smaller than . The ship displaced approximately 60 tons with an estimated deck length of and a width of .http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/christopher- columbus-ships.htm The crew size was 26 men under Captain Mart√≠n Alonso Pinz√≥n. The other ships of the Columbus expedition were La Ni√±a (real name Santa Clara) and Santa Mar√≠a. There are no known contemporary likenesses of Columbus's ships. Santa Mar√≠a (also known as the Gallega) was the largest, of a type known as a carrack (carraca in Spanish), or by the Portuguese term nau. La Ni√±a and La Pinta were smaller. They were called caravels, a name then given to the smallest three-masted vessels. Columbus once used her for a vessel of forty tons, but she generally applied in Portuguese or Spanish use to a vessel ranging one hundred and twenty to one hundred and forty Spanish \\"toneles\\". This word represents a capacity about one-tenth larger than that expressed by the modern English \\"ton\\". La Ni√±a and La Pinta replicas at the 1893 Columbian Exposition La Ni√±a, La Pinta, and Santa Mar√≠a were not the largest ships in Europe at the time. They were Columbus' ships at the time. They were small trade ships surpassed in size by ships like , built in Scotland in 1511 with a length of , and a crew of 300 sailors, 120 gunners, and up to 1,000 soldiers. of the Hanseatic League was built in 1462 and was long. Another large ship, the English carrack , was built during the period 1420‚Äì1439, was long, and weighed between 1,400 tons and 2,750 tons. Ships built in Europe in the fifteenth century were designed to sail the Mediterranean sea and the Atlantic Ocean coastlines. Columbus' smaller-sized ships were considered riskier on the open ocean than larger ships. This made it difficult to recruit crew members, and a small number were jailed prisoners given a light sentence if they would sail with Columbus. Most of the commerce of the time was the coastal commerce of the Mediterranean, so it was better if ships did not draw much water. As it sailed, the fleet of Columbus consisted of Gallega (the Galician), which he changed to Santa Mar√≠a, and of La Pinta and La Ni√±a. Of these the first two were of a tonnage that should be rated as about one hundred and thirty tons. La Ni√±a was much smaller, not more than fifty tons. One writer says that they were all without full decks, that is, that such decks as they had did not extend from stem to stern. Other authorities, however, speak as if La Ni√±a only was an open vessel, and the two larger were decked. Columbus himself took command of Santa Mar√≠a, Martin Alonso Pinzon of La Pinta, and his brothers, Francis Martin and Vicente Yanez, of La Ni√±a. The whole company in all three ships likely numbered 90 men (Santa Maria ‚Äî 40, La Nina ‚Äî 24, La Pinta ‚Äî 26) although some historians cite 120 men.

In 1923, he was hired as Master of Form at the Bauhaus theatre workshop, after working at the workshop of sculpture. His most famous work is Triadisches Ballett (Triadic Ballet), which saw costumed actors transformed into geometrical representations of the human body in what he described as a \\"party of form and colour\\".  Biography  = Childhood and apprenticeships = Born in September 1888 in Swabia, Germany, Oskar Schlemmer was the youngest of six children. His parents, Carl Leonhard Schlemmer and Mina Neuhaus, both died around 1900 and the young Oskar lived with his sister and learned at an early age to provide for himself. By 1903 he was completely independent and supporting himself as an apprentice in an inlay workshop, moving on to another apprenticeship in marquetry from 1905 to 1909. Oskar Schlemmer studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Applied Arts) in Stuttgart and won a scholarship to attend the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste (Stuttgart Academy of Fine Art), where he studied under the tutelage of landscape painters Christian Landenberger and Friedrich von Keller starting in 1906. In 1910 Schlemmer moved to Berlin where he painted some of his first important works before returning to Stuttgart in 1912 as the master pupil of abstract artist Adolf H√∂lzel, abandoning impressionism and moving toward cubism in his work. In 1914 Schlemmer was enlisted to fight on the Western Front in World War I until he was wounded and moved to a position with the military cartography unit in Colmar, where he resided until returning to work under H√∂lzel in 1918. = The Bauhaus years = Schlemmer's nickel-cast \\"Tut Schlemmer\\" (1919), Museum f√ºr Angewandte Kunst K√∂ln, Germany.

In 1919 Schlemmer turned to sculpture and had an exhibition of his work at the gallery Der Sturm in Berlin. At the same time he helped to update the curriculum at the Stuttgart Academy of Fine Art with the appointment of new faculty and exhibitions of modern art. Among those involved were Paul Klee and Willi Baumeister. After his marriage to Helena Tutein in 1920, Schlemmer was invited to Weimar by Walter Gropius to run the mural-painting and sculpture departments at the Bauhaus School before taking over the stagecraft workshop from Lothar Schreyer in 1923.Bauhaus100. Workshops. Stagecraft. Retrieved 6 December 2018 His complex ideas were influential, making him one of the most important teachers working at the school at that time. However, due to the heightened political atmosphere in Germany at the end of the 1920s, and in particular with the appointment of the radical communist architect Hannes Meyer as Gropius's successor, in 1929 Schlemmer resigned his position and moved to take up a job at the Art Academy in Breslau. Schlemmer became known internationally with the premi√®re of his 'Triadisches Ballett' in Stuttgart in 1922. His work for the Bauhaus and his preoccupation with the theatre are an important factor in his work, which deals mainly with the problematic of the figure in space. People, typically stylised faceless female figures, continued to be the predominant subject in his painting. While at Bauhaus, he developed the multidisciplinary course \\"Der Mensch (The human being).\\" In the human form he saw a measure that could provide a foothold in the disunity of his time. After using Cubism as a springboard for his structural studies, Schlemmer's work became intrigued with the possibilities of figures and their relationship to the space around them, for example 'Egocentric Space Lines' (1924). Schlemmer's characteristic forms can be seen in his sculptures as well as his paintings. Yet he also turned his attention to stage design, first getting involved with this in 1929, executing settings for the opera 'Nightingale' and the ballet 'Renard' by Igor Stravinsky. = Life and death under the Third Reich = From 1928 to 1930, Schlemmer worked on nine murals for a room in the Folkwang Museum in Essen. After leaving the Bauhaus in 1929, Schlemmer took a post at the Akademie in Breslau, where he painted his most celebrated work, the 'Bauhaustreppe', ('Bauhaus Stairway') (1932; Museum of Modern Art, New York). He was obliged to leave the Breslau Academy when it was closed down in the wake of the financial crisis following the Wall Street Crash, and took up a professorship at Berlin's Vereinigte Staatsschulen f√ºr freie und angewandete Kunst (United State School for Fine and Applied Art) in 1932, which he held until 1933 when he was forced to resign due to pressure from the Nazis. The Schlemmers then moved to Eichberg near the Swiss border, and then to Sehringen before his pictures were displayed at the Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich in 1937. The last ten years of his life were spent in a state of 'inner emigration'. Max Bill, in his obituary of Schlemmer, wrote that it was 'as if a curtain of silence' had descended over him during this time. During World War II, Schlemmer worked at the Institut f√ºr Malstoffe in Wuppertal, along with Willi Baumeister and Georg Muche, run by the philanthropist Kurt Herbert. The factory offered Schlemmer the opportunity to paint without the fear of persecution. His series of eighteen small, mystical paintings entitled \\"Fensterbilder\\" (\\"Window Pictures,\\" 1942) were painted while looking out the window of his house and observing neighbors engaged in their domestic tasks. These were Schlemmer's final works before his death in the hospital at Baden- Baden in 1943.  Legacy  Schlemmer's ideas on art were complex and challenging even for the progressive Bauhaus movement. His work, nevertheless, was widely exhibited in both Germany and outside the country. His work was a rejection of pure abstraction, instead retaining a sense of the human, though not in the emotional sense but in view of the physical structure of the human. He represented bodies as architectural forms, reducing the figure to a rhythmic play between convex, concave and flat surfaces. And not just of its form, he was fascinated by every movement the body could make; trying to capture it in his work. As well as leaving a large body of work behind, Schlemmer art theories have also been published. A comprehensive book of his letters and diary entries from 1910 to 1943 is also available. Along with Schlemmer's diary, his private letters to Otto Meyer and Willi Baumeister have given valuable insight on what happened at the Bauhaus; especially his writings of how the staff and students responded to the many changes and developments at the school. Schlemmer's first retrospective in the United States was mounted by the Baltimore Museum of Art in 1986. On 4 September 2018, to commemorate what would have been his 130th birthday, Google released a Google Doodle celebrating him. = Controversy = Bauhaustreppe (Bauhaus Stairway), 1932, Museum of Modern Art, New York In 2000, the artist's daughter Ute Jaina Schlemmer, who asserted that she owns the painting Bauhaus Stairway (Bauhaustreppe) or is owed money for it, obtained a court order to hold it for further investigation while it was on temporary loan from the Museum of Modern Art in New York to the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin. Before the injunction was served on the Neue Nationalgalerie, Bauhaus Stairway had already been packed and shipped to New York.  Art market  In 1998, Schlemmer's Idealistic Encounter (1928) was sold for $1.487 million at Sotheby's in New York.

Biography Louis Charles was born at the Palais-Royal in Paris. He was the third and youngest son of Philippe d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Chartres, later Duke of Orl√©ans as Philippe √âgalit√©, and of his wife, Louise Marie Ad√©la√Øde de Bourbon. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a prince du sang. His mother was the greatest heiress of the age as the only surviving child of the vastly wealthy duc de Penthi√®vre. She was also the sister in law of the famous princesse de Lamballe. In 1781 the Countess of Genlis was appointed to be the governess to Louis-Charles and to his two older brothers Louis-Philippe and Antoine.Memoirs of the Madame de Genlis (New York: Wilder and Campbell, 1825), II, 88. Two years later the abb√© Mariottini, nephew of the apostolic nuncio to France was made his tutor, but he resigned in 1786 after a conflict with Madame de Genlis. Louis Charles was then tutored by the first chamberlain Barrois, before being assigned to the under-governor Lebrun in 1789. In April 1793 Louis Charles was arrested with his father and imprisoned at Fort-Saint- Jean in Marseille. During his imprisonment he contracted tuberculosis, a condition which eventually caused his death. His father was executed in November 1793 but Louis Charles remained imprisoned until August 1796 when the Directory decided to exile him and his brother Antoine to Philadelphia. The French charg√© d'affaires in Philadelphia settled upon Louis-Charles an annual pension of 15,000 francs. In February 1797 Louis Charles and Antoine were joined in Philadelphia by their older brother Louis Philippe. Together they travelled to New York City and Boston, and as far north as Maine and as far south as Nashville. In September 1797 Louis Charles and his brothers learnt that their mother had gone into exile in Spain, and so they decided to return to Europe. They went to New Orleans, planning to sail to Cuba and from there to Spain. The ship they took from New Orleans, however, was captured by a British warship in the Gulf of Mexico. The British seized the three brothers, but took them to Havana anyway. Unable to find passage to Europe, the three brothers spent a year in Cuba, until they were unexpectedly expelled by the Spanish authorities. They sailed via the Bahamas to Nova Scotia. Eventually, the brothers sailed back to New York, and in January 1800, they arrived in England, where they settled at Twickenham outside London. In September 1804 Louis Charles entered the Royal Navy, but his health did not allow him to continue a military career. In October he and his brothers went on a brief expedition to the French coast. They were fired upon by the French batteries at Boulogne but escaped without harm.The Times (October 3, 1804): 2. In 1808, in an attempt to improve Louis Charles' health, his older brother Louis Philippe accompanied him on a voyage to Gibraltar, Sicily and Malta. The brothers were received at Casa Miari, a palace in the Maltese capital city Valletta. Louis Charles, however, continued to deteriorate; he died of tuberculosis a fortnight after his arrival on the island. His funeral took place on 3 June. Ten years later his body was buried on 10 April 1818 in St. John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta. James Pradier designed and sculpted his tomb, a replica of which is at Dreux. Louis Charles' portrait was painted posthumously in 1818 by Albert Gregorius (now in the Palais Royal) and by Charles-Francois Phelippes (now in the Palais-Royal). Another portrait was painted in 1835 by Am√©d√©e Faur√© (now at the Ch√¢teau d'Eu).

As one of the casemate- style turretless Jagdpanzer (tank destroyer, literally \\"hunting tank\\") designs, it was developed against the wishes of Heinz Guderian, the inspector general of the Panzertruppen, as a replacement for the Sturmgesch√ºtz III (StuG III). Guderian objected against the needless, in his eyes, diversion of resources from Panzer IV tank production, as the Sturmgesch√ºtz III was still more than adequate for its role. Officially, only the L/48-armed vehicle was named Jagdpanzer IV. The L/70-armed vehicle was named Panzer IV/70. In this article, both versions are referred to in general as Jagdpanzer IV, except in the variants and surviving vehicles section. Development With experience gained during the initial phases of the Battle of Stalingrad, in September 1942 the Wehrmacht's arms bureau, the Waffenamt, called for a new standard for heavy assault guns: 100 mm of armor to the front, 40‚Äì50 mm on the sides, wider tracks, ground clearance of 50 cm, top speed of 26 km/h and the lowest possible firing positions. The new Panzerj√§ger (\\"tank hunter\\") design would be armed with the same 7.5 cm gun as fitted to the Panther: the Pak 42 L/70. Initially a new chassis was planned, but that of the Panzer IV had to be used. Previous efforts to mount bigger guns on smaller chassis resulted in the Marder series as well as StuG IIIs. The Marder series were tall and had open crew compartments. The new design had a low silhouette and completely enclosed, casemate-style fighting compartment. The Jagdpanzer IV used a modified Panzer IV Ausf. H chassis, but the almost-vertical front hull plate was replaced by sloped armor plates. Internally, the layout was changed to accommodate the new superstructure, moving the fuel tanks and ammunition racks. Since the Jagdpanzer lacked a turret, the auxiliary engine which powered the Panzer IV's turret traverse mechanism could be eliminated. The new superstructure had 80 mm thick sloped armour, giving much greater protection than vertical armour of 100 mm. To make the manufacturing process as simple as possible, the superstructure was made from large, interlocking plates that were welded together. Armament consisted of a 7.5 cm main gun, originally intended to be the Pak 42 L/70. Due to shortages, older guns were initially used, the 7.5 cm Pak 39 L/43 for pre-production, and the 7.5 cm Pak 39 L/48 for the initial production variant. These were shorter and less powerful than the Pak 42, and also carried a muzzle brake. Installing the much heavier Pak 42 meant that the Jagdpanzer IV was nose heavy, especially with the heavy frontal armour. This made them less mobile and more difficult to operate in rough terrain, leading their crews to nickname them Guderian-Ente (\\"Guderian's duck\\"). To prevent the rubber rims of the roadwheels being dislocated by the weight of the vehicle, some later versions had steel roadwheels installed on the front. The final prototype of the Jagdpanzer IV was presented in December 1943 and production started in January 1944, with the Pak 39 L/48 armed variant staying in production until November. Production of the Pak 42 L/70 armed variants started in August and continued until March/April 1945. On 19‚Äì22 August 1943, after the Battle of Kursk, Hitler received reports that StuG IIIs performed better than the Panzer IV within the constraints of how they were deployed. It was thus intended to stop production of the Panzer IV itself at the end of 1944 to concentrate solely on production of the Jagdpanzer IV, but the Panzer IV continued to be produced until the end of the conflict along with Jagdpanzer IV. VoMAG in Plauen switched completely from Panzer IV production to Jagdpanzer IV in Spring 1944, Krupp-Grusonwerk in Magdeburg switched to StuG IV in early 1944, and only the Nibelungenwerk in St. Valentin continued with Panzer IV production.

The \\"Lang\\" (German for \\"long\\") in its name was added to distinguish it from its predecessor with a shorter L/48 7.5cm gun. *Panzer IV/70 (A) (Sd.Kfz.162/1) :the other Pak 42 L/70 armed Jagdpanzer IV. In order to send Pak 42 L/70 armed vehicles to the front as soon as possible, in July 1944 Hitler ordered an interim solution to speed up Nibelungenwerke's transition from Panzer IV production to Panzer IV/70 production. \\"A\\" stands for Alkett, a manufacturer of the StuG III, that was ordered to redesign the Jagdpanzer IV superstructure to be mounted onto a standard Panzer IV chassis. The Vomag design used a modified chassis permitting a very low silhouette. Mounting the superstructure onto the original Panzer IV chassis required additional vertical steel plates mounted onto the chassis to counter height differences. The resulting vehicle was about 40 cm taller and lacked the sharp edged nose of the Vomag variant. Only 278 were built by Nibelungenwerke from August 1944 to March 1945. Minor modifications and improvements were made throughout the production runs of all variants, as well as several field improvements, the most common being the addition of armour sideskirts. Originally the Jagdpanzer IV's gun had a muzzle brake installed, but because the gun was so close to the ground, each time it was fired, huge dust clouds would betray the vehicle's position, leading many crews to remove the muzzle brake in the field. Later variants dispensed with the muzzle brake. Early vehicles had zimmerit applied to the hull to protect against magnetic mines, but this was discontinued after about September 1944. Later vehicles had three return rollers rather than the original four, and adopted the twin vertical exhausts typical of the late Panzer IV series. Combat history Jagdpanzer IV with infantry support, Hungary, 1944 The Jagdpanzer IV served in the anti- tank sections of Panzer and SS Panzer divisions. The vehicle fought against Western Allied forces in Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge, and Soviet tanks and troops on the Eastern Front. It was very successful as a tank destroyer due to its low profile, accurate gun and good armour protection, but performed poorly when used out of role as a substitute for tanks or assault guns to support infantry. This was increasingly necessary in the later stages of the war from late 1944 to 1945, because there was often nothing else available to the badly depleted German armoured units. Romania received several Jagdpanzer IV/70 from the Red Army after the war ended. They were officially known as TAs T4 in their army's inventory and were used until 1950 when they were phased out. German armour in Romanian service, including the Jagdpanzer IV, was replaced entirely with Soviet vehicles in 1954. Bulgaria also received Jagdpanzer IVs from both Germany and the Soviet Union (most coming from the latter post-WWII), and they saw limited service in the postwar Bulgarian military before being stripped of all engine components, dug in and turned into fixed gun emplacements on its border with neighbouring Turkey, as part of the Krali Marko Line (now fallen into disrepair). Most of these ex- German vehicles have being dug up recently, with some scrapped while others await restoration locally or abroad. Jagdpanzer IV aces include SS- Oberscharf√ºhrer (2nd Lieutenant) Rudolf Roy from the 12th SS Panzerj√§ger Battalion of 12th SS Panzer Division. He was killed by an American sniper while looking out of the hatch of his Jagdpanzer IV on December 17 in 1944 during the Ardennes Offensive in Belgium, the last major German offensive on the Western Front. After the war, West Germany continued the Jagdpanzer concept with the Kanonenjagdpanzer, but few other fixed-casemate self- propelled guns were built in the postwar era. An innovative exception was the Swedish Stridsvagn 103, more widely known as the \\"S-Tank\\". Along with Panzer IVs and Sturmgesch√ºtz IIIs, Syria acquired in the 1950s six Jagdpanzer IV L/48s.Naud, Phillipe (2011), \\"Les Blindes de Damas 1948-1967\\", in Steel Masters n¬∫105, May‚ÄìJune, 2011 These were used in the conflicts with Israel up until 1967 when most were either destroyed, abandoned on the Golan Heights overlooking Israel, or scrapped.

This theorem assumes that the contour \\\\partial K is simple, that is, without self- intersections. Rouch√©'s theorem is an easy consequence of a stronger symmetric Rouch√©'s theorem described below.  Usage  The theorem is usually used to simplify the problem of locating zeros, as follows. Given an analytic function, we write it as the sum of two parts, one of which is simpler and grows faster than (thus dominates) the other part. We can then locate the zeros by looking at only the dominating part. For example, the polynomial z^5 + 3z^3 + 7 has exactly 5 zeros in the disk z < 2 since 3z^3 + 7 \\\\le 31 < 32 = z^5 for every z = 2, and z^5, the dominating part, has five zeros in the disk.  Geometric explanation  Since the distance between the curves is small, h(z) does exactly one turn around just as f(z) does. It is possible to provide an informal explanation of Rouch√©'s theorem. Let C be a closed, simple curve (i.e., not self-intersecting). Let h(z) = f(z) + g(z). If f and g are both holomorphic on the interior of C, then h must also be holomorphic on the interior of C. Then, with the conditions imposed above, the Rouche's theorem in its original (and not symmetric) form says that : If f(z) > h(z) ‚àí f(z), for every z in C, then f and h have the same number of zeros in the interior of C. Notice that the condition f(z) > h(z) ‚àí f(z) means that for any z, the distance from f(z) to the origin is larger than the length of h(z) ‚àí f(z), which in the following picture means that for each point on the blue curve, the segment joining it to the origin is larger than the green segment associated with it. Informally we can say that the blue curve f(z) is always closer to the red curve h(z) than it is to the origin. The previous paragraph shows that h(z) must wind around the origin exactly as many times as f(z). The index of both curves around zero is therefore the same, so by the argument principle, f(z) and h(z) must have the same number of zeros inside C. One popular, informal way to summarize this argument is as follows: If a person were to walk a dog on a leash around and around a tree, such that the distance between the person and the tree is always greater than the length of the leash, then the person and the dog go around the tree the same number of times.  Applications  Consider the polynomial z^2 + 2az + b^2 (where a > b > 0). By the quadratic formula it has two zeros at -a \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}. Rouch√©'s theorem can be used to obtain more precise positions of them. Since :z^2 + b^2 \\\\le 2b^2 < 2az for every z = b, Rouch√©'s theorem says that the polynomial has exactly one zero inside the disk z < b. Since -a - \\\\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} is clearly outside the disk, we conclude that the zero is -a + \\\\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}. This sort of argument can be useful in locating residues when one applies Cauchy's residue theorem. Rouch√©'s theorem can also be used to give a short proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. Let :p(z) = a_0 + a_1z + a_2 z^2 + \\\\cdots + a_n z^n, \\\\quad a_n e 0 and choose R>0 so large that: :a_0 + a_1z + \\\\cdots + a_{n-1} z^{n-1} \\\\le \\\\sum_{j=0}^{n - 1} a_j R^j < a_n R^n = a_n z^n \\\\text{ for } z = R. Since a_n z^n has n zeros inside the disk z < R (because R>0), it follows from Rouch√©'s theorem that p also has the same number of zeros inside the disk. One advantage of this proof over the others is that it shows not only that a polynomial must have a zero but the number of its zeros is equal to its degree (counting, as usual, multiplicity). Another use of Rouch√©'s theorem is to prove the open mapping theorem for analytic functions. We refer to the article for the proof.  Symmetric version  A stronger version of Rouch√©'s theorem was already known to Theodor Estermann by 1962. It states: let K\\\\subset G be a bounded region with continuous boundary \\\\partial K. Two holomorphic functions f,\\\\,g\\\\in\\\\mathcal H(G) have the same number of roots (counting multiplicity) in K, if the strict inequality :f(z)-g(z)<f(z)+g(z) \\\\qquad \\\\left(z\\\\in \\\\partial K\\\\right) holds on the boundary \\\\partial K. The original version of Rouch√©'s theorem then follows from this symmetric version applied to the functions f+g,f together with the observation that f(z)+g(z) eq 0 when z is on \\\\partial K. The statement can be understood intuitively as follows. By considering -g in place of g, the condition can be rewritten as f(z) + g(z)<f(z)+g(z) for z\\\\in \\\\partial K. Since f(z) + g(z) \\\\leq f(z)+g(z) always holds by the triangle inequality, this is equivalent to saying that f(z) + g(z) eq f(z)+g(z) on \\\\partial K, which is implied by the condition \\\\arg{f(z)} eq \\\\arg{g(z)}. Intuitively, if the values of f and g never point in the same direction as z circles along \\\\partial K, then f(z) and g(z) must wind around the origin the same number of times.  Proof of the symmetric form of Rouch√©'s theorem  Let C\\\\colon[0,1]\\\\to\\\\mathbb C be a simple closed curve whose image is the boundary \\\\partial K. The hypothesis implies that f has no roots on \\\\partial K, hence by the argument principle, the number Nf(K) of zeros of f in K is :\\\\frac1{2\\\\pi i}\\\\oint_C\\\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\\\\,dz=\\\\frac1{2\\\\pi i}\\\\oint_{f\\\\circ C} \\\\frac{dz}z =\\\\mathrm{Ind}_{f\\\\circ C}(0), i.e., the winding number of the closed curve f\\\\circ C around the origin; similarly for g. The hypothesis ensures that g(z) is not a negative real multiple of f(z) for any z = C(x), thus 0 does not lie on the line segment joining f(C(x)) to g(C(x)), and :H_t(x)=(1-t)f(C(x))+tg(C(x)) is a homotopy between the curves f\\\\circ C and g\\\\circ C avoiding the origin. The winding number is homotopy-invariant: the function :I(t)=\\\\mathrm{Ind}_{H_t}(0)=\\\\frac1{2\\\\pi i}\\\\oint_{H_t}\\\\frac{dz}z is continuous and integer-valued, hence constant. This shows :N_f(K)=\\\\mathrm{Ind}_{f\\\\circ C}(0)=\\\\mathrm{Ind}_{g\\\\circ C}(0)=N_g(K).

The sect owed its name (oi peri Akakion, those of Acacius) and political importance to Acacius, Bishop of Caesarea, whose theory of adherence to scriptural phraseology it adopted and endeavoured to summarize in its various catch words: homoios, homoios kata panta, k.t.l. Background In order to understand the theological significance of Acacianism as a critical episode in both the logical and historical progress of Arianism, it is needful to recall that the definition of the Homoousion, promulgated at the First Council of Nicaea in 325, rather than putting an end to further discussion, became the occasion for keener debate and for still more confusion of statement in the formulation of theories on the relationship of the Son of God to His Father. Events had already begun to ripen towards a fresh crisis shortly after the advent of Emperor Constantius II to sole power, on the death of his brother Constans in the year 350. The new augustus was a man with a turn for theological debate (Ammianus, XXI, xvi) that soon made him a strong promoter of the Eusebian faction. Roughly speaking, there were at this period only three parties in the Church: the Nicene party, who sympathized for the most part with Athanasius and his supporters; the Eusebian or Court party and their Semi-Arian followers; and, last of all, the Anomoean party which owed its origin to Aetius. In the summer of 357, Ursacius of Singidunum and Valens of Mursa, the advocates of this latter group of dissidents in the West, through the influence which they were enabled to bring to bear upon the Emperor by means of his second wife, Aurelia Eusebia (Panegyr. Jul. Orat., iii; Ammianus, XXI, vi, 4), succeeded in bringing about a conference of bishops at Sirmium. Sirmian Manifesto In the Latin creed put forth at this meeting there was inserted a statement of views drawn up by Potamius of Lisbon and Hosius of Cordoba, which, under the name of the Sirmian Manifesto, as it afterwards came to be known, threw the Church into disorder. In this statement the assembled prelates, while declaring their confession in \\"One God, the Father Almighty, and in His only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, generated from Him before the ages,\\" recommended the disuse of the terms ousia (essence, or substance), homoousion (identical in essence, or substance), and homoiousion (similar in essence, or substance), \\"by which the minds of many are perturbed\\"; and they held that there \\"ought to be no mention of any of them at all, nor any exposition of them in the Church, and for this reason and for this consideration that there is nothing written about them in divine Scripture and that they are above men's knowledge and above men's understanding\\" (Athan., De Syn., xxviii; Soz., ii, xxx; Hil., De Syn., xi). In spite of the scriptural disclaimer against the employment of inscrutable terms, nearly all parties perceived that the Manifesto was a subtly Anomoean document. The situation was assuredly rich in possibilities. Men began to group themselves along new lines. In the East, the Anomoeans turned almost as a matter of course to Acacius of Caesarea, whose influence was growing stronger at court and who was felt to be a shrewd temporizer. In the West, bishops like Ursacius of Singidunum and Valens of Mursa began to carry on a like policy; and everywhere it was felt that the time called once more for concerted action on the part of the Church. This was precisely what the party in favour with the Emperor Constantius II were eager to bring about; but not in the way in which the Nicaeans and Moderates expected. A single council might not be easily controlled; but two separate synods, one sitting in the East and the other in the West, could be kept better in hand. After a number of preliminary conferences accompanying an inevitable campaign of pamphleteering in which Hilary of Poitiers took part, the bishops of the Western portion of the Empire met at Ariminum towards the end of May, and those of the East at Seleucia Isauria in the month of September, 359. The theological complexion of both Synods was identical, at least in this, that the party of compromise, represented at Seleucia by Acacius and at Ariminum by Ursacius and Valens, was politically, though not numerically, in the ascendant and could exercise a subtle influence which depended almost as much on the argumentative ability of their leaders as on their curial prestige. In both councils, as the result of dishonest intrigue and an unscrupulous use of intimidation, the Homoian formula associated with the name of Acacius ultimately prevailed. The Homo usion, for which so much had been endured by Athanasians for over half a century, was given up and the Son was declared to be similar to‚Äîand not actually exactly equal or identical in essence with‚Äîthe God the Father. = Theological position = Homoianism (from gr. h√≥moios) declared that the Son was similar to God the Father, without reference to essence or substance. Some supporters of Homoian formulae also supported one of the other descriptions. Other Homoians declared that God the father was so incomparable and ineffably transcendent that even the ideas of likeness, similarity or identity in substance or essence with the subordinate Son and the Holy Spirit were heretical and not justified by the Gospels. They held that the Son was like the Father in some sense but that even to speak of \\"ousia\\" was impertinent speculation. Influences and decline It was Acacius and his followers who had managed the whole proceeding from the outset. By coming forward as advocates of temporizing methods, they had inspired the Eusebian or Semi-Arian party with the idea of throwing over Atius and his Anomoeans. As they had proved themselves in practice all through the course of the unlooked-for movement that brought them to the front, so were they now, in theory, the exponents of the Via Media of their day. The Acacians separated themselves from the Athanasians and Niceans, by the rejection of the word \\"homoousios\\"; from the Semi-Arians by their surrender of the \\"homoiousios\\"; and from the Aetians by their insistence upon the term homoios. They retained their influence as a distinct party just so long as their spokesman and leader Acacius enjoyed the favour of Constantius. Under Julian the Apostate, Atius, who had been exiled as the result of the proceedings at Seleucia, was allowed to regain his influence. The Acacians seized the occasion to make common cause with his ideas, but the alliance was only political; they threw him over once more at the Synod of Antioch held under Jovian in 363. In 365 the Semi-Arian Synod of Lampsacus condemned Acacius. His theological ideas were considered too extreme by the Semi-Arians. He was deposed from his seat, and with that event the history of the party to which he had given his name, in all practicality, ended.

Sex Roles, 12(1/2), 63-75. males and females between the ages of 20 and 28 were examined on their evaluations of same- and cross-sex friendships. Results showed a preference for same-sex relationship in both men and women. Cross-sex relationships were evaluated by men and women to be less helpful, and less loyal than same-sex friendships, and friendship formation was found to be different between cross-sex and same-sex relationships as well. Depending on the culture, and family and social structures, same-sex preferences have been found to develop between 3 and 9 years old.

As they looked into sex- segregation in childhood, the researchers found that segregation rose with age and that most Western children exhibit these preferences around 3‚Äì4 years old.

Kenyan children were not found to have sex- preference in playmates until the ages of 6 to 9 years old. Researchers observed 152 Kenyan children in rural settings and found that this change didn't occur until parental expectations and customary duties increased. \\"Just when and how such gender segregation appears, is the joint product of the individual and the culturally constructed niche\\" (Harkness & Super, 1985).Harkness, S., & Super, C.M. (1985). The cultural context of gender segregation in children's peer groups. Child Development, 56, 219-224. It appears that the social bias towards members of one's own sex can develop early in children. Specifically, studies have found that by the early age of 3 or 4, children prefer members of their own sex to members of the opposite sex (Bussey & Bandura, 1992).Bussey, K., & Bandura, A. (1992). Self-regulatory mechanisms governing gender development. Child Development, 63, 1236-1250. That is, young girls favor other females (girls and women) over males (boys and men). The findings are identical for young boys. Moreover, a study done by Carol Martin (1989)Martin, C. L. (1989) Children's use of gender-related information in making social judgments. Developmental Psychology, 25, 80-88. found that boys 4.5 years of age expressed significantly more dislike for a girl depicted as a \\"tomboy\\" than a boy depicted as a \\"sissy\\"; whereas boys 8.5 years of age express more dislike for a boy depicted as a \\"sissy\\". This age difference suggests that children as young as 4 prefer their own sex regardless of gender-incongruent behavior. Around the age of 8 however, boys begin to adhere to and appreciate the social expectations for males‚Äîdevaluing feminine behavior. It has also been shown that children ages 10‚Äì12 prefer same-sex socializing. That is, girls favored girls who socialized with other girls and boys liked boys who socialized with other boys.Lobel, T. E., Bempechat, J., Gewirtz, J. C., Shoken- Topaz, T., & Bashe, E. (1993).

Sexual orientation  Homosociality, by definition, implies neither heterosexuality nor homosexuality. For example, a heterosexual male who prefers to socialize with men may be considered a homosocial heterosexual. The term is often used by feminists to emphasize aspects of solidarity between males. Some feminists also identify a close link between female homosociality, feminism and lesbian desire, with Audre Lorde stating \\"the true feminist deals out of a lesbian consciousness whether or not she ever sleeps with women.\\" Historical uses Homosociality is a term sometimes used in discussions of the all-male world of knightly life in medieval culture. It is also used for historically largely male occupations such as being a sailor (for example, historian Marcus Rediker uses the term to describe the pirate world). Homosocial relationships are not obliged to be sexual relationships; they are merely same-sex social interactions. Predominantly homosocial arrangements include: *Single-sex educational institutions *Fraternities and sororities *Monasteries *Military (historically exclusively male, although presently both sexes are accepted in some forces) *Prisons *Yeshivot *Sports club teams, particularly geared toward single-sex membership or to one unique all-male or all-female sport *Exclusive male clubs or female clubs Generally, the more polarized the gender roles and restrictive the sexual code, the more homosociality one expects to find in a society.Gilbert H.

In the present General Roman Calendar, revised in 1969, Saints Nereus and Achilleus (together) and Saint Pancras have distinct celebrations (optional memorials) on 12 May. Saint Domitilla is not included in the revised calendar, because the liturgical honours once paid to her \\"have no basis in tradition\\".Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana), p. 123 The Tridentine Calendar had on 12 May a joint feast (semidouble rank) of Nereus, Achilleus and Pancras. The name of Domitilla was added in 1595. The joint celebration of Nereus, Achilleus, Domitilla and Pancras continued with that ranking (see General Roman Calendar of 1954) until the revision of 1960, when it was reclassified as a third-class feast (see General Roman Calendar of 1960). Nereus and Achilleus The old Roman lists of the 5th century, which passed over into the Martyrologium Hieronymianum, contain the names of the two martyrs Nereus and Achilleus, whose grave was in the Catacomb of Domitilla on the Via Ardeatina. Nereus and Achilleus are also mentioned in the \\"Sacramentarium Gelasianum\\". The basilica of Sts. Nereus and Achilleus in the Via Ardeatina (not to be confused with the church of the same name near the Baths of Caracalla to which the relics of the saints were translated in the 6th century), was erected above the burial site of the two saints and is of the latter part of the 4th century; it is a three-naved basilica, which was abandoned in the mid 9th century and rediscovered in 1874 by de Rossi in the Catacomb of Domitilla. Amongst the numerous objects found in the ruins were two pillars which had supported the ciborium ornamented with sculptures representing the death of the two saints by decapitation. The acts of these martyrs, legendary even to a romantic degree, have no historical value for their life and death. Saints Domitilla, Nereus, Achilleus, by Peter Paul Rubens. =Legend= According to these legends, Nereus and Achilleus were eunuchs and chamberlains of Flavia Domitilla, a niece of the Emperor Domitian; with the Christian virgin, they had been banished to the island of Ponza (Pontia), and later on beheaded in Terracina. The graves of these two martyrs were on an estate of the Lady Domitilla near the Via Ardeatina, close to that of Saint Petronilla. The author of this legend places the two saints quite differently from the poem of Pope Damasus: as Nereus and Achilleus were buried in a very ancient part of the catacomb of Domitilla, built as far back as the beginning of the 2nd century, we may conclude that they are among the most ancient martyrs of the Roman Church, and stand in very near relation to the Flavian family, of which Domitilla, the foundress of the catacomb, was a member. In the Epistle to the Romans, St. Paul mentions a Nereus with his sister, to whom he sends greetings (); perhaps even the martyr was a descendant of this disciple of the Apostle of the Gentiles. Owing to the purely legendary character of these Acts, we cannot use them as an argument to aid in the controversy whether there were two Christians of the name of Domitilla in the family of the Christian Flavian, or only one: the wife of the Consul Titus Flavius Clemens. As to other martyrs of the name Nereus, who are especially noted in the old martyrologies as martyrs of the faith in Africa, or as being natives of that country (e.g., in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum, 11 May, 15 or 16 October, 16 November) though there is one of the name in the present Roman Martyrology under date of 16 October, nothing more is known.

At the age of twenty he entered the monastery at Corbie in Picardy, a monastery that had been founded by queen Bathild, in 662. In order to be more secluded, he went to Monte Cassino, but was ordered by Charlemagne to return to Corbie, where he was elected abbot. At the same time Charlemagne made him prime minister to his son Pepin, King of Italy, in the Carolingian Empire.Ott, Michael. \\"St. Adalard.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1.

When, in 817, Bernard, son of Pepin, aspired to the imperial crown, emperor Louis the Pious suspected Adalard of being in sympathy with Bernard and banished him to Hermoutier, the modern Noirmoutier, on the island of the same name. Adalard's brother Wala was obliged to become a monk at Corbie.McKitterick, Rosamond. (1983). The Frankish Kingdoms under the Carolingians, 751‚Äì987. London: Longman. After seven years Louis saw his mistake and made Adalard one of his chief advisers. Several hospitals were erected by him. In 822 Adalard and his brother Wala founded Corvey Abbey (\\"New Corbie\\") in Westphalia. Corwey was an imperial abbey; its territory extending from the bishopric of Paderborn to the duchy of Brunswick. Its abbot was one of the eleven abbots, who sat with twenty-one bishops in the imperial diet at Regensburg. Adalard was returning from Corvey to old Corbie, when he fell sick three days before Christmas: he died about three in the afternoon, on January 1 in the year 827, at the age of seventy-three.

Name \\"Aidan\\" is a diminutive form of the Gaelic name Aodh, Aedh, or Aed.Baring-Gould, Sabine & al. The Lives of the British Saints: The Saints of Wales and Cornwall and Such Irish Saints as Have Dedications in Britain, Vol. I, pp. 122 ff. Chas. Clark (London), 1908. Hosted at Archive.org. Accessed 18 Nov 2014. The name meant \\"fire\\" and is related to the god of the underworld in Irish mythology, although it was also used as a form of the Latin name Dominus. It was formerly often anglicized as Hugh. \\"Madoc\\" and \\"Mogue\\" are other pet forms of Aodh, formed from the diminutive suffix -og and the Irish affectionate prefix mo-, meaning something like \\"my dear little Aedh\\". In some Welsh sources, he appears as Aeddan Foeddog or Foeddawg; the epithet Foeddog is merely a mutated reduplication of his name: Aeddan Maedoc. Life He was born at Inisbrefny (an island in Templeport Lake) then in the area known as Magh Sl√©cht, now the parish of Templeport, County Cavan, about 558.Toke, Leslie. \\"St. Maedoc.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 22 Jan. 2014 In the Welsh genealogies of the saints, Aeddan is called the son of Gildas or Aneurin, sons of Caw, king of Strathclyde; Irish sources instead make him a son of Sedna, a chieftain of Connaught, and his wife, Eithne. He was a first cousin of St. Dall√°n Forgaill. These separate origins, his work in Wales, the extraordinary span of Aidan's activity, and the appearance of two dates of death has led some scholars--such as Sabine Baring-Gould--to propose that the existing stories of Maedoc are a conflation of two separate Aeds, one Welsh and one Irish, who served as bishop of Ferns a generation apart. Still other inconsistencies seem to be related to confusion of these Aeds with Aed mac Bricc, who preceded them and possibly participated in the cursing of Tara with Saint Ruadh√°n. Irish legend says that the \\"Bell of St. Mogue\\" was given to the infant on his birth by Saint Caill√≠n.\\"The Breac Maedoc on loan from the National Museum of Ireland\\", Cavan County Museum When a boat could not be found to take the infant Aedan across the lake to where Caill√≠n waited to baptize him, Aedan was floated to shore on a slab of stone. The font at St Mogue's in Bawnboy is said to be made from part of the stone. As a youth, Aedan was a hostage of Ainmuire mac S√©tnai of the Cen√©l Conaill, High King of Ireland. Ainmire was so impressed with Aedan that he told him he could stay or go. Aedan said he would go, but only if the other hostages were also released, whereupon Ainmire let them all return home.Plummer, Charles. \\"Life of Maedoc of Ferns\\", Bethada Naem nErren, Clarendon Press, Oxford, (1922) He studied at the great school of Saint Finnian at Clonard Abbey. While at Clonard, Aedan made friends with Molaise, who would later found the monastery of Devenish Island on the River Erne. By this point, many began to come to the young man desiring to become his disciples. Instead of indulging them, he fled from Ireland to Wales to study under St. David. (Welsh legends, meanwhile, simply place his upbringing with David and go into great detail concerning attempts on his life by David's steward.) Along with Saint Cadoc, he was said to have exterminated an army of Saxons or Irishmen by rolling stones upon their camp in a narrow valley. He was listed in the Welsh triads as one of David's three most faithful disciples. He returned to Ireland in 570, landing on the coast of Wexford with hives of bees, which he had been told were scarce on the island. He landed as some locals were plundering another group of strangers and his quick response impressed the local chieftain, who granted him lands for religious communities. He then settled at Brentrocht in Leinster. Aidan is said to have fasted for seven years, during this period he ate only barley bread with water.Somerville-Large, Peter. (1975). Irish Eccentrics: A Selection. Hamish Hamilton. p. 20 Aidan seems to have played a role in the king of Leinster's defeat over the U√≠ N√©ill High King √Åed mac Ainmuirech of the Cen√©l Conaill at the Battle of D√∫n Bolg in 598, either (according to the hagiographers) through the intercession of his prayers or (according to the poets of the B√≥roma Laigen) through a failed peace embassy followed by the successful idea to sneak Leinster's soldiers into the enemy camp inside food baskets.Wiley, Dan M. Boroma, The Cycles of the Kings. However the Aidan, Bishop of Glendalough, referred to in the tale is unlikely to have been St. M√°ed√≥c as they had different mothers. Maed√≥c's mother was Eithne while Aidan's mother was Br√≠g, daughter of Chobtaig m. Crimthann mac √ânnai m. √ânnae Cennsalach of the U√≠ Ceinnselaig dynasty from Leinster'Corpus Genealogiarum Sanctorum Hiberniae', √ì Riain, P√°draig, ed., Dublin: Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1985, ¬ß380.1. The grateful King Brandubh then granted him Ferns in County Wexford, where he established a monastery. The influence of Brandubh also convened a synod whereat Ferns was not merely constituted a see but its bishop Aedan was also given nominal supremacy over the other Leinster bishops as their Chief Bishop (). He was noted for his benevolence and hospitality:Webb, Alfred. \\"Saint Aedan, Maedoc or Mogue\\", A Compendium of Irish Biography, M.H. Gill & Son, Dublin (1878) on one occasion, seeing them exhausted by their journey, he permitted beef to be given to a visiting delegation of British bishops during Lent and permitted them to excuse themselves with the claim that the slaughtered cow was merely \\"milk and vegetables in condensed form\\" whereas the whey and biscuits the other monks consumed had so many weevils as to occasion \\"conscientious scruples\\". On another, he was pushed into a lake to see whether he would lose his temper; upon his meekly restoring himself, his tormenter confessed himself and apologized. He was also credited with a large number of foundations in the region. Aeddan himself died on 31 January 632 on Lough Melvin's shore in County Leitrim. His relics are claimed by St. Edan's in Ferns. His stone tomb is inside the cathedral, although his remains are in the original cathedral crypt below. The Breac Maedoc (his shrine) dates from the 9th century and is an example of an early medieval reliquary. It was often used as a sacred object upon which to swear binding oaths. It was acquired by the National Museum of Ireland in the 1890s. Miracles Many miracles are recorded of St. Maedoc during his sojourn in Wales. He was said to have broken a jug while fetching ale for his fellow monks; making the sign of the cross over the shards, however, it was repaired and he continued on his errand. A yoke given to him by David's steward purposefully too small to fit the necks of his oxen miraculously accommodated them and permitted him to bring the necessary materials for Llanddewi Velfrey. Following his return to Ireland, a local begged him for some meal as he was grinding flour and, after receiving some, disguised himself as a blind man to come back and beg for more. Annoyed, the saint cursed him that the generations of his descendants would never lack for a blind member. Another time, wolves devoured a calf at one of his monasteries; its mother being inconsolable, Aedan blessed the head of his cook and told him to offer it to the heifer, which licked him and thenceforth \\"loved him like a calf\\". When asked by Saint Fintan Munnu to heal monks suffering under an epidemic, Aedan was said to have indulged him: first by curing the monks and then by permitting the sickness to resume when Saint Fintan changed his mind, considering the sickness to be good for their souls. His hagiographers credited Aidan's curses with Brandubh's defeat of the U√≠ N√©ill; they further state that, when Sar√°n slew his father-in-law, he attempted to accommodate the saint only for Aidan to curse him that his right hand would wither to the stump. When Sar√°n begged for a penance, Aidan directed him to pray for forgiveness at Brandubh's tomb in Ferns; when Sar√°n did so, a voice from the crypt forgave him. He lost his hand regardless. Miraculous blessings from Aidan were credited with King Brandubh's victory at D√∫n Bolg in 598; with the selection of his successor Dachua (Mochua Luachra); and with the success of the Irish architect Gob√°n Saor. Legacy He is the patron saint of Hy Kinsellagh or Wexford;http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/SaintAedanMaedocorMogue.php Ferns; and Templeport in County Cavan. His feast is commemorated in Bawnboy with prayerful visits to his church and to the island where he was born. Mogue is no longer used as a Christian name but the name Aidan is popular for boys in the West Cavan area. The Catholic episcopal seat formerly located at Ferns (prior to its destruction) is now at St. Aidan's Cathedral in Enniscorthy, although the bishop resides at Wexford. The Anglican diocese is administered from Kilkenny, although St. Edan's Cathedral in Ferns remains the seat of Church of Ireland diocese (itself part of the United Dioceses of Cashel and Ossory). St. Edan's is located on the site (and partially includes the ruins) of the earlier Catholic cathedral, which was burnt down in 1575 by the O'Byrnes of Wicklow. It was ordered to be rebuilt by Queen Elizabeth I during her reign, but was only half rebuilt. It is now known as Europe's smallest Cathedral. (St. Edan's does not necessarily celebrate his feast on its day, but rather on the nearest Sunday.) Aedan is credited as the founder of thirty churches and a number of monasteries. The first of these monasteries was on the island of his birth, now the site of 18th-century ruins and burial ground. (The clay or mortar from the ruins of the church is said to provide protection against fire or drowning and is kept by many local people in their homes.) Other monasteries include Drumlane (near Milltown in County Cavan); at Ferns in County Wexford; at Dissert-Nairbre in County Waterford; and at Rossinver near the site of his death. The church of Llawhaden in Pembrokeshire, Wales, also commemorates him near the site of a ford he supposedly discovered while leading his oxen.

St. Francis called him \\"The Knight of our Round Table\\". Life Of Giles' origins and early life nothing certain is known, other than that he was a simple farmer. In April, 1209, moved by the example of two leading fellow-Assisians, who had already become the first followers of St. Francis, he begged permission to join the little band, and on the feast of St. George (23 April) was invested in a poor religious habit which St. Francis had begged for him. Almost immediately afterwards he set out with St. Francis to preach in the Marches of Ancona. He accompanied Francis of Assisi to Rome when the first Rule was approved orally by Pope Innocent III, and appears to have then received the monastic tonsure.Robinson, Paschal. \\"Bl. Aegidius of Assisi.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 6 January 2020 About 1212 Giles made a pilgrimage to the tomb of St. James at Compostella, in Spain. Shortly after his return to Assisi he started for Jerusalem, to venerate the Holy Places, visiting on his way home the Italian shrines of St. Michael, at Monte Gargano, and St. Nicholas, at Bari. He is next found in Rome and still later at Tunis. In these journeys Giles was always at pains to procure by manual labor what food and shelter he needed. At Ancona he made reed baskets; at Brindisi he carried water and helped to bury the dead; at Rome he cut wood, trod the wine-press, and gathered nuts; while the guest of a cardinal at Rieti he insisted on sweeping the house and cleaning the knives. A keen observer of men and events, Giles acquired in the course of these travels much valuable knowledge and experience, which he turned to good account. For he lost no occasion to preach to the people. His sermons, if such they can be called, were brief and heartfelt talks, replete with homely wisdom; he never minced his words, but spoke to all with apostolic freedom. After some years of activity Giles was assigned by St. Francis to the hermitage of Monteripido, outside Perugia, where he began a life of contemplation and ecstasy which continued with very visible increase until his death.Arnald of Sarrant, Chronicle of the Twenty-Four Generals of the Order of Friars Minor, (Noel Muscat ofm, trans.) Ordo Fratrum Minorum. Malta, 2010 It was in 1262, on the fifty-second anniversary of his reception into the Order of Friars Minor, that Giles died, already revered as a saint. His immemorial cultus was confirmed by Pope Pius VI in 1777, and his feast day is celebrated on the 23 April.‚ÄúBlessed Aegidius of Assisi‚Äù. New Catholic Dictionary. CatholicSaints.Info. 27 July 2012 Giles was a stranger to theological and classical learning, but by constant contemplation of heavenly things, and by the divine love with which he was inflamed, he acquired that fullness of holy wisdom which filled his contemporaries with wonder, and which drew men of every condition, even the Pope himself, to Perugia to hear from Giles' lips the Word of Life. The answers and advice these visitors received were remembered, talked over, and committed to writing, and thus was formed a collection of the familiar \\"Dicta\\" or \\"Sayings\\" of Brother Giles, which have often been edited in Latin and translated into different languages. St. Bonaventure held these \\"Sayings\\" in high esteem, and they are cited in the works of many subsequent ascetical writers. They are short, pithy, popular counsels on Christian perfection, applicable to all classes. Saturated with mysticism, yet exquisitely human and possessing a picturesque vein of originality, they faithfully reflect the early Franciscan spirit and teaching.

He was an important member of the community founded by St. M√°el Ruain at Tallaght (now in South Dublin), in the borderlands of Leinster. M√°el Ruain is described as his mentor (aite, also \\"fosterfather\\"). There are reasons for believing that √ìengus was ordained to the office of bishop, a denomination which is first assigned to him in a list of saints inserted into the Martyrology of Tallaght (see below). If so, his influence may well have extended to the reformed communities which were associated with Tallaght, many of which were founded in √ìengus's lifetime. In fact, two such monasteries in Co. Limerick and Co. Laois, both of them known as D√≠sert √ìengusa (\\"√ìengus's Hermitage\\"), bear his memory in name. Writings Excerpt from the Martyrology of Oengus, presenting the entries for 1 and 2 January in the form of quatrains of four six-syllabic lines for each day. In this 16th-century copy (MS G10 at the National Library of Ireland) we find pairs of two six-syllabic lines combined into bold lines, amended by glosses and notes that were added by later authors. =F√©lire √ìengusso= The literary effort most commonly attributed to √ìengus is the Old Irish work known as F√©lire √ìengusso (\\"Martyrology of √ìengus\\"), which is the earliest metrical martyrology ‚Äî a register of saints and their feast days ‚Äì to have been written in the vernacular. The work survives in at least ten manuscripts, the earliest being Leabhar Breac of the early 15th century. The martyrology proper consists of 365 quatrains, one for each day of the year, and is framed between a lengthy prologue and epilogue. Later scribes added a prose preface, including material on √ìengus, and accompanied the text with abundant glosses and scholia. √ìengus's principal source was the Martyrology of Tallaght, an abbreviated version in prose of the Martyrologium Hieronymianum, but with a multitude of Irish saints added to their respective feastdays. Other sources are given in the epilogue as an \\"antigraph of Jerome, the martyrology of Eusebius\\" and \\"Ireland's host of books.\\"F√©lire √ìengusso, lines 137‚Äì41. √ì Riain, \\"√ìengus of Tallaght.\\" ODNB. Dating the calendar The precise date of the original composition has proved difficult to ascertain. The usual method of determining a terminus post quem has been to argue from the careers of saints and kings referred to in the text, many of whom remain obscure. The terminus ante quem is a different game. In view of the selective nature of the F√©lire, arguments from silence have little to recommend it, at least in individual cases.Dumville, \\"F√©lire √ìengusso.\\" 26, 36. What would have been instructive, the year of √ìengus's death, is unknown, but his education by M√°el Ruain (d. 792) must at least mean that he did not outlive the 9th century.Dumville, \\"F√©lire √ìengusso.\\" 28. The one thing that is usually accepted is that it was written no earlier than 797, when one of the rulers described in the prologue as having deceased, Donnchad mac Domnaill, king of Tara, died.Donnchad dric ruad rogdae \\"Donnchad the wrathful, ruddy, chosen\\", F√©lire √ìengusso 221; Dumville, \\"F√©lire √ìengusso.\\" p. 25. Rudolf Thurneysen postulated a date before 808 on grounds that the reference to the death of Bran Ardchenn mac Muiredaig (d. probably 795), king of Leinster, should be attributed to political sympathies in the reign of his successor F√≠nsnechta mac Cellaig (d. 808).Thurneysen, \\"Die Abfassung des F√©lire von Oengus.\\" √ì Riain, however, has rejected the traditional date (797 x 808) in favour of a later range, between 828 and 833, while more recently, Dumville has cast doubt on √ì Riain's conclusions and dating methods. First, √ì Riain argues that such sympathies as Thurneysen refers to are pertinent only to the next kings in the royal line, Cellach mac Brain (r. 829‚Äì834) and Conchobar mac Donnchada (r. 819‚Äì833), sons of Bran and Donnchad respectively.√ì Riain, \\"The Tallaght martyrologies redated.\\" pp. 37‚Äì8. Dumville objects that this political argument glosses over the probability that while Bran and Donnchad gave way to overlords from rival dynasties, they were nevertheless succeeded by members of their family in their own tuatha or m√≥rthuatha. The inclusion of these kings in the prologue therefore offers no good reason to move up the terminus ante quem.Dumville, \\"F√©lire √ìengusso.\\" 28-9. Second, √ì Riain sees reason to identify the saints Airer√°n (11 August), Mod√≠m√≥c (10 December) and Flann (14 January) with Airfhinn√°n (d. 803), abbot of Tallaght, D√≠mm√°n of Araid (d. 811) and Flann mac Fairchellaig (d. 825), abbot of Lismore. Dumville, however, points out a number of weaknesses and concludes with Stokes \\"that no saint or other person who certainly died in the ninth century is mentioned.\\"Dumville, \\"F√©lire √ìengusso.\\" pp. 26, 29‚Äì30. Third, having identified a number of saints in the Martyrology of Tallaght, the primary model for the F√©lire, he proposes obits extending to that of St Teimn√©n or St Temn√°n of Linn Duachaill, who died in 828.√ì Riain, \\"The Tallaght martyrologies redated.\\" 26 ff. In Dumville's view, the evidence is ambiguous, since the relationship of the extant copies of the Martyrology of Tallaght to the lost original which served as the source for the F√©lire is yet unclear.Dumville, \\"F√©lire √ìengusso.\\" 37-8, 46. Liam Breatnach has also supported Thurneysen's date.Breatnach, \\"Poets and Poetry\\" in McCone and Simms (eds), Progress in medieval Irish studies (Maynooth, 1996, pp. 65-77. Centres of worldly and spiritual power Something of √ìengus' view on secular politics appears to come through in his prologue to the F√©lire. In a number of stanzas, the deserted sites of Tara, Cr√∫achan (also Cr√∫achu) and Emain Machae are interpreted as the former sites of fortresses in which powerful rulers resided before the coming of Christianity. These pagan seats of power are contrasted with the great ecclesiastical centres of Ireland which were flourishing in √ìengus' own time, such as Armagh and Clonmacnoise.F√©lire √ìengusso, ed. Stokes, p. 24. According to the historian T.M. Charles-Edwards, √ìengus was responding to the military domination of overlords of his day, commenting that worldly glory is transient, while spiritual power is enduring. To similar effect, √ìengus also holds up the example of M√°el Ruain, who continues to offer support and comfort after his death, against that of the contemporary warrior-kings Donnchadh and Bran Ardchenn, whose strong exercise of power meant no such thing after theirs.Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland. 469-70. =Martyrology of Tallaght= It has been suggested that √ìengus was actively involved in the compilation if not the composition of the augmented Martyrology of Tallaght. This was a work of Northumbrian provenance, probably from Lindisfarne, which first passed through Iona and Bangor, where Irish scribes began to make some additions. The manuscript (now lost) finally arrived in Tallaght, where it received the majority of its Irish additions. It was written by someone of √ìengus's learning and literary skill at Tallaght and there are strong indications that this was √ìengus himself: first of all, the sources named by √ìengus in the epilogue to the F√©lire (see above) would make more sense if these were the materials used for the Martyrology of Tallaght; second, a number of saints whom the same epilogue claims to have included are found in the Martyrology of Tallaght, but not in the actual F√©lire. Death According to the Martyrology of Tallaght, √ìengus's feast-day, and hence the date of his death, is 11 March. The poem beginning A√≠bind suide sund amne claims that he died on a Friday in D√≠sert Bethech (\\"The Birchen Hermitage\\").A√≠bind suide sund amne, stanza 3. Together, these have produced a range of possible dates such as 819, 824 and 830, but pending the dates of the martyrologies, no conclusive answer can be offered.Dumville, \\"F√©lire √ìengusso\\", p. 27. His metrical Life tells that he was buried in his birthplace Clonenagh.A√≠bind suide sund amne, stanza 4. Reputation Becoming a hermit, he lived for a time at -beagh, where, on the banks of the Nore, he is said to have communed with the angels. From his love of prayer and solitude he was named the \\"Culdee\\"; in other words, the Ceile D√©, or \\"Servant of God.\\" Not satisfied with his hermitage, which was only a mile from Clonenagh, and, therefore, liable to be disturbed by students or wayfarers, √ìengus removed to a more solitary abode eight miles distant. This sequestered place, two miles southeast of the present town of Maryborough, was called after him \\"the Desert of √ìengus\\", or \\"Dysert-Enos\\". Here he erected a little oratory on a gentle eminence among the Dysert Hills, now represented by a ruined and deserted Protestant church. He is also claimed to have founded D√≠sert √ìengusa near to Croom, c. AD 780. His earliest biographer in the ninth century relates the wonderful austerities practised by St. √ìengus in his \\"desert\\", and though he sought to be far from the haunts of men, his fame attracted a stream of visitors. The result was that the good saint abandoned his oratory at Dysert- Enos, and, after some wanderings, came to the monastery of Tallaght, near Dublin, then governed by St. Maelruain. He entered as a lay brother, concealing his identity, but St. Maelruain soon discovered him and collaborated with him on the Martyrology of Tallaght.

The relationships that give rise to the impediment have varied over time. Marriages and sexual relations between people in an affinity relationship are regarded as incestuous. Today, the relevant principle within the Catholic Church is that \\"affinity does not beget affinity\\"‚Äîi.e., there is no affinity between one spouse's relatives and the other spouse's relatives. Canon 109 of the Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church provides that affinity is an impediment to the marriage of a couple, and is a relationship which \\"arises from a valid marriage, even if not consummated, and exists between a man and the blood relatives of the woman and between the woman and the blood relatives of the man.\\"1983 Codex Juris Canonici, New English Translation (Washington DC: Canon Law Society of America, 1999), Can. 1092 ¬ß1 Also, affinity \\"is reckoned in such a way that the blood relations of the man are related by affinity to the woman in the same line and the same degree, and vice versa.\\"1983 Codex Juris Canonici, New English Translation (Washington DC: Canon Law Society of America, 1999), Can. 109 ¬ß2 Historical development =Mosaic law= In the Hebrew Bible, and contain prohibitions of sexual relations between a couple in a consanguineous relationship, as well as a number of prohibitions of certain affinity relationships, e.g., (father's wife), (father's brother's wife), (brother's wife), (wife's sister), (father's wife, daughter-in-law), (woman and her mother), (sister of either one's mother or father) and (brother's wife). Marriage to a brother's widow is prohibited, but not to a deceased wife's sister.Patrick Colquhoun, A Summary of the Roman Civil Law, Illustrated by Commentaries on and Parallels from the Mosaic, Canon, Mohammedan, English, and Foreign Law (London: Wm. Benning & Co., 1849), p. 518 & ns. 10‚Äì13 However, as an exception, requires a brother to marry his brother's widow if the brother died without issue, in a so-called levirate marriage. =Roman law= Roman civil law prohibited marriages within four degrees of consanguinityPatrick Colquhoun, A Summary of the Roman Civil Law, Illustrated by Commentaries on and Parallels from the Mosaic, Canon, Mohammedan, English, and Foreign Law (London: Wm. Benning & Co., 1849), p. 513 but had no degrees of affinity with regards to marriage. However, the rule was that, if an issue of affinity arose, at whatever consanguineal level a couple was joined was considered the same level as regarded affinity.Patrick Colquhoun, A Summary of the Roman Civil Law, Illustrated by Commentaries on and Parallels from the Mosaic, Canon, Mohammedan, English, and Foreign Law (London: Wm. Benning & Co., 1849), p. 514 Roman civil laws prohibited any marriage between parents and children, either in the ascending or descending line ad infinitum. Adoption was considered the same as affinity in that an adoptive father could not marry an unemancipated daughter or granddaughter even if the adoption had been dissolved. Slaves, as such, could not contract a legal marriage, but if freed were then subject to the general rules.Patrick Colquhoun, A Summary of the Roman Civil Law, Illustrated by Commentaries on and Parallels from the Mosaic, Canon, Mohammedan, English, and Foreign Law (London: Wm. Benning & Co., 1849), p. 510 Also a marriage contracted within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity if contracted bona fide, out of ignorance of any impediments, is allowed to stand and any children of this union were considered legitimate. =Historical Catholic canon law= Regarding itself as not being bound by Old Testament commandments, the early Christian church followed Roman civil law, as the law of the land.Brendan F. Brown, 'The Canon Law of Marriage', Virginia Law Review, Vol. 26, No. 1 (Nov., 1939), p. 82 n. 54 The Christian emperors modified the rules from time to time and extended the civil law impediment to the first degree of collateral affinity. The church extended the impediment to relationships created by illicit intercourse. The Council of Elvira (c. 300), prohibited the marriage of a widower with his deceased wife's sister.R. Burtsell, 'Affinity (in Canon Law)', The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907) also online at New Advent The prohibition became slowly more extensive. By the early 9th century the Western Church had increased the number of prohibited degrees of consanguinity from four to seven.Constance B. Bouchard, 'Consanguinity and Noble Marriages in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries', Speculum, Vol. 56, No. 2 (Apr., 1981), pp. 269‚Äì70 The method of calculating relationships was also changed to simply count the number of generations back to a common ancestor. The church also prohibited affinity to the same seven degrees. While the impediment of affinity is close to but not as compelling as that of consanguinity, the reasoning behind the prohibited degrees of affinity being treated the same as that of consanguinity is the nearness to the blood relatives by the very act of sexual intercourse. Prior to the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), the Church recognized two additional forms of affinity. Firstly, when a man married a widow, her relatives as well as those of her former husband were considered the man's relatives and treated as if they were his blood relatives. Secondly, if the woman's first husband had been a widower then the blood relatives of his first wife became the woman's relatives and by her subsequent marriage, were also the new husband's relatives by affinity. Also, a woman's children by a deceased husband, as well as the children of her husband by a deceased wife, were considered related by affinity. So the subsequent marriages of step-siblings carried the same prohibitions as if they were related by blood. The principle established was \\"affinity begot affinity.\\" The Fourth Lateran Council removed the second type of affinity rule and the new axiom became: \\"affinity does not beget affinity\\", which is the principle followed in the modern Catholic church. It also limited both affinity and consanguinity prohibitions to the fourth degree, but retained the same method of calculating, counting back to a common ancestor.The History of Medieval Canon Law in the Classical Period, 1140‚Äì1234; From Gratian to the Decretals of Pope Gregory IX, ed. Wilfried Harimann; Kenneth Pennington (The Catholic University of America Press, 2008), p. 350 The Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563) limited the impediment to marriage on account of affinity in cases when the affinity is created out of marriage (e.g., by force or extra- matrimonial intercourse) to the second degree of affinity. =Dispensation= As the affinity rules have their origin in ecclesiastical and not divine law, impediments can be dispensed by the competent Church authority. The Pope or a bishop may grant a dispensation to a marriage when the affinity rules would be breached. Contemporary Christian positions The present Catholic church position is that affinity is covered by ecclesiastical law and bishops are permitted to dispense any impediments, short of any order of priesthood or affinity in the direct line, if it stems from lawful sexual relationships. The modern laws of the Anglican Church regarding affinity are found in the Book of Common Prayer, which were revised from time to time. The Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907 removed the impediment to marrying a late wife's sister. Restrictions were also relaxed by the Marriage Act 1949 s. 1 and the Marriage (Prohibited Degrees of Relationship) Act 1986 s. 1.Will Adam, Legal Flexibility and the Mission of the Church: Dispensation and Economy in Ecclesiastical Law (Farnham, Surrey, England; Burlington, Vt.: Ashgate, 2011), p. 72 and n. 32 The Anglican Communion allows marriages beyond the second degree of affinity.Book of Common Prayer, Anglican Church of Canada (1962) p. 562. The Eastern Orthodox Church relationship prohibitions because of affinity follow (father's wife), (father's brother's wife), (brother's wife), (wife's sister), (father's wife, daughter-in-law), (woman and her mother), (sister of either one's mother or father) and (brother's wife). However, the Greek patriarchs and bishops may grant dispensations with a certain degree of freedom or choose to adhere to the letter of the law.Ernst Benz, The Eastern Orthodox Church: Its Thought and Life (Piscataway, New Jersey: AldineTransaction, 2009), p. 69 The Nestorian Church has few restrictions on affinity begetting affinity. The Armenian Apostolic Church restricts affinity to the fourth degree, while the policy of Oriental Orthodoxy in general is very close to that of the Roman Catholic canons. Conservative Lutherans also prohibit marriage within close degrees of affinity, even if not specifically outlawed by the state.Christian Cyclopedia article on Impediments to Marriage.

Some Latin controversialists have responded by assailing the Greeks as \\"Fermentarians\\" and \\"Prozymites\\". History The Western Church has always maintained the validity of consecration with either leavened bread or unleavened bread. Whether the bread which Jesus used at the Last Supper was leavened or unleavened is the central question giving rise to this issue. Various arguments exist for which kind was used. Regarding the usage of the primitive Church, knowledge is so scant, and the testimonies so apparently contradictory, that many theologians have pronounced the problem incapable of definitive solution. In the ninth century the use of unleavened bread had become universal and obligatory in the West, while the Greeks, desirous of emphasizing the distinction between the Jewish and the Christian Pasch, continued the exclusive offering of leavened bread. Photius made no use of a point of attack which occupies a prominent place in later Orthodox polemics. The western explanation is that Photius saw that the position of the Latins could not successfully be assailed. Two centuries later, the quarrel with Rome was resumed by a patriarch who was not deterred by this consideration. As a visible symbol of Catholic unity, it had been the custom to maintain Greek churches and monasteries in Rome and some of Latin Rite in Constantinople. The issue became divisive when the provinces of Byzantine Italy which were under the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople were forcibly incorporated into the Church of Rome following their invasion by the Norman armies, said churches which were forced by Rome to use unleavened bread. In response, Michael Cerularius ordered all the Latin churches in the Byzantine capital to be closed, and the Latin monks to be expelled. At first Pope Leo IX was cautious of the Normans but he came to appreciate their usefulness to the papacy in ousting the Byzantine authority in the south. Within two years of Leo's death the Normans had secured the papacy and placed one of their own men on the papal throne, Pope Stephen IX. Patriarch Michael Cerularius was responding to a concrete situation within his territory ‚Äì the persecution of the Byzantine Italians in southern Italy, the closing of their churches, the prohibition of their Rite, the removal of their bishops and the imposition of the Latin unleavened bread for the Eucharist. This enforced change in the Byzantine provinces of southern Italy (which brought about the extinction of the Byzantine traditions there), causing anti-Italian riots in Constantinople and the decision of the Patriarch to close the Latin churches in the imperial city. As a dogmatic justification of this act, he advanced the novel tenet that the unleavened oblation of the \\"Franks\\" was not a valid Mass. The proclamation of war with the Pope and the West was drawn up by his chief lieutenant, Leo of Achrida, metropolitan of the Bulgarians. It was in the form of a letter addressed to John, Bishop of Trani, in Apulia, at the time subject to the Byzantine emperor, and by decree of Leo the Isaurian attached to the Eastern Patriarchate. John was commanded to have the letter translated into Latin and communicated to the Pope and the Western bishops. This was done by the learned Benedictine, Cardinal Humbert, who happened to be present in Trani when the letter arrived. Baronius has preserved the Latin version; Cardinal Hergenr√∂ther discovered the original Greek text: This validity of the etymological reasoning with the terms artos from airo was and is disputed. The Latin divines found a number of passages in Scripture where unleavened bread is designated as artos. Cardinal Humbert recalled the places where the unleavened loaves of proposition are called artoi. In the Septuagint, one can find the expression artous azymous in Ex., xxix, 2. Cerularius found the issue politically useful in his conflict with the Latins. In popular opinion, the flour and water wafers of the \\"Franks\\" were not bread; their sacrifices were invalid; they were Jews not Christians. Their lifeless bread could only symbolize a soulless Christ; therefore, they had clearly fallen into the heresy of Apollinaris. The controversy became a key factor in producing the East‚ÄìWest Schism, which persists to this day. This question of azyms brought forth a cloud of pamphlets, and made a deeper impression on the popular imagination than the abstruse controversy of the Filioque. But it caused little or no discussion among the theologians at the Councils of Lyons and Florence. At the latter Council the Greeks admitted the Latin contention that the consecration of the elements was equally valid with leavened and unleavened bread; it was decreed that the priests of either rite should conform to the custom of their respective Church. Modern Russians have claimed for their nation the initiation of the azymes controversy; but the treatises ascribed to Leontius, Bishop of Kiev, who lived a century earlier than Cerularius, and in which all the well-known arguments of the Greeks are rehearsed, are judged to have proceeded from a later pen.

From here they were moved to the recently opened Colebrook Home in Quorn run by the Mission. Marriage In 1979 she married Gordon Smart, a medical orderly at the Repatriation Hospital whom she had first met in 1964. He died in 1992. He had six adult children from a previous marriage;Lawrence Money, \\"The good life\\", The Age, 6 December 2014, Spectrum, p. 4 they had no children of their own. Following her retirement, she formally added the name Lowitja (an Aboriginal phonetic adaptation of her given name Lois) to her existing legal name, Lois O'Donoghue Smart, to emphasize her Luritjan Aboriginal heritage. Education According to O'Donoghue she was very happy living at Colebrook and said she received a sound education both there and at the Quorn Primary School. The Quorn community at large actively encouraged children from the home to participate in local events, and assisted in the maintenance of the home. Only a few people objected to the integration. In 1944 Colebrook Home moved to Eden Hills, South Australia, due to chronic water shortages, enabling her to attend Unley High School, a local public school, and obtain her Intermediate Certificate. She was taught up until the Leaving Certificate standard but did not sit for the examination. At Colebrook Home the elder children assisted in taking care of younger children. Thus, with this experience, at the age of 16, Lois O'Donoghue's first job was as a nanny looking after six children with a family in Victor Harbor some 85 km south of Adelaide. While attending the Baptist church there she was persuaded by the Matron of the South Coast District Hospital to take up nursing as a career. Nursing career =Royal Adelaide Hospital= From 1950‚Äì53 O'Donoghue worked as a nursing aide in Victor Harbor. The small hospital did not run a comprehensive training course, so with the strong support and assistance of the matron, she applied to be a student nurse in Adelaide. After a long struggle to win admission to a training hospital, she became the first black nurse in South Australia. The Royal Adelaide Hospital policy at that time was to only take nursing students who had obtained their leaving certificate, so initially they would not consider taking her. Shortly afterwards the hospital introduced a plan to allow deserving students to be accepted without the necessary educational qualifications. In 1954, she was in the first intake of unqualified students to attend the Royal Adelaide Hospital, which offered good nursing career prospects. She qualified as a nurse and worked at the Royal Adelaide until 1961, being appointed a charge nurse just before leaving. =India= She spent time with the Baptist Church working in Assam, northern India as a nurse relieving missionaries who were taking leave back in Australia. Due to the nearby Sino-Indian War she was advised by the Australian government to evacuate to Calcutta, from where she would depart for her return to Australia. South Australian public servant After returning in 1962, she worked as an aboriginal liaison officer with the South Australian Department of Education. She later transferred to the SA Department of Aboriginal Affairs and was employed as a welfare officer based mainly in the north of the state, in particular at Coober Pedy, some 200 kilometres south of her birthplace. Commonwealth public service =Department of Aboriginal Affairs= In 1967 O'Donoghue joined the Commonwealth Public Service as a junior administrative officer in the Adelaide office of the newly formed Department of Aboriginal Affairs. After eight years she became the Director of the Department's office in South Australia, a senior officer position, responsible for the local implementation of national Aboriginal welfare policy. After a short while she left the public service and had various management/administrative roles with non-government organisations. She was appointed by the Government as chairperson of the Aboriginal Development Commission. =Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission= In 1990 O'Donoghue was appointed Chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, a position she held until 1996. In 1991, with Alf Bamblett and Steve Gordon, she became one of the first Aboriginal people to attend a cabinet meeting. O'Donoghue used this occasion to put forward ATSIC's position with regard to the government's response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. In December 1992, O'Donoghue became the first Aboriginal Australian to address the United Nations General Assembly during the launch of the United Nations International Year of Indigenous People. She was replaced as Chairperson by Gatjil Djerrkura, who was considered by the Howard Government to be more moderate. Identity Lowitja was a chairperson of the National Aboriginal Conference for a short time in the early 1980s before it was dissolved due to internal disputes on its direction. Member of the Stolen Generations After the publication of the Bringing Them Home report in 1997, she said she preferred the word \\"removed\\" to the word \\"stolen\\" (as used in Stolen Generations) for her personal situation. She was the youngest child in her family, and was two years old when she was removed from her mother. National Film and Sound Archive > Lowitja O'Donoghue ‚Äì The Stolen Generation Retrieved 14 May 2014. After she was removed, she did not see her mother again for 33 years. During that time, her mother did not know where her family had been taken. Honours and awards In 1976, O'Donoghue was the first Aboriginal woman to be inducted into the new Order of Australia founded by the Labor Australian Commonwealth Government. The award was in recognition of her work in the welfare field. O'Donoghue was invested as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1983, and was named Australian of the Year in 1984, for her work to improve the welfare of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. She was invested as a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) on 26 January 1999. O'Donoghue has received honorary doctorates from Murdoch University, University of South Australia, Australian National University, Queensland University of Technology and Flinders University. In 2000 she was awarded an honorary professorial fellow at Flinders University and was a visiting fellow at Flinders University. She is a National Patron at the Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial Centre and was inducted into the Olympic Order in 2000. In 2005 O'Donoghue was invested as a Dame of the Order of St Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II.Catholic News > Pope honours 7 South Australians Retrieved 14 May 2014. Since her inaugural oration at the Don Dunstan Foundation in 2007, the annual Lowitja O'Donoghue Oration has been held annually by the Foundation, with a series of speakers illuminating aspects of Indigenous Australians' past and future in Australian society. In May 2017 O'Donoghue was one of three Indigenous Australians, along with Tom Calma and Galarrwuy Yunupingu, honoured by Australia Post in the 2017 Legends Commemorative Stamp \\"Indigenous leaders\\" series to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum.

It formed part of Allied Command Europe (ACE), headquartered at SHAPE at Casteau, Belgium. The land component of the force, consisting of a brigade-sized formation of about 5,000 personnel, was composed of units from 14 NATO states. HQ AMF (L) was at Sullivan Barracks, Mannheim, 1975-78. ACE Mobile Force (Land) The ACE Mobile Force-Land or AMF(L) was intended as a multinational force that could be quickly despatched to any part of ACE's command area - from North Norway, to Germany, to eastern Turkey - to demonstrate the solidarity of the alliance and its ability to resist all forms of aggression against any member state. During the Cold War the AMF-L did frequent exercises in North Norway and in other areas. The Bundeswehr responded to the request of NATO from December 9, 1960, from January 1961 to provide a paratrooper battalion, a medical company, an airborne telecommunications company, and air transport units. In October 1961 Bundeswehr units, including parts of the 1st Airborne Division (the Parachute Battalion 262) in the AMF in October 1961 in Sardinia during Exercise First Try in part, on the Belgian, British and American soldiers were also involved. In November 1965, the Parachute Battalion 262 took part in the AMF maneuver Eastern Express II on the southeast flank of NATO, which took place in Turkey under the leadership of the AMF commander Major General Michael Fitzalan-Howard (UK). In total, 3,500 soldiers from the US, UK, Belgium, Germany and Italy participated in the maneuvers. In 1967 the maneuver Sunshine Express in Greece, also with German participation. In 1970 at Narvik in northern Norway on the north flank of NATO, the AMF United maneuver Arctic Express with 4000 soldiers. It was first deployed operationally in 1991 during the Gulf War, when part of its air component was dispatched to watch the Turkish borders, in the face of a potential threat to a member's territory. The AMF(L) was one of the NATO formations deployed to Norway during Exercise Strong Resolve 1998. The AMF(L) formed the core of the Albania Force (AFOR), a NATO-led international force responsible for establishing and delivering humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo in Albania during the Kosovo crisis in 1999. It was led by Major General John Reith, Commander AMF(L). The Immediate Reaction Task Force (Land) (IRTF-L) was a novel command and control concept successfully developed and evaluated by the AMF(L) between 1999 and 2001. The IRTF(L) concept allowed the AMF(L), an existing Immediate Reaction Force multinational brigade HQ, to command a divisional sized force with minimal augmentation and no intermediate HQs. The trial concluded in December 2001. The Telegraph wrote that NATO had to disband the ACE Mobile Force, '..after Britain withdrew its contribution to ensure troops were available to join any US attack on Iraq. Britain's contribution to [the force] included key support troops, without which the 6,000-strong force could not operate. With no other NATO member prepared to contribute more soldiers, the alliance had no choice but to disband it.' HQ AMF(L) was disbanded on October 31, 2002 and has since been replaced by the NATO Response Force.NATO Press Release (2002)098 - 12 August 2002  Exercises  Part of the NATO maneuver Strong Resolve (1998) The ACE Mobile Force took part in a large number of exercises.Fallschirmj√§ger ‚Äì Die Geschichte der 1.

A sentence œÉ is independent of a given first-order theory T if T neither proves nor refutes œÉ; that is, it is impossible to prove œÉ from T, and it is also impossible to prove from T that œÉ is false. Sometimes, œÉ is said (synonymously) to be undecidable from T; this is not the same meaning of \\"decidability\\" as in a decision problem. A theory T is independent if each axiom in T is not provable from the remaining axioms in T. A theory for which there is an independent set of axioms is independently axiomatizable. Usage note Some authors say that œÉ is independent of T when T simply cannot prove œÉ, and do not necessarily assert by this that T cannot refute œÉ. These authors will sometimes say \\"œÉ is independent of and consistent with T\\" to indicate that T can neither prove nor refute œÉ. Independence results in set theory Many interesting statements in set theory are independent of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory (ZF). The following statements in set theory are known to be independent of ZF, under the assumption that ZF is consistent: *The axiom of choice *The continuum hypothesis and the generalized continuum hypothesis *The Suslin conjecture The following statements (none of which have been proved false) cannot be proved in ZFC (the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory plus the axiom of choice) to be independent of ZFC, under the added hypothesis that ZFC is consistent. *The existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals *The existence of large cardinals *The non-existence of Kurepa trees The following statements are inconsistent with the axiom of choice, and therefore with ZFC. However they are probably independent of ZF, in a corresponding sense to the above: They cannot be proved in ZF, and few working set theorists expect to find a refutation in ZF. However ZF cannot prove that they are independent of ZF, even with the added hypothesis that ZF is consistent. *The axiom of determinacy *The axiom of real determinacy *AD+  Applications to physical theory  Since 2000, logical independence has become understood as having crucial significance in the foundations of physics.

He led the against the Pergamene regime and found success early on, seizing various cities near the coast of Anatolia, including the island of Samos, and killing the Roman consul Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus. However, the revolt was eventually quelled by the Roman Republic in 129 BC when it dispatched the experienced Marcus Perperna to the region.  Staking his Claim  When the Pergamene king, Attalus III, died in 133 BC, he bequeathed his kingdom to the Romans. Though he stipulated that Pergamum and the rest of the Greek cities were exempt from this bequest, it mattered little to the Romans, with Tiberius Gracchus in particular eager to take advantage of this gift to fund his ambitious land reforms. As a result of the turmoil that stemmed from Gracchus encroaching on the prerogative of the Senate by attempting to use his power as the Tribune to allocate the bequest to the funding of his new laws, the Romans were slow in securing their claim. Aristonicus, who claimed to be the illegitimate son of the earlier Pergamene king, Eumenes II (197‚Äì160 BC), father of Attalus III, took advantage of the uncertainty and laid claim to the throne, taking the dynastic name, Eumenes III.  Revolt  Eumenes‚Äô revolt was met with staunch opposition, coming not only from the Romans but also from the surrounding Greek cities. Indeed, in the earlier stages of the revolt much of the conflict came against the Greek cities of the Anatolian coast. According to Strabo, Eumenes successfully convinced Leucae to revolt and only left the region after being driven out by defeat to the Ephesians in a naval battle off the coast of Cyme. Before being expelled from the area he had taken Samos, Myndus and Colophon in sea raids, and crucially, the Roman consul dispatched to put an end to his revolt, Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus, was killed after an attempt to take back Leucae. Eumenes then sought support in the interior, promising freedom to both slaves and serfs whom he referred to as ‚ÄòHeliopolitae‚Äô. It was the serfs, who comprised most of the workers in the interior, who were more receptive to his message; his ideals failed to take hold in cities, where the slaves were concentrated. However the extent to which he was a social revolutionary or simply a dynastic contender to the throne is uncertain, with desperation rather than a genuine desire at reform perhaps motivating his offer of freedom. Nevertheless, he initially found success in the interior, seizing Thyatira as well as Apollonis. His cause was also furthered by the death of Ariarathes V of Cappadocia, who, along with Mithridates V of Pontus, Nicomedes II of Bithynia, and Pylaemenes of Paphlagonia, opposed the revolt in the hopes of winning the favor of Rome. It was around this time that he was joined by Blossius of Cumae, the Stoic, who had been a supporter of Tiberius Gracchus and promised to found a state called Heliopolis in which all were to be free.  Downfall  Despite these gains, the revolt was dealt a blow in 130 BC by the appointment of Crassus‚Äô successor: Marcus Perperna. The consul had prior experience with putting down slave revolts in Sicily, and the Romans reaped the rewards of this experience as Perperna, according to Justinus, subdued Eumenes in their first encounter. Though the location of this encounter is disputed, it is thought to be Stratoniceia on the Caicus in Lydia. Here, the revolt came to an end, with Eumenes being starved into submission and sent, alive, to Rome. His most prominent ally, Blossius, intimately aware of the wrath Rome would bring down upon him, took his own life. After Eumenes arrived in Rome, he was paraded through the city, then executed by strangulation in the Tullianum prison. Perperna's successor in Asia, Manius Aquillius, subsequently oversaw the organisation of the area, dividing the Pergamene kingdom among Rome, Pontus, and Cappadocia.

The victim's ankles are fastened to one roller and the wrists are chained to the other. As the interrogation progresses, a handle and ratchet mechanism attached to the top roller are used to very gradually retract the chains, slowly increasing the strain on the prisoner's shoulders, hips, knees, and elbows and causing excruciating pain. By means of pulleys and levers this roller could be rotated on its own axis, thus straining the ropes until the sufferer's joints were dislocated and eventually separated. Additionally, if muscle fibres are stretched excessively, they lose their ability to contract, rendering them ineffective. One gruesome aspect of being stretched too far on the rack is the loud popping noises made by snapping cartilage, ligaments or bones. One powerful method for putting pressure upon prisoners was to force them to watch someone else being subjected to the rack. Confining the prisoner on the rack enabled further tortures to be simultaneously applied, typically including burning the flanks with hot torches or candles or using \\"pincers made with specially roughened grips to tear out the nails of the fingers and toes\\"Hirsch, A. E., ed., The Book of Torture and Executions, Toronto: Golden Books, 1944 or sliding thin slivers of red-hot coal between pairs of adjacent toes.Scott, G.

Uses Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana (1768) ‚Äì the approved methods of torture which could be used by the legal authorities to arrive at the truth. =Early use= The rack was first used in antiquity and it is unclear exactly from which civilization it originated, though some of the earliest examples are from Greece. The Greeks may have first used the rack as a means of torturing slaves and non-citizens, and later in special cases, as in 356 BC, when it was applied to gain a confession from Herostratus, who was later executed for burning down the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Arrian's Anabasis of Alexander states that Alexander the Great had the pages who conspired in his assassination, and their mentor, his court historian Callisthenes, tortured on the rack in 328 BC.The Anabasis of Arrian According to Tacitus, the rack was used in a vain attempt to extract the names of the conspirators to assassinate Emperor Nero in the Pisonian conspiracy from the freedwoman Epicharis in 65 A.D. The next day, after refusing to talk, she was being dragged back to the rack on a chair (all of her limbs were dislocated, so she could not stand), but strangled herself on a loop of cord on the back of the chair on the way.The Annals by Tacitus (Section 15.57) The rack was also used on early Christians, such as St. Vincent (304 A.D.), and mentioned by the Church Fathers Tertullian and St. Jerome (420 A.D.).The Letters of St. Jerome, Letter I, to Innocent, ¬∂ 3 =Britain= Its first appearance in England is said to have been due to John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter, the constable of the Tower in 1447, whence it was popularly known as the Duke of Exeter's daughter. The Protestant martyr Anne Askew, Daughter of Sir William Askew, Knight of Lincolnshire was tortured with the rack before her execution in 1546 (age 25). She was well known for studying the Bible and memorizing verses; she remained as an example true to her belief even during her execution. The damage done to her by the cruelty of her captors using the rack required that she be carried on a chair to being burned at the stake. The accusations against her: (1) by the bishop's chancellor that claimed women were not allowed to speak the Scriptures, and (2) by the bishop of Winchester because she would not profess that the sacraments were the literal flesh, blood, and bone of Christ even though the English Reformation started a decade earlier. The Catholic martyr Saint Nicholas Owen, a noted builder of priest holes, died under torture on the rack in the Tower of London in 1606. Guy Fawkes is also thought to have been put to the rack, since a royal warrant authorising his torture survives. The warrant states that the \\"lesser tortures\\" should be applied to him first, but that if he remained recalcitrant he could be racked. In 1615 a clergyman called Edmund Peacham, accused of high treason, was racked. In 1628 the question of its legality was raised by a proposal in the Privy Council to rack John Felton, the assassin of the Duke of Buckingham. The judges resisted this, unanimously declaring its use to be contrary to the laws of England. The previous year Charles I had authorised the Irish Courts to rack a Catholic priest; this seems to have been the last time the rack was used in Ireland. In 1679 Miles Prance, a silversmith who was being questioned about the murder of the respected magistrate Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, was threatened with the rack, although it is unlikely that the threat was a serious one. =Russia= \\"Punishment with a Great Knout\\" In Russia up to the 18th century the rack (–¥—ã–±–∞, dyba) was a gallows-like device for suspending the victims (strappado).

Other punitive positioning devices A relief of the torture of Saint John Sarkander on his gravestone in 1620. The term rack is also used, occasionally, for a number of simpler constructions that merely facilitate corporal punishment, after which it may be named specifically, e.g., caning rack, as in a given jurisdiction it was often the custom to administer any given punishment in a specific position, for which the device (with or without fitting shackling and/or padding) would be chosen or specially made. Several devices similar in principle to the rack have been used through the ages. One of these was the Wooden Horse, a device used to torture prisoners during the Roman Empire by stretching them on top of a tall wooden frame until the shoulders were dislocated followed by a violent drop into a hanging position and beating. In another variant used primarily in ancient times, the victim's feet were affixed to the ground and his/her hands were chained to a wheel. When the wheel was turned, the person was stretched in a manner similar to the rack. The Austrian ladder was basically a more vertically oriented rack. As part of the torture, victims would usually be burned under the arms with candles. See also *Procrustes *Strappado *Breaking on the wheel References Sources *Monestier, M. (1994) Peines de mort.

It co-founded Turkey's largest retailer, Migros T√ºrk, which became independent of Migros Switzerland in 1975.

At first he sold only coffee, rice, sugar, pasta, coconut fat and soap from five lorries that went from one village or hamlet to another. The strategy to cut the intermediate trade and their margins led to the broad resistance of his competitors who goaded the producers to boycott him. As a reaction to this threat, Migros started creating its own line of goods beginning with meat, milk and chocolate. Ford TT of Migros company from 1926 Later he and his drivers expanded their inventory and, in 1926, Gottlieb Duttweiler built his first market, also in Z√ºrich. His second store, in Ticino, presaged the future as it was founded as a cooperative. By 1941, the energetic entrepreneur had built a number of markets but, in that year, he basically gave the business to his customers by transforming everything from his privately owned enterprises into regional cooperatives, headed by the Federation of Migros Cooperatives (German: Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund, French: F√©d√©ration des coop√©ratives Migros, Italian: Federazione delle cooperative Migros). As early as 1935, Duttweiler showed his zest for expansion by founding the Hotelplan travel agency. In 1942, the Migros brand was applied to a weekly magazine, Wir Br√ºckenbauer (now known as Migros MagazinNames of the French editions are Pionnier Migros (1944-1947), Construire (1947-2004) and Migros magazine (since 2004).). Other ventures were restaurants in 1952, gasoline stations (Migrol) in 1954, language schools (Eurocentres) in 1956, the Migros Bank in 1957 and an insurance company in 1959. On behalf of the Migros Genossenschafts-Bund, the Z√ºrich-based Reederei Z√ºrich AG ordered at the H. C. St√ºlcken Sohn shipyard in Hamburg, Germany, the cargo ship Adele which was launched in Hamburg on 15 July 1952; the ship was christened by Adele Duttweiler, the wife of Gottlieb Duttweiler. In 1954, Migros entered the Turkish market, forming Migros T√ºrk in partnership with the Istanbul City Council. This was sold to the Turkish conglomerate Ko√ß Holding in 1975 and is the largest retailer in Turkey. Between 2008 and 2011, Ko√ß Holding sold most of its shares of Migros T√ºrk to BC Partners. Migros opened its first foreign supermarket in the frontier region of France, in Thoiry, in 1993, and its first recreation park, S√§ntispark, at Abtwil in Saint Gallen, in 1986. In 1995, Migros introduced its organic label \\"Migros Bio\\" (which Swiss products follow the Bio Suisse guidelines). In 2017, it added a specific label for organic products containing at least 90% of Swiss ingredients (\\"Migros Bio Suisse\\"). In October 2012, Migros expanded in the German market by acquiring the Hessian food store chain Tegut. In the same year, Migros opened the first Swiss store of German organic supermarket chain Alnatura.Migros begins major offensive in organic market.

More than 90% of the assortment of goods is produced by ninety subsidiaries of Migros. Reflecting the altruism of its founder, Migros operates a number of evening schools for working adults, featuring classes in cooking, languages and other subjects. It has obligated itself to spend one percent of its annual turnover for financing cultural projects in a broad sense; the sub-organisation taking care of this is called Migros KulturprozentOfficial site of Migros Kulturprozent (in German, French, and Italian) (\\"cultural percent\\"). In 2011, an amount of 117 million Swiss francs was paid to finance this purpose.

In 1996, influenced by the budget ranges in supermarket chains in Australia,Produits M-Budget: l'histoire d'un succ√®s , on the Migros website. Retrieved 16 August 2007. Migros made their budget range called M-Budget with seventy products aimed at those with low incomes and large families. Now it has grown to 330 products including mountain bikes, snowboards, mp3 players, milk chocolate, jeans, shoes and lighters. M-Budget products have a standardized packaging color scheme, consisting of a grass green background with the Migros logo in small white text repeated over it. Many of these products are produced in limited quantities rather than as an integral, permanent part of the Migros line. Whether they become permanent depends on their success. This, combined with the considerable brand recognition that Migros enjoys, conveys a certain amount of desirability to the rarer products. As a result, M-Budget items will sometimes be considered collectibles, as it is not always sure that they will ever be produced again. To promote the range, in the early 2000s (decade), Migros developed M-Budget Party with tickets costing 9.90 CHF including free non-alcoholic drinks (cola, lemonade and orange juice) and snacks (crisps, chocolate and cakes). In 2005, together with Swisscom, Migros launched M-Budget Mobile, a pay-as-you-go MVNO mobile virtual network operator. Also in 2005, Migros introduced a premium line called Migros s√©lection, featuring for the most part food products typically associated with higher budgets and prepared in different fashions than is available through general stock. S√©lection products also have their distinctive packaging, with pearl white and gold color schemes. In April 2006, Migros announced the M-Budget credit card, an initiative between the Federation of Migros Cooperatives, GE Money Bank and MasterCard, originally with an annual rate of CHF 4.40, which is low compared to credit card annual rates of CHF 100 for a MigrosBank MasterCard Argent credit card.

Competitors  Migros's main competitor, Coop (Switzerland's second-largest supermarket chain), also has a cooperative structure like Migros, but with a more centralized organization.Article \\"Coop (Schweiz)\\" in German Wikipedia Smaller competitors include the Manor department-store chain, and more recently Aldi. Aldi, a very large supermarket group internationally, opened its first Swiss shops in 2005, and thus operates just a few branches . A further competitor, Lidl, established its first Swiss supermarkets in March 2009. In January 2007 Migros acquired 70 per cent Denner's shares, effectively merging the largest and third-largest food retail chains in Switzerland. According to both companies, the move took place in order for the Denner chain to better compete with increasing foreign competition. Switzerland's largest retailer, Migros, has purchased a majority stake in the country's third largest food chain, Denner. from Swissinfo Criticism Some critics like Sorgim, a Swiss non-profit organization (its name is Migros backwards), claim that Migros has lost touch with its founder's ideals. They say that the cooperative is not governed democratically by its members as it was once envisioned by Gottlieb Duttweiler. It is argued that instead, through various amendments to the by-laws, it is now the executive board that decides over all major business matters and policies.

The site, which has an area of features an 18th-century landscaped garden, some of the largest Cistercian ruins in Europe, a Jacobean mansion and a Victorian church designed by William Burges. It was developed around the ruins of the Cistercian Fountains Abbey.  History  =Fountains Abbey and Hall= Fountains Abbey was founded in 1132 by Benedictine monks who left St Mary's Abbey, York to follow the Cistercian order. After the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539 by Henry VIII, the Abbey buildings and over of land were sold by the Crown to Sir Richard Gresham, a merchant. The property was passed down through several generations of Sir Richard's family, then sold to Stephen Proctor who built Fountains Hall probably between 1598 and 1604. The hall is a Jacobean mansion, built partly with stone from the Abbey ruins. Fountains Abbey mill is the only 12th-century Cistercian cornmill left in the UK and the oldest 'intact' building on the estate. =Studley estate= J.P. Neale, c1820. From 1452 onwards, Studley Royal was inhabited by the Mallory family, most notably by MPs John Mallory and William Mallory. John Aislabie inherited the Studley estate from his elder brother in 1693. He was the Tory Member of Parliament for Ripon in 1695, and in 1718 became Chancellor of the Exchequer. Aislabie was a principal sponsor of the South Sea Company scheme, the bill for which was promoted by him personally. In 1720 when this vast financial operation collapsed, he was expelled from Parliament and disqualified for life from public office. Aislabie returned to Yorkshire and devoted himself to the creation of the garden he had begun in 1718. After his death in 1742, his son William extended his scheme by purchasing the remains of the Abbey and Fountains Hall. He extended the landscaped area in the picturesque romantic style, contrasting with the formality of his father's work. Between them, the two created what is arguably England's most important 18th-century Water Garden. After William's death, the estate passed to his daughter Elizabeth Allanson and then to her niece, Mrs Elizabeth Sophie Lawrence, who lived there from 1808 until her death in 1845. It then devolved to Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey, a distant relative on whose death in 1859 the estate passed to his nephew the Marquess of Ripon, the Viceroy of India, who built St Mary's church in the park. On the death of Frederick Robinson, 2nd Marquess of Ripon in 1923, the estate was acquired by his cousin Clare George Vyner. In 1966 the estate was bought by West Riding County Council and in 1983 was taken over by the National Trust. =Studley Royal House= Studley Royal House in 1880. Studley Royal House (or Hall) stood in the north-west corner of the park. Originally a medieval manor house, having a main block with forward projecting wings, it burned down in 1716 and was rebuilt by John Aislabie. He filled in the centre, to which his son William added a portico in 1762 to complete its Palladian appearance. The building was destroyed by fire in 1946. A large stable block, built between 1728 and 1732, survived and is now a private house ( 54¬∞ 7'30.55\\"N 1¬∞34'34.82\\"W ). =Recent history= In 1966 the estate was purchased by West Riding County Council and was acquired by the National Trust in 1983. The Abbey precinct is managed by English Heritage on behalf of the National Trust. In 1986 the entire Park was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It gained recognition as it fulfills the criteria of ‚Äúbeing a masterpiece of human creative genius, and an outstanding example of a type of building or architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates significant stages in human history‚Äù. Since 1994 the estate has been within the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Major features The park incorporates Fountains Abbey, Fountains Hall, and a number of other notable historic features. =Studley Royal Water Garden= The Lake, from Temple of Piety, Studley Park, Yorkshire. Published 21 June 1866. The water garden at Studley Royal created by John Aislabie in 1718 is one of the best surviving examples of a Georgian water garden in England. It was expanded by his son, William who purchased the adjacent Fountains Estate. The garden's elegant ornamental lakes, canals, temples and cascades provide a succession of dramatic eye-catching vistas. It is also studded with a number of follies including a neo-Gothic castle and a palladian-style banqueting house. =St Mary's Church= View of the West End of the church St Mary's Church was one of two, late Victorian, memorial churches in Yorkshire, built by the family of the First Marquess of Ripon in memory of Frederick Grantham Vyner. The other is the Church of Christ the Consoler at Skelton-on-Ure, and the architect of both was William Burges. Vyner was murdered by Greek bandits in 1870 and his mother, Lady Mary Vyner, and sister, Lady Ripon, used the unspent ransom, gathered to obtain his release, to build two churches in Vyner's memory on their respective Yorkshire estates. Burges' appointment as architect was most likely due to the connection between his greatest patron, John Crichton- Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute and Vyner, who had been friends at Oxford. St Mary's, on Lady Ripon's estate at Studley Royal, was commissioned in 1870 and work began in 1871. The church was consecrated in 1878. As at Skelton, Burges' design demonstrates a move from his favoured Early-French, to an English style. Pevsner writes of \\"a Victorian shrine, a dream of Early English glory.\\" The interior is spectacular, exceeding Skelton in richness and majesty. The stained glass is of particularly high quality. St Mary's is Burges' \\"ecclesiastical masterpiece.\\" =Deer park= The medieval deer park, where the church stands, is home to between 300 ‚Äì 350 deer and a wealth of flora and fauna. At Studley there are three types of deer: Red Deer, Fallow Deer and Sika Deer.

The Orpo organisation was absorbed into the Nazi monopoly on power after regional police jurisdiction was removed in favour of the central Nazi government (\\"Reich-ification\\", Verreichlichung, of the police). The Orpo was controlled, nominally by the Interior Ministry but its executive functions rested with the leadership of the SS until the end of World War II. Owing to their green uniforms, Orpo were also referred to as Gr√ºne Polizei (green police). The force was first established as a centralised organisation uniting the municipal, city, and rural uniformed police that had been organised on a state-by-state basis. The Ordnungspolizei encompassed virtually all of Nazi Germany's law-enforcement and emergency response organisations, including fire brigades, coast guard, and civil defence. In the prewar period, Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, and Kurt Daluege, chief of the Order Police, cooperated in transforming the police force of the Weimar Republic into militarised formations ready to serve the regime's aims of conquest and racial annihilation. Police troops were first formed into battalion-sized formations for the invasion of Poland, where they were deployed for security and policing purposes, also taking part in executions and mass deportations. During World War II, the force had the task of policing the civilian population of the occupied and colonised countries beginning in spring 1940. Orpo's activities escalated to genocide with the invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. Twenty-three Order Police battalions, formed into independent regiments or attached to Wehrmacht security divisions and Einsatzgruppen, perpetrated mass murder in the Holocaust and were responsible for widespread crimes against humanity and genocide targeting the civilian population. History Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, was named Chief of German Police in the Interior Ministry on 17 June 1936 after Hitler announced a decree which was to \\"unify the control of police duties in the Reich\\". Traditionally, law enforcement in Germany had been a state and local matter. In this role, Himmler was nominally subordinate to Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick. However, the decree effectively subordinated the police to the SS. Himmler gained authority as all of Germany's uniformed law enforcement agencies were amalgamated into the new Ordnungspolizei, whose main office became populated by officers of the SS. The police were divided into the Ordnungspolizei (Orpo or regular police) and the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo or security police), which had been established in June 1936. The Orpo assumed duties of regular uniformed law enforcement while the SiPo consisted of the secret state police (Geheime Staatspolizei or Gestapo) and criminal investigation police (Kriminalpolizei or Kripo). The Kriminalpolizei was a corps of professional detectives involved in fighting crime and the task of the Gestapo was combating espionage and political dissent. On 27 September 1939, the SS security service, the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and the SiPo were folded into the Reich Main Security Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt or RSHA). The RSHA symbolised the close connection between the SS (a party organisation) and the police (a state organisation). In broad terms, Himmler pursued the amalgamation of SS and police into a form of \\"State Protection Corps\\" (Staatsschutzkorps), and used the expanded reach the police powers gave him to persecute ideological opponents and \\"undesirables\\" of the Nazi regime such as Jews, freemasons, the churches, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other groups defined as \\"asocial\\". The Nazi conception of criminality was racial and biological, holding that criminal traits were hereditary, and had to be exterminated to purify German blood. As a result, even ordinary criminals were consigned to concentration camps to remove them from the German racial community (Volksgemeinschaft) and ultimately exterminate them. The Order Police played a central role in carrying out the Holocaust. By \\"both career professionals and reservists, in both battalion formations and precinct service\\" (Einzeldienst) through providing men for the tasks involved.Browning, Nazi Policy, p. 143. Organization The German Order Police had grown to 244,500 men by mid-1940. The Orpo was under the overall control of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Himmler as Chief of the German Police in the Ministry of the Interior. It was initially commanded by SS-Oberstgruppenf√ºhrer und Generaloberst der Polizei Kurt Daluege. In May 1943, Daluege had a massive heart attack and was removed from duty. He was replaced by SS- Obergruppenf√ºhrer und General der Waffen-SS und der Polizei Alfred W√ºnnenberg, who served until the end of the war. By 1941, the Orpo had been divided into the following offices covering every aspect of German law enforcement. The central command office known as the Ordnungspolizei Hauptamt was located in Berlin. From 1943 it was considered a full SS-Headquarters command.. The Orpo main office consisted of Command Department (Kommandoamt), responsible for finance, personnel and medical; Administrative (Verwaltung) charged with pay, pensions and permits; Economic (Wirtschaftsverwaltungsamt); Technical Emergency Service (Technische Nothilfe); Fire Brigades Bureau (Feuerwehren); Colonial Police (Kolonialpolizei); and SS and Police Technical Training Academy (Technische SS-und Polizeiakademie). =Branches of police= Ordnungspolizei in Minsk, Reichskommissariat Ostland, Wei√üruthenien, 1943 * Administration (Verwaltungspolizei) was the administrative branch of the Orpo and had overall command authority for all Orpo police stations. The Verwaltungspolizei also was the central office for record keeping and was the command authority for civilian law enforcement groups, which included the Gesundheitspolizei (health police), Gewerbepolizei (commercial or trade police), and the Baupolizei (building police). In the main towns, Verwaltungspolizei, Schutzpolizei and Kriminalpolizei would be organised into a police administration known as the Polizeipr√§sidium or Polizeidirektion, which had authority over these police forces in the urban district. * State protection police (Schutzpolizei des Reiches), state uniformed police in cities and most large towns, which included police-station duties (Revierdienst) and barracked police units for riots and public safety (Kasernierte Polizei). *Municipal protection police (Schutzpolizei der Gemeinden), municipal uniformed police in smaller and some large towns. Although fully integrated into the Ordnungspolizei-system, its police officers were municipal civil servants. The civilian law enforcement in towns with a municipal protection police was not done by the Verwaltungspolizei, but by municipal civil servants. Until 1943 they also had municipal criminal investigation departments, but that year, all such departments with more than 10 detectives, were integrated into the Kripo. *Gendarmerie (state rural police) were tasked with frontier law enforcement to include small communities, rural districts, and mountainous terrain. With the development of a network of motorways or Autobahnen, motorised gendarmerie companies were set up in 1937 to secure the traffic. * Traffic police (Verkehrspolizei) was the traffic-law enforcement agency and road safety administration of Germany. The organisation patrolled Germany's roads (other than motorways which were controlled by Motorized Gendarmerie) and responded to major accidents. The Verkehrspolizei was also the primary escort service for high Nazi leaders who travelled great distances by automobile. * Water police (Wasserschutzpolizei) was the equivalent of the coast guard and river police. Tasked with the safety and security of Germany's rivers, harbours, and inland waterways, the group also had authority over the SS-Hafensicherungstruppen (\\"harbour security troops\\") which were Allgemeine-SS units assigned as port security personnel. * Fire police (Feuerschutzpolizei) consisted of all professional fire departments under a national command structure. =Hilfspolizei= * The Orpo Hauptamt also had authority over the Freiwillige Feuerwehren, the local volunteer civilian fire brigades. At the height of the Second World War, in response to heavy bombing of Germany's cities, the combined Feuerschutzpolizei and Freiwillige Feuerwehren numbered nearly two million members. * Air raid protection police (Luftschutzpolizei) was the civil protection service in charge of air raid defence and rescue victims of bombings in connection with the Technische Nothilfe (Technical Emergency Service) and the Feuerschutzpolizei (professional fire departments). Created as the Security and Assistance Service (Sicherheits und Hilfsdienst) in 1935, it was renamed Luftschutzpolizei in April 1942. The air raid network was supported by the Reichsluftschutzbund (Reich Association for Air Raid Precautions) an organisation controlled from 1935 by the Air Ministry under Hermann G√∂ring. The RLB set up an organisation of air raid wardens who were responsible for the safety of a building or a group of houses. *Technical Emergency Corps (Technische Nothilfe; TeNo) was a corps of engineers, technicians and specialists in construction work. The TeNo was created in 1919 to keep the public utilities and essential industries running during the wave of strikes. From 1937, the TeNo became a technical auxiliary corps of the police and was absorbed into Orpo Hauptamt. By 1943, the TeNo had over 100,000 members. *Volunteer Fire Department (Feuerwehren), volunteer fire departments, conscripted fire departments and industrial fire departments were auxiliary police subordinate to the Ordnungspolizei. * Radio protection (Funkschutz) was made up of SS and Orpo security personnel assigned to protect German broadcasting stations from attack and sabotage. The Funkschutz was also the primary investigating service which detected illegal reception of foreign radio broadcasts. * Urban and rural emergency police (Stadt- und Landwacht) created in 1942 as a part-time police reserve. Abolished in 1945 with the creation of the Volksturm. * Auxiliary Police (Schutzmannschaft) was the collaborationist auxiliary police in occupied Eastern Europe. Sonderpolizei Sonderpolizei was the special police authorities not subordinate to the Hauptamt Ordnungspolizei or the Reichssicherheitshauptamt:Davis, Brian L. (2007). The German Home Front 1939-1945. Oxford, p. 9. * Reichsbahnfahndungsdienst, the \\"Railway criminal investigative service\\", subordinate to the Deutsche Reichsbahn. * Bahnschutzpolizei, subordinate to the Deutsche Reichsbahn. * SS-Bahnschutz replaced the Bahnschutzpolizei within the Reich territory from 1944. * Postal protection (Postschutz) comprised roughly 45,000 members and was tasked with the security of Germany's Reichspost, which was responsible not only for the mail but other communications media such as the telephone and telegraph systems. * SS-Postschutz; created with the transfer of the Postschutz from the Reichministry of Post to the Allgemeine-SS in 1942. * Forstschutzpolizei, under the Reichsforstamt. * Jagdpolizei (Hunting Police), under the Reichsforstamt. It was largely exercised through the Deutsche J√§gerschaft. * Zollpolizei (Customs Police), exercised through the Zollgrenzschutz and the Customs Authorities under the Ministry of Finance. * Flurschutzpolizei (Agricultural Field Police), under the Ministry of Agriculture. * Factory protection police (Werkschutzpolizei) were the security guards of Nazi Germany. Its personnel were civilians employed by industrial enterprises, and typically were issued paramilitary uniforms. They were ultimately subordinated to the Ministry of Aviation. * Deichpolizei (Dam and Dyke Police), subordinated to the Ministry of Economy. Police battalions =Invasion of Poland= Krak√≥w ghetto, 1941. Between 1939 and 1945, the Ordnungspolizei maintained military formations, trained and outfitted by the main police offices within Germany.Goldhagen 1997, p. 204.Browning 1998, p. 38. Specific duties varied widely from unit to unit and from one year to another.Breitman, Richard, Official Secrets, Hill and Wang: NY, 1998, p 5 & Goldhagen, Daniel J., Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust, Random House: USA, 1996, p 186. Generally, the Order Police were not directly involved in frontline combat, except for Ardennes in May 1940, and the Siege of Leningrad in 1941.Browning 1992, p. 5 (22/298 in PDF). The first 17 battalion formations (from 1943 renamed SS-Polizei-Bataillone) were deployed by Orpo in September 1939 along with the Wehrmacht army in the invasion of Poland. The battalions guarded Polish prisoners of war behind the German lines, and carried out expulsion of Poles from Reichsgaue under the banner of Lebensraum.Browning 1992, p. 38. They also committed atrocities against both the Catholic and the Jewish populations as part of those \\"resettlement actions\\".Rossino, Alexander B., Hitler Strikes Poland, University of Kansas Press: Lawrence, Kansas, 2003, pp 69‚Äì72, en passim. After hostilities had ceased, the battalions - such as Reserve Police Battalion 101 - took up the role of security forces, patrolling the perimeters of the Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland (the internal ghetto security issues were managed by the SS, SD, and the Criminal Police, in conjunction with the Jewish ghetto administration).Hillberg, p 81. Each battalion consisted of approximately 500 men armed with light infantry weapons. In the east, each company also had a heavy machine-gun detachment.Browning 1992, p. 45 (72 in PDF). Administratively, the Police Battalions remained under the Chief of Police Kurt Daluege, but operationally they were under the authority of regional SS and Police Leaders (SS- und Polizeif√ºhrer), who reported up a separate chain of command directly to Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler.Hillberg, pp 71‚Äì73. The battalions were used for various auxiliary duties, including the so-called anti-partisan operations, support of combat troops, and construction of defence works (i.e. Atlantic Wall). Some of them were focused on traditional security roles as an occupying force, while others were directly involved in actions designed to inflict terror and in the ensuing Holocaust.Browning 1998, pp. 11-12, 31-32. While they were similar to Waffen-SS, they were not part of the thirty-eight Waffen-SS divisions, and should not be confused with them, including the national 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division. The battalions were originally numbered in series from 1 to 325, but in February 1943 were renamed and renumbered from 1 to about 37, to distinguish them from the Schutzmannschaft auxiliary battalions recruited from local population in German-occupied areas.

United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The Order Police battalions, operating both independently and in conjunction with the Einsatzgruppen, became an integral part of the Final Solution in the two years following the attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Operation Barbarossa. The first mass killing of 3,000 Jews by Police Battalion 309 occurred in occupied Bia≈Çystok on 12 July 1941.Browning 1998, pp. 9-12 (26/298 in PDF). Police battalions were part of the first and second wave of killings in 1941-42 in the territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union and also during the killing operations within the-1939 borders of the USSR, whether as part of Order Police regiments, or as separate units reporting directly to the local SS and Police Leaders.Hillberg, pp. 175, 192‚Äì198, en passim. They included the Reserve Police Battalion 101 from Hamburg, Battalion 133 of the N√ºrnberg Order Police, Police Battalions 45, 309 from Koln, and 316 from Bottrop-Oberhausen. Their murder operations bore the brunt of the Holocaust by bullet on the Eastern Front. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, this latter role was obscured both by the lack of court evidence and by deliberate obfuscation, while most of the focus was on the better-known Einsatzgruppen (\\"Operational groups\\") who reported to the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA) under Reinhard Heydrich.Hillberg, Raul, The Destruction of the European Jews, Holmes & Meir: NY, NY, 1985, pp. 100‚Äì106. Order Police battalions involved in direct killing operations were responsible for at least 1 million deaths.Goldhagen, pp 202, 271‚Äì273, Goldhagen's citations include Israel Gutman, Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, NY: Macmillan 1990 Starting in 1941 the Battalions and local Order Police units helped to transport Jews from the ghettos in both Poland and the USSR (and elsewhere in occupied Europe) to the concentration and extermination camps, as well as operations to hunt down and kill Jews outside the ghettos.Goldhagen, p 195. The Order Police were one of the two primary sources from which the Einsatzgruppen drew personnel in accordance with manpower needs (the other being the Waffen-SS).Hillberg, pp 105‚Äì106. In 1942, the majority of the police battalions were re-consolidated into thirty SS and Police Regiments. These formations were intended for garrison security duty, anti- partisan functions, and to support Waffen-SS units on the Eastern Front. Notably, the regular military police of the Wehrmacht (Feldgendarmerie) were separate from the Ordnungspolizei. Waffen-SS Police Division The primary combat arm of the Ordnungspolizei was the SS Polizei Division the Waffen-SS. The division was formed in October 1939, when thousands of members of the Orpo were drafted and placed together with artillery and signals units transferred from the army. The division consisted of four police regiments composed of Orpo personnel and was typically used to rotate police members into a military situation, so as not to lose police personnel to the general draft of the Wehrmacht or to the full SS divisions of the regular Waffen-SS. Very late in the war several Orpo SS-Police regiments were transferred to the Waffen-SS to form the 35th SS Division.

An SS Propaganda Company photograph of armed Volkssturm; a uniformed Orpo man is shown at the far right end of the line. By the start of the Second World War in 1939, the SS had effectively gained complete operational control over the German Police, although outwardly the SS and Police still functioned as separate entities. The Ordnungspolizei maintained its own system of insignia and Orpo ranks as well as distinctive police uniforms. Under an SS directive known as the \\"Rank Parity Decree\\", policemen were highly encouraged to join the SS and, for those who did so, a special police insignia known as the SS Membership Runes for Order Police was worn on the breast pocket of the police uniform. In 1940, standard practice in the German Police was to grant equivalent SS rank to all police generals. Police generals who were members of the SS were referred to simultaneously by both rank titles - for instance, a Generalleutnant in the Police who was also an SS member would be referred to as SS Gruppenf√ºhrer und Generalleutnant der Polizei. In 1942, SS membership became mandatory for police generals, with SS collar insignia (overlaid on police green backing) worn by all police officers ranked Generalmajor and above. The distinction between the police and the SS had virtually disappeared by 1943 with the creation of the SS and Police Regiments, which were consolidated from earlier police security battalions. SS officers now routinely commanded police troops and police generals serving in command of military troops were granted equivalent SS rank in the Waffen-SS. In August 1944, when Himmler was appointed Chef des Ersatzheeres (Chief of the Home Army), all police generals automatically were granted Waffen-SS rank because they had authority over the prisoner-of-war camps.

It was established by the Constitution of the Fifth Republic on 4 October 1958 to ensure that constitutional principles and rules are upheld. It is housed in the Palais-Royal, Paris. Its main activity is to rule on whether proposed statutes conform with the Constitution, after they have been voted by Parliament and before they are signed into law by the President of the French Republic (a priori review). Since 1 March 2010, individual citizens who are party to a trial or a lawsuit have been able to ask for the Council to review whether the law applied in the case is constitutional ( review). In 1971, the Council ruled that conformity with the Constitution also entails conformity with two other texts referred to in the preamble of the Constitution, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the preamble of the constitution of the Fourth Republic, both of which list constitutional rights.Preamble of the Constitution of the Fourth Republic, Wikisource.Constitution of the Fourth French Republic, Wikisource. Members are often referred to as les sages (\\"the sages\\") in the media and the general public, as well as in the Council's own documents.https://www.france24.com/en/20100708-anti-veil-law-risks-being-shot- down-france-constitutional-council-burqa-ump-party- governmenthttps://www.conseil- constitutionnel.fr/sites/default/files/2019-10/2019rapdf_bd_en.pdf Legal theorist Arthur Dyevre notes that this \\"tends to make those who dare criticise them look unwise.\\" Powers and tasks =Overview= The Council has two main areas of power: # The first is the supervision of elections, both presidential and parliamentary, and ensuring the legitimacy of referendums (Articles 58, 59 and 60). They issue the official results, ensure proper conduct and fairness, and see that campaign spending limits are adhered to. The Council is the supreme authority in these matters. The Council can declare an election to be invalid if improperly conducted, the winning candidate used illegal methods, or the winning candidate spent more than the legal limits for the campaign. # The second area of Council power is the interpretation of the fundamental meanings of the constitution, procedure, legislation, and treaties. The Council can declare dispositions of laws to be contrary to the Constitution of France or to the principles of constitutional value that it has deduced from the Constitution or from the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. It also may declare laws to be in contravention of treaties that France has signed, such as the European Convention on Human Rights. Their declaring that a law is contrary to constitutional or treaty principles renders it invalid. The Council also may impose reservations as to the interpretation of certain provisions in statutes. The decisions of the Council are binding on all authorities. In some cases, examination of laws by the Council is compulsory. Organic bills, those which fundamentally affect government and treaties, need to be assessed by the Council before they are considered ratified (Article 61-1 and 54). Amendments concerning the rules governing parliamentary procedures need to be considered by the Council as well. Guidance may be sought from the Council in regard to whether reform should come under statute law (voted by Parliament) or whether issues are considered as (regulation) to be adopted with decree of the Prime Minister. The re-definition of legislative dispositions as regulatory matters initially constituted a significant share of the (then light) caseload of the Council. In the case of other statutes, seeking the oversight of the Council is not compulsory. However, the President of the Republic, the President of the Senate, the President of the Assembly, the Prime Minister of France, 60 members of the National Assembly, or 60 SenatorsNote that this is not 60 members of Parliament: all members on the referral petition must be from the same house of Parliament, though of course members from both houses can submit petitions at the same time and with the same arguments. can submit a statute for examination by the Council before its signing into law by the President. In general, it is the parliamentary opposition that brings laws that it deems to infringe civil rights before the Council.Tony Prosser, Constitutions and Political Economy: The Privatisation of Public Enterprises in France and Great Britain, The Modern Law Review, Vol. 53, No. 3 (May 1990), pp. 304‚Äì320; see p. 307 \\"The number of references has steadily grown; it is no exaggeration to claim that any important controversial legislation is now likely to be referred.\\" Another task, of lesser importance in terms of number of referrals, is the reclassification of statute law into the domain of regulations on the Prime Minister's request. This happens when the Prime Minister and his government wish to alter law that has been enacted as statute law, but should instead belong to regulations according to the Constitution. The Prime Minister has to obtain reclassification from the Council prior to taking any decree changing the regulations. This, however, is nowadays only a small fraction of the Council's activity: in 2008, out 140 of decisions, only 5 concerned reclassifications.Constitutional Council, Index of 2008 decisions =Enactment of legislation= :This article refers extensively to individual articles in the Constitution of France. The reader should refer to the official translation of the Constitution on the site of the French National Assembly. Another recommended reading is the Constitutional Council overview on the Council web site. The 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The Government of France consists of an executive branch (President of the Republic, Prime Minister, ministers and their services and affiliated organisations); a legislative branch (both houses of Parliament); and a judicial branch. The judicial branch does not constitute a single hierarchy: * Administrative courts fall under the Council of State, * Civil and criminal courts under the Court of Cassation, * Some entities also have advisory functions. For historical reasons, there has long been political hostility in the nation to the concept of a \\"Supreme Court\\"‚Äîthat is, a powerful court able to quash legislation, because of the experience of citizens in the pre- Revolutionary era.James Beardsley, \\"Constitutional Review in France\\", The Supreme Court Review, Vol. 1975, (1975), pp. 189‚Äì259Michael H. Davis, The Law/Politics Distinction, the French Conseil Constitutionnel, and the U. S.

Bermann, The Constitution and the Courts in France, The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 27, No. 4 (Autumn, 1979), pp. 567‚Äì587 Whether the Constitutional Council is a court is a subject of academic discussion,Fran√ßois Luchaire, \\"Le Conseil constitutionnel est-il une juridiction ?\\", Revue du droit public et de la science politique en France et √† l'√©tranger (RDP), janvier-juin 1979 (volume 1), pp. 27‚Äì52 but some scholars consider it effectively the supreme court of France.Marcel Waline, The Constitutional Council of the French Republic, The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 12, No. 4 (Autumn, 1963), pp. 483‚Äì493 lists reasons for the Council to be considered as a court: \\"If it be admitted that a judicial authority is characterized by the effect of res judicata attaching to its decisions, it must necessarily be concluded that the Constitutional Council is a court, and even the supreme court of the State.\\" The Constitution of the French Fifth Republic distinguishes two kinds of legislation: statute law, which is normally voted upon by Parliament (except for ordonnances), and government regulations, which are enacted by the Prime Minister and his government as decrees and other regulations (arr√™t√©s). Article 34 of the Constitution exhaustively lists the areas reserved for statute law: these include, for instance, criminal law. Any regulation issued by the executive in the areas constitutionally reserved for statute law is unconstitutional unless it has been authorized by a statute as secondary legislation. Any citizen with an interest in the case can obtain the cancellation of these regulations by the Council of State, on grounds that the executive has exceeded its authority. Furthermore, the Council of State can quash regulations on grounds that they violate existing statute law, constitutional rights, or the \\"general principles of law\\".Lionel Neville Brown, John Bell, Jean-Michel Galabert, French administrative law, 5 ed., 1998, Clarendon Press, ; see p. 220 for the general principles of Law. In addition, new acts can be referred to the Constitutional Council by a petition just prior to being signed into law by the President of the Republic. The most common circumstance for this is that 60 opposition members of the National Assembly, or 60 opposition members of the Senate request such a review. If the Prime Minister thinks that some clauses of existing statute law instead belong to the domain of regulations, he can ask the Council to reclassify these clauses as regulations.Article 37 of the Constitution: \\"Provisions of statutory origin enacted in such matters may be amended by decree issued after consultation with the Council of State. Any such provisions passed after the coming into force of the Constitution shall be amended by decree only if the Constitutional Council has found that they are matters for regulation as defined in the foregoing paragraph.\\"An example of such reclassification is decision 2008-210 L of 7 May 2008, with scholarly commentary in Commentaire de la d√©cision n¬∞ 2008-210 L du 7 mai 2008 ‚Äì Nature juridique de dispositions du code de la route (\\"Comments on decision 2008-210 L of 7 May 2008 ‚Äì Juridical nature of provisions in the Road code\\") in Les Cahiers du Conseil constitutionnel, Cahier n¬∞ 25 (\\"The Constitutional Council's notebooks\\"): the name of the administration with which certain administrative procedures should be filed is not the domain of statute law, but of regulation. Traditionally, France refused to accept the idea that courts could quash legislation enacted by Parliament (though administrative courts could quash regulations produced by the executive). This reluctance was based in the French revolutionary era: pre-revolutionary courts had often used their power to refuse to register laws and thus prevent their application for political purposes, and had blocked reforms. French courts were prohibited from making rulings of a general nature. Also, politicians believed that, if courts could quash legislation after it had been enacted and taken into account by citizens, there would be too much legal uncertainty: how could a citizen plan his or her actions according to what is legal or not if laws could a posteriori be found not to hold? Yet, in the late 20th century, courts, especially administrative courts, began applying international treaties, including law of the European Union, as superior to national law. A 2009 reform, effective on 1 March 2010, enables parties to a lawsuit or trial to question the constitutionality of the law that is being applied to them. The procedure, known as , is broadly as follows: the question is raised before the trial judge and, if it has merit, is forwarded to the appropriate supreme court (Council of State if the referral comes from an administrative court, Court of Cassation for other courts). The supreme court collects such referrals and submits them to the Constitutional Council. If the Constitutional Council rules a law to be unconstitutional, this law is struck down from the law books. The decision applies to everyone and not only to the cases at hand. History and evolution Logotype of the Constitutional Council of France Meeting room While since the 19th century the judicial review that the Constitutional Council brings to bear on the acts of the executive branch has played an increasingly large role, the politicians who have framed the successive French institutions have long been reluctant to have the judiciary review legislation. The argument was that un-elected judges should not be able to overrule directly the decisions of the democratically elected legislature. This may also have reflected the poor impression resulting from the political action of the parlements ‚Äì courts of justice under the ancien r√©gime monarchy: these courts often had chosen to block legislation in order to further the privileges of a small caste in the nation. The idea was that legislation was a political tool, and that the responsibility of legislation should be borne by the legislative body. Originally, the Council was meant to have rather technical responsibilities: ensuring that national elections were fair, arbitrating the division between statute law (from the legislative) and regulation (from the executive), etc. The Council role of safekeeping fundamental rights was probably not originally intended by the drafters of the Constitution of the French Fifth Republic: they believed that Parliament should be able to ensure that it did not infringe on such rights. However, the Council's activity has considerably extended since the 1970s, when questions of justice for larger groups of people became pressing.Pascal Jan, Le Conseil constitutionnel, Pouvoirs n¬∞ 99 2001/4, pp. 71‚Äì86, Le Seuil, . From 1958 to 1970, under Charles de Gaulle's presidency, the Constitutional Council was sometimes described as a \\"cannon aimed at Parliament\\", protecting the executive branch against encroachment by statute law voted by Parliament. All but one referral to the Constitutional Council came from the Prime Minister, against acts of Parliament, and the Council agreed to partial annulments in all cases. The only remaining referral came from the President of the Senate, Gaston Monnerville, against the 1962 referendum on direct election of the President of the Republic, which Charles de Gaulle supported. The Council ruled that it was \\"incompetent\\" to cancel the direct expression of the will of the French people.Alec Stone, The Birth of Judicial Politics in France: The Constitutional Council in Comparative Perspective, Oxford University Press, , chapter III In 1971, however, the Council ruled unconstitutional (Decision 71-44DC) some provisions of a law changing the rules for the incorporation of private nonprofit associations, because they infringed on freedom of association, one of the principles of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen; they used the fact that the preamble of the French constitution briefly referred to those principles to justify their decision. For the first time, a statute was declared unconstitutional not because it infringed on technical legal principles, but because it was deemed to infringe on personal freedoms of citizens.J√©r√¥me Favre, La d√©cision du Conseil constitutionnel du 16 juillet 1971. L'invention d'un nouveau pouvoir juridictionnel., Revue d'√©tude politique des assistants parlementaires, nr 2M. Letourneur, R. Drago, The Rule of Law as Understood in France, The American Journal of Comparative Law, Vol. 7, No. 2 (Spring, 1958), pp. 147‚Äì177 In 1974, authority to request a constitutional review was extended to 60 members of the National Assembly or 60 senators.Loi n¬∞74-904 du 29 octobre 1974 portant r√©vision de l'article 61 de la Constitution Soon, the political opposition seized that opportunity to request the review of all controversial acts. The Council increasingly has discouraged \\"riders\\" (cavaliers) ‚Äì amendments or clauses introduced into bills that have no relationship to the original topic of the bill; for instance, \\"budgetary riders\\" in the Budget bill, or \\"social riders\\" in the Social security budget bill. See legislative riders in France.Constitutional Council, √âtat de la jurisprudence du Conseil constitutionnel sur le droit d'amendement (\\"State of the Constitutional Council case law on the right of amendment\\")Les Cahiers du Conseil constitutionnel, Cahier n¬∞ 22, Commentaire de la d√©cision n¬∞ 2006-544 DC du 14 d√©cembre 2006 In January 2005, Pierre Mazeaud, then President of the Constitutional Council, announced that the Council would take a stricter view of language of a non-prescriptive character introduced in laws,V√©ronique Champeil-Desplats, N'est pas normatif qui peut. L'exigence de normativit√© dans la jurisprudence du Conseil constitutionnel. (\\"Anything that can be normative is not. The exigence of normativity in the case law of the Constitutional Council\\"), in Les Cahiers du Conseil Constitutionnel, nr 21, 2006 sometimes known as \\"legislative neutrons\\".The phrase neutron l√©gislatif (\\"legislative neutron\\") was coined by Jean Foyer to designate provisions in statute law that have \\"null juridical charge\\" and thus are neutral with respect to the state of law. This phrase uses imagery from particle physics ‚Äì a neutron has null electrical charge.Proceedings of the National Assembly, 21 June 1982, third sitting, Jean Foyer: \\"Cette semaine, le ministre d'√âtat, ministre de la recherche et de la technologie, nous pr√©sente un projet dont je dirai, ne parlant pas latin pour une fois, mais empruntant ma terminologie √† la langue des physiciens, qu'il est pour l'essentiel un assemblage de neutrons l√©gislatifs, je veux dire de textes dont la charge juridique est nulle.\\" ‚Äì \\"This week, the minister of State, minister for research and technology [Jean- Pierre Chev√®nement] presents us a bill of which I'll say, without talking in latin for once, but instead borrowing my words from the physicists, that it is mostly an assembly of legislative neutrons, I mean of texts with a null juridical charge.\\" Instead of prescribing or prohibiting, as advocated by Portalis,Jean-√âtienne-Marie Portalis, Discours pr√©liminaire du premier projet de Code civil (\\"Preliminary speech for the first project for a Civil code\\"): \\"[La loi] permet ou elle d√©fend ; elle ordonne, elle √©tablit, elle corrige, elle punit ou elle r√©compense.\\" (\\"[Law] permits, or defends; it orders, it establishes, it corrects, it punishes or it rewards.\\") such language makes statements about the state of the world, or wishes about what it should be. Previously, such language was considered devoid of juridical effects and thus harmless; but Mazeaud contended that introducing vague language devoid of juridical consequences dilutes law unnecessarily. He denounced the use of law as an instrument of political communication, expressing vague wishes rather than effective legislation. Mazeaud also said that, because of the constitutional objective that law should be accessible and understandable, law should be precise and clear, and devoid of details or equivocal formulas.MM. Mazeaud et Debr√© d√©noncent les \\"lois d'affichage\\" (\\"Mr Mazeaud and Mr Debr√© denounce posturing laws\\"), Le Monde, 4 January 2005 The practice of the Parliament putting into laws remarks or wishes with no clear legal consequences has been a long-standing concern of French jurists.Report to the National Assembly on the constitutional law of 23 July 2008 by Jean-Luc Warsmann; see the section Les limites de la \\"r√©volution juridique\\" : la pratique de l'article 41 (\\"the limits of the juridical revolution: the practice of article 41\\"), and a list of items that Warsmann contends should never have been in statute law, such as the definition of foie gras and a number of constatations such as \\"Les activit√©s physiques et sportives constituent un facteur important d'√©quilibre\\" (\\"sports are an important factor of personal equilibrium\\"). , one law out of two, including the budget, was sent to the Council at the request of the opposition. In January 2005, Pierre Mazeaud, then president of the Council, publicly deplored the inflation of the number of constitutional review requests motivated by political concerns, without much legal argumentation to back them on constitutional grounds. The French constitutional law of 23 July 2008 amended article 61 of the Constitution. It now allows for courts to submit questions of unconstitutionality of laws to the Constitutional Council. The Court of Cassation (supreme court over civil and criminal courts) and the Council of State (supreme court over administrative courts) each filter the requests coming from the courts under them. Lois organiques, and other decisions organizing how this system functions, were subsequently adopted. The revised system was activated on 1 March 2010.Constitutional council, Comment saisir le Conseil constitutionnel ? \\"(How to file a request before the Constitutional Council?)\\" On 29 December 2012, the council said it was overturning an upper income tax rate of 75% due to be introduced in 2013. Controversies In 1995, Roland Dumas was appointed president of the Council by Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Dumas twice attracted major controversy. First, he was reported as party to scandals regarding the Elf Aquitaine oil company, with many details regarding his mistress, Christine Deviers-Joncour, and his expensive tastes in clothing being published in the press.John Tagliabue, \\"At a French Trial, a Tale Unfolds of Graft on High\\", The New York Times, 18 April 2003 In this period, the Council issued some highly controversial opinions in a decision related to the International Criminal Court, in Decision 98‚Äì408 DC, declaring that the sitting President of the Republic could be tried criminally only by the High Court of Justice, a special court organized by Parliament and originally meant for cases of high treason. This, in essence, ensured that Jacques Chirac would not face criminal charges until he left office. This controversial decision is now moot, since the Parliament redefined the rules of responsibility of the President of the Republic by the French constitutional law of 23 July 2008.Responsabilit√© p√©nale du chef de l'Etat ? (\\"The criminal responsibility of the head of state?\\"), Affaires Publiques In 1999, because of the Elf scandal, Dumas took official leave from the Council and Yves Gu√©na assumed the interim presidency.Les nouveaux rebondissements de l'affaire Elf ‚Äì Au revoir Dumas, bonjour Sirven (\\"Breaking news about the Elf case ‚Äì Goodbye Dumas, welcome Sirven\\"), Le Nouvel Observateur, N¬∞1843 In 2005, the Council again attracted some controversy when Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing and Simone Veil campaigned for the proposed European Constitution, which was submitted to the French voters in a referendum. Simone Veil had participated in the campaign after obtaining a leave of absence from the Council. This action was criticized by some, including Jean-Louis Debr√©, president of the National Assembly, who thought that prohibitions against appointed members of the council conducting partisan politics should not be evaded by their taking leave for the duration of a campaign. Veil defended herself by pointing to precedent; she said, \\"How is that his [Debr√©'s] business? He has no lesson to teach me.\\"R√©f√©rendum : Simone Veil r√©pond √† Debr√© (Referendum: Simone Veil responds to Debr√©), LCI, 6 May 2005. See e.g. \\"Il n'a pas de le√ßon √† me donner.

(\\"Before assuming their duties, the appointed members of the Constitutional council are sworn in before the President of the Republic.\\") The President of the Constitutional Council is selected by the President of the Republic for a term of nine years. If the position becomes vacant, the oldest member becomes interim president. Following the 2008 constitutional revision, appointments to the Council are subject to a parliamentary approval process (Constitution of France, articles 13 and 56). , these provisions are not operational yet since the relevant procedures have not yet been set in law. A quorum of seven members is imposed unless exceptional circumstances are noted.Ordonnance n¬∞58-1067 du 7 novembre 1958, article 14 Votes are by majority of the members present at the meeting; the president of the Council has a casting vote in case of an equal split.Constitution, article 56: Le pr√©sident est nomm√© par le Pr√©sident de la R√©publique. Il a voix pr√©pond√©rante en cas de partage.

Former officeholders have the option to sit if they choose to do so. The members of the Constitutional Council should abstain from partisanship. They should refrain from making declarations that could lead them to be suspected of partisanship. The possibility for former presidents to sit in the Council is a topic of moderate controversy; some see it as incompatible with the absence of partisanship. Ren√© Coty, Vincent Auriol, Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy are the only former Presidents of France to have sat in the Constitutional Council.Entr√©e des ex-pr√©sidents au Conseil constitutionnel : la fin d‚Äôune \\"absurdit√©\\"France24, 2013-01-08 =List of Presidents of the Constitutional Council= The following persons have served as President of the Constitutional Council: * L√©on No√´l, 5 March 1959 to 5 March 1965 * Gaston Palewski, 5 March 1965 to 5 March 1974 * Roger Frey, 5 March 1974 to 4 March 1983 * Daniel Mayer, 4 March 1983 to 4 March 1986 * Robert Badinter, 4 March 1986 to 4 March 1995 * Roland Dumas, 8 March 1995 to 1 March 2000 * Yves Gu√©na, 1 March 2000 to 9 March 2004 * Pierre Mazeaud, 9 March 2004 to 3 March 2007 * Jean-Louis Debr√©, 5 March 2007 to 4 March 2016 * Laurent Fabius, since 8 March 2016 Location Palais Royal entrance to the Constitutional Council from Rue de Montpensier The Council sits in the Palais-Royal (which also houses the Ministry of Culture) in Paris near the Council of State.See description of the Council's offices on the Council's site See also * Constitutional economics * Constitutionalism * in modern law the Cour d'assises exists only in the French judiciary and other civil law jurisdictions, i.e. ** Corte d'Assise Italian Cour d'assises ** Belgian Cour d'assises * it may also refer to obsolete courts in a number of common law jurisdictions, for example: ** Assizes ** Assizes (Ireland) * or royal writs, for example: ** Assize of Clarendon ** Assize of Northampton * Cour de cassation, highest judicial court in France * Court of cassation, general discussion, mostly dealing with common law jurisdictions * Court of Appeal (France)‚ÄîCourt of Appeal in France.

Class A drug, supply, distribution or production premises closure orders Until October 2014, Part I of the Act (\\"Premises where drugs used unlawfully\\") enabled the police to close residential premises concerned in the use, production or supply of Class A drugs and which were associated with serious nuisance or disorder to members of the public in the preceding three months.Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003, s.2(3)(b)Cumbria Constabulary v Wright (2006) EWHC 3574 (Admin); [2007] 1 WLR 1407 After such a notice had been served, within 48 hours a magistrates' court had to consider the application, and could make a closure order under Section 2, known as a \\"Class A drug, supply, distribution or production premises closure Order\\". The effect of such an order was that no-one could lawfully enter the premises whilst the order was in place, and it became a criminal offence to do so. Antisocial behaviour closure orders Between December 2008Inserted by Section 118 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 and October 2014, Part 1A of the Act (\\"Premises associated with persistent disorder or nuisance\\") created the Part 1A closure order or antisocial behaviour closure order. Sections 11A-11L of the 2003 Act permitted the police or local authority to apply to magistrates to close premises where they were satisfied that within the preceding three monthsAnti-Social Behaviour Act 2003, s.11(b)(5) the premises had been associated with \\"significant and persistent disorder or persistent serious nuisance to members of the public.\\"Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003, s.11A(1)(b) The order could be made in respect of business or residential premises. Similar to the Part 1 Order (Crack house closure order), it became an offence to remain in or re-enter the premises for the duration of the order.Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003, s.11D Parts 1 and 1A were repealed on 20 October 2014 by Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 Sch.11(1) para 41(a). Antisocial behaviour injunctions (ASBIs) Part II (\\"Housing\\") amended housing legislation to require social housing organisations to adopt and publish policies on anti- social behaviour. It also strengthened the power of registered social landlords (RSLs) to take action against tenants who cause nuisance or annoyance to neighbours. One power was that secure tenancies could be 'demoted' by order of the County Court, which in theory at least, made eviction easier. A further important provision provided a mechanism for RSLs to apply for injunctions against people causing nuisance and annoyance to people in the neighbourhood of their housing stock. Section 13 of the 2003 Act amended Part V of the Housing Act 1996 ('Conduct of Tenants'), by repealing Sections 152 and 153, and inserting new Sections 153A - 153E. Where a person was invited into residential premises by the occupier, in breach of an s.153A injunction, they committed an offence.Lee v Accent Foundation Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 665; [2008] HLR 3 Section 153A of the Housing Act 1996 was repealed in March 2015.Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 Sch.11(1) para 22 Parenting orders Part III (\\"Parental responsibilities\\") amends 'parenting orders', which were introduced by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. These are intended to specify steps parents must take to control their children. It also introduces 'parenting contracts', which are mainly intended to cover child truancy. Dispersal zones Between January 2004 and October 2014, Part IV (\\"Dispersal of groups etc.\\") gave the police powers to disperse groups of two or more persons in any public place if their presence \\"has resulted, or is likely to result, in any members of the public being intimidated, harassed, alarmed or distressed\\". There was also a power for a police officer (or PCSO) to accompany any unaccompanied person of under 16 to their home between the hours of 9 pm and 6 am. Section 30 did not apply to lawful pickets, although the human rights implications had been considered by the courts on a number of occasions.Sierny v DPP [2006] EWHC 716 (Admin); (2006) 170 JP 697 The power for police to remove a child under s30 was permissive, not coercive.R (ex parte W) v Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis [2006] EWCA Civ 458; [2006] 3 All ER 458 Part IV was repealed in October 2014 by Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 Sch.11(1) para 41(c). Firearms Part V (\\"Firearms\\") amends the Firearms Act 1968 to make possession of an airgun or an imitation weapon in public an offence. The sale of imitation firearms was further limited by section 36 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 (VCRA) which made sale of realistic imitation firearms (RIF's) an offence. Various groups of people who legitimately use RIF's, for work or pleasure, can provide a seller with a defence against prosecution as provided for in section 37 of the VCRA. These groups are set out in regulations made by the Secretary of State, and can be changed at any time. The environment Part VI (\\"The Environment\\") contains a selection of miscellaneous provisions. It gives councils power to serve a closure order on premises causing public nuisance by noise. Councils also now have the power to serve a graffiti removal notice on the person in control (usually the owner) of any surface that is street furniture (street furniture is, usually a telephone box, letterbox, bus stop) where graffiti has been applied, this legislation does not apply to private property. There is a right of appeal to the magistrates court over such a notice, and one ground for appeal is that 'the defacement is neither detrimental to the amenity of the area nor offensive'. It makes the sale of aerosol paint to any person under 16 illegal. Raves and travellers Part VII (\\"Public Order and Trespass\\") amends the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 in two main ways. First, the definition of a 'rave' is amended so that only 20 people, rather than 100 must be present. Second the powers of police to move unauthorised travellers' sites are strengthened. This Part also amends the provisions of the Public Order Act 1986 concerning public assemblies. The earlier Act gave the police power to intervene if a public assembly of 20 or more people appeared likely to cause 'serious public disorder, serious damage to property or serious disruption to the life of the community'. This Act reduces the number to two. High hedges Part VIII (\\"High Hedges\\") is in response to concerns about hedges, typically of Leyland Cypress plants, which can grow to 6 metres or more in height, sometimes cutting out light for neighbours. Such hedges are not controlled by town planning legislation (which normally limits the height of fences to 2 metres), and so there was formerly no way of preventing people from allowing such a hedge to grow. This part of the Act gives local authorities the power to investigate complaints made by people affected by such hedges, and, if necessary, to require their reduction. Councils can charge a fee for dealing with such complaints. Soon after implementation, some councils were charging no fee, while the highest in the country was Sevenoaks, which charged ¬£650. Miscellaneous Designated Public Place, Camden, London Part IX (\\"Miscellaneous\\") makes some changes to the mechanisms for serving and enforcing anti-social behaviour orders. Section 89 extended the powers of Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs). The key changes are that PCSOs have the power to stop a cyclist, and accredited support officers or rail community officers can issue FPNs in respect of a number of offences:Police Reform Act 2002 Schedule 5, Para 1(2)(aa)The Local Authorities (Alcohol Consumption In Designated Public Places) Regulations 2007 * Use of insulting or abusive behaviour to cause harassment alarm or distress * Throwing fireworks in a thoroughfare * Trespassing on a railway * Throwing stones etc. at trains or other things on railways * Buying or attempting to buy alcohol for consumption in a bar in licensed premises by a person under 18 * Knowingly giving a false alarm to the fire brigade * Wasting police time or giving a false reportCriminal Law Act 1967, s.5(2) * Consumption of alcohol in a designated public placeCriminal Justice and Police Act 2001, s.13 * Using a public communications system for sending messages known to be false in order to cause annoyance.

James Cowles Prichard, FRS (11 February 1786 ‚Äì 23 December 1848) was a British physician and ethnologist with broad interests in physical anthropology and psychiatry. His influential Researches into the Physical History of Mankind touched upon the subject of evolution. From 1845, Prichard served as a Medical Commissioner in Lunacy. He also introduced the term \\"senile dementia\\".Prichard J. C. 1835. Treatise on Insanity. London. p. 92  Life  Prichard was born in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. His parents Thomas and Mary Prichard were Quakers: his mother was Welsh, and his father of a family who had emigrated to Pennsylvania. Within a few years of his birth in Ross, Prichard's parents moved to Bristol, where his father now worked in the Quaker ironworks of Harford, Partridge and Cowles. Upon his father's retirement in 1800 he returned to Ross. As a child Prichard was educated mainly at home by tutors and his father, in a range of subjects, including modern languages and general literature.Stocking 1973. Rejecting his father's wish that he should join the ironworks, Prichard decided upon a medical career. Here he faced the difficulty that as a Quaker he could not become a member of the Royal College of Physicians. Therefore, he started on apprenticeships that led to the ranks of apothecaries and surgeons, first studying under the Quaker obstetrician Dr Thomas Pole of Bristol. Apprenticeships followed to other Quaker physicians, and to St Thomas' Hospital in London. In 1805, he entered medical school at Edinburgh University, where his religious affiliation was no bar. Also, the Scottish medical schools were held in esteem, having contributed greatly to the Enlightenment of the previous century. He took his M.D. at Edinburgh, his doctoral thesis of 1808 being his first attempt at the great question of his life: the origin of human varieties and races.Prichard, J. C. 1808. De generis humani varietate. Edinburgh: Abernethy & Walker. Later, he read for a year at Trinity College, Cambridge, after which came a significant personal event: he left the Society of Friends to join the established Church of England. He next moved to St John's College, Oxford, afterwards entering as a gentleman commoner at Trinity College, Oxford, but taking no degree in either university. In 1810 Prichard settled at Bristol as a physician, eventually attaining an established position at the Bristol Infirmary (BRI) in 1816. Whilst working at the BRI, Prichard lived in the Red Lodge. This was also where he wrote Researches into the Physical History of Man.Roslyn HE, Antient Society of St Stephen's Ringers, 1928, p.134 In 1845 he was made one of the three medical Commissioners in Lunacy, having previously been one of the Metropolitan Commissioners, and moved to London. He died there three years later of rheumatic fever. At the time of his death he was president of the Ethnological Society and a Fellow of the Royal Society.Prichard was elected FRS in 1826 or 1827: Royal Society records give both dates.  Work  In 1813 he published his Researches into the Physical History of Man, in two volumes, on essentially the same themes as his dissertation in 1808. The book grew until the third edition of 1836-1847 occupied five volumes. The second to the fourth editions were published under the title Researches into the Physical History of Mankind. The fourth edition was also in five volumes.1st ed.: London: Printed for John and Arthur Arch, Cornhill; and B. and H. Barry, Bristol, 1813. 2nd ed.: 2 vols.

The central conclusion of the work is the unity of the human species, which has been acted upon by causes which have since divided it into permanent varieties or races. The work is dedicated to Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, whose five races of man are adopted. Prichard differed from Blumenbach and other predecessors by the principle that people should be studied by combining all available characters. = Evolution = Three British men, all medically qualified and publishing between 1813 and 1819, William Lawrence, William Charles Wells and Prichard, addressed issues relevant to human evolution. All tackled the question of variation and race in humans; all agreed that these differences were heritable, but only Wells approached the idea of natural selection as a cause. Science historian Conway Zirkle has described Prichard as an evolutionary thinker who came very close \\"to explaining the origin of new forms through the operation of natural selection although he never actually stated the proposition in so many words.\\" Prichard indicated Africa (indirectly) as the place of human origin, in this summary passage: :\\"On the whole there are many reasons which lead us to the conclusion that the primitive stock of men were probably Negroes, and I know of no argument to be set on the other side.\\"Prichard, J. C. 1851. Researches into the Physical History of Mankind. London: Houlston and Stoneman, and J. and A.

A Medical Bibliography (Garrison & Morton): an annotated checklist of texts illustrating the history of medicine. London: Deutsch. entry #159 = Anthropology = Prichard was influential in the early days of ethnology and anthropology. He stated that the Celtic languages are allied by language with the Slavonian, German and Pelasgian (Greek and Latin), thus forming a fourth European branch of Indo-European languages. His treatise containing Celtic compared with Sanskrit words appeared in 1831 under the title Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations. An essay by Adolphe Pictet, which made its author's reputation, was published independently of the earlier investigations of Prichard.Pictet, Adolphe. 1837. De l'affinit√© des langues celtiques avec le sanscrit. Paris: Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise. In 1843 Prichard published his Natural History of Man, in which he reiterated his belief in the specific unity of man, pointing out that the same inward and mental nature can be recognized in all the races.Prichard, J. C. 1843. The Natural History of Man, &c.; London: Bailli√®re. Prichard was an early member of the Aborigines' Protection Society. = Psychiatry = In medicine, he specialised in what is now psychiatry. In 1822 he published A Treatise on Diseases of the Nervous SystemOpen Library page (pt. I), and in 1835 a Treatise on Insanity and Other Disorders Affecting the Mind, in which he advanced the theory of the existence of a distinct mental illness called moral insanity. Prichard's work was also the first definition of senile dementia in the English language. Augstein has suggested that these works were aimed at the prevalent materialist theories of mind, phrenology and craniology.Hannah Franziska Augstein, \\"J. C. Prichard's Concept of Moral Insanity: a medical theory of the corruption of human nature\\", Medical History; 1996, 40: 311-343; (PDF), at p. 316. She has also suggested that Prichard was influenced by the somatic school of German Romantic psychiatric thought, in particular Christian Friedrich Nasse, and (eclectically) Johann Christian August Heinroth; this in addition to an acknowledged debt to Jean- √âtienne Dominique Esquirol.Augstein, pp. 319 and 314. In 1842, following up on moral insanity, he published On the Different Forms of Insanity in Relation to Jurisprudence, designed for the use of persons concerned in legal questions regarding unsoundness of mind.Open Library page = Other works = Among his other works were: *1819: Analysis of Egyptian Mythology *1829: A Review of the Doctrine of a Vital Principle *1831: On the Treatment of Hemiplegia *1839: On the Extinction of some Varieties of the Human Race Family He married Anne Maria Estlin, daughter of John Prior Estlin and sister of John Bishop Estlin.

He was a pioneer in modern brain surgery, considered the father of neurosurgery and contributed to the development of bone graft surgery, the surgical treatment of hernia and of pneumonectomy (removal of the lungs). Career Macewen was born near Port Bannatyne, near Rothesay on the Isle of Bute, in western Scotland in 1848. He studied Medicine at the University of Glasgow, receiving a medical degree in 1872. He was greatly influenced by Joseph, Lord Lister (1827‚Äì1912), who revolutionised surgery by developing antisepsis, by the use of phenol, thus decreasing drastically the enormous mortality of surgical patients due to infections. By following Lister and adopting systematically the use of scrubbing (deep cleansing and disinfection of hands and arms), sterilisation of surgical tools, use of surgical gowns, and (recently discovered) anaesthesia, Macewen became one of the most innovative surgeons of his time and was able to greatly advance modern surgical technique and improve the recovery of patients. In 1875, he became an assistant surgeon at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, being promoted to full surgeon in 1877. Around 1880 he began a training programme for nurses (focussing upon sterilisation) at the infirmary under the charge of the Matron, Mrs Rebecca Strong (1843-1944).Hunterian Museum, case notes on Macewen display In 1881 he was appointed lecturer on Systematic Surgery at the Royal Infirmary School of Medicine. In 1883 he was appointed as Surgeon to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. In 1892 Macewen became Regius Professor of Surgery at the University of Glasgow (the post which Lister had held when Macewen was a student) and transferred his surgical activities to the Western Infirmary. In 1896, Macewan was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. He was knighted in the 1902 Coronation Honours for services to medicine, receiving the accolade from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October that year. In 1916 Macewen helped to found the Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers in Erskine (now the Erskine Hospital), near Glasgow, which was urgently needed to treat the thousands of military that lost their limbs in the First World War. Macewen was its first chief surgeon and with the help of engineers and workers of the nearby Yarrow Shipbuilders, he designed the Erskine artificial limb. He trained a team of pattern-makers to manufacture them for the hospital. Macewen died in Glasgow on 22 March 1924. He lived at Garrochty on the Isle of Bute until his death, and was buried nearby in the churchyard of St Blane's Church at Kingarth. Neurosurgery Following the work of John Hughlings Jackson (1835‚Äì1911) and David Ferrier (1843‚Äì1924) on neurological mapping of functions in the brain, Macewen demonstrated in 1876 that it was possible to use a precise clinical examination to determine the possible site of a tumor or lesion in the brain, by observing its effects on the side and extension of alterations in motor and sensory functions. Thus, in 1876 he diagnosed an abscess in the frontal lobe of a boy, but the family refused permission to operate. When the patient died his diagnosis and localisation were found to be correct. In 1879 he performed the first successful intracranial surgery where the site of the lesion (a left frontal meningioma) was localized solely by the preoperative focal epileptic signs (twitching of the face and arms in the opposite site of the lesion). On the basis of these signs Macewen thought that there was good evidence of an ‚Äúirritation to the lower and middle portions of the ascending convolutions‚Ä¶in the left frontal lobe‚Äù. A trephined hole in the skull near the purported site of the lesion showed a big subdural tumor. The patient, a teenage girl, lived for eight more years, and a subsequent autopsy showed no trace of the tumor. He later used this many times to successfully operate on brain abscesses (in 1876) and hematomas and on the spine. This was a great triumph of medicine. According to one of his biographers, \\"his thorough knowledge of the natural history of pyogenic diseases of the temporal bone and nasal sinuses, in addition to his clear description of cranial anatomy, as illustrated in his Atlas of Head Sections, were especially important in developing his successful treatment of brain abscess. The X-ray had not yet been discovered; Macewen's diagnosis was based on clinical findings superbly illustrated by his three clinical stages of brain abscess development\\" (Canale, 1996). Contributions to surgery Macewen demonstrates his triangle to Lane, Hirschfelder, Barkan and Stillman. One of his earliest contributions while at the Royal Infirmary, in 1877, was in orthopaedics, by means of the development of the first bone grafts, but also in knee surgery using a special instrument (Macewen's osteotome) both techniques becoming key treatments for the highly prevalent disease of rickets (caused by a lack of Vitamin D). Macewen was interested in the biology of bone and carried out a classical series of experiments on animals in order to determine how bones grow and may be repaired. He developed surgical treatments for mastoid disease and pyogenic cysts of the temporal bone and has identified an anatomical structure in this bone, the foveola suprameatica, which was named MacEwen's triangle in his honour. His method of surgical removal of lungs became a major medical weapon in the treatment of tuberculosis and lung cancer, thus saving many patients. His name was also immortalised in Medicine in two other instances: the Macewen's operation for inguinal hernia and the Macewen's sign for hydrocephalus and brain abscess. Another important contribution by Macewen to modern surgery was the technique of endotracheal anaesthesia with the help of orotracheal intubation, which he described in 1880, and still in use today. Macewen was noted for his early and creative use of photographs for documenting patients cases and for teaching surgery and medicine. He pioneered the use of photos of body parts and pathological specimens, as well as photos taken before, after and during treatment/surgery.

His great- grandfather William Tuke and his grandfather Henry Tuke co-founded the Retreat, which revolutionized the treatment of insane people. His father Samuel Tuke carried on the work of the York Retreat and reported on its methods and its results. Daniel's older brother James Hack Tuke (1819‚Äì1896) was the next overseer of the York Retreat. Daniel was the youngest son of Samuel Tuke and Priscilla Hack, his wife. Tuke's son was the painter Henry Scott Tuke. Career In 1845 Daniel Tuke entered the office of a solicitor at Bradford, but in 1847 began work at the York Retreat. Entering St Bartholomew's Hospital in London in 1850, he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1852, and graduated M.D. at Heidelberg in 1853. In 1853 he visited a number of foreign asylums, and later returning to York he became visiting physician to the York Retreat and the York Dispensary, lecturing also to the York School of Medicine on mental diseases. In 1859 ill health obliged him to give up his work, and for the next fourteen years he lived at Falmouth. In 1875, he settled in London as a specialist in mental diseases.

It is considered to provide, \\"the stiffest government emergency powers of any emergency law in Canada.\\" It received royal assent on July 21, 1988, replacing the War Measures Act. The Emergencies Act differs from the War Measures Act in two important ways: # A declaration of an emergency by the Cabinet must be reviewed by Parliament # Any temporary laws made under the act are subject to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Thus any attempt by the government to suspend the civil rights in Canada, even in an emergency, will be subject to the \\"reasonable and justified\\" test under section 1 of the Charter. Uses The Emergencies Act has never been used. The War Measures Act, which this act replaced, was used on three occasions: during both the First and Second World Wars, and during the 1970 October Crisis. On April 9, 2020, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sent a letter to the provincial and territorial premiers to consult about invoking the Emergencies Act due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. While consultation with the provinces is a required step before the Act can be triggered, the Prime Minister's Office said there was no present plan to enact it and that doing so remained a last resort. On a conference call between Trudeau and the premiers later that day, the premiers communicated their unanimous opposition to invoking the Act.

Her relatively short film career began in the 1920s during the era of silent films and ended in 1936. Although her career only lasted around twelve years, the blonde blue- eyed ingenue and leading lady appeared in more than 50 film roles and remained a press favorite, with numerous magazine covers. Early life, stage and modelling She was born in New York City to vaudeville comedy performers John Hyams, (1869-1940) and Leila (n√©e McIntyre) Hyams (1882-1953). Both parents appeared in films and mother Leila Senior was also a noted stage performer; her parents can later be seen together in several Hollywood films such as in 1939's The Housekeeper's Daughter. Hyams appeared on stage with her parents while still a child, working in their vaudeville act for five years. As a teenager, she worked as a model and became well known across the United States after appearing in a successful series of newspaper advertisements. This success led her to Hollywood. Film career Photoplay, 1929 She made her first film in 1924, and with her blonde hair, green eyes, delicate features, and good-natured demeanor, was cast in a string of supporting roles, where she was required to do very little but smile and look pretty. She proved herself capable of handling the small roles she was assigned, and over a period of time, she came to be taken seriously as an actress. By 1928, she was playing starring roles, achieving success in MGM's first talkie release, Alias Jimmy Valentine (1928) opposite William Haines, Lionel Barrymore, and Karl Dane. The following year, she appeared in the popular murder mystery The Thirteenth Chair, a role that offered her the chance to display her dramatic abilities as a murder suspect. At Fox that same year, she appeared in director Allan Dwan's now lost romantic adventure The Far Call opposite Charles Morton. The quality of her parts continued to improve as the decade turned, including a role as Robert Montgomery's sister in the prison drama The Big House (1930) with Chester Morris and Wallace Beery, for which Hyams once again received positive reviews. She then appeared in Surrender (1931) in which Warner Baxter and Ralph Bellamy desperately competed for her attention.Hyams in 1932 Although she succeeded in films that required her to play pretty ingenues, and developed into a capable dramatic actress in 1930s crime melodramas, she is perhaps best remembered for two early 1930s horror movies, as the wise- cracking but kind-hearted circus performer in Freaks (1932) and as the heroine in the Bela Lugosi film Island of Lost Souls (1932). Hyams was the original choice to play Jane in Tarzan the Ape Man (1932), but turned it down. The role was played by Maureen O'Sullivan. She also appeared in the once controversial Jean Harlow film Red-Headed Woman (1932), the musical comedy The Big Broadcast (1932) with Bing Crosby, George Burns, and Gracie Allen, and was praised for her comedic performance in Ruggles of Red Gap (1935). In 1935 she made 1,000 Dollars a Minute for Republic and retired soon after. Personal life Hyams with co-star Richard Dix in Yellow Dust (1936) Hyams married her agent Phil Berg in 1927. In 1936, after a 12-year acting career and performing in 50 films, she retired from the motion-picture industry; nevertheless, she remained active in the Hollywood community for the rest of her life. In 1977, after a \\"brief illness\\", Hyams died at age 72 at her home in Bel-Air in Los Angeles. She was survived by her husband Phil.

Baum served under another German officier, Major General Friedrich Adolf Riedesel, commanding the Dragoon Regiment \\"Prinz Ludwig\\" of the Braunschweiger J√§ger in support of General John Burgoyne's 1777 campaign to attack the Lake Champlain- Hudson River corridor, which ended in Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga on October 15, 1777. Battle of Bennington  For Baum, the campaign ended at the Battle of Bennington, on August 16, 1777. Arriving in Canada with the Brunswick army in the winter of 1776, Burgoyne detailed Baum with around 600 Brunswickers, British, and Indians from Fort Edward to try to collect provisions, horses, and Loyalist reinforcements for Burgoyne's main force for the march south toward Albany. However, nearly 2,000 rebels, consisting of New Hampshire forces under John Stark and the remnants of Seth Warner's Green Mountain Boys following the costly Battle of Hubbardton, were arrayed against Baum's men. Also among Stark's forces were Massachusetts men under Reverend Thomas Allen, leading a contingent of Pittsfield militia. Allen, who had been outraged at the abandonment of Fort Ticonderoga to Burgoyne at the beginning of July, complained to Stark that if his men did not get to fight at Bennington they would never answer another call to arms. Although Baum had served in several engagements in Europe during the Seven Years' War, he had little battlefield command experience. In contrast, his adversary Stark had served with Robert Rogers' Rangers, including the Battle of Ticonderoga; and he had distinguished himself as an American leader at Bunker Hill, Trenton, and Princeton. Baum's lack of experience showed at Bennington, where he encamped his forces in such a way that they were separated and unable to communicate easily with each other. Communications were also hampered in some degree by the inability of Baum, who spoke only German, to speak English. Baum had been assigned a loyalist from the nearby region to guide his forces and attest to the character of any indigenous people encountered along the way. According to a field report that was later published in the London Gazette by Burgoyne himself: Putting his superior numbers to best use, Stark surrounded each of Baum's forces and attacked simultaneously, overwhelming each redoubt. In the mel√©e, Baum was captured after sustaining a mortal stomach wound, from which his surgeon, Julius Friedrich Wasmus, also captured, was unable to save him. Seeing he was badly outnumbered, Baum had requested reinforcements from Burgoyne, who sent Lieutenant Colonel Heinrich von Breymann and a corps of light infantrymen and Brunswick grenadiers to support him. However, Breymann, who disliked Baum, marched slowly to the site, making less than one mile per hour, arriving after Baum had already been overrun and captured. Legacy Colonel Baum Road, which runs through the Washington County, New York town of Easton, just south of the Village of Greenwich, is named for Baum. Notes  References  * Richard M.

Provincial elections use paper ballots, some provinces have introduced computer ballot counting (vote tabulators), and the Northwest Territories has experimented with Internet voting for absentee voting. Paper ballots with computer vote tabulators have been used since at least the 1990s at the municipal level. A federal committee has recommended against national Internet voting. Committee reports and analysis from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia have all recommended against provincial Internet voting. Elections Quebec has studied Internet voting and wants to continue to do so. Some municipalities in Ontario and Nova Scotia provide Internet voting. There are no Canadian electronic voting standards.  Federal  There is no electronic or online voting in Canadian federal elections. Paper ballots are hand-counted. For national elections, there is a uniform set of standards for voting. This governing law is the Canada Elections Act. The Act is c. 9, assented to (made law) 31 May 2000. It has been amended several times since 2000. In 2014, it was amended (2014, c. 12, s. 8.) to require the prior approval of a majority in both the Senate and House of Commons for electronic voting, rather than just Senate and House committees. The relevant provision applying to electronic voting is: PART 2 CHIEF ELECTORAL OFFICER AND STAFF > Alternative voting process 18.1 The Chief Electoral Officer may carry out > studies on voting, including studies respecting alternative voting > processes, and may devise and test an alternative voting process for future > use in a general election or a by-election.

Elections Canada released a report requesting approval to conduct an \\"electronic voting test-run in a byelection by 2013\\". The tests of online voting never took place. = 2010 Federal Dialogue on Internet Voting = On January 26, 2010 Elections Canada in conjunction with partners organised The Canada-Europe Transatlantic Dialogue (Strategic Knowledge Cluster) - Internet Voting: What Can Canada Learn? Examples of Internet voting from Europe and from Canadian municipalities were presented. = 2016 Federal Consultation on Electoral Reform, Including Online Voting = On June 7, 2016, the House of Commons created a Special Committee on Electoral Reform. The committee was charged \\"to identify and conduct a study of viable alternate voting systems to replace the first-past-the-post system, as well as to examine mandatory voting and online voting\\". The committee's report was issued December 1, 2016 and recommended against online voting. In parallel with the committee, starting August 26, 2016 the then Minister of Democratic Institutions Maryam Monsef conducted a cross-country consultation tour on the same topics. The in-person consultation was followed with a Minister of Democractic Institutions online consultation that launched December 5, 2016. = 2017 Statement from Elections Canada = The statement \\"Elections Canada has no plans to introduce electronic casting or counting of votes. Polling places will continue using paper ballots, marked and counted by hand.\\" is included in an advanced notice of proposed procurement for Electronic Polls Books issued March 2, 2017. = 2017 Government of Canada Statement Confirming No National Online Voting = On April 3, 2017 the Government of Canada responded to the recommendations of the Special Committee on Electoral Reform, and accepted the recommendation against online voting, stating \\"We will not implement online voting at this time.\\" = 2017 Communications Security Establishment Report and Minister of Democratic Institutions Mandate Letter = Released February 1, 2017, the Mandate Letter for incoming Minister of Democratic Institutions Karina Gould signaled a concern about cyber threats to the Canadian electoral process: > In collaboration with the Minister of National Defence and the Minister of > Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, lead the Government of Canada‚Äôs > efforts to defend the Canadian electoral process from cyber threats.

As well, ask CSE to offer advice to > Canada‚Äôs political parties and Elections Canada on best practices when it > comes to cyber security. On June 16, 2017 the Communications Security Establishment released the report indicated in the Minister's Mandate Letter. The report is entitled Cyber Threats to Canada's Democratic Process. The report states that multiple types of adversaries are targeting Canada, including nation-states and cybercriminals. It finds that federal elections are well-protected due to being conducted on paper with good control measures. > Federal elections are largely paper-based and Elections Canada has a number > of legal, procedural, and information technology measures in place, which > mitigate cyber threats. = 2020 Elections Canada Statement on Impact of COVID-19 on the ways to vote = On May 26, 2020 Elections Canada released a statement about voting during the COVID-19 pandemic, including a statement about Internet voting. > At this point, Elections Canada is not considering introducing internet > voting.

Provincial  Each province can choose its own voting machines and standards. = Alberta = Alberta does not permit the use of Internet voting in provincial elections. = British Columbia = British Columbia does not permit the use of Internet voting in provincial elections. A February 2014 Independent Panel on Internet Voting recommended \\"Do not implement universal Internet voting for either local government or provincial government elections at this time.\\" The October 2014 Report of the Chief Electoral Officer indicated \\"Elections BC endorses the recommendations of the Independent Panel on Internet Voting\\". = New Brunswick = It was reported in the Globe and Mail on May 13, 2004 that \\"New Brunswick's chief electoral officer is reviewing the possibility of using electronic voting machines on a wide basis.\\" New Brunswick used vote counting computers in 2014 and encountered problems, but did not expect to change the system in 2018.  2016-2017 Commission on Electoral Reform  On July 5, 2016, the governing Liberals tabled a discussion on electoral paper in the legislature and signaled the formation of a Commission on Electoral Reform. The discussion paper included online voting as one of the ideas. On November 9, 2016 the five electoral reform commissioners were announced. The Commission on Electoral Reform held public meetings in January 2017. The Commission report recommended against online voting. The recommendations from the Commission on Electoral Reform were submitted to the clerk of the Executive Council on March 1, 2017. = Nova Scotia = Nova Scotia does not permit the use of Internet voting in provincial elections. In a 2013 report, the Election Commission of Nova Scotia concluded that \\"it is premature to entertain either Internet based or telephone voting options at this time.\\" = Ontario = Ontario does not permit the use of Internet voting in provincial elections. A three-year study of \\"network voting\\" concluded in 2013 that \\"At this point, we do not have a viable method of network voting that meets our criteria and protects the integrity of the electoral process.\\" Ontario did a pilot of electronic vote counting in a provincial byelection in 2016. They spent $32 million, and electronic vote counting took one hour less than hand counting. They expect to use it province-wide in 2018 and hire only 55,000 poll workers, instead of 100,000, but costs will still rise from $78 million to $126 million. \\"The public has an expectation as a modern society to expect modern services and this is what we‚Äôre trying to do,\\" said a spokeswoman for Elections Ontario. = Prince Edward Island = In Prince Edward Island's 2016 plebiscite on electoral reform residents were able to cast their vote in-person, online, or by touch-tone telephone. This was the first time a provincial plebiscite offered online and telephone voting options. = Quebec = Quebec does not permit the use of Internet voting or electronic voting. On October 24, 2006 the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec released a report (in French only) \\"Report on the Evaluation of New Methods of Voting\\". In a press release, three root causes of problems with electronic voting machines in the 2005 municipal elections were identified: * an imprecise legislative and administrative framework * absence of technical specifications, norms and standards * poor management of voting systems (especially lack of security measures) He recommended that the moratorium on the use of these systems be maintained, and left it up to the provincial legislature to decide whether or not to use electronic voting in future. The moratorium remains in place.  Municipal  Each municipality can choose its own voting machines and standards, although in some provinces municipalities are required to follow provincial standards and regulations. For more information about the elections themselves, see Municipal elections in Canada. Ontario and Nova Scotia permit municipal Internet voting, upon approval by individual city councils. = Alberta = As of 2013, Alberta does not support the use of online voting in municipal elections. Edmonton, Alberta offered touch-screen voting machines for advance voting in 2004. = New Brunswick = Saint John, New Brunswick used optical scanning machines in the 2004 municipal election. = Nova Scotia =  2016 Municipal Elections  20 communities used Internet voting as a voting method in the 2016 Nova Scotia municipal elections. Internet and telephone voting combined turnout in Halifax dropped by more than 10,000 compared to 2012. The internet and telephone voting system was contracted to the Spanish company Scytl and the Canadian company Intelivote Systems. Digby, Nova Scotia (population approximately 2,000) offered only Internet and telephone as voting options; no paper ballots.  2012 Municipal Elections  16 communities with a combined population of 490,490 used Internet voting as a voting method in the 2012 Nova Scotia municipal elections. Digby, Nova Scotia (population approximately 2,000) offered only Internet and telephone as voting options; no paper ballots.  2008 Municipal Elections  4 communities with a combined population of 284,768 used Internet voting as a voting method in the 2008 Nova Scotia municipal elections. In the 2008 Halifax Regional Municipality municipal election, residents of the Halifax Regional Municipality had the option of advance voting over the Internet. Voters received a PIN in a letter sent specifically in their name to their address, and needed the PIN plus their date of birth to identify themselves to the system. = Ontario = See Municipal elections in Ontario for a list of elections.  2018 Municipal Elections  Over 150 municipalities in Ontario conducted their elections primarily online, with physical polling stations either abandoned entirely or limited to only a few central polling stations for voters who could not or did not want to vote online.\\"How e-voting is taking over Ontario municipal elections\\". TVOntario, October 8, 2018. Municipalities contracted with election companies, including Intelivote Systems, Dominion Voting Systems and Simply Voting Inc.https://www.durhamregion.com/news-story/8567599-ajax-using-internet- voting-in-fall-municipal-election/ Voters used a PIN number to identify themselves. On election day, 51 of these municipalities, all of which had selected Dominion Voting Systems as their online voting contractor, were affected by a technical failure. Dominion subcontracted processing to another company (colocation centre), which capped internet connections in the early evening, without authorization from or consultation with Dominion. They could not handle the early evening increase in voting traffic, thus making it impossible for many voters to get through to the server between 5:00 and 7:30 p.m.\\"Bandwidth glitch delays Sudbury's municipal election\\". Sudbury Star, October 23, 2018. All of the affected municipalities extended voting for at least a few hours to compensate for the outage; several, including Pembroke, Waterloo, Prince Edward County and Greater Sudbury, opted to extend voting for a full 24 hours into the evening of October 23.\\"Technical problems force many Ontario municipalities to extend voting\\". CTV News, October 23, 2018.  2014 Municipal Elections  97 communities (out of a potential 414 that ran elections) used Internet voting as a voting method. Leamington, Ontario (population approximately 28,000) provided Internet voting as the only option in the 2014 municipal election; no paper ballots. Coburg, Ontario (population approximately 18,000) provided only Internet and telephone voting in 2014; no paper ballots.  2010 Municipal Elections  44 communities with a combined population of 800,887 used Internet voting as a voting method in the 2010 Ontario municipal elections. CTV reported that 33 municipalities used the Intelivote Internet and telephone voting system. \\"The online and telephone voting system was used by 33 municipalities, causing several problems across the region.\\" Other municipalities extended their voting period by one hour. In the Huntsville, Ontario election there was Internet voting provided by Canadian company Intelivote. There was an error in sending some of the PINs out by postal mail; as a result, replacement PINs were mailed out. Arnprior, Ontario provided Internet and telephone voting and was forced to extend voting by a further 24 hours due to problems with people logging into the Intelivote system. The issue was traced to a hardware failure of one of the servers due to higher than expected load. Coburg, Ontario (population approximately 18,000) provided only Internet and telephone voting in 2010; no paper ballots.  2006 Municipal Elections  20 communities with a combined population of 397,537 used Internet voting as a voting method in the 2006 Ontario municipal elections. In an effort to address accessibility issues Kingston, Ontario offered touch-screen voting machines for advance voting in 2006 supplied by Diebold Election Systems. Diebold Election Systems became Premier Election Solutions, whose primary assets have been purchased by Dominion Voting Systems. Peterborough, Ontario introduced Internet voting in 2006 in addition to the more traditional methods. In 2006, Markham again used Internet voting and experienced a 48% growth in online voting.  2003 Municipal Elections  12 communities with a combined population of 255,837 used Internet voting as a voting method in the 2003 Ontario municipal elections. The Ottawa municipal elections have used optical scan machines since at least 2003. Markham, Ontario introduced an Internet voting system in 2003. The system was supplied by US company Election Systems & Software at a cost of $25,000. Windsor, Ontario used touch-screen balloting in a 2002 by-election and in the 2003 Ontario Municipal Election, but only at their advance polls.  Previous Elections  Since 1988, the City of St. Catharines has been using optical scan voting technology for tabulating votes during the Municipal Elections. Jonathon Hollins, Canadian director of Election Systems & Software reports that \\"Voting on standalone touch-screen machines (Direct Recording Electronics), ... which also caters to the visually-impaired through an audio ballot, has been used in municipal elections held in Toronto, Edmonton, and the Ontario cities of Vaughan, Brantford, Oakville and Mississauga. A 2000 year-end report from Global Election Systems (formerly called Diebold Election Systems and now called Premier Election Solutions) states \\"Global reports add- on sales of 60 AccuVote systems to the City of Ottawa and 70 to the City of Hamilton as well as first-time sales of 60 AccuVote-TS systems to the City of Barrie\\". = Quebec = Quebec held municipal elections in 2005. Numerous problems were reported with the voting machines used, and Pierre Bourque of Vision Montreal called for some re-votes. Approximately one year later, the Quebec Chief Electoral Officer released a report highly critical of the systems and processes used. As a result of the report, a moratorium on the use of electronic voting in municipal elections has been in place in Quebec since 2006.

Late Jurassic shales, Kimmeridgian/Oxfordian, are the source rocks. Pressure will be maintained via water injection. Exploration before development Exploration drilling to map the field began in the 1960s and continued into the 1980s, with the loss of the Ocean Ranger mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) in the process. In the mid-1980s, a new Conservative federal government under Brian Mulroney pledged that then Crown corporation Petro-Canada (now part of Suncor Energy) would be a lead player in creating a commercially viable offshore development on the Hibernia field. Hibernia would become one of a series of regional \\"mega-projects\\" that Mulroney's government started across Canada during this time.LA Times, 19 July 1988 Development Following several years of aborted startup attempts, during which time the federal government was forced to increase its liability stake in the project by forming the Crown corporation Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDEV), the Hibernia megaproject began construction of the production platform and gravity base structure in the early 1990s.Hibernia Milestones The Hibernia offshore oil field is owned jointly by ExxonMobil Canada (33.125%), Chevron Canada Resources (26.875%), Suncor (20%), Canada Hibernia Holding Corporation (8.5%; subsidiary of CDEV), Murphy Oil (6.5%) and StatoilHydro Canada Ltd (5%).Hibernia Shareholder Companies As the Hibernia field is located in an inhospitable environment consisting of rogue waves, fog, icebergs and sea ice, hurricanes, and nor'easter winter storms, engineering analyses determined that the most appropriate drilling platform would be in the form of a gravity base structure (GBS).Hibernia Ice Management The Hibernia GBS sits on the ocean floor approximately depth with its topsides extending approximately out of the water. The platform acts as a small concrete island with serrated outer edges designed to counter icebergs. The GBS contains production storage tanks for 1.3 million barrels of oil in an 85 m high caisson, with the entire structure weighing 587,000 tonne before 450,000 tonnes of solid ballast were added.Offshore TechnologyHibernia Construction The GBS was constructed in Bull Arm and the \\"topsides\\" production and living quarters was attached to the base while floating in Bull Arm, before the integrated unit (production platform and GBS) was towed out to the actual Hibernia field. Production commenced on November 17, 1997. A dedicated fleet of shuttle tankers continuously operates between the platform and an onshore transshipment facility at Whiffen Head, adjacent to the Come By Chance Refinery.Hibernia Platform Support During peak construction in 1995, 5800 workers were employed. Many of these people received training in construction management and high technology. Others received an upgrading of their skills as a result of this project. The development of Hibernia involves a considerable amount of drilling services. As of January 1, 2007, over 50 development wells have been successfully drilled from the platform, including a Canadian record \\"extended reach drilling\\" well. The platform always has at least one logistics support vessel in attendance, which shuttle supplies and provides on-station emergency support. These support vessels are also tasked during the spring and summer months to tow small and medium-sized icebergs which might collide with the platform, even though the GBS is engineered to withstand such a hit. The crew consists of 280 people who spend 3 weeks on the platform and three weeks on land, flown to and from the platform by helicopter. The platform has been used to refuel CH-149 Cormorant search and rescue helicopters on long-range missions in the North Atlantic. Production The Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board listed the total oil field production at as of August 2010.

Life Born at York, England in into a Quaker family, he was the son of Samuel Tuke and his wife Priscilla Hack; their seventh child, he had Daniel Hack Tuke as a brother. He was educated at the Religious Society of Friends school there, and after working for a time in his father's wholesale tea business, became in 1852 a partner in the banking firm of Sharples and Co., and went to live at Hitchin in Hertfordshire. For eighteen years Tuke was treasurer of the Friends Foreign Mission Association, and for eight years chairman of the Friends Central Education Board. But he is mainly remembered for his philanthropic work in Ireland, after a visit to Connaught in 1847, and of the scenes of distress which he witnessed. In addition to relief, his eye- witness testimony brought further relief to the west of IrelandChristine Kinealy, Charity and the Great Hunger in Ireland. The Kindness of Strangers, Bloomsbury, 2013 In 1880, accompanied by William Edward Forster, he spent two months in the West of Ireland distributing relief which had been privately subscribed by Friends in England. Letters descriptive of the state of things he saw were published in The Times, and in his pamphlet, Irish Distress and its Remedies (1880), he pointed out that Irish distress was due to economic rather than political difficulties, and advocated state-aided land purchase, peasant proprietorship, light railways, government help for the fishing and local industries, and family emigration for the poorest peasants. From 1882 to 1884 he worked continuously in Ireland superintending the emigration of poor families to the United States and the British Empire. The failure of the potato crop in Ireland in 1885 again called forth Tuke's energy, and on the invitation of the government, aided by public subscription, he purchased and distributed seed potatoes to avert a famine. His reports and letters to The Times, reprinted under the title The Condition of Donegal (1889), contributed to support for the bill passed for the construction of light railways in 1889 and the Irish Land Act which established the Congested Districts Board in 1891.

He was a major figure in founding The Retreat at Lamel Hill in York for treating mental-health needs. Tuke and his wife Esther Maud supported stricter adherence to Quaker principles. He was an abolitionist, a patron of the Bible Society, and an opponent of the East India Company's inhumane practices. Early life William Tuke was born on 24 March 1732 in York into a prominent Quaker family. His father Samuel was a stuff-weaver and shopkeeper, who died when Tuke was 16. His mother Ann died seven years later. Tuke attended boarding school for two or three years, after which he pursued further studies under clergymen. At age 14, he began an apprenticeship at his aunt's wholesale tea business, which he inherited on her death in 1746. Family life Tuke married Elizabeth Hoyland in 1754 and fathered four children. After Elizabeth died giving birth to their fifth child, Tuke met and married Esther Maud in 1765. Tuke and his wife were deeply involved in the Friends community and advocated stricter adherence to Quaker principles. For five decades, he travelled to London for the Yearly Meeting, serving as clerk there in 1783. Meanwhile, Tuke remained involved in the family business alongside his eldest son and business partner, Henry. Ann Tuke, his daughter by Esther Maud, married William Alexander of the prominent Ipswich Quaker banking family. The Retreat In 1791, William Tuke was moved by an incident involving Hannah Mills, a melancholic Quaker widow, who died unexpectedly at York Lunatic Asylum. Although her cause of death was unclear, mistreatment was suspected and the managers had forbidden Mills from having visitors. Tuke's daughter Ann proposed founding a mental institution run by Quakers for their own members. At a Society of Friends meeting in March 1792, Tuke presented his plan for those who \\"laboured under that most afflictive dispensation‚Äîthe loss of reason.\\" However, the proposal met with significant opposition. Some members felt such an institution was unnecessary, while others saw it as overstepping the jurisdiction of a Quaker community. The small minority of supporters included Tuke's son, Henry, and the grammarian Lindley Murray. During a visit to St. Luke's Hospital in London, Tuke witnessed appalling conditions for patients. He was particularly affected by a naked female patient who had been chained to a wall. Tuke believed the abuse was not cruel in intent, but marked a lack of effective alternatives. York Retreat original building c. 1796 By 1795, financial and social support from the community was still limited. The Society of Friends eventually approved the plan when Tuke's friend, Lindley Murray, suggested raising funds through annuities. Tuke bought 11 acres of land (4.5 ha) for ¬£938 and worked closely with a London architect, John Bevans, to carry out his vision for the new asylum. Unlike other institutions at the time, York Retreat featured long, airy corridors that allowed patients to stroll, even if they were kept from going outside. A month after the first patients arrived in June 1796, the unexpected death of its superintendent, Timothy Maud, forced Tuke to step in and run the Retreat himself. William Tuke allowed his doctors to make their own observations and apply them in practice. Bleeding and other traditional remedies were abandoned in favour of gentler methods, such as warm baths for patients with melancholia. Tuke believed that physical and mental health were inextricably linked and stressed the need for proper diet and exercise. He sought to instil a sense of reason, not fear, and limited the use of physical restraints. Patients were encouraged to make themselves comfortable and often took up tasks like sewing and knitting. The approach was widely derided at first. William Tuke noted, \\"All men seem to desert me.\\" However, it eventually became famous worldwide as a model of more humane and psychologically based approaches. Other work Outside his work at the Retreat, Tuke helped to found three Quaker schools: Ackworth School, Bootham School, and Trinity Lane Quaker Girls' School. The last was run by Tuke's second wife Esther until her death in 1794. The Tuke family continued to run it until 1812, by which time 500 students had passed through. As a patron of the Bible Society, Tuke attended its meetings and made generous donations. Tuke campaigned against the slave trade and supported the abolitionist William Wilberforce in the 1806 Yorkshire parliamentary election. Tuke was one of few voices in Britain opposing the East India Company for its inhumanity in other countries. He also subscribed to the African Institution, which set out to create a viable, civilized refuge for freed slaves in Sierra Leone, Africa. Towards the end of his career, a resurgence of patient abuse at York Asylum prompted Tuke to take to the local press and demand urgent reform. Tuke provided evidence to the Select Committee on Madhouses in May 1815, which led to further inquiries and passage of the County Asylums Act in 1828. Final years and death Tuke remained involved with the Retreat until he became blind at the age of 82. He died on 6 December 1822 after a paralytic attack. Legacy Several of Tuke's family pursued similar philanthropic work. The York Retreat was founded by his son Henry (1755‚Äì1815), at whose request his own son Samuel wrote an 1813 account of it and popularized the principles of \\"moral treatment\\". Samuel's son James Hack Tuke also helped to manage the York Retreat, while his brother Daniel Hack Tuke co-wrote A Manual of Psychological Medicine (1858) and became a leading medical expert in insanity. His daughter, Sarah Tuke Grubb, founded a school in Ireland.

A prolific author, he wrote extensively on a broad range of subjects, such as authenticity and death, moral philosophy and existentialism, theism and atheism, Christianity and Judaism, as well as philosophy and literature. He served more than 30 years as a professor at Princeton University. He is renowned as a scholar and translator of Friedrich Nietzsche. He also wrote a 1965 book on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and published a translation of Goethe's Faust. Biography Walter Kaufmann was born in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, on 1 July 1921.‚ÄúIntroduction\\" Walter Kaufmann: Philosopher, Humanist, Heretic, by STANLEY CORNGOLD, Princeton University Press, PRINCETON; OXFORD, 2019, pp. 1‚Äì10. Kaufmann was raised a Lutheran. At age 11, finding that he believed neither in the Trinity nor in the divinity of Jesus, he converted to Judaism. Kaufmann subsequently discovered that his grandparents were all Jewish. In 1939 Kaufmann emigrated to the United States and began studying at Williams College. Stanley Corngold records that there he \\"abandoned his commitment to Jewish ritual while developing a deeply critical attitude toward all established religions.\\" Kaufmann graduated from Williams College in 1941, then went to Harvard University, receiving an MA degree in Philosophy in 1942. His studies were, however, interrupted by the war. He enlisted with the US Army Air Force and would go on to serve as an interrogator for the Military Intelligence Service in Germany. Kaufmann became a citizen of the United States in 1944. In 1947 he was awarded his PhD by Harvard. His dissertation, written in under a year, was titled \\"Nietzsche's Theory of Values.\\" That same year he joined the Philosophy Department at Princeton University. And, although he would hold visiting appointments in both the US and abroad, he would remain based at Princeton for the rest of his academic career. His students over the years included Nietzsche scholars Frithjof Bergmann, Richard Schacht, Alexander Nehamas, and Ivan Soll. Kaufmann died, aged 59, on 4 September 1980. Philosophical work In a 1959 article in Harper's Magazine, he summarily rejected all religious values and practice, especially the liberal Protestantism of continental Europe that began with Schleiermacher and culminated in the writings of Paul Tillich and Rudolf Bultmann. In their place, he praised moralists such as the biblical prophets, the Buddha, and Socrates. He argued that critical analysis and the acquisition of knowledge were liberating and empowering forces. He forcefully criticized the fashionable liberal Protestantism of the 20th century as filled with contradictions and evasions, preferring the austerity of the book of Job and the Jewish existentialism of Martin Buber. Kaufmann discussed many of these issues in his 1958 Critique of Religion and Philosophy. Kaufmann wrote a good deal on the existentialism of S√∏ren Kierkegaard and Karl Jaspers. Kaufmann had great admiration for Kierkegaard's passion and his insights on freedom, anxiety, and individualism.Kaufmann, W (1980).Discovering the Mind: Goethe, Kant, and Hegel. New York: McGraw-Hill Co., p.26 Kaufmann wrote: \\"Nobody before Kierkegaard had seen so clearly that the freedom to make a fateful decision that may change our character and future breeds anxiety.\\" Although Kaufmann did not share Kierkegaard's religious outlook and was critical of his Protestant theology, Kaufmann was nevertheless sympathetic and impressed with the depth of Kierkegaard's thinking: Kaufmann edited the anthology Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre. Kaufmann disliked Martin Heidegger's thinking, along with his unclear writing.Denis Dutton, \\"Kaufmann, Heidegger, and Nazism\\" Philosophy and Literature 12 (1988): 325‚Äì36 Kaufmann is renowned for his translations and exegesis of Nietzsche, whom he saw as gravely misunderstood by English speakers, as a major early existentialist, and as an unwitting precursor, in some respects, to Anglo-American analytic philosophy. Michael Tanner called Kaufmann's commentaries on Nietzsche \\"obtrusive, self- referential, and lacking insight\\", but Llewellyn Jones wrote that Kaufmann's \\"fresh insights into ... Nietzsche ... can deepen the insights of every discriminating student of literature,\\"Jones, Llewellyn, The Humanist, Volume 21 (1961) quoted on the back cover of Kaufmann, Walter Arnold, From Shakespeare to Existentialism (Princeton University Press 1979), and The New Yorker wrote that Kaufmann \\"has produced what may be the definitive study of Nietzsche's ... thought‚Äîan informed, scholarly, and lustrous work.\\"Kaufman, Walter Arnold, Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist (Princeton University Press 1974), on back cover, , accessed 2012-Jul-29 Kaufmann wrote that superficially Kaufmann also sympathized with Nietzsche's acerbic criticisms of Christianity. However, Kaufmann faulted much in Nietzsche, writing that \\"my disagreements with [Nietzsche] are legion.\\" Regarding style, Kaufmann argued that Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, for example, is in parts badly written, melodramatic, or verbose, yet concluded that the book \\"is not only a mine of ideas, but also a major work of literature and a personal triumph.\\"Kaufmann, Walter (1976), \\"Editor's Preface\\" to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, in The Portable Nietzsche, New York: Penguin Books, pp. 120‚Äì124. Kaufmann described his own ethic and his own philosophy of living in his books, including The Faith of a Heretic: What Can I Believe? How Should I Live? What Do I Hope? (1961) and Without Guilt and Justice: From Decidophobia to Autonomy (1973).

D'√âon had androgynous physical characteristics and natural abilities as a mimic and a spy. D'√âon appeared publicly as a man and pursued masculine occupations for 49 years, although during that time d'√âon successfully infiltrated the court of Empress Elizabeth of Russia by presenting as a woman. For 33 years, from 1777, d'√âon lived as a woman. Doctors who examined d'√âon's body after death discovered \\"male organs in every respect perfectly formed\\", but also feminine characteristics. Early life Caricature of d'√âon dressed half in women's clothes, half in men's clothes D'√âon was born at the H√¥tel d'Uz√®s in Tonnerre, Burgundy, into a poor noble family. D'√âon's father, Louis d'√âon de Beaumont, was an attorney and director of the king's dominions, later mayor of Tonnerre and sub-delegate of the intendant of the g√©n√©ralit√© of Paris.J. M. J. Rogister, D'√âon de Beaumont, Charles Genevi√®ve Louis Auguste Andr√© Timoth√©e, Chevalier D'√âon in the French nobility (1728‚Äì1810), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Sept 2012 accessed 26 April 2013 D'√âon's mother, Fran√ßoise de Charanton, was the daughter of a Commissioner General to the armies of the wars of Spain and Italy. Most of what is known about d'√âon's early life comes from a partly ghost-written autobiography, The Interests of the Chevalier d'√âon de BeaumontD'Eon de Beaumont, his life and times archive.org and Bram Stoker's essay on the Chevalier in his 1910 book Famous Impostors. D'√âon excelled in school, moving from Tonnerre to Paris in 1743, graduating in civil law and canon law from the Coll√®ge Mazarin in 1749 at age 21. D'√âon began literary work as a contributor to Fr√©ron's Ann√©e litt√©raire, and attracted notice as a political writer by two works on financial and administrative questions, which were published in d'√âon's twenty-fifth year. D'√âon became secretary to Bertier de Sauvigny, intendant of Paris, served as a secretary to the administrator of the fiscal department, and was appointed a royal censor for history and literature by Malesherbes in 1758. Life as a spy In 1756, d'√âon joined the secret network of spies called the (King's Secret) employed by King Louis XV without the knowledge of the government. It sometimes promoted policies that contradicted official policies and treaties. According to d'√âon's memoirs (although there is no documentary evidence to support that account) the monarch sent d'√âon with the Chevalier Douglas, Alexandre-Pierre de Mackensie-Douglas, baron de Kildin, a Scottish Jacobite in French service, on a secret mission to Russia in order to meet Empress Elizabeth and conspire with the pro-French faction against the Habsburg monarchy. At that time the English and French were at odds, and the English were attempting to deny the French access to the Empress by allowing only women and children to cross the border into Russia. D'√âon later claimed having to pass convincingly as a woman or risk being executed by the English upon discovery and therefore travelled disguised as the lady Lia de Beaumont, and served as a maid of honour to the Empress. However, there is little or no evidence to support this and it is now commonly accepted to be a story told to demonstrate how identifying as female had been of benefit to France in the past. Eventually, Chevalier Douglas became French ambassador to Russia, and d'√âon was secretary to the embassy in Saint Petersburg from 1756 to 1760, serving Douglas and his successor, the marquis de l'H√¥pital. D'√âon's career in Russia is the subject of one of Valentin Pikul's novels, Le chevalier d'√âon et la guerre de Sept ans (¬´–ü–µ—Ä–æ–º –∏ —à–ø–∞–≥–æ–π¬ª). D'√âon returned to France in October 1760, and was granted a pension of 2,000 livres as reward for service in Russia. In May 1761, d'√âon became a captain of dragoons under the mar√©chal de Broglie and fought in the later stages of the Seven Years' War. D'√âon served at the Battle of Villinghausen in July 1761, and was wounded at Ultrop. After Empress Elizabeth died in January 1762, d'√âon was considered for further service in Russia, but instead was appointed secretary to the duc de Nivernais, awarded 1,000 livres, and sent to London to draft the peace treaty that formally ended the Seven Years' War. The treaty was signed in Paris on 10 February 1763, and d'√âon was awarded a further 6,000 livres, and received the Order of Saint-Louis on 30 March 1763, becoming the Chevalier d'√âon. The title , French for knight, is also sometimes used for French noblemen. Back in London, d'√âon became charg√© d'affaires in April 1763, and then plenipotentiary minister‚Äîessentially interim ambassador‚Äîwhen the duc de Nivernais returned to Paris in July. D'√âon used this position also to spy for the king. D'√âon collected information for a potential invasion‚Äîan unfortunate and clumsy initiative of Louis XV, of which Louis's own ministers were unaware‚Äîassisting a French agent, Louis Fran√ßois Carlet de la Rozi√®re, who was surveying the British coastal defences. D'√âon formed connections with English nobility by sending them the produce of d'√âon's vineyard in France; d'√âon abundantly enjoyed the splendour of this interim embassy. Upon the arrival of the new ambassador, the comte de Guerchy in October 1763, d'√âon was demoted to the rank of secretary and humiliated by the count. D'√âon was trapped between two French factions: Guerchy was a supporter of the duc de Choiseul, duc de Praslin and Madame de Pompadour, in opposition to the comte de Broglie and his brother the mar√©chal de Broglie. D'√âon complained, and eventually decided to disobey orders to return to France. In a letter to the king, d'√âon claimed that the new ambassador had tried to drug d'√âon at a dinner at the ambassador's residence in Monmouth House in Soho Square. The British government declined a French request to extradite d'√âon, and the 2,000 livres pension that had been granted in 1760 was stopped in February 1764. In an effort to save d'√âon's station in London, d'√âon published much of the secret diplomatic correspondence about d'√âon's recall under the title Lettres, m√©moires et n√©gociations particuli√®res du chevalier d'√âon in March 1764, disavowing Guerchy and calling him unfit for the job. This breach of diplomatic discretion was scandalous to the point of being unheard of, but d'√âon had not yet published everything (the King's secret invasion documents and those relative to the Secret du Roi were kept back as \\"insurance\\"), and the French government became very cautious in its dealings with d'√âon, even when d'√âon sued Guerchy for attempted murder. With the invasion documents in hand, d'√âon held the king in check. D'√âon did not offer any defense when Guerchy sued for libel, and d'√âon was declared an outlaw and went into hiding. However, d'√âon secured the sympathy of the British public: the mob jeered Guerchy in public, and threw stones at his residence. D'√âon then wrote a book on public administration, Les loisirs du Chevalier d'√âon, which was published in thirteen volumes in Amsterdam in 1774. Guerchy was recalled to France, and in July 1766 Louis XV granted d'√âon a pension (possibly a pay-off for d'√âon's silence) and a 12,000-livre annuity, but refused a demand for over 100,000 livres to clear d'√âon's extensive debts. D'√âon continued to work as a spy, but lived in political exile in London. D'√âon's possession of the king's secret letters provided protection against further actions, but d'√âon could not return to France. Life as a woman Despite the fact that d'√âon habitually wore a dragoon's uniform, rumours circulated in London that d'√âon was actually a woman. A betting pool was started on the London Stock Exchange about d'√âon's true sex. D'√âon was invited to join, but declined, saying that an examination would be dishonouring, whatever the result. After a year without progress, the wager was abandoned. Following the death of Louis XV in 1774, the was abolished, and d'√âon tried to negotiate a return from exile. The writer Pierre de Beaumarchais represented the French government in the negotiations. The resulting twenty-page treaty permitted d'√âon to return to France and retain the ministerial pension, but required that d'√âon turn over the correspondence regarding the . Madame Campan writes in her memoirs: \\"This eccentric being had long solicited permission to return to France; but it was necessary to find a way of sparing the family he had offended the insult they would see in his return; he was therefore made to resume the costume of that sex to which in France everything is pardoned. The desire to see his native land once more determined him to submit to the condition, but he revenged himself by combining the long train of his gown and the three deep ruffles on his sleeves with the attitude and conversation of a grenadier, which made him very disagreeable company.\\" The Chevalier d'√âon claimed to have been assigned female at birth, and demanded recognition by the government as such. D'√âon claimed to have been raised as a boy because Louis d'√âon de Beaumont could only inherit from his in-laws if he had a son. King Louis XVI and his court complied with this demand, but required in turn that d'√âon dress appropriately in women's clothing, although d'√âon was allowed to continue to wear the insignia of the Order of Saint-Louis. When the king's offer included funds for a new wardrobe of women's clothes, d'√âon agreed. In 1777, after fourteen months of negotiation, d'√âon returned to France and as punishment was banished to Tonnerre. Monsieur de Saint-George et Mademoiselle La chevali√®re d'√âon de Beaumont at Carlton House on 9 April 1787. Engraving by Victor Marie Picot, based on the original painting by Charles Jean Robineau. When France began to help the rebels during the American War of Independence, d'√âon asked to join the French troops in America, but d'√âon's banishment prevented it. In 1779, d'√âon published a book of memoirs: La Vie Militaire, politique, et priv√©e de Mademoiselle d'√âon. They were ghostwritten by a friend named La Fortelle and are probably embellished. D'√âon was allowed to return to England in 1785. The pension that Louis XV had granted was ended by the French Revolution, and d'√âon had to sell personal possessions, including books, jewellery and plate. The family's properties in Tonnerre were confiscated by the revolutionary government. In 1792, d'√âon sent a letter to the French National Assembly offering to lead a division of female soldiers against the Habsburgs, but the offer was rebuffed. D'√âon participated in fencing tournaments until seriously wounded in Southampton in 1796. D'√âon's last years were spent with a widow, Mrs. Cole. In 1804, d'√âon was sent to a debtors' prison for five months, and signed a contract for a biography to be written by Thomas William Plummer, which was never published. D'√âon became paralyzed following a fall, and spent a final four years bedridden, dying in poverty in London on 21 May 1810 at the age of 81. The surgeon who examined d'√âon's body attested in their post-mortem certificate, that the Chevalier had \\"male organs in every respect perfectly formed,\\" while at the same time displaying feminine characteristics. A couple of characteristics described in the certificate were \\"unusual roundness in the formation of limbs,\\" as well as \\"breast remarkably full.\\" This information suggests D'√âon might have been intersex. D'√âon's body was buried in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church, and d'√âon's remaining possessions were sold by Christie's in 1813. D'√âon's grave is listed on the Burdett-Coutts Memorial there as one of the important graves lost. Legacy D'Eon's name listed on the south face of the Burdett Coutts memorial Some of d'√âon's papers are at the Brotherton Library in Leeds, England. Some modern scholars have interpreted d'√âon as transgender. Havelock Ellis coined the term eonism to describe similar cases of transgender behavior; it is rarely used now. The Beaumont Society, a long-standing organisation for transgender people, is named after d'√âon. In 2012, a painting owned by the Philip Mould Gallery was identified as a portrait of d'√âon and purchased by the National Portrait Gallery, London. The Burdett-Coutts Memorial at St Pancras Gardens in London commemorates d'√âon as well as other people; in 2016 Historic England upgraded it to Grade II*. =Cultural depictions= The Chevalier d'√âon has appeared as a character in numerous fictional works over the years. * The Chevali√®re d'Eon, by Charles Dupeuty and the Baron de Maldigny (1837), Th√©√¢tre du VaudevilleThe Chevalier d'Eon and Other Short Farces from the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century French Theatre, By Frank J.

Biography He was born in Zaragoza, in Aragon, Spain on 7 January 1916 and died at Hospital Militar G√≥mez Ulla in Madrid on 31 July 1990 from a liver failure during or following surgery to remove a malignant tumor in the pancreas. He was interred in Madrid. Fernando Sancho fought in the spanish Civil War on the rebel side, being wounded several times and achieving the rank of lieutenant in the Legion.

He explored areas of South Australia, Western Australia and Cobourg Peninsula, Northern Territory. History Plaque on a monument dedicated to Captain Charles Sturt and Collet Barker, on Hindmarsh Island. Barker was born in Hackney, England, and lived in Newbury as a child. He joined the British Army on 23 January 1806, as an ensign by purchase in the 39th Regiment of Foot; he became a lieutenant in 1809 and a captain in 1825. Barker was a veteran of the Peninsular Wars, serving in Sicily, Portugal, Spain, and France. He also served in Canada and Ireland before embarking with his regiment, the 39th Regiment of Foot 1st Battalion, on the prison hulk Phoenix for Australia; he arrived in Sydney on 18 July 1828. =Northern Territory= On 13 September 1828 he arrived as the new commandant of Fort Wellington, the settlement at Raffles Bay in the Northern Territory. When Barker arrived to take up command at Fort Wellington, relations between the Aboriginal people and the settlers under the previous command of Captain Henry Smyth had deteriorated to the point of mutual fear and hostility. In his first dispatch to Governor Darling, Barker reported, \\"Nothing has been seen of the Natives for a considerable time; they appear to have deserted the immediate neighbourhood\\". A series of thefts and spearings by the Aborigines led to the former commandant offering a reward of five pounds for \\"any native who could be brought in, hoping that, by keeping such individual at the settlement, it might have the effect of preventing any further hostility\\".Darling to Huskisson, 3 September 1829, Historical Records of Australia. The result of this, to further quote Darling, was a \\"very gross outrage\\". A six-year-old Aboriginal girl named Riveral was captured during a raid on an encampment by six men from the settlement, including armed convicts., p. 74‚Äì77. Private Charles Miller, in evidence sworn to an enquiry, stated the following.Captain H. Smyth to Colonial Secretary Macleay, 12 February 1828, Historical Records of Australia, Series III, Volume VI, p. 781‚Äì789. It was with this background that Collet Barker began his command, on 13 September 1828. Barker first made contact with the local Aboriginal people on 25 November 1828, when Costello the stockman reported that he had made contact. Barker and Davis the surgeon were taken to the place of contact, where they met ten men, whom they presented with handkerchiefs, a pair of scissors, and some bread. The group invited Barker to accompany them, which Barker declined to do, though he tried to convey that he would be pleased to do so another time. Barker recorded his second contact with the local inhabitants in his journal, dated 2 December 1828, as follows.Journal of Capt. Collet Barker, 2 December 1828, P.43. (State Archives and Records Authority of New South Wales). It was soon after this that the aborigines approached the settlement and were induced to enter by Barker's sending Norrie, their Malay interpreter's daughter, to take Wellington's hand and lead him into the fort. Over the following months, Barker had restored relations to the point where he was able to go off alone with the locals on trips for days at a time with complete safety. One of the reasons for the establishment of the settlement was to try to establish commercial contacts with the Malay or Macassan fishers who regularly sailed their proas to the Northern shores of Australia in search of the trepang, or sea-slugs, which they traded with the Chinese. Over the course of the year over 1000 seafarers visited the shores of Raffles Bay and showed keen interest in establishing trade with Barker's outpost. Barker in his journals, records many Aboriginal names, words and aspects of Aboriginal culture gleaned through the regular contact that was developed with the local inhabitants. There continued to be sources of friction between the two cultures, especially the theft of the settlement's canoes. Barker solved this by negotiating to lend the canoes and found that by the July, they were being returned with fish and tortoise shell in them as thanks. Orders to abandon the settlement had been received before Barker's dispatches reporting the success of his contacts with the Macassan fishers and the improvements in their relations with the Aboriginal inhabitants could affect the outcome of Governor Darling's decision. Barker then moved on to become commandant of the British settlement at King George Sound, stopping off at the new settlement of Swan River, Perth, on the way. =Western Australia= The following year Barker was commander at King George Sound in Western Australia. Barker was an excellent administrator and proved to be a humane friend to the Indigenous people at both commands. He recorded Aboriginal place names, people, traditions and beliefs which otherwise might have been lost. =South Australia= In 1831, on the recommendation of Charles Sturt, who had visited the shoaled mouth of the Murray River the previous year, Barker was sent to explore the east coast of Gulf St Vincent in South Australia to see if another channel from the Murray entered the sea there. On 13 April 1831, Barker and his party arrived at Cape Jervis on the Isabella. He examined the coast and found that there was no channel. Barker encountered the Onkaparinga River on 15 April. He then explored the ranges inland, north of the present site of Adelaide, and climbed Mount Lofty where he sighted the Port River inlet, Barker Inlet and the future Port Adelaide, his most important sighting. He then moored Isabella near present Yankalilla Bay and went overland to explore the area around Lake Alexandrina and Encounter Bay. =Death= On 29 April 1831, they reached the mouth of the Murray River. Barker swam across the narrow channel the next morning, went over a sandhill, and was never seen again. A few days later the party learned that Barker had been killed by the local Indigenous people who may have taken him for a whaler or sealer, many of whom had abducted Indigenous women. The men responsible had been identified, but no retaliation or punitive action against those believed responsible was undertaken, which one commentator believed emboldened those people to commit further attacks on Europeans, notably the Maria survivors. Had he lived, Barker was to have been sent by Governor Darling to New Zealand's North Island as first resident because of the feared MƒÅori unrest; his role was to conciliate. Recognition Mount Barker was named for him by Captain Sturt, who erroneously thought it was Mount Lofty, and the eponymous town is named for the mountain. The town of Mount Barker, Western Australia and the electoral division of Division of Barker in south-eastern South Australia are also named for him. Personal life Captain Barker never married. His nearest relations were Collet Dobson Collet, nephew; Clara Collet, great niece; Edward Dobson, New Zealand engineer, nephew; and great nephews, Sir Arthur Dudley Dobson, New Zealand survey engineer, and George Dobson, New Zealand surveyor, who was murdered in 1866 by the Burgess gang.

The title character is a young bald boy who is mute (and sometimes drawn minus a mouth). With the exception of a few early episodes, the comic strip character communicates only through pantomime, a situation which changed when Henry moved into comic books. The Saturday Evening Post was the first publication to feature Henry, a series which began when Anderson was 67 years old. The series of cartoons continued in that magazine for two years in various formats of single panel, multiple panels or two panels. It then moved to newspaper syndication on December 17, 1934. Anderson stopped drawing due to arthritis in 1942, and the strip continued with other artists. The daily strip went into reruns in 1995, and the Sunday strip in 2005. After 84 years of syndication, Henry was discontinued on October 28, 2018. From cartoons to comic strip After seeing a German publication of Henry, William Randolph Hearst signed Anderson to King Features Syndicate and began distributing the comic strip on December 17, 1934, with the half-page Sunday strip launched March 10, 1935. Henry was replaced in The Saturday Evening Post by Marjorie Henderson Buell's Little Lulu. Anderson's Post cartoons featuring Henry are credited with early positive depictions of African-American characters during an era when African- Americans were often unflatteringly depicted. Carl Anderson's Henry began in The Saturday Evening Post (1932‚Äì34), and this 1932 single panel is one of the earliest. Others in The Saturday Evening Post series were two panels or multiple panels. Anderson's assistant on the Sunday strip was Don Trachte. His assistant on the dailies was John Liney. In 1942, arthritis kept Anderson away from the drawing board and Trachte enlisted for WWII, so Anderson turned both the daily and Sunday strip over to Liney. When Trachte returned in 1945, Liney continued to draw the dailies, and Trachte drew the Sunday strips. Liney retired in 1979, but Trachte continued with the Sunday strips until the end of the run in 2005. After Liney's retirement, Jack Tippit took over the dailies until 1983. Dick Hodgins, Jr. worked on the dailies from 1983 until 1995, when the daily strip concluded. About 75 newspapers still ran classic Henry strips. These were also available through King Features' Comics Kingdom. Characters and story Cartoonist Art Baxter analyzed the appeal of the character and the strip: :Henry was a strip that was supposed to be contemporary, but it never looked that way. There were almost no modern trappings. There may be cars or telephones, but that's about it. It always seemed like Henry could always find the coal wagon, horse-drawn ice delivery or a five-cent ice cream cone. There were always shadings of nostalgia in the strip, even when it began in the Depression. Part of that has to do with the fact that Henry's creator, Carl Anderson, was already an old man in his late sixties when he created the character by accident. Henry is autonomous in The Saturday Evening Post strips. Henry would not pick up a regular cast of characters, all with no proper names, only titles: the mother, the dog, the bully, the little girl, until it became a William Randolph Hearst comic strip. The Saturday Evening Post Henry is similar in many ways to the Little Rascals/Our Gang comedies of the same era. That is children free from the tyranny of an adult presence (mostly): children navigating the world as best they can with the knowledge and experience they currently possess; sometimes getting things right, often getting things wrong, and frequently coming up with solutions to problems unique to their limited experience. Necessity is the mother of invention with funny, surprising results. Later strips of Henry would be somewhat a reversal of earlier themes, such as adults having the last word when Henry and his friends misbehave, or Henry walking around town to see free samples of common household items, then seeing another sign advertising ice cream for expensive prices, to his unspoken consternation. John Liney's Henry (March 30, 1973) Derivative works Henry appears (and speaks) alongside Betty Boop in the Fleischer Studios animated short Betty Boop with Henry, the Funniest Living American (1935). During the period of 1946 to 1961, Dell Comics published 61 issues of a color comic book titled Carl Anderson's Henry. Henry spoke in the comic book, as did the other principal characters.

Superbit DVDs aimed to improve picture quality over a standard DVD edition of a feature by increasing the bit rate of the encoded video. Audio quality was also improved by the mandatory inclusion of both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 surround audio tracks. Technical details Superbit discs can be read by all regular DVD video players, but their film files were encoded at a bit rate that is, according to Sony, approximately 1.5 times as high (6-7 Mbit/s vs 4-5 Mbit/s) as that of standard DVDs, which helps minimize artifacts caused by video compression and allow the image to be pre-filtered less prior to compression, which results in more detail. Superbit should not be confused with either Blu-ray or HD DVD discs, both of which are different media formats of much higher bit rate and resolution, and are incompatible with standard DVD video players. To maximize space for the main feature, static menus are used and commentary tracks are removed. To further improve the size and therefore quality of the film on the disc, Superbit discs contained a reduced amount (and usually are completely devoid) of bonus material, such as documentaries or interviews, which can be found on regular DVDs. All Superbit releases present a film in its theatrical aspect ratio. History The Superbit line launched in October 2001 with five titles: The Fifth Element, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Air Force One, Desperado and Johnny Mnemonic. Following the initial release of the Superbit line, Superbit Deluxe was introduced, which bundled a Superbit-quality feature with a second disc containing the special features. In January 2007, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment discontinued its Superbit line in order to promote its Blu-ray Disc format. In its lifetime, Superbit DVDs failed to break into the mainstream home media consumer base: industry sources indicate that at its peak, Superbit titles typically sold only 2% of the title's regular DVD version.

It was directed by Jack Conway and stars Jean Harlow as a woman who uses sex to advance her social position. During the course of the film, Harlow's character breaks up a marriage, has multiple affairs, premarital sex, and attempts to kill a man. Plot Lillian \\"Lil\\" Andrews (Jean Harlow) is a young woman, living in Ohio, who will do anything to improve herself. She seduces her wealthy boss William \\"Bill\\" Legendre Jr. (Chester Morris) and cleverly breaks up his marriage with his loving wife Irene (Leila Hyams). Irene reconsiders and tries to reconcile with Bill, only to find he has married Lil the previous day. However, Lil finds herself shunned by high society, including Bill's father, Will Legendre, Sr. (Lewis Stone), because of her lower-class origins and homewrecking. When Charles B. Gaerste (Henry Stephenson), a nationally known coal tycoon and the main customer of the Legendre's company, visits the city, Lil thinks she has found a way to force her way into the highest social circles. She seduces Charles, then blackmails him into throwing a party at her mansion, knowing that no one would dare offend him by not showing up. It seems like a social coup for Lil, until her hairdresser friend and confidante Sally (Una Merkel) points out that all the guests have left early to attend a surprise party for Irene (who lives across the street). Charles Boyer as Albert and Jean Harlow as Lillian Humiliated, she decides to move to New York City, even if it means a temporary separation from her husband. Will Sr. finds Lil's handkerchief at Gaerste's place and correctly guesses what Lil has done. He shows his evidence to his son, who hires detectives to watch Lil. They find that she is conducting not one, but two affairs, with Charles and his handsome French chauffeur Albert (Charles Boyer). Bill shows Charles damning photographs. When Lil learns that Charles has found out about her, she returns to Bill, only to find him with Irene. Furious, she shoots him, but he survives and refuses to have her charged with attempted murder. However, he does divorce her, and remarries Irene. Two years later, he sees her again, at a racetrack in Paris, in the company of an aged Frenchman. He discreetly hides Irene's binoculars. In the final scene, Lil and her elderly companion get into a limousine driven by Albert.

F. Scott Fitzgerald and Marcel de Sano were originally hired to collaborate on creating a script adapted from Katherine Brush's 1931 novel. Fitzgerald initially turned down MGM's offer as their offer of $750 per week was not satisfactory; producer Irving Thalberg, however, raised the sum to $1,200 since he wanted Fitzgerald's name on the project. Fitzgerald then objected to working with de Sano, insisting that he work alone, but he was forced to comply. The two quickly experienced a falling out, but still finished the script in five weeks. Despite all this effort, however, Thalberg was concerned that the original story and the first draft of a script by Fitzgerald and de Sano was too serious, and offered the job of rewriting it to Anita Loos, instructing her to provide something that was more fun and playful and with a greater emphasis on comedy. MGM then hired Anita Loos, who completed rough and revised drafts of the script between January and February 1932. (Both scripts are currently owned by Yale University at The Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library.) Red-Headed Woman was filmed at MGM Studios in Culver City, California. MGM's \\"English House\\" and \\"New York Street\\" backlots ‚Äì both located in Lot 2 ‚Äì were primary filming locations for the production. Before casting Harlow, MGM considered casting Clara Bow as Lillian Andrews, who originally agreed to take the part but objected to the \\"future services\\" option demanded by the studio.The Evening Independent, February 18, 1932 Screenland (June 1932) (pg.60) also noted that Colleen Moore was considered for the part. In its April 12, 1932 issues, however, Motion Picture magazine (pg.11) reported seeing Jean Harlow at the premiere of the film Grand Hotel sporting red, \\"titian hair\\", suggesting she was involved in the production. The \\"Modern Screen\\" gossip column in The Hollywood Times confirmed these suspicions in May 1932 stating: \\"Guess who is going to be MGM's 'Red-Headed Woman'? No other than that famous platinum blonde, Jean Harlow. They will either have to get a new title for the picture, or a very large bottle of very extra red henna for Jean's crowning glory.\\" The opening scene of the film shows Harlow's character getting her hair dyed red. The film's first line of dialogue is \\"So Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Hah.\\" The film, in fact, was Jean Harlow's first film after having left Hollywood for a few months following a fall-out with Howard Hughes, as reported by Screenland.Screenland, September 1932, p. 92 Although uncredited, Jean Harlow's husband Paul Bern was the film's production supervisor. Prior to the film's release, producer Thalberg worked with the Will Hays Office to shore up the censor's approval. Of particular concern were several scenes in which Harlow was partially undressed or making obvious sexual advances. Thalberg eventually agreed to seventeen cuts. Despite this fact, the film still received a number of complaints from cinema patrons. Reception Critical response to Red-Headed Woman was overwhelmingly positive. McCarthy of the Motion Picture Herald wrote: \\"Sexy, racy, bristling with snappy dialogue, funny, [Red-Headed Woman] is loaded with dynamite that can be dynamic entertainment, or an explosion of objections unless you handle it properly and with all the finesse and ability that your showmanship experience commands.\\" The September 1932 edition of Screenland also gave the film a glowing review, writing: \\"The film [Red-Headed Woman] follows Katherine Brush's novel with satirical improvements by Anita Loos, who, fed up with blondes, gives red-headed women their due... See this for sheer amusement. Jean plays a mean part so cleverly that you can't help liking this wild red-headed woman.\\" Along with this review, Screenland chose Red- Headed Woman as one of the six best pictures of the month and named Harlow's performance \\"one of the ten best portrayals of the month.\\" (September 1932, pp. 356‚Äì357). Red-Headed Woman opened in France as La Belle Aux Cheveux Roux and in Spain as La Pelirroja. Z√°rraga, a reporter for Cine-Mundial, (September 1932, p. 585), a Spanish-language magazine, wrote: \\"Red-Headed Woman was predestined to triumph. Step-by-step [Harlow] succeeded, and the secret of her success was not precisely in her statuary beauty, nor in her famous platinum- colored hair: it was, above all, in her disturbing way of kissing...\\" The film was banned in the United Kingdom.Red Headed Woman, BBFC (1933) rejection page References External links  Category:1932 films Category:1932 romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Jack Conway Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Films with screenplays by Anita Loos Category:1932 comedy films ","title":"Red-Headed Woman"},{"id":"1141362","text":"Dreamlin is an electronic music group from Belarus. Dreamlin, hailing from Minsk, Belarus started when Denis ¬´C4¬ª Korabkov, who used to play guitar with a local cult, psychedelic reggae band at the time met Egor Kunovsky, who had long been involved with music software and computers. In 2000, they teamed together as Dreamlin and had their music used in several underground films and videos worldwide as well hitting the #1 artist spot at Ampcast.com in summer 2001. In 2002 they started playing to live crowds and soon became the most requested electronic act in the country. Their constant love to mixing electronic and live instruments brought on stage a vocalist and several other people who played guitars, drums and electronic drums, flute and all kinds of percussion. By 2004 Egor plays most of the gigs together with multyinstrumentalist Andrey Karpovich (Andre Karp), while Denis prefers studio work, now not only with Dreamlin project. Collaborative tracks do not include just local live musicians; the geography of people who worked with Dreamlin spreads from Finland to Hawaii. The style of the music that Dreamlin produces is not limited to a genre or two. No matter that on most flyers Dreamlin is listed as downtempo, you can hear almost any kind of electronic music except trance in their sets. All kinds of broken beats are preferred, but some mellow chill-out house tune is also quite likely to be heard. The first album, The Colour Of The City was released in 2004 in Belarus, in 2005 in Russia and 2006 saw it available on digital download sites worldwide. It was later removed from sale as Collaps closed and re-released again in 2013. In 2006 Dreamlin was first invited to play a gig outside of ex-USSR and later was listed at the biggest open-air event in Belarus, which takes place yearly at Borovaya aero- club near Minsk. In 2007 Andrey has left the country and returned only in 2009 when the band finally started to make songs with Andrey's vocals. The second standalone release of music by Dreamlin is the Monday Islands EP released in 2008 as digital download. \\"Let's\\" EP was released in 2011 and featured music that would be most likely interesting to Russian-speaking audience.

(6 March 1881 ‚Äì 27 August 1966), was a writer and translator of Russian-Jewish background who spent his later life in exile. Early life Cournos was born in Zhitomir, Russian Empire, and his first language was Yiddish; he studied Russian, German and Hebrew, with a tutor at home.Smith, \\"Aleksei Remizov's English-language Translators,\\" p. 190. When he was ten years old his family emigrated to Philadelphia, where he learned English. Literary career In June 1912, he moved to London, where he freelanced as an interviewer and critic for both UK and US publications and began his literary career as a poet and, later, novelist. He later emigrated to the US, where he spent the rest of his life. He was one of the Imagist poets, but is better known for his novels, short stories, essays and criticism, and as a translator of Russian literature. He used the pseudonym John Courtney. He also wrote for The Philadelphia Record under the pseudonym \\"Gorky.\\" Later in life he married Helen Kestner Satterthwaite (1893‚Äì1960), who was also an author, under the pseudonyms Sybil Norton and John Hawk. However, he is probably best known for his unhappy affair with Dorothy L. Sayers, fictionalised by Sayers in the detective book Strong Poison (1930) and by Cournos himself in The Devil Is an English Gentleman (1932). Anti- communism In the aftermath of the October Revolution Cournos was involved with a London-based anti-Communist organisation, the Russian Liberation Committee. On its behalf, he wrote in 1919 a propaganda pamphlet, London under the Bolsheviks: A Londoner's Dream on Returning from Petrograd, based largely on what he saw during his 1917‚Äì1918 visit to Aleksey Remizov in Petrograd, whose Chasy he was then translating as The Clock.Smith, \\"Aleksei Remizov's English-language Translators,\\" pp. 191‚Äì92. It closely follows the early events of the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, and it was set in Britain to better enable the British audience to imagine what it was like. Sinclair Lewis used the same device to imagine a Fascist takeover in the United States in his 1935 work It Can't Happen Here. In Cournos' lurid but humorous future history, a British revolutionary regime introduces a new currency named \\"The MacDonald\\" for Ramsay MacDonald;, who is, however, soon shoved aside by the Bolshevik leaders MacLenin and Trotsman (sic). A counter-revolutionary drive by General Haig is defeated at St Albans, and the Bolsheviks start rounding up their former allies. Lloyd George is imprisoned in the Tower of London. H.G. Wells, too, is imprisoned by the Bolsheviks, despite his left-leaning book Love and Mr Lewisham. London is portrayed as plagued by poverty, with black market cigarettes and broken lifts, and the narrator wanders round the Strand exclaiming at the filth of the streets, the idlers and the jealous envy towards his new boots. Death Cournos died in New York City.

It created a series of video codecs called TrueMotion (including TrueMotion S, TrueMotion 2, TrueMotion RT 2.0, TrueMotion VP3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). In February 2010, On2 Technologies was acquired by Google for an estimated $124.6 million. On2's VP8 technology became the core of Google's WebM video file format.  History  While known by the name The Duck Corporation, they developed TrueMotion S, a codec that was used by some games for full motion video (FMV) sequences during the 1990s. The original office of the Duck Corporation was founded in New York City by Daniel B. Miller, Victor Yurkovsky, and Stan Marder. In 1994 Duck opened its first \\"satellite\\" engineering office in Colonie, NY under the management of Eric Ameres. Miller became CEO of newly renamed On2 Technologies until Doug McIntyre was hired in late 2000, when Miller resumed his role as CTO. CEO's after McIntyre included Bill Joll and Matt Frost. After Miller's departure in 2003, newly promoted CTO Eric Ameres moved the primary engineering office to upstate NY's capital region. Ameres later departed in 2007 to pursue other research as part of the opening of the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) at his alma mater, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). After Ameres' departure in 2007 Paul Wilkins served as co-CTO with Jim Bankoski. Wilkins was founder of \\"Metavisual\\" which was acquired by On2 in 1999 to bring the VP3 codec to market. The VP3 codec became the basis of On2's future codecs as well as the basis of the open source Theora video codec. In 1995, The Duck Corporation raised $1.5 million in venture funding from Edelson Technology Partners. In 1997, they raised an additional $5.5 million in a venture round primarily financed by Citigroup Ventures. In 1999, The Duck Corporation merged with Applied Capital Funding, Inc., a public company on the American Stock Exchange. The merged entity was first renamed On2.Com and then On2 Technologies, trading on the AMEX as ONT. ONT's price peaked at a little over $40 per share, briefly giving the company a market cap in excess of $1 billion. On April 4, 2000, On2 buys Quickband, Inc. (\\"Quickband\\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired substantially all of the assets of DVD Mags, Inc. (\\"DVD Mags\\"), a California corporation in the business of aggregating and producing short-form entertainment content for distribution across digital and traditional channels (the \\"Quickband Acquisition\\"). The Quickband Acquisition was effected pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (\\"Purchase Agreement\\") dated as of March 9, 2000 by and among the Company, Quickband and DVD Mags. On November 3, 2000, On2 acquired the game engine development company Eight Cylinders Studios. In May 2007, On2 announced an agreement to acquire Finnish Hantro Products, a provider of video codecs for chips for wireless devices. The acquisition was finalized on November 1, 2007.On2 company information page In November 2008, On2 announced that it would partner with Zencoder to create Flix Cloud, a high-capacity online video encoding service using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).On2 Technologies and Zencoder Partner to Create On-Demand Video Encoding Service Flix Cloud launched in April 2009.On2 Technologies Releases On2 Flix Cloud On-Demand Video Transcoding Service = Acquisition by Google = On 5 August 2009, Google offered to acquire On2 Technologies for $106.5 million in Google stock.

On 19 February 2010, the transaction was completed, valued at approximately $124.6 million. After this purchase, the following message was posted on the on2.com website: \\"The On2 products Flix Pro, Flix Standard, Flix Exporter, Flix PowerPlayers, Flix Live, Flix DirectShow SDK, Flix Publisher and Flix Engine are no longer for sale.\\" Technology =TrueMotion S= According to the company itself, development started in the early 1990s. The first versions of the codec were mainly targeted at and used for full motion video scenes in computer games. One of the codec's competitive advantages in this field was that, unlike MPEG, it does not require a separate decoder, thus reducing costs to game publishers. At the time, MPEG's dominance was nearly secured, especially with hardware-implementations of the codec, meant to run on special hardware boards only. This was the first version in the TrueMotion series of proprietary lossy video compression formats and video codec. This format compressed frame in either a 32-bit or 16-bit RGB color space with a FourCC of \`DUCK\` (or \`TMOT\` for a version of TrueMotion S that was licensed by Horizon Technologies). It is usually put in an AVI container. The filename extension varies from game to game. Some leave it with \`.avi\`, other games use \`.bin\` or \`.duc\`. Gaming consoles which were licensed to use the codec include the Sega Saturn, Sega 32X, and 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. Simon & Schuster first person games such as Star Trek: Borg also used the compression format. Some of the files can be played back with a video player that uses the libavcodec library, such as MPlayer. In 1995, Horizons Technology Inc. began shipping the TrueMotion-S Compressor software for Macintosh and MS Windows. TrueMotion-S was originally developed by the Duck Corp. for applications such as the Sega game box. In 1996, the main competitors for TrueMotion S software codec were Cinepak and Indeo in games for first-generation CD-ROM based game consoles. =TrueMotion RT= The ‚Äúreal time‚Äù version in the series was released in 1996. It was meant for real time capturing and processing of digital video. =TrueMotion 2= The second version in this series only supported a 24-bit RGB color space optimized for Windows rendering which orders components as BGR with a FourCC of TM20. Used for Final Fantasy VII and Star Trek: Klingon. In 1997, Microsoft Corp. licensed The Duck Corp.'s TrueMotion 2.0 video codec technology to bring TV-quality video to the PC platform.Microsoft Corp.

The third version in the series switched to using a planar Y'CbCr 4:2:0 color space. In late 2001, On2 released their VP3(.2) compression technology into the open-source community including their patents on the technology. The technology lives on in the form of Theora. The Xiph.Org Foundation created its codec Theora as a fork of the codebase of VP3.2. The forked version added 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 sub sampling for better color quality options. In April 2001 VP4 was published, which brought an improved encoder for the same bitstream format. = TrueMotion VP5/6 = A preview version of VP5 was published on February 21, 2002 with production version being available as of May 1, 2002.On2 (2002-02-21) On2 Releases Preview Version Of VP5, The World's Most Powerful Video Compression Technology , Retrieved on 2009-08-16CNet (2002-02-22) On2: Move over, MPEG-4, Retrieved on 2009-08-16StreamingMedia.com (2002-02-27) On2 Previews VP5, Retrieved on 2009-08-16 The production version of VP5 codec was released in May 2002.On2 (2002-05-01) On2 Technologies Releases Production Version Of VP5 & TrueCast 7.2 , Retrieved on 2009-08-16 When the codec was in beta, to preview its quality, On2 created a plug-in for RealPlayer.

On May 12, 2003 On2 announced the release of VP6. Revised versions 6.1 and 6.2 followed later that year. Since October 2003 it may be used free of charge for personal use. In late 2003, On2 announced that its VP5 and VP6 codecs were selected by Beijing E-World as a video coding method to be used in a Chinese-developed competitor to the DVD format called the EVD (Enhanced Versatile Disc) format. Then in April 2004, On2 announced that its business relationship with E-World had soured, and that On2 would file multiple breach of contract claims against E-World in arbitration proceedings. The arbitrator reached a conclusion on March 10, 2005, according to SEC filings by On2 on March 14, 2005. The arbitrator dismissed each of On2's claims and ruled that E-World owed nothing to On2 and had not breached the contract. It seems unlikely that On2 will ultimately get any significant payback from the EVD initiative, although some contract relationship remains in effect. A number of less highly visible deals with other customers and partners seem to have worked out more amicably than the Chinese DVD project. Recent announcements have related to deals with Apex Datacom, IWAPI Inc., Vividas, Digital Witness, XM Satellite Radio, PowerLinx, and LeapFrog Enterprises. In particular, the company indicated that it expected to recognize some revenue from the Leapfrog deal in the third quarter of 2005 and also made optimistic statements about the future with XM Satellite Radio. In 2004, On2's VP6 was selected for use as the Macromedia Flash Video 8 codec. This apparently stems from a deal made in the second quarter of 2004 with revenue in that quarter of $1.4 million for the licensing agreement. In related news, On2 announced on April 5, 2005 that it had acquired the Flix Flash video encoder technology from Wildform, Inc. On2 added support for Flash 8 video output to the Flix 8 product line that they released on September 13, 2005. = TrueMotion VP7 = The seventh version changed the bitstream from previous versions for better coding efficiency and was released in March 2005; since July it may be used free of charge for personal use. It is a codec with both VFW and DirectShow support that On2 Technologies claims has better compression than leading competitive codecs such as MPEG-4 AVC (H.264) and VC-1. On2 Technologies announced TrueMotion VP7 in January 2005. The public release of VP7 codec software was available in March 2005. On March 9, 2005, On2 announced a new codec, VP7. On2 claimed that VP7 is superior to the H.264/AVC standard, based on claims of comparative technical capabilities and licensing costs. This claim has been disputed by a developer of x264, a popular H.264 encoder. In April 2005, On2 Technologies licensed On2 Video Codecs (including VP6 and VP7) for Macromedia Flash. On December 1, 2005, Skype announced that they had licensed current and future versions of its video compression software and had integrated it into the Beta version of Skype 2.0 for point-to-point video conferencing Skype protocol. No financial terms were disclosed relating to the deal. On August 13, 2007, On2 announced the addition of H.264 support to its On2 Flix product line.About Move Networks also used the VP7 codec in its Move Media Player plugin for Firefox and Internet Explorer, used by ABC and Fox for its streaming of full network shows. = TrueMotion VP8 = VP8 was published in 2008 and marked the transfer of formats to Google with their acquisition of On2 and was Open Sourced on May 19, 2010. The VP8 codec was licensed under a BSD license.

Odessa ghetto marked with gold-red star. Transnistria massacres marked with red skulls. The Odessa massacre was the mass murder of the Jewish population of Odessa and surrounding towns in the Transnistria Governorate during the autumn of 1941 and the winter of 1942 while it was under Romanian control. Depending on the accepted terms of reference and scope, the Odessa massacre refers either to the events of October 22‚Äì24, 1941 in which some 25,000 to 34,000 Jews were shot or burned, or to the murder of well over 100,000 Ukrainian Jews in the town and the areas between the Dniester and Bug rivers, during the Romanian and German occupation. The primary perpetrators were Romanian soldiers, Einsatzgruppe SS and local ethnic Germans. Before the massacre Before the war, Odessa had a large Jewish population of approximately 200,000, or 30% of the city's total population. By the time the Romanians had taken the city, between 80,000 and 90,000 Jews remained, the rest having fled or been evacuated by the Soviets. As the massacres occurred, Jews from surrounding villages were concentrated in Odessa and Romanian concentration camps set up in the surrounding areas. On October 16, following a two-month siege, the Germans and Romanians captured Odessa. Mass killings of hostages and Jews on October 22‚Äì24 Plaque on the wall of the Odessa-Sortuvalna railway station, commemorating the Holocaust = Destruction of the Romanian commandant's office = On October 22, 1941, in the building of the NKVD on the Marazlievskaya street where the Romanian military commander's office and the headquarters of the Romanian 10th Infantry Division had settled to occupy the city, a radio-controlled mine exploded. The mine had been planted there by the sappers of the Red Army even before the surrender of the city by Soviet troops. The building collapsed, and under its rubble, 67 people were killed, including 16 officers, among whom was the military commander of the city, Romanian General Ioan Glogojeanu. Responsibility for the explosion was placed on the Jews and Communists. = The execution of hostages = In response to the explosion at the commandant's office, the Romanian troops and the German \\"Einsatzgruppe\\" arrived in Odessa on October 23 to kill from 5,000 to 10,000 hostages, many of whom were Jews. Across the Marazlievskaya street, occupiers broke into the apartments of Odessa citizens and shot or hanged all residents found, without exception. They raided the streets and markets of the city and suburbs, and people who knew nothing of the bombing were shot on site against fences or the walls of houses. Nearly 100 men were seized and shot at the Big Fountain, about two hundred people were hanged in the Slobodka neighborhood near the market, 251 residents were executed in Moldavanka, Near and Far Windmills and in Aleksandrovsky Prospekt about 400 townspeople were hanged. The columns of the captured hostages were driven to the area of artillery warehouses on Lustdorf Road, where they were shot or burned alive. After the war, more than 22,000 corpses were found in mass graves. = The beginning of the Holocaust = On October 23, an order was issued threatening all Jews with death on the spot and ordering them to report to the village of Dalnik on October 24. In the afternoon of October 24, about 5,000 Jews were gathered near the outpost of Dalnik. The first 50 people were brought to the anti-tank ditch and shot by the commander of the 10th machine-gun battalion, Lieutenant-Colonel Nicolae Deleanu. To speed up the process of destruction, the Jews were driven into four barracks, in which holes were made for machine guns, and the floor was pre-filled with gasoline. People in two barracks were shot with machine guns on the same day. At 17:00 the barracks were set on fire. The next day, the prisoners were shot, placed in the remaining two barracks, and in one of the barracks grenades were thrown. Meanwhile, the Jews who were not selected for the first group, and who had already arrived in Dalnik, were told that they were \\"forgiven\\". They were sent to various military headquarters and Gendarmerie stations for \\"registration\\", where they were detained for different lengths of time. When they were released, they discovered that their houses had been occupied and their property plundered. During the first week of stay of Romanians in Odessa, the city lost about 10% of its inhabitants.  Subsequent events  Aftermath of the Odessa Massacre: Jewish deportees killed outside Brizula (now Podilsk). The registration carried out the Romanian administration in late 1941 counted about 60,000 Jews in Odessa. This number included persons having only one Jewish ancestor. Jews were required to wear a special distinctive badge, a yellow hexagon (Magen David, the Star of David, a symbol of Judaism) on a black background. On November 7, 1941, an order was issued, making it mandatory for all male Jews from 18 to 50 years old to report to the city prison. From that day on, the entire Jewish population of the city was sent to concentration camps, organized by Romanians in the countryside, primarily to the village of Bogdanovka (now in the Mykolayiv region). Later, a ghetto was arranged in Odessa itself. The Romanian administration took measures to seize the property of future victims. In mid- November, a new order was issued clarifying the authorities' demands for Jews. It said: By the middle of December, about 55,000 Jews were gathered in Bogdanovka, though some of them were not from Odessa. From December 20, 1941 until January 15, 1942, each of them was shot by a team of the Einsatzgruppe SS, Romanian soldiers, Ukrainian police and local German colonists. A month later, a death march of 10,000 Jews was organized in three concentration camps in Golta. In January 1942, about 35,000-40,000 of the Jews left in Odessa were evicted and sent to the ghetto that had been created on January 10, 1942 in the poor area of Slobodka. The evicted endured terrible conditions; with inadequate housing for all and severe crowding, many were forced out into the open winter air, which led to mass mortality from hypothermia. From January 12 to February 20, 1942, the remaining 19,582 Jews were deported to the Bereza district of the Odessa region. They were transported in unheated echelons, and many died on the road. In Berezovka, groups were forced to walk to Domanevka, Bogdanovka, Golta and other concentration camps. Many died of hunger and cold along the way. The guards, consisting of Romanian soldiers and German colonists, organized mass executions of Jews during the journeys. In 18 months, almost all the prisoners of Golta died.  The survivors of the Holocaust  Some Jews were sent to work in the villages, and about half of them survived the occupation. The situation in the ghetto of Domanevka and other ghettos in Transnistria improved in 1943 after the Jews began to receive assistance from Jewish organizations in Romania. About 600 Odessa residents in these ghettos lived to be released. Several hundred Jews who were hiding in Odessa itself also survived. Jews participated in the struggle of the Odessa underground and constituted a significant part of the guerrilla units, based in the Odessa catacombs.  Trials and punishment of the main perpetrators  At the Bucharest People's Tribunal, set up in 1946 by the new Romanian government in conjunction with the Allied Control Council, one of the charges brought against Marshal Ion Antonescu, the Governor of Transnistria Gheorghe Alexianu and the commander of the Odessa garrison, General Nicolae Macici, was \\"the organization of repressions against the civilian population of Odessa autumn of 1941\\". For these crimes, they were sentenced to death. The first two were shot on July 1, 1946. Later, King Michael commuted the death penalty sentence to life imprisonment for General Macici. In response to the appeal of the verdict filed by the son of Alexianu, on November 5, 2006, Bucharest Court of Appeal confirmed the verdict of war criminals to death, dated May 17, 1946. In response to the appeal filed by the Prosecutor General, on May 6, 2008 the case was re-examined and the judges of the High Court of Cassation and Justice finally rejected the application for revision of the 1946 sentence.  Perpetuation of memory  = Memorial in Prokhorovsky square = In the early 1990s in Prokhorovsky Square in Odessa, the very place where the \\"road of death\\" to the extermination camps for Odessa's Jews and Gypsies began on the outskirts of the city in 1941, a memorial commemorating the victims of the Holocaust was created. A memorial sign was installed, along with the \\"Alley of the Righteous Among the World\\", featuring trees planted in honor of each Odessa citizen who had harbored and saved the Jews. The complex was completed in 2004 with the erection of a monument to the victims of the Holocaust in Odessa by sculptor Zurab Tsereteli.

The opening of the museum took place on June 22, 2009. = Other = In January 2015, the authorities of the Italian town of Cheriano-Lagetto, in the province of Monza-e-Brianza in the Lombardy region, named a city square \\"Martyrs Square of Odessa\\" in memory of the victims of the occupation regimes in Odessa: Jews killed October 22‚Äì24, 1941, as well as anti-Maidan activists, rescuers and accidental victims who died on May 2, 2014 in the Odessa Trade Union House during the political crisis in Ukraine. On May 2, 2015, the first anniversary of the events in the House of Trade Unions, a commemorative monument dedicated to the \\"Martyrs of Odessa\\" was opened at this square. The monument is a tongue of flame with a silhouette of a dove, a symbol of the world, inside. The 2018 tragicomic Romanian film I Do Not Care If We Go Down in History as Barbarians deals with the massacre and historical memory among modern Romanians.

Some of the leading founders of this movement were Mendele Moykher-Sforim (1836‚Äì1917), I. L. Peretz (1852‚Äì1915), and Sholem Aleichem (1859‚Äì1916). Origins In 1861, Yehoshua Mordechai Lifshitz (1828‚Äì1878), who is considered the father of Yiddishism and Yiddish lexicography, circulated an essay entitled ‚ÄúThe Four Classes‚Äù (Yiddish: di fir klasn ◊ì◊ô ◊§◊ô◊® ◊ß◊ú◊ê◊°◊ü) in which he referred to Yiddish as a completely separate language from both German and Hebrew and, in the European context of his audience, the \\"mother tongue\\" of the Jewish people. In this essay, which was eventually published in 1863 in an early issue of the influential Yiddish periodical Kol Mevasser, he contended that the refinement and development of Yiddish were indispensable for the humanization and education of Jews. In a subsequent essay published in the same periodical, he also proposed Yiddish as a bridge linking Jewish and European cultures. Scholar Mordkhe Schaechter characterizes Lifshitz as \\"[t]he first conscious, goal-oriented language reformer\\" in the field of Yiddish, and highlights his pivotal role in countering the negative attitudes toward the language propagated within the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment movement: > Although an adherent of the Enlightenment, [Lifshitz] broke with its sterile > anti-Yiddish philosophy, to become an early ideologue of Yiddishism and of > Yiddish-language planning. He courageously stood up for the denigrated folk > tongue, calling for its elevation and cultivation. He did this in the form > of articles in the weekly Kol-mevaser (in the 1860s) and in his excellent > Russian-Yiddish and Yiddish-Russian dictionaries [...].Schaechter, Mordkhe. > \\"Yiddish language modernization and lexical elaboration\\", in : Language > Reform: History and Future, ed. by Istvan Fodor, Vol. III, Hamburg, 1984, > pp. 195-196. The Czernowitz Conference Hersch Dovid Nomberg, Chaim Zhitlovsky, Scholem Asch, Isaac Leib Peretz, Abraham Reisen during the Czernowitz-Conference; widely publicized post card. From 30 August to 3 September 1908, \\"The Conference for the Yiddish Language\\", also known as \\"The Czernowitz Conference\\" (Yiddish ◊ß◊ê÷∏◊†◊§÷ø◊¢◊®◊¢◊†◊• ◊§÷ø◊ê÷∏◊® ◊ì◊¢◊® ◊ô◊ô÷¥◊ì◊ô◊©◊¢◊® ◊©◊§÷º◊®◊ê÷∑◊ö, or ◊ò◊©◊¢◊®◊†◊ê÷∏◊ï◊ï◊ô◊¶◊¢◊® ◊ß◊ê÷∏◊†◊§÷ø◊¢◊®◊¢◊†◊•, Konferents for der Yidisher Shprakh, or Tshernovitser Konferents), took place in the Austro-Hungarian city of Czernowitz, Bukovina (today in southwestern Ukraine). The conference proclaimed Yiddish a modern language with a developing high culture. The organizers of this gathering (Benno Straucher, Nathan Birnbaum, Chaim Zhitlowsky, David Pinski, and Jacob Gordin) expressed a sense of urgency to the delegates that Yiddish as a language and as the binding glue of Jews throughout Eastern Europe needed help. They proclaimed that the status of Yiddish reflected the status of the Jewish people. Thus only by saving the language could the Jews as a people be saved from the onslaught of assimilation. The conference for the first time in history declared Yiddish to be \\"a national language of the Jewish people.\\" Further developments The Bund (The General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia; , Algemeyner Yidisher Arbeter Bund in Lite, Poyln un Rusland), a secular Jewish socialist party in the Russian Empire, founded in Vilnius, Poland in 1897 and active through 1920, promoted the use of Yiddish as a Jewish national language, and to some extent opposed the Zionist project of reviving Hebrew. In 1925 YIVO (Yiddish Scientific Institute; : Yidisher Visnshaftlekher Institut) was established in Wilno, Poland (Vilnius, now part of Lithuania). YIVO was initially proposed by Yiddish linguist and writer Nochum Shtif (1879‚Äì1933). He characterized his advocacy of Yiddish as \\"realistic\\" Jewish nationalism, contrasted to the \\"visionary\\" Hebraists and the \\"self-hating\\" assimilationists who adopted Russian or Polish. In the Soviet Union during the 1920s, Yiddish was promoted as the language of the Jewish proletariat. It became one of the official languages in the Ukrainian People's Republic and in some of the Soviet republics, such as the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Galician Soviet Socialist Republic. A public educational system entirely based on the Yiddish language was established and comprised kindergartens, schools, and higher educational institutions. At the same time, Hebrew was considered a bourgeois language and its use was generally discouraged. In 1928, the Soviet Union created the Jewish Autonomous Oblast (, yidishe avtonome gegntIn standard Yiddish: , yidishe oytonome gegnt). Located in the Russian Far East and bordering on China, its administrative center was the town of Birobidzhan. There, the Soviets envisaged setting up a new \\"Soviet Zion\\", where a proletarian Jewish culture could be developed. Yiddish, rather than Hebrew, would be the national language. Although the vast majority of the Yiddish- language cultural institutions in the Soviet Union were closed in the late 1930s, Yiddish continued to maintain a strong presence in some areas. Yiddish translation of Das Kapital, translated by Doctor Jacob Abraham Maryson, published by Maryson's publishing company, the Kropotkin Literatur Gezelshaft, New York, 1917. As many Eastern European Jews began to emigrate to the United States, the movement became very active there, especially in New York City. One aspect of this became known as Yiddish Theatre, and involved authors such as Ben Hecht and Clifford Odets. Another aspect was the huge Yiddish press, exemplified in the United States by Yiddish publications such as the Yiddish newspaper Forverts. Owing in a large part to the efforts of the Yiddishist movement, Yiddish, before World War II, was becoming a major language, spoken by over 11,000,000 people.Jacobs, Neil G. Yiddish: a Linguistic Introduction, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005, . The Holocaust, however, led to a dramatic, sudden decline in the use of Yiddish, as the extensive European Jewish communities, both secular and religious, that used Yiddish in their day-to-day life were largely destroyed. Around 5 million, or 85%, of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, were speakers of Yiddish.Solomo Birnbaum, Grammatik der jiddischen Sprache (4., erg. Aufl., Hamburg: Buske, 1984), p. 3. This, coupled with the revival of the Hebrew language as the national language of Israel, essentially extinguished the dynamic momentum Yiddish had been gaining in the early decades of the 20th century.

Roena was one of the original members of El Gran Combo. He later became the leader of his own band, \\"Roberto Roena y Su Apollo Sound\\", arguably one of the best Latin salsa bands in Puerto Rico. Roena has also been a long-time member of the Fania All Stars, a salsa supergroup that has enjoyed worldwide success since the 1970s.  Early career  Roberto Roena (left) and Puerto Rican Salsa DJ Yun Yun Echevarria at Radio Voz, Carolina, Puerto Rico (1980s) Born in the Dulces Labios neighborhood of Mayag√ºez, Roena took his first steps in the art of dance by staging dance routines with his brother Cuqui at his hometown. When Roberto was nine years old, his family settled in Santurce, where the brothers continued to refine their mambo and cha-cha-ch√° routines, delighting their public in talent contests. This led to their contract of weekly performances on the television program ‚ÄúLa Taberna India‚Äù on WKAQ-TV. During the broadcasts, percussionist Rafael Cortijo saw Roena in action. Roena, aside from being a dancer, was a talented at playing percussion Conga drum. Rafael Cortijo took him under his wing and taught him how to play Bongos later to become the bongo player for his band. He also Played occasional baseball.  Cortijo y Su Combo  When Roberto was 16 years old, Cortijo was in need of a bongo player for a group that he was forming. Visualizing a bongo player that could dance and play the cowbell at the same time, Cortijo recruited Roberto to join his new band, and personally taught Roberto how to play both instruments. The group's name derived from the name of an existing band named \\"El Combo\\" in which many of the original band members had been involved. For seven years, Roena was part of Cortijo‚Äôs group and his Combo, with Ismael Rivera as vocalist. With that lineup, they toured the major stages of the United States, Europe, and South America. It is worth noting that \\"Cortijo y Su Combo\\", mostly made up of black musicians (of Puerto Rican descent), was the first of its kind to succeed in gaining access to the stages where only white artists were performing, within and outside of Puerto Rico.  El Gran Combo  The Combo‚Äôs good fortune ended with the arrest of its star singer, Ismael Rivera, for charges of drug possession. With the absence of ‚ÄúEl Sonero Mayor,‚Äù Cortijo‚Äôs musicians discussed the possibility of remaining together. Some members of the group chose to distance themselves from their imprisoned lead singer, and \\"El Gran Combo\\" was born. Out of gratitude and loyalty to Rafael Cortijo, his mentor, Roena did not join the new Combo immediately. Eventually Cortijo left for New York in search of new musicians, and after nine months, Roberto, who had stayed in Puerto Rico, decided to join \\"El Gran Combo\\" which was then led by pianist Rafael Ithier. El Gran Combo became the new sensation in Latin music, and Roena was part of the group until 1969. Wanting to establish his own salsa orchestra, Roberto formed ‚ÄúLos Megatones‚Äù in 1967, playing Latin Jazz Wednesday nights at a local club. Two years after forming \\"Los Megatones\\", as a result of personal differences with Andy Monta√±ez, one of \\"El Gran Combo's\\" vocalists, Roberto left \\"El Gran Combo\\".  Roberto Roena y su Apollo Sound  In 1969, he went on to form a band by the name of \\"Roberto Roena y Su Apollo Sound\\", arguably one of the best Latin salsa bands in Puerto Rico. Roberto Roena‚Äôs new orchestra was baptized \\"El Apollo Sound\\" because the launch of NASA's Apollo 11 lunar mission coincided with the day of the band‚Äôs first rehearsal. The band eventually recorded hits such as Y Tu Loco Loco, Traicion, Que Se Sepa and Herencia Rumbero. Roberto Roena has also been a long-time member of the Fania All Stars, the showcase group for the Fania Records label, which has enjoyed worldwide success since the 1970s. He recorded his signature song, \\"Coro Miyare\\", with the group; live performances of the song featured Roena playing the bongos and dancing with his uncle, legendary salsa dancer An√≠bal V√°zquez, in a choreographed section that almost always received standing ovations from the audience. Mr. Roena took a giant step in the fusion of salsa with jazz, in the 1970s, by joining forces with African superstar (saxophonist) Manu Dibango of \\"Soul Makossa\\" fame. Even without knowing how to read or write music, and probably because of it, Roena knew how to surround himself with excellent musicians and arrangers. \\"Apollo Sound\\" featured musicians from the ensemble of Tito Puente, \\"Cortijo y Su Combo\\", \\"El Gran Combo\\" and \\"Los Sunsets\\", among others. Some of the well renowned arrangers and composers who nourished his repertoire were Mario Ortiz, Bobby Valent√≠n, Elias Lop√©s, Luis ‚ÄúPerico‚Äù Ortiz and Papo Lucca. With \\"Apollo Sound\\", Roberto introduced a ‚Äúnew‚Äù sound to salsa music by utilizing two trumpets, a trombone and a saxophone, a combination he took from the influence of the wind section of the rock group Blood, Sweat and Tears (in honor of which his band recorded a successful version of ‚ÄúSpinning Wheel‚Äù). Roberto always considered variety as the key to success, leading him to include in his musical repertoire everything from go-go to the romantic, the same in English as in Spanish. Roberto Roena and his Apollo Sound‚Äôs first album produced hits of great impact like ‚ÄúT√∫ loco loco y yo tranquilo,‚Äù ‚ÄúEl escapulario,‚Äù and ‚ÄúEl sordo.‚Äù In fact, it was Apollo Sound who popularized the Bobby Cap√≥ classic, ‚ÄúSo√±ando con Puerto Rico.‚Äù Apollo Sound recorded under the label International Records (a subsidiary of Fania) for a decade, in which they harvested successes like ‚ÄúTraici√≥n,‚Äù ‚ÄúChotorro,‚Äù ‚ÄúMi Desenga√±o,‚Äù ‚ÄúFea,‚Äù ‚ÄúMarejada feliz,‚Äù ‚ÄúCui cui,‚Äù and ‚ÄúEl progreso,‚Äù among others. His popularity on the radio waves came accompanied with tours around the United States and Latin America. Complementing the musicality of the salsa group was always the showmanship inherent in Roberto Roena. Dying his hair in new colors, playing percussion in his underwear and sporting a harness so he could ‚Äúfly‚Äù around the stage of New York City's Madison Square Garden were some of the tricks that he used to stand out among the other groups in vogue. In fact, a noted journalist that followed Apollo Sound once remarked that they were ‚Äúthe first group in Puerto Rico with a system of psychedelic lights and go-go girls.‚Äù Beginning in the 1980s, Roberto Roena and his Apollo Sound experienced a fade in popularity, reflecting a crisis that was sweeping through the salsa movement in general. Nevertheless, Roberto maintained himself by collaborating and recording independently with local groups. In 1990, Roena tried to revive the concept of Apollo Sound. He opened a concert for British rock singer Sting at the Coliseo Roberto Clemente, where he presented his hit salsa version of \\"Every Breath You Take\\" (with an amused Sting watching from the sidelines). In 1994, he celebrated 25 years with his orchestra in a successful concert at the Centro de Bellas Artes in San Juan. This performance was recorded and released, validating his music for a new generation.

The relatively warm and fertilePannonian Basin#Climate and natural resources Carpathian Basin has been settled since around 500,000 years ago. The first known traces belong to the Homo heidelbergensis, with scarce or nonexistent evidence of human presence until the Neanderthals around 100,000 years ago. Anatomically modern humans arrived at the Carpathian Basin before and belonged to the Aurignacian group. Some sources also distinguish a very local culture, the Szeletian culture, but this claim is disputed. Development in the Paleolithic is similar to that of the rest of Europe and findings from both the Aurignacian and the succeeding Gravettian (mammoth hunter) culture can be found as far as France and Spain. The rest of the Stone Age is marked by minimal or not-yet-processed archeological evidence, with the exception of the Linear Pottery culture - the \\"garden type civilization\\" that introduced agriculture to the Carpathian Basin. During the Copper and Bronze Ages, three significant groups were the Baden, the Mak√≥ and the Ottom√°ny (to not be confused with Ottoman Turks) cultures. The major improvement was obviously metalworking, but the Baden culture also brought about cremation and even long-distance trade with remote areas such as the Baltic or Iran flourished during the Mak√≥ and Ottom√°ny periods. Turbulent changes during the late Bronze Age gave an end to the native, relatively advancedOttom√°ny culture#Collapse and legacy civilization and the beginning of the Iron Age saw mass immigration of Indo-European nomads believed to be of ancient Iranian ancestry. However, as the time went on, the Carpathian Basin attracted immigration from all directions: the Halstatt Celts from the West were the first and most influential at around 750 BC, the mysterious Sigynnae around 500 BC, the Pannonians - an Illyrian tribe gave the future Roman province its name while the very East became occupied by other Thracian, Iranian and later Celtic tribes. Before 100 BC, most of the area was occupied by various Celtic or celticized people, such as the successor of the Halstatt culture, the Taurisci, the Boii and the Pannonians. The Roman era in the territory of present-day Hungary begins with several attacks between 156 and 70 BC, but their gradual conquest was interrupted by the Dacian king Burebista, whose kingdom stretched as far as today's Slovakia at its greatest extent. However, the period of Dacian dominance did not last long and by 9 BC the Romans have subjugated the entire area and made it into the Pannonia subprovince of province Illyricum and eventually Pannonia province. Under Roman rule, many contemporary cities such as Budapest, Gy≈ër or Sopron were founded and the population romanized and culture as a whole flourished. Roman emperors sometimes also tolerated other tribes settling in the territory, such as the Iazyges or Vandals. Christianity spread during the fourth century AD, when it became the state religion. In the first years of the Age of Migration, the Carpathian Basin was settled by the Huns who by 430 had established a vast, if short-lived, dominion in Europe centered in the basin. Numerous Germanic tribes lived alongside them such as the Goths, Marcomanni, Quadi or Gepidi, the last of which stayed the longest and whose peoples had been incorporated into the Hunnic Empire. The next wave of migration during the sixth century saw other Germanic tribes, the Lombards and Heruli overpower the Gepidi, only to be ousted by another major nomadic tribe, the Avars. Like the Huns, the Avars established an empire there and posed a significant threat to their neighbours, but were eventually defeated by both neighbouring states and internal strife (around 800). However, Avar population remained quite steady until the Hungarian conquest. The territory became divided between East Francia and First Bulgarian Empire with the northeastern part under Moravian Slavic Principality of Nitra. This state lasted until the arrival of the Magyar tribes, the Hungarian conquest (cca. 860-907). Prehistory = Stone Age = Entrance to the archaeological site of V√©rtessz≈ël≈ës where the occipital bone of \\"Samu\\" was found. The oldest archaeological site which yielded evidence of human presencehuman bones, pebble tools and kitchen refusein the Carpathian Basin was excavated at V√©rtessz≈ël≈ës in Transdanubia in the 1960s. The Middle Pleistocene site was situated in calcareous tuff basins with a diameter of that the nearby warm springs had built. The site at V√©rtessz≈ël≈ës was occupied five times between about 500,000 and 250,000 years ago. The occipital bone of an adult male Homo heidelbergensis, who is now known as \\"Samu\\", and a child's milk tooth were found. Tools of quartzite and silex pebbles collected at the nearby river were also found, as well as a fireplace with hearths made from crushed animal bones, with remains of wild horses, aurochs, bisons, red deer, deer, wolves, bears, and saber-toothed cats. There is a gap in the archaeological record, with no evidence of human presence between about 250,000 to 100,000 years ago. The earliest Middle Palaeolithic sites are dated to the transitory period between the Riss and W√ºrm glacial periods around 100,000 years ago. Remains of skulls show that Neanderthals inhabited northeastern Transdanubia and the B√ºkk Mountains during this period. The Neanderthals who lived in the region of √ârd between around 100,000 and 40,000 BC used quartzite pebbles. They led hunting expeditions as far as the Gerecse Hills for cave bears, wild horses, woolly rhinos and other animals. A Neanderthal community settled near the hot-water springs at Tata around 50,000 BC. They hunted mammoth calves, brown bear, wild horses and reed deer. A flat oval object made from mammoth tooth lamella, similar to the Indigenous Australians' ritual tjurunga, was found at the site. A third group of Neanderthals settled in the caves of the Pilis, V√©rtes and Gerecse Hills. They regularly visited the B√ºkk Mountains and the White Carpathians to collect raw material for their tools. Ibex was the main prey of the Neanderthals of the Middle Palaeolothic sites in the B√ºkk Mountains. In addition to local stone, they used raw material from the White Carpathians and the region of the river Prut. Archaeological research suggest that the Neanderthals disappeared from the northern regions of the Carpathian Basin around 40,000 years ago. Latest research shows that the first communities of anatomically modern humans came to the Carpathian Basin between . Consequently, the cohabitation of the Neanderthals and modern humans in the territory, which was assumed by earlier scholarship, cannot be proved. The Aurignacian group of modern humans who settled in the Ist√°ll√≥sk≈ë Cave primarily used tools made of bones and used the cave as a seasonal camping site during their hunts for chamois, red deer, reindeer and other local animals. Their tools made of stone suggest that they came to the B√ºkk Mountains from the Northern Carpathians and the region of the Prut. According to a scholarly view, a local archaeological culturethe \\"Szeleta culture\\"can be distinguished, which represents a transition between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic and was featured by leaf shaped spearheads from around . However, the existence of a distinct archaeological culture is not unanimously accepted by specialists, because most prehistoric tools from the eponymous Szeleta Cave (in the eastern side of the B√ºkk) are similar to those found in the Upper Palaeolithic sites of Central Europe. Attracted by the rich fauna of the lowlands in the centre of the Carpathian Basin, groups of \\"Gravettian\\" hunters penetrated into the territory from the West about 27,000 years ago. The central grasslands were not covered by ice even at the maximum of the last glaciation (around 20,000 years ago). The new arrivals settled on hilltops along the rivers Hern√°d and Bodrog. They primarily hunted mammoth and elk and used stone blades to work skin, bone, antler and wood. Artistic finds are rare; for instance, a disc with serrated edges, which was made of polished limestone, was found at Bodrogkereszt√∫r. A second wave of \\"Gravettians\\" arrived during the warmer period that began about 20,000 years ago. They primarily made their tools from pebbles, similarly to Lower Palaeolithic communities, but no continuity between the two groups can be detected. The remains of semi-sunken huts were excavated at site on a hilltop near S√°rv√°r where reindeer bones were also found. The site also yielded a perforated (but not decorated) reindeer antler. In addition to permanent settlements, the Gravettian hunters' temporary camps were unearthed in the plains of the J√°szs√°g and around Szeged. About 15,000 years ago, new hunters came to the territory; their best-known settlements were situated in northeastern Transdanubia. A pendant made of wolf tooth, a pair of red deer teeth and similar finds suggest that these hunters wore ornaments. Mesolithic sites are rare, but start to appear after systematic surveys, especially in the J√°szs√°g area (Latin Jazygia) in northern Hungary (J√°szber√©ny I). Neolithic settlement begins with the Cri≈ü K√∂r√∂s culture, carbon-dated to around 6200 BC. The Middle Neolithic sees the Western Linear Pottery culture in Transdanubia and Satu-Mare (Szatmar) and Eastern Linear pottery (called \\"Alf√∂ld Linear Pottery\\" in Hungary) in the East, developing into ≈Ωeliezovce (Slovakia) and Szak√°lh√°t and B√ºkk, respectively. The Late Neolithic Tisza culture is followed by the Eneolithic Tiszapolg√°r and Bodrogkereszt√∫r cultures. =Copper & Bronze Ages= \\"Baden culture\\" (circa 3600 ‚Äì 2800 BCE) was a Copper Age (Chalcolithic) material culture found in Central Europe. In Hungarian and Slovakian sites, cremated human remains were often placed in anthropomorphic urns, whereas in Nitriansky Hr√°dok, a mass grave has been found. The only known cemetery with individual graves was found in an early Baden (\\"Boler√°z phase\\") site is Pilismar√≥t, in Kom√°rom-Esztergom County, which also contained a few examples of goods possibly exported from the Stroke-ornamented ware culture (centred in what is now Poland). The Baden culture is claimed by some scholars to have been an early example of an Indo-European culture in Central Europe. Mak√≥ (a town in modern Csongr√°d County) lends its name to a 3rd millennium BCE material culture (also known as the Mak√≥-Caka or Kosihy-Caka culture) and other archaeological finds from the Copper/Bronze Ages. There are more than 180 registered archaeological sites around Mak√≥, the most important of which are at Kiszombor. The Mak√≥ culture is often regarded as a subset or offshoot of the broader Vuƒçedol culture, centred on Vukovar). While there is no consensus on the cultural affiliations of the Mak√≥ sites, kurgans, buckles, jewelry and equestrian equipment found near Mak√≥ may suggest links to nomads migrating from the Eurasian steppe. And in later phases, these sites contain very large numbers of objects associated with the Sarmatians. The Ottom√°ny culture (also known as the Otomani-F√ºzesabony culture) was a Bronze Age culture (circa 2100‚Äì1600 BC) stretching from eastern Hungary and western Romania to southeast Poland and western Ukraine. Amber exported on prehistoric trade routes from the Baltic is often found at Ottom√°ny sites and the people of this culture appear to have held a central part of the so-called \\"Amber Road\\", which connected the powerful and rising ancient Mediterranean states to the south-eastern Baltic region. =Iron Age= In the Carpathian Basin, the Iron Age commenced around 800 BC, when a new population moved into the territory and took possession of the former population's centers fortified by earthworks. The new population may have consisted of ancient Iranian tribes that had seceded from the federation of the tribes living under the suzerainty of the Cimmerians. They were equestrian nomads and formed the people of the Mez≈ëcs√°t culture who used tools and weapons made of iron. They extended their rule over what are now the Great Hungarian Plain and the eastern parts of Transdanubia. Around 750 BC, people of the Hallstatt culture gradually occupied the western parts of Transdanubia, but the earlier population of the territory also survived and thus the two archaeological cultures existed together for centuries. The people of the Hallstatt culture took over the former population's fortifications (e.g., in Velem, Celld√∂m√∂lk, Tihany) but they also built new ones enclosed with earthworks (e.g., in Sopron). The nobility were buried in chamber tombs covered by earth. Some of their settlements situated along the Amber Road developed into commercial centers. Between 550 and 500 BC, new people settled along the river Tisza and in Transylvania. Their immigration may have been connected either to the military campaigns of king Darius I of Persia (522 BC - 486 BC) on the Balkan Peninsula or to the struggles between the Cimmerians and the Scythians. Those people, who settled down in Transylvania and in the Banat, may be identified with the Agathyrsi (probably an ancient Thracian tribe whose presence on the territory was recorded by Herodotus); while those who lived in what is now the Great Hungarian Plain may be identified with the Sigynnae. The new population introduced the use of the potter's wheel in the Carpathian Basin and they maintained close commercial contacts with the neighboring peoples. The Pannonians (an Illyrian tribe) may have moved to the southern territories of Transdanubia in the course of the 5th century BC. In the 4th century BC, Celtic tribes immigrated to the territories around the river R√°ba and defeated the Illyrian people who had been living there, but the Illyrians managed to assimilate the Celts who adopted their language. In the 290s and 280s BC, the Celtic people who were migrating towards the Balkan Peninsula passed through Transdanubia but some of the tribes settled on the territory. Following 279 BC, the Scordisci (a Celtic tribe), who had been defeated at Delphi, settled at the confluence of the rivers Sava and Danube and they extended their rule over the southern parts of Transdanubia. Around that time, the northern parts of Transdanubia were ruled by the Taurisci (also a Celtic tribe) and by 230 BC, Celtic people (the people of the La T√®ne culture) had occupied gradually the whole territory of the Great Hungarian Plain. Between 150 and 100 BC, a new Celtic tribe, the Boii moved to the Carpathian Basin and they occupied the northern and northeastern parts of the territory (mainly the territory of present Slovakia). Roman era The Romans commenced their military raids against the Carpathian Basin in 156 BC when they attacked the Scordisci living in the Transdanubian region. In 119 BC, they marched against Siscia (today Sisak in Croatia) and strengthened their rule over the future Illyricum province south of the Carpathian Basin. In 88 BC, the Romans defeated the Scordisci whose rule was driven back to the eastern parts of Syrmia, while the Pannonians moved to the northern parts of Transdanubia. When King Mithridates VI of Pontus made plans to attack the Romans by way of the Balkan Peninsula, he referred to the Pannonic tribes, and not to the Scordisci, as masters of the region on his path; it appears, therefore, that around 70‚Äì60 BC, the Pannonic tribes were no longer subjugated. Around 50 BC, the mainly Celtic tribes living on the territory were confronted by Burebista, king of the Dacians (82-44 BC), who began suddenly to expand his domain centered in Transylvania. The sources do not indicate clearly whether Burebista was the original unifier of the Dacian tribes, or whether his efforts at unification built upon the work of his predecessors. Burebista subjugated the Taurisci and the Anarti; in the process, he confronted the Celtic tribal alliance led by the Boii. Burebista's victory over the Celts led not only to the breakup of their tribal alliance, but also to the establishment of Dacian settlements in the southern parts of today's Slovakia. Burebista, however, fell victim to his political enemies and his domain was divided into five, then four parts. The period between 15 BC and 9 AD was characterized by the continuous uprisings of the Pannonians against the emerging power of the Roman Empire. The Romans, however, could strengthen their supremacy over the rebellious tribes and they organised the occupied territory into a new province. =Pannonia province= The Roman Empire subdued the Pannonians, Dacians, Celts and other peoples in this territory. The territory west of the Danube was conquered by the Roman Empire between 35 and 9 BC, and became a province of the Roman Empire under the name of Pannonia. The easternmost parts of present-day Hungary were later (106 AD) organized as the Roman province of Dacia (lasting until 271). The territory between the Danube and the Tisza was inhabited by the Sarmatian Iazyges between the 1st and 4th centuries AD, or even earlier (earliest remains have been dated to 80 BC). The Roman Emperor Trajan officially allowed the Iazyges to settle there as confederates. The remaining territory was in Thracian (Dacian) hands. In addition, the Vandals settled on the upper Tisza in the 2nd half of the 2nd century AD. The four centuries of Roman rule created an advanced and flourishing civilization. Many of the important cities of today's Hungary were founded during this period, such as Aquincum (Budapest), Sopianae (P√©cs), Arrabona (Gy≈ër), Solva (Esztergom), Savaria (Szombathely) and Scarbantia (Sopron). Christianity spread in Pannonia in the 4th century, when it became the Empire's official religion. Migration period Europe in 526 In 375 AD, the nomadic Huns began invading Europe from the eastern steppes, instigating the Great Age of Migrations. In 380, the Huns penetrated into present-day Hungary, and remained an important factor in the region well into the 5th century. Around the same time (379-395), the Roman Empire allowed the groups of Goths, Alans, Huns, Marcomanni and Quadi to settle Pannonia, which still was a Roman territory. The Visigoths, Alans, Vandals and most of the Quadi and Marcomanni, however, left this territory around 400, and moved on to western and southern Europe. The Huns, taking advantage of the departure of the Goths, Quadi, et al., created a significant empire in 423 based in Hungary. In 453 they reached the height of their expansion under the well-known conqueror, Attila the Hun. The empire collapsed in 455, when the Huns were defeated by the neighbouring Germanic tribes (such as the Quadi, Gepidi and Scirii). The Gepidi (having lived to the east of the upper Tisza river since 260 AD) then moved into the eastern Carpathian Basin in 455. They ceased to exist in 567 when they were defeated by the Lombards and Avars (see below). The Germanic Ostrogoths inhabited Pannonia, with Rome's consent, between 456 and 471. =After the Romans= The Avars around 650 Europe around 800 Roman influence in Pannonia had begun to decline as early as the arrival of the Huns in the 4th century. The remaining romanized Pannonians created at the end of the 5th century the Keszthely culture, around the Balaton lake. The first Slavs came to the region, almost certainly from the north, soon after the departure of the Ostrogoths (471 AD), together with the Lombards and Herulis. Around 530, the Germanic Lombards settled in Pannonia. They had to fight against the Gepidi and the Slavs. In 568, pushed out by the Avars, they moved into northern Italy. The nomadic Avars arrived from Asia in the 560s, utterly destroyed the Gepidi in the east, drove away the Lombards in the west, and subjugated the Slavs, partly assimilating them. The Avars, just as the Huns had decades before, established a large empire. This empire was destroyed around 800 by Frankish and Bulgar attacks, and above all by internal feuds, however Avar population remained in numbers until the arrival of √Årp√°d's Magyars. From 800, the whole area of Pannonian Basin was under control between two powers (East Francia and First Bulgarian Empire). Around 800, northeastern Hungary became part of the Slavic Principality of Nitra, which itself became part of Great Moravia in 833. Also, after 800, southeastern Hungary was conquered by Bulgaria. Western Hungary (Pannonia) was a tributary to the Franks. In 839 the Slavic Balaton Principality was founded in southwestern Hungary (under Frank suzerainty). During the reign of Svatopluk I northwestern Hungary was conquered by Great Moravia.Frucht, Richard C. , Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Land and Culture ABC-CLIO Ltd (2004) p288 Pannonia remained under Frankish control until the Hungarian Conquest.T√≥th, S√°ndor L√°szl√≥ (1998).

The supposed small galaxy contains a relatively high percentage of red giants and is thought to contain an estimated one billion stars in all. The Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy is classified as an irregular galaxy and is now thought to be the closest neighboring galaxy to the Earth's location in the Milky Way, being located about away from the Solar System and from the Galactic Center. It has a roughly elliptical shape and is thought to contain as many stars as the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, the previous contender for closest galaxy to our location in the Milky Way. Discovery The existence of a strong elliptical-shaped stellar overdensity was reported in November 2003 by an international team of French, Italian, British and Australian astronomers, who claimed their study pointed to a newly discovered dwarf galaxy: the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy. This structure is located closer to the Sun than the center of our galaxy, at approximately from the Sun. The team of astronomers that discovered it was collaborating on analysis of data from the Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), a comprehensive survey of the sky in infrared light, which is not blocked by gas and dust as severely as visible light. Because of this technique, scientists were able to detect a very significant overdensity of class M giant stars in a part of the sky occupied by the Canis Major constellation, along with several other related structures composed of this type of star, two of which form broad, faint arcs. Characteristics Astronomers believe that the dwarf galaxy is in the process of being pulled apart by the gravitational field of the more massive Milky Way galaxy. The main body of the galaxy is extremely degraded. Tidal disruption causes a filament of stars to trail behind it as it orbits the Milky Way, forming a complex ringlike structure, sometimes referred to as the Monoceros Ring, which wraps around our galaxy three times. See section \\"The Canis Major Dwarf\\". The stream of stars was discovered in the early 21st century by astronomers conducting the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. It was in the course of investigating this ring of stars, and a closely spaced group of globular clusters similar to those associated with the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, that the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy was discovered. Globular clusters thought to be associated with the Canis Major Dwarf galaxy include NGC 1851, NGC 1904, NGC 2298 and NGC 2808, all of which may have been part of the galaxy's globular cluster system before accreting into the Milky Way. NGC 1261 is another nearby cluster, but its velocity differs enough to make its relationship to the system unclear. Additionally, Dolidze 25 and H18 are open clusters that may have formed when the dwarf galaxy perturbed material in the galactic disk, stimulating star formation. The discovery of the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy and subsequent analysis of the stars associated with it has provided some support for the current theory that galaxies may grow in size by swallowing their smaller neighbors. Martin et al. believe that the preponderance of evidence points to the accretion of a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way which was orbiting roughly in the plane of the galactic disk. Dispute Several studies cast doubts on the true nature of this overdensity. Some research suggests that the trail of stars is actually part of the warped galactic thin disk and thick disc population and not a result of the collision of the Milky Way with a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Investigation of the area in 2009 yielded only ten RR Lyrae variable stars which is consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy.

The volumes were intended to be read individually, rather than in series, which led to some overlapping but in their introductions to their parts of the series, Sir Keith Hancock and Sir James Butler wrote that this was to obviate a need to read more volumes than those covering that part of the war effort. Hancock edited the Civil Series and Butler the Military Series. The first volume appeared in 1949 and the last in 1993, with a revised edition of one volume appearing in 2004. An unorthodox decision was to cover the conflict from a theatre of operations point of view rather than by service, to acknowledge that military operations were intimately linked. The works published before 1970 lack references to unpublished sources until government archives were opened to an extent by the Public Records Act 1958 and the Public Records Act 1967.

After the release of The Jazz Singer, the first partially talking film, Hughes becomes obsessed with shooting his film realistically, and decides to convert the movie to a sound film. Despite the film being a hit, Hughes remains unsatisfied with the end result and orders the film to be recut after its Hollywood premiere. He becomes romantically involved with actress Katharine Hepburn, who helps to ease the symptoms of his worsening obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD). In 1935, Hughes test flies the H-1 Racer, pushing it to a new speed record, despite having to crash-land into a beet field when the aircraft runs out of fuel. Three years later, he breaks the world record by flying around the world in four days. He subsequently purchases majority interest in Transcontinental & Western Air (TWA). Juan Trippe, company rival and chairman of Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), gets his crony, Senator Owen Brewster, to introduce the Community Airline Bill, which would give Pan Am exclusivity on international air travel. Hepburn grows tired of Hughes' eccentricity, and leaves him for fellow actor Spencer Tracy. Hughes quickly finds a new love interest with 15-year-old Faith Domergue, and later actress Ava Gardner. However, he still has feelings for Hepburn, and bribes a reporter to keep reports about her and the married Tracy out of the press. In the mid 1940s, Hughes contracts two projects with the Army Air Forces, one for a spy aircraft, and another for a troop transport unit for use in World War II. In 1947, with the H-4 Hercules flying boat still in construction, Hughes finishes the XF-11 reconnaissance aircraft and takes it for a test flight. However, one of the engines fails midflight, and the aircraft crashes in Beverly Hills, with Hughes getting severely injured. The army cancels its order for the H-4 Hercules, although Hughes still continues the development with his own money. Dietrich informs Hughes that he must choose between funding the airlines or his \\"flying boat\\". Hughes orders Dietrich to mortgage the TWA assets so he can continue the development. As his OCD worsens, Hughes becomes increasingly paranoid, planting microphones and tapping Gardner's phone lines to keep track of her, until she kicks him out of her house. The FBI searches his home for incriminating evidence of war profiteering, searching his possessions and, to his horror, tracking dirt through his house. Brewster privately offers to drop the charges if Hughes sells TWA to Trippe, but Hughes refuses. Hughes' OCD symptoms become extreme, and he retreats into an isolated \\"germ-free zone\\" for three months. Trippe has Brewster summon him for a Senate investigation, certain that Hughes will not show up. Gardner visits him and personally grooms and dresses him in preparation for the hearing. He asks her to marry him, and she just laughs and says that he is \\"too crazy\\" for her. An invigorated Hughes defends himself against Brewster's charges and accuses the senator of taking bribes from Trippe. Hughes concludes by announcing that he has committed to completing the H-4 aircraft, and that he will leave the country if he cannot get it to fly. Brewster's bill is promptly defeated. After successfully flying the aircraft, Hughes speaks with Dietrich and his engineer, Glenn Odekirk, about a new jetliner for TWA. However, he begins hallucinating men in germ- resistant suits, and has a panic attack. As Odekirk hides him in a restroom while Dietrich fetches a doctor, Hughes begins to have flashbacks of his childhood, his love for aviation and his ambition for success, compulsively repeating the phrase, \\"the way of the future\\".  Cast   Production  = Development = Warren Beatty planned to direct and star in a Hughes biopic in the early 1970s. He co-wrote the script with Bo Goldman after a proposed collaboration with Paul Schrader fell through. Goldman wrote his own script, Melvin and Howard, which depicted Hughes' possible relationship with Melvin Dummar. Beatty's thoughts regularly returned to the project over the years, and in 1990 he approached Steven Spielberg to direct Goldman's script. Beatty's Hughes biopic was eventually released under the title Rules Don't Apply in 2016. Charles Evans, Jr. purchased the film rights of Howard Hughes: The Untold Story () in 1993. Evans secured financing from New Regency Productions, but development stalled.Hughes, p.144-147 The Aviator was a joint production between Warner Bros, which handled Latin American and Canadian distribution, and Disney, which released the film internationally under its Miramax Films banner in the US and the UK. Disney previously developed a Hughes biopic with director Brian De Palma and actor Nicolas Cage between 1997 and 1998. Titled Mr. Hughes, the film would have starred Cage in the dual roles of both Hughes and Clifford Irving. It was conceived when De Palma and Cage were working on Snake Eyes with writer David Koepp. Universal Pictures joined the competition in March 1998 when it purchased the film rights to Empire: The Life, Legend and Madness of Howard Hughes (), written by Donald Barlett and James Steele. The Hughes brothers were going to direct Johnny Depp as Howard Hughes, based on a script by Terry Hayes, Universal canceled it when it decided it did not want to fast-track development to compete with Disney. Following the disappointing release of Snake Eyes in August 1998, Disney placed Mr. Hughes in turnaround. In the mid 1990s and early 2000s, director Milo≈° Forman was in talks to direct a film about the early life Hughes with Edward Norton as the eccentric young billionaire. Also, in the early 2000s, director Christopher Nolan was developing a film about Hughes based on the book Hughes: The Private Diaries, Memos and Letters by Richard Hack. The film was shelved when Scorsese was on board to direct The Aviator. Nolan returned to his Howard Hughes project after completing The Dark Knight Rises. This time, Nolan used the book Citizen Hughes: The Power, the Money and the Madness by Michael Drosnin as the source of his film. Nolan wrote the script and the script follows the darker and final years of Hughes's life. Nolan, once again, shelved the project when Warren Beatty was developing his long-awaited Hughes film. It was reported that Nolan's Hughes film was to star Jim Carrey as the reclusive, elderly billionaire. Disney restarted development on a new Howard Hughes biopic in June 1999, hiring Michael Mann to direct Leonardo DiCaprio playing the role of Howard Hughes, based on a script by John Logan. The studio put it in turnaround again following the disappointing box-office performance of Mann's critically acclaimed The Insider. New Line Cinema picked it up in turnaround almost immediately, with Mann planning to direct after finishing Ali. Mann was eventually replaced with DiCaprio's Gangs of New York director Martin Scorsese. Scorsese later said that he \\"grossly misjudged the budget\\". Howard Hughes suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), most notably an obsession with germs and cleanliness. Scorsese and DiCaprio worked closely with Dr. Jeffrey M. Schwartz, MD of UCLA, to portray the most accurate depiction of OCD. The filmmakers had to focus both on previous accounts of Hughes‚Äô behaviors as well as the time period, given that when Hughes was suffering from the disorder, there was no psychiatric definition for what ailed him. Instead of receiving proper treatment, Hughes was forced to hide his stigmatized compulsions; his disorder began to conflict with everyday functioning. DiCaprio dedicated hundreds of hours of work to portray Hughes' unique case of OCD on screen. Apart from doing his research on Hughes, DiCaprio met with people suffering from OCD. In particular, he focused on the way some individuals would compulsively and repeatedly wash their hands, later inspiring the scene in which his hand starts to bleed as he scrubs it in the bathroom. The character arc of Howard Hughes was a drastic one: from the height of his career to the appearance of his compulsions, and eventually, to him sitting naked in a screening room, refusing to leave, and later repeating the phrase \\"the way of the future.\\"Kinsey, Beck. \\"The Affliction of Howard Hughes: OCD ‚Äì Aviator ‚Äì Martin Scorsese ‚Äì Leonardo DiCaprio\\" January 2014 via youtube.com. Retrieved October 22, 2014. = Cinematography = Hughes crashes in a field; screenshot showing the simulated bipack color film used in scenes depicting events before 1935. In an article for the American Cinematographer, John Pavlus wrote: \\"The film boasts an ambitious fusion of period lighting techniques, extensive effects sequences and a digital re-creation of two extinct cinema color processes: two-color and three-strip Technicolor.\\" For the first 52 minutes of the film, scenes appear in shades of only red and cyan blue; green objects are rendered as blue. This was done, according to Scorsese, to emulate the look of early bipack color films, in particular the Multicolor process, which Hughes himself owned, emulating the available technology of the era. Similarly, many of the scenes depicting events occurring after 1935 are treated to emulate the saturated appearance of three- strip Technicolor. Other scenes were stock footage colorized and incorporated into the film. The color effects were created by Legend Films. = Production design = Scale models were used to duplicate many of the flying scenes in the film. When Martin Scorsese began planning his aviation epic, a decision was made to film flying sequences with scale models rather than CGI special effects. The critical reaction to the CGI models in Pearl Harbor (2001) had been a crucial factor in Scorsese's decision to use full-scale static and scale models in this case. The building and filming of the flying models proved both cost-effective and timely. The primary scale models were the Spruce Goose and the XF-11; both flyable scale models were designed and fabricated over a period of several months by Aero Telemetry, an aerospace company that specializes in building unmanned air vehicles. The Spruce Goose model had a wingspan of while the XF-11 had a wingspan. Another set of miniatures was built as a motion control miniature used for \\"beauty shots\\" of the model taking off and in flight as well as in dry dock and under construction at the miniature Hughes Hangar built by New Deal Studios. The XF-11 was reverse engineered from photographs and some rare drawings and then modeled in Rhinoceros 3D by the Aero Telemetry engineering department and New Deal art department. These 3D models of the Spruce Goose as well as the XF-11 were then used for patterns and construction drawings for the model makers. In addition to the aircraft, the homes that the XF-11 crashes into were fabricated at 1:4 scale to match the 1:4 scale XF-11. The model was rigged to be crashed and break up several times for different shots. The Aero Telemetry team was given only three months to complete three models including the 450 lb H-1 Racer, with an wingspan, that had to stand-in for the full-scale replica that was destroyed in a crash, shortly before principal photography began.Baker, Mark. \\"Cottage Grove pilot dies in replica of historic plane.\\" The Register-Guard, August 6, 2003 via ArticleArchives.com. Retrieved February 22, 2015. The models were shot on location at Long Beach and other California sites from helicopter or raft platforms. The short but much heralded flight of Hughes‚Äô HK-1 Hercules on November 2, 1947 was realistically recreated in the Port of Long Beach. The motion control Spruce Goose and Hughes Hangar miniatures built by New Deal Studios are no longer on display at the Evergreen Aviation Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, with the original Hughes HK-1 Spruce Goose.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four and described the film and its subject, Howard Hughes, in these terms: \\"What a sad man. What brief glory. What an enthralling film...There's a match here between Scorsese and his subject, perhaps because the director's own life journey allows him to see Howard Hughes with insight, sympathy ‚Äì and, up to a point, with admiration.

Of the film, he said it is \\"a gorgeous tribute to the Golden Age of Hollywood\\" even though it \\"tips the balance of spectacle versus substance in favour of the former.\\" David T. Courtwright in The Journal of American History characterized The Aviator as a technically brilliant and emotionally disturbing film. According to him, the main achievement for Scorsese is that he managed to restore the name of Howard Hughes as a pioneer aviator. = Accolades = The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, winning five for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction and Best Supporting Actress for Blanchett.

Aircraft depicted and used  Numerous aircraft were depicted and/or actually used in the film, and were organic to the story. These included aircraft that Hughes had built, airliners that his airline (TWA) used, and other aircraft. Among these were: * Jim Wright's Replica of the Hughes H-1 Racer Hughes H-1 Racer, a pioneering single-engine race plane that set early speed records, including the 1935 international speed record of 352 mph, and the 1937 U.S. transcontinental record of seven hours, 28 minutes. It featured many relatively new innovations in aircraft design, and was the \\"state of the art\\" aircraft of its time, briefly. The original is in the Smithsonian's National Air & Space Museum. A replica planned for the movie crashed, and a model was used instead.Lerner, Preston, \\"Howard Hughes' Top Ten,\\" , November 2004, Air & Space magazine, retrieved February 2, 2017 (NOTE: This link is to the first web page of a four-page article)Rumerman, Judy, \\"The Hughes Companies\\" , 2003, U.S. Centennial of Flight website, as restored and reposted by American Aviation Historical Society, retrieved February 2, 2017 * The second XF-11Hughes XF-11, an interceptor / spy plane‚Äîa twin-engine, twin- tail-boom, fast, high-flying aircraft designed during World War II to fly faster and higher than enemy fighters.

Hughes crashed it on its first test flight (as depicted in the movie), killing a person on the ground and critically injuring himself. A second prototype flew well, though the military chose other aircraft for its purpose. As the movie shows, Hughes was subsequently accused of duping the military, and failing to deliver‚Äîleading to a Congressional investigation of Hughes.

As depicted in the movie, Hughes was subsequently accused of duping the military, and failing to deliver‚Äîand the Hercules was one of the topics in the resulting Congressional investigation. Hughes responded that he would prove the Hercules could fly‚Äîand subsequently did so in a short hop in Long Beach Harbor (though historians note that the aircraft never escaped the \\"ground effect\\" cushion of air, near the surface, to fly completely free and at altitude).

He is well known for achieving over 130 first ascents, many in California's Sierra Nevada and Montana's Glacier National Park. He also set a speed climbing record on California's Mount Shasta in 1923. The Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley has 1467 articles written by Clyde in its archives.  Early life, marriage and work  Clyde was born in Philadelphia, the son of a Reformed Presbyterian minister. He attended Geneva College graduating in the Classics in June 1909. After teaching at several rural schools, including Fargo, North Dakota and Mount Pleasant, Utah, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley in 1911. After two years of graduate work he returned to teaching, mostly in northern California, including the towns of McCloud and Weaverville. He taught history, science and Latin. He continued graduate studies at the University of California in Berkeley in 1923‚Äì24. On June 15, 1915, Norman Clyde married Winifred May Bolster in Pasadena, California. She was a nurse at a tuberculosis hospital, and contracted the disease herself at approximately the time of their marriage. After 4 years of suffering she died at age 28 in 1919. His wife's death appears to have profoundly affected him as he moved to the Eastern Sierra to spend much of his latter life alone in the mountains. The Chaney cabin where Clyde was winter caretaker He became principal of the high school at Independence, California in 1924, but resigned in 1928. He admitted firing a pistol during a confrontation with some students who allegedly came to vandalize the school on Halloween night. One bullet hit the side of a car carrying eight high school students, but there were no injuries. Clyde said that considerable damage had been done to the school grounds the previous Halloween. He had been issued a license to carry a concealed firearm on February 2, 1928. This was the end of his career as a schoolteacher and principal, as he resigned in exchange for an agreement by the District Attorney not to press charges. Subsequently he spent his winters as the caretaker of the local lodges, including Glacier Lodge on Big Pine Creek, and a fishing cabin which belonged to Lon Chaney, Sr. He earned some sporadic income as a mountain guide and freelance writer.  Life in the mountains  Clyde began climbing in the Sierra Nevada in 1910, when he visited Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks, writing to his mother that \\"I climbed the highest mountains in the region\\". He also visited McCloud, near Mount Shasta, that summer. He began a regimented program of mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada in 1914, including the first of his first ascents. He also joined the Sierra Club in 1914. He first climbed Mount Shasta in 1916, and climbed that peak a total of 12 times. While living in Southern California during his wife's illness, he climbed Mount San Jacinto in 1917. Following his wife's death in 1919, he climbed extensively in the Kings-Kern Divide region of the southern Sierra. In 1920, Clyde journeyed with a Sierra Club group from Yosemite Valley to the Evolution Basin, completing many climbs along the way. He set a speed climbing record on Mount Shasta in 1923, ascending from Horse Camp at approximately to the summit at in 3 hours and 17 minutes. That year, he also spent 36 days in Glacier National Park, Montana, where he climbed 36 mountains, including 11 first ascents. The National Park Service issued a press release praising his accomplishments in Glacier National Park. He returned to climb in Glacier National Park in 1924 and 1937. In 1925, he completed 53 climbs in the Sierra Nevada, and told Francis Farquhar that \\"I sometimes think I climbed enough peaks this summer to render me a candidate for a padded cell‚Äîat least some people look at the matter in that way. However, I get a lot of enjoyment from this rather strenuous form of diversion.\\" In 1926, he climbed in Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, the Beartooth Mountains and Absaroka Range of Montana, and the Sawtooth Range of Idaho. He made several additional first ascents in California that year. In 1928, he was a leader of the High Trip to the Canadian Rockies organized by the Sierra Club, the Mazamas of Oregon, and The Mountaineers of the State of Washington. During this trip, he encountered professional mountain guides, and probably decided on this as his own career path. He spent six weeks traversing the San Gabriels of Southern California, probably in 1929. In 1930, he wrote an article describing his trip from the summit of Mount Whitney to the lowest point in Death Valley between sunrise and sunset. Clyde's first published works appeared as a series of articles entitled \\"Close Ups of the High Sierra\\" in 1928, in the Automobile Club of Southern California's magazine, Touring Topics, and were later republished as a perfect-bound edition in 1962 by La Siesta Press (Glendale, California), edited by Walt Wheelock. Photo of Jules Eichorn, Norman Clyde, Robert L. M. Underhill and Glen Dawson taken the day after the first ascent of the East Face of Mount Whitney 1931 was a seminal year in the history of mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada, and Norman Clyde was in the midst of it. Sierra Club leader Francis P. Farquhar invited Harvard philosophy professor and Appalachian Mountain Club member Robert L. M. Underhill to come to the Sierra Nevada to teach the latest techniques of roped climbing. Underhill had learned these techniques in the Alps, and had practiced them himself earlier that summer in the Tetons and the Canadian Rockies. After some young climbers were instructed in the techniques, a group including Clyde, Jules Eichorn, Lewis Clark, Bestor Robinson and Glen Dawson traveled south to the Palisades, the most rugged and alpine part of the Sierra Nevada. There, on August 13, 1931, the party completed the first ascent of the last unclimbed 14,000+ foot peak in California, which remained unnamed due to its remote location above the Palisade Glaciers. After a challenging ascent to the summit, the climbers were caught in an intense lightning storm, and Eichorn barely escaped electrocution when \\"a thunderbolt whizzed right by my ear\\". The mountain was named Thunderbolt Peak to commemorate that close call. Three days later on August 16, Eichorn, Clyde, Underhill and Dawson completed the first ascent of the East Face of Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the contiguous United States. The route was extremely exposed, especially the famous Fresh Air Traverse. Steve Roper called this route \\"one of the classic routes of the Sierra, partly because of its spectacular location and partly because it was the first really big wall to be climbed in the range.\\" Porcella & Burns wrote that \\"the climb heralded a new standard of technical competence in Californian rock climbing...\\" These events led to a lifelong friendship between Clyde and Jules Eichorn. In 1932, he climbed El Picacho del Diablo in Baja California, Mexico, and climbed it again in 1937. He met David Brower in the Sierra Nevada in 1933, and in 1934 spent time with Brower and Hervey Voge as the younger men bagged 32 first ascents in ten weeks traveling through the High Sierra. From June 23‚Äì26, the trio climbed 10 of the 12 major pinnacles of the Devils Crags. Norman Clyde in Le Conte Canyon 1945He served as climbing leader on many High Trips sponsored by the Sierra Club and became known as \\"the pack that walks like a man\\" because of the huge backpacks he carried. In addition to as many as five cameras, he carried a hammer and cobbler's anvil in order to make field repairs to client's boots. In 1931, Underhill wrote that Clyde's backpack was an \\"especially picturesque enormity of skyscraper architecture\\". Clyde was also well known for wearing a campaign hat. Clyde led or participated in many mountain rescues and is credited with saving a number of lives. He also helped in many recoveries of dead climbers, such as 18-year-old Howard Lamel, killed in a fall on Mount Whitney in 1930. He is remembered for discovering Pete Starr's body in the Minarets, in 1933, after all other searchers gave up. Clyde later returned to the site with Jules Eichorn, and they buried Starr's body where Clyde had found it on Michael Minaret. Norman Clyde still guided parties into the Sierra into the 1960s, when he was in his seventies. In the 1950s and 1960s, he lived by himself at the old Baker ranch- house on Baker Creek near Big Pine. Because he was trained in the classics, Norman Clyde loved to read books in Latin and Greek. At the Baker ranch-house, Clyde had thousands of rare classical books. At age 80, he was still sleeping outside the ranch-house on a mattress and sleeping bag, as long as it was fair weather. In the spring of 1968, he transferred to a skilled nursing facility in Bishop where he could receive adequate care. In 1969, his cancerous left eye was removed. He died in Bishop on December 23, 1972, at age 87, surrounded by the high peaks of the Sierra Nevada that he loved so much. The cause of death was \\"metastatic melanoma ‚Äì primary in eye.\\"  Legacy  The Norman Clyde exhibit at the Eastern California Museum in Independence, California Norman Clyde received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from his alma mater, Geneva College, in 1939. He received the college's Distinguished Service Award in 1962. In 1947, the Sierra Club Handbook praised Clyde's mountaineering accomplishments: > Outstanding among members who have helped others gain mountain experience is > Norman Clyde, whose amazing achievements in scaling practically all the > peaks in the High Sierra are well known to mountaineers. More than one > climber has exulted in a supposedly first ascent, only to find later that > Clyde went up that \\"unclimbed peak\\" in the winter of, say, 1920! There are > many seasoned climbers who can look back on their early days as novices in > the mountains and remember with gratitude what they learned from Clyde. Jointly with Allen Steck, he was the first recipient of the Sierra Club's Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award in 1970. Clyde Minaret, Clyde's Ledge, Clyde's Meadow along the Mountaineer's Route on Mount Whitney, and Norman Clyde Peak bear his name. His ashes were scattered from Norman Clyde Peak by Smoke Blanchard, his son Bob Blanchard and a party that included Jules Eichorn. The Eastern California Museum in Independence has an extensive collection of memorabilia, documents and photos pertaining to Clyde's life on display. Wall Street Journal extreme sports correspondent Michael J. Ybarra described this exhibit as \\"absorbing\\". Norman Clyde's life and mountaineering achievements were originally documented in the book, Close Ups of the High Sierra, published by La Siesta Press (Glendale, California) in 1962. In 1998 Spotted Dog Press published an expanded edition of the book, Norman Clyde: Close Up of the High Sierra, edited by Wynne Benti. The foreword for the 1998 edition of Close Ups of the High Sierra included a brief biography on Clyde, written by Benti, and was the first time in history that any in-depth information was published about Clyde's wife, Winifred Bolster. Clyde's life and mountaineering achievements were later documented in a biography written by Robert C. Pavlik and published in 2008.

It is the headquarters of the Communist Party of Britain and Croydon's Labour, Trade Union and Co-operative movements and is itself a co- operative with shareholders from organisations across the four movements.  Ruskin House timeline  =The first Ruskin House= In the nineteenth century, Croydon was a bustling commercial centre in Surrey but in close proximity to London. It was said that, at the turn of the twentieth century, approximately ¬£10,000 was spent in Croydon's taverns and inns every week. For the early labour movement, then, it was natural to meet in the town's public houses, in this environment. However, the temperance movement was equally strong, and Georgina King Lewis, a keen member of the Croydon United Temperance Council, took it upon herself to establish a dry centre for the labour movement. Named after John Ruskin, the first Ruskin House was highly successful. It was described as one of the greatest temperance achievements in the history of Croydon. Meetings took place every night wherever space was available. Indeed, requests for meeting space were frequently turned down. Many trade union branches, friendly societies and the Labour Party all held their meetings here. =The second Ruskin House= By the end of the First World War, the local labour movement had far outgrown its main premises. Therefore, in 1919, a private residence named 'Netherton' on Wellesley Road was bought by the Ruskin House committee. In the 1920s, the Labour Party employed full-time staff in the building. Later, in the 1930s and 1940s, whist drives, socials and dances, political rallies and meetings, and even a Ruskin Repertory Theatre were based in the building. The Young Communist League held its meetings in the building. In the 1960s, Croydon's centre underwent massive reconstruction, and the second Ruskin House was demolished. =The current Ruskin House= In 1966, a well-proportioned Georgian townhouse in Coombe Road was purchased by the Ruskin House committee. It had formerly been the home of an Italian vice-consul and a private prep school. It was officially opened in 1967 by the then Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson. With a large, walled garden, the building is in pleasant surroundings. Far removed from the original dry Ruskin House, the current building has its own bar. Today, Ruskin House continues to serve as the headquarters of the trade union, Labour and Co-operative movements in Croydon, hosting a range of meetings and being the base for several labour movement groups. Office tenants include the headquarters of the Communist Party of Britain and Croydon Labour Party. Geraint Davies, the MP for Croydon Central until 2005, also had offices in the building.

He was born in Sutton, Surrey and managed Aston Villa to success in the 1982 European Cup, three months after taking charge. He followed this up by beating Barcelona in the 1982 European Super Cup. Playing career Tony Barton won England Schoolboy (1 cap) and Youth (5 caps) honours before beginning his football career with Fulham who he joined as a junior. After a spell on loan to Sutton United, he turned professional with Fulham in May 1954. He went on to score 8 times in 49 games for Fulham. He moved to Nottingham Forest in December 1959 and after never really establishing himself at Forest, making only 22 appearances (scoring once), moved to Portsmouth in December 1961, where he subsequently became player-coach. After retiring as a player, after 130 games and 34 goals for Portsmouth, he remained on the club's coaching staff. Coaching and managerial career He subsequently joined the coaching staff at Aston Villa, becoming assistant manager to Ron Saunders in 1980. Villa won the League Championship in 1981 (their first league title in 71 years) and Barton was promoted to the manager's seat in February 1982 after Saunders resigned. He guided Villa to victory over Bayern Munich in the 1982 European Cup Final and followed this up with the 1982 European Super Cup the following season, but their league form (sixth in 1983 and tenth in 1984) did not match their success in Europe and he was sacked in May 1984. In July 1984, he took over as manager of Northampton Town but left in April 1985 after suffering a heart attack. In September that year he became assistant manager of Southampton under Chris Nicholl, remaining at The Dell until May 1988. He later became assistant manager of Portsmouth and in February 1991 took over as caretaker manager after the sacking of Frank Burrows. After leaving Portsmouth he was a talent scout for several clubs. Shortly before Barton's death he was offered the first manager's job at Wessex League new boys Petersfield Town. On 20 August 1993, Barton died of a heart attack at the age of 56.

During his diving career he won medals at all major international events including a silver at the Athens Olympics. Following his retirement from competition, Taylor transitioned to a portfolio of projects. He now speaks about mental wellness, supports the SportsAid charity, teaches yoga and mental wellness, works for an executive performance business and commentates for the BBC.  Background  Taylor was born and educated in Cheltenham where he attended Bournside School. He was hyperactive as a child and his parents were advised to channel his energies and enthusiasm into sport. He was a swimmer and gymnast from the age of two and took up competitive diving when he was eight. By the age of 11 he was a national champion. He trained at Cheltenham Leisure Centre under Dave Turner and then Ian Barr until 1996.  Diving career  Taylor represented Great Britain at three Summer Olympic Games and was a member of the Great Britain team for 16 years winning medals at all major international championships. In the diving events at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, he won the Silver medal in the men's synchronised 10-metre platform, with partner Peter Waterfield. It was Britain's first Olympic diving medal since Brian Phelps in 1960. He had come fourth in the same competition in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Other achievements include Silver in the men's 10 m platform at the 2002 Commonwealth Games (he had won Bronze in 1998), and Bronze in the 10 m synchro at the 1999 European Aquatics Championships. At a national level, Taylor held both the 10 m platform and 10 m synchro titles from 1994 to 2006. He trained with other members of the British team in the Ponds Forge swimming complex in Sheffield. In 1998 Leon invented the 5255b; a back 2.5 somersaults, 2.5 twists which at the time was the World's most difficult dive with a tariff of 3.8. Following a rule change in 2009, the dive now carries a tariff of 3.6.  Retirement and post- competitive career  Although Taylor had been planning to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics, he announced his retirement from competition in May of that year following a number of injuries. Between 2006 ‚Äì 2008, he completed an HNC (Higher National Certificate) Business and Finance from Sheffield Hallam University. Taylor now works as a public speaker, presenter, conference host, BBC commentator and mentor to members of the British team. In 2010 Taylor published a book on the subject of mentoring: MENTOR - The most important role you were never trained for. This work built on his experience of mentoring many athletes, most notably Olympic medalist Tom Daley. In January 2013, Taylor was named as a judge on the ITV celebrity diving show Splash!. He returned to judge on the show in its second series, airing in 2014. Taylor had planned, and booked, a once-in-a-lifetime trip to New Zealand with his girlfriend when 'Splash' came about instead.https://aquaticregister.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/61/ In 2016 Taylor was part of the BBC commentary team for the diving events at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio and for the 2017 World Aquatics Championships. In 2018, Taylor spoke at the TEDx Clapham event on the subject of managing prolongued mental stress with the aid of physical movement. He has followed this with a series of videos on the subject of stress. In March 2020, Taylor led a series of exercise routines for the Headspace mobile app. Bibliography *  References   External links  * * Official Twitter account * TEDx talk - How to manage your mental health Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:English male divers Category:Divers at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Divers at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Divers at the 1998 Commonwealth Games Category:Divers at the 2002 Commonwealth Games Category:Divers at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Alumni of Sheffield Hallam University Category:Olympic divers of Great Britain Category:Olympic silver medallists for Great Britain Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for England Category:Commonwealth Games silver medallists for England Category:Commonwealth Games bronze medallists for England Category:Sportspeople from Sheffield Category:Olympic medalists in diving Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:World Aquatics Championships medalists Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in diving ","title":"Leon Taylor"},{"id":"1141459","text":"The foureye butterflyfish (Chaetodon capistratus) is a butterflyfish (family Chaetodontidae). It is alternatively called the four-eyed butterflyfish. This species is found in the Western Atlantic from Massachusetts, USA and Bermuda to the West Indies and northern South America.FishBase (2008) Chaetodon capistratus is the type species of Chaetodon.CoF (2008) If this genus is split up as some have proposed, it will retain its present name like its closest relatives, which include the banded butterflyfish (C. striatus) and the spot- finned butterflyfish (C. ocellatus).Fessler & Westneat (2007) Description and ecology Foureye butterflyfish are deep-bodied and laterally compressed, with a single dorsal fin and a small mouth with tiny, bristle like teeth. The body is light grey, sometimes with a yellowish hue, and dark forward-pointing chevrons. The ventral fins are yellow. The species gets its common name from a large dark spot on the rear portion of each side of the body. This spot is surrounded by a brilliant white ring, resembling an eye. A black vertical bar on the head runs through the true eye, making it hard to see. This pattern may result in a predator confusing the back end of the fish for the front end. The foureye butterflyfish's first instinct when threatened is to flee, putting the false eye spot closer to the predator than the head. Most predators aim for the eyes, and this false eye spot may in automimicry trick the predator into believing that the fish will flee tail first. Other potential functions of the eye spot exist. The eye spots are larger and more variable than the real eye and eye spot shape varies from vertically oval in young to more circular in adults. These features suggest other possible functions of the eye spot including: intimidating prey, altering predation reaction distances, disorientating predators, serving as a general warning, or for social communication.Meadows, D.W. Morphological variation in eyespots of the foureye butterflyfish (Chaetodon capistratus): Implications for eyespot function.Copeia\\";; v1993, n1, 235-240. When escape is not possible, a foureye butterflyfish will sometimes turn to face its aggressor, head lowered and spines fully erect, like a bull about to charge. This may serve to intimidate the other animal or may remind the predator that the butterflyfish is much too spiny to make a comfortable meal. Foureye butterflyfish usually frequent shallow inshore waters, where they feed on a variety of invertebrates, mainly zoantharians, polychaete worms, gorgonians and tunicates. This fish is known for its uncanny ability to swim in and around coral heads and reefs. They are able to find their way through the most intricate passages by swimming on its side or even upside down. Like its relatives they mate for life and therefore they will often be seen in pairs. They are one of a few fish that mate for life.

Originally developed for the Macintosh, it was later distributed on Microsoft Windows, OS/2, NeXTSTEP and several other commercial flavors of Unix. In spite of many positive reviews, including one calling it \\"clearly the spreadsheet of the future\\", the market was rapidly entrenching Microsoft Excel. Informix eventually gave up on the desktop market and reverted solely to database sales in the mid-1990s. Claris licensed and sold an extensively cleaned up version as Claris Resolve in 1991, but it was far too late to market to have any effect. History Wingz was originally written solely for the Macintosh by Innovative Software in Lenexa, KS (publishers of the SmartWare Suite on the PC) and was ready for release in late 1988. Informix wanted to enter the desktop software market with products that could link to their back-end databases, and Wingz seemed like a good fit. They purchased the product and released it largely as-is in early 1989. The release was built up by extensive promotion on the part of Informix, including giving away a then- unprecedented array of \\"convention swag,\\" including high quality Wingz red canvas tradeshow bags. For nearly a year, the buildup was focused around the \\"Wingz Time Shuttle,\\" an enclosed theatre which traveled MacWorlds in 1988 and 1989. The focal creatives included a video narrated by Leonard Nimoy and automated demos of the product. The video took attendees into \\"the future of spreadsheet design, past the legacy of failed old products [like Excel]\\". Features The most obvious feature, and the easiest to \\"checkbox review\\", was the size of the spreadsheets Wingz could process. Excel's maximum size was 256 columns by 16384 rows, while Wingz could handle spreadsheets up to 32768 in both directions. At the time spreadsheets were still being compared primarily on this feature. A less-obvious feature was that Wingz allowed simple in-cell editing, whereas contemporary versions of Excel forced you to use a separate data-entry bar. Another clear difference between Wingz and Excel was Wingz' powerful graphing system, once regarded as the most powerful available in any spreadsheet. Wingz' graphing system allowed the resulting graphs to be placed directly in the spreadsheets. At the time Excel offered an anemic variety of 2D graphs, and they could only be displayed in a separate view. Additionally Wingz made it easy to make the graphs and modify them, allowing you to see your changes in real-time directly in the spreadsheet where the changes were being made. At the time it was an \\"obvious\\" feature, but one that no other program had managed to make work correctly. A more hidden feature was HyperScript, a macro-programming language deliberately modelled on HyperCard's HyperTalk.Brian Murphy, et al, \\"Spreadsheet Statistics for Teaching and Production\\", ICOTS 3, 1990T. C. O'Haver, \\"Object-Oriented Spreadsheets as a Custom Software Development Environment\\", University of Maryland, 1992 HyperScript allowed even new users to write fairly powerful macros, which could include user-interface features such as buttons and dialog boxes. HyperScript 1.0 was missing some rather obvious features. For instance it could not open another spreadsheet, although it could refer to one if the user opened that for it. A less hidden \\"feature\\" was that the program shipped with a number of bugs, which tainted the release. It also lacked a number of mathematical functions that Excel handled internally, and had no direct importer/exporter for Excel files. Microsoft responded to the release of Wingz, and others such as Ashton-Tate's Full Impact and the Mac version of Lotus 1-2-3 that came out about the same time, by starting an extensive upgrade to Excel. They were soon showing it around claiming it would have all the features of Wingz -- in-sheet graphics, large spreadsheets, etc. When it was finally released it was true many of these features were supported, but it was not considered user-friendly. It was only a short period of time before a Wingz 1.1 release fixed many of these issues, but it was long enough that the product was never able to regain its momentum. It also seemed that Informix never really understood how to market the product, and it is likely 'Not Invented Here' played a major part in the problems as well -- the purchase of Wingz and Smartware prompted Roger Sippl, one of the founders of Informix, to leave the company. Shortly after Sippl left, Phil White, the new CEO of Informix, announced that Informix would no longer be competing in the desktop application space. Joe Erickson, the lead developer of the Smart Spreadsheet, Wingz, Formula One VBX, Formula One ActiveX, Formula One for Java and SpreadsheetGear for .NET, left shortly after that. Future releases focused on bringing the product to new platforms as their GUI's matured, and adding functionality to HyperScript to allow it to directly interact with databases. Soon it was being marketed primarily as a data access tool, and eventually the name Wingz was dropped and the product became HyperScript Tools. After several years of ignoring it further, it was sold off to Investment Intelligence Systems in the UK. At some unknown point Wingz was bought by a company in San Jose, CA called PDF Solutions which now uses Wingz as a private base for their DataPOWER Semiconductor yield management software packages. Claris, Apple Computer's onetime software arm, licensed Wingz in the early 1990s after Informix lost interest in the Mac market. They updated it slightly with the addition of the Claris-standard UI (toolbars, color palettes, etc.) and released it as Resolve in 1991. By this time Excel was entrenched, and sales of Resolve were tiny. Claris never released a Resolve-MacWrite-Claris Impact bundle, and so were unable to gain a foothold in the high-end market now dominated by Microsoft Office. They eventually cancelled development in 1993, ending sales in 1994. Claris did offer an \\"Office suite\\", composed of MacWrite Pro, Claris Resolve, and MacDraw Pro. Although this suite didn't include a database (e.g., Filemaker Pro) or a dedicated Desktop Presentations application, although MacDraw Pro did provide some such features, they positioned it to compete against MS Office. The ClarisImpact program was released much later than ClarisOffice and was never included as part of the suite.

It is planned to have a collision energy of 500 GeV initially, with the possibility for a later upgrade to 1000 GeV (1 TeV). Although early proposed locations for the ILC were Japan, Europe (CERN) and the USA (Fermilab), the Kitakami highland in the Iwate prefecture of northern Japan has been the focus of ILC design efforts since 2013. The Japanese government is willing to contribute half of the costs, according to the coordinator of study for detectors at the ILC. The ILC would collide electrons with positrons. It will be between 30 km and 50 km (19‚Äì31 mi) long, more than 10 times as long as the 50 GeV Stanford Linear Accelerator, the longest existing linear particle accelerator. The proposal is based on previous similar proposals from Europe, the U.S., and Japan. Studies for an alternative project, the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) are also underway, which would operate at higher energies (up to 3 TeV) in a machine of length similar to the ILC. These two projects, CLIC and the ILC, have been unified under the Linear Collider Collaboration.  Background: linacs and synchrotrons  There are two basic shapes of accelerators. Linear accelerators (\\"linacs\\") accelerate elementary particles along a straight path. Circular accelerators (\\"synchrotrons\\"), such as the Tevatron, the LEP, and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), use circular paths. Circular geometry has significant advantages at energies up to and including tens of GeV: With a circular design, particles can be effectively accelerated over longer distances. Also, only a fraction of the particles brought onto a collision course actually collide. In a linear accelerator, the remaining particles are lost; in a ring accelerator, they keep circulating and are available for future collisions. The disadvantage of circular accelerators is that charged particles moving along bent paths will necessarily emit electromagnetic radiation known as synchrotron radiation. Energy loss through synchrotron radiation is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the mass of the particles in question. That is why it makes sense to build circular accelerators for heavy particles‚Äîhadron colliders such as the LHC for protons or, alternatively, for lead nuclei. An electron‚Äìpositron collider of the same size would never be able to achieve the same collision energies. In fact, energies at the LEP which used to occupy the tunnel now given over to the LHC, were limited to 209 GeV by energy loss via synchrotron radiation. Even though the nominal collision energy at the LHC will be higher than the ILC collision energy (14,000 GeV for the LHCSince the actual collisions happen between the constituent of protons‚Äîquarks, antiquarks and gluons‚Äîthe effective energy for collisions will be lower than 14,000 GeV but still higher than 500 GeV), a typical collision at the LHC will be of higher energy than a typical ILC collision. vs. ~500 GeV for the ILC), measurements could be made more accurately at the ILC. Collisions between electrons and positrons are much simpler to analyze than collisions in which the energy is distributed among the constituent quarks, antiquarks and gluons of baryonic particles. As such, one of the roles of the ILC would be making precision measurements of the properties of particles discovered at the LHC. ILC physics and detectors It is widely expected that effects of physics beyond that described in the current Standard Model will be detected by experiments at the proposed ILC. In addition, particles and interactions described by the Standard Model are expected to be discovered and measured. At the ILC physicists hope to be able to: * Measure the mass, spin, and interaction strengths of the Higgs boson * If existing, measure the number, size, and shape of any TeV-scale extra dimensions * Investigate the lightest supersymmetric particles, possible candidates for dark matter To achieve these goals, new generation particle detectors are necessary.  Merging of regional proposals into a worldwide project  In August 2004, the International Technology Recommendation Panel (ITRP) recommended a superconducting radio frequency technology for the accelerator. After this decision the three existing linear collider projects ‚Äì the Next Linear Collider (NLC), the Global Linear Collider (GLC) and Teraelectronvolt Energy Superconducting Linear Accelerator (TESLA) ‚Äì joined their efforts into one single project (the ILC). In March 2005, the International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA) announced Prof. Barry Barish, director of the LIGO Laboratory at Caltech from 1997 to 2005, as the Director of the Global Design Effort (GDE). In August 2007, the Reference Design Report for the ILC was released. Physicists working on the GDE completed a detailed ILC design report, publishing it in June 2013. Design The electron source for the ILC will use 2-nanosecond laser light pulses to eject electrons from a photocathode, a technique allowing for up to 80% of the electrons to be polarized; the electrons then will be accelerated to 5 GeV in a 370-meter linac stage. Synchrotron radiation from high energy electrons will produce electron-positron pairs on a titanium-alloy target, with as much as 60% polarization; the positrons from these collisions will be collected and accelerated to 5 GeV in a separate linac. To compact the 5 GeV electron and positron bunches to a sufficiently small size to be usefully collided, they will circulate for 0.1‚Äì0.2 seconds in a pair of damping rings, 3.24 km in circumference, in which they will be reduced in size to 6 mm in length and a vertical and horizontal emittance of 2 pm and 0.6 nm, respectively. From the damping rings the particle bunches will be sent to the superconducting radio frequency main linacs, each 11 km long, where they will be accelerated to 250 GeV. At this energy each beam will have an average power of about 5.3 megawatts. Five bunch trains will be produced and accelerated per second. To maintain a sufficient luminosity to produce results in a reasonable time frame after acceleration the bunches will be focused to a few nanometers in height and a few hundred nanometers in width. The focused bunches then will be collided inside one of two large particle detectors.

Proposed sites Originally, three sites for the International Linear Collider were leading contenders at established High Energy Physics centers in Europe. At CERN in Geneva the tunnel is located deep underground in non- permeable bedrock. This site was considered favorable for a number of practical reasons but due to the LHC the site was disfavored. At DESY in Hamburg the tunnel is close to the surface in water saturated soil. Germany leads Europe for scientific funding and was therefore considered reliable in terms of funding. At JINR in Dubna the tunnel is close to the surface in non- permeable soil. Dubna has a pre-accelerator complex which could have been easily adapted for the needs for the ILC. But all three were more or less well suited for housing a Linear Collider and one had ample choice for a site selection process in Europe. Outside Europe a number of countries expressed interest. Japan receives a large amount of funding for neutrino activities, such as the T2K experiment, a factor not in its favor, although 20 huge caverns with access tunnels have already been constructed in Japan for hydroelectric power plants (e.g. the Kannagawa Hydropower Plant). Following the closure of the Tevatron some groups within the USA had expressed interest, with Fermilab being a favored site because of the facilities and manpower already present. Much of the speculated interest from other countries was hearsay from within the scientific community, and very few facts were published officially. The information presented above is a summary of that contained in the International Workshop on Linear Colliders 2010 (ECFA-CLIC- ILC Joint Meeting) at CERN. The 2008 economic crisis led the United States and United Kingdom to cut funds to the collider project, leading to Japan's position as the most likely host for the International Linear Collider. On August 23, 2013, the Japanese high-energy physics community's site evaluation committee proposed it should be located in the Kitakami Mountains of the Iwate and Miyagi Prefectures. As of March 7, 2019, the Japanese government has stated that it is not ready to support the construction of the Collider due to its high proposed cost of approximately $7 billion. This decision was informed partly by the Science Council of Japan. The Japanese government is currently seeking monetary support from other countries to help fund this project. Cost The Reference Design Report estimated the cost of building the ILC, excluding R&D;, prototyping, land acquisition, underground easement costs, detectors, contingencies, and inflation, at US$6.75 billion (in 2007 prices). From formal project approval, completion of the accelerator complex and detectors is expected to require seven years. The host country would be required to pay $1.8 billion for site-specific costs like digging tunnels and shafts and supplying water and electricity. Former U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu estimated the total cost to be US$25 billion. ILC Director Barish said this is likely to be an overestimate.

Design Since ordinary-shaped rounds are inaccurate and have a very short range when used underwater, this pistol fires steel darts. It has five barrels, each of which is loaded with a cartridge, giving the gun a pepper-box appearance, and it is electrically ignited from a battery pack in the pistol grip. After firing all five cartridges, the barrel unit must be sent back to its manufacturer for reloading. It is very similar to its predecessor, the Mk 1 Underwater Defense Gun. In the past, Heckler & Koch has denied knowledge of its existence. This firearm is somewhat bulkier than its Soviet counterpart, the SPP-1 underwater pistol, but it has five barrels, as opposed to the Soviet firearm which has four. However, the SPP-1 does not need to be sent back to the manufacturer to be reloaded.

It is capable of Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) operations of up to 52 hours' duration at up to 10.5 km (35,000 ft). It has demonstrated 52 hours of continuous flight, but the effective operational maximal flight duration is less, according to payload and flight profile. An advanced version, the Heron TP, is also known as the IAI Eitan. On 11 September 2005, it was announced that the Israel Defense Forces purchased US$50 million worth of Heron systems. Design and development The Heron navigates using an internal GPS navigation device, and either a pre-programmed flight profile (in which case the system is fully autonomous from takeoff to landing), manual override from a ground control station, or a combination of both. It can autonomously return to base and land in case of lost communication with the ground station. The system has fully automatic launch and recovery (ALR) and all-weather capabilities. The Heron can carry an array of sensors, including thermographic camera (infrared) and visible-light airborne ground surveillance, intelligence systems (COMINT and ELINT) and various radar systems, totaling up to . The Heron is also capable of target acquisition and artillery adjustment. The payload sensors communicate with the ground control station in real time, using either direct line of sight data link, or via an airborne/satellite relay. Like the navigation system, the payload can also be used in either a fully pre-programmed autonomous mode, or manual real-time remote operation, or a combination of both. =Super Heron= At the February 2014 Singapore Air Show, IAI unveiled the Super Heron refinement of the Heron UAS. The Super Heron has a 200-horsepower diesel engine that increases its rate of climb and performance. Its range is line-of-sight and by satellite control. Endurance is 45 hours at a maximum altitude of .

During the deployment, each brigade combat team was assigned a UAV squadron for close support. This was the first Israeli operation in which UAVs, helicopters, and fighter jets were allocated to ground forces directly without IAF central command authorizing sorties. Air-support controller teams operated alongside brigade commanders at the front emphasizing the brigade commander's utilization of direct air assets. A high degree of situational awareness was achieved by maintaining at least a dozen UAVs in flight over Gaza at all times. Aerial surveillance was provided by Heron and Hermes 450 UAVs and Apache attack helicopters. Along with coordination between the air force and ground troops, Israeli ground forces were able to utilize cooperation with the Israel Security Agency by having operatives attached to the forward units. This inter-service coordination allowed for a higher level of tactical awareness and the ability to strike time-critical targets. Other countries operating the Heron include Singapore, India and Turkey. France operates a derivative of Heron named Eagle or Harfang. In 2008, Canada announced a plan to lease a Heron for use in Afghanistan, starting in 2009. In mid-2009, Australia leased two Herons as part of a multimillion-dollar lease to operate the vehicles in Afghanistan. In early July 2013, the Heron reached 15,000 flight hours over Afghanistan.Heron Logs 15,000 Flight Hours In Afghanistan ‚Äì sUASNews.com, 22 July 2013 Australia concluded its use of the Heron in support of Operation Slipper in Afghanistan on 30 November 2014, after it had accumulated 27,000 flight hours.PICTURES: RAAF Heron flies at Amberley alongside manned aircraft ‚Äì Flightglobal.com, 13 April 2016 Royal Australian Air Force retired two Herons in June 2017.  Heron variants  *Turkey operates a special variant of the Heron, which utilizes Turkish-designed and manufactured electro-optical subsystems. For example, the Turkish Herons use the ASELFLIR-300T airborne thermal Imaging and targeting system designed and manufactured by ASELSAN of Turkey. The Turkish Herons also have stronger engines in order to compensate for the added payload created by the heavier ASELFLIR-300T. This is the same FLIR system currently used in the TAI/AgustaWestland T129 attack helicopter and also the TAI Anka MALE UAV.

It is situated on the banks of the river Nidda in the Rhein-Main-Gebiet (Rhine-Main area), approximately north of Frankfurt. Division of the town Karben as a unified city was founded in 1970, comprising some smaller villages (Klein-Karben, Gross-Karben, Okarben, Kloppenheim, Rendel, Burg-Gr√§fenrode, and Petterweil). Infrastructure Karben has two railway stations (Gro√ü Karben and Okarben) on the Main‚ÄìWeser Railway and is served by line S6 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn. It has access to the A 661 autobahn and federal highway B3. The town hall is located in a newer district of Gross-Karben, as is a public swimming pool. The industrial district west of Gross- and Klein-Karben hosts several companies of national and international stature. History Karben is rich in history. The village of Okarben was once location of a Roman military castellum, forming a part of the limes, the Roman imperial border defence network and Karben‚Äôs mineral springs have been used by the Romans some 2000 years ago. Rendel, Karben‚Äôs oldest borough, was mentioned first in 774 in a deed of donation to the monastery of Lorch. Kloppenheim once belonged to an installation of the ‚ÄúDeutschen Orden‚Äù (Teutonic Knights Order), who maintained a small palace there. Gross-Karben hosts two more manors which were inhabited by local landlords. The ‚ÄúDegenfeld‚Äôsche Schloss‚Äù contains today Karben‚Äôs Museum on agriculture and local history. Gross-Karben, Klein-Karben, Okarben, Burg- Graefenrode and Rendel still have churches dating back from the Baroque period. Okarben experienced a face-change in the 19th century, when it started hosting workers for the newly established Main-Weser Railroad between Frankfurt and Kassel. The city has transformed itself from a bundle of independent villages living mostly of farming the rich soils of the Wetterau to a slowly integrating city providing housing for a growing population of commuters and space for several small and mid-sized enterprises, while maintaining much of its original rural charm.

The film stars Deborah Kerr, David Niven, Jean Seberg, Myl√®ne Demongeot and Geoffrey Horne, and features Juliette Gr√©co, Walter Chiari, Martita Hunt and Roland Culver. It was released by Columbia Pictures. This film had color and black-and-white sequences, a technique unusual for the 1950s, but widely used in silent movies and early sound movies. Plot On the French Riviera, C√©cile is a decadent young girl who lives with her rich playboy father, Raymond. Anne, a mature and cultured friend of Raymond's late wife, arrives at Raymond's villa for a visit. Anne and Raymond become close, but C√©cile finds that Anne threatens to reform the undisciplined way of life that she has shared with her father. Despite his promises of fidelity to Anne, Raymond cannot give up his playboy life. Helped by Elsa, Raymond's young and flighty mistress, C√©cile does her best to break up the relationship with Anne. The combination of the daughter's disdain and the father's rakishness drives Anne to a tragic end.Bonjour Tristesse (1957) ‚Äì Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast. Allmovie. Cast Critical reception The film met with a lukewarm critical reception at the time. The BFI's Monthly Film Bulletin wroteMonthly Film Bulletin, British Film Institute, No. 292. Vol. 25. May 1958. Page 55. \\"The best performance is David Niven's; he gives his part a pathetic touch that the writing never attains. Jean Seberg, who speaks rather than acts her lines, turns in the least effective performance. Bonjour Tristesse is an elegant, ice cold, charade of emotions, completely artificial and eventually torpid.\\" Others enjoyed it rather more and it had some unexpected friends. Fran√ßois Truffaut described Seberg as \\"The best actress in Europe\\". Jean-Luc Godard said \\"The character played by Jean Seberg (in Breathless) was a continuation of her role in Bonjour Tristesse, I could have taken the last shot of Preminger's film and started after dissolving to a title: \\"Three years later\\". An article in The Guardian, in 2012 described it as \\"an example of Hollywood's golden age, and both its star and its famously tyrannical director are ripe for rediscovery.\\" Stanley Kauffmann described Bonjour Tristesse as tedious. On Rotten Tomatoes, the movie has an approval rating 86% based on reviews from 12 critics.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bonjour_tristesse Critic Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York wrote: \\"the director uses the expansive CinemaScope frame and his eye for luxuriant, clinical mise en sc√®ne to soberly probe rather than gleefully prod. The cast is across-the-board exemplary. Niven and Kerr keenly satirize their onscreen iconographies‚Äîthe cad and the goody-goody, respectively‚Äîbut it's Seberg who cuts deepest.\\" References External links  * * Category:1958 films Category:1958 drama films Category:American films Category:British films Category:British drama films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on French novels Category:Films based on works by Fran√ßoise Sagan Category:Films directed by Otto Preminger Category:Films set on the French Riviera Category:Films shot in Saint-Tropez Category:Films partially in color Category:Films scored by Georges Auric Category:Films featuring a title sequence by Saul Bass ","title":"Bonjour Tristesse (film)"},{"id":"1141488","text":"Egon Joseph Wellesz (21 October 1885 ‚Äì Oxford, 9 November 1974) was an Austrian, later British composer, teacher and musicologist, notable particularly in the field of Byzantine music.  Life  Wellesz was born in Vienna. Although both parents of Wellesz's were Hungarian Christians, they both had Jewish ancestry. He received a Protestant upbringing, but later converted to Catholicism. Wellesz, who had originally studied law in accordance with his father's wishes, devoted himself entirely to music after attending a performance of Der Freisch√ºtz staged by Gustav Mahler at the Vienna Court Opera. He studied in Vienna under Arnold Schoenberg ‚Äì purportedly his first private pupil ‚Äì as well as Guido Adler, who founded the musicological institute in Vienna and was a leading editor of the Austrian Denkm√§ler. These dual influences shaped much of his musical and scholarly thought. In 1913, Wellesz embarked upon what would become a lifelong interest in the musical achievements of Byzantium. Wellesz left Austria for England in the wake of the Anschluss ‚Äì more specifically, Wellesz was in Amsterdam at the time by good fortune, to hear his orchestral piece Prosperos Beschw√∂rungen conducted by Bruno Walter on that day. In England he was interned as an enemy alien, ultimately in Hutchinson Camp in the Isle of Man, but he gained his release in 1943 thanks to the intercession of H. C. Colles, the long-standing chief music critic of The Times. Altogether he wrote nine symphonies and an equal number of string quartets, the former starting, in 1945, only with his arrival in England and the latter series of works spread throughout his life. Other compositions by him include operas, one of which (Die Bakchantinnen) was revived and recorded; an octet with the same instrumentation as Schubert's; piano and violin concertos (one of each); and a suite for violin and orchestra. Stylistically his earliest music, somewhat like that of Ernst Krenek, is in a harsh but recognisably tonal style; there is a definite second period of sorts around the time of the first two symphonies (1940s) in which his music has a somewhat Brucknerian sound ‚Äì in the symphonies sometimes an equal breadth, though still with something of a 20th-century feel and harmonies ‚Äì but after his fourth symphony (the Austriaca) his music is more tonally vague in character, with serial techniques used. This idiom is consistent with hints of tonality, such as can be found in his eighth string quartet. Grave of Egon Wellesz, his wife and other family members at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna Despite his composing, Wellesz remains best known for his extensive scholarly contributions to the study of Byzantine music. These contributions brought for him an honorary doctorate from Oxford (where he later taught) in 1932. A portrait was made of Wellesz by Jean Cooke, who had been commissioned for the work by Lincoln College, University of Oxford. Wellesz died in Oxford.  Music  Wellesz's works as a composer amount to at least 112 works with opus numbers as well as some 20 works without opus number. He busied himself in a variety of media. Rather than follow his teacher Schoenberg's Expressionist style, Wellesz found inspiration in music from the pre-modern era (with the exception of Mahler), becoming a forerunner to the anti-Romantic currents of the twenties. He wrote: > In place of the infinite melody, the finite must return, in the place of > dissolved, amorphous structures, clear, clearly outlined forms. The opera of > the future must tie in with the traditions of Baroque opera. This is the > natural form, the innermost essence of opera. Recently, interest in Wellesz's music has increased. A complete recording of his nine symphonies is available, although his music has generally been sparsely represented on CD or LP. His 3rd symphony (1950‚Äì1), published posthumously, received its world premiere in Vienna in 2000. Several of his symphonies have titles, including the second (The English), and the seventh (Contra torrentum). =Works for stage= * Das Wunder der Diana, op. 18 (1914‚Äì1917), ballet after B√©la Bal√°zs * Die Prinzessin Girnara, op. 27 (1919‚Äì1920), libretto by Jakob Wassermann * Persisches Ballett, op. 30 (1920), ballet after Ellen Tels * Achilles auf Skyros, op. 33 (1921), ballet after Hugo von Hofmannsthal * Alkestis, op. 35 (1924), Libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal after Euripides * Die N√§chtlichen: Tanzsinfonien, op. 37 (1924), Ballet scene after Max Terpis * Die Opferung des Gefangenen, op. 40 (1924‚Äì1925), Stage drama after Eduard Stucken * Scherz, List und Rache, op. 41 (1927), libretto after Johann Wolfgang von Goethe * Die Bakchantinnen, op. 44 (1931), libretto by the composer after Euripides, opera in 2 Acts * *Hymne der Agave aus Die Bakchantinnen, op. 44, concert edition by Wellesz * Incognita, op. 69 (1950), libretto by Elizabeth MacKenzie and William Congreve = Choral works = * Drei gemischte Ch√∂re, op. 43 (1930), text: Angelus Silesius * F√ºnf kleine M√§nnerch√∂re, op. 46 (1932) from Fr√§nkischen Koran by Ludwig Derleth * Drei geistliche Ch√∂re, op. 47 (1932) for men's chorus based on poems from Mitte des Lebens by Rudolf Alexander Schr√∂der * Zwei Ges√§nge, op. 48 (1932) based on poems from Mitte des Lebens by Rudolf Alexander Schr√∂der * Mass in F minor, op. 51 (1934) * Quant'√® bella Giovinezza, op. 59 (1937), for women's choir * Carol, op. 62a (1944) for women's choir * Proprium Missae, Laetare, op. 71 (1953) for choir and organ * Kleine Messe in G major, op. 80a (1958) for three similar voices a capella * Alleluia, op. 80b (1958) for soprano or tenor solo * Laus Nocturna, op. 88 (1962) * Missa brevis, op. 89 (1963) for choir * To Sleep, op. 94 (1965) for choir * Festliches Pr√§ludium, op. 100 (1966) on a Byzantinium Magnificat for choir and organ = Orchestral works = * Heldensang, op. 2 (1905), symphonic prologue for large orchestra * Vorfr√ºhling, op. 12 (1912), symphonic mood picture for orchestra * Suite, op. 16 (1913), for orchestra * Mitte des Lebens, op. 45 (1931‚Äì32), cantata for soprano, choir, and orchestra * Piano Concerto, op. 49 (1933) * Amor Timido, op. 50 (1933), aria for soprano and small orchestra, text: Pietro Metastasio * Prosperos Beschw√∂rungen, op. 53 (1934‚Äì36), five symphonic works for orchestra after William Shakespeares The Tempest * Lied der Welt, op. 54 (1936‚Äì38), for soprano and orchestra.

Seurat's most renowned masterpiece, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, marked the beginning of this movement when it first made its appearance at an exhibition of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants (Salon des Ind√©pendants) in Paris. Around this time, the peak of France's modern era emerged and many painters were in search of new methods. Followers of Neo-Impressionism, in particular, were drawn to modern urban scenes as well as landscapes and seashores. Science-based interpretation of lines and colors influenced Neo- Impressionists' characterization of their own contemporary art. The Pointillist and Divisionist techniques are often mentioned in this context, because it was the dominant technique in the beginning of the Neo- impressionist movement. Some argue that Neo-Impressionism became the first true avant-garde movement in painting. The Neo-Impressionists were able to create a movement very quickly in the 19th century, partially due to its strong connection to anarchism, which set a pace for later artistic manifestations. The movement and the style were an attempt to drive \\"harmonious\\" vision from modern science, anarchist theory, and late 19th- century debate around the value of academic art. The artists of the movement \\"promised to employ optical and psycho-biological theories in pursuit of a grand synthesis of the ideal and the real, the fugitive and the essential, science and temperament.\\" Overview =Principles of aesthetic: light and color= During the emergence of Neo-Impressionism, Seurat and his followers strove to refine the impulsive and intuitive artistic mannerisms of Impressionism. Neo-impressionists used disciplined networks of dots and blocks of color in their desire to instill a sense of organization and permanence. In further defining the movement, Seurat incorporated the recent explanation of optic and color perceptions. The development of color theory by Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul and others by the late 19th century played a pivotal role in shaping the Neo-Impressionist style. Ogden Rood's book, Modern Chromatics, with Applications to Art and Industry, acknowledged the different behaviors exhibited by colored light and colored pigment. While the mixture of the former created a white or gray color, that of the latter produced a dark, murky color. As painters, Neo-Impressionists had to deal with colored pigments, so to avoid the dullness, they devised a system of pure-color juxtaposition. Mixing of colors was not necessary. The effective utilization of pointillism facilitated in eliciting a distinct luminous effect, and from a distance, the dots came together as a whole displaying maximum brilliance and conformity to actual light conditions. =Origins of the term= There are a number of alternatives to the term \\"Neo-Impressionism\\" and each has its own nuance: Chromoluminarism was a term preferred by Georges Seurat. It emphasized the studies of color and light which were central to his artistic style. This term is rarely used today. Divisionism, which is more commonly used, is used to describe a mode of Neo-Impressionist painting. It refers to the method of applying individual strokes of complementary and contrasting colors. Unlike other designations of this era, the term 'Neo-Impressionism' was not given as a criticism. Instead, it embraces Seurat's and his followers' ideals in their approach to art. Note: Pointillism merely describes a later technique based on divisionism in which dots of color instead of blocks of color are applied. =The group of Neo-Impressionist painters= Paul Signac, 1890, Portrait of F√©lix F√©n√©on (in front of an enamel of a rhythmic background of measures and angles, shades and colors), oil on canvas, 73.7 √ó 92.5 cm (28.9 √ó 36.4 in.), Museum of Modern Art, New York Neo-Impressionism was first presented to the public in 1886 at the Salon des Ind√©pendants. The Ind√©pendants remained their main exhibition space for decades with Signac acting as president of the association. But with the success of Neo-Impressionism, its fame spread quickly. In 1886, Seurat and Signac were invited to exhibit in the 8th and final Impressionist exhibition, later with Les XX and La Libre Esth√©tique in Brussels. In 1892, a group of Neo-Impressionist painters united to show their works in Paris, in the Salons of the H√¥tel Br√©bant, 32, boulevard Poissonni√®re. The following year they exhibited at 20, rue Laffitte. The exhibitions were accompanied by catalogues, the first with reference to the printer: Imp. Vve Monnom, Brussels; the second refers to M. Moline, secretary. Pissarro and Seurat met at Durand-Ruel's in the fall of 1885 and began to experiment with a technique using tiny dots of juxtaposing colors. This technique was developed from readings of popular art history and aesthetics (the French administrator, Charles Blanc, and Swiss aesthetician, David Sutter), and manuals for the industrial and decorative arts, science of optics and perception. At this time Pissarro began to be involved with the coterie that helped found the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Independants in 1884. Some members of the group attended gatherings for naturalist and symbolist authors at the home of Robert Caze who was an ex-communard and radical Republican journalist. It was here that the painters got to know each other, and many showed their work at independents' shows for all their lives. Pissarro asked Seurat and Signac to participate in the eighth impressionist exhibit in May 1886. This is where A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte was shown. They had a separate room at the show. The Republicans' liberalization of press laws in 1881 also aided this avant-garde movement. It made it easier for people to begin their own newspapers, thus allowing more art critics to get published. Henri-Edmond Cross, The Evening Air (l'Air du soir), c. 1893, oil on canvas, 116 √ó 164 cm, Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris The idea of the \\"modern primitive\\" drew this group and began with Signac. After Seurat displayed La Grande Jatte, the critic F√©n√©on coined the term Neo-Impressionism. Pissarro, his son Lucien, and Signac also showed work at the same time. Soon other artists began to join the movement including Charles Angrand, Henri-Edmond Cross, Albert Dubois-Pillet, L√©o Gausson, Louis Hayet, and Maximilien Luce. The allure of the scientific and new techniques captivated the young artists of this movement. The movement then spread abroad when Seurat and Pissarro were invited to Les Vingt, an avant-garde society in Brussels. This style became the dominant form in Belgium by 1889 and even artists like Van Gogh tried their hand at this style. Seurat's mission as an artist was to celebrate the power of pure color, the expressive power of line, color and value, the reform of Impressionism and of the Beaux-Arts tradition. Seurat \\"wanted to be perceived as a technician of art, and so he borrowed from science some of the signs of its authority, including the regularity and clarity of pattern.\\" This can be compared to how Signac \\"saw and emphasized a connection between anarchism, the Neo- Impressionist technique, the Mediterranean location, and the classical tradition in painting\\". Signac also viewed the Mediterranean as the place for anarchist avant-garde art. The Mediterranean was rarely depicted by avant- garde painters partially because of the association between the south of France and academic classicism as well as cultural and political conservatism. By setting his pastorals in the south, Signac followed the literary examples of Stendhal and Guy de Maupassant, who linked the region with liberty. Stendhal \\"described the south as a place of freedom where the worst faults of capitalist society were less entrenched than in the north.\\" Stendhal also saw the South as a connection to other \\"Latin\\" countries who are \\"outside the civilized societies' concern for money.\\" =Evolution= This movement's peak years lasted about five years (1886‚Äì1891), but did not end with Georges Seurat's death in 1891. Impressionism continued to evolve and expand over the next decade with even more distinctive characteristics. Incorporation of political and social ideas, especially anarchism, started showing prominence. After Seurat's death by diphtheria and his friend Albert Dubois-Pillet's by smallpox in the previous year, the Neo-impressionists began to change and strengthen their image through social and political alliances. They forged links to the anarcho-communists movement and through this, many more young artists were attracted to this \\"blend of social and artistic theory\\". In the later 1890s Signac went back to his earlier belief in the visual harmony of the Neo-impressionist style, and the belief that it signified his ideals. He also emphasized that Neo-Impressionists were not seeking realism. They did not want to imitate, but instead have \\"the will to create the beautiful‚Ä¶. We are false, false like Corot, like Carri√®re, false, false! But we also have our ideal‚Äîto which it is necessary to sacrifice everything\\". This return to an earlier style was alienating and caused fissures and tensions within the previously tight-knit community of neo-impressionists. =Criticism= At the start of the movement, Neo-Impressionism was not welcomed by the art world and the general public. In 1886, Seurat's first exhibition of his now most famous work, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, inspired torrents of negative criticism. The commotion evoked by this artwork could only be described with words like \\"bedlam\\" and \\"scandal\\". Neo-Impressionists' use of small segments of color to compose a whole picture was considered even more controversial than its preceding movement; Impressionism had been notorious for its spontaneous representation of fleeting moments and roughness in brushwork. Neo-Impressionism provoked similar responses for opposite reasons. The meticulously calculated regularity of brush strokes was deemed to be too mechanical and antithetical to the commonly accepted notions of creative processes set for the 19th century. According to modern sources, much of the critique of the Neo-Impressionists at the time is just out of focus. In December 1894, the independent socialist daily La Petite R√©publique featured a front-page column by critic Adolphe Tabarant. He remarked on the new Neo- Impressionist cooperative gallery in the Rue Laffitte, focusing on Luce and Signac, also known as the young masters: \\"The art has, perhaps, a tendency toward an ill-tempered synthesis, toward a scientific observation that is too dry. But how it vibrates, and how it rings with truth! What an expenditure of coloring, what a profusion of agitated notions, in which one senses the noble and sincere passions of those young men who, after lamented Seurat, strive to capture all the secrets of light from the sun!\\" The Neo-Impressionists were supported from the beginning in 1884 by the Journal des Artistes. Other papers also discussed the future Neo-Impressionists together, thus showing that they had formed as a group through tier creation of a democratic exhibit space, not their movement or artistic style. After the turn of the century, the critic F√©lix F√©n√©on critiqued Signac‚Äôs idealism in his later work. He compared Signac to Claude and Poussin by saying that Claude Lorrain knew all the details of the real world, and that he was able to express the world contained it by his beautiful spirit. He relates Signac to an \\"inheritor of landscape tradition that envisioned the realm of harmony\\". Divisionism Divisionism (also called Chromo-luminarism) was the characteristic style in Neo-Impressionist painting defined by the separation of contrasting or complementing colors into individual patches which interacted optically to create shadow and dimension..Homer, William I. Seurat and the Science of Painting. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1964. By requiring the viewer to combine the colors optically instead of physically mixing pigments, Divisionists believed they were achieving the maximum luminosity that was scientifically possible. They also believed that it philosophically represented harmony as unanticipated colors work together equally to form a single image. Georges Seurat founded the style around 1884 as chromo-luminarism, drawing from his understanding of the scientific theories of Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul, Ogden Rood and Charles Blanc, among others. Divisionism developed alongside Pointillism, which is defined specifically by the use of dots of paint but does not primarily focus on the separation of colors.Ratliff, Floyd. Paul Signac and Color in Neo- Impressionism. New York: Rockefeller UP, 1992. . =Theoretical foundations and development= Divisionism developed in nineteenth-century painting as artists discovered scientific theories of vision which encouraged a departure from the tenets of Impressionism. Most notably as science surrounding the vibration of light and the effect on retinas developed, color palettes changed. Neo-Impressionists began to place complementary colors side-by-side to create dimension and shadows instead of working in a range of hues. This dividing up of the canvas into individual sections of complementary and contrasting colors led to the name \\"divisionism\\", a term coined by Signac. The scientific theories and rules of color contrast that would guide composition for Divisionists placed the movement of Neo-Impressionism in contrast with Impressionism, which is characterized by the use of instinct and intuition. Scientists and artists whose theories of light or color had some impact on the development of Divisionism include Charles Henry, Charles Blanc, David Pierre Giottino Humbert de Superville, David Sutter, Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul, Ogden Rood and Hermann von Helmholtz. =Georges Seurat= Georges Seurat, Le Cirque, 1891, oil on canvas, 185 x 152 cm, Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris Divisionism, along with the Neo-Impressionism movement as a whole, found its beginnings in Georges Seurat's masterpiece, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Seurat was classically trained in the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, and, as such, his initial works reflected the Barbizon style. Studying under Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Seurat intensely pursued interests in line and color, color theory, and optical effects, all of which formed the basis of Divisionism. In 1883, Seurat and some of his colleagues began exploring ways to express as much light as possible on the canvas.Sutter, Jean. The Neo Impressionists. Greenwich, CT: New York Graphic Society, 1970. . By 1884, with the exhibition of his first major work, Bathing at Asni√®res, as well as croquetons of the island of La Grande Jatte, Seurat's style began taking form with an awareness of Impressionism, but it was not until he finished La Grande Jatte in 1886 that he established his theory of chromo-luminarism. Although this painting was originally rejected by the official salon it attracted the Salon des Ind√©pendants where Paul Signac was engaged. Following the controversial success of La Grande Jatte, Camille Pissarro and Paul Signac converted to Neo-Impressionism and, along with Pissarro's son Lucien, formed the basis of the Neo-Impressionist and Divisionist movements. Later promoted by Symbolist artists and critics, Divisionism became the avant-garde style of post-Impressionism. The support Seurat initially received slowly dissipated as he became increasingly hostile towards other artists, believing that they were corrupting his style and technique. By the end of his life few works of his received the attention they used to. Circus, an unfinished work exhibited after his death, was barely noticed by critics or the general public. =Camille Pissarro= Camille Pissarro, born in 1830, is a notable radical artist and the only painter to exhibit in all eight Impressionist shows from 1874 to 1886. During Pissarro's long career he remained at the foreground of French avant-garde art, although his Neo-Impressionist phase is among his most popular and most studied. Pissarro studied under Fritz Melbye, spending the first 15 years of his career painting rural landscapes, market scenes and ports all of which make subject returns throughout his later career. During his Impressionist phase, Pissarro switched to a lighter brush stroke and a brighter color palette, frequently applied in sections of unmixed color. This style of Impressionism gave way to joining Seurat in Neo-Impressionism in 1885. He was the first convert to what is now called Divisionism. Pissarro developed what he called \\"scientific Impressionism\\" and later left the movement as a whole, finding the compositional rules too strict. =Paul Signac= Paul Signac, 1893, Femme √† l'ombrelle, oil on canvas, 81 x 65 cm, Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris Paul Signac, born in 1863, was Seurat's closest friend and the face of the Neo-Impressionist movement. He had no formal art training but was able to refine his skills through travel and replication as he was born into a family of financial stability. Signac was encouraged to remove earth tones from his palette by Seurat, and in turn introduced Seurat to Symbolism, jointly creating the Neo-Impressionist movement. He is also noted for initiating Vincent van Gogh, Th√©o Van Rysselberghe and Henry Van de Velde to the movement. In 1891, the year after Seurat's death, Signac began to introduce abstract visual rhythms and subjectivity into his works and by transit into Neo-Impressionism. Signac's creative experimentation inspired artists such as Matisse and Henri Edmond Cross to further define Neo- Impressionism in the 20th century. His knowledge of the movement lead to illustrating Charles Henry's Cerle Chromatique et Rapporteur Esth√©tique, a widely influential book on color theory and later to his authoring the manifesto of Neo-Impressionism, D‚ÄôEug√®ne Delacroix au N√©o-Impressionisme in 1899. =Color theory= Georges Seurat, 1889-90, Le Chahut, oil on canvas, 170 x 141 cm, Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum Charles Blanc's Grammaire des arts du dessin introduced Seurat to the theories of color and vision that would inspire chromo-luminarism. Blanc's work, drawing from the theories of Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul and Eug√®ne Delacroix, stated that optical mixing would produce more vibrant and pure colors than the traditional process of mixing pigments. Mixing pigments physically is a subtractive process with cyan, magenta, and yellow being the primary colors. On the other hand, if colored light is mixed together, an additive mixture results, a process in which the primary colors are red, green and blue. The optical mixture which characterized Divisionism‚Äîthe process of mixing color by juxtaposing pigments‚Äîis different from either additive or subtractive mixture, although combining colors in optical mixture functions the same way as additive mixture, i.e. the primary colors are the same. In reality, Seurat's paintings did not actually achieve true optical mixing; for him, the theory was more useful for causing vibrations of color to the viewer, where contrasting colors placed near each other would intensify the relationship between the colors while preserving their singular separate identity. In Divisionist color theory, artists interpreted the scientific literature through making light operate in one of the following contexts: * Local color: As the dominant element of the painting, local color refers to the true color of subjects, e.g. green grass or blue sky. * Direct sunlight: As appropriate, yellow-orange colors representing the sun's action would be interspersed with the natural colors to emulate the effect of direct sunlight. * Shadow: If lighting is only indirect, various other colors, such as blues, reds and purples, can be used to simulate the darkness and shadows. * Reflected light: An object which is adjacent to another in a painting could cast reflected colors onto it. * Contrast: To take advantage of Chevreul's theory of simultaneous contrast, contrasting colors might be placed in close proximity. Seurat's theories intrigued many of his contemporaries, as other artists seeking a reaction against Impressionism joined the Neo-Impressionist movement. Paul Signac, in particular, became one of the main proponents of divisionist theory, especially after Seurat's death in 1891. In fact, Signac's book, D‚ÄôEug√®ne Delacroix au N√©o-Impressionnisme, published in 1899, coined the term Divisionism and became widely recognized as the manifesto of Neo-Impressionism. =Divisionism in France and northern Europe= In addition to Signac, other French artists, largely through associations in the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants, adopted some Divisionist techniques, including Camille and Lucien Pissarro, Albert Dubois- Pillet, Charles Angrand, Maximilien Luce, Henri-Edmond Cross and Hippolyte Petitjean. Additionally, through Paul Signac's advocacy of Divisionism, an influence can be seen in some of the works of Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, Jean Metzinger, Robert Delaunay and Pablo Picasso.Rapetti Rodolphe Signac, Paul Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online Following the revolutions of 1848, a strong undercurrent of radical anarchism ran throughout the artistic community of France. The combination of social art and artistic freedom and the departure from traditional color painting techniques attracted radicals to the movement of Neo-Impressionism. However these radicals were often criticized for depicting a peaceful and thoughtful approach to social revolution, combining science and moral harmony. In 1907 Metzinger and Delaunay were singled out by the critic Louis Vauxcelles as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.Art of the 20th Century Both artists had develop a new sub-style that had great significance shortly thereafter within the context of their Cubist works. Piet Mondrian and Nico van Rijn, in the Netherlands, developed a similar mosaic- like Divisionist technique circa 1909. The Futurists later (1909‚Äì1916) would adapt the style, in part influenced by Gino Severini's Parisian experience (from 1907), into their dynamic paintings and sculpture.Robert Herbert, Neo- Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, 1968 =Divisionism in Italy= Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo, The Fourth Estate, 1899-1901. The influence of Seurat and Signac on some Italian painters became evident in the First Triennale in 1891 in Milan. Spearheaded by Grubicy de Dragon, and codified later by Gaetano Previati in his Principi scientifici del divisionismo of 1906, a number of painters mainly in Northern Italy experimented to various degrees with these techniques. These Italian artists merged Neo-impressionism with Symbolism creating allegorical paintings using a divisionist method. For example, Pellizza da Volpedo applied the technique to social (and political) subjects; in this he was joined by Angelo Morbelli and Emilio Longoni. Among Pellizza's Divisionist works were Speranze deluse (1894) and Il sole nascente (1904).Il Sole Nascente is in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna, Rome. It was, however, in the subject of landscapes that Divisionism found strong advocates, including Segantini, Previati, Morbelli, and Carlo Fornara. Further adherents in painting genre subjects were Plinio Nomellini, Rubaldo Merello, Giuseppe Cominetti, Angelo Barabino, Camillo Innocenti, Enrico Lionne, and Arturo Noci. Divisionism was also an important influence in the work of Futurists Gino Severini (Souvenirs de Voyage, 1911); Giacomo Balla (Arc Lamp, 1909);Arc Lamp is in the Museum of Modern Art, New York Carlo Carr√† (Leaving the scene, 1910); and Umberto Boccioni (The City Rises, 1910).The City Rises is also in the MoMADerived from paragraph in Associazione Pellizza da Volpedo , which cites Enciclopedia dell'arte, Milano (Garzanti) 2002, and also see Voci del Divisionismo italiano in Bollettino Anisa, N. 12 Anno XIX, n. 1, May 2000. =Criticism and controversy= Divisionism quickly received both negative and positive attention from art critics, who generally either embraced or condemned the incorporation of scientific theories in the Neo-Impressionist techniques. For example, Joris- Karl Huysmans spoke negatively of Seurat's paintings, saying \\"Strip his figures of the colored fleas that cover them, underneath there is nothing, no thought, no soul, nothing\\".Rewald, John. Seurat: a biography. New York: H.N. Abrams, 1990. . Leaders of Impressionism, such as Monet and Renoir, refused to exhibit with Seurat, and even Camille Pissarro, who initially supported Divisionism, later spoke negatively of the technique. While most Divisionists did not receive much critical approval, some critics were loyal to the movement, including notably F√©lix F√©n√©on, Ars√®ne Alexandre, and Antoine de la Rochefoucauld. Furthermore, Divisionists were often criticized for being too peaceful and logical in revolution. Because their color choices were often planned and scientifically constructed, they lacked the radical freedom that anarchists embodied. French anarchy, particularly after Haussmannization, placed an emphasis on a classless society but Divisionists, and all artists, reinforced classes through middle-class consumerism of their works. These conflicting ideals put Divisionism under the critical lens of radical anarchists. =Scientific misconceptions= Although Divisionist artists strongly believed their style was founded in scientific principles, some people believe that there is evidence that Divisionists misinterpreted some basic elements of optical theory.Lee, Alan. \\"Seurat and Science.\\" Art History 10 (June 1987): 203-24. For example, one of these misconceptions can be seen in the general belief that the Divisionist method of painting allowed for greater luminosity than previous techniques. Additive luminosity is only applicable in the case of colored light, not juxtaposed pigments; in reality, the luminosity of two pigments next to each other is just the average of their individual luminosities. Furthermore, it is not possible to create a color using optical mixture which could not also be created by physical mixture. Logical inconsistencies can also be found with the Divisionist exclusion of darker colors and their interpretation of simultaneous contrast.

She bore the name (pronounced with two equal syllables: ) of a butterfly fish, Chaetodon capistratus. Parche was built by the Portsmouth Navy Yard. Her keel was laid on 9 April 1943 and was christened on 24 July, when Betty Russell smashed the traditional bottle of champagne across the bow as she slid into the water for the first time. Russell was the daughter of the U.S. District Judge Robert Lee Russell, formerly Judge Advocate General of the Navy. Parche was commissioned on 20 November 1943 with Commander Lawson P. Ramage commanding. First and Second War Patrols On 29 March 1944 the submarine left Pearl Harbor with two other subs, and , for her first war patrol. After passing Midway Island, the three reached the sea lanes south of Formosa 16 April. On 29 April Bang reported a large convoy away, and the wolf pack attacked, Parche sinking one ship. Tinosa reported a seven-ship convoy on the morning of 3 May and Parche headed north at full speed to intercept. An hour after midnight Parche was in position and scored three torpedo hits on the leading ship and two hits on the second freighter, sinking both. Parche scored two hits on the third freighter, which settled by the stern and began to list to port. Post-war records credited the trio of submarines with five sinkings and 30,542 tons, Parche getting credit for Taiyoku Maru and Shoryu Maru. Parche returned to Midway 23 May 1944, after making a thorough photo reconnaissance of military installations on the island of Ishi Gaki Jima. Parche's second patrol was again south of Formosa, forming a coordinated attack group with and . Parche went to sea 17 June, following her refit. A week later she sighted and sank a patrol vessel with gunfire. On 4 July a Japanese cruiser and destroyer bombarded and depth charged Parche. Parche sighted a convoy 29 July and, cooperating with Steelhead, closed in, sinking 4,471 ton cargo ship Manko Maru and 10,238-ton tanker Koei Maru. During this night surface action Parche barely avoided being rammed by one ship. Parche collaborated with Steelhead in sinking an 8,990 ton transport, the Yoshino Maru (originally the Kleist, built in Danzig, 1906 for North German LLoyd, surrendered to the British in 1919, and acquired by the Nippon Yusen Kaisha in 1922.) Steelhead sank two other ships, a transport and a cargo vessel. Another tanker and a cargo ship were damaged. For this action Parche received the Presidential Unit Citation and her commander, Ramage, received the Medal of Honor. On 1 August the sub departed for Saipan where she moored 5 August, arriving Pearl Harbor 16 August. Third, Fourth, and Fifth War Patrols On her third war patrol, 10 September to 2 December, one of the longest of the war, Parche did not encounter any targets. After a refit, the ship got underway 30 December for rotating patrol in the Nansei Shoto. She discovered a freighter and a tanker at anchor in Naze Ko 19 January, firing six bow tubes at the tanker for five distinct hits and four stern tubes at the freighter for two possible hits. On 7 February Parche sighted and sank the 984-ton Okinoyama Maru. Fueling at Midway 16 February, the sub continued to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 20 February. Japanese shipping, decimated by continual submarine and air attacks, was becoming increasingly difficult to find. When Parche left Pearl Harbor 19 March 1945, she headed directly for the east coast of Honsh≈´, Japan. Parche sank escorting 615-ton Minesweeper No. 3 off Kobe Zaki 9 April. On 11 April Parche made a gun attack, sinking a small freighter of about 800 tons. She torpedoed another small vessel the next day. On 13 April Parche sank a fishing trawler. Two hours later she again opened fire on a small observation boat, leaving it blazing stem to stern. Two Japanese planes caused her to dive, leaving all her guns loose and much of her ammunition exposed. A heavy explosion shook her on the way down, but inflicted no damage. On 22 April Parche sighted three small tankers in column, proceeding north along the coast south of Okama Saki. Parche launched three torpedoes at the second tanker and then shifted to the third, which was left down by the stern covered with a cloud of smoke. The sub sailed for Midway, arriving 30 April. Sixth War patrol Parche got underway 25 May for her sixth patrol, the last of World War II, joining the ‚ÄúLifeguard League‚Äù south of Honsh≈´. She stayed on station off Honsh≈´ until 18 June, ready to pick up any aviators who might be forced down. No rescues were necessary, and on the 18th she proceeded to Tsugara Strait. Her first torpedo contact came 21 June when she sighted a gunboat rounding Shiriya Saki. The gunboat was soon joined by a sub chaser and then by a freighter. Picking the freighter as the best target, Parche launched four torpedoes from her forward tubes for one hit, which threw up a veil of dense white smoke. Expecting counter-measures, the sub went under, accompanied by the breaking-up noises of freighter Hizen Maru. Parche attacked three luggers escorted by a small flat vessel on the afternoon of the next day, and sank two. She sank several trawlers by gunfire on 23 June. Two days later she sighted three large ships and six escorts headed north along the coast, one of the most tempting convoys seen for some months in Japanese home waters. After Parche's attack the escorts shook the sub up considerably with depth charges four and a half hours, before she managed to work away and resume her patrol, leaving an ex-Gunboat sunk and another ship badly damaged. After another round of life guard duty for the carrier planes of Task Force 38, on 17 July, Parche rendezvoused with to take aboard three fliers, and set course for Midway, arriving 23 July, and mooring Pearl Harbor 28 July. One of the most highly decorated boats of the renowned World War II Pacific Submarine Force, USS Parche made six war patrols, earning five battle stars and one Presidential Unit Citation award for 2 war patrols. Post World War II operations After World War II Parche, was assigned to Operation Crossroads as a target ship for the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. Parche survived both the airburst and the underwater burst, coming through relatively undamaged. After decontamination, she proceeded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California. She was then decommissioned on 10 December 1946 and moved to join the reserve fleet Alameda, California in March 1947. On 1 December 1962 her classification was changed to Auxiliary Submarine, AGSS-384 and assigned as a Naval Reserve Training Submarine in Oakland, California. Parche's name was stricken from the Navy List on 8 November 1969, and she was sold on 18 June 1970 for scrap. All that remains of her is the original bridge structure, shears, and upper gun from the war which remain enshrined at the Naval Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor, and her conning tower barrel, which is on display at USS Bowfin Submarine Museum & Park, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

Liverpool F.C. He became Chairman on 18 September 1991. He owned 17,850 shares in Liverpool F.C. which represented 51% of the club. His uncle, Sir John Moores, was chairman of Everton where he was only a small shareholder. John Moores created Littlewoods and made the Moores family one of the wealthiest in the UK. Littlewoods was sold in 2002 for ¬£750m. The family owned their stake in Liverpool F.C. for over 50 years. However, Moores increasingly sought external investment to help Liverpool develop a new ground, and ended up selling it in 2007, to American investors Tom Hicks and George Gillett, in preference to Sheikh Mohammed and DIC. The deal turned sour soon after. In 2010, Moores said that \\"significant shareholders like Granada and Steve Morgan were insistent the board of Liverpool F.C. should accept the Gillett and Hicks offer and left me in no doubt about my legal duty to accept the offer\\". In a letter to The Times in May 2010, Moores admitted that he \\"hugely regrets\\" selling Liverpool to the American duo. Moores called on Gillett and Hicks to step aside and find a suitable buyer for the club. Moores wrote: \\"I call upon them now to stand back, accept their limitations as joint owners, acknowledge their role in the club's current demise, and stand aside, with dignity\\". Under the chairmanship of Moores, Liverpool had a turbulent period between 1991 and 1994 under manager Graeme Souness. When Moores sacked Souness in January 1994, it was the first time a Liverpool manager had been sacked since 1956. Moores said at the time that the decision to sack Souness was made because \\"the results have been well below what is expected by the club and its supporters.\\" Under Moores, Liverpool went through their most barren spell for three decades. Though they won the most club competitions over the sixteen years, this excluded the most prized English Premiership. As a result, Manchester United have now overtaken their championship total haul, and are close to their total haul for all major trophies, something which was unimaginable when Moores' tenure started. In 2005, Liverpool won a fifth UEFA Champions League after defeating A.C. Milan in the final. After the departure of Moores, Kenny Dalglish returned to the manager's position amid rumours that he had wanted to return in the mid-1990s, but was frustrated by the hesitancy and inconsistency of the decision-makers at Liverpool. Dalglish returned as manager in January 2011 but left the club at the end of the 2011-12 season. Personal life Moores's first wife Kathy Anders was a beauty queen and model, who became Miss England in 1974. She featured in TV advertisements for the Littlewoods Group, and married Moores in February 1976. After just 18 months of marriage, Anders died in a car crash in September 1977, aged 26, when Moores' Jaguar car overturned into a ditch on a quiet country road in Lancashire. Moores went to hospital with serious head injuries. It was the second family tragedy that year for the Moores family. Five months earlier in April 1977, Moores's elder brother Nigel died in a car crash in the South of France. Moores is currently married to wife Marjorie. Moores was the heir to the Littlewoods Business empire. Lady Grantchester, daughter of Sir John Moores was the family head which was ranked joint 32nd in the 2009 Sunday Times Rich List with assets worth ¬£1.2 bn. She died in February 2019.

He was the author of a lost work De Accentibus and of an extant treatise De Die Natali, written in 238, and dedicated to his patron Quintus Caerellius as a birthday gift. The contents are of a varied character: the natural history of man, the influence of the stars and genii, music, religious rites, astronomy, the doctrines of the Greek philosophers, and antiquarian subjects. The second part deals with chronological and mathematical questions, and has been of great service in determining the principal epochs of ancient history. The whole is full of curious and interesting information. The style is clear and concise, although somewhat rhetorical, and the ‚Äì for the period ‚Äì good. The chief authorities used were Varro and Suetonius. Some scholars, indeed, hold that the entire work is practically an adaptation of the lost Pratum of Suetonius. The fragments of a work De Naturali Institutione, dealing with astronomy, geometry, music, and versification, and usually printed with the De Die Natali of Censorinus, are not by him. Part of the original manuscript, containing the end of the genuine work, and the title and name of the author of the fragment are lost. A bright crater in the Sea of Tranquility on the Moon has been named after him.

It is the smallest of the main 18 islands, being less than a square kilometre (247 acres) in area, and is the only uninhabited one. The island can be seen from the villages of Hvalba and Sandv√≠k. Etymology The name means \\"Little D√≠mun\\", in contrast to St√≥ra D√≠mun, \\"Great D√≠mun\\". According to Fridtjof Nansen, D√≠mun may represent a pre- Norse, Celtic toponymic element meaning \\"double-neck\\". Stora and Litla D√≠mun shows a pairing of two distinctive but separate localities in one name. Gammeltoft concluded D√≠mun is a Scandinavian place name for a double-peaked feature of a particular appearance, reflecting a linguistic contact between Scandinavians and Gaels. Description The southern third of the island is sheer cliff, with the rest rising to the mountain of Sl√¶ttirnir, which reaches . The island is only inhabited by Faroe sheep and seabirds. Getting ashore is difficult, and can be performed only in perfect weather. The cliffs can be climbed with the aid of ropes placed by the owners of the sheep. =Important Bird Area= The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially European storm petrels (5000 pairs) and Atlantic puffins (10,000 pairs).BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Litla Dimun. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2012-02-23. There are no land animals beside sheep. History The island has never been inhabited by humans, but sheep were kept there from ancient times, being mentioned in the 13th-century work the F√¶reyinga Saga (Saga of the Faroese). The saga also features the island as the site of a battle between Brestur, father of Sigmundur, and G√∏tuskeggjar. The battle resulted in the death of Sigmund's father and his men and the deportation of Sigmund to Norway, where he befriended Olaf Tryggvasson, the King of Norway from 995 to 1000. The island used to be property of the Danish King, but it was difficult to get anyone to settle the island as it is very steep and hard to land at, and it was thus decided to sell it; it was mostly men from Hvalba who had used and rented the island until then. The auction was held in Hvalba on 24 July 1852, and the final bid was 4,820 Rigsdaler or 9,640 Dkk, quite a sum for the time. Men from Hvalba and Sandv√≠k together outbid the Factor for the royal sales-station in Tv√∏royri, who kept pushing the price up. The island was then given to the men from Hvalba and Sandv√≠k as Copyhold inheritance, against 40 Dkk in copyhold rent, and 10 Dkk every time there was a new owner. This money was in 1911 released with 1,000 Dkk, and thus did L√≠tla D√≠mun become the only privately owned island in the Faroes. =Shipwreck= In 1918 the Danish schooner Caspe, carrying a cargo of salt, was driven onto L√≠tla D√≠mun by a gale. The six crew were able to reach a narrow ledge just above the surf, but they had no stores, and the captain was severely injured. Eventually, they managed to move from the ledge, and found a cabin halfway up the island which had matches, fuel and a lamp. They caught two sheep and a sick bird, and were able to survive for seventeen days before being discovered and rescued by a fishing boat. One of the shipwrecked sailors eventually settled in the Faroes. Sheep The sheep now living on the island are Faroes sheep, but until the mid-nineteenth century it was occupied by feral sheep, probably derived from the earliest sheep brought to Northern Europe in the Neolithic Period. The last of these very small, black, short-wooled sheep were shot in the 1860s. They were similar in appearance and origin to the surviving Soay sheep, from the island of Soay in the St Kilda archipelago off the west coast of Scotland. Soay is an island of very similar size and topography to L√≠tla D√≠mun, and has similarly difficult access. The modern Faroes sheep of the island are gathered each autumn. People sail to the island in a fishing boat, towing several rowing skiffs. About 40 people then form a chain across the island, driving the 200 or so sheep into a pen on the north side of the island. The sheep are then caught, restrained by tying their feet together, put in nets five at a time and lowered by ropes to the skiffs. Each skiff then takes its load of 15 sheep to the fishing boat, which returns to the island of Su√∞uroy.

Commentators have opined that the piece's purpose is satirical ‚Äì that \\"[its] harmonic and rhythmic gaffes serve to parody the work of incompetent composers\\" ‚Äì though Mozart himself is not known to have revealed his actual intentions. Structure and compositional elements 233px The piece consists of four movements and takes about 20 minutes to perform. # Allegro (sonata form), F major # Menuetto and trio, F major (trio in B-flat major) # Adagio cantabile, C major # Presto (sonata rondo form), F major Compositorial comedic devices include: *secondary dominants replacing necessary subdominant chords; *discords in the horns; *parallel fifths *whole tone scales in the violin's high register; *clumsy orchestration, backing a thin melodic line with a heavy, monotonous accompaniment in the last movement; *going to the wrong keys for a sonata-form structure (the first movement, for example, never succeeds in modulating to the dominant, and simply jumps there instead after a few failed attempts); *starting the slow movement in the wrong key (G major instead of C major); *a pathetic attempt at a fugato, also in the last movement. The piece is notable for one of the earliest known uses of polytonality (though not the earliest, being predated by Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber's Battalia), creating the gesture of complete collapse at the finale. This may be intended to produce the impression of grossly out-of-tune string playing, since the horns alone conclude in the tonic key. The lower strings behave as if the tonic has become B-flat, while the violins and violas switch to G major, A major and E-flat major, respectively. Whole-tone scales and polytonality are foreign to music of the Classical era. However, these became common for early 20th-century composers like Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky, who were searching for a new musical language. In this later context, these were legitimate new techniques in serious music. In Mozart's time, however, these non-classical elements gave the piece its comedy, expressing the composer's humor. Translation The title A Musical Joke might be a poor rendering of the German original: Spa√ü does not necessarily connote the jocular, for which the word Scherz would more likely be used. In Fritz Spiegl's view, a more accurate translation would be Some Musical Fun. The sometimes-mentioned nicknames \\"Dorfmusikantensextett\\" (\\"village musicians' sextet\\") and \\"Bauernsinfonie\\" (\\"farmers' symphony\\") were added after Mozart's death. Other uses A version by Waldo de los R√≠os of the opening of the finale was used for many years as the theme tune to the BBC's Horse of the Year Show and other televised show jumping events.

Ufton Nervet has an elected civil parish council. Geography Ufton Nervet is a strip parish about long and up to wide, running roughly north-northwest ‚Äì south-southeast between the Kennet valley and the crest of low hills in its south. It is bounded to the north by the A4 road, to the south by a minor road linking Burghfield and Tadley, and to the west and east by a mixture of field boundaries and minor roads. It includes a section of the River Kennet, the Kennet Navigation and the railway between Reading and Taunton. Ufton Nervet village is a clustered one close to the parish's eastern boundary, less than a mile from Burghfield Common and Sulhamstead. Two minor roads link the village with the A4, crossing the canal and the railway line in the valley bottom. Both lanes cross the canal by swing bridges. The larger, Tyle Mill Road, passes through part of Sulhamstead and crosses the railway by a bridge. The smaller, Ufton Lane, passes through Ufton Green and used to cross the railway by an infamous level crossing, which was replaced by a bridge in December 2016. Other lanes link the village with Burghfield Common, Sulhamstead Abbots and Mortimer. Its direct link with Padworth to the west is a footpath past Ufton Court; the only road links with Padworth are circuitous ones via the southern or northern edges of the parish. Archaeology Excavation of a site at Ufton Green found a number of scattered Mesolithic stone artefacts. They are interpreted as evidence of stone-working to make tools or weapons. Manor Moat of the former Ufton Robert manor house Ufton Court The toponym \\"Ufton\\" is derived from the Old English Uffa-t≈´n = \\"Uffa's farmstead\\"; the Domesday Book of 1086 records it as Offetune. Three manors have existed in this area: Ufton Robert, Ufton Nervet and Ufton Pole. The Domesday Book records the first two. The original Ufton Nervet, also called Ufton Richard, was about northwest of the current village, at the current site of Ufton Green. It had its own parish church of St John the Baptist, the ruined west wall of which survives and is a scheduled monument. The place was named after Richard Neyrvut, later corrupted to Nervet, who held the manor in the 13th century. Ufton Robert manor house was just west of the current village. Its moat and a set of three medieval fishponds survive and are also a scheduled monument. An artificial stream, controlled by a set of sluices, fed the moat and ponds. Excavations in the 19th century found bridge piles, a gateway and other foundations. The Perkyns family held the manor from about 1411. When they bought the manor of Ufton Pole in 1560 they merged the two manors and moved the main residence to Ufton Pole. This is now Ufton Court, a large Elizabethan manor house about southwest of the village. The house was built in about 1568, altered in the 17th and 18th centuries, restored in 1838 and is now a Grade I listed building. In 1434‚Äì35 the parishes of Ufton Nervet and Ufton Robert were merged and Ufton Robert's parish church of St Peter was made the church of the merged parish. Although the original parish of Ufton Nervet had ceased to exist, this eventually became the name of the current village and parish. After the merger, Ufton Robert's parish church of St John the Baptist fell into decay, but its west wall survived by being adopted as the dividing wall between two cottages. In 1886 the cottages were demolished, re- exposing the west wall which now stands isolated in a pasture. Parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint Peter was built in 1862 on the site of an earlier church. It is a Gothic Revival rendition of 14th- century Decorated Gothic. The walls are predominantly rag-stone with ashlar dressings. It has a chancel, north chapel (used as an organ chamber), nave of three bays, west tower with tall octagonal shingled spire, and south porch. The present St Peter's contains church monuments salvaged from the old church. They include one to Richard Perkins (died 1560) with Corinthian columns, one to Francis and Anna Perkyns (died 1615‚Äì16 and 1635) with recumbent effigies and a brass to William and Constantia Smith (died 1627 and 1610). St Peter's has stained glass windows from two London makers: Charles Clutterbuck and Lavers and Barraud. In front of the porch is a mature yew tree. The church is redundant as its ecclesiastical parish church is today that of Sulhamstead Abbots and Bannister with Ufton Nervet which is in the upper part of Sulhamstead.Parish Finder The Church of England. Retrieved 16 December 2014 Economic history The River Kennet flows through the north of the parish. Between 1718 and 1723 it was made navigable by digging a series of cuts controlled by locks. One cut starts about downstream from Aldermaston and ends at Ufton Bridge, where it was controlled by Ufton Lock. The lock gates have now been removed but the lock chamber survives. Between 1794 and 1810 the Kennet and Avon Canal was built from Newbury to Bath. The Kennet Navigation is now managed as part of the canal. The Berks line of the Berks and Hants Railways from to was built through the north of the parish and opened in 1847. The nearest station remains , by road. Rail crash The Ufton Nervet crash took place in the parish on 6 November 2004. Seven people were killed and 70 injured when the 17:35 1C92 from London to which passes through was partially derailed by colliding with a stationary car on the level crossing, before subsequently passing over a set of points for the Down Goods Loop at Towney, causing a major derailment. The level crossing, called Ufton (but more commonly known as Ufton Nervet) was of the Automatic Half-Barrier type, positioned on Ufton Lane approximately 300 yards (300 metres) from the junction with the A4. Between the Railway's opening in 1847 and 1977, the level crossing had traditional, hand-operated wooden gates manned by a crossing keeper in Ufton Crossing Signal Box. The Ufton Crossing Act was passed in September 1977 which permitted the installation of Automatic Half Barriers of the Post-Hixon design. Road deaths at the crossing after the major crash in 2004 have followed in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2014, bringing the total number of fatalities to eleven. On 18 April 2016, work began on constructing a single-carriageway bridge over the railway, at a cost of ¬£7 million. It was completed and opened on 16 December 2016, with the level crossing out of bounds by a metal fence, its road lights off and barriers lowered. The equipment was decommissioned shortly afterwards.

Life =Early years= His birthplace in Ruppersthal, Lower Austria, now the Pleyel Museum He was born in in Lower Austria, the son of a schoolmaster named Martin Pleyl. He was the 24th of 38 children in the family. While still young, he probably studied with Johann Baptist Vanhal, and from 1772 he became the pupil of Joseph Haydn in Eisenstadt. As with Beethoven, born 13 years later, Pleyel benefited in his study from the sponsorship of aristocracy, in this case Count Ladislaus Erd≈ëdy (1746‚Äì1786). Pleyel evidently had a close relationship with Haydn, who considered him to be a superb student. Among Pleyel's apprentice work from this time was a puppet opera Die Fee Urgele, (1776) performed in the marionette theater at the palace of Eszterh√°za and in Vienna. Pleyel apparently also wrote at least part of the overture of Haydn's opera Das abgebrannte Haus, from about the same time. Pleyel's first professional position may have been as Kapellmeister for Count Erd≈ëdy, although this is not known for certain. Among his early publications was a set of six string quartets, his Opus 1. In the early 1780s, Pleyel visited Italy, where he composed an opera (Ifigenia in Aulide) and works commissioned by the king of Naples, Ferdinand I. =Strasbourg 1783‚Äì1795= Strasbourg Cathedral Attracted to the benefits associated with an organist position, Pleyel moved to Strasbourg, France in 1783 to work alongside Franz Xaver Richter, the ma√Ætre de chapelle at the Strasbourg Cathedral.Mathorez, Jules. Les Allemands, les Hollandais, les Scandinaves. Histoire de la formation de la population fran√ßaise : les √©trangers en France sous l'ancien r√©gime, 2. Paris: Champion, 1921. The cathedral was extremely appealing to Pleyel as it possessed a full orchestra, a choir, and a large budget devoted to performances.Tiersot, Julien. Histoire de la Marseillaise. Paris: Librairie Delagrave, 1915. After establishing himself in France, Pleyel voluntarily called himself by the French version of his name, Ignace. While he was the assistant ma√Ætre de chapelle at Strasbourg Cathedral, he wrote more works than during any other period in his musical career (1783‚Äì1793).Sitzmann, √âdouard. Dictionnaire de biographie des hommes c√©l√®bres de l'Alsace depuis les temps les plus recul√©s jusqu'√† nos jours, 2. Rixheim: Sutter, 1909. At the cathedral, he would organize concerts that featured his symphonies concertantes and liturgical music.Tiersot 1915. After Richter's death in 1789, Pleyel assumed the function of full ma√Ætre de chapelle. In 1788 Pleyel married Fran√ßoise-Gabrielle Lefebvre, the daughter of a Strasbourg carpet weaver. The couple had four children, the eldest being their son Camille. Maria Pleyel, n√©e Moke (1811‚Äì1875), the wife of Camille, was one of the most accomplished pianists of her time. In 1791, the French Revolution abolished musical performances in church as well as public concerts. Seeking alternative employment, Pleyel traveled to London, where he led the \\"Professional Concerts\\" organized by Wilhelm Cramer. In this capacity Pleyel inadvertently played the role of his teacher's rival, as Haydn was at the same time leading the concert series organized by Johann Peter Salomon. Although the two composers were rivals professionally, they remained on good terms personally. Just like Haydn, Pleyel made a fortune from his London visit. On his return to Strasbourg, he bought a large house, the moated Ch√¢teau d'Ittenwiller , about 35 km south, between nearby Saint-Pierre and Eichhoffen in the Bas-Rhin department. With the onset of the Reign of Terror in 1793 and 1794, life in France became dangerous for many, not excluding Pleyel. He was brought before the Committee of Public Safety a total of seven times due to the following: his foreign status, his recent purchase of a ch√¢teau, and his ties with the Strasbourg Cathedral.Honegger 1987 He was subsequently labeled a Royalist collaborator. The outcome of the committee's attentions could easily have been imprisonment or even execution. With prudent opportunism, Pleyel preserved his future by writing compositions in honor of the new republic. All were written in Strasbourg at times surrounding the Terror. Below are the pieces composed with dates of publication and details: #La Prise de Toulon (\\"The capture of Toulon\\") for solo and 3 voice choir with piano accompaniment. (19 February 1794) #Hymne de Pleyel chant√© au Temple de la Raison (\\"Hymn sung in the Temple of Reason\\") for choir with piano accompaniment. (1793 or 1794; dates disputed) #Hymne √† l'√ätre Supr√™me (\\"Hymn to the Supreme Being\\") two part cantata (performed 8 June 1794) #La R√©volution du 10 ao√ªt (\\"The Revolution of August 10\\") for soloists, choir, and orchestra (10 August 1794)The dates of the composition were originally given in the French revolutionary calendar. 19 February 1794 was the 1st of Ventose; 8 June 1791 was 20 Prairial, and 10 August 1794 was 23 Thermidor. All were in revolutionary Year II. Most of these compositions debuted at the Strasbourg Cathedral, which was known at the time as the Temple de l'√ätre Supr√™me (Temple of the Supreme Being), as churches were outlawed during the Terror. Pleyel became a naturalized French citizen and thus came to be known as Citoyen (citizen) Pleyel. With his involvement in artistic propaganda and loyalism to the new regime, Pleyel can be seen as the ultimate musical champion of Strasbourg republicanism. In addition to composing the above works for the Strasbourg public, Pleyel also contributed to the Parisian music scene during the Revolution. One example is Le Jugement de P√¢ris, a pantomime-ballet by Citoyen (Citizen) Gardel and performed with Pleyel's music (along with that of Haydn, and √âtienne M√©hul) on 5 March 1793.Tourneux, Maurice. Bibliographie de l'histoire de Paris pendant la r√©volution fran√ßaise 3. Monuments, moeurs et institutions. Paris: Impr. Nouvelle, 1900. =Pleyel as businessman= Pleyel moved to Paris in 1795. In 1797 he set up a business as a music publisher (\\"Maison Pleyel\\"), which among other works produced a complete edition of Haydn's string quartets (1801), as well as the first miniature scores for study (the Biblioth√®que Musicale, \\"musical library\\"). The publishing business lasted for 39 years and published about 4,000 works during this time, including compositions by Adolphe Adam, Luigi Boccherini, Ludwig van Beethoven, Muzio Clementi, Johann Baptist Cramer, Johann Ladislaus Dussek, Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Georges Onslow. Pleyel visited Vienna on business in 1805, meeting his now elderly mentor Haydn for a final time and hearing Beethoven play. In 1807, Pleyel became a manufacturer of pianos; for more on the Pleyel piano firm, see Pleyel et Cie. =Old age= Pleyel retired in 1824 and moved to the countryside about 50 km outside Paris. He died in 1831, apparently quite aware that his own musical style had been fully displaced by the new Romanticism in music. He was buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Pleyel's music Pleyel was prolific, composing at-least 42 symphonies, 70 string quartets and several operas. Many of these works date from the Strasbourg period; Pleyel's production tailed off after he had become a businessman. Recent scholarship has suggested that the theme for the Variations on a Theme by Haydn, by Johannes Brahms, Op. 56a, was probably composed not by Haydn but by Ignaz Pleyel. Pleyel also wrote music for masonic rituals.* Hill, Cecil (1980). \\"Masonic music\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. Stanley Sadie, vol. 11, 753-756 Reputation and assessment Pleyel is one instance of the phenomenon of a composer (others include Cherubini, Meyerbeer, and Thalberg) who was very famous in his own time but currently obscure. Keefe (2005) describes a \\"craze for his music c. 1780‚Äì1800\\", and quotes a number of contemporary witnesses to this surge. For instance Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis wrote, \\"What composer ever created more of a craze than Pleyel? Who enjoyed a more universal reputation or a more absolute domination of the field of instrumental music? Over more than twenty years, there was no amateur or professional musician who did not delight in his genius.\\"Keefe (2005, vii) Pleyel's fame even reached the then-remote musical regions of America: there was a Pleyel Society on the island of Nantucket off the coast of Massachusetts, and tunes by Pleyel made their way into the then- popular shape note tunebooks. Pleyel's work is twice represented in the principal modern descendant of these books, The Sacred Harp. In his own time, Pleyel's reputation rested at least in part on the undemanding character of his music. A reviewer writing in the Morning Herald of London (1791) said that Pleyel \\"is becoming even more popular than his master [Haydn], as his works are characterized less by the intricacies of science\\"Science\\" was often used at the time to mean \\"sophisticated knowledge\\", rather than in its more narrow modern sense. than the charm of simplicity and feeling.\\" In the mid 20th century, the harpsichord builder Wolfgang Zuckermann reminisced about playing Pleyel in his childhood in the 1930s: \\"When I was ten years old, my family string quartet played a lot of Pleyel since it was the only thing easy enough to keep us going. My cello part consisted of unending stretches of quarter notes played on open strings.\\"Zuckermann, Wolfgang (1969) The Modern Harpsichord. New York: October House, p. 162. Pleyel continues to be known today as a composer of didactic music: generations of beginning violin and flute students, for example, learn to play the numerous duets he wrote for those instruments. Pleyel pianos and Salle Pleyel The piano firm Pleyel et Cie was founded by Ignace Pleyel and continued by Pleyel's son Camille (1788‚Äì1855), a piano virtuoso who became his father's business partner as of 1815. The firm provided pianos used by Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, and also ran a concert hall, the Salle Pleyel, in which Chopin performed his first‚Äîand also his last‚ÄîParis concerts.

Older (Before HTML5) Techniques  =Adobe Flash= Adobe Flash manipulates vector and raster graphics to provide animation of text, drawings, and still images. It supports bidirectional streaming of audio and video, and it can capture user input via mouse, keyboard, microphone, and camera. Flash contains an object-oriented language called ActionScript and supports automation via the JavaScript Flash language (JSFL). Flash content may be displayed on various computer systems and devices, using Adobe Flash Player, which is available free of charge for common web browsers, some mobile phones and a few other electronic devices (using Flash Lite). Apache Flex, formerly Adobe Flex, is a software development kit (SDK) for the development and deployment of cross-platform RIAs based on the Adobe Flash platform. Initially developed by Macromedia and then acquired by Adobe Systems, Flex was donated by Adobe to the Apache Software Foundation in 2011. =Java applet= Java applets were used to create interactive visualizations and to present video, three dimensional objects and other media. Java applets were appropriate for complex visualizations that required significant programming effort in a high level language or communications between applet and originating server. =JavaFX= JavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering RIAs that can run across a wide variety of connected devices. The current release (JavaFX 12, March 11 2019) enables building applications for desktop, browser and mobile phones and comes with 3D support. TV set-top boxes, gaming consoles, Blu-ray players and other platforms are planned. Java FX runs as plug-in Java applet or via Webstart. =Microsoft Silverlight= Silverlight was proposed by Microsoft as another proprietary alternative. The technology has not been widely accepted and, for instance, lacks support on many mobile devices. Some examples of application were video streaming for events including the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, and the 2008 conventions for both major political parties in the United States. Silverlight was also used by Netflix for its instant video streaming service. Silverlight is no longer under active development and is not supported in Microsoft Edge, Microsoft's most recent browser. =Other techniques= RIAs could use XForms to enhance their functionality. Using XML and XSLT along with some XHTML, CSS and JavaScript can also be used to generate richer client side UI components like data tables that can be resorted locally on the client without going back to the server. Mozilla and Internet Explorer browsers both support this. History The terms \\"rich client\\" and \\"rich Internet application\\" were introduced in a white paper of March 2002 by Macromedia (now Adobe),Macromedia Flash MX‚ÄîA next-generation rich client though the concept had existed for a number of years earlier under names including: \\"Remote Scripting\\" by Microsoft in April 1999, \\"X Internet\\" by Forrester Research in October 2000, Rich Web application. Security issues in older standards RIAs present indexing challenges to Web search engines, but Adobe Flash content is now at least partially indexable. Security can improve over that of application software (for example through use of sandboxes and automatic updates), but the extensions themselves remain subject to vulnerabilities and access is often much greater than that of native Web applications. For security purposes, most RIAs run their client portions within a special isolated area of the client desktop called a sandbox. The sandbox limits visibility and access to the file-system and to the operating system on the client to the application server on the other side of the connection. This approach allows the client system to handle local activities, reformatting and so forth, thereby lowering the amount and frequency of client-server traffic, especially versus client-server implementations built around so-called thin clients.Living in the RIA World: Blurring the Line Between Web and Desktop Security, 2008 HTML5 trend In November 2011, there were a number of announcements that demonstrated a decline in demand for rich internet application architectures based on plug-ins in order to favor HTML5 alternatives. Adobe announced that Flash would no longer be produced for mobile or TV (refocusing its efforts on Adobe AIR). Pundits questioned its continued relevance even on the desktop and described it as \\"the beginning of the end\\". Research In Motion (RIM) announced that it would continue to develop Flash for the PlayBook, a decision questioned by some commentators. Rumors state that Microsoft is to abandon Silverlight after version 5 is released. The combination of these announcements had some proclaiming it \\"the end of the line for browser plug-ins\\".

Biography =The Rasmus= When he and Heinonen started at Suutarila high school in the early 1990s, they met Pauli Rantasalmi and later Janne Heiskanen. Yl√∂nen initiated the project of The Rasmus (then called just \\"Rasmus\\") in 1994, along with Eero Heinonen (bass) Pauli Rantasalmi (guitar), and Jarno Lahti (drums), with Lahti subsequently being replaced by Heiskanen. First, they called themselves Trashmosh, then Anttila, and at last Rasmus. They played their very first show before the winter break in school, 1994. They played songs with a style of rock and funk. Yl√∂nen became the lead singer, composer and songwriter of the band. He quit school because the band took too much of his time. In 1998, after having released three albums, Janne Heiskanen left and in 1999 Aki Hakala became The Rasmus' new drummer. In the same year, the band's former manager Teja Kotilainen left their current record label, Warner Music Finland. The band signed to Playground Music Scandinavia soon afterwards. =Dynasty= In 1999, an association called Dynasty was founded. The association consists of the three Finnish bands The Rasmus, Killer, and Kwan. The purpose of Dynasty was to signify allegiance and friendship between the bands and their members. Many members have tattoos or wear the Dynasty logotype on guitar straps. The bands have often worked together musically. Lauri has the tattoo on his arm as well as Pauli, Pauli also got the dynasty logo on his guitar (ESP LTD). =Side projects= Lauri sang co-vocals with Siiri Nordin, the singer of Killer, on a b-side version of the group's single, \\"All I Want\\". In 2004, Yl√∂nen recorded a song together with Apocalyptica and HIM's singer Ville Valo, named \\"Bittersweet\\". The song is available on Apocalyptica's self-titled album, Apocalyptica. It has also been released as a single and music video. A year later, he released another song with Apocalyptica, named \\"Life Burns!\\". This song was also released as a single and music video. The musical genre was much heavier than \\"Bittersweet.\\" \\"Life Burns!\\" is taken from the same album as \\"Bittersweet\\" Yl√∂nen also sang, with other members Kwan and Siiri Nordin of Killer, a song called \\"Chillin' at the Grotto\\" at a gala. Yl√∂nen's most recent project was composing the soundtrack of the Finnish movie \\"Blackout\\". The soundtrack was released in December 2008. =Solo career= Most recently, Yl√∂nen announced a solo album scheduled for release in March 2011 with the first single Heavy being out in February. The material will have its premiere at Emma Gala on February 26, 2011. Yl√∂nen stated that he wanted several songs, that did not fit The Rasmus, to be released as a major record rather than a demo or something like that. The album will be self-produced with his record label Dynasty Recordings. In February 2011 the title of the album was revealed, New World. It was later released on 30 March 2011 in Finland, with other European countries following. The first single was called Heavy, the video was shot by Owe Lingvall who had previously directed the singles Justify and October & April for The Rasmus. In May 2011 Lauri stated that In The City\\" would be the second single from his debut album. The video was shot in Las Vegas. Throughout the summer Lauri toured the Finnish summer festivals and even a few European countries, his next stop was Germany in September 2011. In late September it was revealed that a remixed version of What Are You Waiting For would be his next single. Yl√∂nen announced via his official website that he would continue his European tour starting with two dates in Russia for 2012. Recently he was nominated for best Finnish Act for the MTV EMA'S 2011. He subsequently won this category and went on to be nominated in the Best Worldwide Act. =Personal life= He has a son named Julius, born in April 2008, with Finnish singer Paula Vesala whom he married on 8 November 2014 in Las Vegas. The couple filed a statement on 29 December 2014 and the marriage was registered in Helsinki, January 5, 2015. The family moved to Los Angeles in autumn 2014. In September 2016 it was reported that the couple had filed for divorce after being together for 12 years. Yl√∂nen is currently in a domestic partnership with a Finnish model Katriina Mikkola. The couple has one child together, a son born named Oliver in December 2017. The family resides in Hawaii.

He composed scores for 50 films during the interwar period in Poland and 60 more in the United States. He composed dozens of hits for revue-theatres and films including Mi≈Ço≈õƒá ci wszystko wybaczy (Love Will Forgive You Everything) sung by Hanka Ordon√≥wna, Um√≥wi≈Çem siƒô z niƒÖ na dziewiƒÖtƒÖ (I Have a Date with Her at Nine) and Sex Appeal sung by Eugeniusz Bodo, Ach, jak przyjemnie (Ah, How Lovely!) and Ju≈º nie zapomnisz mnie (Now, You Will Remember Me) sung by Aleksander ≈ªabczy≈Ñski. Wars also composed symphonies, now obscure though available on the Internet, as is his Piano Concerto of 1948. After emigrating to the United States in 1947, he changed his name to Henry Vars. He was a friend of John Wayne.  Biography  Wars was born to a Jewish musical family in the Russian partition of Poland. He began studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, but soon obtained a scholarship to the Music Conservatory in Warsaw, from which he graduated in 1925, having studied composition with Professor Roman Statkowski and Emil M≈Çynarski. He was a long-time music director for Syrena Rekord.Fater, Isaschar (1970). Jewish Music in Poland between the Two World Wars, p. 296 In 1927 he composed a song called New York Times (\\"I do nothing all day but read the New York Times\\") that was sung in the Karuzela (Merry-Go-Round) Theatre by Tadeusz Olsza and recorded by Henryk Gold's Orchestra for Syrena Rekord. His first big hit, though, was Zata≈Ñczmy tango (Let's Dance a Tango), composed in 1928 for Stanis≈Çawa Nowicka and Eugeniusz Bodo. He was hired as a pianist for the Morskie Oko theater and joined Henryk Gold's band. During the 1930s, he composed songs for a string of musical comedies in Poland, and his importance there is comparable to that of Irving Berlin in America. His melodies from this period (along with those of Jerzy Petersburski and Zygmunt Wiehler) are still quite popular in Poland to this day, with his most popular songs often associated with pre-war Lw√≥w. Recent recordings include Ach, ≈õpij kochanie (Ah, Sleep My Darling) by Grzegorz Turnau and others, as well as many performances of Tylko we Lwowie. In 2002, the song Um√≥wi≈Çem siƒô z niƒÖ na dziewiƒÖtƒÖ (I have a date with her at nine) appeared in The Pianist directed by Roman Pola≈Ñski. He composed his first film score for Na Sybir in 1930, after gaining fame as a conductor and performer at various Warsaw cabarets and theaters including Morskie Oko, Hollywood, and Wielka Rewia. He composed scores for Pawe≈Ç i Gawe≈Ç, Szpieg w masce (A Masked Spy), Piƒôtro wy≈ºej (Upstairs), and Zapomniana melodia (A Forgotten Tune) films. \\"He was the pioneer of swing music in Poland.\\" Shortly before the outbreak of World War II, he was drafted into the Polish Army and served in the defense of Poland in 1939. He was taken prisoner of war by the German army but managed to escape from a stopped train. He organized the big band Tea-Jazz in Soviet-occupied Lw√≥w in 1940. He composed his first symphony at this time. In late 1941, he and his musicians joined the Polish II Corps of General Anders as part of the Polska Parada cabaret. After being demobilized from the army in 1947, he emigrated to the US. In the US, he changed his name to Henry Vars and after a period of struggling and poverty, managed to resume his musical career. He was John Wayne's friend. His songs were sung by such well-known stars as Margaret Whiting, Bing Crosby, Doris Day, Brenda Lee and Dinah Shore. He composed the score and the title song for the Flipper movie and television series, as well as Daktari. He also composed score for the 1956 western film Gun the Man Down.

Early life  Nogaret was born in Saint-F√©lix-Lauragais, Haute-Garonne. The family held a small ancestral property of servile origin at Nogaret, near Saint-F√©lix-de-Caraman (today's Saint-F√©lix-Lauragais), from which it took its name. In 1291 Guillaume was professor of jurisprudence at the university of Montpellier, and in 1296 he became a member of the Curia Regis at Paris. From 1306, he was a seigneur of Marsillargues, Calvisson, Aujargues and Cong√©nies in Languedoc.  Councillor to Philip IV  His name is mainly connected with the quarrel between Philip IV and Pope Boniface VIII. In 1300 he was sent with an embassy to Boniface, of which he left a picturesque and highly coloured account. His influence over the king dates from February 1303, when he persuaded Philip to consent to the bold plan of seizing Boniface and bringing him forcibly from Italy to a council in France meant to depose him. On 7 March he received, with three others, a secret commission from the royal chancery to \\"go to certain places ... and make such treaties with such persons as seemed good to them.\\" On 12 March a solemn royal assembly was held in the Louvre, at which Guillaume de Nogaret read a long series of accusations against Boniface and demanded the calling of a general council to try him. Attack on the Pope Soon afterwards he went to Italy. By the aid of a Florentine spy, Nogaret gathered a band of adventurers and of enemies of the Gaetani (Boniface's family) in the Apennines. The great Colonna house, in a bitter feud with the Gaetani, was his strongest ally, and Sciarra Colonna accompanied Nogaret to Anagni, Boniface's birthplace. On 7 September, with their band of some sixteen hundred men, Nogaret and Colonna surprised the little town. Boniface was taken prisoner. Sciarra wished to kill him, but Nogaret's policy was to take him to France and compel him to summon a general council. An army led by King Philip's minister Nogaret and Sciarra Colonna attacked Boniface at his Palace in Anagni next to the Cathedral. The Pope responded with a bull dated 8 September 1303, in which Philip and Nogaret were excommunicated.[ A. Tomassetti, Bullarum diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum Romanorum pontificum Tomus IV (Augustae Taurinorum 1859), pp. 170-174. The date of September 8 has caused much scholarly controversy. Chamberlain, E.R. \\"The Lord of Europe\\". The Bad Popes. Barnes and Noble. p. 120. Ian Mortimer: \\"Barriers to the Truth\\" History Today: 60:12: December 2010: 13] The French Chancellor and the Colonnas demanded the Pope's resignation; Boniface VIII responded that he would \\"sooner die\\". In response, Colonna allegedly slapped Boniface, a \\"slap\\" historically remembered as the schiaffo di Anagni (\\"Anagni slap\\"). The tide soon turned, however. On the 9th a concerted rising of the townsmen in support of Boniface put Nogaret and his allies to flight, and the pope was free. His death at Rome on 11 October saved Nogaret. The election of the timid Benedict XI was the beginning of the triumph of France that lasted through the Avignon captivity. Early in 1304 Nogaret went to Languedoc to report to Philip IV, and was rewarded by gifts of land and money. Then he was sent back with an embassy to Benedict XI to demand absolution for all concerned in the struggle with Boniface VIII. Benedict refused to meet Nogaret, excepted him from the general absolution he granted on 12 May 1304, and on 7 June issued against him and his associates at Anagni the bull Flagitiosum scelus. Nogaret replied with apologies for his conduct, and when Benedict died on 7 July 1304 Nogaret pointed to his death as a witness to the justice of his cause. French influence led to a Frenchman, Bertrand de Got (Clement V), being elected as Benedict's successor. The threat of proceedings against the memory of Boniface was renewed to force Clement to absolve Nogaret, and Clement had given way on this point when the further question of an inquiry into the condition of the Knights Templar was brought forward by Philip as a preliminary to their arrest and the seizure of their property in October 1307. Nogaret was active in getting the renegade members of the order to give evidence against their fellows, and the proceedings against them bear traces of his unscrupulous and merciless pen. Clement's weak and ineffective resistance to this still further delayed the agreement between him and Philip. Nogaret had become keeper of the seal that year in succession to Pierre de Belleperche. His talents as an advocatus diaboli were given still further employment in the trial of Guichard, bishop of Troyes, charged with various crimes, including witchcraft and unchastity. The trial, which began in 1308 and lasted till 1313, was a hint to Clement as to what might happen if the oft-repeated threat of a trial of Boniface were carried out. Absolution was obtained from Clement on 27 April 1311. Guillaume de Nogaret was to go on the next crusade and visit certain places of pilgrimage in France and Spain as a penance, but never did so. He died in 1313 with his tongue horribly thrust out, according to the chronicler Jean Desnouelles. He retained the seals till his death and was occupied with the king's affairs concerning Flanders as late as the end of March 1313. Literature Nogaret is a major character in Les Rois maudits (The Accursed Kings), a series of historical novels by Maurice Druon, which were adapted into a television miniseries in 1972 and again in 2005.

Punk Rock Songs was released by Epic without any input from the band members, as Bad Religion had already returned to Epitaph Records, and as of 2017, it has not been released in the United States. Background While the first Bad Religion compilation album All Ages contains material from their 1982 debut How Could Hell Be Any Worse? to 1992's Generator, Punk Rock Songs almost takes off from that point, including material from Stranger than Fiction (1994) up through The New America (2000). It was during this period of their career that Bad Religion had risen in popularity. Like All Ages, Punk Rock Songs contains live tracks and omits anything from Recipe for Hate, which was released between Generator and Stranger than Fiction. Although this compilation album was released after The Process of Belief, it contains no songs from that album as Bad Religion had switched record labels by that time.

In addition to being chapel-master and organist of San Petronio Basilica in Bologna, he served prominent members of the courts of Ferrara, Parma, Modena and Florence. He was a founder-member and president of the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna. Emperor Leopold I collected manuscripts of his sacred music, which reflects the Roman church cantata style of Giacomo Carissimi and looks forward to the manner of George Frideric Handel. Biography Colonna was born on 16 June 1637 in Bologna (at the time, the second largest city of the Papal States after Rome), the third of four brothers in a family of five children, son of Antonio Colonna (c. 1600‚Äì1666), a well-known organ builder, and his wife, Francesca Dinarelli. Colonna's father, nicknamed Dal Corno, was the adopted son of Stefano Colonna, a member of a large and successful family of organ-builders which had been active in central-northern Italy since the previous century. Born in Sal√≤, near Brescia around the turn of the century, Antonio may have moved with his stepfather Stefano to Bologna by 1615. Colonna received a full training both in the family profession of organ building and in musicianship. He was a pupil of Agostino Filippuzzi in Bologna, and of Antonio Maria Abbatini and Orazio Benevoli in Rome, where for a time he held the post of organist at S. Apollinare. A poem in praise of his music shows that he began to distinguish himself as a composer in 1659. In that year he was appointed organist at S. Petronio in Bologna, where on 1 November 1674 he was made chapel-master. From 1680 until 1694 he was in regular correspondence with Francesco II d'Este, Duke of Modena, for whom he wrote oratorios and helped construct organs. Other prominent patrons included the Marquis of Ferrara, Ranuccio II Farnese, Duke of Parma, and the Medici family in Florence, for whom he composed secular cantatas. In 1666 he was one of the founder-members of the Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna, of which was president from 1672 to 1691. In 1694 he traveled to Rome to try to mend bridges following a dispute regarding Arcangelo Corelli's use of parallel fifths in which he had been involved; while there, he turned down an offer from Pope Innocent XII to become chapel- master of St. Peter's Basilica, perhaps due to ill health. He died in Bologna in 1695. Colonna's pupils included the cellist-composers Giovanni Bononcini and Antonio Maria Bononcini. Music Most of Colonna's works are for the church, including settings of the psalms for three, four, five and eight voices, and various masses and motets. He also composed an opera, Amilcare. He was an important composer of oratorios, eight of which have survived, including La Profezia d'Eliseo. Emperor Leopold I received a copy of every sacred composition of Colonna, and the Austrian National Library now possesses 83 such works. His writing takes into account the resonant acoustics of S. Petronio, and many of his pieces for double choir incorporate two separate continuo parts to be played on the church's two organs. Colonna's style is for the most part dignified, with transitions in style and taste characteristic of a period when church music was in a state of transition, and was still learning to combine the gravity of the old style with the brilliance of the new. The strings in his Messe e salmi concertati op.10 have independent parts with semiquaver runs in full concerto style. Some of his motets (e.g., the solo motets, op.2, and the two- and three-part motets, op.3), are written in the lively melodic contrapuntal style of the Roman church cantatas of Giacomo Carissimi, and look forward to the chamber cantatas of Handel. In some of his late works he was able to create elaborate effects through his command of melodic line and harmony.

He was an MP from 1990 to 1996, representing the Labour Party. Early life and family Blincoe was born on 14 March 1952 in Nelson, New Zealand. His parents were Victor and May Blincoe (according to his eldest daughter). He attended Hampden Street School, Nelson College Preparatory School and Nelson College, the latter two from 1963 to 1969.Nelson College Old Boys' Register, 1856‚Äì2006, 6th edition Later, he was educated at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand where he gained two degrees: one in law and the other in political science. Prior to becoming a member of New Zealand's Parliament, he had been employed by the Wellington City Council as well as by the Accident Compensation Corporation. Blincoe currently lives in Wellington and has two children. Blincoe served as the President of NZUSA during 1976.NZUSA He rose to prominence when he became convener of the Wellington Clean Water Campaign which opposed the council on the Moa Point sewerage treatment plan. Early political career In 1983 Blincoe unsuccessfully sought the Labour Party nomination for the seat of Tasman following the retirement of Bill Rowling, but lost to Ken Shirley. Later that same year, he stood unsuccessfully for the Wellington City Council on a Labour Party ticket. In 1986 he contested the Labour nomination for Mayor of Wellington, but lost to local businessman Jim Belich. He was then elected to the City Council in the Brooklyn Ward in 1986 and then in the Southern Ward in 1989, before resigning from the Council in 1991 when he was elected to Parliament. Member of Parliament Blincoe was first elected to Parliament in the 1990 election as MP for Nelson, replacing the outgoing Philip Woollaston. He was re-elected in the 1993 election, but in the 1996 election, the seat of Nelson was expanded into rural areas formerly part of the Tasman electorate. Blincoe was defeated by the incumbent Tasman MP, Nick Smith of the National Party. =1999 election= In the 1999 election, Blincoe missed out on a seat, as a list candidate under mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation, by a narrow margin once special votes had been counted. Initially it appeared that Blincoe would have a seat in Parliament, as well as a party member directly following him on the Labour party's list. With the counting of special votes, however, the Green Party crossed the minimum 5% threshold of votes and received an electorate MP, which in turn allowed them to have seats in Parliament. In addition, Winston Peters won the constituency seat of Tauranga by a narrow margin of sixty-two votes over a National Party candidate, and this enabled his New Zealand First party to acquire extra list seats in Parliament. Once seats had been proportionally re-allocated with both the Green Party and New Zealand First in mind, fewer list seats were available for other parties, and consequently John Blincoe was not allocated a seat. Post Parliament Blincoe worked as an environmental adviser to Prime Minister Helen Clark during the 2000s and has worked on environmental matters since then. He, along with Ray Ahipene-Mercer, led the Wellington Clean Water Campaign, which successfully sought to have Wellington to treat its sewage, and stop dumping it, raw, in the sea.\\"Councillor's journey from pop to politics.\\" The Evening Post, 5 May 2000, edition 3, page 8.

Before World War II, presidents were elected by the Sejm. From 1952 to 1989‚Äîthe bulk of the Communist era‚Äîthe presidency did not exist as a separate institution, and most of its functions were fulfilled by the State Council of Poland, whose chairman was considered the equivalent of a president. The leader of the Solidarity movement, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, won the first round. However, he did not earn over 50% of the vote, which led to a runoff election. Wa≈Çƒôsa faced Polish-Canadian businessman Stanis≈Çaw Tymi≈Ñski in the second round, defeating him easily. Background Wa≈Çƒôsa was an electrician and union leader with the image of an emotional, shirtsleeves populist. The first non-communist prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, was very popular and widely considered a front-runner. He appeared as a more respectable and intellectual leader than Wa≈Çƒôsa. but also as more of a compromiser. However, in the first round, Mazowiecki finished in a distant third, with only 18.7 percent of the vote, well behind Tymi≈Ñski. The reasons for Tymi≈Ñski's unexpected success remain unclear. His vague promise to create wealth for everyone quickly, supported by his image as a patriotic Pole who had succeeded abroad, was well received at a time of radical political change and a worsening economic situation. There was increasing disappointment with the trench warfare that had broken out within the former anti-communist opposition so a mysterious, honest and patriotic stranger \\"straight out of nowhere\\" had considerable appeal. Another factor was that Tymi≈Ñski's use of political- marketing methods unknown in Poland at the time. A key element of his campaign was an omnipresent black briefcase, allegedly containing \\"secret documents\\" which would destroy his rivals' careers when the time was right. Although the elections passed without the briefcase being opened, its presence attracted constant attention. Tymi≈Ñski's adversaries adopted a similar strategy; the daily Gazeta Wyborcza (which supported Mazowiecki) reported that Tymi≈Ñski had had contact with the secret police, a story that was not withdrawn until after the elections. Despite Tymi≈Ñski's defeat, he had not only humiliated Mazowiecki (one of the best-known and most-respected figures in Polish politics), but also forced Wa≈Çƒôsa (who at that time was a national hero) into a runoff. After the election Tymi≈Ñski tried to establish a new political party, but quickly disappeared from the political scene in Poland.

In 1615, the Jesuits opened a college at Malines (Mechelen) and Berchmans was one of the first to enroll. His spiritual model was his fellow Jesuit St. Aloysius Gonzaga, and he was influenced by the example of the English Jesuit martyrs. Berchmans is the patron saint of altar servers. Early life John Berchmans was born 13 March 1599, in the city of Diest situated in what is now the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant, the son of a shoemaker. His parents were John Charles and Elizabeth Berchmans. He was the oldest of five children and at baptism was named John in honor of St. John the Baptist. He grew up in an atmosphere of political turmoil caused by a religious war between the Catholic and Protestant parts of the Low Countries. When he was age nine, his mother was stricken with a very long and a very serious illness. John would pass several hours each day by her bedside. He studied at the Gymnasium (grammar school) at Diest and worked as a servant in the household of Canon John Froymont at Malines in order to continue his studies. John also made pilgrimages to the Marian shrine of Scherpenheuvel, some 30 miles east of Brussels, but only a few miles from Diest. Call to the Society of Jesus In 1615, the Jesuits opened a college at Malines (Mechelen) and Berchmans was one of the first to enroll. Immediately upon entering, he enrolled in the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin. When Berchmans wrote his parents that he wished to join the Society of Jesus, his father hurried to Malines to dissuade him and sent him to the Franciscan convent in Malines. At the convent, a friar who was related to Berchmans also attempted to change his mind. Finally as a last resort, Berchmans's father told him that he would end all financial support if he continued with his plan. Nevertheless, on 24 September 1616, Berchmans entered the Jesuit novitiate. He was affable, kind, and endowed with an outgoing personality that endeared him to others. He requested that after ordination as a priest he could become a chaplain in the army, hoping to be martyred on the battlefield. On 24 January 1618, he made his first vows and went to Antwerp to begin studying philosophy. After only a few weeks he was sent to Rome, where he was to continue the same study. He set out on foot, with his belongings on his back, and on arrival was admitted to the Roman College to begin two years of study. He entered his third-year class in philosophy in the year 1621. His grave at the Sant'Ignazio Later, in August 1621, the prefect of studies selected Berchmans to participate in a discussion of philosophy at the Greek College, which at the time was administered by the Dominicans. Berchmans opened the discussion with great clarity and profoundness, but after returning to his own quarters, was seized with the Roman fever. His lungs became inflamed and his strength diminished rapidly. He succumbed to dysentery and fever on 13 August 1621, at the age of twenty-two years and five months. When he died, a large crowd gathered for several days to view his remains and to invoke his intercession. That same year, Phillip-Charles, Duke of Aarschot, sent a petition to Pope Gregory XV with a view to beginning the process leading to the beatification of Berchmans, whose remains were eventually buried in Sant'Ignazio Church.He also died five months after his birthday. Spirituality of St. John Berchmans St. John Berchmans took as his spiritual model his fellow Jesuit St. Aloysius Gonzaga and he was also influenced by the example of the English Jesuit martyrs. It was his realistic appreciation for the value of ordinary things, a characteristic of the Flemish mystical tradition, that constituted his holiness. He had a special devotion to God's Mother; and to him is owed the Little Rosary of the Immaculate Conception. Veneration left At the time of Berchmans's death, his heart was returned to his homeland in Belgium where it is kept in a silver reliquary on a side altar in the church at Leuven (Louvain). Berchmans was declared Blessed in 1865, and canonized in 1888. Statues frequently depict him with hands clasped, holding his crucifix, his book of rules, and his rosary. The miracle that led to his canonization occurred at the Academy of the Sacred Heart in Grand Coteau, Louisiana. In 1866, one year after the Civil War, he appeared to novice Mary Wilson. Mary's health was poor, and her parents thought that the gentler climate of south Louisiana could be a remedy. However, her health continued to decline, to the point where for about 40 days she had only been able to take liquids. \\"Being unable to speak, I said in my heart: 'Lord, Thou Who seest how I suffer, if it be for your honor and glory and the salvation of my soul, I ask through the intercession of Blessed Berchmans a little relief and health. Otherwise give me patience to the end.'\\" She went on to describe how John Berchmans then appeared to her, and she was immediately healed. When the Academy opened a boys school in 2006, the trustees named it St. John Berchmans School. It is the only shrine at the exact location of a confirmed miracle in the United States. The feast day of St. John Berchmans has never been inscribed in the General Roman Calendar, but prior to the liturgical reforms of St. John XXIII there was a Mass set for him among the section of Masses for Various Places (Missae pro aliquibus locis) of the Roman Missal which foresaw that it would be celebrated in different places on either 13 August or 26 November. The Saint is currently inscribed in the 2004 official edition of the Catholic Church's Martyrologium Romanum (p. 451) on 13 August, the date of his dies natalis (heavenly birthday). He is celebrated by the Society of Jesus on 26 Nov.. Recognition The Belgium Post Authority issued a philatelic stamp in 1965 featuring John Berchmans pictured alongside his parental home in Diest. The St. John Berchmans Sanctuary Society is an organization for altar servers that continues to have chapters at many parishes. San Antonio, Texas, became home to several Belgian farmers who arrived in the late 1800s and established truck farms on the southwest edge of the city and brought their crops to the city markets for sale. Other Belgians followed in the 1890s and also established farms in the area. The community founded a school in a one-room structure that also served as a chapel when the priest from Sacred Heart Parish visited. The chapel became known as St. John Berchmans and was the Belgian national parish until 1947, and was Flemish-speaking. The parish moved in 1948, and the former structure became home to the Belgian-American Club of Texas. In 1902, Bishop Anthony Durier requested that the Jesuits establish a second parish in Shreveport. They named the parish in honor of the saint because of the miracle experienced by Mary Wilson in nearby Grand Coteau, Louisiana. On 16 June 1986, Pope John Paul II established the Diocese of Shreveport and St. John Berchmans Church became the Cathedral.

The computing platforms included the SDS 940, XDS 940 (Tymcom-IX), XDS Sigma 7, DEC PDP-10 models KA, KI, KL and KS (Tymcom-X/XX, Tenex, August, Tops-20), Foonly, XKL Toad-1, IBM 360 & 370 (VM, MVS, GNOSIS) servers. Divisions: *INSD ‚Äî Information Services Division *STD ‚Äî Systems Technology Division *DND ‚Äî Data Networks Division In 1984 Tymshare was acquired by McDonnell Douglas, to which Tymshare had sold its hospital accounting service in 1982. Tymshare was restructured, split up and portions were resold, spun off, and merged with other companies from 1984 through 2004 when most of its legacy network was finally shut down. Islands of its network technology continued as part of EDI, into 2008. McDonnell Douglas was acquired by Boeing. Consequently, rights to use technology developed by Tymshare are currently held by Boeing, British Telecom (BT), Verizon Communications, and AT&T; Inc. due to the acquisitions and mergers from 1984 through 2005. History =Beginnings: Tymshare= Tymshare was founded in 1964https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=35877 by Thomas O‚ÄôRourke and David Schmidt, two veterans of General Electric's Computer Department. The company was entering the new market of time-sharing, which at that time was expected to grow rapidly. GE would itself soon enter this market as well, after collaborating with Dartmouth College. Tymshare initially focussed on the SDS 940 platform, initially running at University of California Berkeley. They received their own leased 940 in mid-1966, running the Berkeley Timesharing System, which had limited time-sharing capability. IBM Stretch programmer Ann Hardy rewrote the time-sharing system to service 32 simultaneous users. Tymshare grew rapidly so by 1969 it had three locations, 100 staff, and five SDS 940s. In 1968, LaRoy Tymes and Norm Hardy developed the idea of creating a network with minicomputers to communicate with the mainframes. The minicomputers‚Äîinitially an inexpensive 12-bit computer from General Automation and soon a more capable 16-bit Varian 620i‚Äîwould serve as the network's nodes, running a program called a \\"supervisor\\" which routed data, performed diagnostics, and kept network statistics; a local program at each node, dubbed a \\"leprechaun,\\" handled log-in, security, and diagnostics. The supervisor was written in assembly code by Tymes for the SDS 940, with architectural design contributions from Hardy in late 1969. The network became fully operational in 1970, and by 1972 the resulting Tymnet system connected 40 cities in the United States. Tymnet was a centralized network, unlike ARPANET; it featured centralized password storage, statistical multiplexing, flow management, and great attention to security issues. Tymshare acquired a variety of companies during its 20 years of operation. One of the first, in 1968, was Dial Data, a time-sharing service bureau in Newton, Massachusetts, that had an additional five SDS 940 computers. Additional acquisitions included United Data Centers, Alan-Babcock Computing, Bancard of Rhode Island, and TeleCheck. It soon became apparent that the SDS 940 could not keep up with the rapid growth of the network. In 1972, Joseph Rinde joined the Tymnet group and began porting the Supervisor code to the 32-bit Interdata 7/32, as the 8/32 was not yet ready. In 1973, the 8/32 became available, but the performance was disappointing and a crash-effort was made to develop a machine that could run Rinde's Supervisor. In the beginning of the 1970s Tymshare became available in Europe through CEGOS-Tymshare, a joint venture with Credit Lyonnais. It extended to Brussels in 1973. An operation in the United Kingdom started in 1974. In 1974, a second version of the Supervisor software became operational. The new Tymnet \\"Engine\\" software was used on both the Supervisor machines and on the nodes. After the migration to Interdata, they started developing Tymnet on the PDP-10. Tymshare sold a copy of the Tymnet network software to TRW, which created its own private network, TRWNET. In the 1970s, Tymshare, which had used Digital Equipment's operating system TOPS-10 for its PDP-10s, began independent work on the OS for their systems, called it TYMCOM-X, and implemented a file system that supported random access, paging with working sets, and spawnable processes. The OS work was done by a group of eleven people: Bill Weiher, Vance Socci, Allen Ginzburg, Karen Kolling, Art Atkinson, Gary Morgenthaler (founder of the company that produced INGRES), Todd Corenson, Murray Bowles, Randy Gobbel, Bill Soley, and Darren Price. Most Tymnet development was then done on TYMCOM-X.\\"TYMCOM-x\\" \\"Free Online Dictionary of Computing\\"\\"Tymshare software\\" \\"Software\\", 2 Dec 2001 Also in the 1970s, Tymshare acquired the Augmentation Research Center from SRI International. Tymes and Rinde then developed Tymnet II. Tymnet II ran in parallel with the original network, which continued to run on the Varian machines until it was phased out over a period of several years. Tymnet II's different method of constructing virtual circuits allowed for much better scalability. =Tymnet, Inc. spun off= In 1976, Tymnet Inc. was spun off from Tymshare Inc. and became a FCC \\"common carrier\\" which allowed it greater latitude as a communications service but placed its rate-setting under regulatory review. In this model, Tymnet allowed users to connect their host computers and terminals to the network, and use the computers from remote sites or sell time on their computers to other users of the network, with Tymnet charging them for the use of the network. =Tymshare sold to McDonnell Douglas= ;McDonnell Douglas Tymshare In 1984 Tymnet was bought by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation as part of the acquisition of Tymshare. The company was renamed McDonnell Douglas Tymshare, and began a major reorganization. A year later, McDonnell Douglas (MD) split Tymshare into several separate operating companies: MD Network Systems Company, MD Field Service Company, MD RCS, MD \\"xxx\\" and many more. (This is sometimes referred to the Alphabet Soup phase of the company). By then, Tymnet had outlived its parent company, Tymshare. McDonnell Douglas acquired Microdata and created McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group (MDISC), expecting to turn Microdata's desktop and server systems along with Tymshare's servers and Tymnet data network into a major player in the Information Services market. Microdata's systems were integrated into many parts of McDonnell Douglas, but Tymnet never was. MDC really did not seem to understand the telecommunications market. After five years, peace was breaking out in many places in the world and McDonnell Douglas sold off MDNSC and MDFSC at a profit for much needed cash. =MDC Network Systems Company sold to British Telecom= ;BT Tymnet, BT North America, BTNA On July 30, 1989, it was announced that British Telecom was purchasing McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company, and McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company was being spun off as a start-up called NovaDyne. McDonnell Douglas was later acquired by Boeing. British Telecom (BT) wanted to expand and the acquisition of Tymnet which was already a worldwide data network helped to achieve that goal. On November 17, 1989 MDNSC officially became BT Tymnet with its headquarters in San Jose, California. BT brought with it the idea of continuous development with teams in America, Europe, and Asia-pacific all working together on the same projects. BT renamed the Tymnet services, Global Network Services (GNS). British Telecom brought new life to the company with development of hardware and software for the Tymnet data network using contacts BT already had with telecommunication hardware vendors. There was a trial of \\"next-generation\\" nodes scattered throughout the network, called \\"TURBO engine nodes\\" based on the Motorola 68000 family. In the mid to late 1980s, serious node-code development was migrated from the PDP-10s to UNIX. Sun-3 (based on the Motorola 68000) and later Sun-4 (SPARC based) workstations and servers were purchased from Sun Microsystems, though the majority of PDP-10s were still around in the early 1990s for legacy code, as well as documentation storage. Eventually, all of the code development sources were on the Sun-4s, and the development tools (NAD, etc.) had been ported to SunOS. Another project begun a few months before the BT purchase was to migrate the Tymnet code repository from the PDP-10s to Sun systems. The new servers were dubbed the Code Generation Systems or CGS. They were initially six Sun-3/280 servers upgraded eventually to two Sun-4/690 servers for redundancy. A second pair of servers for catastrophic failover was also installed in Malvern, Pennsylvania and later moved to Norristown, Pennsylvania as part of later site consolidation efforts. After the migration, these servers managed source code and binary images for more than 6600 nodes and 38,000 customer interfaces worldwide. Tymnet was still growing, and at several times reached its peak capacity when some of its customers held network intensive events. One of these of note was a live, on- line presentation and chat on America On-Line (AOL) with pop singer Michael Jackson. Tymnet usage statistics showed AOL's call capacity was greater than its maximum volume for the duration of the event. =BTNA sold/split into MCI, Concert, and BT= MCI, NewCo, Concert In 1993 BT and MCI Communications (MCI) negotiated what they called the \\"Deal of the Century\\", where MCI would take ownership of the U.S.-based portions of Tymnet and they would create a joint venture called \\"Concert\\". (The joint venture was called \\"NewCo\\" for more than a year while they decided on a name). Concert was also aligned with another acquisition of BT, called Synchordia which was headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Tymnet was then referred to as The Packet network, the BT/MCI network and Concert Packet-switching Services (CPS). At first, MCI only wanted to use the points of presence (POPs) that Tymnet had, because there were locations in over 150 cities in the United States, giving MCI more locations from which to provide local service. As MCI cut away at Tymnet, expecting it to die, it became a cash cow that just wouldn't go away. In May 1994, there were still three DEC KL-10s under TYMCOM-X. At this time, the network had approximately 5000 nodes in 30 foreign countries. A variety of protocols can be run over a single packet-switching-network, and Tymnet's most-used protocols were X.25, asynchronous terminal and host (ATI/AHI), and SNA. BT and Concert also continued to develop the network, and after the failure of the \\"Turbo nodes\\" to take off, decided to have an outside company add Tymnet protocols to existing hardware used in their frame relay network. Telematics International developed a subset of the Tymnet protocols to run on their ACP/PCP nodes. The Telematics nodes were connected in a mesh network (every node logically connected to every other node) via frame-relay and appeared to Tymnet as super-nodes that were directly connected to as many as 44 other super-nodes interconnecting most of Europe, Asia and the Americas as a high speed data network. MCI took a different direction and sought to migrate the network protocols to run over TCP/IP and use SPARC technology. The supervisor technology was rewritten in C to run as standard UNIX applications under Solaris. Funding for this project was at a minimum but the Tymnet engineers believed it was a superior method and proceeded anyway. Times were changing and the Internet and World Wide Web were becoming a practical and even important part of corporate and personal life. Tymnet technology needed improvements to keep pace with TCP/IP and other Internet protocols. Both BT and MCI decided not to compete with the Internet, but to convert their customer base to IP-based networks and technologies. However, the Tymnet network was still bringing in considerable cash ‚Äî in some cases more than current IP based services ‚Äî so both BT and MCI needed to keep their customers happy. MCI, MCI WorldCom, WorldCom vs. BT, Concert In 1997 talks were underway for BT to acquire MCI. The deal fell through, and in September, 1998 MCI was acquired by WorldCom after they made a better offer for the company. Actually, the WorldCom offer was nearly identical to the BT offer, but where BT planned to buy out MCI shares of stock, WorldCom offered a stock-swap, which was more attractive to the stockholders. WorldCom took control in September 1998 and dissolved the BT/MCI alliance as of October 15, 1998. Concert's headquarters in Reston, Virginia With the alliance gone, BT and MCI WorldCom began the process of unraveling and separating their extensive voice and data communications systems. Concert created Project Leonardo to separate the BT and MCI WorldCom voice and data networks. At times over the next five years, advancements were made or stalled due to BT and MCI management negotiating and renegotiating the terms of their contractual obligations to each other made during the alliance. At times, things came to a standstill, or decisions made were reversed, and some reversed again at a later time. Parts of the project were to migrate customers from X.25 to IP based networks, while others created a duplicate set of services so that both Concert and MCI could separately continue to run and manage their own portions of the network. Accounting data for network usage was also shared by the two companies and had to be separated before clients could be billed properly.  Concert and BT+AT&T;'s headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia  In 2000 BT then went searching for another alliance, and created a new Concert alliance between BT and AT&T;, moving the headquarters to Atlanta, Georgia. This alliance did not help the negotiations between BT and MCI WorldCom as their partners from MCI and AT&T; were corporate enemies. For Tymnet, the data network portion of the split, and the \\"CPS Leonardo\\" project, the split was never fully realized. Instead, MCI WorldCom completed their migration of services from Tymnet to IP based services in March 2003 and disconnected their supervisor nodes and their portion of the network on March 31, 2003. BT continued to run the network using their own supervisor and other utility nodes until February 2004 when their last customer was able to move all of its customers to other access services. BT and AT&T; dissolved their Concert alliance on September 30, 2003 and the remaining BT assets were combined with BTNA assets into BT Americas, Inc. Sometime in early March 2004, without ceremony, BT Americas disconnected the last two remaining Tymnet supervisors from the network, effectively shutting it down. MCI WorldCom still had a profitable segment of its business based on EDI technology. This technology used Tymnet to interface between Tandem computers using a non-standard x.25 interface and a high speed bi-synch modem used by the EDI customers. Prior to shutting down the MCI/WorldCom portion of Tymnet, they adapted the Tymnet Engine node code to permit internal connections between the x.25 interface and the high-speed modem interface without the aid of the Tymnet Supervisor. Once this was tested and deployed, they were able to shut down the rest of the MCI/WorldCom portion of Tymnet and continue to support their EDI customers. These \\"islands\\" of Tymnet were still running 5 years later in 2008. WorldCom bankruptcy WorldCom executives were involved in a financial scandal resulting in the CEO, Bernie Ebbers, to be ousted and later charged with violations of federal statutes. This scandal sent the stock price down to 10 cents per share, and WorldCom filed for bankruptcy. It emerged from bankruptcy renamed as MCI several months later. AT&T; sold to SBC On January 31, 2005, SBC Communications (SBC) announced that it would purchase AT&T; Corp. for more than $16 billion. Shortly thereafter, the SBC name was changed to AT&T; Inc. to distinguish itself from the original AT&T; Corp. MCI sold to Verizon On February 14, 2005, Verizon agreed to acquire MCI, formerly WorldCom, after SBC agreed to acquire AT&T; Corp. just a few weeks earlier. Verizon was formed in 2000 when Bell Atlantic, one of the Regional Bell Operating Companies, merged with GTE. Prior to its transformation into Verizon, Bell Atlantic had merged with another Regional Bell Operating Company, NYNEX, in 1997  Tymshare SUPER BASIC  SUPER BASIC was a compile and go implementation of a variant of the BASIC programming language for the Scientific Data Systems SDS 940 time-sharing computer system, commercialized by Tymshare around 1968.

BAP operates on a not-for-profit basis, funded through its membership and support from corporate partners. It was originally named the British-American Project for the Successor Generation. The Project meets annually for a four-day conference on a topic of current concern to both countries. Each year, roughly 24 new participants are selected from either side of the Atlantic, on the basis of service to their communities and professional achievement, and sponsored to attend the conference as Delegates. At the end of each conference, Delegates are elected Fellows of the Project. Fellows from past years attend the annual conferences at their own expense, with many returning in successive years. Goals Established in 1985 BAP was created to help maintain and enrich the long-standing relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States. The Project was the brainchild of Nick Butler, an economist at BP who at that time was also a prospective Labour Party parliamentary candidate and a research fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House). Along with many others in both countries who viewed the special relationship favorably, he had become concerned about a growing tide of anti-American sentiment among his generation in the UK. Butler's response was to propose a series of conferences, similar in format to the annual get-together of Anglo-German leaders at Konigswinter, developing relationships between the participants and broadening understanding. This rapidly gained backing from Chatham House and the US Embassy in London. It was Sir Charles Villiers, the former chairman of British Steel, who secured funding by inviting in two American anglophile friends, Lew van Dusen and Isadore Scott, who were able to secure funding and fulfill the dream of creating, in a younger generation, a multiplicity of transatlantic friendships like their own. A US BAP organiser describes the BAP network as committed to \\"grooming leaders\\" while promoting \\"the leading global role that [the US and Britain] continue to play\\".  The Fellowship  BAP strives to draw its membership from as wide a selection of backgrounds and fields as possible. Fellows have included senior members in nearly every executive administration in the US and the UK over the past thirty years, the leader of the British Labour Party, heads of national security, a former chief of the British armed forces, US Mayors, Members of Congress and US Senators, award- winning comedians, high-profile journalists, distinguished academics and filmmakers, CEOs of major corporations, faith leaders and successful entrepreneurs. The competition for places is generally fierce. Each year BAP organizes a rigorous selection process to identify approximately 20 individuals from the US and 20 from the UK who will join the Fellowship from all walks of life, including business, media, law, government, the military, sports, the public sector, NGOs, music, visual and creative industries. BAP receives over 200 nominations annually from existing Fellows, Advisory Board members, donors and outside organizations. Annual event The annual conference is the key event in the calendar, bringing together 150-200 Fellows and newly chosen nominees (known as Delegates) from both sides of the Atlantic. Delegates are invited to attend the conference with all associated costs paid for by BAP. BAP's 2018 Conference will be held in Seattle, Washington. Each year, roughly 40 new participants are selected from a variety of backgrounds among the intellectual and influential society on both sides of the Atlantic. At the start of each year, each existing member can nominate people in the general age range of 28 to 40. The nomination processes are different in the U.S. and UK. The UK nominees are interviewed and tested: there are competitive debates, management games and personal presentations; U.S. nominees must submit letters of recommendation and have a separate process of selection. Once selected, the Delegates attend the centerpiece of the British-American Project, its annual conference, held in November each year and alternating between the U.S. and the UK. = Previous Conferences = The overarching goal of the yearly conference is to provide a wide range of issues (with a variety of presentation styles) to provoke thought and debate, to inform and challenge, and to foster greater understanding among participants about competing views on a topic. Discussions often grapple with the similarities and differences between the attitudes of representatives of the two countries to the issues addressed during the conference. Organisation The British-American Project is now affiliated with the Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). BAP is a non-profit, funded by its members and donations from corporate partners.Nick Cohen - Without Prejudice: \\"Cry freedom... and order a Big Mac - BAP conference\\", The Observer, 31 October 1999, hosted at Bilderberg website, accessed 17 June 2013 While acknowledging the connections made among journalists and the political class in the two countries, a 1999 article in The Observer noted critics saying it was another example of too much US influence in Britain. Participants have been highly favorable about the project. Criticism During the administration of President Bill Clinton in the US, the Australian journalist John Pilger attacked the BAP as an example of \\"Atlanticist freemasonry.\\" He asserted in November 1998 that \\"many members are journalists, the essential foot soldiers in any network devoted to power and propaganda.\\"John Pilger \\"Having a fun time in New Orleans: the latest recruits (sorry, \\"alumni\\") of latter-day Reaganism\\", New Statesman, 13 November 1998 Notable members =Alumni= Politicians * Stephen Dorrell * Alan Sked, founder of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) * David Miliband * The Baron Mandelson * The Baron Robertson of Port Ellen * The Baroness Symons * Jonathan Powell (Tony Blair's chief of staff) * The Baroness Scotland * Douglas Alexander * Geoff Mulgan * Sadiq Khan * Matthew Taylor * David Willetts * Rushanara Ali (2004) * Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana * Diana Negroponte, the wife of John Negroponte * Rafael Anchia, Texas House of Representatives * Dan Branch, Texas House of Representatives * Lolita Jackson, Manhattan Director, Community Affairs, NYC Mayor's Office Journalists * Jeremy Paxman, BBC * Evan Davis, BBC * James Naughtie, BBC * William Crawley, BBC * Jane Hill, BBC * Ben Hammersley, Wired UK, BBC * Trevor Phillips, BBC * Isabel Hilton, The Independent, The Guardian, BBC * Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, The Independent, The London Evening Standard * Charles Moore, The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Telegraph, The Spectator * Rowan Pelling, The Daily Telegraph * Hugh Raven, The Sunday Telegraph * Christopher Cragg, The Financial Times * Caroline St John-Brooks, The Times Educational Supplement, The Sunday Times * George Brock, The Times * Michael Elliott, The Economist * Daniel Franklin, The Economist * Diane Coyle, The Independent * Mo Rocca, CBS * Tad Friend, The New Yorker * Frederick Kempe, The Wall Street Journal * Daniel Drezner, The Wall Street Journal, The New Republic, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, The New York Times, Slate, Tech Central Station, among others * Joel Stein, LA Times Arts and media * Margaret Hill, BBC current affairs producer * Chris DeRose (Author), New York Times bestselling author * Andrea Wong, CEO Lifetime Television * Lawrence Kasdan, Motion Picture Director * Lauren Greenfield, Photographer * Ellen V.

It is approximately long, and the mean flow at Frenchay is . The name Frome is shared with several other rivers in South West England and means 'fair, fine, brisk‚Äô. The river is known locally in east Bristol as the Danny. The Frome originally joined the Avon downstream of Bristol Bridge, and formed part of the city defences, but in the thirteenth century it was diverted through marshland belonging to St Augustine's Abbey (now Bristol Cathedral), as part of major port improvement works. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the lower reaches of the river were culverted and the river now flows under The Centre into St Augustine's Reach. As with many urban rivers, the Frome has suffered from pollution, but several stretches run through parks and reserves that sustain a range of wildlife. The river's power was harnessed by many watermills, and the river mouth area was developed as shipyards by the eighteenth century. As the city of Bristol developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, flooding became a major problem, remedied by the construction of storm drains and diversions. Course long, the River Frome rises in the grounds of Dodington Park in the Cotswolds of South Gloucestershire, flows through Chipping Sodbury in a north westerly direction through Yate, and is then joined by the Nibley brook at Nibley and the Mayshill brook at Algars Manor near Iron Acton, both on the left. The river turns south towards the next settlement of Frampton Cotterell, where it is met by the Ladden brook on the right bank. Continuing southwards between Yate and Winterbourne, the Frome crosses Winterbourne Down, to Damsons Bridge where the Folly brook tributary merges on the left bank. The Bradley brook joins on the right bank at Hambrook just before the river passes underneath the M4 motorway and, also on the right, the Stoke brook (or Hambrook) joins at Bromley Heath. After passing under the A4174 the Frome enters a more urban environment passing between Frenchay on the right and Bromley Heath and Downend on the left. Turning in a more south westerly direction the river enters Oldbury Court estate, a city park also known as Vassal's, where it is joined by the first of two Fishponds brooks both on the left. The river then passes Snuff Mills, entering a steep valley at Stapleton, where the second Fishponds brook joins, then passing Eastville park, where it feeds the former boating lake. The river then flows under the M32 motorway and parallels its course for a while before disappearing into an underground culvert at Eastville Sluices, upstream of Baptist Mills. It is joined underground by Coombe brook on the left and Horfield brook on the right. A brief stretch in St Jude's is uncovered and then the river runs underneath Broad Weir, Fairfax Street and Rupert Street. At the site of the former Stone Bridge, near the junction of Rupert Street and Christmas Street, the main flow is channelled through Mylnes Culvert. This follows the course of Marsh Street, Prince Street and Wapping Road, and joins the New Cut close to Gaol Ferry Bridge. The culverted section between Stone Bridge and St Augustine's Reach is now a flood relief channel. =Navigation= From Damsons Bridge (Grid Reference ) to Snuff Mills () the river is navigable, but only by canoe (kayak) though some portaging may be required. It's also possible to start at Moorend Bridge () or Frenchay Bridge (). Some of the Bradley brook has also been kayaked. History Map of Bristol Castle in the middle ages showing the original path of the Frome. Samuel Seyer believed it flowed farther south (the white dashed line) Between Frenchay and Stapleton the river drops nearly , and as a result there a number of corn and other mills were established to harness the water power. They were undershot mills with no mill ponds. Today a wheel at Snuff Mills is preserved and the mill buildings of Cleeve Mill survive as a private residence. The Frome originally flowed east of its present-day course from Stone Bridge (now underground by St John's Gate) along the line of St Stephen's Street and Baldwin Street, joining the Avon near Bristol Bridge. The narrow strip of high land between the two rivers was a naturally strategic place for the Saxon town of Brigstow, later the walled centre of the city, to develop. When Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester, rebuilt Bristol Castle, the Frome was diverted (at present-day Broad Weir) to form the castle moat, so that the city was entirely surrounded by water.Watson, 93‚Äì96. In the mid-thirteenth century the harbour had become so busy that it was decided to divert the Frome into a new course through a marsh belonging to St Augustine's Abbey into a \\"Deep Ditch\\" that was dug from Stone Bridge to join the Avon at the present site of Prince Street bridge. This has been the line of the river ever since, known as St Augustine's Reach.Watson, 97‚Äì98. The Floating Harbour was constructed in 1809, isolating the Avon and Frome from tides between Cumberland Basin and Totterdown Lock. The increasing use of the Frome as an open sewer combined with the loss of the scouring action of the tides meant that it was now becoming a health hazard and in 1825 it was again diverted, with locks at Stone House, channelling the main flow through Mylne's Culvert to the tidal Avon at New Cut, to the east of what is now Gaol Ferry Bridge. Up to 1858 the Frome was open along its whole length, and crossed by some 13 bridges. During the latter half of the nineteenth century, a culvert was built from Wade Street in St Judes to Stone Bridge, covering this stretch completely: Rupert Street, Fairfax Street and Broad Weir run over this culverted section. St Augustine's Trench from Stone Bridge to Draw Bridge (near the northern end of Baldwin Street) was covered over in 1893 and the section between that point and the bottom of Park Street was covered over in 1938.Watson, 99‚Äì102. =Shipbuilding= Shipbuilding on the River Frome may have been carried out for centuries, with docks on the northern part of Narrow Quay (St Clements Dock and Aldworth's Dock) being archaeologically excavated. By the seventeenth century, Francis Baylie built warships on the east bank at Narrow Quay. Tombs' Dock was built opposite at Dean's Marsh in 1760, on the west bank of the Frome and was later lengthened to 435 feet, the builders including FW Green, and two additional docks were built by at Teast's Docks in 1790; a drydock later known as Albert Dock and a mud dock at Mansfield's point. The last shipbuilder closed in 1883.Farr, Graeme (1971). Bristol Shipbuilding in the 19th Century Bristol Branch of the Historical Association. =Etymology= The name derives from the British Celtic, meaning 'fair, fine, brisk‚Äô. It is not to be confused with other rivers in the south west of England with the same name. The historic spelling, Froom, is still sometimes used and this is how the name of the river is pronounced (as in broom). In the nineteenth and twentieth century the River Frome became known in East Bristol as the Danny. The derivation of this name is uncertain, some suggest a nickname, taken from the Blue Danube Waltz, others that it was derived from the Australian slang word dunny. Hydrology and flooding The mean flow as measured at Frampton Cottrell is , with a peak on 30 October 2000 of and a minimum on 10 August 1990 of . The mean flow as measured at Frenchay is , with a peak on 10 July 1968 of and a minimum on 9 August 1976 of . The Environment Agency in 2008 classified the river as Grade A (highest grade) for chemical content, but the biology was assessed at C grade (mid). Measurements were taken over a stretch of river between Bradley brook and Broomhill. Part of the Frome Valley Walkway: a alt= a river flowing over a weir, trees surrounding on a sunny day, blue sky, dark pool in foreground Where it passes through Bristol the river was prone to flooding, but the Northern Stormwater Interceptor, running from Eastville Sluices to the River Avon downstream of Clifton Suspension Bridge, has since been constructed to control this. At Wade Street, St Judes, the river enters an underground culvert, emerging at what Bristolians call The Centre (formerly the 'Tramways Centre'), but only when there is a risk of flooding. The river is otherwise channelled through Mylne's Culvert into the River Avon at a point between Bathurst Basin and Gaol Ferry Bridge. Three further flood relief tunnels- Castle Ditch, Fosseway and Castle Green Tunnel - run under Castle Park in central Bristol to carry excess flows into the Floating Harbour. Major floods have included Mina Road, St Werburghs and Wellington Road in October 1882; Eastville, St Werburghs and Broadmead in 1936 and 1937; Eastville Park and nearby due to melting snow in 1947; 1968 Bristol Rovers F.C. old ground at Eastville. The Broadmead area still remains at risk of flooding in severe weather conditions. In December 2011, a kayaker was killed after capsizing in the flooded river at Snuff Mills weir in Frenchay during a night-time paddle. Frome Valley Walkway The Frome Valley Walkway is a public footpath, long, that runs almost the entire length of the river from Old Sodbury to Bristol. A guide pamphlet has been published. The walkway was created by a partnership between local authorities, the Environment Agency, wildlife organisations and location action groups, including Avon Biodiversity Partnership, Avon Invasive Weeds Forum, Avon Wildlife Trust, Bristol City Council, Bristol Naturalists' Society and South Gloucestershire Council. Regular events include clearing of invasive species and guided walks. Natural history The Frome valley supports a range of wildlife and plants, passing through or near to a number of nature reserves and parks, including Goose Green fields, Chill Wood, Cleeve Valley, Oldbury Court park and Eastville Park. Notable species include grey wagtails, wild service trees, dippers and several species of bats. One of the last British populations of the endangered native white-clawed crayfish in the Bristol area was found in the river, but became extinct in 2008.

Plot summary Jack Breslin (Joseph Cortese) is a police officer investigating brutal murders in which organs have been removed from the victims. He learns that the crimes are being committed by a monstrous alien insectoid prisoner known as a xenomorph, possessing shape-shifting and physical possession abilities, who has escaped from an alien prison starship passing by the solar system, and he teams up with a beautiful medical officer from that ship, Ta'Ra (Maryam d'Abo), to track down the villain. Ta'Ra has assorted superhuman abilities, including telepathy and superhuman agility, which come in handy during the mission. Cast * Joe Cortese as Jack Breslin * Maryam d'Abo as Ta'Ra * George Dzundza as Frank Dileo * Gregory Sierra as Victor Maldonado * Kim Delaney as Mandy Estabrook * John Putch as Wendle * Robert Webber as Commissioner Estabrook * Earl Billings as Coroner Notes The miniseries drew high ratings for NBC and critics noted the chemistry between Jack and Ta'Ra as one of its high points. One week after its ratings success, Brandon Tartikoff announced it would become a weekly series. 13 episodes were ordered. Something Is Out There fared poorly opposite the very successful Dallas and the show was later moved to compete with Beauty and the Beast where ratings only worsened.Starlog, Issue #140, interview with Marc Shapiro The series was canceled after only six one-hour episodes were broadcast, with two additional episodes produced but not broadcast at the time except in isolated cases in the US. Due to its short run, the series is not often found in syndication, but the Sci-Fi Channel did include it as part of a rotation of short-lived series, including broadcasting the previously unaired episodes. An edited down version of the miniseries has aired as a syndicated television movie. Development Originally conceived by Frank Lupo in 1987 with the title Invader, NBC ordered a four-hour mini-series for broadcast on May 8, 1988 with a budget of $7.5 million. Shooting took 41 days on locations in Los Angeles and Australia. Producers John Ashley and Frank Lupo decided to alter the program's concept to cope with the comparatively smaller budget of the weekly series. \\"Things definitely change fast when a mini-series or movie becomes a weekly series,\\" said Ashley. \\"It's great when you've got four hours, $7.5 million and the talents of Rick Baker and John Dykstra to play around with. But what happens when you're suddenly cut to a million per episode budget, don't have the talents of Baker or Dykstra and have to take the mini-series concept to the next level while turning out an hour a week? What happens is that you make changes.\\" It was decided to focus the show on the relationship between Jack and Ta'Ra, on Ta'Ra's special abilities and to reject a \\"monster of the week\\" approach. Ta'Ra, who was later revealed to be from a distant planet called Zeton, chooses to stay on Earth posing as Jack's cousin. The show strayed from its science-fiction origins with supernatural stories featuring telekinesis and telepathy. \\"In the early episodes, we felt we had pulled our reins in too far. We discovered that many people were expecting an alien every week, because of the mini-series, and were being disappointed,\\" said Ashley in an interview with Starlog during filming of the eighth episode. \\"What we were giving them just wasn't working. So, we took a step back and looked at what elements made the mini-series work and made the later episodes along the lines of where the show should have gone. We went back to basics. We brought the creature from the mini-series back for a two-part episode, gave Ta'Ra some additional powers and made the show more science fictional in nature.\\" The changes were not enough to draw audience members back, and Something Is Out There was finally cancelled.

He was known as the Father of the South Yorkshire Iron Trade. Background He was born at Sheffield in Flavell's Yard, Fargate, on 6 December 1816. He was the second son of Samuel Brown, a slater of that town. He was educated at a local school held in a garret, and was apprenticed at the age of fourteen to Earl, Horton, & Co., factors, of Orchard Place, In 1831, his employers engaged in the manufacture of files and table cutlery, taking an establishment in Rockingham Street, which they styled the Hallamshire Works. Nonetheless he did take over the company's factoring business with the help of a loan for ¬£500 thanks to the backing of his father and uncle and for several years travelled the country selling goods.\\"Aspects of Sheffield 1\\", Melvyn Jones (Editor), , Chapter \\"Endcliffe Hall: A Gentleman Industrialist Residence‚Äù by Julie Goddard Gives biography of Brown. In 1839, he married Mary (b. 1813 ‚Äì died 28 November 1881), eldest daughter of Benjamin Scholefield of Sheffield. Brown lived with his wife throughout much of his working career at Shirle Hill in Sheffield. He died without issue at Shortlands, the house of Mr. Barron, Bromley in Kent, on 27 December 1896, and was buried at Ecclesall on 31 December. Career He started his own company John Brown & Company in 1844 manufacturing steel at a small foundry on a site at what is the now Orchard Square Shopping centre. The business prospered so well that he sold his factoring firm and moved to larger premises on Furnival Street. =Invention of volute spring buffer= In 1848 Brown invented the conical steel spring buffer for railway carriages which he sold to the London and North Western Railway as well as other railways throughout the UK.

By 1859 Brown was producing rails for the quickly expanding railway industry using the Bessemer process. \\"The Making of Modern Yorkshire\\", J.S. Fletcher (Google Books) Gives biographical details. Atlas Steel and Ironworks Brown's great achievement was the development of armour plating for war vessels. In 1860, he saw at Toulon the French ship La Gloire. She was a timber-built 90-gun three-decker, cut down and coated with hammered plate armour, four and a half inches thick. This contrivance occasioned the British government so much uneasiness that they ordered ten 90- and 100-gun vessels to be similarly adapted. Brown, from a distant inspection of La Gloire, came to the conclusion that the armoured plates used in protecting her might have been rolled instead of hammered. He was at that time mayor of Sheffield, and he invited the premier, Lord Palmerston, to inspect the process. Palmerston's visit was followed in April 1863 by one from the lords of the admiralty, who saw a plate rolled to twelve inches thick and fifteen to twenty feet long. The latter visit was the subject of an article in Punch (18 April 1863). The admiralty were convinced of the merits of Brown's methods, and the royal commission on armour plates ordered from his works nearly all the plates they required. In a few years, he had sheathed fully three-fourths of the British navy. In 1856, he concentrated in Savile Street, Sheffield, the different manufactures in which he had been engaged in various parts of the town. His establishment, styled the Atlas Works, covered nearly thirty acres, and increased until it gave employment to over four thousand artisans. He undertook the manufacture of armour plates, ordnance forgings, railway bars, steel springs, buffers, tires, and axles, supplied Sheffield with iron for steel-making purposes, and was the first successfully to develop the Bessemer process, and to introduce into Sheffield the manufacture of steel rails. He received frequent applications from foreign governments for armour plates, but invariably declined such contracts unless the consent of the home government was obtained. During the civil war in America he refused large orders from the northern states. =Retirement= All Saints, Brightside, Sheffield Endcliffe Hall in 1865 In 1864, his business was converted into a limited liability company, and he retired to Endfield Hall, Ranmoor, near Sheffield.

It has about 23,000 inhabitants. It lies in the historical region of Upper Silesia, at the confluence of the rivers Opava and Opavice, near the Polish border. History The area has been inhabited almost without interruption since the stone age. Its history stretches back to the 13th century when Krnov acquired town rights. The town was first mentioned in 1240 and served as the capital of an independent duchy from 1377 to 1523. From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. According to the Austrian census of 1910, the town had 16,681 inhabitants, 15,647 of whom had permanent residence there. The census had asked people for their native language; 15,390 (98.4%) were German- speaking and 247 (1.5%) were Czech-speaking. Jews were not allowed to declare Yiddish, thus most of them declared German as their native language. The most populous religious groups were Roman Catholics with 15,290 (91.7%), followed by Protestants with 885 (5.3%) and the Jews with 459 (2.8%).Ludwig Patryn (ed): Die Ergebnisse der Volksz√§hlung vom 31.

On the left, the nylon vest. On the right, the several layers of ballistic nylon that provide the actual protection A flak jacket or flak vest is a form of body armour. A flak jacket is designed to provide protection from case fragments (\\"frag\\") from high explosive weaponry, such as anti-aircraft artillery (\\"flak\\" is a German contraction for , \\"aircraft-defense gun\\"), grenades, some pellets used in shotguns and anti-personnel mines, and other lower-velocity projectiles. It is not designed to protect against bullets fired from small arms such as rifles or handguns. However, certain flak jackets are able to sustain certain gunshots, depending on the armor, the projectile, the angle at which the shot was fired (an oblique angle for example), and the range from which the shot was fired. The term \\"flak jacket\\" is often colloquially applied to newer body armor featuring protection against small arms projectiles, but the original usage predated the existence of functional bulletproof vests and the two are not interchangeable in performance.  History  Anecdotes describing garments designed to protect the wearer from penetrating weapons can be found far back into recorded history. Two types of protective garment from the American Civil War in the 1860s had a basic design similar to the flak jacket or ballistic armor of modern times in that solid plates were used as the main ballistic protection. The \\"Soldiers' Bullet Proof Vest\\" was manufactured by the G. & D. Cook & Company of New Haven, Connecticut. It consisted of two pieces of steel inserted into the pockets of a regular black military vest. Versions for infantry weighed 3 ¬Ω pounds while a version for cavalry and artillery weighed 7 pounds. They sold for $5‚Äì7. A more medieval-looking type of armor was made by the Atwater Armor Company, also of New Haven. It consisted of four large plates of steel held on the body by broad metal hooks over the shoulders and a belt around the waist. The Atwater vest was heavier than the Cook models and cost about twice as much. During World War I, a number of British and American officers recognized that many casualties could be avoided if effective armor were available. Isolated efforts at developing armor were made, and soldiers could make individual purchases or efforts, but there was no armor issued to the troops. As it is today, issues of weight, cost, availability of materials and/or environmental stability complicated the issue of developing armor that would also be effective. For example, soft armor made of silk was tried on a small scale based on Japanese designs, but this material did not last well under harsh environmental conditions. The first usage of the term \\"flak jacket\\" refers to the armour originally developed by the Wilkinson Sword company during World War II to help protect Royal Air Force (RAF) aircrew from the flying debris and shell fragments thrown by German anti-aircraft guns' high-explosive shells (flak itself is an abbreviation for the German word \\"Fliegerabwehrkanone\\" (aircraft-defense gun)). The idea for the flak jacket came from Col. Malcolm C. Grow, Surgeon of the US Eighth Air Force in Britain. He thought that many wounds he was treating could have been prevented by some kind of light armor. In 1943 he was awarded the Legion of Merit for developing the flak vest. Unfortunately, flak jackets proved to be too bulky for wear within the confines of the RAF's standard bomber aircraft, the Avro Lancaster. The Royal Air Force subsequently offered the jackets to the United States Army Air Forces, which adopted them as a Defense Standard. The UK subsequently supplied the USAAF with 9,600 flak jackets under reverse lend-lease. During World War II, flak jackets and steel helmets were worn by US Navy personnel on aircraft carriers during battle, since the ships and especially their flight decks offered little protection for their crew. The jackets were supposed to protect against shell fragments and heat.  Ballistic protection  Col. Grow‚Äôs request to the Wilkinson Sword company was to develop a vest that could stop a .45 caliber round fired at close range. Although flak jackets offered some basic protection against small caliber bullets and shell fragments (which was valued by their users), ultimately they proved to be less effective than hoped. Flak jackets are now generally considered to be inferior to ballistic vests. It was claimed that the M-1951 flak jacket could stop a 90 grain 7.62√ó25mm Tokarev pistol round at the muzzle of the gun. However, even the Vietnam era revised flak jacket was not really designed to stop an AK-47 round (7.62√ó39mm) fired at close range. Nevertheless, it did a good job of stopping shell blasts, rocket fragments, and slow speed bullets fired at a moderate range. It was not until 1970 that the U.S. National Institute of Justice, which now publishes test and performance standards for body armor, began a deliberate program to develop body armor for law enforcement personnel that would be effective against specific threats that were common causes of officer injury and death. At the time that included .38 Special and .22 Long Rifle bullets, in particular, and also bullets from 9mm, .45, and .32 caliber firearms.  Materials  The first flak jackets consisted of manganese steel plates sewn into a waistcoat made of ballistic nylon (a material engineered by the DuPont company); therefore, flak jackets functioned as an evolved form of plate armour or brigandine. The first flak jacket weighed 22 pounds. During the Korean and Vietnam wars, the flak jacket was changed and the manganese steel plates were replaced by other materials. The U.S. Army's vests (Body Armor, Fragmentation Protective, Vest M69) weighed under eight pounds and were made of several layers of ballistic nylon. The vests used by the U.S. Marines (Vest, Armored M-1955) weighed more than ten pounds and were a combination of ballistic nylon layers and fiberglass plates known as Doron. Doron was made of fiberglass fibers placed in an ethyl cellulose resin under high pressure. It was named after then-Colonel Georges F. Doriot, then director of the Military Planning Division, Office of the Quartermaster General. The generation of armor developed in the 1970s through the National Institute of Justice incorporated layers of soft armor in the form of DuPont‚Äôs Kevlar fabric, which has since become synonymous with ballistic protection and a general term used for several similar (aramid-based) materials.

The park was purchased in 1926 by the Corporation of Bristol as \\"a pleasure walk for citizens of Bristol\\" and restored in the 1980s by the Fishponds Local History Society. The park's name originates from one of the millers. His nickname was 'Snuffy Jack' because his smock was always covered in snuff. The park includes an old quarry and a stone mill. The old mill within the park was used for cutting and crushing stone from the many quarries along the Frome Valley during the late 19th century. It contains a waterwheel, egg-ended boiler in its setting and the remains of a vertical steam engine. Despite the name, tobacco snuff was never ground in this mill.

The lineage of ownership was to continue in a relatively direct path from the Lestonnacs, though through the female side, with proprietors' names such as d'Aul√®de, Fumel, d'Hargicourt, including an alliance of marriage with the Pontac family of Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion in 1654, which became crucial to the inclusion of Ch√¢teau Margaux among the four first growths. By the beginning of the 18th century, the estate comprised with a third devoted to viticulture, which is nearly identical to the modern layout. As with many of M√©doc's ch√¢teaux, the early 18th century saw the wine develop from a pale watery drink that faded within only a few years, to the dark, complex liquid that has been stored in cellars ever since, and a transformation was largely due to an estate manager named Berlon, who revolutionised techniques of wine-making by introducing novel ideas such as banning harvesting in the early morning to avoid dew-covered grapes and subsequently dilution, and acknowledged the importance of soil quality in the various terroir found on the estate. In 1771, wine from the estate became the first claret to be sold at Christie's, and upon visiting Bordeaux in 1787, Thomas Jefferson made note of Ch√¢teau Margaux as one of the \\"four vineyards of first quality\\". Following the French Revolution, the owner Elie du Barry was executed by guillotine and the estate expropriated, eventually becoming the property of the citizen Miqueau who neglected its care and maintenance. Briefly rescued by Laure de Fumel, she was soon forced to sell, and in 1802 the estate was purchased by the Marquis de la Colonilla, Bertrand Douat for 654,000 francs. The estate's old ch√¢teau was torn down and completely rebuilt when Douat commissioned one of Bordeaux' foremost architects, , to create the buildings in the First Empire style, the mansion for the Marquis to move into by 1812. Large portions of shares in the estate were bought by the Bordeaux wine merchant Fernand Ginestet (then owner of the adjacent Ch√¢teau Lascombes) in 1925, and the family share was gradually increased to allow his son Pierre Ginestet to take complete ownership in 1949. In 1965, Pierre Ginestet controversially declared a new estate policy that the vintage year would only be affixed to great vintages, while selling the wine of lesser years as non-vintage wine, like the customary practice of Champagne. A bottle of Ch√¢teau Margaux 1994 = Modern history = Bottle label of Ch√¢teau Margaux 1960 Following the Bordeaux economic crisis of 1973, the Ginestet family were forced to sell Ch√¢teau Margaux. An attempt by National Distillers & Chemical Corporation to acquire Ch√¢teau Margaux was vetoed by the French government on grounds that the estate was a national treasure. (This has since been reported as a Coca-Cola Company effort prevented by French President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing.Thornhill, John, Financial Times (January 28, 2005) US investors rail against return of French 'protectionism' ) A successful acquisition took place in 1976 by French grocery and finance group F√©lix Potin, headed by Greek Andr√© Mentzelopoulos for a sum near 72 million francs, or $16 million. Mentzelopoulos transformed the vineyard through restoring the neglected vineyard, chais, and mansion and the consultancy of oenologist √âmile Peynaud. By the time of Mentzelopoulos' death in 1980, Ch√¢teau Margaux was considered substantially restored to its former reputation, with the 1978 and 1979 vintages declared \\"exceptional\\". At the beginning of the 1990s, an exchange of shares was negotiated with the Agnelli family but the management remained in the hands of Mentzelopoulos' daughter Corinne Mentzelopoulos. In 2003, Corinne Mentzelopoulos bought back the majority stake and became the sole shareholder of Ch√¢teau Margaux. A bottle of Ch√¢teau Margaux 1787 holds the record as the most expensive bottle of wine ever broken, insured at $225,000. Margaux Hemingway received her given name from this wine.

He starred in both theatre and film productions, mainly before World War II. He and Kazimierz Krukowski performed as the duo Lopek and Florek in kleynkunst productions at Qui Pro Quo and other noted Warsaw cabarets. Another pseudonym was \\"Dodek.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ7hxz5PpYY Biographical notes He was arguably the most popular Polish comic actor of the 1930s, Andrzej Wajda remarked once, that for him Dymsza was a symbol of pre-war Polish cinema in general. Life Dymsza was born Adolf Bagi≈Ñski on 7 April 1900 in Warsaw, then in Russian Empire, to Adolf Sr. and Matylda n√©e Po≈ÇƒÖdkiewicz. At the age of 15 he worked as a busboy in some of Warsaw's cabarets. He graduated from a local II Gymnasium and then studied at the Hipolit Wawelberg's Trade School. During World War I and the subsequent Polish-Bolshevik War he started his career as a dancer in cabarets and theatres of Warsaw, Minsk and Grodno. He returned to Warsaw after the war, but no theatre would hire him and he spend several years giving dance lessons and occasionally singing in cabarets. It is speculated that he might have appeared in a number of silent films in that period, none of them survive to our times however. His debut came in 1925, when he was hired by the famous Qui Pro Quo cabaret as a singer and dancer, \\"immediately conquering the audience with his natural juvenile wit and temperamental performances of Warsaw street types.\\" He remained part of Qui Pro Quo's crew until 1931, appearing on stage along such stars of contemporary Polish cabaret and cinema as Marian Hemar, Eugeniusz Bodo, Hanka Ordon√≥wna, Mieczys≈Çaw Fogg, Mira Zimi≈Ñska, Zula Pogorzelska and Fryderyk Jarosy. Initially rarely seen on screen, Dymsza first made a name for himself as an excellent comedian in Warsaw's cabarets in the 1920s. In 1930 he starred in the first of his films: the Wiatr od morza and Niebezpieczny romans. Altogether, in the inter-war period, Dymsza appeared in 24 feature sound films, acting the leads for the most part. Many of them were cheap comedies and farces, replete with songs and music and a few excellent actors such as Adolf Dymsza. Modern critics consider some of those films remarkable only because of the performance of Dymsza. A popular actor in film comedies, he recorded very few of the great hits from his cabaret and film performances. After the German and Soviet invasions of Poland, Dymsza ignored the Polish actors' boycott and worked in the Nazi-administered cabarets of Warsaw. > \\"Yet, after 1945 when Second World War was over, his disloyal attitude to > the patriotic attitude was quickly forgotten by Polish fans of his talent. > Perhaps, need to laugh again was strong enough in the society so deeply > traumatised by the atrocities of war, and Dymsza's talent in evoking happy- > go-lucky air of the past Warsaw street was highly desirable.

A series of murders that took place in the East End of London from August to November 1888 was blamed on an unidentified assailant who was nicknamed Jack the Ripper. Since that time, the identity of the killer or killers has been widely debated, and over 100 Jack the Ripper suspects have been named.Whiteway, Ken (2004). \\"A Guide to the Literature of Jack the Ripper\\". Canadian Law Library Review vol.29 pp. 219‚Äì229Eddleston, pp. 195‚Äì244 Though many theories have been advanced, experts find none widely persuasive, and some are hardly taken seriously at all. Due to the passage of time since the murders took place, the killer will likely never be identified despite the killer's identity continuing to be a hot topic of discussion. Contemporaneous police opinion Metropolitan Police Service files show that their investigation into the serial killings encompassed 11 separate murders between 1888 and 1891, known in the police docket as the \\"Whitechapel murders\\". Five of these‚Äîthe murders of Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly‚Äîare generally agreed to be the work of a single killer, known as \\"Jack the Ripper\\". These murders occurred between August and November 1888 within a short distance of each other, and are collectively known as the \\"canonical five\\". The six other murders‚Äîthose of Emma Elizabeth Smith, Martha Tabram, Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, Frances Coles, and an unidentified woman‚Äîhave been linked with Jack the Ripper to varying degrees. The swiftness of the attacks, and the manner of the mutilations performed on some of the bodies, which included disembowelment and removal of organs, led to speculation that the murderer had the skills of a physician or butcher.e.g. Dr Winslow, the examining pathologist, quoted in Haggard, Robert F. (1993). \\"Jack the Ripper As the Threat of Outcast London\\" . Essays in History. Volume 35. Corcoran Department of History at the University of Virginia. Accessed 17 July 2008 However, others disagreed strongly, and thought the wounds too crude to be professional.e.g. Letter from Thomas Bond to Robert Anderson, 10 November 1888, quoted in Rumbelow, pp. 145‚Äì147; Dr Percy Clark, assistant to George Bagster Phillips interviewed in the East London Observer, 14 May 1910, quoted in Cook, Jack the Ripper, p. 187 and Evans and Rumbelow, p. 238 The alibis of local butchers and slaughterers were investigated, with the result that they were eliminated from the enquiry.Rumbelow, p. 274; Inspector Donald Swanson's report to the Home Office, 19 October 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 206 Over 2,000 people were interviewed, \\"upwards of 300\\" people were investigated, and 80 people were detained.Inspector Donald Swanson's report to the Home Office, 19 October 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 205; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 113; Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 125 During the course of their investigations of the murders, police regarded several men as strong suspects, though none was ever formally charged. =Montague John Druitt= Montague John DruittMontague John Druitt (15 August 1857 ‚Äì early December 1888) was a Dorset-born barrister who worked to supplement his income as an assistant schoolmaster in Blackheath, London, until his dismissal shortly before his suicide by drowning in 1888.Rumbelow, p. 155 His decomposed body was found floating in the Thames near Chiswick on 31 December 1888. Some modern authors suggest that Druitt may have been dismissed because he was a homosexual and that this could have driven him to commit suicide.Marriott, pp. 233‚Äì234 However, both his mother and his grandmother suffered mental health problems,Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 260 and it is possible that he was dismissed because of an underlying hereditary psychiatric illness. His death shortly after the last canonical murder (which took place on 9 November 1888) led Assistant Chief Constable Sir Melville Macnaghten to name him as a suspect in a memorandum of 23 February 1894. However, Macnaghten incorrectly described the 31-year-old barrister as a 41-year-old doctor.Fido, p. 203; Marriott, pp. 231‚Äì234; Rumbelow, p. 157 On 1 September, the day after the first canonical murder, Druitt was in Dorset playing cricket, and most experts now believe that the killer was local to Whitechapel, whereas Druitt lived miles away on the other side of the Thames in Kent.Marriott, p. 223 Inspector Frederick Abberline appeared to dismiss Druitt as a serious suspect on the basis that the only evidence against him was the coincidental timing of his suicide shortly after the last canonical murder.Interview in the Pall Mall Gazette, 31 March 1903, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 264 =Seweryn K≈Çosowski= Seweryn K≈ÇosowskiSeweryn Antonowicz K≈Çosowski (alias George Chapman‚Äîno relation to victim Annie Chapman) (14 December 1865 ‚Äì 7 April 1903) was born in Congress Poland, but emigrated to the United Kingdom sometime between 1887 and 1888, shortly before the start of the Whitechapel murders. Between 1893 and 1894 he assumed the name of Chapman. He successively poisoned three of his wives and became known as \\"the borough poisoner\\". He was hanged for his crimes in 1903. At the time of the Ripper murders, he lived in Whitechapel, London, where he had been working as a barber under the name Ludwig Schloski.Rumbelow, pp. 188‚Äì193; Sugden, p. 441. According to H. L. Adam, who wrote a book on the poisonings in 1930, Chapman was Inspector Frederick Abberline's favoured suspect,Adam, Hargrave Lee (1930), The Trial of George Chapman, William Hodge, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 281; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 229; Fido, p. 177; and Rumbelow, p. 193 and the Pall Mall Gazette reported that Abberline suspected Chapman after his conviction.Pall Mall Gazette, 24 March 1903 and 31 March 1903, quoted in Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 646‚Äì651 However, others disagree that Chapman is a likely culprit, as he murdered his three wives with poison, and it is uncommon (though not unheard of) for a serial killer to make such a drastic change in modus operandi.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 282; Cullen, p. 204; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 229; Marriott, p. 247; Rumbelow, p. 195; Detective Inspector Edmund Reid quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 237 =Aaron Kosminski= Aaron Kosminski (born Aron Mordke Kozminski; 11 September 1865 ‚Äì 24 March 1919) was a Polish Jew who was admitted to Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum in 1891.Colney Hatch Register of Admissions, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 269 \\"Kosminski\\" (without a forename) was named as a suspect by Sir Melville Macnaghten in his 1894 memorandumMacnaghten's notes quoted by Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 584‚Äì587; Fido, pp. 147‚Äì148 and Rumbelow, p. 142 and by former Chief Inspector Donald Swanson in handwritten comments in the margin of his copy of Assistant Commissioner Sir Robert Anderson's memoirs.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 269; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 243; Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 635; Rumbelow, p. 179 Anderson wrote that a Polish Jew had been identified as the Ripper but that no prosecution was possible because the witness was also Jewish and refused to testify against a fellow Jew.Quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 266; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 236; Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 626‚Äì633 and Fido, p. 169 Some authors are sceptical of this, while others use it in their theories.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 276; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 249‚Äì253; Rumbelow, p. 182 In his memorandum, Macnaghten stated that no one was ever identified as the Ripper, which directly contradicts Anderson's recollection.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 255 In 1987, author Martin Fido searched asylum records for any inmates called Kosminski, and found only one: Aaron Kosminski. Kosminski lived in Whitechapel;Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 269‚Äì270; Marriott, p. 238; Fido, p. 215 however, he was largely harmless in the asylum. His insanity took the form of auditory hallucinations, a paranoid fear of being fed by other people, a refusal to wash or bathe, and \\"self-abuse\\".Asylum case notes quoted by Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 270 and Fido, pp. 216, 228 In his book The Cases That Haunt Us, former FBI profiler John Douglas states that a paranoid individual such as Kosminski would likely have openly boasted of the murders while incarcerated had he been the killer, but there is no record that he ever did so.Douglas, John; Olshaker, Mark (2001). The Cases That Haunt Us. New York: Simon and Schuster. pp. 89. In 2014, DNA analysis tenuously linked Kosminski with a shawl said to have belonged to victim Catherine Eddowes, but experts ‚Äì including Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, the inventor of genetic fingerprinting ‚Äì dismissed the claims as unreliable.\\"Jack the Ripper: Scientist who claims to have identified notorious killer has 'made serious DNA error'\\", The Independent, 19 October 2014 In March 2019, the Journal of Forensic Sciences published a study that claimed DNA from Kosminski and Catherine Eddowes was found on the shawl, though other scientists have cast doubt on the study. =Michael Ostrog= Michael OstrogMichael Ostrog (c. 1833‚Äìin or after 1904) was a Russian-born professional con man and thief. He used numerous aliases and assumed titles.Sugden, p. 433 Among his many dubious claims was that he had once been a surgeon in the Russian Navy. He was mentioned as a suspect by Macnaghten, who joined the case in 1889, the year after the \\"canonical five\\" victims were killed. Researchers have failed to find evidence that he had committed crimes any more serious than fraud and theft.Marriott, p. 250 Author Philip Sugden discovered prison records showing that Ostrog was jailed for petty offences in France during the Ripper murders.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 277; Sugden, pp. xix Ostrog was last mentioned alive in 1904; the date of his death is unknown.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 277; Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 591 =John Pizer= John PizerJohn Pizer or Piser (c. 1850‚Äì1897) was a Polish Jew who worked as a bootmaker in Whitechapel. In the early days of the Whitechapel murders, many locals suspected that \\"Leather Apron\\" was the killer, which was picked up by the press, and Pizer was known as \\"Leather Apron\\". He had a prior conviction for a stabbing offence, and Police Sergeant William Thicke apparently believed that he had committed a string of minor assaults on prostitutes.Marriott, p. 251 After the murders of Mary Ann Nichols and Annie Chapman in late August and early September 1888 respectively, Thicke arrested Pizer on 10 September, even though the investigating inspector reported that \\"there is no evidence whatsoever against him\\".Report by Inspector Joseph Helson, CID 'J' Division, in the Metropolitan Police archive, MEPO 3/140 ff. 235‚Äì8, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 99 and Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 24 He was cleared of suspicion when it turned out that he had alibis for two of the murders. He was staying with relatives at the time of one of the canonical murders, and he was talking with a police officer while watching a spectacular fire on the London Docks at the time of another.Rumbelow, p. 49 Pizer and Thicke had known each other for years,Whitehead and Rivett, p. 48 and Pizer implied that his arrest was based on animosity rather than evidence. Pizer successfully obtained monetary compensation from at least one newspaper that had named him as the murderer.O'Connor, T. P. (1929). Memoirs of an Old Parliamentarian. London: Ernest Benn. Vol. 2, p. 257, quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 166 and Cook, Jack the Ripper, pp. 72‚Äì73 Thicke himself was accused of being the Ripper by H. T. Haslewood of Tottenham in a letter to the Home Office dated 10 September 1889; the presumably malicious accusation was dismissed as without foundation.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 213 =James Thomas Sadler= James Thomas Sadler was a friend of Frances Coles, the last victim added to the Whitechapel murders police file. Coles murdered on 13 February 1891. Her body was discovered beneath a railway arch in Swallow Gardens, Whitechapel. Two deep slash wounds had been inflicted to her neck. She was still alive, but died before medical help could arrive.Cook, pp. 53‚Äì55; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 218‚Äì219; Evans and Skinner (2000), p. 551 Sadler was arrested, but little evidence existed against him. Though briefly considered by the police as a Ripper suspect, he was at sea at the time of the first four \\"canonical\\" murders, and was released without charge.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 218‚Äì222; Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 141 Sadler was named in Macnaghten's 1894 memorandum in connection with Coles's murder. Macnaghten thought Sadler \\"was a man of ungovernable temper and entirely addicted to drink, and the company of the lowest prostitutes\\".Macnaghten's notes quoted in Rumbelow, p. 143 =Francis Tumblety= Francis TumbletyFrancis Tumblety (c. 1833‚Äì1903) earned a small fortune posing as an \\"Indian Herb\\" doctor throughout the United States and Canada, and was commonly perceived as a misogynist and a quack.Rumbelow, p. 266; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126 He was connected to the death of one of his patients,Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 611‚Äì616; Rumbelow, p. 266; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126 but escaped prosecution.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 126 In 1865, he was arrested for alleged complicity in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, but no connection was found and he was released without being charged.Roscoe, Theodore (1959) The Web of Conspiracy, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., pp. 301‚Äì302, 502. Tumblety was in England in 1888, and was arrested on 7 November, apparently for engaging in homosexual acts, which were illegal at the time.Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 621 It was reported by some of his friends that he showed off a collection of \\"matrices\\" (wombs) from \\"every class of woman\\" at around this time.Sugden, pp. xxv Awaiting trial, he fled to France and then to the United States.News dispatch in Ludington Record, 20 December 1888. Already notorious in the States for his self-promotion and previous criminal charges, his arrest was reported as connected to the Ripper murders.\\"Something About Dr. Tumblety.\\" The New York Times, 23 November 1888, quoted in Rumbelow, p. 266 American reports that Scotland Yard tried to extradite him were not confirmed by the British press or the London police,Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 616 and the New York City Police said, \\"there is no proof of his complicity in the Whitechapel murders, and the crime for which he is under bond in London is not extraditable\\".Chief Inspector Byrnes quoted in Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 280 In 1913, Tumblety was mentioned as a Ripper suspect by Chief Inspector John Littlechild of the Metropolitan Police Service in a letter to journalist and author George R. Sims.Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 203 Contemporaneous press and public opinion The Whitechapel murders were featured heavily in the media, and attracted the attention of Victorian society at large. Journalists, letter writers, and amateur detectives all suggested names either in press or to the police. Most were not and could not be taken seriously.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 165; Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 105; Rumbelow, pp. 105‚Äì116 For example, at the time of the murders, Richard Mansfield, a famous actor, starred in a theatrical version of Robert Louis Stevenson's book Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The subject matter of horrific murder in the London streets and Mansfield's convincing portrayal led letter writers to accuse him of being the Ripper.Letter dated 5 October 1888 from \\"M.P.\\" to City of London Police, Corporation of London Records Office, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 277 and Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 149; letter dated 4 October 1888 from Mrs S Luckett of 10 Somerford Grove to City of London Police, Corporation of London Records Office, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 283 =William Henry Bury= William Henry BuryWilliam Henry Bury (25 May 1859 ‚Äì 24 April 1889) had recently moved to Dundee from the East End of London, when he strangled his wife Ellen Elliott, a former prostitute, on 4 February 1889. He inflicted extensive wounds to her abdomen after she was dead and packed the body into a trunk. On 10 February, Bury went to the local police and told them his wife had committed suicide. He was arrested, tried, found guilty of her murder, and hanged in Dundee. A link with the Ripper crimes was investigated by police, but Bury denied any connection, despite making a full confession to his wife's homicide. Nevertheless, the executioner, James Berry, promoted the idea that Bury was the Ripper.Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, pp. 207‚Äì208 =Thomas Neill Cream= Dr Thomas Neil CreamDr. Thomas Neill Cream (27 May 1850 ‚Äì 15 November 1892) was a doctor secretly specialising in abortions. He was born in Glasgow, educated in London and Canada, and entered practice in Canada and later in Chicago, Illinois. In 1881 he was found guilty of the fatal poisoning of his mistress's husband.Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 209 He was imprisoned in the Illinois State Penitentiary in Joliet, Illinois, from November 1881 until his release on good behaviour on 31 July 1891. He moved to London, where he resumed killing and was soon arrested. He was hanged on 15 November 1892 at Newgate Prison. According to some sources, his last words were reported as being \\"I am Jack the...\\", interpreted to mean Jack the Ripper.Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 212; Rumbelow, p. 206 However, police officials who attended the execution made no mention of this alleged interrupted confession. As he was still imprisoned at the time of the Ripper murders, most authorities consider it impossible for him to have been the culprit. However, Donald Bell suggested that he could have bribed officials and left the prison before his official release,Bell, Donald (1974), \\"Jack the Ripper ‚Äì The Final Solution?\\", The Criminologist vol. 9, no. 33, quoted in Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 212 and Rumbelow, pp. 206‚Äì207 and Sir Edward Marshall-Hall suspected that his prison term may have been served by a look- alike in his place.Marjoribanks, Edward, The Life of Sir Edward Marshall Hall, quoted in Rumbelow, p. 208 Such notions are unlikely, and contradict evidence given by the Illinois authorities, newspapers of the time, Cream's solicitors, Cream's family and Cream himself.Rumbelow, pp. 206‚Äì208 =Thomas Hayne Cutbush= Thomas Hayne Cutbush (1865‚Äì1903) was a medical student sent to Lambeth Infirmary in 1891 suffering delusions thought to have been caused by syphilis.Rumbelow, pp. 141‚Äì142 After stabbing a woman in the backside and attempting to stab a second he was pronounced insane and committed to Broadmoor Hospital in 1891, where he remained until his death in 1903. In a series of articles in 1894, The Sun newspaper suggested that Cutbush was the Ripper. There is no evidence that police took the idea seriously, and Melville Macnaghten's memorandum naming the three police suspects Druitt, Kosminski and Ostrog was written to refute the idea that Cutbush was the Ripper.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, p. 284; Cook, pp. 198‚Äì199; Marriott, p. 235; Rumbelow, pp. 141‚Äì142; Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 105, 110 Cutbush was the suspect advanced in the 1993 book Jack the Myth by A. P. Wolf, who suggested that Macnaghten wrote his memo to protect Cutbush's uncle, a fellow police officer.Quoted in Whitehead and Rivett, p. 110 Another recent writer, Peter Hodgson, considers Cutbush the most likely candidate.Hodgson, Peter Jack the Ripper Through the Mists of Time David Bullock also firmly believes Cutbush to be the real Ripper in his book.Bullock, David The Man Who Would Be Jack: The Hunt for the Real Ripper =Frederick Bailey Deeming= Frederick Bailey DeemingFrederick Bailey Deeming (30 July 1853 ‚Äì 23 May 1892) murdered his first wife and four children in Rainhill near St. Helens, Lancashire, in 1891. His crimes went undiscovered and later that year he emigrated to Australia with his second wife, whom he then also murdered. Her body was found buried under their house, and the subsequent investigation led to the discovery of the other bodies in England. He was arrested, sent to trial, and found guilty. He wrote in a book, and later boasted in jail that he was Jack the Ripper, but he was either imprisonedFido, p. 182; Rumbelow, p. 268 or in South AfricaEvans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 214 at the time of the Ripper murders. The police denied any connection between Deeming and the Ripper.Pall Mall Gazette, 8 April 1892, quoted in Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 577‚Äì578 He was hanged in Melbourne. According to Robert Napper, a former Scotland Yard detective, the British police did not consider him a suspect because of his two possible alibis but Napper believed Deeming was not in jail at the time, and there is some evidence that he was back in England.Prime Suspect, Jack The Ripper, Discovery channel, 2011, Narration by Dennis Cometti =Carl Feigenbaum= Carl Ferdinand Feigenbaum (executed 27 April 1896) was a German merchant seaman arrested in 1894 in New York City for cutting the throat of Mrs Juliana Hoffmann. After his execution, his lawyer, William Sanford Lawton, claimed that Feigenbaum had admitted to having a hatred of women and a desire to kill and mutilate them. Lawton further stated that he believed Feigenbaum was Jack the Ripper. Though covered by the press at the time, the idea was not pursued for more than a century. Using Lawton's accusation as a base, author Trevor Marriott, a former British murder squad detective, argued that Feigenbaum was responsible for the Ripper murders as well as other murders in the United States and Germany between 1891 and 1894.In the second edition of his book, Jack The Ripper: The 21st Century Investigation (John Blake Publishing, 2007) According to Wolf Vanderlinden, some of the murders listed by Marriott did not actually occur; the newspapers often embellished or created Ripper-like stories to boost sales. Lawton's accusations were disputed by a partner in his legal firm, Hugh O. Pentecost, and there is no proof that Feigenbaum was in Whitechapel at the time of the murders.Vanderlinden, Wolf (2008). \\"Carl Ferdinand Feigenbaum: An Old Suspect Resurfaces\\", in Ripper Notes: The Legend Continues, Inklings Press, pp. 4‚Äì24, Xanth√© Mallett, a Scottish forensic anthropologist and criminologist who investigated the case in 2011, wrote there is considerable doubt that all of the Jack the Ripper murders were committed by the same person. She concludes that \\"Feigenbaum could have been responsible for one, some or perhaps all\\" of the Whitechapel murders. =Robert Donston Stephenson= Robert Donston StephensonRobert Donston Stephenson (also known as Roslyn D'Onston) (20 April 1841 ‚Äì 9 October 1916) was a journalist and writer interested in the occult and black magic. He admitted himself as a patient at the London Hospital in Whitechapel shortly before the murders started, and left shortly after they ceased. He wrote a newspaper article in which he claimed that black magic was the motive for the killings and alleged that the Ripper was a Frenchman.Woods and Baddeley, pp. 179‚Äì181 Stephenson's strange manner and interest in the crimes resulted in an amateur detective reporting him to Scotland Yard on Christmas Eve, 1888.Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 608‚Äì609 Two days later Stephenson reported his own suspect, a Dr Morgan Davies of the London Hospital.Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 606‚Äì608 Subsequently, he fell under the suspicion of newspaper editor William Thomas Stead. In his books on the case, author and historian Melvin Harris argued that Stephenson was a leading suspect,Rumbelow, pp. 254‚Äì258; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 181‚Äì182 but the police do not appear to have treated either him or Dr Davies as serious suspects.Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 204 London Hospital night-shift rosters and practices indicate that Stephenson was not able to leave on the nights of the murders and hence could not have been Jack the Ripper.Dimolianis, chapter 4 Proposed by later authors Suspects proposed years after the murders include virtually anyone remotely connected to the case by contemporary documents, as well as many famous names, who were not considered in the police investigation at all. As everyone alive at the time is now dead, modern authors are free to accuse anyone they can, \\"without any need for any supporting historical evidence\\".Evans and Rumbelow, p. 261 Most of their suggestions cannot be taken seriously, and include English novelist George Gissing, British prime minister William Ewart Gladstone, and syphilitic artist Frank Miles. =Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale= Prince AlbertPrince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale (8 January 1864 ‚Äì 14 January 1892) was first mentioned in print as a potential suspect when Philippe Jullian's biography of Clarence's father, King Edward VII, was published in 1962. Jullian made a passing reference to rumours that Clarence might have been responsible for the murders. Though Jullian did not detail the dates or sources of the rumour, it is possible that the rumour derived indirectly from Dr. Thomas E. A. Stowell. In 1960, Stowell told the rumour to writer Colin Wilson, who in turn told Harold Nicolson, a biographer loosely credited as a source of \\"hitherto unpublished anecdotes\\" in Jullian's book. Nicolson could have communicated Stowell's theory to Jullian.Evans, Stewart P. (October 2002). \\"On the Origins of the Royal Conspiracy Theory\\". Ripper Notes. Published online by Casebook: Jack the Ripper. Accessed 6 May 2008.Cook, Andrew (2006). Prince Eddy: The King Britain Never Had. Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus Publishing Ltd. . pp. 8‚Äì9 The theory was brought to major public attention in 1970 when an article by Stowell was published in The Criminologist that revealed his suspicion that Clarence had committed the murders after being driven mad by syphilis. The suggestion was widely dismissed, as Albert Victor had strong alibis for the murders, and it is unlikely that he suffered from syphilis.e.g. Rumbelow, pp. 211‚Äì213 Stowell later denied implying that Clarence was the RipperStowell, T. E. A. (9 November 1970). \\"Jack the Ripper\\". The Times p. 9; Issue 58018; col.F but efforts to investigate his claims further were hampered, as Stowell was elderly, and he died from natural causes just days after the publication of his article. The same week, Stowell's son reported that he had burned his father's papers, saying \\"I read just sufficient to make certain that there was nothing of importance.\\"PHS (14 November 1970). \\"The Times Diary: Ripper file destroyed\\". The Times p. 12; Issue 58023; col.E Subsequently, conspiracy theorists, such as Stephen Knight in Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution, have elaborated on the supposed involvement of Clarence in the murders. Rather than implicate Albert Victor directly, they claim that he secretly married and had a daughter with a Catholic shop assistant, and that Queen Victoria, British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury, his Freemason friends, and the Metropolitan Police conspired to murder anyone aware of Albert Victor's supposed child. Many facts contradict this theory and its originator, Joseph Gorman (also known as Joseph Sickert), later retracted the story and admitted to the press that it was a hoax.The Sunday Times, 18 June 1978, quoted in Rumbelow, p. 237 Variations of the theory involve the physician Sir William Gull, the artist Walter Sickert, and the poet James Kenneth Stephen to greater or lesser degrees, and have been fictionalised in novels and films, such as Murder by Decree and From Hell. =Joseph Barnett= Joseph BarnettJoseph Barnett (c. 1858‚Äì1927) was a former fish porter, and victim Mary Kelly's lover from 8 April 1887 to 30 October 1888, when they quarrelled and separated after he lost his job and she returned to prostitution to make a living. Inspector Abberline questioned him for four hours after Kelly's murder, and his clothes were examined for bloodstains, but he was then released without charge. A century after the murders, author Bruce Paley proposed him as a suspect as Kelly's scorned or jealous lover, and suggested that he'd committed the other murders to scare Kelly off the streets and out of prostitution.Rumbelow, p. 262; Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 122‚Äì123 Other authors suggest he killed Kelly only, and mutilated the body to make it look like a Ripper murder, but Abberline's investigation appears to have exonerated him.Rumbelow, p. 262 Other acquaintances of Kelly put forward as her murderer include her landlord John McCarthy and her former boyfriend Joseph Fleming.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 123 =Lewis Carroll= Lewis Caroll Lewis Carroll (pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) (27 January 1832 ‚Äì 14 January 1898) was the author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. He was named as a suspect based upon anagrams which author Richard Wallace devised for his book Jack the Ripper, Light-Hearted Friend.Was Lewis Carroll Jack the Ripper?; Oxford Mail; 24 February 1999 Wallace argues that Carroll had a psychotic breakdown after being assaulted by a man when he was 12 and became an angry man. Moreover, according to Wallace, Carroll wrote a diary every day in purple ink, but on the days of the Whitechapel killings, he switched to black. This claim is not taken seriously by scholars.Woods and Baddeley, p. 61 =David Cohen= David Cohen (1865 ‚Äì 20 October 1889) was a 23-year-old Polish Jew whose incarceration at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum on 7 December 1888 roughly coincided with the end of the murders.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Facts, p. 385 Described as violently antisocial, the poor East End local was suggested as a suspect by author and Ripperologist Martin Fido in his book The Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper (1987). Fido claimed that the name \\"David Cohen\\" was used at the time to refer to a Jewish immigrant who either could not be positively identified or whose name was too difficult for police to spell, in the same fashion that \\"John Doe\\" is used in the United States today.Fido quoted in Rumbelow, pp. 180‚Äì181 Fido identified Cohen with \\"Leather Apron\\" (see John Pizer above), and speculated that Cohen's true identity was Nathan Kaminsky, a bootmaker living in Whitechapel who had been treated at one time for syphilis and who could not be traced after mid-1888‚Äîthe same time that Cohen appeared.Fido, pp. 215‚Äì219 Fido believed that police officials confused the name Kaminsky with Kosminski, resulting in the wrong man coming under suspicion (see Aaron Kosminski above). Cohen exhibited violent, destructive tendencies while at the asylum, and had to be restrained. He died at the asylum in October 1889.Fido, p. 220 In his book The Cases That Haunt Us, former FBI criminal profiler John Douglas has asserted that behavioural clues gathered from the murders all point to a person \\"known to the police as David Cohen ... or someone very much like him\\". =William Withey Gull= Sir William Withey GullSir William Withey Gull (31 December 1816 ‚Äì 29 January 1890) was physician-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria. He was named as the Ripper as part of the evolution of the widely discredited Masonic/royal conspiracy theory outlined in such books as Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution. Coachman John Netley has been named as his accomplice. Thanks to the popularity of this theory among fiction writers and for its dramatic nature, Gull shows up as the Ripper in a number of books and films including the TV film Jack the Ripper (1988), Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's graphic novel From Hell (1999), and its 2001 film adaptation, in which Ian Holm plays Gull. Conventional historians have never taken Gull seriously as a suspect due to sheer lack of evidence; in addition, he was in his seventies at the time of the murders and had recently suffered a stroke. =George Hutchinson= George Hutchinson was an unemployed labourer. On 12 November 1888, he made a formal statement to the London police that in the early hours of 9 November 1888, Mary Jane Kelly approached him in the street and asked him for money. He stated that he had then followed her and another man of conspicuous appearance to her room, and had watched the room for about three-quarters of an hour without seeing either leave. He gave a very detailed description of the man, claiming he was \\"of Jewish appearance\\", despite the darkness of that night.Cullen, p. 180; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 190‚Äì192; Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 376‚Äì377; Fido, p. 96; Marriott, p. 263 The accuracy of Hutchinson's statement was disputed among the senior police. Inspector Frederick Abberline, after interviewing Hutchinson, believed that Hutchinson's account was truthful.Inspector Abberline's report, 12 November 1888, Metropolitan police archives, MEPO 3/140 ff. 230‚Äì2, quoted in Begg,Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History, pp. 238‚Äì239 and Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 377‚Äì378 However, Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who got a good look at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness.Cook, Jack the Ripper, p. 176 Hutchinson's statement was made on the day that Mary Kelly's inquest was held, and he was not called to testify. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself, trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.Marriott, p. 263 =James Kelly= James KellyJames Kelly (20 April 1860 ‚Äì 17 September 1929) was first identified as a suspect in Terence Sharkey's Jack the Ripper. 100 Years of Investigation (Ward Lock 1987) and documented in Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper, by Jim Tully, in 1997.Tully, Jim, Prisoner 1167: The madman who was Jack the Ripper . James Kelly murdered his wife in 1883 by stabbing her in the neck. Deemed insane, he was committed to the Broadmoor Asylum, from which he later escaped in early 1888, using a key he fashioned himself. After the last of the five canonical Ripper murders in London in November 1888, the police searched for Kelly at what had been his residence prior to his wife's murder, but they were not able to locate him. In 1927, almost forty years after his escape, he unexpectedly turned himself in to officials at the Broadmoor Asylum. He died two years later, presumably of natural causes. Retired New York Police Department cold- case detective Ed Norris examined the Jack the Ripper case for a Discovery Channel programme called Jack the Ripper in America. In it, Norris claims that James Kelly was Jack the Ripper, and that he was also responsible for multiple murders in cities around the United States. Norris highlights a few features of the Kelly story to support his contention. Norris reported Kelly's Broadmoor Asylum file from before his escape and his eventual return has never been opened since 1927 until Norris was given special permission for access to it, and that the file is the perfect profile match for Jack the Ripper.Ripperology: A Study of the World's First Serial Killer And a Literary Phenomenon pp. 194‚Äì195 =Charles Allen Lechmere= Charles LechmereCharles Allen Lechmere (5 October 1849 ‚Äì 23 December 1920), also known as Charles Cross, was a meat cart driver for the Pickfords company, and is conventionally regarded as an innocent witness who discovered the body of the first canonical Ripper victim, Mary Ann Nichols. In a documentary titled Jack the Ripper: The New Evidence, Swedish journalist Christer Holmgren and criminologist Gareth Norris of Aberystwyth University, with assistance from former detective Andy Griffiths, proposed that Lechmere was the Ripper. According to Holmgren, Lechmere lied to police, claiming that he had been with Nichols's body for a few minutes, whereas research on his route to work from his home demonstrated that he must have been with her for about nine minutes. When Lechmere called over Robert Paul to look at her, no blood was visible, but by the time a constable found her shortly afterward, a pool had formed around her neck, suggesting the cut to her throat was extremely fresh when Lechmere and Paul were present. He also refused Paul's suggestion to prop her up, which would have instantly made it clear that her throat had been cut. In addition, neither man reported seeing or hearing anyone else in Buck's Row, which had no side exits. Her injuries were also hidden under her clothing, whereas the Ripper typically left the wounds displayed. It was theorized that Lechmere had killed Nichols and begun the process of mutilating her body when he heard Paul's footsteps, and then rushed to portray himself as the discoverer of her body. Lechmere did not come forward until Paul mentioned him to the press, and he gave evidence under the name \\"Charles Cross\\" at the inquest; Cross was the surname of a stepfather. Lechmere's home address, visits to family, and route to work link him to the times and places of murders; he passed three streets where Martha Tabram, Polly Nichols, and Annie Chapman were murdered roughly at the same time the murders are estimated to have occurred. The \\"Double Event\\" murders of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes occurred on a Saturday, his only night off from work: Stride was killed near Lechmere's mother's house in an area he grew up in, and the direct route from Stride's murder scene to the location of Eddowes's murder followed a path to Lechmere's route to work that he had used for twenty years. Mary Kelly was also murdered on his route to work, and the time frame in which she is estimated to have been killed matches his route, although the day she was killed was a holiday and he may have had the day off. Lechmere's family background is also similar to that of many serial killers: he grew up in a \\"broken home\\"; having never known his biological father, he had two stepfathers; and his childhood was characterized by an instability of residence, growing up in a series of different homes. In addition, his occupation as a meat cart driver would have allowed his blood- splattered appearance to escape suspicion. Holmgren believes that Lechmere may have been responsible for several other murders in addition to those of the canonical five victims and Martha Tabram. =Jacob Levy= Jacob Levy (1856 ‚Äì 29 July 1891) was born in Aldgate in 1856. He followed in his father's trade as a butcher, and by 1888 he was living in Middlesex Street with his wife and children, which was right in the heart of Ripper territory (and close to where Catherine Eddowes was murdered). Levy contracted syphilis from a prostitute, making revenge a probable motive, and he was a butcher with the necessary skills to remove certain organs from the victims.Roland, Paul The Crimes of Jack the Ripper: The Whitechapel Murders Re-Examined pp. 276‚Äì278 The 2009 video game Sherlock Holmes Versus Jack the Ripper uses a combination of historically attested and embellished evidence to propose his candidacy. =James Maybrick= Florence and James MaybrickJames Maybrick (24 October 1838 ‚Äì 11 May 1889) was a Liverpool cotton merchant. His wife Florence was convicted of poisoning him with arsenic in a sensational, and possibly unjust, trial presided over by Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, the father of another modern suspect James Kenneth Stephen.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 124 In her book, Jack the Ripper: The American Connection author Shirley Harrison asserted James Maybrick was both Jack the Ripper and the Servant Girl Annihilator of Austin, Texas. A diary purportedly by Maybrick, published in the 1990s by Michael Barrett, contains a confession to the Ripper murders. In 1995, Barrett confessed to writing the diary himself, and described the process of counterfeiting the diary in detail. He swore under oath that he and his wife, Anne, had forged it.Affidavit of Michael Barrett, 5 January 1995, quoted in Marriott, pp. 272‚Äì277 Anne Barrett, after their divorce, later denied forgery, and their story changed several times over the years. The diary was discredited by historians who pointed to factual errors in relation to some of the crimes,Whitehead and Rivett, p. 125 and document experts pronounced the diary a fake; the handwriting does not match that of Maybrick's will,Marriott, p. 272; Rumbelow, pp. 252‚Äì253 and the ink contains a preservative not marketed until 1974.Rumbelow, p. 251 =Michael Maybrick= Michael Maybrick (31 January 1841 ‚Äì 26 August 1913) was an English composer and singer best known under his pseudonym Stephen Adams as the composer of \\"The Holy City\\". In his book from 2015 They All Love Jack: Busting the Ripper Bruce Robinson documents how this suspect frequented the Whitechapel area where the murders took place and investigates a description of a man seen by Matthew Packer on the night of the murder of Elizabeth Stride who resembled Michael Maybrick. The suspect's profession meant he frequently travelled around the UK and the dates and locations of his performances coincide with when and where the letters to the police were sent from. The suspect's presence in Bradford around Christmas 1888 also coincides with the murder of a seven-year-old boy, Johnnie Gill, a murder which the Ripper had foretold to police in a letter. =Alexander Pedachenko= Alexander Pedachenko (alleged dates 1857‚Äì1908) was named in the 1923 memoirs of William Le Queux, Things I Know about Kings, Celebrities and Crooks. Le Queux claimed to have seen a manuscript in French written by Rasputin stating that Jack the Ripper was an insane Russian doctor named Alexander Pedachenko, an agent of the Okhrana (the Secret Police of Imperial Russia), whose aim in committing the murders was to discredit Scotland Yard. He was supposedly assisted by two accomplices: \\"Levitski\\" and a tailoress called Winberg.Le Queux, quoted in Rumbelow, p. 197 and Whitehead and Rivett, p. 103 However, there is no hard evidence that Pedachenko ever existed, and many parts of the story as recounted by Le Queux fall apart when examined closely.Begg, p. 309 For example, one of the sources named in the manuscript was a London-based Russian journalist called Nideroest, who was known for inventing sensational stories. Reviewers of Le Queux's book were aware of Nideroest's background, and unabashedly referred to him as an \\"unscrupulous liar\\".Quoted in Rumbelow, p. 198 Pedachenko was promoted as a suspect by Donald McCormick, who may have developed the story by adding his own inventions.Woods and Baddeley, p. 147 =Walter Sickert= Walter SickertWalter Richard Sickert (31 May 1860 ‚Äì 22 January 1942) was a German- born artist of British and Danish ancestry, who was first mentioned as a possible Ripper suspect in Donald McCormick's book The Identity of Jack the Ripper (1959).Knight, p. 250 He had a fascination with the Ripper murders, going so far as to stay in a room that was rumoured to have once had Jack the Ripper himself as a lodger, and depicted similar scenes in many of his paintings. Sickert subsequently appeared as a character in the royal/masonic conspiracy theory concocted by Joseph Gorman, who claimed to be Sickert's illegitimate son.Baron, Wendy (September 2004). \\"Sickert, Walter Richard (1860‚Äì1942)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Accessed 18 June 2008. (Subscription required) The theory was later developed by author Jean Overton Fuller, and by crime novelist Patricia Cornwell in her books Portrait of a Killer (2002) and Ripper: The Secret Life of Walter Sickert (2017). However, Sickert is not considered a serious suspect by most who study the case, and strong evidence shows he was in France at the time of most of the Ripper murders. Sturgis, Matthew (3 November 2002). \\"Making a killing from the Ripper\\". The Sunday Times Cornwell's allegation that Sickert was the Ripper was based on a DNA analysis of letters that had been sent to Scotland Yard, but \\"experts believe those letters to be fake\\" and \\"another genetic analysis of the letters claimed the murderer could have been a woman\\". =Joseph Silver= South African historian Charles van Onselen claimed, in the book The Fox and the Flies: The World of Joseph Silver, Racketeer and Psychopath (2007), that Joseph Silver, also known as Joseph Lis, a Polish Jew, was Jack the Ripper. Critics note, among other things, that van Onselen provides no evidence that Silver was ever in London during the time of the murders, and that the accusation is based entirely upon speculation. Van Onselen has responded by saying that the number of circumstances involved should make Silver a suspect. =James Kenneth Stephen= James Kenneth StephenJames Kenneth Stephen (25 February 1859 ‚Äì 3 February 1892) was first suggested as a suspect in a biography of another Ripper suspect, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale by Michael Harrison published in 1972. Harrison dismissed the idea that Albert Victor was the Ripper but instead suggested that Stephen, a poet and one of Albert Victor's tutors from Trinity College, Cambridge, was a more likely suspect. Harrison's suggestion was based on Stephen's misogynistic writings and on similarities between his handwriting and that of the \\"From Hell\\" letter, supposedly written by the Ripper. Harrison supposed that Stephen may have had sexual feelings for Albert Victor, and that Stephen's hatred of women arose from jealousy because Albert Victor preferred female company and did not reciprocate Stephen's feelings.Harrison, Michael (1972). Clarence: The life of H.R.H. the Duke of Clarence and Avondale (1864‚Äì1892). London and New York: W. H. Allen. . pp. 164‚Äì181 However, Harrison's analysis was rebutted by professional document examiners.Mann, Thomas J. (1975). World Association of Document Examiners Journal vol.2 no.1, quoted in Rumbelow, p. 219 There is no proof that Stephen was ever in love with Albert Victor,Aronson, Theo (1994). Prince Eddy and the Homosexual Underworld. London: John Murray. . p. 117 although he did starve himself to death very shortly after hearing of Albert Victor's death.Aronson, p. 105McDonald, Deborah The Prince, His Tutor and the Ripper 2007 McFarland Press Frank Spiering further developed the theory in his book Prince Jack (1978), which depicted Albert Victor as the murderer and Stephen as his lover. The book is widely dismissed as a sensational fiction based on previous theories rather than genuine historical research.Meikle, p. 177; Rumbelow, p. 244 and Trow, p. 153 Spiering claimed to have discovered a copy of some private notes written by another suspect, Sir William Gull, in the library of the New York Academy of Medicine and that the notes included a confession by Albert Victor under a state of hypnosis. Spiering further suggested that Albert Victor died due to an overdose of morphine, administered to him on the order of Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and possibly Albert Victor's own father, Edward VII of the United Kingdom. The New York Academy of Medicine denies possessing the records Spiering mentioned,Letter from the New York Academy of Medicine, 13 January 1986, quoted in Rumbelow, p. 244 and when Spiering was offered access to the Royal Archives, he retorted: \\"I don't want to see any files.\\"Spiering quoted in Rumbelow, p. 244 =Francis Thompson= Francis Thompson (18 December 1859 ‚Äì 13 November 1907) was an ascetic poet and opium addict with some medical training. Between 1885 and 1888 he spent some time homeless in the Docks area south of Whitechapel. He was proposed as a suspect in the 1999 book Paradox by Australian teacher Richard Patterson. =Sir John Williams= Sir John Williams Sir John Williams was obstetrician to Queen Victoria's daughter Princess Beatrice, and was accused of the Ripper crimes in the book, Uncle Jack (2005), written by one of the surgeon's descendants, Tony Williams, and Humphrey Price.Williams, Tony; Price, Humphrey (2005). Uncle Jack. London: Orion. The authors claim that the victims knew the doctor personally, that they were killed and mutilated in an attempt to research the causes of infertility, and that a badly blunted surgical knife, which belonged to Williams, was the murder weapon.Quoted in Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 128‚Äì129 Jennifer Pegg demonstrated in two articles that much of the research in the book was flawed; for example, the version of the notebook entry used to argue that Williams had met Ripper victim Mary Ann Nichols had been altered for print and did not match the original document, and the line as found in the original document was in handwriting that did not match the rest of the notebook.Pegg, Jennifer (October 2005). \\"Uncle Jack Under the Microscope\\".

Williams's wife, Lizzie, was named as a possible suspect by author John Morris, who claims that she was unable to have children and, in an unhinged state, took revenge on those who could by killing them.British author claims serial killer ‚ÄòJack the Ripper' was a woman in new book (9 May 2012), Herald Sun. Further theories Other named suspects include Swiss butcher Jacob Isenschmid, German hairdresser Charles Ludwig, apothecary and mental patient Oswald Puckridge (1838‚Äì1900), insane medical student John Sanders (1862‚Äì1901), Swedish tramp Nikaner Benelius, and even social reformer Thomas Barnardo, who claimed he had met one of the victims (Elizabeth Stride) shortly before her murder.Davenport-Hines, Richard (2004). \\"Jack the Ripper (fl. 1888)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press. Subscription required for online version. Isenschmid and Ludwig were exonerated after another murder was committed while they were in custody.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 86‚Äì88 There was no evidence against Barnardo, Benelius, Puckridge or Sanders.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 88, 80 According to Donald McCormick, other suspects included mountebank L. Forbes Winslow,Cullen, p. 91 whose own suspect in the case was a religious maniac, G. Wentworth Bell Smith.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 109 Most recently, morgue assistant Robert Mann was added to the long list of suspects.Trow, Mei J (2009). Jack the Ripper: Quest for a Killer. Pen & Sword Books. Named suspects who may be entirely fictional include \\"Dr Stanley\\",Promoted by Leonard Matters in his book The Mystery of Jack the Ripper (1929), quoted in Meikle, pp. 74‚Äì75 and Whitehead and Rivett, p. 101 cult leader Nicolai Vasiliev,Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 104‚Äì105 Norwegian sailor \\"Fogelma\\",Whitehead and Rivett, p. 111 and Russian needlewoman Olga Tchkersoff,Promoted by E. T. Woodhall in his book Jack the Ripper: Or When London Walked in Terror (1937), quoted in Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 101‚Äì102 as well as the aforementioned Alexander Pedachenko. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle advanced theories involving a female murderer dubbed \\"Jill the Ripper\\". Supporters of this theory believe that the murderer worked, or at least posed, as a midwife, who could be seen with bloody clothes without attracting suspicion and would be more easily trusted by the victims than a man.Ackroyd, Peter, \\"Introduction\\", in Werner, p. 17 Women proposed as the Ripper include the convicted murderers Mary PearceyEvans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, p. 577 and Constance Kent,Meikle, p. 65 and even Theosophist Helena Blavatsky.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 115 The 19 December 1893 edition of the Ohio Marion Daily Star reported that Lizzie Halliday, a mentally ill Irish immigrant suspected of leaving a string of dead husbands in her wake before being arrested in upper New York State for the murder of two women and her last husband, was likewise accused of the Whitechapel murders, of which she spoke \\"constantly\\". She denied any relation to them, however, and there was no evidence to contradict her claim.Casebook: Jack the Ripper. Retrieved 31 July 2014 Some Ripper authors, such as Patricia Cornwell, believe the killer sent letters to the police and press.Cornwell, Patricia (2002). Portrait of a Killer. G.P. Putnam's Sons. DNA analysis of the gum used on a postage stamp of one of these letters was \\"inconclusive\\" and \\"not forensically reliable\\".Marks, Kathy (18 May 2006). \\"Was Jack the Ripper a Woman?\\" The Independent, retrieved 5 February 2009 The available material has been handled many times and is therefore far too contaminated to provide any meaningful results.Meikle, p. 197; Rumbelow, p. 246 Moreover, most authorities consider the letters hoaxes.See for example, Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 178‚Äì188 Nevertheless, Jeff Mudgett, himself a descendant of notorious American serial killer H. H. Holmes, used these handwriting samples in an attempt to link Holmes to the Ripper case. The H. H. Holmes theory is the basis for an 8-part cable TV series entitled American Ripper, which premiered on the History Channel on 11 July 2017. Author Frank Pearse, who purports to have access to a written confession, argues that the murders were performed by a man named John Pavitt Sawyer (who held multiple similarities, such as residence and profession, to alternate suspect George Chapman), as part of an occult Freemason initiation. Several theorists suggest that \\"Jack the Ripper\\" was actually more than one killer. Stephen Knight argued that the murders were a conspiracy involving multiple miscreants,Knight, Stephen (1976). Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution. whereas others have proposed that each murder was committed by unconnected individuals acting independently of each other (which, if true, would mean there never actually was a single \\"Ripper\\" at all).e.g. Turnbull, Peter (1996). The Killer Who Never Was: A Re-appraisal of the Whitechapel Murders of 1888. The police of the time believed the Ripper was a local Whitechapel resident.Robert Anderson's memoirs, quoted in Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 626‚Äì633 His apparent ability to disappear immediately after the killings suggests an intimate knowledge of the Whitechapel neighbourhood, including its back alleys and hiding places.A \\"Scotland Yard official\\" quoted in the Pall Mall Gazette, 8 April 1892, quoted in Evans and Skinner, The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook, pp. 577‚Äì578 However, the population of Whitechapel was largely transient, impoverished and often used aliases. The lives of many of its residents were little recorded. Despite continued interest in the case and ongoing investigation by both professional and amateur researchers, the Ripper's true identity will almost certainly never be known.

He was one of the founders of the genre of opera, and one of the most influential creators of the new Baroque style. He was also the father of the composer Francesca Caccini and the singer Settimia Caccini. Life Little is known about his early life, but he was born in Italy, the son of the carpenter Michelangelo Caccini; he was the older brother of the Florentine sculptor Giovanni Caccini. In Rome he studied the lute, the viol and the harp, and began to acquire a reputation as a singer. In the 1560s, Francesco de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, was so impressed with his talent that he took the young Caccini to Florence for further study. By 1579, Caccini was singing at the Medici court. He was a tenor, and he was able to accompany himself on the viol or the archlute; he sang at various entertainments, including weddings and affairs of state, and took part in the sumptuous intermedi of the time, the elaborate musical, dramatic, visual spectacles which were one of the precursors of opera. Also during this time he took part in the movement of humanists, writers, musicians and scholars of the ancient world who formed the Florentine Camerata, the group which gathered at the home of Count Giovanni de' Bardi, and which was dedicated to recovering the supposed lost glory of ancient Greek dramatic music. With Caccini's abilities as a singer, instrumentalist, and composer added to the mix of intellects and talents, the Camerata developed the concept of monody--an emotionally affective solo vocal line, accompanied by relatively simple chordal harmony on one or more instruments--which was a revolutionary departure from the polyphonic practice of the late Renaissance. In the last two decades of the 16th century, Caccini continued his activities as a singer, teacher and composer. His influence as a teacher has perhaps been underestimated, since he trained dozens of musicians to sing in the new style, including the castrato Giovanni Gualberto Magli, who sang in the first production of Monteverdi's first opera Orfeo. Caccini made at least one further trip to Rome, in 1592, as the secretary to Count Bardi. According to his own writings, his music and singing met with an enthusiastic response. However, Rome, the home of Palestrina and the Roman School, was musically conservative, and music following Caccini's stylistic lead was relatively rare there until after 1600. Caccini's character seems to have been less than perfectly honorable, as he was frequently motivated by envy and jealousy, not only in his professional life but for personal advancement with the Medici. On one occasion, he informed the Grand Duke Francesco of two lovers in the Medici household--Eleonora, the wife of Pietro de' Medici, who was having an illicit affair with Bernardino Antinori--and his informing led directly to Eleonora's murder by Pietro. His rivalry with both Emilio de' Cavalieri and Jacopo Peri seems to have been intense: he may have been the one who arranged for Cavalieri to be removed from his post as director of festivities for the wedding of Henry IV of France and Maria de' Medici in 1600 (an event which caused Cavalieri to leave Florence in fury), and he also seems to have rushed his own opera Euridice into print before Peri's opera on the same subject could be published, while simultaneously ordering his group of singers to have nothing to do with Peri's production. After 1605, Caccini was less influential, though he continued to take part in composition and performance of sacred polychoral music. He died in Florence, and is buried in the church of St. Annunziata. Music and influence The stile recitativo, as the newly created style of monody was called, proved to be popular not only in Florence, but elsewhere in Italy. Florence and Venice were the two most progressive musical centers in Europe at the end of the 16th century, and the combination of musical innovations from each place resulted in the development of what came to be known as the Baroque style. Caccini's achievement was to create a type of direct musical expression, as easily understood as speech, which later developed into the operatic recitative, and which influenced numerous other stylistic and textural elements in Baroque music. Caccini's most influential work was a collection of monodies and songs for solo voice and basso continuo, published in 1602, called Le nuove musiche. Although it is often considered the first published collection of monodies, it was actually preceded by the first collection by Domenico Melli published in Venice in March 1602 (stile veneto, in which the new year began on 1 March). In fact, the collection was Caccini's attempt, evidently successful, to situate himself as the inventor and codifier of monody and basso continuo. Although the collection was not published until July 1602, Caccini's dedication of the collection to Signor Lorenzo Salviati is dated February 1601, in the stile fiorentino, when the new year began on 25 March. This likely explains why the collection is often dated to 1601. Moreover, he explicitly positions himself as the inventor of the style when describing it in the introduction. He writes: The introduction to this volume is probably the most clearly written description of the performance of monody, what Caccini called affetto cantando (passionate singing), from the time (a detailed discussion of the affetto cantando performance style can be found in Toft, With Passionate Voice, pp. 227‚Äì40). Caccini's preface includes musical examples of ornaments--for example how a specific passage can be ornamented in several different ways, according to the precise emotion that the singer wishes to convey; it also includes effusive praise for the style and amusing disdain for the work of more conservative composers of the period. The introduction is also important in the history of music theory, as it contains the first attempt to describe the figured bass of the basso continuo style of the Seconda pratica. Caccini writes: This passage is often overlooked, because it is brief, and located at the very end of the introduction. It is even indicated by Caccini as a \\"note\\"; an aside or addendum to the main purpose. It is important to observe, however, that the first explanation of this practice is in the context of an essay about vocal expression and intelligibility. Indeed, it was largely the aim of textual intelligibility that led to the development of this musical style, and to the music of the common practice period. Works Caccini wrote music for three operas--Euridice (1600), Il rapimento di Cefalo (1600, excerpts published in the first Nuove musiche), and Euridice (1602), though the first two were collaborations with others (mainly Peri for the first Euridice). In addition he wrote the music for one intermedio (Io che dal ciel cader farei la luna) (1589). No music for multiple voices survives, even though the records from Florence indicate he was involved with polychoral music around 1610. He was predominantly a composer of monody and solo song accompanied by a chordal instrument (he himself played harp), and it is in this capacity that he acquired his immense fame. He published two collections of songs and solo madrigals, both titled Le nuove musiche, in 1602 (new style) and 1614 (the latter as Nuove musiche e nuova maniera di scriverle). Most of the madrigals are through-composed and contain little repetition; some of the songs, however, are strophic. Among the most famous and widely disseminated of these is the madrigal Amarilli, mia bella. Recordings *Euridice.

It is currently, along with other buildings of the adjacent Dunfermline Abbey, under the care of Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument. Origins Dunfermline was a favourite residence of many Scottish monarchs. Documented history of royal residence there begins in the 11th century with Malcolm III who made it his capital. His seat was the nearby Malcolm's Tower, a few hundred yards to the west of the later palace. In the medieval period David II and James I of Scotland were both born at Dunfermline. The gatehouse and pend which link Dunfermline palace and abbey. Dunfermline Palace is attached to the historic Dunfermline Abbey, occupying a site between the abbey and deep gorge to the south. It is connected to the former monastic residential quarters of the abbey via a gatehouse above a pend (or yett), one of Dunfermline's medieval gates. The building therefore occupies what was originally the guest house of the abbey. However, its remains largely reflect the form in which the building was remodelled by James IV around 1500.

Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1593-1595, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 113. Anne of Denmark had a new building built at the Palace completed in 1600, and known as the \\"Queen's House\\", or \\"Queen Anna of Denmark House\\". This tall building had a driveway known as a \\"pend\\" running through its basement level, replacing an earlier gateway.Ebenezer Henderson, The Annals of Dunfermline and Vicinity, from the Earliest Authentic Period to the Present Time, A.D. 1069-1878 (Dunfermline, 1879), pp. 254-5. In November 1601 she prepared a lodging for her daughter Princess Elizabeth, but the princess remained at Linlithgow Palace on the king's orders.John Duncan Mackie, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1597-1603, 13:2 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 895. There was a steep stairwell outside Anne of Denmark's bed chamber, and in March 1602 the English courtier Roger Aston fell down it and was unconscious for three hours.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1597-1603, 13:2 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 960 no. 780. After the Union of Crowns in 1603, the removal of the Scottish court to London meant that the building came to be rarely visited by a monarch. Prince Charles stayed at Dunfermline for a year in the care of Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline after his mother had gone to England. Dr Henry Atkins wrote from Dunfermline in July 1604 to Anna of Denmark, saying the Prince, who was slow to learn to walk, could now walk the length of the \\"great chamber\\" or \\"longest chamber\\" several times daily without a stick.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 16, pp. 163-4. Ten tapestries from the royal tapestry collection were still there in 1616, left from the time the infant Prince Charles resided at the Palace.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 10, p. 521. In 1618 John Taylor, the Water Poet, lodged for a night at the house of the keeper since 1584, John Gibb, which was presumably a part of the palace. Taylor described the site, \\"the Queenes Palace, a delicate and princely mansion, withall I saw the ruins of an ancient and stately built Abbey, with fair gardens, orchards, meadows, belonging to the Palace.\\"John Taylor, 'Pennilesse Pilgrimage', All the Workes of John Taylor, the Water Poet (London, 1630), p. 132. The town was devastated by a fire on 25 May 1624 and Prince Charles sent ¬£500 sterling in aid.HMC Mar & Kellie (London, 1904), p. 122. =Charles I and Charles II= Charles I returned to Scotland in 1633 for his coronation but only made a brief visit to his place of birth. The last monarch to occupy the palace was Charles II who stayed at Dunfermline in 1650 just before the Battle of Pitreavie. Anne Halkett described meeting him there.John Gough Nichols, Autobiography of the Lady Halkett (London, 1875), pp. 59-61. Soon afterwards, during the Cromwellian occupation of Scotland, the building was abandoned and by 1708 it had been unroofed. All that remains of the palace today is the kitchen, its cellars, and the impressive south wall with a commanding prospect over the Firth of Forth to the south.

It is celebrated during the Diwali or Tihar festival and Holi festival. The celebrations of this day are similar to the festival of Raksha Bandhan. On this day, sisters give gifts to their brothers and younger sister also gives gifts to their elder brothers. Brothers also give gifts to their sisters. In the southern part of the country, the day is celebrated as Yama Dwitiya. In the Kayastha community, two Bhai Doojs are celebrated. The more famous one comes on the second day after Diwali. But the lesser-known one is celebrated a day or two after Holi. In Haryana, a ritual also followed, a dry coconut (named gola in regional language) with klewa tied along its width for worshipping is also used at the time of doing aarti of a brother. Regional names The festival is known as: *Bhai Dooj (Hindi: ‡§≠‡§æ‡§à ‡§¶‡•Ç‡§ú) in entire Northern part of India, observed during the Diwali festival. This is also the second day of the Vikrami Samvat New Year, the calendar followed in Northern India (including Kashmir), which starts from the lunar month of KƒÅrtika. It is widely celebrated by Awadhis in Uttar Pradesh, Maithils in Bihar as Bhardutiya and people from various other ethnic groups. The first day of this New Year is observed as Govardhan P≈´ja. *Bhai Tika (Nepali: ‡§≠‡§æ‡§à ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§ï‡§æ) in Nepal, where it is the most important festival after Dashain (Vijaya Dashmi / Dussehra). Observed on the fifth day of Tihar festival, it is widely celebrated by the Khas people. *Bhai Phonta (Bengali: ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶á ‡¶´‡ßã‡¶Å‡¶ü‡¶æ) in Bengal and it takes place every year on the second day after Kali Puja. *Bhau Beej, or Bhav Bij (Marathi: ‡§≠‡§æ‡§ä‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ú) or Bhai Beej amongst the Marathi, Gujaratiand Konkani- speaking communities in the states of Maharashtra, Goa, Gujaratand Karnataka. *Another name for the day is Yamadwitheya or Yamadvitiya, after a legendary meeting between Yama the god of Death and his sister Yamuna (the famous river) on Dwitheya (the second day after new moon). *Other names include Bhatru Dviteeya, or Bhatri Ditya or Bhaghini Hastha Bhojanamu in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. According to a popular legend in Hindu mythology, after slaying the evil demon Narakasura, Lord Krishna visited his sister Subhadra who gave him a warm welcome with sweets and flowers. She also affectionately applied tilaka on Krishna's forehead. Some believe this to be the origin of the festival. The Ceremony tika, made for special occasion of tihar in Nepal On the day of the festival, sisters invite their brothers for a sumptuous meal often including their favourite dishes/sweets. The procedure may be different in Bihar and central India. The whole ceremony signifies the duty of a brother to protect his sister, as well as a sister's blessings for her brother. Carrying forward the ceremony in traditional style, sisters perform aarti for their brother and apply a red tika on the brother's forehead. This tika ceremony on the occasion of Bhai Bij signifies the sister's sincerest prayers for the long and happy life of her brother and treat them with gifts. In return, elder brothers bless their sisters and may treat them also with gifts or cash. As it is customary in Haryana, Maharashtra to celebrate the auspicious occasion of Bhau-beej, women who do not have a brother worship the moon god instead. They apply mehendi on girls as their tradition. The sister whose brother lives far away from her and can not go to her house, sends her sincerest prayers for the long and happy life of her brother through the moon god. She performs aarti for the moon. This is the reason why children of Hindu parents affectionately call the moon Chandamama (Chanda means moon and mama means mother's brother). The celebration Bhai Phonta in West Bengal is celebrated with much splendour. The ceremony is marked with many rituals along with a grand feast arranged for the brothers. It is necessary that, both brother and sister are more than 5 years of age. The festival of Bhai Bij is popular in Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Goa and is celebrated with great fervour and gaiety. Brothers and sisters look forward to the occasion with immense enthusiasm. To add charm to the occasion, Bhai Bij gifts are given to brothers from sisters as a token of love and appreciation. Bhav Bij is a time for family reunions as all brothers and sisters in the family get together. Close relatives and friends are also invited to celebrate the Bhav Bij in many families. Special dishes for the festival include the Maharashtra sweet called basundi poori or kheerni poori. On this occasion sisters give gifts to their brothers. Bhaitika in Nepal 264x264px Tilak of seven colors Bhaitika in Nepal is also known as Bhaitihar meaning Tihar (festival) of brothers. On this day, sisters pray to Yamraj for a long life and prosperity for their brothers. The ritual involves sisters marking the forehead of their brothers with a seven coloured long tika. The rest of the ritual is similar to that performed by Hindus elsewhere. Rabindranath Tagore and the Partition of Bengal Rachel Fell McDermott, Professor of Asian Studies at Columbia University, describes Rabindranath Tagore's rakhi-bandhan ceremonies, inspired by the Bhai Dooj ritual, which were organized to protest the 1905 Partition of Bengal > In 1905 Rabindranath Tagore extended the symbolism of Brother's Second, a > ritual of bonding between brothers and sisters that is celebrated right > after the Pujas have concluded, to evoke friendship between Hindus and > Muslims: members of both communities would tie red threads of brotherhood on > each others' wrists.

He is known for his memoir published in London, England in 1855, Slave Life in Georgia: A Narrative of the Life, Sufferings, and Escape of John Brown, a Fugitive Slave, Now in England. This slave narrative, dictated to a helper who wrote it, recounted his life and later escape from slavery in Georgia. He lived in London from 1850 to the end of his life, marrying an English woman. Life Born in Southampton County, Virginia to slave parents Joe and Nancy (called Nanny), Fed grew up with his twin siblings, Silas and Lucy. They lived on the plantation of Betty Moore, his mother's mistress. He later recalled seeing their father Joe only once, when he was allowed to see the family. His father was held by a planter named Benford in Northampton County. Fed's paternal grandfather had been \\"stolen\\" from Africa, and he was of the Eboe (Igbo) tribe.Brown (1855), Slave Life, pp.1-2 After his father's master moved with Joe from the area, Fed's mother was forced to take another husband. He was known as Lamb and was held by a nearby planter and miller known as Collier. Nancy had three more children with him: Curtis, Iraene, and Cain. Fed and his family all lived in a two-room cabin, with the other room occupied by his mother's niece Annike and her children.Brown (1855), Slave Life, pp.1-2 According to the will of Moore's husband, when the last of their three daughters married, the \\"slave property\\" was to be divided equally among her and the three daughters. There were more than 100 slaves to be divided among the four. Having to leave much family behind, Fed, his mother and brother Curtis were assigned to the lot of the second daughter and her husband, James Davis, and forced to walk to their plantation at Northampton.Brown (1855), Slave Life, pp.7-9 When Fed was about ten, Davis sold him to a slave trader eager for slaves to take to Georgia, which was rapidly developing. He was sold for about $310 and separated forever from his mother.Brown (1855), Slave Life, pp.13-14 In Georgia, Fed was sold to planter Thomas Stevens, a man of Welsh descent in Baldwin County, who had a cotton plantation and whiskey still near Milledgeville.Brown (1855), Slave Life, pp.21-22 He was the maternal grandfather of Mary Ann Harris Gay. She published two works in the late 19th century, a memoir about Atlanta during the Civil War and a novel about antebellum plantation life, set first in Mississippi. Fed worked under Stevens for more than 15 years, and described the man as \\"savage\\" in his treatment. He detailed Stevens cruel treatment and regular physical abuse of him and other slaves over the years.Brown (1855), Slave Life, pp. After Stevens fell sick, he was given to Dr. Thomas Hamilton of Clinton, Georgia. Dr. Hamilton administered cruel experimentation including heat remedies until Brown fell out. After several attempts, Fed escaped, taking the name of John Brown. Brown made his way North, working in various places. He sailed to England in 1850, as the new Fugitive Slave Law passed in the United States increased enforcement against fugitive slaves even in free states. He did not want to be taken back into slavery. In London, Brown worked as a carpenter. There he contacted the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society to tell his story. In 1855 he dictated a memoir to the society's secretary, Louis Alexis Chamerovzow. It was published in London as Slave Life in Georgia: A Narrative of the Life, Sufferings, and Escape of John Brown, a Fugitive Slave, Now in England. Brown's is one of numerous \\"slave narratives\\" published before and after the Civil War. Brown married a local Englishwoman. He remained in London until his death, earning a living as a herbalist. He died in London in 1876. See also *List of slaves Citations Books * Brown, John (1855), and Chamerovzow, Louis (ed.).

The group's work led to a collaboration with the United States Naval Research Laboratory to develop Tor, funded by DARPA. Distributed anonymous storage system The Project's early work focused on an anonymous storage system, Free Haven, which was designed to ensure the privacy and security of both readers and publishers. It contrasts Free Haven to anonymous publishing services to emphasize persistence rather than accessibility. Free Haven is a distributed peer-to-peer system designed to create a \\"servnet\\" consisting \\"servnet nodes\\" which each hold fragments (\\"shares\\") of documents, divided using Rabin's Information dispersal algorithm such that the publisher or file contents cannot be determined by any one piece. The shares are stored on the servnet along with a unique public key. To recover and recreate the file, a client broadcasts the public key to find fragments, which are sent to the client along anonymous routes. For greater security, Free Haven periodically moves the location of shares between nodes. Its function is similar to Freenet but with greater focus on persistence to ensure unpopular files do not disappear. The mechanisms that enable this persistence, however, are also the cause of some problems with inefficiency. A referral- or recommendation-based \\"metatrust\\" reputation system built into the servnet attempts to ensure reciprocity and information value by holding node operators accountable. Although nodes remain pseudonymous, communication is facilitated between operators through anonymous email. Work with Tor Tor was developed to by the US Naval Research Laboratory and the Free Haven Project to secure government communications, with initial funding from the US Office of Naval Research and DARPA. Tor was deployed in 2003, as their third generation of deployed onion routing designs. In 2005, the Electronic Frontier Foundation provided additional funding to the Free Haven Project. In 2006, the Tor Project was incorporated as a non-profit organization.

Biography and career Pszoniak gained international visibility following Andrzej Wajda's 1975 film The Promised Land, in which he played Moritz, one of the three main characters. The actor left Poland during the period of political unrest in 1980‚Äì81, when the Solidarity trade union began and was ended by the imposition of martial law on 13 December 1981. Pszoniak found roles in France, where he was living and working. Since the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, Pszoniak has appeared in Polish movies and plays. Internationally, he simplified his first name into Wojtek, which is the standard diminutive of the relatively formal Wojciech in the Polish language. Pszoniak often played Jewish characters, although he wasn't of Jewish descent. In France, this was partially attributable to his role in The Promised Land, as well as his foreign accent. Pszoniak did not speak French when he emigrated to France, so he learned his theatrical lines phonetically; in movies like Danton, where he played Robespierre, his voice was dubbed. An anecdote about his language skills relates that when he started speaking French, one director told him that he preferred his old accent.

He is best known for being a prominent police figure in the investigation into the Jack the Ripper serial killer murders of 1888. Early life Born in Blandford Forum, Dorset, Frederick Abberline was the youngest son of Edward Abberline, a saddlemaker, sheriff's officer and clerk of the market, minor local government positions; and his wife Hannah (n√©e Chinn). Edward Abberline died in 1849, and his widow opened a small shop and brought up her four children, Emily, Harriett, Edward and Frederick, alone. Police career Frederick Abberline in January 1888. Frederick was a clockmaker until he left home to go to London, where he enlisted in the Metropolitan Police on 5 January 1863, being appointed to N Division (Islington) with the Warrant Number 43519. PC Abberline so impressed his superiors that they promoted him to Sergeant two years later on 19 August 1865. On his promotion he moved to Y Division (Highgate). Throughout 1867 he investigated Fenian activities as a plainclothes officer.The Jack the Ripper A to Z by Paul Begg, Martin Fido and Keith Skinner. Pub. by Headline Book Publishing Plc (1992) pg 5 He was promoted to Inspector on 10 March 1873, and three days later, on 13 March transferred to H Division in Whitechapel. On 8 April 1878 Abberline was appointed Local Inspector in charge of H Division's CID. Frederick Abberline (The Illustrated Police News, November 1888). On 26 February 1887 Abberline transferred to A Division (Whitehall), and then moved to CO Division (Central Office) at Scotland Yard on 19 November 1887, being promoted to Inspector First-Class on 9 February 1888 and to Chief Inspector on 22 December 1890. Following the murder of Mary Ann Nichols on 31 August 1888, Abberline was seconded back to Whitechapel due to his extensive experience in the area. He was placed in charge of the various detectives investigating the Ripper murders. Chief Inspector Walter Dew, then a detective constable in Whitechapel's H Division in 1888, knew Abberline and, while describing him as sounding and looking like a bank manager, also stated that his knowledge of the area made him one of the most important members of the Whitechapel murder investigation team.Dew, Walter 'I Caught Crippen' Blackie & Son Ltd (1938) Among the many suspects in the case, Abberline's primary suspect was Severin Antoniovich Klosowski, aka George Chapman. That theory was reiterated decades later by Robert Milne, MFSSoc, FFS, FA IA-IP, who had recently retired from the Metropolitan Police Directorate of Forensic Services. He presented a paper about the case to the International Association for Identification Conference in 2011 and to the Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences in 2014, suggesting Chapman as the most likely Ripper. Based on his expertise, review of investigation documents, and the use of geographical profiling software, he was convinced that the killer lived in the area of the murders. Chapman fit that bill accurately. Milne also pointed out that Chapman \\"a now known serial poisoner of women\\" ... \\"would go out carrying a small bag, not coming home until 4:30 a.m.\\", according to his estranged wife. In his 2014 paper, Milne also discussed a 1902 murder victim (1901 according to some sources), Mary Ann Austin, who had described a client before her death. According to Milne, \\"a Russian 5ft 7 inches tall with a black moustache [who] visited Mary and in the course of having sex stabbed her and tried to cut out her uterus\\". https://www.csofs.org/write/MediaUploads/Publications/CSEye/CSEye_April_2014.pdf, The 'Jack the Ripper' murders ‚Äì What have we learned?https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2011/09/20/was_a_polish_surgeon_the_real_jack_the_ripper.html, Was a Polish surgeon the real Jack the Ripper?, Toronto Star (Austin died of ten wounds to her abdomen, inflicted at Annie Chapman's former home, Crossingham's Lodging House, at 35, Dorset Street.)

Abberline was subsequently involved in the investigation of the Cleveland Street scandal in 1889. This case left him disenchanted with police work, convinced that there had been cover-ups by his superiors; if so, this was because, during the investigation, some sources claimed that Queen Victoria's grandson had been a frequent visitor to the homosexual brothel on Cleveland Street. That was Abberline's last major case. https://books.google.ca/books?id=ANMTDQAAQBAJ&pg;=PT212&dq;=aberline+cleveland+st+scandal&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjGk5Wf8drjAhXTG80KHQaQC3gQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q;=aberline%20cleveland%20st%20scandal&f;=false, Abberline: The Man Who Hunted Jack the Ripper Chief Inspector Abberline retired from the police on 8 February 1892, having received 84 commendations and awards.Begg, Fido and Skinner, pg5 Personal life Abberline was married twice: once in March 1868 to 25-year-old Martha Mackness, the daughter of a labourer, from Elton, Northamptonshire; she died of tuberculosis two months after the marriage. On 17 December 1876 Abberline married 32-year-old Emma Beament, the daughter of a merchant, from Hoxton New Town, Shoreditch. The marriage lasted until Frederick's death over 50 years later. They had no children. On his retirement from the Metropolitan Police, he returned to Bournemouth and was hired by the Pinkerton Detective Agency in 1904 Initially, he worked in casinos in Monte Carlo to find customers who were cheating. He then returned to England and continued working for the agency, until another retirement in 1904.

A blue plaque commemorating Abberline was unveiled at 195 Holdenhurst Road (now divided into flats) on 29 September 2001. In 2007, following a campaign for Abberline's unmarked grave to be recognised, and with the approval of his surviving relatives, a black granite headstone, inscribed and donated by a local stonemason, was erected on the grave where Abberline and Emma are buried. In film and fiction Detail from a group shot of H Division at Leman Street police station in London c.1886. Authors Wolf VanderlindenRipper Notes #26, July 2006 and Donald RumbelowJack the Ripper: Scotland Yard Investigates, released in October of 2006 tentatively identify this as Abberline. Several fictional retellings of the events surrounding the Jack the Ripper murders have cast Abberline in a lead role. The suggestion is often but erroneously made for the sake of drama that Abberline was unmarried and formed an attachment to one of the women connected to the events. The two most popular film depictions have also cast him as an addict, for which there is no known historical basis. * Abberline was played by Michael Caine in the 1988 television miniseries Jack the Ripper. In this, the character was an aging alcoholic whose quest to solve the murders gives him the strength to give up drinking. * A fictionalized Abberline was featured as the protagonist of Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's graphic novel From Hell (1991‚Äì1999), and was subsequently portrayed by Johnny Depp in the very liberal film adaptation of that work (2001). The graphic novel paints him as a sulky but sympathetic policeman, different from his peers only in his moralism and being overweight, and takes pains to include little-known details of his life such as his involvement with the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. The film's version of Abberline was portrayed as an intelligent young detective who is ahead of his time in his deductive techniques. He is also portrayed as being clairvoyant, allowing the filmmakers to ascribe to Abberline the contributions of spiritualist and psychic Robert James Lees, thus combining the two into one character and simplifying the graphic novel's narrative. Although Abberline is addicted to opium and drinks absinthe, he is a decent man who ultimately goes on a crusade against very powerful governmental and upper-class figures to stop the grotesque murders of Jack the Ripper. In the film, Abberline also has a close relationship with Mary Kelly, and dies shortly after her murder of an overdose in his late 30s; in reality, he died of natural causes aged 86. * Abberline was played by Gordon Christie in the 1973 television miniseries Jack the Ripper. * In \\"The Ripper\\", an episode of the television series The Collector, Abberline was played by Robert Wisden. * Abberline appears as a character in the anime series Black Butler named \\"Fred Abberline\\". While he is still involved in the Jack the Ripper case, this portrayal deviates heavily from the truth, not only by altering his family history (not married but engaged and with a twin brother), but also by placing his death sometime in 1889. However, the manga version of the story (and also the musicals) depicts him like a young enthusiastic and naive Scotland Yard agent who will become the successor of Lord Randall, the actual leader of Scotland Yard. * Abberline, renamed Francis Aberline, appears as a major character in The Wolfman, played by Hugo Weaving. * In the Fantasy Flight Games board game, Letters from Whitechapel (2011), Frederick Abberline features as a playable policeman - in which he has a corresponding portrait (under the name 'Frederich Abberline'). His colour scheme is red. Abberline even gains a unique set of traits in the Dear Boss expansion (2017). * In BBC One's Ripper Street (2012), Abberline is played by Clive Russell. * In the 2015 video game Assassin's Creed Syndicate, set in 1868, a young Abberline is featured as a supporting character, helping the protagonists, Evie and Jacob Frye, capture various Templar criminals throughout London and foil a plot to assassinate Queen Victoria by main antagonist, Crawford Starrick. Additionally, in the DLC named \\"Jack the Ripper\\", set in 1888, Evie Frye helps Abberline solve a set of brutal murders committed by the infamous maniac to find her brother, Jacob. * In the seventh series of the \\"Jago and Litefoot\\" science-fiction audio plays produced by Big Finish, Abberline appears as a character portrayed by Adrian Rawlins. In this story, Abberline is portrayed as having secretly captured 'Jack The Ripper', and recruits the title characters to help him in quietly recapturing the murderer after his escape.

Today it is under the stewardship of Ninian Stuart, who delegates most of his duties to The National Trust for Scotland. History =Early years= Falkland Palace from the gardens Before Falkland Palace was built a hunting lodge existed on the site in the 12th century. This lodge was expanded in the 13th century and became a castle which was owned by the Earls of Fife ‚Äì the famous Clan MacDuff. The castle was built here because the area could be easily defended as it was on a slight hill. The surrounding land eventually became the Palace gardens. There was a great wood of oaks to the north between the royal stable and the River Eden, with many groves merging into the surrounding parkland. Timber was occasionally cut in the forest for royal ships of war. The castle would also have been surrounded by meadows, fields, orchards, glades and Falkland Park which was a managed forest surrounded by a Pale, which is a ditch with a fence on top of it. This pale would have been used to keep game inside the park for the royal family and courtiers to hunt. The land near the palace which is currently the orchard would have originally been meadows. The castle and the palace would have had their own orchard somewhere close by. In 1371 Falkland Castle was destroyed by an invading English army. In 1402 Robert, Duke of Albany imprisoned his nephew and rival David, Duke of Rothesay, the eldest son of King Robert, in the Well Tower at Falkland. The incarcerated Duke eventually died there from neglect and starvation. Albany was exonerated from blame by Parliament, but suspicions of foul play persisted, suspicions which never left Rothesay's younger brother the future King James, and which would eventually lead to the downfall of the Albany Stewarts. =16th century improvements= Between 1501 and 1541 Kings James IV and James V transformed the old castle into a beautiful renaissance royal palace. In May 1501 James IV hired two stonemasons from Dundee to work at the palace, and an hour glass was bought for time-keeping. On 13 December 1501 he was entertained at Falkland by the minstrel Quhissilgibboun, and in September 1504 by fiddlers, lutenists, and an African drummer.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 88, 128, 459. Falkland became a popular retreat with all the Stewart monarchs. They practised falconry there and used the vast surrounding forests for hawking and for hunting deer. Wild boar, imported from France, were kept in the Park, within a fence made by the Laird of Fernie.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (Edinburgh 1907), pp. 461, 472. The teenage James V was kept at Falkland Palace by the Earl of Angus, and according to Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, made his escape to Stirling Castle which was held by his mother Margaret Tudor. His escape plan involved announcing an early morning deer hunt in the park then escaping in the middle of the night dressed as a stable hand.Aeneas Mackay, Historie and Cronicles of Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1899), pp. 324-6 To address the poor state of the garden and park, James V appointed a new Captain and Keeper, William Barclay, Master of Rhynd, in March 1527.Register of the Great Seal: 1513‚Äì1546 (Edinburgh, 1883), no. 558. The Queen's Chamber was hung with tapestry for Margaret Tudor in September 1534.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1531-1538, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 215. James V extended his father's buildings in French renaissance style from 1537 and built a Royal Tennis Court in the garden in 1541.Henry Paton, Accounts of the Masters of Work, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1957), pp. 270, 275, 279-81. The court still survives to this day and is the oldest in Britain. Mary, Queen of Scots became especially fond of the game, and it is said that she scandalised the people of Scotland by wearing men's breeches to play. The arms of the King of Scots at the gatehouse Admidst these building works, the court still came to Falkland and in February 1539 one of Mary of Guise's French courtiers Marie Pieris married Lord Seton by handfasting. The French apothecary was also at Falkland on that day.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 140. James V played cards with Mary of Guise during their visit in April 1540. While they were at the palace the clothes of his infant daughter by Elizabeth Beaton, the Lady Jean Stewart, were washed.Athol Murray, 'Pursemaster's Accounts', Miscellany of the Scottish History Society X (Edinburgh, 1965), pp. 42-3. Robert Murray, the plumber who maintained the fountain at Linlithgow Palace, also provided lead work for a long vanished fountain at Falkland.Henry Paton, Accounts of the Masters of Work, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1957), p. 261. James V died at Falkland Palace in December 1542, from an illness induced by the shock and grief of his army's defeat at Solway Moss and of his wife's failure to give him a male heir, instead giving birth to the future Mary, Queen of Scots. His body lay in the Chapel Royal for almost a month and the Chapel was draped in black. On 4 January 1543 messengers ordered the gentlemen of Fife to convey the king's body to North Queensferry on its way to Holyrood Abbey.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8 (Edinburgh 1908), xxvi, 141-143. Nearby Myres Castle was the home of the Royal Macers and Sergeants at Arms who served Falkland Castle since at least the 16th century. John Scrimgeour of Myres supervised building at the Palace from 1532 to 1563.Exchequer Rolls, HM Register House, last payment in 1563, p. 252. He wrote to Mary of Guise about repairs to Falkland and its lead roofs, delayed by the frosts, and the carts he needed to bring stones to the palace and timber from the harbour at Levenmouth.Annie I. Cameron, Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 442 In May 1559 Scrimgeour repaired the stables and employed Adam Symmers to fix the palace windows, and he designed new ditches and fences for the garden.Henry Paton, Accounts of the Masters of Work, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1957), pp. 297-8. =James VI and Anne of Denmark= James VI of Scotland spent the summer of 1583 at Falkland, and the English diplomat Robert Bowes noted it was a \\"little house\\" unsuitable for holding a parliament.William Boyd, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1581-1583, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1914), pp. 474. In 1584 James VI had the roofs repaired, and requested his tenants in Fife help carry slates, tiles, timber, sand and lime to the palace. He stayed in the palace during the plague in July 1585 and for fear of infection ordered people with no business in Falkland or at court to stay away.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1578-1585, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), pp. 678, 752-3. His guests at Falkland in the summer of 1585 included the English ambassador Edward Wotton and three Danish envoys who came to discuss the Orkney and Shetland islands and the king's marriage.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1578-1585, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), p. 749. Falkland was included in the \\"morning gift\\" that James VI gave to his bride Anne of Denmark. On 12 May 1590 the Danish ambassadors rode from Wemyss Castle to Falkland to evaluate the palace and her Fife lands. They were welcomed by the keeper James Beaton of Creich. The lawyer John Skene produced a charter of the queen's lands and as a traditional symbol of ownership the Danish Admiral Peder Munk was given a handful of earth and stone. After this ceremony, they rode to the Newhouse of Lochleven Castle.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (John Donald: Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 102-3: William Fraser, Memorials of the family of Wemyss of Wemyss, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1888), pp. 28-9. =Raid of Falkland= For five hours in the morning of 28 June 1592 Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, with the Master of Gray, John Hamilton of Airdrie, the Laird of Niddrie and others including men from Cumbria attempted to capture the palace and James VI and Anne of Denmark. They attempted to batter down the back gate but were repulsed by gunshots. The king withdrew to the gatehouse tower and his guard shot at Bothwell's men. According to James Melville the defenders who favoured Bothwell loaded their guns with paper rather than bullets. Bothwell abandoned the attack at 7 o'clock in the morning, and rode away with the king's horses.John Mackenzie, A chronicle of the kings of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1830), p. 145 The English border reiver Richie Graham of Brackenhill and his companions sacked the town of Falkland, taking horses, clothing, and money.Joseph Bain, Calendar of Border Papers: 1560-1594, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1894), p. 516 It was said that Bothwell had given a pep talk to his supporters, encouraging them to kill Sir John Carmichael, Sir George Home, and Roger Aston.Register of the Privy Council, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 761: Historie of James Sext (Edinburgh, 1825): Memoir of James Melville of Halhill (Edinburgh, 1827), pp. 407-8: Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 708-9, 743. =Last years as a royal palace= Another Danish commission including Steen Bille and Niels Krag visited in 1593, which resulted in the keeper James Beaton of Creich giving over more rights over the lands and buildings to the queen.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 135. Anne of Denmark came to stay on 12 July 1594 before the baptism of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle. It was said she left Edinburgh for Falkland because Holyrood Palace was not magnificent enough to receive the Danish ambassadors Steen Bille and Christian Barnekow.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 376-7. Queen Elizabeth sent deer for the park in 1587, and again in 1591 from parks near Colchester.Henry Ellis, Original Letters Illustrative of English History, 2nd series vol. 3 (London, 1827), pp. 121-3: Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 519. When Anne of Denmark visited in September 1598 her bed chamber was hung with tapestry brought from Holyroodhouse. In August 1600 a French acrobat danced on a tightrope in the palace courtyard for the king and the queen.Robert Pitcairn, Autobiography and diary of James Melville (Edinburgh, 1842), p. 487. David Murray became keeper of the garden, park, and Lomond Hills and was allowed to build a house on the site of the old castle, called the Castlestead or Nether Palace of Falkland. Lord Walden stayed for a night in August 1613.Robert Chambers, Domestic Annals of Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1858), p. 451. This house was inherited by the next keeper of the park, John Murray, 1st Earl of Annandale.Alexander Nisbet, A System of Heraldry, vol. 2 (reprint 1984), pp. 204-6: Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, vol. 6, no. 1101: Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1816), p. 665. The palace was occasionally used as a prison. In November 1608 James instructed David Murray to keep James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Balmerino prisoner in the tower of the palace, for treasonable correspondence with the Pope. Balmerino was released in October 1609.HMC Laing Manuscripts in the University of Edinburgh, vol. 1 (London, 1914), p. 112. =Civil war= After the Union of the Crowns in 1603, the architect James Murray repaired the palace for the visit of King James in 1617.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1613-1616, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1891), pp. 517-8. Some courtiers were lodged in the house of Nicol Moncrieff, which still stands in Falkland, opposite the palace gate.HMC Mar & Kellie, vol. 1 (London, 1904), p. 81. Charles I, and Charles II also visited Falkland. Accounts survive for Charles II's stay in July 1650, when proclamations had to be made to reduce the inflated prices of lodgings and horse-hire charged in the village. Charles' food was seasoned with saffron, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. Every tart provided for the king's table had a pound of sugar, while tarts for lesser courtiers required only half a pound.David Stevenson, 'Minute Book of the Board of Green Cloth', Miscellany of the Scottish History Society XV (Woodbridge, 2013), pp. 66-77. A fire partially destroyed the palace during its occupation by Cromwell's troops, and it quickly fell into ruin. =19th Century= Arms of the Marquis of Bute In 1887 John, 3rd Marquis of Bute purchased the estates of Falkland and started a 20-year restoration of the palace using two architects: John Kinross and Robert Weir Schultz. At the time the Palace was a ruin with no windows or doors. Thanks to his restoration work and considerable budget the Palace remains standing today. Many features in and around the Palace show evidence of his work, such as the \\"B\\" on the guttering and portraits of his children carved into a cupboard door in the Keeper's Dressing Room. During the time of Lord Bute, the ornamental kitchen garden was enhanced by a pergola and decorative vases. The north part of the \\"upper garden\\" was redesigned to express the foundations of Falkland Castle and Palace North Range which were uncovered during the Marquis's archaeological excavations. Walls were built atop the foundations for the Well Tower and the Great Hall to emphasise the structures. The Orchard and Palace gardens were linked to the House of Falkland by the private walk and new bridges. Houses were built near the palace and connected into the ornamental kitchen garden and orchard by a system of new public and private paths. The ground around the curling pond (to the North East of the orchard) was planted with trees and shrubs and laid out in flower plots. The enclosing yew hedge around the pond garden is a typical feature of period. The lime tree avenue which is north of the palace gatehouse was built sometime between 1894 and 1912-13 according to the Ordinance Surveys of those periods. The Victorian glass house was built in 1890 by Mckenzie and Moncur from Edinburgh for Lord Bute and was used mainly to grow flowers and exotic plants. Plant hunting was popular at that time and wealthy people would travel the world to find specimens, and plant in their gardens for display to friends. There is also evidence that there was a second glass house in the garden near the existing one. =Modern era= In 1952, the Hereditary Keeper Major Michael Crichton Stewart decided to appoint the National Trust for Scotland to take care of the Palace. The National Trust thus became Deputy Keeper of the Palace, and they now care for and maintain the Palace and its extensive gardens. An NTS virtual tour of the palace is available. =Gardens= Falkland Palace stands on three hectares of ground on a sandstone ridge which is dominated by the Lomond Hills in the background. Those walking around the garden will see a distinct and overlapping timeline which reveals the ever-changing purpose and style of the grounds. The first record of a garden here was in 1451. At that time the garden had a courtyard and stables in the gatehouse, where King James IV kept his great Belgian steed. There was also a fish pond which provided the King with fresh fish. Fruit, vegetables and herbs were grown in the local area for the Royal plate and meat could be hunted in the ancient forest (known as Falkland Forest) surrounding the Palace, by hawking and hunting wild boar and deer. James VI met the English ambassadors Sir Robert Bowes and Sir William Bowes in the garden at 8 o'clock on 21 June 1597 and listened to their speeches about border affairs.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 24. In August 1602 James VI received the French ambassador, the Baron de Tour, in the garden. They talked for three quarters of an hour and the ambassador made the king laugh. A few days later they hunted together in the park.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 1033. Garden designer Percy Cane redesigned the gardens in the 1940s. He had designed the palace grounds at Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Cane was born and educated in Essex where he studied horticulture and architecture. In 1930 Cane founded and edited the quarterly journal Garden Design and wrote many books on garden design. Cane‚Äôs style can best be described as Arts and Crafts and his curvy borders were seen as innovatory at the time. Conservation in the garden is achieved through general maintenance, which includes clearing leaves, mowing the main lawn, tidying the flower beds and planting, enhancing and creating wildlife habitats. A wildflower meadow, native hedges and spring flowering bulbs have been planted to provide food and protection to various small insects and small mammals. Conservation means work has to be carried out in a sympathetic way throughout property, not only to the aesthetics and history of the palace but also for the climbing plants and bats that live in the cellars. Bats are endangered and protected in Scotland and it is important that they are not disturbed. The walls of the palace have been repointed (replacing the cement between the stones) and replaced with lime mortar which is a traditional material and better suited for this purpose as it is breathable and prevents damp. The current Head Gardener Sonia Ferr√°s Ma√±√° is restoring the Percy Cane garden to the original design and flower choice. Ma√±√°, the garden staff and volunteers have been working on various project in recent years to conserve the garden and encourage wildlife. The garden team at Falkland Palace are now encouraging wildlife by bringing back the meadow. To create the meadow the grass has been cut only once a year for the last four years and more than 10,000 wild flowers and a similar number of spring flowering bulbs have been planted. This work is thanks to the garden staff, volunteers and support from Fife Environmental Trust, Scottish Natural Heritage, NTS Member Centres and other donations. These flowers and un-mown grasses encourage beneficial insects to the orchard which aid in the fruit trees pollination and in turn attract other animals. There are currently forty different fly species in the orchard, some of which are rare or unusual and some are found nowhere else in Scotland. The insects, especially the moths, have attracted Pipistrelle and Soprano Pipistrelle bats which have been seen hunting and living here. There have also been sightings of red squirrels in the forest which are now considered endangered animals due to the disappearance of their habitat and the competition from grey squirrels. A Red Squirrel Project is carried out at Falkland Palace to encourage them back into the gardens. A shelter was built in the orchard for invertebrate (i.e. insects and worms) and small animals which will encourage them to stay longer in the garden and perhaps live there. The orchard has been planted with native trees such as hawthorn, oak and willows which would have been growing here in the 15th century. The Maspie Burn running between the garden and the orchard is a habitat for water wildlife, including trout. Description Real tennis court Chapel Royal inside the South Range of Falkland Palace The palace has two wings arranged in an 'L' shape, now called the South and East Quarters or Ranges. The palace courtyard is entered through the gatehouse tower at the west end of the South Quarter. The external ashlar fa√ßade of the South Quarter has gunloops at basement level. Above these are the small windows of the private lodgings, and on the second level the large paired windows of the Chapel Royal. Between these windows are weathered niches and statues. The corbels show the instruments of the passion; the chapel at Falkland was dedicated to St Thomas and is the Catholic parish church for Falkland with Mass every Sunday at 9 a.m.Register of the Privy Seal, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1908), p. 583 no. 4018, 2 Jan. 1529. The wallhead is finished with a decorated cornice and battlement which continues around the west side of the gate tower. To the east of the chapel there is small rectangular sectioned tower which once housed a circular staircase, and beyond is the partly reconstructed gable of the East Quarter. Although some writers have attributed part of the South Quarter to the time of James IV, the form of the gunloops, the continuous parapet, and the documented payments to Peter the Flemishman for the 5 statues in 1539 adequately demonstrate that the present appearance dates from the works of James V.Henry Paton, Accounts of the Master of Works, vol. 1 (HMSO, 1957), p. 256: Dunbar (1991), 6. The entrance tower was built in 1541, and the accounts record the work of two master masons: \\"to John Brownhill and Henry Bawtie for complete ending of the fore entry and tower ... and raising of certain chimneys in the south quarter.\\"Accounts of the Master of Works, vol. 1 (HMSO, 1957), pp. xxxiii, 279. Within the gate tower and south quarter, visitors can view the Keeper's Apartments in the tower, the Chapel Royal and gallery. Falkland Palace, entrance fa√ßade The East Quarter, apart from its courtyard fa√ßade is ruined. The centrally placed access tower, the Crosshouse, was reconstructed by the Marquis of Bute. The National Trust's architect, Schomberg Scott recreated the King and Queen's bedchambers within. The northern section of the East quarter was originally a lodging built by James IV. This part of the building, with its \\"back galleries\\" overlooking the garden was decayed in 1615.Letters Relating to the Ecclesiastical Affairs of Scotland: 1614-1625, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1841), p. 419 In 1616 the master of works, James Murray was ordered to repair the flat roof of the King and Queen's galleries and the roof of the lodging of the East Quarter in anticipation of the visit of James VI.David Masson, David, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1891), p. 518. Comparable fa√ßade at Villers-Cotter√™ts The South and East courtyard fa√ßades were decorated and unified with pilasters in a French Renaissance style between 1537 and 1542. Their appearance is comparable to the French Chateau of Villers-Cotter√™ts. The buttresses on the East are dated 1537, and on the South, where the masonry is more sophisticated, 1539. The later work may be connected with the arrival of Nicolas Roy, a French mason sent to Scotland in March 1539 by Antoinette of Bourbon, the mother of Mary of Guise.Dunbar (1999), 33-36: Dunbar (1991), 4-5: The \\"French master mason\\" started at Falkland on 20 April 1539, Treasurer's Accounts, vol. 7 (1907), 330. The chapel ceiling dates from the time of James V, as recent dendrochronology work has confirmed, and was re-decorated for the visit of Charles I in 1633. James Murray, master of works, was ordered to repair the roof of the South Quarter in 1625, with instructions to \\"have a special care and regard\\" that the great ceiling of the Chapel be \\"preserved and kept as far as possibly may be.\\"David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 13, Edinburgh, pp. 706‚Äì707. The courtyard was originally completed on the north with a great hall to the north. The footprint of the building was established by excavation and laid out with paving slabs by the 3rd Marquis of Bute. Beyond this area are the reconstructed footings of Falkland Castle. This was the site of the short- lived Nether Palace or Castlestead in the 17th-century, known from a plan and elevation drawn by Alexander Edward. Real tennis court On the lower ground in the gardens, slightly beyond the remains of the medieval castle uncovered c. 1900, lies the original real tennis court. The masons William Mason and Alexander Allardice, and others built the tennis court. Its walls were finished by Callum the pargeoner, or lime plasterer.Accounts of the Master of Works, vol. 1 (HMSO, 1957), pp. 278-80. It is the world's oldest tennis court still in use. The roofed spectator area is home to a number of swallows during spring and summer. The court is home to the Falkland Palace Royal Tennis Club.

As of the 2016 census, the village had a population of 853, a nearly two-fold increase (from 439) since the 2006 census. Straffan is the name of the surrounding electoral division which is within the Celbridge Number 1 Rural Area, and which (as of 2006) had a population of 1,449.Census for post 1821 figures. At one time a separate parish, it is today joined to the parishes of Celbridge (in the Roman Catholic structure) and Celbridge and Newcastle (Church of Ireland), in the respective Dublin dioceses. Straffan is home to the Kildare Country Club, commonly known as the K Club, and its two championship golf courses, which have staged major international events such as the European Open (hosted annually there between 1995-2007), and the Ryder Cup tournament between Europe and the USA in 2006. Contemporary village The contemporary village is concentrated around two crossroads on which are situated a Roman Catholic church and Church of Ireland respectively. Development evolved through the building of estate houses (1880), land commission cottages (1922‚Äì39), the Murray local council cottages (1949), and eight estates around the village, Lodge Park (1970), Coarse Moor (1976), The Glebe (1985), Bawnogues (1996), The Beeches (2006), Straffan Gate (2006),Barton Grange (2007) and Straffan Manor (2014). This is set to increase in pace in the coming years when large housing estates are developed on two allotments to the north of the village. Four developments also took place on the grounds of the K Club in the 2000‚Äì04 period, Ryder Cup Village, the Courtyard, Churchfields and Ladycastle. A planning application has been lodged with Kildare County Council (2007) to develop a separate town to the south west at Turnings. Location Straffan is situated at a particularly low lying point in the Liffey valley and is surrounded by flood meadows along the Liffey and River Morell. Agriculture is important to the local economy. Since the 18th century Straffan farmers have been prominent improving agriculturalists and prominent in the prize lists at events run by the Royal Dublin Society. The research station for the Agriculture department of University College Dublin is situated at nearby Lyons Hill. As with the rest of County Kildare, racehorse breeding and training is a prominent local activity. In the 1920s Straffan Station stud was the leading horse breeding stud in the country when owned by Edward \\"Cub\\" Kennedy. Etymology The village is named for St. Sraf√°n, whose feast day in the Martyrology of Tallaght was 23 May. Straffan was also one of 300 Irish locations accorded its own place-legend in Dinnshenchas √ârenn (Metrical (ed. Edward Gwynn 1924) iv, pp328‚Äì331). It consisted of a poem called \\"Lumman Tige Srafain\\", about a warrior named Lumann who possessed a wonderful shield and who, according to the poem, died of his wounds at Tech Sraf√°in. Two forms of the name cited in the tale, Tech Sraf√°in and Tige Sraf√°in, are Middle Irish nominative and genitive case forms. The spelling Straf√°in is unusual. \\"Straphan\\" or \\"Straffan\\" is a shortened Anglicised form of the original Irish Teach Sraf√°in (the initial Str- is the usual development of Irish Sr in English). The second Irish name of the village is Cluain√≠n√≠; this refers to the townland of Clownings, to the east of the village. This was formerly the site of Straffan railway station and the post office, and so it has been erroneously used as an Irish name for Straffan itself. Dinnshenchas √ârenn, probably composed by Cin√°ed Ua Hartac√°in (d. 975), also selected the nearby Cnoch Liamhna for mention as one of the \\"assemblies and noted places in Ireland\\", an indication of the strength of the local ruling family, the U√≠ D√∫nchada branch of the U√≠ D√∫nlainge who supplied ten kings of Leinster from their base on nearby Lyons Hill between 750 and 1050. Sruth√°n (stream) was mistakenly cited by Thomas O'Connor in the Ordnance Survey Letters in 1837, and adopted as the Irish form of Straffan. Seosamh Laoide used it in his list of Irish names of post-offices published in Post-Sheanchas (1905). An Sruth√°n gained currency among those involved in the Irish revival and was promoted as name in the local schools. Recent research by Domhnall mac Giolla Easpaig declares it \\"completely at odds with the written evidence cited above and with local pronunciation and appears to be no more than an ad hoc explanation of the name by O'Connor's informant.\\" Sruth√°n is anglicised struffaun in some parts of the country. One would not expect to find it rendered thus in the Straffan area.\\" The village Post Office, opened c. 1845, was closed in April 1924. A separate office had been opened at Straffan Station in May 1872, this adjacent to the former Station, 1.5 mi (2.5 km) from the village. On the adoption of Irish language names by the Irish Post Office in 1922 the name of Cluain√≠n√≠ was adopted for the Station office, this being the Irish version of Clownings, the townland in which the Post Office and former station were situated. That office was closed c. 1977 at which date the office in the village was reopened and the Irish name of Teach Sraf√°in was adopted, this name appearing in the 1982 Post Office Guide. Places of interest Today Straffan contains Catholic and Church of Ireland churches, a newsagent, a butchers', two pubs, the Straffan Inn and Friel's, a gaelic football club, a soccer club and a primary school, Scoil Bhr√≠de (present building constructed in 1963). The heritage of the area is reflected in the fact that fifty sites of archaeological and cultural interest in the locality have been identified and listed for preservation by Kildare County Council, ranging from an ancient hill fort and round tower to the 1913 Lych Gate to the graveyard which has been adopted as the symbol of the village. Local commercial visitor attractions include a Steam Museum at Lodge Park. =Castles and houses= The nearby tower house of Castledillon passed to the de Hereford and Rochford families (1359) until it too fell into disrepair ‚Äì now only the foundations remain. A Wogan family tower house \\"in the north part of Richardstown townland\\" described as \\"a square building about in height' by Thomas O'Conor in 1837 is now reduced to a pile of stones and mortar which has obviously been moved from its original location. Barberstown Castle (.) was more fortunate. Its battlemented keep is a prominent landmark on the Celbridge to Clane road, at its greatest height with walls four and a half feet thick, two small towers, a 53 step staircase and some evidence of damage in the war of 1641. Originally built by Nicholas Barby in the 13th century, it passed to the Penkistons in the 14th century, Suttons in the 15th century, the Gaynors who built the Elizabethan House in the 16th century, to Katherine Dillon and Lord Kingston in the 17th century, Bartholomew Van Homrigh, in the 18th century and Hugh Barton who built the castle roof and added the Victorian House in the 19th century. It is now a hotel and wedding venue. Lyons Castle mentioned in the 1332 Book of Howth when it was burned by the O'Tooles, passed to the Tyrrell in the 13th century, the Aylmer family in 1271 and to the Lawless family, Barons Cloncurry in 1796 after which they built the nearby house, substantially rebuilt and refurbished by Valentine Lawless, the second Baron Cloncurry 1803‚Äì10... Lodge Park (.) was designed by Nathaniel Clements for Hugh Henry, a Palladian house unusual for its four wings. The story was already current in the early 19th century that when Henry married the daughter of Earl of Milltown he promised her frontage as long as Russborough. The townland known variously in the calendar Rolls as Surning, Twinings, Surnyng and eventually known as Turnings (.) passed into the ownership of Thomas Hall (1406), William Preston (1508), Patrick Sarsfield (ancestor of Patrick Sarsfield of siege of Limerick fame) (1560), Theophilus Jones (1641) and eventually passed to the Mills family. Straffan Lodge (.), described by Samuel Lewis in 1837 as \\"the neat residence of Mrs Whitelaw\\" is noted for its dining room decorated Tudor style with oak panels. Its single storey wing was added later. Religion Local ecclesiastical sites prospered at different times, The medieval parish of Straffan lies on the border of the Diocese of Dublin (boundaries established 1111), to the south of Taghadoe Parish (Teach Tua), bounded on the west by Mainham, south by Bodenstown and Whitechurch, and east by Killadoon and Castledillon. Ecclesiastical sources refer to Straphan Register of the Hospital of St. John the Baptist 1245, the Calendar of Justiciary Rolls 1306 and the Regal Visitation 1530 which describes Straffan as 'a church of the deanery of Saltu Salmonis. In 1541 Straffan was united with Castledillon, Donacumper and Kildrought. Straffan Church of Ireland The last Catholic Parish Priest of Castledillon died in 1707 after which the parish was joined with Straffan. Straffan parish is now joined to Celbridge. Straffan's ruined parish church (St. Patrick's) in the graveyard at the centre of the village can be dated to the 15th century from its distinctive bell cote, and defensive living quarters over the main building in the manner of Oughter Ard and other local churches. The Church of Ireland (1833) has stained glass windows by Alfred Child and Catherine O'Brien and several monuments to the Barton family. It was modelled on churches in France. The Catholic church (1787, rebuilt 1987) was also the site of the national school until 1963. It is part of Straffan's proud ecumenical tradition that the Catholic community used the Church of Ireland while their own church was undergoing reconstruction. A well and stone roofed chapel at Ardrass (restored 1898) are associated with St Patrick. The hill was a place of pilgrimage until the 19th century. Castledillon, situated on the south bank of the River Liffeyopposite Straffan, is an ancient monastic site in its own right founded by Iollathan of the desert (feast day listed as 2 February in the Martyrology of Tallaght) and accorded a genealogy which indicated close kinship with the U√≠ D√∫nlainge kings of Leinster. By 1294 the church of Tristeyldelane was described as \\"not worth the services of chaplains\\" in the Calendar of Christ Church deeds. The site is now identified by a pile of stones and one headstone, erected in 1758 to the Spellissy family. The Castledillon Friars Stone, probably erected for a 15th-century abbot of St Wolstan's (four miles to the east), remained on the site until removed to the Visitor centre in Kildare town. Transport =Straffan rail tragedy= Straffan was the scene of a railway accident on 5 October 1853 in which 18 people died including four children. It occurred in heavy fog when a goods train ran into the back of a stalled passenger train at a point south of Straffan Station. The goods train smashed the first class carriage, which was driven a quarter of a mile through station. The tragedy was the subject of a poem by Donegal-born poet William Allingham. It was the third worst accident in rail history to that date. Straffan railway station was last used for scheduled services in 1947 and the last special train stopped at Straffan in 1963. Straffan railway station opened on 1 August 1848 and finally closed on 10 November 1947. =Straffan Steam Museum= The Straffan Steam Museum is housed in a church which once stood in the Inchicore railway works in Dublin. The museum houses a collection of models of steam locomotives, a number of steam engines used for industrial propulsion, a pumping engine employed in Jameson's distillery in Dublin, and a large beam engine installed in Smithwick's brewery, Kilkenny, in 1847. The museum is open to visitors from on certain days during the summer. History The area was ravaged in the wars of 1641‚Äì2. The Lords of the Pale who allied with Rory O'More in 1642 included Nicholas Wogan of Rathcoffey (member of the Council of War), Andrew Aylmer of Donadea, Nicholas Sutton of Barberstown, John Gaydon of lrishtown (whose estate included the present Straffan), Garret Sutton of Richardstown and James Eustace of Clongowes. In 1641 Lyons Castle was taken and sacked on the orders of the new LJs William Parsons and John Borlase and two castles belonging to Edward Tipper of Tipperstown burned When James Butler, 12th Earl of Ormond marched into Kildare in 1642, he burned Lyons, Newcastle and Oughterard on 1 February 1642. General George Monck landed in Dublin in February 1642 for the parliamentarians and camped in Straffan (the horses field at Ardrass is named as his camp). Rathcoffey was besieged and taken by Monck in June 1642, 70 of the garrison made prisoners and later executed in Dublin. During the campaign Kildare county was burned \\"for in length and 25 in breadth.\\" William Petty's Census of 1659 recorded \\"Barbiestowne\\" with 36 people and Straffan with 23 people, surnames among them included Byrne, Kelly, Doyle, Malone and Murphy. According to depositions taken after the battle of Ovidstown, a party of 1798 Rebels met at Straffan Bridge including Patrick O'Connor 'a lawyer from Straffan', and spent some time in stables of Straffan Lodge (18 June). In 1803 Straffan men marched to Dublin to join Emmet's rebellion, while Barney Daly's pub in Baronrath was used as a rendez-vous. Local landowner Valentine Lawless, later the second Baron Cloncurry, was sworn into United Irishmen by James O'Coigly. He was elected colonel of United Irishmen in Kildare, was the last proprietor of 'The Press' (United Irish newspaper) and became the United Irish organiser in London until his arrest and detention in the Tower of London. He was also related to Robert Emmet and according to Emmet's biographer Ruan O'Donnell provided a link between 1798 and 1803, waiting in Paris for word of success of the rebellion and was to be member of Emmet's government. O'Donnell describes as \\"disingenuous\\" Lawless's 1857 account of how he had pleaded with Emmet not to return to Dublin. The Sammon family form Straffan and the Pitts family from Bishopscourt were listed among the rebels. On 22 January 1812 100 persons assembled at night with carts for the purpose of retrieving hay which had been seized in lieu of rent. Leading to a confrontation during which Patrick King was shot dead. As a result of the incident, a request was made to have the military at Celbridge strengthened. Eventually in 1871 a neo-gothic RIC barracks was built in the village with distinctive gun turrets designed to repel invading Fenians. The barracks was vacated and passed into private hands in March 1905. =War of Independence and the Troubles= A National League branch for Celbridge and Straffan was established on 24 September 1887. Bertram H. Barton was a member of the Unionist Party and instigator of a sedition charge against the Principal of Ardclough School in 1917. Straffan casualties in the Great War included James Cash, (died 27 May 1918), D.A. Carden (4 September 1915), Thomas Goucher (22 January 1918), Ronald B.C. Kennedy (died of illness, 18 August 1917), G Kinahan (14 October 1916), William Lawless (15 September 1917), and Peter McLeish, (21 January 1918). Francis Salmon was a civilian casualty in the Easter Rising of 1916. A branch of the Irish National Volunteers was formed in Straffan in 1914. The St Anne's Brass Band from Ardclough played at the Bodenstown commemoration in 1914 at which Thomas Clarke spoke. In February 1917 a Company was reformed in Straffan and a branch of Sinn F√©in formed in 1918. Volunteers planned to bomb the bridge at Straffan but the plan was aborted. Telephone wires were destroyed at Bishopscourt and Straffan volunteers took part in the ambush at Stacumny on 5 July 1921. Prominent local volunteers included John Logie, Tom Cornelia, James Travers and John McSweeney. During the Civil war the barnewall homestead near the 13th Lock in Lyons was the North Kildare brigade headquarters for the anti-treaty IRA. On 22 June 1975 a local man, Christopher Phelan, was stabbed to death when he delayed an attempt to derail a train passing on the main Dublin to Cork railway line by Loyalist paramilitaries near Baronrath bridge, who aimed to derail a train of republicans going to Bodenstown. His intervention saved the lives of 200 people on the train as it delayed the detonation of the bomb which blew a gap in the track. On 31 March 1976 the biggest train robbery in Irish history took place at Wheatfield. Eight men in fluorescent jackets used emergency signals to stop the mail train bound from Cork to Dublin and escaped with ¬£600,000 in small denomination notes. The incident became the centre of a celebrated miscarriage of justice case, known mistakenly as the Sallins Train Robbery case after the nearest rail station then open, when three men were wrongly convicted of the robbery. =Straffan Estate and its owners= In 1171 Trachstraphli was granted to Maurice Fitzgerald by Richard de Clare (Strongbow). In c1185 -1189 Gerald Fitzgerald was accorded \\"Trachstraphli\\" in the Red Book of the Earls of Kildare (G. MacNiocaill, ed., Dublin, 1964). In 1288 Sir John Fannyn conveyed Straffan and Ballespaddagh (Irishtown) to Richard Le Penkiston on a deed witnessed by Richard de la Salle, John Posswick and Nicholas Barby, each of whom gave their names to surrounding townlands, Sealstown (de la Salle), Possextown (Posswick) and Barberstown (Barby). In 1473 Suttons held the land as tenants and the land passed to John Gaydon (1490), Thomas Boules (1653), Richard Talbot (1679), John White (1691), Robert Delap (1717) and Dublin Banker Hugh Henry who purchased the house for ¬£2,200 in 1731. =Henry family= Joseph Henry of Straffan (Pompeo Batoni, ca. 1750‚Äì1755) Hugh Henry who was MP for Limavady 1713 and Antrim 1727‚Äì43 built a house which resembled Oakley Park in Celbridge. Another Hugh Henry (a nephew) built Lodge Park in 1775. His son Joseph Henry matriculated from Trinity College at 13, inherited the house in 1749, and became MP for Longford 1761‚Äì68, Joseph Henry is featured in many of the caricatures painted by William Hogarth and on display in the National Gallery of Ireland. His son John Joseph Henry gave the site for Straffan Catholic church in 1787. At the request of Valentine Lawless, Henry subscribed ¬£500 for defence of Armagh rebel priest James O'Coigly. In 1801 he married Lady Emily Fitzgerald a daughter of the Duke of Leinster. According to a commentator of the time \\"owing to his extravagance from one of the richest commoners in Ireland he became so embarrassed that he was obliged to sell Straffan and live abroad. Among other foolish things he built an underground passage from Straffan House to the stables.\\" A Benjamin Hallam design for proposed extension to house from 1808 survives, but the house accidentally burned and the Henry family settled in France. =Barton family= Hugh Barton, of the wine firm Barton and Guestier, purchased the Straffan estate and built a new house, Straffan House (1828‚Äì31, designed by Frederick Darley), slightly downriver from the Henry's burned out home. Twenty years later an attic and a distinctive mansard roof were added, and the stacks raised and embellished in the French style. An Italian style campanile tower with gilded vane was added later. The refurbished house was based on a chateau at Louveciennes. Hugh Barton (1766‚Äì1854) was in turn succeeded by Nathaniel Barton (1799‚Äì1867), Hugh Lyndoch Barton (1824‚Äì1899), Bertram Francis Barton (1830‚Äì1904), Bertram Hugh Barton (1858‚Äì1927) and Capt Frederick (Derick) Barton (1900‚Äì1993). The first five generations of Bartons owned both the estate at Straffan and the family's 37-hectare vineyard in St Julien near the Gironde north of Bordeaux, producers of Chateau Leoville-Barton and Chateau Langoa-Barton. On his death Bertram Barton left the Straffan estate to his eldest son Derrick and the Bordeaux estate to his second son Ronald Barton. Anthony Barton moved to St Julien in 1951 and took over the vineyard on the death of Ronald in 1986. The Barton dynasty is believed to be the longest period of single family ownership of any vineyard in Bordeaux. The K Club On the death of Bertram Barton in a hunting accident in 1927 the scale of the losses on the estate, ¬£4,000 per year, became apparent. The staff of 50 outdoor and 16 indoor employees was unsustainable. Derrick Barton laid off most of the staff and demolished part of the house before selling the house and estate for ¬£15,000 to motorcycle manufacturer John Ellis in 1949. Derrick Barton moved to Straffan Glebe House (.) for a time. The last five private owners of Straffan House followed in quick succession: car importer Stephen O'Flaherty (1960), film producer Kevin McClory (1973), Iranian air force founder and minister in the Shah's government Nadar Djhanbani (1977, shortly before the downfall of the Shah's government and his execution), developer Patrick Gallagher (1979) and property magnate Alan Ferguson (1981) who invested ¬£6m in Straffan House but never lived there. Entrepreneur Michael Smurfit, was searching for a suitable estate to develop as a country club, and in 1988 Straffan House was sold for ¬£7m to the Jefferson Smurfit company for use as a golf course and hotel. A further ¬£35m was spent developing the house as a hotel under a scheme negotiated with the government to produce 200 jobs in return for tax breaks for investors. In 1991, Straffan House was opened as a 31-bedroom hotel. Straffan put in its first bid to host the Ryder Cup in 1988, before the course had even been built, for the 1993 event. In 1990, the north course, designed by Arnold Palmer, was completed. Straffan staged the PGA cup in 1991 and Irish professional Championship in 1992. As a result of a ¬£1 million sponsorship offer form Smurfit Kappa, the European Open moved its annual home to Straffan in 1995. In 1999, Straffan's bid for the Ryder Cup was eventually accepted by the European PGA. The tournament was staged in September 2006. The south course was completed in 2003 and used for the European Open of 2004. In 2002, Madison Dearborm took over Smurfit Kappa and divested itself of the K Club. Michael Smurfit purchased the hotel and estate and acquired a further on the opposite side of the river for ‚Ç¨115m in 2004, with the support of property developer Gerry Gannon. To fund this expansion 81 housing units were developed on the course and sold for ‚Ç¨2.5m each. Michael Smurfit purchased Gannon's 49% stake in the K Club for ‚Ç¨40 million in 2012 via the National Asset Management Agency after Gannon's assets had been brought to the attention of the National Asset Management Agency following Gannon's involvement in the Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy. Sport There is a history of horse breeding and training in the area. The Tetrarch, bred by Edward \\"Cub\\" Kennedy and foaled in 1911, never competed as a three-year-old but is still remembered in folklore as one of the best two-year-olds of all time. The 1993 St. Leger Stakes winner Bob's Return was bred at the Baronrath stud at Straffan. Local sportsman Christopher Barton won an Olympic silver medal in 1948 as part of an all-Cambridge eight which represented Britain in the Olympic Games. His father Derrick Barton was a member of the British Modern Pentathlon team which finished seventh in the team event at the 1924 Olympics. Another Straffan resident, David Ritchie, laid out Ireland's first golf course in the Curragh in 1852. There were estate cricket teams in both Straffan and Bishopscourt in 1880. Straffan AFC, a local association football (soccer) club, was founded in 1978 and previously played in Whitechurch in Straffan. In 1979, the club reached the Counties Cup semi-final but were beaten. They decided to move to the Dublin section of the Leinster Junior League in 1981 and the club went on to win its first league title in 1981-1982. Straffan GAA club was described in 1934 as the \\"cradle of the GAA in Kildare Straffan\\". JL Carews played Sallins In their first match on the same day, 15 February 1885, that Maurice Davin's first rules of Gaelic football were being agreed by GAA Central Council in Cork. The club were successful in the 1966 Intermediate championship, and promoted to the Kildare senior championship from 1967 until 1979. In that period, Thomas Walsh played senior football for Kildare having won an All-Ireland Under 21 medal in 1965. In 2009, Straffan won the Junior football championship. Straffan now has two teams competing in the Kildare Senior division 2 and division 4 Football Leagues and at intermediate level in the championship. The annual Liffey Descent canoe race, (first staged 1960) starts annually in Straffan and follows the river Liffey downstream to Islandbridge.

He was born in Pennsylvania. He was left an orphan by age 11 and eventually he made his way to Texas. There he studied law at night and was a cobbler (shoemaker) by day. He was eventually admitted to the bar and took rank as a criminal lawyer alongside his brother-in-law, Pendleton Murrah. He joined the Confederacy and was briefly a member of the famous Hood's Brigade until he became a scout. He served early in the war as a scout for P.G.T. Beauregard, Joseph E. Johnston, and J.E.B. Stuart during Jackson's Valley Campaign in 1862. He rode with J. E. B. Stuart around McClellan's army in 1862. Burke traveled behind Union lines as far as New York, Philadelphia, and Washington. He used disguises, frequently the uniform of a Union officer, and would change the color of his artificial eye. He was able to provide Lee with valuable information about Union forces and dispositions. Unfortunately, Captain John Burke never really kept a record of any field reconnaissance, but the information he gathered for the Confederacy was \\"said to have aided Beauregard and Johnston at Manassas.\\" His most daring adventure came after he was apprehended in Philadelphia. He was placed under guard, in irons and handcuffs. As the train to Washington crossed a high trestle, he jumped into the river and made his way back to Lee. Fatigued by his exertions and now a colonel, Burke resigned and accepted appointment by Governor Murrah as adjutant general of Texas, effective November 1, 1864. General Lee wrote a letter thanking him for his services. Records of the adjutant general's office were lost in the Capitol fire of 1881, and little of Burke's service in that assignment is known. At the end of the war he joined Murrah in his flight to Mexico. After Murrah died, Burke returned to Marshall and resumed his law practice. Before the war, Burke married Jennie Taylor in 1855. They had two sons and a daughter, all of whom were born at John and Jennie Taylor Burke's plantation, Taylor Hall. After the war, Col. Burke emptied his plantation house of all finery as he had to burn it down. During reconstruction, the Yankees seized the plantations of high-ranking officers. Burke knew that being lynched for taking this step was the penalty according to the martial law. No one dared to reproach this dedicated man. His most famous case at the bar was his defense of prisoners held at Jefferson in the Stockade Case in 1869. Burke died at Jefferson on January 18, 1871, and is buried there.  Disguises and Spy Life  John Burke was both a scout and a spy. Those are completely different jobs, yet still similar, especially if one spy is doing them both. Scouting means to hear information, so a scout is one who would hear and find out important information about the enemy and their plans and problems. The way a scout does this is that they are supposed to learn, from others, the movement's, strengths, and force of the enemy. To spy means to see. A spy is supposed to be observative and watch everything. A spy is supposed to learn by seeing. A spy like Burke enters the lines of the enemy in disguise in order to spy out the land. General Thomas Rosser says that John Burke \\"was the eyes and ears of Lee's army.\\" If a spy like John Burke was seen in battle, he is to be seen as 'a regular prisoner of war.' Spies are often secretive by creating clever disguises in order to gather important information. During his expeditions as a scout and a spy, Burke many times went into the enemy's country in various clever disguises. Some of these disguises were being a truck farmer and pretending to be a gentleman of leisure lounging around the capitol at Washington. John Burke also had an artificial eye. He would take out and change the color of this glass eye as a very different disguise. Lastly, because he was born in the Northern region of the United States, Burke \\"possessed a Northern accent that enabled him to move about among the Yankees without rousing suspicion;\\" thus, making him a key element in the Confederate spy ring. As a scout and spy, John Burke invaded the departments and gathered a lot of valuable information from enemies. Importantly for his career, Burke excelled as a mimic. From the most reliable people and sources, he was able to pick up important army news. Although, sometimes John Burke was not careful enough and the enemy was almost too quick for him, but every time, he outsmarted the enemy. On one expedition, John Burke was caught in Philadelphia. He was ironed and handcuffed, and death by hanging seemed to be next. But, while being taken away in a train at night, Burke remembered jumping off of bridges. Because of this memory, he jumped overboard the train and he escaped and was back at Lee's headquarters in only a few days. Back in battle, Burke was discovered again. He decided to abandon and run away from his horse and go into hiding nearby. He found an empty barn. This barn was just too empty. It had no place for Burke to hide. He decided to climb up onto the cross beams overhead, and he hid breathlessly while he watched as his pursuers entered the barn and looked almost everywhere possible that the clever spy, John Burke, could be. Finally, they gave up and left. There are many more escape stories from John Burke's spy and scout career, but there is one particularly amusing one. With the enemy close at his heels, Burke ran into a friend's house nearby. The only possibly sufficient hiding place was the wide-spreading hoopskirt of his hostess. This very personal hiding spot proved sufficient. References Max S. Lale, \\"BURKE, JOHN,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbu33).

A party may raise a Daubert motion, a special motion in limine raised before or during trial, to exclude the presentation of unqualified evidence to the jury. The Daubert trilogy are the three United States Supreme Court cases that articulated the Daubert standard: *Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (1993), which held that Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence did not incorporate the Frye standard as a basis for assessing the admissibility of scientific expert testimony, but that the rule incorporated a flexible reliability standard instead; *General Electric Co. v. Joiner (1997),522 U.S. 136 (1997) which held that a district court judge may exclude expert testimony when there are gaps between the evidence relied on by an expert and that person's conclusion, and that an abuse-of-discretion standard of review is the proper standard for appellate courts to use in reviewing a trial court's decision of whether it should admit expert testimony; *Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael (1999),526 U.S. 137 (1999) which held that the judge's gatekeeping function identified in Daubert applies to all expert testimony, including that which is non- scientific. Important appellate-level opinions that clarify the standard include Judge Kozinski's opinion in Daubert on remand (Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 43 F.3d 1311 (9th Cir. 1995)), and Judge Becker's opinion in In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 717 (3d Cir. 1994). Definition In Daubert, seven members of the Court agreed on the following guidelines for admitting scientific expert testimony: *Judge is gatekeeper: Under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the task of \\"gatekeeping\\", or assuring that scientific expert testimony truly proceeds from \\"scientific knowledge\\", rests on the trial judge. *Relevance and reliability: This requires the trial judge to ensure that the expert's testimony is \\"relevant to the task at hand\\" and that it rests \\"on a reliable foundation\\". Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 584-587. Concerns about expert testimony cannot be simply referred to the jury as a question of weight. Furthermore, the admissibility of expert testimony is governed by Rule 104(a), not Rule 104(b); thus, the Judge must find it more likely than not that the expert's methods are reliable and reliably applied to the facts at hand. *'Scientific knowledge = scientific method/methodology: A conclusion will qualify as scientific knowledge if the proponent can demonstrate that it is the product of sound \\"scientific methodology\\" derived from the scientific method.Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (1993) 509 U.S. 579, 589. *Illustrative factors: The Court defined \\"scientific methodology\\" as the process of formulating hypotheses and then conducting experiments to prove or falsify the hypothesis, and provided a set of illustrative factors (i.e., not a \\"test\\") in determining whether these criteria are met: # Whether the theory or technique employed by the expert is generally accepted in the scientific community; # Whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication; # Whether it can be and has been tested; # Whether the known or potential rate of error is acceptable; and # Whether the research was conducted independent of the particular litigation or dependent on an intention to provide the proposed testimony.Daubert v. Merrel Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 43 F.3d 1311 (9th Cir. 1995) In 2000, Rule 702 was amended in an attempt to codify and structure elements embodied in the \\"Daubert trilogy.\\" The amended rule then read as follows: (As amended Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec. 1, 2000.) In 2011, Rule 702 was again amended to make the language more clear. The rule now reads: (As amended Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec. 1, 2000; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011) While some federal courts still rely on pre-2000 opinions in determining the scope of Daubert, as a technical legal matter, any earlier judicial rulings that conflict with the language of amended Rule 702 are no longer good precedent. Use Although the Daubert standard is now the law in federal court and over half of the states, the Frye standard remains the law in some jurisdictions including California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Washington.Giannelli & E. Imwinkelried, Scientific Evidence ¬ß¬ß 1.06, 1.16 (4th ed. 2007). Florida passed a bill to adopt the Daubert standard as the law governing expert witness testimony, which took effect on July 1, 2013.Reuters On May 23, 2019, the Florida Supreme Court accepted the Daubert standard.https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2019/05/23/daubert-evidence- standard-takes-immediate-effect-in-florida-after-high-court- turnaround/https://www.natlawreview.com/article/daubert-standard-once-again- controls-florida-state-court The National Law Review On August 28, 2020, The Maryland Court of Appeals adopted the Daubert standard.https://www.mdcourts.gov/data/opinions/coa/2020/47a19.pdf Although trial judges have always had the authority to exclude inappropriate testimony, prior to Daubert, trial courts often preferred to let juries hear evidence proffered by both sides. Once certain evidence has been excluded by a Daubert motion because it fails to meet the relevancy and reliability standard, it will likely be challenged when introduced again in another trial. Even though a Daubert motion is not binding to other courts of law, if something was found untrustworthy by one court, other judges may choose to follow that precedent. Of course, a decision by an appellate court that a piece of evidence is inadmissible under Daubert would be binding on district courts within that court's jurisdiction. =Daubert motion: timing= To attack expert testimony as inadmissible, counsel may bring pretrial motions, including motions in limine.The third circuit has emphasized the importance of conducting in limine hearings under Fed. R. Evid. 104 (resolution of preliminary questions) when making reliability determinations required by Fed. R. Evid. 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). See Padillas v. Stork-Gamco, Inc., 186 F.3d 412, 417 (3d Cir. 1999) ; Voilas v. General Motors Corp., 73 F.

The motion in limine may be brought prior to trial, although counsel may bring the motion during trial as well.See, e.g., Smoot v.

Supp. 2d 733, 737 (D.N.J. 1999). A motion attacking expert testimony should be brought within a reasonable time after the close of discovery if the grounds for the objection can be reasonably anticipated.See, e.g., Pineda v. Ford Motor Co., 520 F.3d 237, 241-242 (3d Cir. 2008) (after deposition of plaintiff's expert, defendant filed alternative motions to exclude testimony of plaintiff's expert and for summary judgment, and motion for Daubert hearing). The hearing should be made well in advance of the first time a case appears on a trial calendar. In one case where a Daubert hearing was conducted on the day of the trial, in which the district court excluded all plaintiff's expert testimony, resulting in the dismissal of all claims, the appellate court remanded the case because of multiple irregularities and a defective record of lower court proceedings.Webster v. Fulton County, Ga., 85 F. Supp. 2d 1375, 1377 (N.D. Ga. 2000) (denying defendant's Daubert motion as untimely, when brought after court had relied on plaintiff expert's report in denying defense summary judgment motion, and within days of trial date). See also Alfred v. Caterpillar, Inc., 262 F.3d 1083, 1087 (10th Cir. 2001 ) (counsel should not sandbag Daubert concerns until close of opponent's case; however, appellate court did not reach issue of late filing of motion because district court chose to address defendant's Daubert objections on merits, rather than deeming them waived); Pullman v. Land O'Lakes, Inc., 262 F.3d 759, 763 (8th Cir. 2001) (appellate court noted with disapproval that defendant failed to bring Daubert motion until shortly before the trial began; Daubert inapplicable to experimental test evidence not presented by expert witnesses). The appellate court noted that in cases that rely heavily on expert testimony, a district court should set a discoverySee Smith v. Ford Motor Co., 215 F.3d 713, 722 (7th Cir. 2000) . See also Goebel v. Denver and Rio Grande W. R.R., 215 F.3d 1083, 1087 (10th Cir. 2000) (district court orally denied motion to exclude expert testimony on morning of trial); McPike v. Corghi S.p.A., 87 F. Supp. 2d 890, 891 n.1 (E.D. Ark. 1999) (court telephoned attorneys with ruling denying defendant's motion to exclude plaintiff's expert testimony, because closeness of trial did not allow time for formal written memo and order at that time; court later rendered substituted memorandum and order, fully stating reasons for its decision in writing). and trial schedule that realistically provides both sides with an adequate opportunity to introduce necessary evidence. The application of Federal Rule of Evidence 702 to proposed expert testimony can often be an uncertain process, and is best conducted in such a manner that litigants have a reasonable opportunity to locate experts who meet the rule's requirements. In another case in which the defendant was apparently at fault for filing a motion to exclude expert testimony one week before the trial date, the district court denied the motion on that ground, but it advised the defendant that it might conduct its own voir dire of the expert in question before he testified. The district court preliminarily found that defendant's motion was predicated on a ruling made almost three months earlier by a district court in another state, and that defendant had shown no good cause for waiting to file the motion. The defendant ultimately lost that case, following the admission of the disputed expert testimony, and ultimately failed in its appeal.See Clay v. Ford Motor Co., 215 F.3d 663, 674 (6th Cir. 2000) An evidentiary hearing on the motion may not be necessary if the court finds that it would not assist the court in ruling on any of the matters in the motion. History Prior to Daubert, relevancy in combination with the Frye test were the dominant standards for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence in Federal courts. Frye is based on a 1923 Federal Court of appeals ruling involving the admissibility of polygraph evidence.Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (DC Cir. 1923) Under Frye, the Court based the admissibility of testimony regarding novel scientific evidence on whether it has \\"gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.\\" The trial court's gatekeeper role in this respect is typically described as conservative, thus helping to keep pseudoscience out of the courtroom by deferring to those in the field. In Daubert, the Supreme Court ruled that the 1923 Frye test was superseded by the 1975 Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 702 governing expert testimony. Rule 702 originally stated (in its entirety), > If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the > trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue, a > witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or > education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise. In Daubert, the Court ruled that nothing in the Federal Rules of Evidence governing expert evidence \\"gives any indication that 'general acceptance' is a necessary precondition to the admissibility of scientific evidence. Moreover, such a rigid standard would be at odds with the Rules' liberal thrust and their general approach of relaxing the traditional barriers to 'opinion' testimony.\\" By requiring experts to provide relevant opinions grounded in reliable methodology, proponents of Daubert were satisfied that these standards would result in a fair and rational resolution of the scientific and technological issues which lie at the heart of product liability adjudication. Daubert has not appeared to further the Federal Rules philosophy of admitting generally all relevant testimony, and specifically of relaxing the traditional barriers to 'opinion' testimony.\\" The Daubert decision has instead been heralded by some political commentators as one of the most important Supreme Court decisions in imposing higher barriers for toxic tort and product liability cases, by allegedly reducing the volume of so-called junk science in the court room. According to a 2002 RAND study, post Daubert, the percentage of expert testimony by scientists that was excluded from the courtroom significantly rose. This rise likely contributed to a doubling in successful motions for summary judgment in which 90% were against plaintiffs.Dixon, Lloyd and Brian Gill, Changes in the Standards for Admitting Expert Evidence in Federal Civil Cases Since the Daubert Decision. Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2001. https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1439.html. Beyond this study, there is little empirical evidence of the impact of Daubert. However, some critics argue that Daubert has disrupted the balance between plaintiffs and defendants, \\"The exclusion of expert testimony affects plaintiffs far more than defendants because plaintiffs may then not be able to meet their required burden of proof. Furthermore, there is little point in plaintiffs going to the expense of Daubert motions to exclude defendant's experts until they know if their case will proceed. So if more experts are now being excluded, then Daubert has undoubtedly shifted the balance between plaintiffs and defendants and made it more difficult for plaintiffs to litigate successfully.\\" Similarly, Daubert hearings can be subject to various abuses by attorneys attempting to bolster a weak case. These tactics can range from simply attempting to delay the case to driving up the costs of the litigation forcing settlement. A different pattern has emerged in criminal cases. In criminal cases, the prosecution has the burden of proof and uses a host of forensic science methods as evidence to prove their case; but Daubert motions are rarely made by criminal defendants and when they do, they lose a majority of the challenges. Some critics of the use of unreliable science in court argue that Daubert has had beneficial effects in civil litigation, but fails to address the underlying pathologies of the forensic science system that leads to dubious verdicts in criminal cases. Some commentators believe that Daubert caused judges to become‚Äîin the phrase used in former Chief Justice William Rehnquist's dissent in Daubert‚Äîamateur scientists, many lacking the scientific literacy to effectively fulfill their role as gatekeeper of scientific evidence. Although \\"science for judges\\" forums have emerged in the wake of Daubert in order to educate judges in a variety of scientific fields, many are still skeptical about the usefulness of the Daubert standard in discerning valid science. The responsibility to assess scientific relevance has shifted from highly trained expert witnesses to judges deficient in science education. The \\"Daubert\\" ruling furthermore admits the possible introduction of non-peer reviewed data and conclusions. This increasingly shifts the burden of scientific judgement onto judges who have not had an education which would enable them to properly evaluate such data. Pursuant to Rule 104(a), in Daubert the U.S. Supreme Court suggested that the following factors be considered:See (c) of the syllabus of the Daubert case. # Has the technique been tested in actual field conditions (and not just in a laboratory)? # Has the technique been subject to peer review and publication? # What is the known or potential rate of error? # Do standards exist for the control of the technique's operation? # Has the technique been generally accepted within the relevant scientific community? The Supreme Court explicitly cautioned that the Daubert list should not be regarded by judges as \\"a definitive checklist or test...\\" Yet in practice, judges have judged the admissibility of scientific evidence using the \\"Daubert factors\\" as a checklist; for example, the trial court judge in Kumho admitted to erroneously treating the factors as mandatory. International influence The Canadian Supreme Court has expressly adopted the Daubert standard in two cases. R. v. Mohan,;[1994] 2 S.C.R. 9 R. v. J.L.-J., [2000].2 S.C.R. 600 In J.L.-J., the Court took a look at the development of U.S. law in this regard, noted the U.S. Supreme Court's rejection of the Frye standard and its replacement with the Daubert Standard. While the Court did note that: \\" Daubert must be read in light of the specific text of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which differs from our own procedures,\\" the Court also stated in the same sentence that \\"the U.S. Supreme Court did list a number of factors that could be helpful in evaluating the soundness of novel science.\\"Id. The Court then applied the Daubert standard to a decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal. The Quebec Court had held that greater liberality should be applied by the Court in receiving pro-defense scientific evidence in a criminal case.[1998] R.J.Q. 2229, 130 C.C.C. (3d) 541, [1998] Q.J. No. 2493 (QL). The Court rejected this decision and reinstated the defendant's conviction. Additionally, in 2005, the United Kingdom House of Commons Science and Technology Committee recommended the creation of a Forensic Science Advisory Council to regulate forensic evidence in the UK and observed that: > The absence of an agreed protocol for the validation of scientific > techniques prior to their being admitted in court is entirely > unsatisfactory. Judges are not well-placed to determine scientific validity > without input from scientists. We recommend that one of the first tasks of > the Forensic Science Advisory Council be to develop a \\"gate-keeping\\" test > for expert evidence. This should be done in partnership with judges, > scientists and other key players in the criminal justice system, and should > build on the US Daubert test.House of Commons Science and Technology > Committee (2005) Forensic Science on Trial, London: The Stationery Office > Limited, HC96-I, para.173 The Law Commission for England and Wales has proposed a consultation paper (No.190) to adopt a criterion like the Daubert Standard to help reform the law of evidence in regards to the admissibility of scientific evidence.The Admissiblity of Expert Evidence in Criminal Proceedings in England and Wales (PDF) See also * Frye standard * Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine * Objective historian References External links * The Daubert Trilogy in the States * Daubert on the Web * Daubert-The Most Influential Supreme Court Decision You've Never Heard Of * Project on Scientific Knowledge and Public Policy (SKAPP), collection of original documents and commentary on the Daubert standard and the use of science in public policy. * Barry Yeoman Putting Science in the Dock, The Nation * *Eric Helland, \\"The Role of Ideology in Judicial Evaluations of Experts,\\" The Journal of Law and Economics 62, no. 4 (November 2019): 579-611. * The Daubert Tracker Category:Science and law Category:United States evidence law ","title":"Daubert standard"},{"id":"1141966","text":"Cadets marching at the Depot RCMP Academy, Depot Division (commonly known as \\"Depot\\", not ) has been providing police training to Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) \\"cadets\\" since its establishment in 1885. The facility is located in the west part of Regina, Saskatchewan, near the airport, and consists of several buildings. History Cadets wear the iconic red serge of the force at graduation In the RCMP's early days, Depot had a full horse stable and employed veterinarians. Horsemanship is no longer part of the cadets' training since 1966. Depot is the only location where the RCMP trains its cadets. One of the only rare exceptions was some Mounties were trained at an Ottawa region facility in the 1950s or 1960s. This training centre, now closed, was located by the present Ottawa RCMP stables, where the horses of the RCMP Musical Ride are kept off-season. The buildings of the former Ottawa training centre have become the Canadian Police College, a Canadian government institution which offers continuing-education courses for currently employed police officers. A small number of members had part of their training at CFB Penhold in Alberta as well in the early 70s. At that time, due to extensive hiring and construction at the academy, Depot could not handle the overwhelming number of candidates. Therefore, the RCMP established the additional and temporary training facility in CFB Penhold, near Red Deer, AB. In addition to training new RCMP regular members, Depot has also been a major continuing-education centre for police in Canada, but is currently tasked primarily with the training of new members and other training is conducted elsewhere. It delivers updated and highly specialized training to experienced RCMP officers and to members of other forces from around the world who want to improve their knowledge. Many Canadian municipal and provincial police forces hire police officers who graduated from the RCMP Academy. No one can join the RCMP as a regular member without completing the RCMP Academy's 26-week Cadet Training Program. Candidates who are graduates of a police training institution and have served a minimum of two years in a policing role with another Canadian police agency can undergo a five-week learning and orientation program rather than the full 26-week program.http://www.rcmp- grc.gc.ca/en/experienced-police-officers The RCMP Academy has altered its curriculum due to the social and economic changes of Canadian society; the school now focuses more on knowledge relating to the multiple facets of law enforcement than on military discipline. In the early 1990s, the six-month thorough military-style RCMP training was slightly modified to face the new make-up of trainees. Cadets are now 10 years older than their 1950s or 1960s counterparts; and decade after decade, the ratio of college and university- educated future Mounties keeps increasing. The higher maturity level of trainees requires fewer disciplinary actions and enables the instructors to focus on the very demanding requirements of modern police work. As of February 5th 2020, cadets at the RCMP Academy receive a weekly allowance of $525 to a maximum of $13,650 for the entire 26-week Cadet Training Program. After the recruitment process, successful candidates are scheduled to attend the Academy and begin the Cadet Training Program. Cadets are grouped together in what the force calls \\"troops\\". A troop consists of a maximum of 32 men and women who follow their entire 26-week training together. The number of trainees at Depot varies in relation to the demands of the force. Buildings at Depot =Chapel= RCMP Chapel The oldest remaining building in Regina is the RCMP chapel, dating from the earliest establishment of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) as a guardhouse in 1883. It subsequently served as a mess hall and canteen and became a chapel in 1895. It was constructed in Ontario and moved by flatcar, steamer and ox team to Regina. The chapel was built by Mr. John Ross, a local building contractor. Originally a mess hall it was partially destroyed by fire in the spring of 1895. After its restoration it was converted to a chapel. The wife of the police commissioner, Mrs. Herchmer, wanted a chapel for the force members, who were located west of town. NWMP carpenters converted the mess hall to a chapel, making the altar and pews themselves. The chapel was dedicated on December 8, 1895. The Institute for Stained Glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at the RCMP Museum Chapel.Stained glass at the RCMP Museum Chapel http://stainedglasscanada.ca/site.php?site=81 On each side of the altar is a stained glass memorial window, each portrays a member of the force. On the left is a constable in mourning; on the right is a bugler sounding reveille. The model for the windows was Constable John Roy Fraser of Westville, Nova Scotia, in 1943. Fraser retired in 1960 at the rank of staff sergeant. The Memorial Project came about following the shooting of Constable Willis Edward Rhodeniser on the White Bear Reserve near Carlyle, Saskatchewan, on August 26, 1939. Two more stained glass memorial windows on each side wall near the front were dedicated on November 4, 1951. The Resurrection in the west window honours serving members and The Nativity in the east window honours ex-members of the force who died in the Second World War. The chapel is one of the oldest Anglican houses of worship in western Canada, but today has only two monthly religious services. There is an Ecumenical (Protestant) service on the second Sunday of each month and a Roman Catholic service on the fourth Sunday of each month at 11 am. =Centennial Building= Formerly the RCMP Centennial Museum. Established in 1933, the RCMP Museum operated in a number of facilities for its first sixty years. The museum was officially opened on its present site in 1973 by Her Majesty Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, in honour of the RCMP's centennial. The museum contained many artifacts relating to the colourful history and traditions of the RCMP. The museum permanently closed in October 2006 and the collection moved to the RCMP Heritage Centre. The building now houses an auditorium, simulator training classroom and mess hall. =The Headquarters Building= The Headquarters Building, formerly named A Block and now named for Commissioner A. B. Perry, was built in 1913 and is located on the original site of the headquarters of the NWMP. =Applied Police Sciences Building= The APS Building contains classrooms, 100-seat theatre, specialized computer classrooms and various syndicate rooms. =Learning Resource Centre= This building has an extensive collection of law enforcement reference materials, an in-house automated catalogue, on-line connection to the University of Regina and the Regina Public Library collections, as well as several Internet workstations. =Old Gym= The gym, commonly referred to as the \\"Old Gym\\", is equipped with a self-defence gymnasium and a 26-metre swimming pool. Fitness Centre Fitness Centre Commonly referred to as the \\"New Gym\\", the Fitness Centre includes a large gymnasium and a state-of-the-art cardio and weight training facility complete with treadmills, steppers, stationary bikes, free weights and various types of weight training equipment. This facility was expanded in 2007. =The Model Detachment= Opened in 1994, the Buffalo Detachment, is a replica of a modern working RCMP Detachment, complete with everything you would find in such a facility. It provides the main hub of training at the Academy. A second detachment, known as \\"Eagle detachment\\" has since been implemented to accommodate larger troop loads. =The Town Site= Surrounding the Model Detachment, this provides for a more realistic and safe environment during practical simulation scenarios. =Centralized Training Facility= This building offers serving members and outside agencies both modern classrooms and accommodations. =Learning Technology Centre= Equipped with a full video conferencing suite for distance learning or corporate communication, this building also contains creative service bureaus, that include video and photo studios, multimedia and graphics units as well as a print shop. =RCMP Heritage Centre= RCMP Heritage Centre in Regina, Saskatchewan designed by Canadian architect Arthur Erickson Opened in May 2007, the RCMP Heritage Centre is a non-profit, volunteer governed, charitable organization incorporated under the Non-Profit Corporations Act of Saskatchewan.. =The Firearms Complex= The complex includes 2 - 25 metre indoor ranges and a 100-metre indoor range, all of which have 16 positions. There are a number of modern classrooms, as well as firearm training simulators. =Armourer's Shop= This building provides for the inspection and preparation of new firearms for issue; complete repair, reconditioning and maintenance of firearms; training on firearms maintenance and repair, quality assurance of ammunition; consultation services in the field of small arms and ammunition; testing of bullet-proof vests and material and warranty services for many firearms manufacturers. =The Police Driving Unit= Spread around Depot, it includes a large modern vehicle fleet as well as six 4x4 vehicles. There are a number of tracks that simulate various driving conditions. =Drill Hall= Drill Hall Built in 1929 as a Riding School, it now provides for the teaching of foot drill and crowd control. It is also used for many social functions including Troop Graduations and Regimental Balls. =Medical Treatment Centre= The centre contains a health clinic, infirmary with several beds, treatment and therapy rooms. It has a full-time staff of medical personnel, including a Medical Doctor, Nurse, Psychologist and Physiotherapist.

Timed to coincide with a UNICEF development conference in New York City, Sport Aid raised $37 million for Live Aid and UNICEF. A second, lower-key Sport Aid was held in 1988. Organisation The event was organised by chairman and founder Chris Long, Bob Geldof (Band Aid and Live Aid) and John Anderson (Head of Global Special Events, UNICEF). A central event was the lighting of a symbolic torch at the United Nations by Omar Khalifa, a champion Sudanese 1500m runner, to signal the start of the 10K races around the world. Khalifa began his journey to the UN on May 16, when he lit a torch from the embers of a fire in El Moweilih relief camp in the Sudan. He was then flown to Athens, where the torch of Africa and the Olympic torch were symbolically joined. This marked the first time the Olympic torch had been lit outside of an Olympic Games. Khalifa then ran through 12 European capitals, and was greeted by leaders such as Margaret Thatcher, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Fran√ßois Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl and Pope John Paul II. The events in the United States were not widely publicized, due in part to the Hands Across America fundraiser, to fight hunger and homelessness, occurring around the same time. Sport Aid was scheduled to take place on the eve of a UN special session on Africa; therefore, the conflict could not be avoided. Race Against Time At 15:00 UTC on Sunday, May 25, 1986, runners around the world ran, jogged or walked 10 kilometers, having collected sponsorships or donations to support African famine relief charities. 274 cities held official events, allowing over 19.8 million participants to follow designated courses, with television coverage worldwide. London saw 200,000 runners complete the course, Barcelona hosted 50,000, Athens 30,000, Santiago 15,000, Dublin 20,000, Port of Spain 15,000, and Melbourne 10,000. These runners and millions of others set out at the same time to run around their villages or local parks, or simply to take part in this global event. In the United States, New York City, Chicago, Atlanta and San Francisco participated, along with several running clubs in smaller towns, with New York hosting the flagship race. The New York Times reported, \\"With 200,000 Londoners setting the pace, more than 20 million runners in 76 countries ran today in Sport Aid, a global benefit to raise money for the starving of Africa.\\" Today, Sport Aid is still the biggest sporting event ever organized. Other events Other events included the Ultimate Cricket Match between the West Indies and the Rest of the World, and a figure skating exhibition featuring Torvill and Dean. A charity record was released to publicize and raise money for the event. Tears for Fears rerecorded their hit \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" as \\"Everybody Wants to Run the World\\". 1988 In support of the 1988 Sport Aid event, the band Status Quo released the charity single \\"Running All Over the World\\", an adaptation of \\"Rockin' All Over the World\\". Also released was the video game tie-in The Race Against Time; the game is considered to have been a commercial failure.

Known as Bellcore after its establishment in the United States in 1983 as part of the break-up of the Bell System, the company's name changed to Telcordia Technologies after a change of ownership in 1996. The business was acquired by Ericsson in 2012, then restructured and rebranded as iconectiv in 2013. A major architect of the United States telecommunications system, the company pioneered many services, including caller ID, call waiting, mobile number portability and toll-free telephone number (800) service. It also pioneered the prepaid charging system and the Intelligent Network. Headquartered in Bridgewater, New Jersey (U.S.), iconectiv provides network and operations management, numbering, registry and fraud prevention services for the global telecommunications industry. It provides numbering services in more than a dozen countries, including serving as the Local Number Portability Administrator (LNPA) for the United States. In that capacity, iconectiv manages the Number Portability Administration Center (NPAC), the system that supports the implementation of local number portability. Founding iconectiv was established on October 20, 1983, as Central Services OrganizationRestated Articles of incorporation of Bell Communications Research, Inc. as part of the 1982 Modification of Final Judgment that broke up the Bell System. It later received the name Bell Communications Research. Nicknamed Bellcore, it was a consortium established by the Regional Holding Companies upon their separation from AT&T.; Since AT&T; retained Bell Laboratories, the operating companies desired a separate research and development facility. Bellcore, the tenth company to register an Internet domain name in comTLD, provided joint research and development, was involved in standards setting, training, and centralized government point-of- contact functions for its co-owners, the seven Regional Holding Companies that were themselves divested from AT&T; as holding companies for the 22 local Bell Operating Companies. Bellcore's initial staff and corporate culture were drawn from the nearby Bell Laboratories locations in northern New Jersey, plus additional staff from AT&T; and regional operating companies. The company originally had its headquarters in Livingston with dedication by New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean in 1985, but moved its headquarters to Morristown a decade later. Bellcore also operated the former Bell System Center for Technical Education in Lisle, Illinois. Separation from the Baby Bells In 1996, the company was provisionally acquired by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The sale was closed one year later, following a regulatory approval process that covered all the states individually. Since the divested company no longer had any ownership connection with the Bell regional companies, the name was changed to Telcordia Technologies. in 1999.State of Delaware, Office of the Secretary of State, March 17, 1999 The headquarters was moved to Piscataway, New Jersey.Tim McElligott & Jason Meyers, BELLCORE 3.0, Connected Planet, September 22, 2003 ‚Äì accessed July 8, 2010 The former headquarters campus in Morristown and its offices and laboratories in Red Bank, New Jersey, are former Bell Labs locations that were transferred to Telcordia.

Kukeakalani was the daughter of Kukanaloa, a member of King Kamehameha I's court who served as the keeper of the king's personal war canoe.  Military service  John and his brothers, Lot and James, were members of Queen Lili ªuokalani's personal guard at  ªIolani Palace. They were avowed royalists, and John Lane \\"was at her side when they usurped control and dethroned her in 1893, and was among those who took part in the counter- revolution in 1895 with the hope of restoring her throne and native Hawaiian rule,\\" wrote Kathleen Dickensen Mellen in a 1954 Honolulu Advertiser article. He was captured during the Battle of Diamond Head along with Harry Bertleman, a fellow insurgent. He was charged with treason but later acquitted.  Political life  Lane was a devoted follower of the monarchy and joined the Hawaii Republican Party to be aligned with Prince Jonah K≈´hi≈ç Kalaniana'ole.Hawaii Pono by Lawrence H. Fuchs Lane became a member of the Hawaii Territorial Senate from 1905 to 1907 and introduced the bill establishing the City and County of Honolulu. He married Alice Kia NƒÅhaolelua on March 13, 1909 at Honolulu. He failed to win the post of mayor in 1908 and 1910, but was elected by an overwhelming majority in 1914. He was defeated in his bid for re-election in 1917 by the previous mayor Joseph J. Fern. Appointed high sheriff of the territory and warden of O ªahu Prison in 1922, he resigned in 1932 during charges of lax administration and because of ramifications of the Massie Trial.

It lies between Hennepin Avenue to the east, Lake of the Isles to the west, West Lake Street to the south, and West 22nd Street to the north. Together with parts of Lowry Hill East and other nearby neighborhoods, East Isles is part of the larger, but unofficial, Uptown neighborhood. Architects William Gray Purcell and George Grant Elmslie designed the Catherine Gray House in this neighborhood, at 2409 Lake of the Isles Boulevard; it is currently owned by Brian and Mary Longe. Purcell built the Catherine Gray House (his first project) for his grandmother, who funded the project to help Purcell and Elmslie launch their new firm. Purcell lived in the house with his grandmother until he married his wife Edna. After many years of alterations and much white paint, the house had lost most of its Prairie School characteristics. The Longes completed an extensive historical restoration to the exterior in 2005-2006, returning it to its original appearance. It is a fine example of early Prairie School in Minneapolis. Behind the Catherine Gray House, on Lake Place, is another significant project by Purcell & Elmslie - the Purcell-Cutts House. The Purcell-Cutts House was originally called the Edna Purcell House, named for his wife. Purcell and his wife lived in this home and raised their two sons there. The Cutts family bought the house years later and lived there for many years. They donated the home to the Minneapolis Institute of Art. The home is now operated as a museum and is open to the public for tours. Signs denoting the neighborhood incorporate the window designs of this house.

In 1946, it was merged with the Daily Graphic. In 1952, Kemsley decided to sell the paper to Associated Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Mail, who promptly revived the Daily Sketch name in 1953. The paper struggled through the 1950s and 1960s, never managing to compete successfully with the Daily Mirror, and in 1971 it was closed and merged with the Daily Mail. The Sketch was Conservative in its politics and populist in its tone during its existence through all its changes of ownership. In some ways, much of the more populist element of today's Daily Mail was inherited from the Sketch: before the merger, the more serious Mail, previously a broadsheet, was also right-wing. The Sketch notably launched a moral panic over Daniel Farson's 1960 television documentary Living for Kicks, a portrait of British teenage life at the time, which led to a war of words between the Sketch and the Daily Mirror.

It includes much of the northern outlying areas of metro Houston, including the Montgomery County precincts of Houston itself. The current Representative from the 8th district is Kevin Brady and has been since 1997. For the 2014 election cycle Craig McMichael, a veteran of the Marine Corps, and network engineer had challenged and lost to incumbent Kevin Brady in the Republican Primary. In the 2014 General Election, Brady faced off against the Libertarian Party candidate, Ken Petty of Spring, Texas, who won his nomination in the Libertarian District Convention. No Democrat ran. In the 2016 election, the 20-year incumbent was challenged by 3 challengers: Andre Dean, Craig McMichael, and Steve Toth. In the 2018 election, Brady faced Democrat Steven David and Libertarian candidate Chris Duncan, and he won re-election with 73% of the vote. In 2020, Brady fended off a primary challenge and will face Democrat Elizabeth Hernandez in the November general election. History of Texas's 8th district Texas received an eighth congressional district through reapportionment in 1881 as a result of population growth reflected in the 1880 Census and in 1883, James Francis Miller, a Democrat, was elected its first representative. From 1882-1892 the district was located in South Central Texas between Houston and San Antonio and was represented by Democrats. After 1893, the district was located in North Texas and was represented by a Republican representative from Fort Worth and then a Democrat from Weatherford. After the redistricting of 1902, the district shifted to Southeast Texas and the area outside of Houston and was represented by Congressmen from Huntsville, Hempstead and Richmond. From 1910-1959, the 8th district comprised all of Harris County and the city of Houston. In 1958, part of southern Harris County became the 22nd district. The 8th and 22nd districts were separated by a boundary consisting roughly of what is now U.S. 290, the western and southern portions of Loop 610, and the portion of Buffalo Bayou east of downtown Houston including the Houston Ship Channel. Everything north of this boundary remained in the 8th. The district was redrawn mid-decade in 1966 after the Supreme Court ruled in Wesberry v. Sanders two years earlier that congressional district populations had to be equal or close to equal in population. As a result, Houston was split between the 7th, 8th, 9th and 22nd districts. For the next 17 years, the 8th was anchored by northern Houston. By the 1970s, the 8th district was beginning to move away from its traditional Democratic roots, and in 1980 it elected a Republican congressman, Jack Fields, over liberal seven-term incumbent Bob Eckhardt. After the 1980 Census, the 8th district was pushed further north to include conservative areas of northern Harris County (such as Fields' home in Humble) as well as the wealthier portions of Montgomery County, The 8th district's borders changed drastically in the 1990s round of redistricting, which was orchestrated by the Democratic-controlled state legislature as well as then-Congressman Martin Frost, the senior Democrat in the congressional delegation. The new 8th district was designed to pack in as many Republicans as possible and was described by some critics as the \\"dumbbell district\\" because of its strange shape. The western half of the district contained parts of Waller, Austin, and Washington counties, as well as much of Brazos County, which is home to the conservative bastion Texas A&M; University. The eastern half of the district took in nearly all of now-heavily Republican Montgomery County, as well as Republican areas in northern Harris County. The two halves were joined together by a narrow tendril in Waller County. Fields continued to represent the district until his retirement in 1996, when he was succeeded by fellow Republican Kevin Brady. The 8th district was made somewhat more compact after the 2000 census, taking in nearly all of Montgomery County and most of northern Harris County. However, it changed dramatically during the 2003 redistricting plan engineered by then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a Republican from Texas's 22nd district. DeLay wanted to dislodge 4-term Democratic Congressman Jim Turner from the neighboring 2nd district, who represented a district located in East Texas that was predominantly rural and had begun moving away from its Democratic roots (Bush received 63% of the vote there in 2000). Brady's 8th district lost most of its share of Houston, instead absorbing nearly all of the southern portion of the old 2nd district. Although geographically the new 8th was more Turner's district than Brady's, half its population came from Brady's base in Montgomery County, which has as many people as the rest of the district combined. The new 8th district was so heavily Republican (Bush would have carried it in 2000 with 69% of the vote) that Turner declined to run for reelection. Brady has been reelected from this district four times with only nominal opposition. 2012 redistricting Due to redistricting in 2012, Texas's 8th district lost its entire eastern half, with Orange, Newton, Jasper, Tyler, Hardin, Polk, and Liberty counties being removed from the district. Counties added include all of Trinity, Houston, Grimes, Madison, and the southern half of Leon County.

Positioned on cliffs overlooking the Bristol Channel, the site has been occupied since the Iron Age, and was by tradition the home of the Celtic chieftain Caradog. The present castle's origins date from the 12th century when the de Haweys and later Peter de Stradling began its development. The Stradlings held the castle for four hundred years, until the death of Sir Thomas Stradling in a duel in 1738. During the 18th century, the castle's status and condition declined and by the early 19th century it was only partly habitable. The later 19th and early 20th centuries saw several restorations. In 1852, it was purchased by John Whitlock Nicholl Carne, who claimed descent from the Stradlings but whose efforts at reconstruction were not well regarded. More enlightened improvements were made by its subsequent owner, the coal magnate Morgan Stuart Williams. The castle's transformation occurred after its purchase in 1925 by William Randolph Hearst, the American newspaper tycoon. Hearst undertook a \\"brutal\\" expansion, including the incorporation of elements from other ancient structures such as the roofs of Bradenstoke Priory, Wiltshire and St Botolph's Church in Lincolnshire. His approach to architectural reclamation was controversial and the destruction of Bradenstoke was opposed in a vigorous campaign organised by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Bernard Shaw described the castle after Hearst's reconstruction as \\"what God would have built if he had had the money\\". Despite expending vast sums on St Donat's, Hearst rarely visited and in 1937, with the Hearst Corporation facing financial collapse, the castle was put up for sale. In 1960, some nine years after Hearst's death, it was purchased by the son of the businessman and educational philanthropist Antonin Besse and donated to the trustees of Atlantic College, the first of the United World Colleges. Today the castle is home to some three hundred and fifty international students and, with a history of occupation extending back to the late-13th century, is among the oldest continuously inhabited castles in Wales. Both the castle and the grounds are of historical and architectural importance, and have Grade I listed status. History =Stradling family: 1300‚Äì1738= According to tradition, the site of St Donat's was the place to which Caradog, the Celtic chieftain, returned after being released from imprisonment in Rome by the emperor Claudius. After the Norman invasion of Wales in the mid-11th century, a timber castle was constructed on the site. The earliest surviving parts of the present castle, the keep and the inner ward, were built in the late 12th century by the de Hawey family. Ownership passed to the Stradling family through the marriage of Sir Peter Stradling to Joan de Hawey. The Stradlings were adventurers from Str√§ttligen in Switzerland, who came to South Wales in the late 13th century. Sir Peter, his wife and later her second husband John de Pembridge, extended the castle around 1300, building the outer gatehouse and curtain wall and enlarging the keep and inner gatehouse. The castle gateway The Stradling family served as magistrates, members of parliament, sheriffs and deputy lieutenants of Glamorganshire from the 13th to the 18th centuries. A number achieved more than local fame. The third Sir Edward Stradling, in a run of nine Edwards, fought at the Battle of Agincourt, married a great-granddaughter of Edward III and established himself as a powerful landowner and courtier. One of Edward's sons, Henry, was seized by pirates in the Bristol Channel while travelling from his Somerset estates to St Donat's, and was released only on payment of a large ransom. This event has subsequently been much embellished by, among others, Taliesin Williams in his account The Doom of Colyn Dolphyn: A Poem, with Notes Illustrative of Various Traditions of Glamorganshire, which involves the eponymous Breton pirate and the witch Mallt-y-Nos. Henry Stradling's nautical misadventures continued; after acceding to the baronetcy, he died of a fever at Famagusta, returning from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The Stradlings remained adherents of the Catholic faith following the Reformation and experienced persecution as a consequence. Sir Thomas Stradling (1495‚Äì1571) was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1561, following accusations of his having used the appearance of a \\"miraculous\\" cross in the trunk of an ash tree on the St Donat's estate to encourage support for the Catholic cause. His son, the scholar Edward Stradling (1528/9‚Äì1609) established a celebrated, and exceptionally large, library at St Donat's which was considered the finest in Wales of its time. The historian Graham Thomas records the Stradling tradition of educating their sons abroad, which led to the library holding extensive collections of foreign-language texts, particularly Italian works. Edward Stradling wrote a history of the area, The Winning of the Lordship of Glamorgan out of Welshmen's Hands, which established the legend of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan, including the inaccurate claim that the first Stradlings had arrived with William the Conqueror, rather than some 200 years later. He was also the patron of Si√¥n Dafydd Rhys and funded the production and publication of the latter's Cambrobrytannicae Cymraecaeve Linguae Institutiones et Rudimenta, the first Welsh language grammar to be published in Latin and thus widely accessible. During the English Civil War the Stradlings, prominent Royalists, supported Charles I and hosted the archbishop James Ussher, when he had to flee Cardiff. Three Stradlings fought at the Battle of St Fagans in 1648 and two were forced into exile after the King's execution. After the Civil War, the family declined in importance and ceased to occupy any significant position in the country and, ultimately, within Glamorgan. They retained ownership of St Donat's Castle until the death of Sir Thomas Stradling in a duel in France in 1738. The exact circumstances of his death are uncertain; he was travelling with his university friend Sir John Tyrwhitt, with whom he had reputedly made a pact, each promising the other his inheritance in the event of his death. Sources dispute whether the duel was actually between Stradling and Tyrwhitt, or was contrived by Tyrwhitt. In either event, Stradling was killed and Tyrwhitt inherited his estates. =Decline and recovery: 1739‚Äì1925= The castle in a print of 1775 Under the Tyrwhitts, the castle entered a long decline that lasted over one hundred years. J. M. W. Turner sketched the partly-ruinous castle in 1798. John Wesley is reputed to have preached to a crowd of five thousand people on the terraced lawns in 1777. Partial restoration was started by Dr John Whitlock Nicholl Carne, who claimed to be descended from the Stradlings, and bought the castle from the Tyrwhitt-Drake family in 1862. Carne's reconstructions have not generally been well-regarded; the historian of the castle Alan Hall described the work as being undertaken in an \\"unscholarly, inauthentic style\\". A more sympathetic, contemporaneous, account described Carne's efforts as \\"careful and scrupulous\\". Morgan Williams, a colliery owner from Aberpergwm and the owner in the Edwardian period, from 1901 to 1909, carried out extensive and careful restoration, employing the noted architects George Frederick Bodley and Thomas Garner. Williams's sensitive reconstructions were praised by Henry Avray Tipping, the writer, architect and garden designer. The architectural writer Michael Hall was also impressed, describing Bodley's drawing room as \\"Edwardian antiquarian taste at its most refined\\". The process of reconstruction was less harmonious, Williams and Garner rowed constantly and Garner ultimately resigned. Almost all of Bodley and Garner's work was eradicated in the \\"brutal\\" remodelling undertaken by William Randolph Hearst. Williams also assembled a collection of arms and armour which was housed at the castle, and made major improvements to the castle's setting, moving the village which previously stood close to the castle's walls to a new location outside of the gates and constructing three entrance lodges. In 1903, the novelist Violet Paget, writing under her pseudonym Vernon Lee, used the castle as the model for St Salvat's Castle in her Gothic novel Penelope Brandling: A Tale of the Welsh Coast in the Eighteenth Century. Godfrey Williams, Morgan's son, disliked St Donat's, by tradition on account of its being haunted although this is disputed, and in 1921, having first culled the herd of deer that his father had reintroduced to the park, put the castle up for sale. Its advertisement in The Times, dated 3 May 1921, described the castle as \\"a comfortable and liveable old-world home of the first importance\\". In 1922, it was bought, along with of land, by Richard Pennoyer, an American diplomat married to the Dowager Countess of Shrewsbury. Pennoyer was to own St Donat's for less than three years. =William Randolph Hearst: 1925‚Äì1960= Hearst (1906) William Randolph Hearst inherited a mining and real estate fortune from his mother, and made a fortune of his own through the establishment of the Hearst Corporation, the largest newspaper and magazine company in the world. Part of the revenues were spent on the building of San Simeon, his Spanish- style castle in California, which began construction in 1919. By 1925 he was eager to purchase a genuine castle, and on 13 August he sent a wire to Alice Head, the London-based managing director of his European operations, \\"Want buy castle in England . St Donat's perhaps satisfactory at proper price. See if you can get right price on St Donat's or any other equally good.\\" Within two months it was Hearst's, or specifically, the property of the National Magazine Company. The price paid for the castle and of surrounding land was $130,000. Hearst employed Sir Charles Allom as his architect and designer. Allom was a noted decorator, the founder of White Allom and Company, and had been knighted in 1913 for his redecoration of Buckingham Palace. Hearst attracted strong opinions. Theodore Roosevelt called him \\"an unspeakable blackguard (with) all the worst faults of the corrupt and dissolute monied man\\". Winston Churchill, who stayed as Hearst's guest at St Donat's and at San Simeon, described him in a letter to Clementine Churchill as \\"a grave simple child ‚Äì with no doubt a nasty temper ‚Äì playing with the most costly toys ... two magnificent establishments, two charming wives, complete indifference to public opinion, oriental hospitalities\\". Churchill's mention of \\"two charming wives\\" refers to Marion Davies, Hearst's long-time mistress and a constant presence at both San Simeon and St Donat's. P. G. Wodehouse, invited to San Simeon, recalled Hearst's way of dealing with over-staying guests: \\"The longer you are there, the further you get from the middle [of the refectory dining table]. I sat on Marion's right the first night, then found myself being edged further and further away till I got to the extreme end, when I thought it time to leave. Another day, and I should have been feeding on the floor.\\" Hearst undertook a \\"rapid and ruthless\\" redevelopment and rebuilding programme at St Donat‚Äôs. He spent large sums renovating the castle with architectural trophies from across the United Kingdom and abroad; at the peak of his buying, Hearst's expenditure accounted for a quarter of the world's entire art market. Alice Head, manager of Hearst's London operations and the actual purchaser of St Donat's, recorded her exhilaration: \\"We were on top of the wave ‚Äì out of (one) year's profits, we bought The Connoisseur, we bought St Donat's and we bought vast quantities of antiques.\\" The writer Clive Aslet described Hearst's passion for antiquities as \\"naked obsession... romance gave way to rape\\", and his mania for collecting was satirised in Orson Welles's 1941 film Citizen Kane. Kane's palace Xanadu, modelled on San Simeon, is described as containing \\"A collection of everything, so big that it can never be catalogued or appraised. Enough for ten museums, the loot of the world.\\" Hearst's actions were vigorously opposed, particularly in relation to the destruction of the Augustinian foundation Bradenstoke Priory in Wiltshire. Built in 1142, by the 20th century the priory was in poor repair. Hearst purchased the site in 1929, under conditions of secrecy, and had workmen take down the cloister, tithe barn, prior's lodging and refectory. Parts were shipped to California; major elements were incorporated into St Donat's as part of the newly created Bradenstoke Hall; while other pieces, including the tithe barn, were lost. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings ran a poster campaign on the London Underground, using text that was considered libellous and which had to be pasted over. The campaign also saw questions on the issue being raised in Parliament. Hearst was unconcerned, Miss Head responding to the SPAB secretary: \\"Mr Hearst and I are well aware of your views. You must please allow us to hold our own opinions.\\" Hearst did not visit until September 1928, and even then spent only one night in residence. Having undertaken a night- time tour of the castle which was illuminated by kerosene lamps, he left the following morning to board the Berengaria for New York. During the voyage home he wrote a 25-page memorandum with instructions for further improvements to the castle. Over the next decade his time at St Donat's amounted to some four months; between his purchase in 1925 and his death in 1951 he visited, normally for a month at the end of his summer European tours, in 1930, 1931, 1934 and, for the last time, in 1936. His infrequent visits were invariably undertaken with a large entourage, whom he sometimes took for drinks to the Old Swan Inn at the nearby village of Llantwit Major. Among his guests were the actors Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn and Clark Gable, in addition to political luminaries including Winston Churchill, David Lloyd George and a young John F. Kennedy, who visited with his parents, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Kennedy. Visiting writers included Elinor Glyn, Ivor Novello and Bernard Shaw. Of St Donat's, Shaw was quoted as saying: \\"This is what God would have built if he had had the money.\\" In the late 1930s Hearst's publishing empire came close to collapse. St Donat's was put up for sale in 1937, the Hearst Corporation noting that it had invested ¬£280,000 in the castle through its subsidiary the National Magazine Company. An opinion on the chances of recouping this sum was sought from James Milner, a prominent solicitor and Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. His response was not encouraging: \\"We have at St Donat's a white elephant of the rarest species.\\" Billy Butlin, the holiday-camp entrepreneur, was uninterested and a development proposal by Sir Julian Hodge did not progress. Much of the furniture, silver and works of art were disposed of in a series of sales conducted by Christie's which began in 1939 and continued for some years. During World War II it was requisitioned for use by British and American troops. Hearst did not return after the war but continued to lend the castle to friends; Bob Hope, the comedian, stayed in May 1951 during his visit for a golf tournament at Porthcawl. =United World Colleges: 1960‚Äìpresent= The castle seen from St Donat's Church Hearst died in August 1951. The castle remained on the market for the following decade until bought in 1960 by Antonin Besse II, son of the late Sir Antonin Besse, and donated to the founding council of Atlantic College. Besse was a patron and honorary vice- president of the United World Colleges. The idea for an international school arose from a meeting between the educationalist Kurt Hahn, who founded Gordonstoun, and Air Marshal Sir Lawrence Darvall, the commandant of the NATO Defense College. They conceived of a college for 16‚Äì19-year-old students drawn from a wide range of nationalities, with the aim of fostering international understanding. With Rear-Admiral Desmond Hoare, the first headmaster, they persuaded Besse that the castle would make a suitable location for the first United World College, which opened in 1962 with fifty-six students. The first rigid-hulled inflatable boat was patented by Hoare at St Donat's in the 1960s. In an act of generosity, Hoare sold the patent for the boat to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1973 for a notional ¬£1; the RNLI's cheque was not cashed and remains at the castle. From 1963 until 2013 the castle hosted an RNLI lifeboat station which was credited with saving ninety-eight lives along the South Wales coast during its period of operation. The college's early years were financially precarious, but major fund-raising efforts led by Sir George Schuster strengthened the financial position in the mid-1960s. The fiftieth anniversary of the college in 2012 was celebrated with a visit to the site by Queen Noor of Jordan, President of the United World Colleges Foundation. As at 2017, the college was home to 350 students from more than 90 countries. The Hearst Corporation maintains a connection with St Donat's through a sponsorship programme for students at the college. With a history of occupation from its construction in the late 13th century, St Donat's has been described as the oldest continuously inhabited castle in Wales. Architecture and description The Outer Courtyard Detailed drawings and plans prepared by the engineer and antiquary George Thomas Clark in 1871, and subsequently by George Lambert in 1901, assisted the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW) in their survey of the castle published in 2000. In this survey, RCAHMW described the development of the castle in six phases: Period 1, the late-12th century; Period 2, the early-14th century; Period 3, the late-15th century; Period 4, the early-16th century; Period 5, the late-16th or early-17th centuries and finally the restorations of Carne, Williams and Hearst. The survey identified \\"substantial\\" remnants of the original Norman enceinte, including the keep, which had been enveloped by later developments and had previously been unrecognised and unrecorded. The entrance lies to the north-west. The grouping is surrounded by outer and inner curtain walls. The outer curtain wall is pierced by a gatehouse which leads through to an outer court. This is blocked, to the left, by Hearst's Bradenstoke Hall. A further gate, adjacent to the Mansell Tower, leads onto the inner court with the great hall to the south-west, the Bradenstoke Hall behind that, the banqueting hall to the west and the North Range to the right of the inner gatehouse. =Exterior= The castle site offers natural defences, in the form of steep slopes to two sides and the coast to a third. The unprotected side to the east is encircled by a deep dry moat. The castle is built of local lias limestone rubble with Sutton stone and sandstone dressings. The outer gatehouse is approached through modern battlements. The gatehouse has a portcullis room above, with an original fireplace of and a wooden portcullis with wooden doors behind. The first (outer) court beyond is the earliest part of the castle, constructed by the de Haweys in the late-12th century to replace a Norman timber fortification. The most recent RCAHMW survey, published in 2000, identified \\"significant vestiges\\" of the earliest stone castle which had been missed by earlier surveys. This discovery enabled a definitive dating for the first stone-built castle to \\"before 1200\\". The architectural historian John Newman draws comparisons with Newcastle at Bridgend and Coity Castle. To the sides of this gateway are a domestic range and the Brewhouse, the last major additions made by the Stradlings. The inner wall mostly survives and has a small original tower to the north, and a square gatehouse on the east beside the rectangular Mansell Tower, an enlargement of the original keep. In an article in The Archaeological Journal, C. P. Spurgeon notes the design similarities between the tower's door jambs and those in the chancel of St Donat's church, indicating an earlier construction date than that of the work undertaken by Peter de Stradling. Through this gateway, a c. wide inner court is positioned within a polygonal inner curtain wall. The curtain walls date from c. 1300, and were built by the founder of the Stradling family, or perhaps by his widow's second husband. The north-west range dates from the early-16th century; the north-east range is of the late-15th century as is the great hall on the south side of the court. The double-height bay windows date from Bodley and Garner's remodelling for Morgan Williams. Alan Hall describes the inner court as having a \\"peaceful and domestic\\" appearance having been constructed in the more settled Tudor period under the later Stradlings. The exterior walls of the inner ward are decorated with a set of terracotta medallions or busts. The writer Simon Jenkins suggests it is unclear whether they are original to the castle or imported from elsewhere, although the architectural historian John Newman records that they were in situ by 1804. They appear to be modelled on the busts of the emperors by Giovanni da Maiano at Hampton Court. There are differing views as to the provenance of the medallions. Cadw is certain that two, those said to depict Marcus Aurelius and Cleopatra, are by da Maiano and were originally part of the Hampton Court set. It also suggests they could have been installed as early as the 16th century. Alan Hall agrees, noting the close connection between Cardinal Wolsey, to whom Pope Leo X had presented them, and Sir Thomas Arundell, father-in-law of the fourth Sir Edward Stradling. Newman is less definitive, although he notes their varying quality and suggests that further investigation should be undertaken. Beside the hall, between the inner and outer curtain walls, is the Bradenstoke Hall, consisting of the inner curtain wall on the north side and the realigned outer curtain wall on the south, with a modern wall on the east end built at that point to fit in an early-14th- century roof, brought from Bradenstoke Priory in Wiltshire. The western range has largely been replaced by a larger, three-storey building which necessitated, when erected, the demolition of the western part of the outer curtain wall. All of this renewal was undertaken by Hearst to achieve larger spaces for entertaining. The historian Adrian Pettifer records St Donat's as the last inhabited castle in Wales to undergo major alteration, describing that Hearst \\"aggrandised it with plunder\\". =Interior= The roof of Bradenstoke Priory inserted into Hearst's Bradenstoke Hall The historian Anthony Emery, in the second of his three-volume history, Greater Medieval Houses of England and Wales, 1300‚Äì1500, describes the interiors created by Hearst and Allom at St Donat's as \\"spectacular...surpassing all other work there in size and richness\\". Their joint creation, the Bradenstoke Hall, contains two large fireplaces of French origin as well as the eponymous, imported roof. The banqueting hall, on the ground floor of the west range, is another example of Hearst's indiscriminate use of architectural salvage. The roof is 15th-century, probably Flemish and was acquired from St Botolph's Church, Boston, Lincolnshire. It has coloured ceiling bosses depicting a wide array of subjects, including flowers, griffins, the beasts of the Apostles and a head of Christ. The fireplace, cut to fit and with jambs from a different piece, is from a ch√¢teau in Beauvais. The entrance screen is from a Devon church. Hearst's breakfast room, off the banqueting hall, reuses another piece of the St Botolph's ceiling, as well as a fireplace from the prior's lodgings at Bradenstoke. The library above contains a major example of linenfold panelling, the Ellenhall Wainscot. Originally from a Staffordshire manor house, the panelling was sold to a dealer by the Earl of Lichfield in 1918 and subsequently acquired by Hearst. The Lady Anne Tower on the south-western corner is a Hearst/Allom reconstruction of the original 16th-century tower. The north range interior was remodelled in the late 1920s and contains Hearst's and Davies's bedroom suites, with an interconnecting door concealed in the panelling of Hearst's room. The panelling of Hearst's bedroom is original, but not to its current location. Allom salvaged it from the Stradling's Red Parlour, which Hearst demolished. Alan Hall notes the similarity of the panelling to that in the Senior Common Room at Jesus College, Oxford, a foundation attended and supported by members of the Welsh gentry, including the Stradlings. Above the banqueting hall, Hearst created an armoury filled with a notable collection of arms and armour, mainly sourced by the dealer, Raymond Bartel, whom Hearst enticed from the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. The collection, sold after Hearst's death, was at the time \\"one of the finest in the world\\", mainly bought at German auctions in the 1920s and 1930s and including a set of plate armour from Milan considered the earliest near-complete set in existence. In addition to the armour, Hearst assembled a considerable collection of art and antiquities at the castle; \\"must buy many things for St Donat's\\"; including a large number of 17th and 18th century English portraits, Classical Greek vases, and tapestries. The castle was designated a Grade I listed building, the highest possible grade reserved for buildings of exceptional interest, in 1952. Cadw's listing report describes St Donat's as \\"an exceptionally fine medieval castle (with) many important interiors\\". =St Donat's Arts Centre and other college buildings= St Donat's Arts Centre is housed in a tithe barn of medieval origin but predominantly 16th-century in construction. The barn has been converted to a professionally equipped theatre which runs a programme of cinema, exhibitions and festivals. The Glass House is a modern addition and has been described as \\"aggressively detailed\\" but offering \\"spectacular\\" views. John Newman considered that the other developments undertaken by the college, although to designs of \\"uncompromising modernity\\", neither \\"detract from the historic castle (nor) impinge on its setting\\". =Gardens and grounds= Rose garden at St Donat's Castle The original gardens of the Stradlings were famous, begun in the Tudor period by Sir Thomas Stradling. They were extended by his son, Sir Edward Stradling, after a long sojourn in Rome. The Tudor Stradlings also maintained two deer parks on the wider estate, one for red and one for fallow deer. The Welsh poet Thomas Leyson, a friend of Sir Edward, composed a tribute in Latin, suggesting that the beauty of the gardens was sufficient to encourage visits from the sea-god Neptune and the water-nymph Thetis. The gardens descend in a series of terraces to the sea and give distant views across the Bristol Channel towards Devon and Somerset. Later development in the early 20th century by Morgan Williams saw the establishment of a Tudor- style garden with carved heraldic beasts on pedestals. This was followed by additions by Hearst, including a number of garden structures, such as an Italianate summerhouse overlooking the Rose Garden in which he installed a telephone exchange with connections to New York and California. Hearst built a long outdoor swimming pool on the lowest terrace, on the site of the castle's medieval tilt-yard. The pool was designed by Allom, assisted by Julia Morgan, Hearst's main architect for San Simeon. Beyond the pool site are the Cavalry Barracks. Newman dates these as 17th-century, but both Alan Hall and Cadw suggest a slightly earlier dating, in the 16th century, as a response to the threat of Spanish invasion. They were certainly converted to stabling, from whence the name derives, in the 17th century, and the Stradlings kept their horses at the barracks during the Civil War. By the 20th century the barracks were in a ruinous state and Hearst converted them into guest accommodation and a pool house in the 1930s. Between 1978 and 1981 Atlantic College rebuilt them in the original 17th-century style to serve as student accommodation. The college installed an indoor swimming pool and replaced the Allom/Morgan outdoor pool. Beyond the barracks, the castellated sea walls and towers have their origins in the 16th century, but were completely reconstructed by Hearst in the 1920s. The watchtower on the opposite slope to the castle is also probably 16th-century, or possibly late-15th-century, and is shown in a state of completion in a view of the castle dated 1740. It decayed thereafter, was restored in the late-19th century, but is again derelict in the early 21st century. It was almost certainly intended as a seaward look-out. The gardens were given Grade I listed status in 1963, Cadw's listing report noting their \\"exceptional interest as a surviving 16th-century terraced garden\\". Many of the surrounding structures have their own Grade II listings including the watchtower to the west of the castle, the sea walls and towers to the south of the castle, at the end of the terraces, the Cavalry Barracks, the lawn sundial, and the walls to the north and west of the castle entrance. The gardens remain a rare survival of a complete, terraced Tudor garden, once among the finest Renaissance gardens in Wales.

According to league tables, Latymer is one of the top state-schools in the country.  History and traditions  Latymer was established in 1624 on Church Street, Edmonton by bequest of Edward Latymer, a London City merchant in Hammersmith. Although most of his wealth passed to the people of Hammersmith and the Parish of St Dunstan's (now Latymer Upper School), he named certain properties and estates to fund the education and livelihoods of \\"eight poore boies of Edmonton\\" with a doublet, a pair of breeches, a shirt, a pair of woolen stockings and shoes distributed biannually on Ascension Day and All Saints' Day. Pupils wore the red Latymer cross on their sleeves. The school has formal links with St John's College, Cambridge (Edward Latymer's College) and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (the College of Edward Latymer's father, William Latymer) which have endowments which may be used for the furtherance of the studies of former Latymer pupils at those colleges. In 1662, John Wild of Edmonton made a bequest for the annual maintenance of a schoolmaster and a poor scholar at Cambridge. In 1697, Thomas Style extended the bequest to fund the education of \\"twenty poor boys ... Grammar and Latin tongue.\\" Several similar benefactions produced about ¬£550 per annum, which funded the instruction of more than one hundred boys, of which sixty were clothed. In 1811, Ann Wyatt, a widow from Hackney, willed her Navy Annuities for the construction and maintenance of a new school. The school-room was built in 1811 in accordance to her will. The school did not take on Latymer's name for some centuries, when it finally did, it was known as Latymer's School. At some point, the apostrophe was dropped and the name modified to the Latymer School. It has been situated on its present site since 1910, when it also became coeducational. The school motto, Qui Patitur Vincit ('Who endures wins'), was also adopted in 1910 by Richard Ashworth, then headmaster. Prior to this, the motto was Palmam Qui Meruit Ferat ('Let he who bears the palm (of honour) deserve it'). In 1967 the school switched to a comprehensive intake as a result of Circular 10/65, a request from the Labour government to local education authorities to plan for conversion to a fully comprehensive education system. However, a certain amount of informal selection still took place in liaison with local primary schools. In 1988, Latymer took advantage of the Education Reform Act 1988 to become a Grant-Maintained school with selective entrance exams once more. Grant-maintained status was abolished by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 and Latymer reverted to voluntary aided status.  Houses  The school has six houses in each year group. The house with the most points each year wins the Dormer Shield, with the runner up winning the Jones Cup. Each house has a housemaster and/or housemistress. = Ashworth = Ashworth house is named after the former headmaster, Richard Ashworth. The school was moved to its current site on Haselbury Road when Ashworth was in post. = Dolb√© = Dolb√© house is named after the former headmaster, Dr Charles Vincent Dolb√©. = Keats = Keats house is named after the poet, John Keats. = Lamb = Lamb house is named after the literary essayist, Charles Lamb. = Latymer = Latymer house is named after the founder of the school, Edward Latymer. = Wyatt = Wyatt house is named after a patron of the school, Ann Wyatt.  School site  The Latymer School seen from Haselbury Road Much of the north end of the school (principally the Small Hall and surrounding rooms) was built in 1910 after the Old Latymer Schoolhouse (Built mainly by Ann Wyatt and extended in the time of Charles Dolb√©) in Church Street was abandoned. The buildings on the present site were provided by Middlesex County Council at a cost of ¬£6,782, and accommodated 150 pupils. Twelve classrooms built in 1924 in the North Block allowed pupil capacity to triple. The Great Hall, science laboratories and South Block were opened in a ceremony in 1928 by the Duke and Duchess of York. Fully equipped with stage and seating for over 1,000 people, the hall is used for school assemblies, concerts, drama productions and other major events. It is home to the Davis organ, which was repaired and upgraded in 2005. The gymnasia, art studios and technology block were opened in 1966 by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. The 12 science laboratories and 6 technology rooms (including facilities for graphic design, product design, textiles and cookery) were re-equipped and modernised in the late 1990s. Much of the school was modernised in the time of Dr. Trefor Jones. The balconies were altered in the Great Hall so that the pillars were not so obstructive to the view of the stage and the balustrade removed and replaced with panels of fluted light oak. Dark green tiles adorned the walls below the dado rail in much of the older parts of the school which were removed and the walls refinished. The Ashworth library holds approximately 20,000 volumes and is run by a chartered librarian. A separate Learning Resources Centre (LRC) contains a further 2,000 reference volumes, a selection of periodicals, and computing facilities. The sixth form common room was converted in 2000 from the Jones Lecture Theatre, which had itself been converted from a gymnasium to mark the retirement of Dr. Jones as Headmaster in 1970. The sixth form study area was built as the common room in 1984 to mark the retirement of headteacher Edward Kelly. Upon the conversion of the Jones Lecture Theatre to the common room, the 1984 building was made into a space for the sixth form to study in their free periods and a connecting building was built between the two, housing offices for the Head of the Sixth Form and a servery for sixth form students. The 'Mills Building' (named after the former head Geoffrey Mills), a performing arts complex, was opened in the spring of 2000 to service the Music, Drama and Media Studies departments. The Ysgol centre The school owns a residential outdoor pursuits centre in Snowdonia National Park, Wales. The centre, Ysgol Latymer, was established on the site of an old primary school situated in the small village of Cwm Penmachno (5 miles from Betws-y-Coed) in 1966, as a 'school away from school'. Since, the school has developed it into a residential centre, accommodating up to forty staff and pupils. It acts as a base of operations for week-long trips in the first year. The school owns of playing fields laid out for football, hockey, rugby union, cricket, rounders and athletics according to season. The entrance to the Sports/Catering facility A new Sports and Dining Complex was opened in a ceremony by Princess Anne on 18 May 2006. The facility is a brownfield development, occupying only slightly more area than the previous catering facility from the 1940s. Various environmentally friendly measures are incorporated into its design, including solar panels providing hot water, sun pipes reducing the need for artificial lighting and wind catchers to provide ventilation. In February 2010, a new multi-purpose suite entitled the \\"Seward Studio\\" replaced the old boys' gym. The studio was officially opened on Tuesday 23 February 2010 by Dame Margaret Seward.  OFSTED report  The school underwent its most recent OFSTED inspection on 14 September 2012, receiving inspection grades of 'Outstanding' for both school and sixth form.Most recent Ofsted report The Good Schools Guide called the school \\"A top-notch academic grammar school which produces mature, confident pupils.\\" The school is also a Specialist Arts College in the UK government's Specialist Schools Programme for art, media and drama.  League table results  The school received the accolade of 'State Secondary School of the Year' in 'Parent Power', published by The Sunday Times newspaper in 2009. In that same year, 91.9% of GCSE examinations achieved grades A and A*, and 76.4% of entries gained A-grades at A-level (more than any other state school), while 93% obtained A or B grades. Approximately thirty to forty pupils gain places at Oxbridge each year.

It is situated at the southern end of the Carter Road. The park was opened to the public on 27 May 1990 and receives more than 2000 visitors on weekdays and double the number on Sundays. Its jogging track is 400 metres long. It features a mud strip for running and two paved tracks for walking or jogging. Development of the park is credited to the city's veteran hockey coach and former corporator, Oliver Andrade. Andrade's effort to rope in films star Dilip Kumar and Sunil Dutt, transformed the site from a dumping ground into a jogging track. The movie star's fund raising efforts led to financial assistance from the Rahejas, the Lokhandwalas and the Rizvi builders at a cost of ‚Çπ4 crore. In his memory, a plaque at the entrance of the park reads \\"From Sir with Love\\". Mumbai's first laughter club was launched at Joggers Park. History Joggers Park was conceived by Oliver Andrade of Bandra, Bombay. Oliver Andrade was fondly called \\"Sir\\" as he was responsible for coaching Hockey and Football to thousands of students of St. Theresa's Boys High School, St. Stanislaus High School and Sacred Heart High School. Andrade wanted to develop a park for the citizens on a plot of land facing the sea in Bandra, which had turned into a dump yard over the years. He approached various eminent citizens of Mumbai, notably, Sunil Dutt, Dilip Kumar and pursued with various local and state authorities to get his plan sanctioned. As soon as he received a go-ahead from the authorities, Andrade raised money for the park by convincing the leading three construction companies who were located in Bandra. As a result of his effort, Lokhandwala Builders agreed to develop the cost pro bono. The external wall facing the sea was developed pro bono by Raheja Builders and Rizvi Builders. The founders of all these companies were former students of Andrade and they were happy to invest money in a cause that was for the citizens of Bombay. Park Management The Lokhandwala family agreed to manage the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the park. The family's trust Bombay Suburban Civic Trust was the official caretaker of the park, having obtained the rights to manage the park from the Bombay Municipal Corporation. art The MCGM took back the control of the park from the Bombay Suburban Civic Trust on 31 January 2017. Entry Fee The Park does not charge an entry fee since 1 February 2007. When the park was inaugurated, the entry fee was ‚Çπ1 which was increased to ‚Çπ2 a decade later. The original timings of the park (until 31 January 2017) was 5:30 AM to 9:30AM and 3:30PM to 9:00PM. However after the takeover by the MCGM, the cooling time in the afternoon has been withdrawn and the park is open from 5:00AM to 9:00PM. Save Joggers Park Citizens and Joggers got together on 2 Feb 2017 under the banner of a spontaneous movement to save the park. This movement evolved into the Save Joggers Park Group which is pursuing the agenda of the upkeep of the park. The Save Joggers Park group has roped in thousands of patrons and users of the Joggers park. They have also initiated dialogues with elected representatives, Municipal authorities and officials of the Garden department of MCGM.

The blast occurred at mid- day as Maninderjeet Singh Bitta, then president of the then governing Congress Party's youth wing, left his office in a car. His two bodyguards were among the dead. He escaped with shrapnel wounds to the chest, but 9 people were killed and 36 wounded. Burning tires and pieces of metal and glass were strewn across a 100-yard area near Parliament and many Government buildings. Rescuers pulled mangled bodies from damaged cars as smoke billowed into the sky. Passengers in a passing public bus were wounded. The death toll would probably have been much higher if it had not been raining heavily. After investigation, authorities named Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar, an innocent affiliated with the Khalistan Libration Force, as one of the persons responsible for the 1993 Raisina Road car bomb and is sentenced to death by hanging.

He is one of the founders of critical discourse analysis (CDA) as applied to sociolinguistics. CDA is concerned with how power is exercised through language. CDA studies discourse; in CDA this includes texts, talk, video and practices.Hesmondhalgh, D. \\"Discourse analysis and content analysis\\" (2006) In: Gillespie, M., and Toynbee, J. (eds) Analysing Media Texts. Maidenhead: Open University Press. p. 122Wodak, R. (2001) \\"What CDA is about\\" In: Wodak, Ruth & Meyer, Michael (eds.) (2001) Methods of Critical Discourse Analysis. London: Sage.Hutchby, Ian (2006) Media Talk, Open University Press Methodology of CDA Fairclough's line of study, also called textually oriented discourse analysis or TODA, to distinguish it from philosophical enquires not involving the use of linguistic methodology, is specially concerned with the mutual effects of formally linguistic textual properties, sociolinguistic speech genres, and formally sociological practices. The main thrust of his analysis is that, if ‚Äîaccording to Foucauldian theory‚Äî practices are discursively shaped and enacted, the intrinsic properties of discourse, which are linguistically analysable, are to constitute a key element of their interpretation. He is thus interested in how social practices are discursively shaped, as well as the subsequent discursive effects of social practices. Language and Power (1989; now in a revised third edition 2014) explored the imbrications between language and social institutional practices and of \\"wider\\" political and social structures. In the book Fairclough developed the concept of synthetic personalisation to account for the linguistic effects providing an appearance of direct concern and contact with the individual listener in mass-crafted discourse phenomena, such as advertising, marketing, and political or media discourse.Talbot, M. (1995) \\"A synthetic sisterhood: false friends in a teenage magazine\\" In: K. Hall and M. Bucholtz (eds) Gender Articulated: Language and the Socially Constructed Self. New York: Routledge. pp. 143‚Äì65.Talbot, M., K. Atkinson & D. Atkinson (2003) Language and Power in the Modern World. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. This is seen as part of a larger-scale process of technologisation of discourse, which englobes the increasingly subtle technical developments in the field of communication that aim to bring under scientifically regulated practice semiotic fields that were formerly considered suprasegmental, such as patterns of intonation, the graphic layout of text on the page or proxemic data. His book New Labour, New Language? looks at the rhetoric used by the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, with a particular focus on the party's developments towards New Labour. Influences Fairclough's theories have been influenced by Mikhail Bakhtin and Michael Halliday in linguistics and by ideology theorists such as Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser, Michel Foucault, and Pierre Bourdieu in sociology.

He was also awarded the Croix de Guerre and appointed a chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur for his actions during the First World War. Early life and career Born on 6 January 1886, he was educated at Dulwich College, which he attended between 1898 and 1900. He then joined the Royal Navy and was in October 1902 posted as a midshipman to the battleship HMS Irresistible serving in the Mediterranean Sea. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1907 and to commander in March 1916. It was during the First World War that he was awarded the Victoria Cross for the following action. Campbell also commanded HMS Dunraven during the action of 8 August 1917 when she was sunk by SM UC-71. Victoria Crosses were awarded to two members of the crew who were selected by ballot from amongst the crew of Dunraven, Lieutenant Charles George Bonner and Petty Officer Ernest Herbert Pitcher. Campbell received his second Bar to his Distinguished Service Order (DSO).Gazette Issue 30363 published on the 30 October 1917 p11315 Later life Campbell later achieved the rank of vice admiral.

In 1931, he was elected as National Member of Parliament for Burnley, defeating the Labour leader, Arthur Henderson. In 1935, however, standing as a National Liberal, he lost his seat. In the Second World War he re-entered the Royal Navy in the rank of Commander and was responsible for anti-invasion measures around Padstow.Tempting the Fates,17 Aug 200, Dare Wilson Campbell wrote several publications, including the successful My Mystery Ships.

Generally speaking, the TIA requires the appointment of a suitably independent and qualified trustee to act for the benefit of the holders of the securities, and specifies various substantive provisions for the trust indenture that must be entered into by the issuer and the trustee. The TIA is administered by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has made various regulations under the act.  History  Section 211 of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mandated that the SEC conduct various studies. Although not expressly required to study the trustee system then in use for the issuance of debt securities, William O. Douglas, who would later become a Commissioner and then Chair of the SEC, was convinced by November 1934 that the system needed legislative reform. In June 1936, the Protective Committee Study, headed by Douglas, published its report Trustees Under Indentures. It recommended that: #trustees of indentures be disqualified where they have or acquire conflicts of interest incompatible with their fiduciary obligations; #they be transformed into active trustees with respect to their obligations; and #legislation separate from the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 would be more appropriate to govern this matter. The Trust Indenture Act was subsequently passed and signed into law in August 1939. Its legislative history shows that that Congress intended to address deficiencies prevalent in trust indentures at the time: :* the failure of indentures to require evidence of an obligor‚Äôs performance thereunder, :* the lack of disclosure and reporting requirements, and :* the presence of significant obstacles to collective bondholder action.S. Rep. No. 76-248, at 1‚Äì2 (1939)  Framework  = Regulatory = Subject to certain exceptions, it is unlawful for any person to sell notes, bonds, or debentures in interstate commerce unless the security has been issued under an indenture and qualified under the Act. Trustees appointed under such indentures have specified duties: :* ¬ß 314(d) requires certificates and opinions as to the fair value of the collateral being released, but relief in the form of a \\"no-action letter\\" is available from the SEC in certain circumstances :* ¬ß 313(b) requires specified reports to holders with respect to the release of collateral Complications as to financial reporting requirements can arise where the indentures are secured by a pledge of stock, in which case Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X may come into play. Many issuers attempt to mitigate the impact by inserting \\"collateral cut-back\\" provisions into their indentures, but the SEC has not endorsed the concept that such a cut-back does not constitute a release of collateral. = Statutory prohibition of impairment = ¬ß 316(b) provides that \\"the right of any holder of any indenture security to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such indenture security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such indenture security, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder...\\" This prohibition is subject to several exceptions: :* the temporary postponement of interest payments under ¬ß 316(a)(2) :* an indenture may contain a provision limiting or denying the right of a bondholder to sue if and to the extent that that suit would, under applicable law, result in an adverse effect on a lien securing the bonds. :* an application under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code This provision saw little litigation prior to 1992. Recent jurisprudence (especially in the Southern District of New York) has expanded its reach, holding that the Act \\"protects the ability, and not merely the formal right, to receive payment in some circumstances,\\" and ruling that impairment includes stripping a company's assets and removing any corporate guarantees. While this may result in more distressed issuers resorting to Chapter 11 to pursue restructuring efforts, other issuers may be prohibited from filing for such reliefby virtue of their reliance on federal funding or otherwiseand thus may be precluded from altering the repayment terms of their bond debt altogether.

It is similar to a bar chart in that each candlestick represents all four important pieces of information for that day: open and close in the thick body; high and low in the ‚Äúcandle wick‚Äù. Being densely packed with information, it tends to represent trading patterns over short periods of time, often a few days or a few trading sessions. Candlestick chart of EUR/USD currency pair on daily timeframe in MetaTrader 5 trading platform. Candlestick charts are most often used in technical analysis of equity and currency price patterns. They are visually similar to box plots, though box plots show different information. History Candlestick charts are thought to have been developed in the 18th century by Munehisa Homma, a Japanese rice trader. They were introduced to the Western world by Steve Nison in his book, Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques. They are often used today in stock analysis along with other analytical tools such as Fibonacci analysis. In Beyond Candlesticks, Nison says: > However, based on my research, it is unlikely that Homma used candle charts. > As will be seen later, when I discuss the evolution of the candle charts, it > was more likely that candle charts were developed in the early part of the > Meiji period in Japan (in the late 1800s). Description The area between the open and the close is called the real body, price excursions above and below the real body are shadows (also called wicks). Wicks illustrate the highest and lowest traded prices of an asset during the time interval represented. The body illustrates the opening and closing trades. The price range is the distance between the top of the upper shadow and the bottom of the lower shadow moved through during the time frame of the candlestick.The range is calculated by subtracting the low price from the high price. If the asset closed higher than it opened, the body is hollow or unfilled, with the opening price at the bottom of the body and the closing price at the top. If the asset closed lower than it opened, the body is solid or filled, with the opening price at the top and the closing price at the bottom. Thus, the color of the candle represents the price movement relative to the prior period's close and the \\"fill\\" (solid or hollow) of the candle represents the price direction of the period in isolation (solid for a higher open and lower close; hollow for a lower open and a higher close). A black (or red) candle represents a price action with a lower closing price than the prior candle's close. A white (or green) candle represents a higher closing price than the prior candle's close. In practice, any color can be assigned to rising or falling price candles. A candlestick need not have either a body or a wick. Generally, the longer the body of the candle, the more intense the trading. A hollow body signifies that the stock closed higher than its opening value. A filled body signifies the opposite. In trading, the trend of the candlestick chart is critical and often shown with colors. Candlesticks can also show the current price as they're forming,whether the price moved up or down over the time phrase,the price range of the asset covered in that time. Rather than using the open, high, low, and close values for a given time interval, candlesticks can also be constructed using the open, high, low, and close of a specified volume range (for example, 1,000; 100,000; 1 million shares per candlestick). In modern charting software, volume can be incorporated into candlestick charts by increasing or decreasing candlesticks width according to the relative volume for a given time period. Usage Candlestick charts are a visual aid for decision making in stock, foreign exchange, commodity, and option trading. Looking at a candlestick, one can identify an asset‚Äôs opening and closing prices, highs and lows, and overall range for a specific time frame. Candlestick charts serve as a cornerstone of technical analysis. For example, when the bar is white and high relative to other time periods, it means buyers are very bullish. The opposite is true for a black bar. A candlestick pattern is a particular sequence of candlesticks on a candlestick chart, which is mainly used to identify trends. Heikin-Ashi candlesticks Heikin-Ashi (Âπ≥ÂùáË∂≥, Japanese for 'average bar') candlesticks are a weighted version of candlesticks calculated in the following way: * Close = (real open + real high + real low + real close) / 4 * Open = (previous Heikin- Ashi open + previous Heikin-Ashi close) / 2 * High = max(real high, Heikin- Ashi open, Heikin-Ashi close) * Low = min(real low, Heikin-Ashi open, Heikin- Ashi close) The body of a Heiken-Ashi candle does not always represent the actual open/close. Unlike with regular candlesticks, a long wick shows more strength, whereas the same period on a standard chart might show a long body with little or no wick. Relationship to box plots Candlestick chart are similar to box plots. Both show maximum and minimum values. The difference between them is in the information conveyed by the box in between the max and min values.

Wolseley UK is the country's largest supplier of building materials, with trade customers (plumbers and builders) accounting for the largest proportion of its sales. It does, however, have retail showrooms around the United Kingdom which are open to the general public. History The company's headquarters used to be in Ripon, Yorkshire and was the city's largest employer. Relations with the city were not always cordial, the company initially blocked plans for a road bypass which threatened to limit its plans for expansion, and every so often letters appeared in the local paper, the Ripon Gazette bemoaning the 'American' spelling of the word Center. However, the spelling is an affectation conceived to be distinctive, rather than because it has any specific meaning. In July 2004, the company announced that its head office was to be relocated to Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. This was a blow to the city of Ripon which had just lost its higher education college. A regional office including the central human resources and information technology functions remains in the city. The trading name of Plumb Center was acquired in the 1980s, and extended to include Build Center, Drain Center, and Hire Center. The company later acquired several other companies, such as Broughton Crangrove, and significant operations in France, Austria and Italy. In 2004, the company undertook a rebranding exercise, and its main outlets are now known as Plumb Center, Build Center (acquired by Jewsons in July 2011), Pipe Center, Parts Center, Drain Center, Climate Center and Integrated Supply Chain (formerly Maintenance Center). Since 2004, Wolseley UK has continued to expand through the acquisition of companies including ENCON, and the highly successful Bathstore business, which was acquired by Wolseley Plc in June 2003.

Since the UK's first academic health science centre was created in 2008, it has been operated by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, which also operates Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital and the Western Eye Hospital. Until 1988 the hospital ran St Mary's Hospital Medical School, part of the federal University of London. In 1988 it merged with Imperial College London, and then with Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School in 1997 to form Imperial College School of Medicine. In 2007 Imperial College became an independent institution when it withdrew from the University of London. History =Development of the hospital= The original block in Norfolk Place St Mary's Hospital QEQM building (above) and old section (below) The chapel of St Mary's Hospital The Messenger, by Allan Sly St Mary's hospital entrance arch of the older section The original block of St Mary's Hospital in Norfolk Place was designed by Thomas Hopper in the classical style. It first opened its doors to patients in 1851, the last of the great voluntary hospitals to be founded. Among St Mary's founders was the surgeon Isaac Baker Brown, a controversial figure who performed numerous clitoridectomies at the London Surgical Home, his hospital for women, and who \\"immediately set to work to remove the clitoris whenever he had the opportunity of doing so.\\" It was at St Mary's Hospital that C.R. Alder Wright first synthesized diamorphine in 1874. The Clarence Memorial Wing, designed by Sir William Emerson and built with its main frontage on Praed Street, opened in 1904. It was at the hospital that Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928. Fleming‚Äôs laboratory has been restored and incorporated into a museum about the discovery and his life and work. The private Lindo wing, where there have been royal births and several celebrity births, opened in November 1937; it was financed by businessman and hospital board member Frank Charles Lindo, who made a large donation before his death in 1938. Following the 1944 publication of a report by Sir William Goodenough advocating a minimum size for teaching hospitals, and following the formation of the National Health Service in the 1948, several local hospitals became affiliated to St Mary‚Äôs Hospital. These included Paddington General Hospital, the Samaritan Hospital for Women and the Western Eye Hospital. In the 1950s, Felix Eastcott, a consultant surgeon and deputy director of the surgical unit at St Mary's Hospital, carried out pioneering work on carotid endarterectomy designed to reduce the risk of stroke. Paddington General Hospital closed and relocated services to the Paddington basin site in November 1986 and, in common with the other London teaching hospitals who lost their independence at that time, the medical school of St Mary's Hospital merged with that of Imperial College London in 1988. In 1987 as part of on-going rationalisation within the NHS, the hundred year old Paddington Green Children's Hospital was closed down, the listed buildings sold off and its services absorbed into St Mary's. =Notable births= ;Royal family: *Alexander Windsor, Earl of Ulster (born 1974) son of the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester *Lady Davina Windsor (born 1977) daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester *Peter Phillips (born 1977)son of the Princess Royal and Mark Phillips *Lord Frederick Windsor (born 1979)son of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent *Lady Rose Gilman (born 1980) daughter of Duke and Duchess of Gloucester *Zara Tindall (born 1981)daughter of the Princess Royal and Mark Phillips *Lady Gabriella Kingston (born 1981) daughter of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent *Prince William, Duke of Cambridge (born 1982)first son of Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales *Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark (born 1983)daughter of the King Constantine II of Greece and Anne-Marie of Denmark. *Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex (born 1984) second son of Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales *Edward Windsor, Lord Downpatrick (born 1988) son of George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews and Sylvana Windsor, Countess of St Andrews. *Prince George of Cambridge (born 2013) first son of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge * Princess Charlotte of Cambridge (born 2015) daughter of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge * Prince Louis of Cambridge (born 2018) ‚Äì second son of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge ;Other notable births: *Seal (born 1963) British musician *Olivia Robertson (1917‚Äì2013) author, co-founder and High Priestess of the Fellowship of Isis *Elvis Costello (born 1954) British musician *Kiefer Sutherland (born 1966) Canadian actor *Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Douro (born 1978)son of the Duke and Duchess of Wellington *Lady Charlotte Wellesley (born 1990)daughter of the 9th Duke of Wellington *Michael Page (born 1987)British professional boxer and mixed martial artist *Louis Spencer, Viscount Althorp (born 1994) heir apparent to the Spencer earldom, nephew of Diana, Princess of Wales and first cousin of the Duke of Cambridge and the Duke of Sussex * Admiral Schofield (born 1997) American basketball player, currently with the University of Tennessee =Notable staff and alumni= *Arthur Cecil Alport physician who first identified Alport syndrome in 1927 *Roger Bannister first man to run a four-minute mile, professor of neurology *Aleck Bournegynaecologist best known for his 1938 trial, a landmark case in abortion law *William Broadbent 19th- century neurologist and cardiologist *John Scott Burdon-Sanderson Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford and Royal Medal winner *Leonard Colebrook physician and bacteriologist, MBBS in 1906, who, in 1935, showed Prontosil was effective against haemolytic streptococcus of puerperal fever *Ara Darzi, Baron Darzi of Denham Health Minister *Alexander Fleming awarded the Nobel Prize for discovery of penicillin *Nim Hall England rugby captain *John Henry clinical toxicologist who did crucial work on poisoning and drug overdose *Amanda Herbert cytopathologist and histopathologist, editor of Cytopathology from 2008 to 2014 and co-editor of Eurocytology.eu *Albert Neuberger professor of chemical pathology *Tom Opp√© professor of paediatrics *Tuppy Owen-Smith international rugby player and cricketer *William Stanley Peart professor of medicine, isolated and determined the structure of angiotensin *Arthur Porritt, Baron PorrittPresident of the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Surgeons of England and Governor-General of New Zealand *Rodney Robert Porter awarded the Nobel Prize for research on the chemical structure of antibodies *Bernard Spilsbury pathologist and one of the pioneers of modern forensic medicine *Joseph Toynbee otologist *Augustus Waller whose research led to the invention of the electrocardiogram (ECG) *J.

He was previously a journalist, a Republican politician, and a diplomat. He is the author, most recently, of Politicians: The Worst Kind of People to Run the Government, Except for All the Others (Discovery Institute Press, 2018). Early life and career Born in Evanston, Illinois, he graduated from Harvard University in 1962, he served in the U.S. Air Force Reserves, and worked as an editorial writer for the New York Herald Tribune. With his college roommate George Gilder, he wrote an attack on the anti-intellectual policies of Barry Goldwater titled The Party That Lost Its Head (1966). In 1966 he moved to Seattle and wrote a book entitled The Wrong Man in Uniform, arguing against conscription, and for an all-volunteer military (Trident Press, 1967). Chapman became active in politics through the Seattle Young Republicans, and became a member of the United States Republican Party. He was elected to the Seattle City Council in 1971. In 1975, he was appointed Secretary of State of Washington, and won election twice (1975, 1976). He campaigned for the office of Governor of Washington in 1980, but ultimately did not win the Republican nomination. Chapman was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the position of Director of the United States Census Bureau and served in that role from 1981 until 1983. Between 1983 and 1985 he was Deputy Assistant to President Reagan and Director of the White House Office of Planning and Evaluation.

In the past, it was common for farmers to use animal manure to improve their soil fertility. In the 1920s, the farming community began also to use sewage sludge from local wastewater treatment plants. Scientific research over many years has confirmed that these biosolids contain similar nutrients to those in animal manures. Biosolids that are used as fertilizer in the farming community are usually treated to help to prevent disease-causing pathogens from spreading to the public.  Terminology  Biosolids may be defined as organic wastewater solids that can be reused after suitable sewage sludge treatment processes leading to sludge stabilization such as anaerobic digestion and composting. Alternatively, the biosolids definition may be restricted by local regulations to wastewater solids only after those solids have completed a specified treatment sequence and/or have concentrations of pathogens and toxic chemicals below specified levels. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines the two terms ‚Äì sewage sludge and biosolids ‚Äì in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Part 503 as follows: Sewage sludge refers to the solids separated during the treatment of municipal wastewater (including domestic septage), while biosolids refers to treated sewage sludge that meets the EPA pollutant and pathogen requirements for land application and surface disposal. A similar definition has been used internationally, for example in Australia. Use of the term \\"biosolids\\" may officially be subject to government regulations. However, informal use describes a broad range of semi-solid organic products produced from sewage or sewage sludge. This could include any solids, slime solids or liquid slurry residue generated during the treatment of domestic sewage including scum and solids removed during primary, secondary or advanced treatment processes. Materials that do not conform to the regulatory definition of \\"biosolids\\" can be given alternative terms like \\"wastewater solids\\".  Characteristic  = Quantities = Testing for human pathogens in cereal crops after the application of biosolids.Approximately 7.1 million dry tons of biosolids were generated in 2004 at approximately 16,500 municipal wastewater treatment facilities in the United States. In the United States, as of 2013 about 55% of sewage solids are turned into fertilizer.Cities Turn Sewage Into 'Black Gold' For Local Farms (2013) Challenges faced when increasing the use of biosolids include, the capital needed to build anaerobic digesters and the complexity of complying with health regulations. There are also new concerns about micro-pollutions in sewage (e.g. environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants) which make the process of producing high quality biosolids complex.Smith, S. R. (2009). Organic contaminants in sewage sludge (biosolids) and their significance for agricultural recycling. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 367(1904), 4005-4041 Some municipalities, states or countries have banned the use of biosolids on farmland. = Nutrients = Encouraging agricultural use of biosolids is intended to prevent filling landfills with nutrient-rich organic materials from the treatment of domestic sewage that might be recycled and applied as fertilizer to improve and maintain productive soils and stimulate plant growth. Biosolids can be an ideal agricultural conditioner and fertilizerFrank, R. (1998). The use of biosolids from wastewater treatment plants in agriculture. Environmental Management and Health, 9(4), 165-169. which can help promote crop growth to feed the increasing population. Biosolids may contain macronutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulphur with micronutrients copper, zinc, calcium, magnesium, iron, boron, molybdenum and manganese. = Industrial and man-made contaminants = The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others have shown that biosolids can contain measurable levels of synthetic organic compounds, radionuclides and heavy metals. EPA has set numeric limits for arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and zinc but has not regulated dioxin levels. Contaminants from pharmaceuticals and personal care products and some steroids and hormones may also be present in biosolids. Substantial levels of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) polybrominated diphenyl ethers were detected in biosolids in 2001. The United States Geological Survey analyzed in 2014 nine different consumer products containing biosolids as a main ingredient for 87 organic chemicals found in cleaners, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and other products. These analysis detected 55 of the 87 organic chemicals measured in at least one of the nine biosolid samples, with as many as 45 chemicals found in a single sample. In 2014, the City of Charlotte, North Carolina discovered extreme levels of PCB's in their biosolids after being alerted by that illegal PCB dumping was taking place at regional waste water treatment plants across the state. Biosolids land application in South Carolina was halted in 2013 after an emergency regulation was enacted by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) that outlawed any PCB contaminated biosolids from being land applied regardless if Class A or Class B. Very soon thereafter, SCDHEC expanded PCB fish consumption advisories for nearly every waterway bordering biosolids land application fields. = Pathogens = In the United States the EPA mandates certain treatment processes designed to significantly decrease levels of certain so-called indicator organisms, in biosolids. These include, \\"...operational standards for fecal coliforms, Salmonella sp. bacteria, enteric viruses, and viable helminth ova.\\" However, the US-based Water Environment Research Foundation has shown that some pathogens do survive sewage sludge treatment. EPA regulations allow only biosolids with no detectable pathogens to be widely applied; those with remaining pathogens are restricted in use.  Different types of biosolids  # Anaerobic Digestion: Micro-organisms decompose the sludge in the absence of oxygen either at mesophilic (at 35 ¬∞C) or thermophilic (between 50¬∞ and 57 ¬∞C) temperatures. # Aerobic Digestion: Micro-organisms decompose the sludge in the presence of oxygen either at ambient and mesophilic (10 ¬∞C to 40 ¬∞C) or auto- thermal (40 ¬∞C to 80 ¬∞C) temperatures. # Composting: A biological process where organic matter decomposes to produce humus after the addition of some dry bulking material such as sawdust, wood chips, or shredded yard waste under controlled aerobic conditions. # Alkaline Treatment: The sludge is mixed with alkaline materials such as lime or cement kiln dust, or incinerator fly ash and maintained at pH above 12 for 24 hours (for Class B) or at temperature 70 ¬∞C for 30 minutes (for Class A). # Heat Drying: Either convention or conduction dryers are used to dry the biosolids # Dewatering: The separation of the water from biosolids is done to obtain a semi-solid or solid product by using a dewatering technologies (centrifuges, belt filter presses, plate and frame filter presses, and drying beds and lagoons).  Classification systems  = United States = In the United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Part 503 governs the management of biosolids. Within that federal regulation biosolids are generally classified differently depending upon the quantity of pollutants they contain and the level of treatment they have been subjected to (the latter of which determines both the level of vector attraction reduction and the level of pathogen reduction). These factors also affect how they may be disseminated (bulk or bagged) and the level of monitoring oversight which, in turn determines where and in what quantity they may be applied. =European Union= The European Union (EU) was the first to issue regulations for biosolids land application; this aimed to put a limit to the pathogen and pollution risk.Iranpour, R., Cox, H. H. J., Kearney, R. J., Clark, J. H., Pincince, A. B., & Daigger, G. T. (2004). Regulations for biosolids land application in US and European Union. Journal of Residuals Science & Technology, 1(4), 209-22. These risks come from the fact that some metabolites remain intact after waste water treatment processes.Clarke, R. M., & Cummins, E. (2015). Evaluation of ‚Äúclassic‚Äù and emerging contaminants resulting from the application of biosolids to agricultural lands: A review. Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal, 21(2), 492-513. Debates over biosolid use vary in severity across the EU.Iranpour, R., Cox, H. H. J., Kearney, R. J., Clark, J.

History  As public concern arose about the disposal of increased volumes of solids in the United States being removed from sewage during sewage treatment mandated by the Clean Water Act. The Water Environment Federation (WEF) sought a new name to distinguish the clean, agriculturally viable product generated by modern wastewater treatment from earlier forms of sewage sludge widely remembered for causing offensive or dangerous conditions. Of three-hundred suggestions, biosolids was attributed to Dr. Bruce Logan of the University of Arizona, and recognized by WEF in 1991.

Biography Born in Harlem, New York Jones originally trained to be an advertising designer. He moved to the Netherlands in 1954 with a dance troupe. He was hired by a cabaret company and began a career singing, acting, and dancing. He was hired for the very first Dutch television show, the 1950s television hit ' (written by Annie M.G. Schmidt), in which he played Dinky Henderson, who sings the song \\"Ik zou je het liefste in een doosje willen doen,\\" a Dutch hit and now one of the standards in the musical comedy genre. This made Jones the first black star in the Netherlands. Jones played in many Dutch shows, movies (Grijpstra & De Gier, 1979), and theatrical productions, and in television shows such as ' and Pipo de Clown. Jones was one of the artists who recorded the song Shalom from Holland (written by Simon Hammelburg and Ron Klipstein) as a token of solidarity to the Israeli people, threatened by missiles from Iraq, during the first Gulf War in 1991. =Personal life= He married Dutch bisexual actress Ad√®le Bloemendaal; they were the first well-known mixed couple in the country. Their son, John Jones (born 1963), went on to become an actor and comedian. Death Donald Jones died in Amsterdam of a heart attack on November 5, 2004 at the age of 72.

At the same time, Bishop Stephen Alencastre, Apostolic Vicar of the Sandwich Islands, was the ordinary of what is now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu. An ordinary (from Latin ordinarius) is an officer of a church or civic authority who by reason of office has ordinary power to execute laws. Such officers are found in hierarchically organised churches of Western Christianity which have an ecclesiastical legal system.See, e.g., c. 134 ¬ß 1, Code of Canon Law, 1983 For example, diocesan bishops are ordinaries in the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England.Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (1974) arts. \\"Ordinary\\" and \\"Peculiar\\" In Eastern Christianity, a corresponding officer is called a hierarchc. 984, Code of Canons of the Oriental Churches, 1992 (from Greek hierarkhƒìs \\"president of sacred rites, high-priest\\"·º±ŒµœÅŒ¨œÅœáŒ∑œÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library which comes in turn from œÑ·Ω∞ ·º±ŒµœÅŒ¨ ta hiera, \\"the sacred rites\\" and ·ºÑœÅœáœâ arkh≈ç, \\"I rule\\").\\"hierarchy\\". Online Etymology Dictionary.  Ordinary power  In canon law, the power to govern the church is divided into the power to make laws (legislative), enforce the laws (executive), and to judge based on the law (judicial).c. 135 ¬ß1, Code of Canon Law, 1983 An official exercises power to govern either because he holds an office to which the law grants governing power or because someone with governing power has delegated it to him. Ordinary power is the former, while the latter is delegated power.c. 131 ¬ß1, Code of Canon Law, 1983 The office with ordinary power could possess the governing power itself (proper ordinary power) or instead it could have the ordinary power of agency, the inherent power to exercise someone else's power (vicarious ordinary power).¬ß 2, Code of Canon Law, 1983 The law vesting ordinary power could either be ecclesiastical law, i.e. the positive enactments that the church has established for itself, or divine law, i.e. the laws which the church believes were given to it by God.\\"Ordinary,\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia As an example of divinely instituted ordinaries, Catholics believe that when Jesus established the Church, he also established the episcopate and the primacy of Peter, endowing the offices with power to govern the Church.See Lumen gentium and Pastor aeternus Thus, in the Catholic Church, the office of successor of Simon Peter and the office of diocesan bishop possess their ordinary power even in the absence of positive enactments from the Church. Many officers possess ordinary power but, due to their lack of ordinary executive power, are not called ordinaries. The best example of this phenomenon is the office of judicial vicar, a.k.a. officialis. The judicial vicar only has authority through his office to exercise the diocesan bishop's power to judge cases.c. 1420 ¬ß 1, Code of Canon Law (1983) Though the vicar has vicarious ordinary judicial power, he is not an ordinary because he lacks ordinary executive power. A vicar general, however, has authority through his office to exercise the diocesan bishop's executive power.c. 479 ¬ß 1, Code of Canon Law, 1983 He is therefore an ordinary because of this vicarious ordinary executive power. Catholic usage =Local ordinaries and hierarchs= Local ordinaries exercise ordinary power and are ordinaries in particular churches.c. 134 ¬ß¬ß1‚Äì2, Code of Canon Law, 1983 The following clerics are local ordinaries: *The Bishop of Rome (the pope) is ordinary for the whole Catholic Church.Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 43 and 45 *In Eastern Catholic churches, patriarchs, major archbishops, and metropolitans have ordinary power of governance for the whole territory of their respective autonomous particular churches.Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 78, 152 and 157 *Diocesan/eparchial bishops/eparchs *Other prelates who head, even if only temporarily, a particular church or a community equivalent to it. Canon 368 of the Code of Canon Law lists five Latin-rite jurisdictional areas that are considered equivalent to a diocese.Code of Canon Law, canon 368 These are headed by: **A territorial prelature, formerly called a prelate nullius dioceseos (of no diocese), in charge of a geographical area that has not yet been raised to the level of diocese **A territorial abbey, in charge of an area, which in mission countries can be quite vast, associated with an abbey **An apostolic vicar (normally a bishop of a titular see), in charge of an apostolic vicariate, usually in a mission country, not yet ready to be made a diocese **An apostolic prefect (usually not a bishop), in charge of an apostolic prefecture, not yet ready to be made an apostolic vicariate **A permanent apostolic administrator, in charge of a geographical area that for serious reasons cannot be made a diocese. *To these may be added: **An apostolic exarch (normally a bishop of a titular see), in charge of an apostolic exarchate‚Äînot yet ready to be made an eparchy‚Äîfor the faithful of an Eastern Catholic Church in an area that is situated outside the home territory of that Eastern Church **A military ordinariate **A personal prelate, in charge of a group of persons without regard to geography: the only personal prelature existing is that of Opus Dei **An apostolic administrator of a personal apostolic administration: only one exists, the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney **An ordinary of a personal ordinariate for former AnglicansApostolic Constitution Anglicanorum coetibus of 4 November 2009 **A superior of an autonomous mission *Of somewhat similar standing is the diocesan administrator (formerly called a vicar capitular) elected to govern a diocese during a vacancy. Apart from certain limitations of nature and law, he has, on a caretaker basis, the same obligations and powers as a diocesan bishop.Code of Canon Law, canons 427‚Äì429 Occasionally an apostolic administrator is appointed by the Holy See to run a vacant diocese, or even a diocese whose bishop is incapacitated or otherwise impeded. Also classified as local ordinaries, although they do not head a particular church or equivalent community are: *Vicars general and protosyncelli *Episcopal vicars and syncelli =Ordinaries who are not local ordinaries= Major superiors of religious institutes (including abbots) and of societies of apostolic life are ordinaries of their respective memberships, but not local ordinaries.Code of Canon Law, canon 134 Orthodox Christianity In the Orthodox Church, a hierarch (ruling bishop) holds uncontested authority within the boundaries of his own diocese; no other bishop may perform any sacerdotal functions without the ruling bishop's express invitation. The violation of this rule is called eispƒìdƒìsis (Greek: Œµ·º∞œÉœÄŒÆŒ¥Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ, \\"trespassing\\", literally \\"jumping in\\"), and is uncanonical. Ultimately, all bishops in the Church are equal, regardless of any title they may enjoy (Patriarch, Metropolitan, Archbishop, etc.). The role of the bishop in the Orthodox Church is both hierarchical and sacramental. This pattern of governance dates back to the earliest centuries of Christianity, as witnessed by the writings of Ignatius of Antioch (ca. 100 AD): > The bishop in each Church presides in the place of God.... Let no one do any > of the things which concern the Church without the bishop.... Wherever the > bishop appears, there let the people be, just as wherever Jesus Christ is, > there is the Catholic Church. And it is the bishop's primary and distinctive task to celebrate the Eucharist, \\"the medicine of immortality.\\"Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to the Magnesians, VI:1; Epistle to the Smyrneans, VIII:1 and 2; Epistle to the Ephesians, XX:2. Saint Cyprian of Carthage (258 AD) wrote: > The episcopate is a single whole, in which each bishop enjoys full > possession. So is the Church a single whole, though it spreads far and wide > into a multitude of churches and its fertility increases.Cyprian of > Carthage, On the Unity of the Church, V. Bishop Kallistos (Ware) wrote: > There are many churches, but only One Church; many episcopi but only one > episcopate.\\" In Orthodox Christianity, the church is not seen as a monolithic, centralized institution, but rather as existing in its fullness in each local body. The church is defined Eucharistically: > in each particular community gathered around its bishop; and at every local > celebration of the Eucharist it is the whole Christ who is present, not just > a part of Him. Therefore, each local community, as it celebrates the > Eucharist ... is the church in its fullness.\\" This is not to say that the Orthodox Church has a Congregationalist polity; on the contrary, the local priest functions as the \\"hands\\" of the bishop, and must receive from the bishop an antimension and chrism before he is permitted to celebrate any of the Sacred Mysteries (sacraments) within the diocese. An Orthodox bishop's authority comes from his election and consecration. He is, however, subject to the Sacred Canons of the Orthodox Church, and answers to the Synod of Bishops to which he belongs. In case an Orthodox bishop is overruled by his local synod, he retains the right of appeal (Greek: ·ºúŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÑŒøŒΩ, √âkklƒìton) to his ecclesiastical superior (e.g. a Patriarch) and his synod.

The economy of Busto Arsizio is mainly based on industry and commerce. It is the fifth municipality in the region by population and the first in the province. History Despite some claims about a Celtic heritage, recent studies suggest that the \\"Bustocchis ancestors were Ligurians, called \\"wild\\" by Pliny, \\"marauders and robbers\\" by Livy and \\"unshaven and hairy\\" by Pompeius Tragus. They were skilled iron workers and much sought after as mercenary soldiers. A remote Ligurian influence is perceptible in the local dialect, B√ºst√≥cu, slightly different from other Western Lombard varieties, according to local expert and historian Luigi Giavini.Altro che celti. Sono liguri gli avi dei Bustocchi Varesenews, November 21, 2002 Traditionally these first inhabitants used to set fire to woods made of old and young oaks and black hornbeams, which at that time, covered the whole Padan Plain. This slash-and-burn practice, known as \\"debbio\\" in Italian, aimed to create fields where grapevines or cereals such as foxtail, millet and rye were grown, or just to create open spaces where stone huts with thatched roofs were built. By doing this, they created a bustum (burnt, in Latin), that is a new settlement which, in order to be distinguished from the other nearby settlements, was assigned a name: arsicium (again \\"burnt\\", or better \\"arid\\") for Busto Arsizio, whose name is actually a tautology; carulf√¨ for nearby Busto Garolfo, cava for Busto Cava, later Buscate. The slow increase in population was helped by the Insubres, a Gaulish tribe who arrived in successive waves by crossing the Alps c. 500 BCE. It is said that they defeated the Etruscans, who by then controlled the area, leaving some geographical names behind (Arno creek (not to be confused with Florence's river), Castronno, Caronno, Biandronno, etc.). Busto Arsizio was created on the route between Milan and Lake Maggiore (called \\"Milan‚Äôs road\\", an alternative route to the existent Sempione), part of which, before the creation of the Naviglio Grande, made use of the navigational water of the Ticino river. However, nothing is clearly known about Busto Arsizio's history before the 10th century, when the town's name was first discovered in documents, already with its present name: loco Busti qui dicitur Arsizio. A part of the powerful Contado of the Seprio, in 1176, its citizens likely participated (on both sides) in the famous Battle of Legnano, actually fought between Busto Arsizio's frazione of Borsano and nearby Villa Cortese, when Frederick Barbarossa was defeated by the communal militia of the Lombard League. From the 13th century the town became renowned for its production of textiles. Even its feudalization in later centuries under several lords, vassals of the masters of Milan, did not stop its slow but constant growth; nor did the plague, which hit hard in 1630, traditionally being stopped by the Virgin Mary after the Bustocchi, always a pious Catholic flock, prayed for respite from the deadly epidemic. By the mid-19th century, modern industry began to take over strongly; in a few decades, Busto Arsizio became the so- called \\"Manchester of Italy\\". In 1864, while the \\"Bustocco\\" Eugenio Tosi was the Archbishop of Milan, it was granted city privileges by king Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. The city continued to grow over the next century, absorbing the nearby comuni of Borsano and Sacconago in 1927 in a major administrative reform implemented by the Fascist regime, and was only marginally damaged even by World War II (a single Allied airdropped bomb is said to have hit the train station). This respite was given, actually, by the fact that the town hosted the important Allied liaison mission with the partisans, the Chrysler mission, led by Lt. Aldo Icardi, later famous for his involvement in the Holohan Murder Case. During the conflict, Busto Arsizio was a major industrial center for war production, and the occupying Germans moved there the Italian national radio. The Italian resistance movement resorted preferably to strikes and sabotage than to overt guerrilla warfare, since those willing to fight mostly took to the Ossola mountains, but strengthened in time, suffering grievous losses to arrests, tortures and deportation to the Nazi lager system. The names of Mauthausen-Gusen and Flossenburg concentration and extermination camps are sadly known to the Bustocchi, as dozens of their fellow citizens died there. On 25 April 1945, when the partisans took over, Busto Arsizio gave voice to the first free radio channel in northern Italy since the advent of Fascism. After the war, the city turned increasingly on the right of the political spectrum as its bigger industries in the 1960s and 1970s decayed, to be replaced by many familiar small enterprises and a new service-based economy. Today, the town represents a major stronghold for both Forza Italia and Lega Nord right-wing political parties.

In Busto Arsizio there are several of them, built in the last millennium. Many of them are reconstructions of former churches. =Shrine of Santa Maria di Piazza= The most remarkable building of the Renaissance period, indeed the only remaining, is the shrine of Santa Maria di Piazza (\\"Saint Mary of the Square\\"), also called shrine of the Beata Vergine dell'Aiuto (\\"Blessed Virgin of the Help\\"). The building stands in the city centre. It was built between 1515 and 1522. The village of Crespi d'Adda, built up for Cristoforo Benigno Crespi, is home to a smaller version of the shrine. =Saint John the Baptist's church= Paintings in Saint John the Baptist church. The church of Saint John the Baptist, in the city center, was built between 1609 and 1635 by Francesco Maria Ricchini, but the bell tower is older (between 1400 and 1418). The fa√ßade, finished in 1701 by Domenico Valmagini, has many statues and decorations. In the interior are numerous of paintings by Daniele Crespi, a celebrated painter born at Busto Arsizio, such as Cristo morto con San Domenico and Biagio Bellotti. The square in front of this church was built over the ancient cemetery. =Saint Michael Archangel's church= Saint Michael Archangel. The third biggest church in the city is the Church of Saint Michael Archangel (San Michele Arcangelo). Its bell tower, built in the 10th century, is the oldest building in Busto Arsizio; originally it was part of a Lombard fortification. The present church was built by the architect Francesco Maria Richini. In the church there are some relics, the most important of which is the body of San Felice Martire. =Saint Roch's church= Built up after the 1485 bubonic plague and dedicated to Saint Roch, invoked against the plague, it was rebuilt from 1706 to 1713 thanks to offerings made by the lawyer Carlo Visconti. Inside the church there are frescos by Salvatore and Francesco Maria Bianchi (1731) and Biagio Bellotti. =Museum of Textiles and Industry= The Museum of Textiles and Industry was officially inaugurated in 1997 after years of restoration, and its collections are representative of Busto's economical history. They explain how the city developed from a small agricultural village to a thriving, industrial center of manufacturing and commerce in a few decades. Traditional festivals Gi√∂bia. The patron saints of the city are Saint John the Baptist and Saint Michael Archangel, whose feasts are traditionally celebrated on 24 June and 29 September. In recent times the town council has given also civic relevance to celebrations that up to now were almost completely of a religious kind. During winter it is an established tradition since time immemorial the burning of the Gi√∂bia (historical spelling: Gioeubia), a (usually) female puppet, symbolizing the \\"chasing\\" out of winter and its troubles, and on a more sinister note, the change from a matriarchal to a patriarchal society in ancient times. Time ago each family prepared its simple puppet to be burnt, and then its ashes were dispersed to fertilize the fields as good omen.La Gi√∂bia dai Liguri antichi al Duemila Varesenews, January 25, 2007 Now the celebration is more organized and publicly supported, but still heartily felt by the populace. Busto Arsizio has two carnival masks, called Tarlisu and Bumbasina from the name of some typical textiles. Carnival in Busto Arsizio. Music Mina, an Italian pop star was born in Busto Arsizio. Italian violinist and conductor Uto Ughi was also born and is currently living in the city. Sport Pro Patria. Busto Arsizio is the host for the Federazione Italiana Sport Croquet, the lawns being located at the \\"Cascina del Lupo\\" Sporting Centre just outside the town. Pro Patria Calcio football club plays in Busto Arsizio (at the Carlo Speroni Stadium). Pro Patria A.R.C. Busto Arsizio is the athletic society. Yamamay Busto Arsizio is the main volleyball society of the city and plays in the first national division. One of the most important athletes of Busto Arsizio is Umberto Pelizzari, born on August 28, 1965, widely considered among the best freedivers of all times. Other important athletes are the former twirling world champion Chiara Stefanazzi, the former footballers Carlo Reguzzoni, Antonio Azimonti, Aldo Marelli, Egidio Calloni, Natale Masera and Michele Ferri.

College career Andruzzi played college football at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he majored in special education. He played every position on the offensive line and started all four years. Andruzzi was a Division II All-American his junior and senior years as well as an offensive team captain during his senior season. Andruzzi played high school football at Tottenville High School in his hometown of Staten Island, New York City, New York. He was a classmate of Major League baseball All Star starting pitcher Jason Marquis,a teammate of Adewale Ogunleye, defensive end for the Miami Dolphins and then the Chicago Bears and also Ed Lozada(AE Stevenson HS in the Bronx, NY), Semi-Pro football Hall of Fame inductee and member of the five time champion NY Bandits(USFL). Professional career In 1997, Andruzzi was picked up as an undrafted rookie free agent by the Green Bay Packers. He was allocated by the Packers in February 1998 to play football in Scotland for NFL Europe. Andruzzi was released from the Packers after three seasons. He was then signed by the New England Patriots in 2000, where he played five seasons and earned three Super Bowl rings. In recognition of his contributions, Andruzzi received the Ed Block Courage Award in 2002 and the first Ron Burton Community Service Award in 2003. Andruzzi became a free agent in February 2005 and was signed by the Cleveland Browns. He played with them for two seasons. Cancer experience and charitable mission In 2001, Andruzzi and his wife, Jen, were introduced to C.J. Buckley, who had an inoperable brain tumor. The families became very close and, therefore, it was devastating when C.J. died late in 2002. Always driven to help others in need, the couple launched the C.J. Buckley Brain Cancer Research Fund at Children's Hospital. On May 30, 2007, Andruzzi was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's Burkitt's lymphoma, predicted to double in size in just 24 hours. The family relocated back to New England where Andruzzi had an aggressive form of chemotherapy treatment over three months at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Andruzzi's last treatment was on August 6, 2007 after which he spent the following year at home in recovery. After completing treatment, the Andruzzi family founded the Joe Andruzzi Foundation in 2008. They are committed to tackling cancer's impact by providing financial assistance for patients and their families as well as funding pediatric brain cancer research. Andruzzi received the 2015 Man of the Year award from the Walter Camp Football Foundation. Personal life Andruzzi has three brothers. All three are members of the New York City Fire Department, and responded to the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. During pregame introductions at the next game on September 23, Andruzzi ran out with an American flag in each hand. His brothers were honored at midfield prior to kickoff. On April 15, 2013, Andruzzi's foundation was hosting an event at a business on Boylston Street in Boston when the Boston Marathon bombing occurred. In the aftermath, he was photographed carrying an injured woman. Andruzzi's friend, former Patriots linebacker Matt Chatham, was also present, and uninjured.

The appeal is first referenced in Gildas' 6th-century De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae; Gildas' account was later repeated in Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum. According to Gildas, the message was addressed to the general Flavius Aetius. The collapsing Western Roman Empire had few military resources to spare during its decline, and the record is ambiguous on what the response to the appeal was, if any. According to Gildas and various later medieval sources, the failure of the Roman armies to secure Britain led the Britons to invite Anglo-Saxon mercenaries to the island, precipitating the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. Message The message is recorded by Gildas in his De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, written in the second quarter of the sixth century and much later repeated by Bede. According to these sources, it was a last-ditch plea to \\"Agitius\\" for assistance. Agitius is generally identified as Aetius, of the Western Roman Empire who spent most of the 440s fighting insurgents in Gaul and Hispania. The Roman Britons had been beset by raids by the Picts and Scots from northern Britain, who were able to pillage far to the south after the Roman armies had withdrawn from the island in 407. The text describes Agitius as being consul for the third time, dating the message to the period between 446, when he held his third consulate, and 454, when he held his fourth.In Michael Lapidge and David Dumville, eds. Gildas: New Approaches (Studies in Celtic History 5) 1984. Leslie Alcock has raised a tentative possibility of the \\"Agitius\\" to whom the gemitus is directed actually being Aegidius‚Äîthough he was never consul.Alcock, Arthur's Britain, 1971:107: \\"Agitius is most reasonably identified with Aegidius... but Aegidius was never a consul.\\" Alcock 1971 was critically reviewed by K. H. Jackson in Antiquity 47 (1973), noted by Thomas D. O'Sullivan, The De Excidio of Gildas :169 and notes. Aside from Miller,Miller, \\"Bede's use of Gildas,\\" English Historical Review 90 (1975:247). who leaves the possibility open, this alternative has not been pursued. The usurper Constantine III had taken the last Roman troops from Britain in 407 and the civilian administration had been expelled by the natives a little later, leaving the inhabitants to fend for themselves during increasingly fraught times. Parts of the plea were recorded:\\"The Works of Gildas, Surnamed 'Sapiens,' or the Wise\\", in: John Allen Giles, ed., Six Old English Chronicles, of Which Two Are Now First Translated from the Monkish Latin Originals (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1848), pt. 1, ¬∂20. This is a revision of Thomas Habington, trans., The Epistle of Gildas the most ancient British Author: who flourished in the yeere of our Lord, 546. And who by his great erudition, sanctitie, and wisdome, acquired the name of Sapiens. Faithfully translated out of the originall Latine, 8 vols. (London: T. Cotes for William Cooke, 1638). The Romans, however, could not assist them, so the Britons were left to their own devices. Problems of interpretation A second visit in around 446‚Äì7 by Germanus, a former Roman general who had become Bishop of Auxerre, recorded in his Vita by Constantius of Lyon,E. A. Thompson, ed. The De Excidio of Gildas could have reflected Aetius' response to the message. The reference to Aetius' third consulship (446) is useful in dating the increasing strife in Britain during this period. Gildas' mention of the appeal is a minor part of a much larger religious polemic, however, which means that the image described may be more hyperbolic than realistic, especially as his sources were probably derived from oral tradition. The traditional picture of Romano- British society in post-Roman Britain as besieged and chaotic is also being increasingly challenged by archaeological evidence. The viewpoint of Gildas is coloured by his classicizing rather than monastic education, based at some remove on the Roman education of a rhetor, a source of his elaborated and difficult Latin.Michael Lapidge, \\"Gildas' education and the Latin culture of sub-Roman Britain', in Lapidge and Dumville 1984. Gildas' narrative describes the Britons as being too impious and plagued by infighting to fend off the Picts and Scots. They managed some successes against the invaders when they placed their faith in God's hands, but they were usually left to suffer greatly. Gildas mentions a \\"proud tyrant\\" who Bede names as Vortigern as the person who originally invited Germanic mercenaries to defend the borders, but the identification of this actual historical person has not yet established, so the actual dating of the start of Saxon foederati presence in Britain is still contentious. Archaeology increasingly confirms Germanic presence before the Romans withdrew. Archaeological evidence supports some Germanic communities being in place in England before the 440s. The rebellion of Carausius in late 286 or early 287 and his recruitment of Frisian and Frankish foederati to man the Saxon Shore, for example, fits the myth of Vortigen quite well, including his betrayal and death. If it is true that Saxons were foederati allied with the Romano-British who stayed when the legions left, then the Battle of Badon Hill may have actually been fought in the northwest of England between Scots invaders from Ireland and British-Saxon defenders. Gildas' metaphors of collapse also need to be interpreted in the context of the Justinianic plague, which halved the population of Europe around 550 CE, the time he was writing. Metaphors commonly interpreted to mean invading Saxons could actually be referring to plague sweeping across the land. What is clear, is that ultimately, there was an increasing Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries and increasing Anglo-Saxon culture, including language.

Etymology The name Onoƒüur is most often derived as On-Oƒüur \\"ten Oƒüurs (tribes)\\". Modern scholars consider Turkic tribal terms oƒüuz and oƒüur to be derived from Turkic *og/uq, meaning \\"kinship or being akin to\\". The terms initially were not the same, as oq/ogsiz meant \\"arrow\\", while oƒüul meant \\"offspring, child, son\\", oƒüu≈°/uƒüu≈° was \\"tribe, clan\\", and the verb oƒü≈°a-/oq≈°a meant \\"to be like, resemble\\". The ethnonym Hungarian is derived from Onogurs (> (H)ungars). History The Onogurs were one of the first Oghuric Turkic tribes that entered the Ponto-Caspian steppes as the result of migrations set off in Inner Asia. The 10th century Movses Kaghankatvatsi recorded, considered late 4th century, certain Honagur, \\"a Hun from the Honk\\" who raided Persia, which were related to the Onoghurs, and located near Transcaucasia and the Sassanian Empire. Scholars also relate the Hy≈çn to this account. According to Priscus, in 463 the representatives of Ernak's Saraghurs (Oghur. sara, \\"White Oghurs\\"), Oghurs and Onoghurs came to the Emperor in Constantinople, and explained they had been driven out of their homeland by the Sabirs, who had been attacked by the Avars in Inner Asia. This tangle of events indicates that the Oghuric tribes are related to the Ting-ling and Tiele people. It is considered they belonged to the westernmost Tiele tribes, which also included the Uyghurs-Toquz Oghuz and the Oghuz Turks, and were initially located in Western Siberia and Kazakhstan. Leo I the Thracian granted Ernak the lands of the treacherous Karadach's Akatziroi roughly corresponding to 20th century Ukraine. Later kings of the Onogur Huns included Grod, Mugel and Sandilch whose Utigurs were engaged in a civil war against the Kutrigurs of Khinialon. The origin of the Kutrigurs and Utigurs, who lived in the vicinity of the Onoghurs and Bulgars, and their mutual relationship is considered obscure. Scholars consider unclear how the union between Onoghurs and Bulgars formed, viewing it as a long process in which a number of different groups merged. During that time, the Bulgars may have represented a large confederation of which the Onoghurs formed one of the core tribes, together with the remnants of the Utigurs and Kutrigurs, among others. Jordanes in Getica (551) mentioned that the Hunuguri (believed to be the Onoghurs) were notable for the marten skin trade. In the Middle Ages, marten skin was used as a substitute for minted money. This also indicates they lived near forests and were in contact with Finno-Ugrian peoples. The Syriac translation of the Pseudo‚ÄìZacharias Rhetor's Ecclesiastical History (c. 555) in Western Eurasia records the Avnagur (Aunagur; considered Onoghurs), wngwr (Onoƒüur), wgr (Oghur), described in typical phrases reserved for nomads in the ethnographic literature of the period, as people who \\"live in tents, earn their living on the meat of livestock and fish, of wild animals and by their weapons (plunder)\\". The Onoghurs (Oghurs), in the 6th and 7th century sources, were mentioned mostly in connection with the Avar and G√∂kt√ºrk conquest of Western Eurasia. According to the 6th century Menander Protector, the \\"leader of the Œü·ΩêŒ≥ŒøœçœÅœâŒΩ\\" had the authority of the Turk Yabgu Khagan in the region of Kuban River to the lower Don. In early 7th century Theophylaktos Simokattes recorded that certain Onoghur city ŒíŒ±Œ∫Œ¨Œ∏ was destroyed by an earthquake before his lifetime. The Sogdian name indicates it was situated in the vicinity of Iranian Central Asia. Simokattes in the Letter of the Turk QaŒ≥an (Tamgan) to the Emperor Maurikios recorded a complex notice: > \\"...the Qaghan set off on another undertaking and subjugated all the ·ΩàŒ≥œéœÅ. > This people is (one) of the most powerful because of their numbers and their > training for war in full battle-gear. They have made their abodes towards > the East, whence flows the river Œ§ŒØŒª, which the Turks have the custom of > calling the \\"Black\\". The oldest chieftains of this people are called Œü·ΩêŒ¨œÅ > and ŒßŒøœÖŒΩŒΩŒØ.\\" According to the Qaghan, part of those Ouar (Uar) and Khounni (Huns) who arrived to Eastern Europe were mistook by the Onoghurs, Barsils, Sabirs and other tribes for the original Avars, and as such the Uar and Huns took advantage of the situation and began call themselves Avars. Simokattes also recounts \\"when the Ogor, then, were brought completely to heel, the QaŒ≥an gave over the chief of the Œö·Ω∏Œªœá (Kolx) to the bite of the sword\\", shows Oghurs resistance toward Turkic authority. Scholars consider if the Til is Qara Itil (Black Itil) i.e. Volga (Atil/Itil), then the mentioned ·ΩàŒ≥œéœÅ would be the Oghurs, while if it is in Inner Asia, then it could be the Uyghurs. =Old Bulgaria= Kubrat organised the Onogurs under his Empire of Old Great Bulgaria in the Mid 7th century. From the 8th century, the Byzantine sources often mention the Onoghurs in close connection with the Bulgars. Agathon (early 8th century) wrote about the nation of Onoghur Bulgars. Nikephoros I (early 9th century) noted that Kubrat was the lord of the Onoghundurs; his contemporary Theophanes referred to them as Onoghundur‚ÄìBulgars. Kubrat successfully revolted against the Avars and founded the Old Great Bulgaria (Magna Bulgaria), also known as Onoghundur‚ÄìBulgars state, or Patria Onoguria in the Ravenna Cosmography. Constantine VII (mid-10th century) remarked that the Bulgars formerly called themselves Onogundurs. This association was previously mirrored in Armenian sources, such as the Ashkharatsuyts, which refers to the Olxontor B≈Çkar, and the 5th century History by Movses Khorenatsi, which includes an additional comment from a 9th-century writer about the colony of the V≈Çƒïndur Bu≈Çkar. Marquart and Golden connected these forms with the Iƒ°ndr (*Uluƒ°undur) of Ibn al-Kalbi (c. 820), the Vnndur (*Wunundur) of Hudud al-'Alam (982), the Wlndr (*Wulundur) of Al-Masudi (10th century) and Hungarian name for Belgrad N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r, the nndr (*Nandur) of Gardƒ´zƒ´ (11th century) and *Wununtur in the letter by the Khazar King Joseph.

With a maximum speed of , the line appreciably shortened rail journeys between Paris and Lille. Its extensions to the north (Belgium, the Channel Tunnel) and the south (via the LGV Interconnexion Est) have reduced journey times to Great Britain and Benelux and for inter-regional trips between the Nord (Pas de Calais) region and the southeast and southwest of France. Its route is twinned with the A1 for . As it is mostly built in flat areas, the maximum incline is 25 metres per kilometre (2.5‚Ä∞). Of all French high-speed lines the LGV Nord sees the widest variety of high-speed rolling stock: the TGV POS, TGV R√©seau, TGV Atlantique, TGV Duplex, Eurostar e300, Eurostar e320, Thalys PBA and PBKA as well as the local trains. Traffic is controlled by the Lille rail traffic centre. Route The LGV Nord begins at Arnouville-l√®s-Gonesse, from the Gare du Nord on the Paris‚ÄìLille railway line. At V√©mars, the LGV Interconnexion Est joins it via a triangular junction, leading to Charles de Gaulle Airport and Marne-la-Vall√©e-Chessy; this enables direct trains from London and Amsterdam to Disneyland Paris, as well as the southern destinations (Lyon, Avignon and Marseille) After passing east of the forest of Ermenonville over the viaduc de Verberie, it joins the A1 around Chevri√®res and accompanies it to the Lille suburbs. At Ablaincourt- Pressoir (Somme), a new station, Gare TGV Haute-Picardie, is served only by inter-regional TGVs. At Croisilles, Pas-de-Calais, a junction leads to the Agny link towards Arras. The LGV crosses the A1 autoroute at Seclin (Nord). Fretin triangle flying junction At Fretin, a triangular junction links the LGV to the Lille-Brussels HSL 1 high-speed line eastwards, crossing the border at Wannehain and joining the conventional network at Lembeek, south of Brussels. After the Fretin junction, the LGV has a connection to the conventional network at Lezennes, near Lille. This junction is used for TGVs terminating at Lille, which use Lille-Flandres. TGVs that continue beyond Lille, as well as some Eurostar services, stop at Lille-Europe instead. Non-stop Eurostars pass through a tunnel under the city of Lille at . The line passes south of Armenti√®res and north of Hazebrouck. At Cassel, a link provides a connection with Dunkirk. The LGV continues west, crossing the A26 autoroute at Zouafques and ends at Calais-Fr√©thun, at the Eurotunnel terminal. This enables TGV service to Calais and Eurostars through the Channel Tunnel to London. The TGVs continue to Calais-Ville or reverse in either Calais stations and go on to Boulogne-sur-Mer and √âtaples-Le Touquet and Rang-du-Fliers-Verton. The route was much criticised, particularly by those in the Picardy region. The LGV crosses the region without a stop; Amiens in particular would have liked to have been on the line. The government judged a route via Amiens to be impracticable, as the Lille route demanded a straight line between Paris and Lille in order to give a reasonable Paris-Lille-London journey time. The LGV Picardie project would address this issue by serving Amiens, and would reduce the Paris‚ÄìLondon journey time to less than 2 hours. Stations The LGV Nord serves the following stations: * Gare du Nord (Paris) * Gare TGV Haute- Picardie1 * Gare d'Arras¬≤ * Gare de Lille-Europe * Gare de Calais-Fr√©thun 1 Haute-Picardie station has been nicknamed \\"Gare des Betteraves\\" or \\"Beetroot Station,\\" since it is located in the middle of nowhere and is only accessible by good road connections. Amiens wanted a station closer to the town centre, stopping at Gare d'Amiens. ¬≤ Arras station is reached via a branch of the LGV Nord that splits off near the village of Croisilles. History   * The line was designed to facilitate European connections. The foreseen opening of the Channel Tunnel made it a project of the utmost urgency, leading to an acceleration of work.

Other proposals are yet to be formalised. Deutsche Bahn A Deutsche Bahn high-speed train In 2009, Eurotunnel (the owners of the Channel Tunnel) announced that it was prepared to start relaxing the fire safety regulations, in order to permit other operators, such as Deutsche Bahn, to transport passengers via the Tunnel using other forms of rolling stock via LGV Nord. Under the deregulation of European railway service, high-speed lines were opened up to open access on 1 January 2010; the Inter-Governmental Commission on the Channel Tunnel (IGC) announced that it was considering relaxing the safety requirements concerning train splitting. LCR suggested that high-speed rail services between London and Cologne could commence before the 2012 Olympics. As of March 2010 Eurotunnel, High Speed 1, DB and other interested train operators formed a working group to discuss changes to the safety rules, including allowing DB's trains through the tunnel on a Frankfurt to London service. Deutsche Bahn hope to run an ICE 3 train through the Channel Tunnel on 19 October 2010, in preparation for possible future operations. The current Velaro ICE3 sets do not meet the fire safety requirements necessary for the carriage of passengers through the Channel Tunnel, but the Siemens Velaro D sets on order include the necessary additional fire-proofing. DB are considering a Frankfurt to London service which could start in 2020 taking about 4 to 5 hours with stops at Cologne and Brussels. The ICE 4 trains that are planned to be used on the route are yet to be given their permit to travel at speed through northern France and Belgium, increasing the time it will take for this service to come in fruition, but DB now allegedly plan to start a dual service. This would entail the use of two ICE 4 trains tethered together, travelling as far as Brussels Midi, before splitting, where one train will carry on to Amsterdam via Rotterdam and the other to Frankfurt via Cologne. Auf Wiedersehen jet: London to Frankfurt by train, The Guardian (19 September 2010) Veolia AGV train would cut journey times to London In September 2008, Air France-KLM indicated a desire to take advantage of the change in the law and apply to run rail services.

Balance shafts are used in piston engines to reduce vibration by cancelling out unbalanced dynamic forces. The balance shafts have eccentric weights and rotate in opposite direction to each other, which generates a net vertical force. The balance shaft was invented and patented by British engineer Frederick W. Lanchester in 1904. It is most commonly used in inline-four and V6 engines used in automobiles and motorcycles. Overview Lanchester's vertical force balancer. The eccentric masses are labelled \\"C\\" and \\"D\\". The operating principle of a balance shaft system is that two shafts carrying identical eccentric weights rotate in opposite directions at twice the engine speed. The phasing of the shafts is such that the centrifugal forces produced by the weights cancel the vertical second-order forces (at twice the engine RPM) produced by the engine. The horizontal forces produced by the balance shafts are equal and opposite, and so cancel each other. The balance shafts do not reduce the vibrations experienced by the crankshaft. Applications = Two-cylinder engines = Numerous motorcycle engines‚Äî particularly straight-twin engines‚Äî have employed balance shaft systems, for example the Yamaha TRX850 and Yamaha TDM850 engines have a 270¬∞ crankshaft with a balance shaft. An alternative approach, as used by the BMW GS parallel-twin, is to use a 'dummy' connecting rod which moves a hinged counterweight. = Four-cylinder engines = Valve timing gears on a Ford Taunus V4 engine. The balance shaft runs off the small gear on the left (the large gear is for the camshaft, causing it to rotate at half the speed of the crankshaft). Balance shafts are often used in inline-four engines, to reduce the second-order vibration (a vertical force oscillating at twice the engine RPM) that is inherent in the design of a typical inline-four engine. This vibration is generated because the movement of the connecting rods in an even-firing inline-four engine is not symmetrical throughout the crankshaft rotation; thus during a given period of crankshaft rotation, the descending and ascending pistons are not always completely opposed in their acceleration, giving rise to a net vertical force twice in each revolution (which increases quadratically with RPM).\\"Shaking forces of twin engines\\", Vittore Cossalter, Dinamoto.it The amount of vibration also increases with engine displacement, resulting in balance shafts often being used in inline-four engines with displacements of or more. Both an increased stroke or bore cause an increased secondary vibration; a larger stroke increases the difference in acceleration and a larger bore increases the mass of the pistons. The Lanchester design of balance shaft systems was refined with the Mitsubishi Astron 80, an inline- four car engine introduced in 1975. This engine was the first to locate one balance shaft higher than the other, to counteract the second order rolling couple (i.e. about the crankshaft axis) due to the torque exerted by the inertia caused by increases and decreases in engine speed. In a flat-four engine, the forces are cancelled out by the pistons moving in opposite directions. Therefore balance shafts are not needed in flat-four engines. = Five-cylinder engines = Balance shaft are also used in Straight-five engines such as GM Vortec 3700. = Six-cylinder engines = In a straight-six engine and flat-six engine, the rocking forces are naturally balanced out, therefore balance shafts are not required. V6 engines are inherently unbalanced, regardless of the V-angle. Any inline engine with an odd number of cylinders has a primary imbalance, which causes an end-to-end rocking motion. As each cylinder bank in a V6 has three cylinders, each cylinder bank experiences this motion. Balance shaft(s) are used on various V6 engines to reduce this rocking motion.

Elafius is the name used by Bede, however, the best texts of Constantius of Lyon record the name as Elaphus and Elafus.Grosjean, P., Analecta Bollandiana, 1957. Hagiographie Celtique pp. 158‚Äì226.Nicholl, D. (1958) Celts, Romans and Saxons, Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, Vol. 47, No. 187 (Autumn, 1958), p. 300Breeze, A (2002) ELAPHUS THE BRITON, St GERMANUS, AND BEDE in The Journal of Theological Studies, NEW SERIES, Vol. 53, No. 2 (OCTOBER 2002),pp. 554-557, Published by: Oxford University Press, p. 556. He is the only named British figure (apart from the martyr-saint Alban) in the Vita Germani (Life of Saint Germanus), written by Constantius of Lyon in the mid to late 5th century, which describes two visits to Britain by bishop Germanus of Auxerre. According to Constantius during Germanus's second visit to Britain (perhaps in c. AD 446-7) he met Elafius and miraculously cured his crippled son. This act served to demonstrate to the Britons that Catholicism was the true faith rather than Pelagianism. Elafius is mentioned as being regionis illius primus' or 'leader of that region' in chapters 26 and 27 of Constantius of Lyon's hagiography of Germanus and also in Chapter XXI of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of England. Both sources mention that provincia tota or 'the whole province' followed him to witness the cure. This description can be taken to mean that Elafius was one of a number of local warlords rather than leader of all post-Roman Britain and might provide a small insight into the political situation in the area at the time. By means of comparison, a Briton Germanus is recorded as having met seventeen years earlier, in 429, is described by Constantius as being of tribunician rank. This remnant Roman term and the Romanised society it represents may therefore have been abandoned by Elafius' time as he is accorded no such title. On the other hand there may be little significance in the term if it is just being used as a general term for a civil official, while the fact that Elafius was a local leader need not necessarily imply he had the character of a 'warlord' or that there was not someone who was regarded as the dominant leader of the entire ex-province at the time (something, however, we can hardly know, one way or the other). One might speculate that Elafius' court, or place of residence, may have been at St Albans, the former Roman city of Verulamium, since that was very probably the cult centre for Saint Alban, visited by Germanus on his first visit to Britain - or alternatively some other ex-Roman city of Southern Britain. If Elafius was a leader he may have played a role in the subsequent exile of the Pelagian preachers although this banishment is described as being decided through common consent rather than a warlord's orders or even a Roman legal process. Elafius is a name of Greek origin (elaphos='deer') which in this period was best recorded from the South of Gaul.p. 144 in Mathisen, Ralph. W. (1999) \\"Ruricius of Limoges and Friends\\", Liverpool University Press. Doubtful historicity The Vita Germani is not a historical source that we can necessarily trust in every detail. Nora K. Chadwick Chadwick, Nora (1955) Poetry and Letters in Early Christian Gaul, London quoted Constantius himself : ‚ÄúSo many years have passed it is difficult to recover the facts from the silence in which they are buried‚Äù. Edward Arthur Thompson Thompson, E.A. 1984 St Germanus of Auxerre and the End of Roman Britain, Woodbridge: Boydell Press emphasised how poorly informed Constantius seems to have been about Germanus‚Äôs British visit compared to his activities in Gaul and Italy. Meanwhile, Professor Ian S. Wood Wood, Ian (1984), \\"The End of Roman Britain: Continental Evidence and Parallels\\" in \\"Gildas: New Approaches\\", Lapidge, Michael; Dumville, David N., eds., Woodbridge: Boydell. pp. 1‚Äì25;cf. p.65 in Garcia, Michael \\"Saint Alban and the Cult of Saints in Late Antique Britain\\", Doctoral Thesis, 2010 The University of Leeds: Institute for Medieval Studies has interpreted Constantius' account of Germanus's two British expeditions as in large part 'allegorical' rather than factual. This applies especially to the story told about Elafius where the curing of his son symbolises the spiritual cure that Germanus is bringing to Britain by cleansing it of the Pelagian heresy. It actually forms a direct parallel with the curing of the blind girl, described as having taken place on Germanus's first visit. Even more pertinently Germanus's second visit to Britain, as described by Constantius, has been suspected as representing merely a ‚Äòdoublet‚Äô, of the first: a version that was so badly remembered that it appeared to Constantius or his source as representing an entirely different, 'second', visit. As Norah Chadwick Chadwick, Nora op.cit. pp. 255-61 noted, in both visits the object is the same, Germanus is accompanied by another bishop and the incident of the cured boy of the second visit is matched by an incident in which Germanus cures a blind girl in the first. Then there is the fact that on both visits, as Germanus sets out, there are ‚Äòdemons‚Äô, active against him (in the first they provoke bad weather: in the second we are told they are unable to do this, but instead spread news of his approach). Professor Ian Wood Wood, Ian 1984 op.cit p. 14; cf. Garcia op.cit. p.63, note 105 argued for the authenticity of the second visit: he quoted the Vita Genovefa (Life of St Genevieve) but this (perhaps 6th c. work) is one of many sources written after Constantius's Vita Germani which are likely to have been influenced by it. The allocation to Germanus of a different, named, companion - Severus instead of Lupus - remains hard to explain but it might be that it was details like this (originating perhaps with the oral transmission of one version of the tale) that persuaded Constantius that Germanus must actually have made two separate visits. A recent study by Professor Anthony Barrett Barrett, Anthony A (2009) ‚ÄúSaint Germanus and the British Missions‚Äù in 'Britannia' XL, pp. 197-218. has concluded that the complex problems surrounding the dating of the life of Saint Germanus can be most credibly solved on the basis that he made only one visit. Particularly important to his argument are the near-contemporary mentions made by Prosper of Aquitaine. He mentions Germanus's first visit (under the year 429) but not any second one (in later versions of his chronicle up to 455). In another work (his In Collatorem\\"De Gratia Dei et libero arbitrio; liber contra collatorem\\" in Migne, Patrologia Latina 51: 213-76; trans. Letter, P de (1963) ‚ÄúOn Grace and free Will: against Cassian the Lecturer in Defence of St Augustine‚Äù in 'Ancient Christian Writer's 32 , Westminster Md., Newman Press, pp. 70-139.) he describes the exile of the Pelagians which Constantius attributes to the second visit. In fact Ian Wood Wood, Ian (1984) op.cit p.17 noted that the harsher treatment of the Pelagians on the second visit as something that differentiated it from the first but it could be that it represents, in fact, a desire to corroborate the success of the first visit while allowing a valid purpose for the second. In any case the point is that Prosper's mention in his In Collatorem was almost certainly written before any second visit could take place.e.g. Thompson (1984)op.cit. pp. 29-30 He refers to a lapse of over 20 years since the start of the Pelagian controversy dated to 413 in his chronicle - which would date his In Collatorem to circa 433. Even more decisively he involves Pope Celestine I in this event and since Pope Celestine died in 432 it must have occurred before that time ‚Äì which Professor Barrett argues would not allow time for a second visit.Barrett, Anthony (2009) op.cit pp. 211-12 \\\\- especially since, according to Constantius, that second visit happened after Germanus's visit to Arles to secure tax relief, something that probably occurred in the mid-430s. If the second visit of Germanus to Britain is, indeed, a 'doublet' of the first it would cast something of a shadow over the reliability of, at least the British episodes of Constantius's Vita ‚Äì and certainly everything that occurs in the second visit. This would have to represent a version of the story of Germanus's visit that had changed so much in the telling that it had become unrecognisable as the same as a better recorded version and consequently was assumed by Constantius or his source, to represent another, 'second', visit. It would particularly throw into doubt the figure of Elafius, who is something of a mysterious anomaly, in any case, given that he represents the one and only named Briton in the whole of Germanus's account (besides the martyr-saint Alban). Conceivably he might then represent, like the expulsion of the Pelagians, a detail originally connected with the (first and only) visit of 429. On the other hand, he may represent some outcome of the process of distortion that produced a second 'unrecognisable' version of the story of the first and only visit. As noted above he is connected with an episode (the curing of his son by Germanus) that looks more like allegory than historical fact and which duplicates a similarly allegorical episode (the curing of the blind girl by Germanus) in the \\"first\\" visit. Philip Thornhill Thornhill, Philip (2000) pp. 14-17 in ‚ÄúThe Sub-Roman Cult of Saint Alban‚Äù (‚ÄúSt. Alban and the End of Roman Britain Part 1‚Äù) in 'The Mankind Quarterly' 41, pp. 3-42. .(pp. 16-20 in Revised Version ) suggested that the name actually represents a mis-heard version of a Celtic name Albios or Latin Albius (spoken in a Celtic-influenced dialect of vulgar Latin) that was an alternative name for the cult figure otherwise referred to as Albanus (Saint Alban). He argues that in the pronunciation of the time the names (Elafius and Albios/us) would have sounded very similar. Elafius would then represent a distorted duplicate of the one recorded personal name from Britain that we have in Constantius's account of the first visit: but from leading cult-figure of the region he had become ‚Äúone of the leading men in the country‚Äù (‚Äúquidam regionis illius primus‚Äù). This might fit the allegorical context since the martyr Alban seemed in some way to represent the whole of Christian Britain so in healing Elafius = Albius = Alban ‚Äì or at least his 'son' ‚Äì Germanus was healing (spiritually) the whole of Britain. Thornhill argues further that such a name Abios/us could also have been the basis of the Irish cult of the allegedly ‚ÄúPre-Patrican‚Äù Saint Ailbe of Emly, said to have been baptised by Palladius, who Prosper of Aquitaine tells us was sent to Ireland in 431, shortly after Germanus's visit to Britain. The name Ailbhe, according to Thornhill, would accurately represent a British-Celtic Albios (or Latin Albius, spoken in a Celtic-influenced way) as it would have been borrowed into Irish at the time.

He first became known for playing Tommy Ross, the ill-fated prom date of Carrie White in the original film version of Carrie (1976) and subsequently starred in films such as First Love (1977), Big Wednesday (1978) and Butch and Sundance: The Early Days (1979). Between 1985 and 1988, he starred in nine Perry Mason television films alongside his mother Barbara Hale, who reprised her role as Della Street from the television series Perry Mason. Early life Katt was born in Los Angeles to actors Bill Williams (birth name Herman August Wilhelm Katt) and Barbara Hale. He grew up in the San Fernando Valley and began acting as a teenager, sometimes appearing with his parents. He graduated from Army & Navy Academy, Carlsbad, California. Career William Katt, 2008, at San Diego Comic-Con Katt attended Orange Coast College before pursuing a career as a musician. Inspired by his father, he then started an acting career, appearing in summer stock theatre and in small television roles. His earliest film credits include the role of a jock, Tommy Ross in Brian De Palma's 1976 horror film adaptation Carrie, which allowed Katt to make a name for himself. In 1978, he appeared as Barlow, a young surfer, in the John Milius drama film Big Wednesday opposite Jan-Michael Vincent and Gary Busey. His mother in that film was his real-life mother, Barbara Hale. The following year he took the role of Sundance Kid in the 1979 film Butch and Sundance: The Early Days. The role in Big Wednesday made him so well known in the surfing community that in 2004 he presented one of the Association of Surfing Professionals awards at their annual World Championship Tour ceremony to wild applause from the crowd of professional surfers. Katt explained in a 1979 interview with critic Roger Ebert that he was holding out only for parts that were personally interesting to him. In December 1975, Katt auditioned for the part of Luke Skywalker in 1977's science fiction blockbuster Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, and footage of his audition has been featured in many Star Wars documentaries. He was seriously considered for the role, which went to Mark Hamill, and Katt instead starred that year in First Love, playing a college student who experiences his first romantic relationship. In 1981, Katt was cast as the title role in a filmed version of the Broadway musical comedy Pippin, which received mixed reviews. He won his best remembered role that year, however, as Ralph Hinkley, a mild-mannered schoolteacher given a superpowered suit by aliens on the popular television series The Greatest American Hero, a role he played until the show was canceled in 1983. Also starring veteran actor Robert Culp, the show retains a cult fanbase. Its theme song, \\"Believe It or Not\\", penned by Mike Post, also became a hit in the music charts. In 1982, due to the success of the first season of The Greatest American Hero, Katt signed to MCA and released a soft rock album, Secret Smiles under the name Billy Katt. After The Greatest American Hero, Katt starred in Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend (1985), about explorers searching for apatosaurs in Africa, and the cult horror/comedy film House (1986); he later reprised his role for the third sequel, House IV, in 1992. Between 1985 and 1988, Katt starred in nine Perry Mason television films, playing the role of private detective Paul Drake Jr., son of Paul Drake, a fictional private detective in the Perry Mason television series and the Perry Mason series of detective stories written by Erle Stanley Gardner; Katt co-starred with his mother Barbara Hale, who reprised her role of Della Street from the Perry Mason television series. Katt starred in the 1989 TV series Top of the Hill and made a guest appearance on the first episode of the short-lived 1991 series Good Sports. Katt continues to appear on television and in supporting film roles, and does voice acting as well. He appeared in an episode of House in 2006. In recent years, he has returned to genre work, with appearances in Andromeda and Justice League and roles in the award-winning film Gamers (2006), The Man from Earth (2007), and Alien vs Hunter (2007). Katt briefly appeared in Heroes season 3 in \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" as a nosy reporter investigating Ali Larter's character. He portrayed Jack Matheson in the thriller film, Mirrors 2. In 2010 during season 6, Katt guest starred as C.J. Payne's musician birth-father in the episode \\"Who's Your Daddy Now?\\" in the Tyler Perry comedy House of Payne. Katt also has written a Greatest American Hero comic book and contributed to that series' Facebook page.Spiegel, Danny. \\"Hero Worship\\" TV Guide; June 21, 2010; Page 77 In 2013, Katt played himself in the spoof film Paranormal Movie directed by Kevin Farley.

He was born in Kensington, London. He was educated at Cranbrook School, Kent, and studied medicine at University College London and in Berlin, Germany (1881), and in the same year started his career as a house surgeon and registrar at the University College Hospital. From 1884 to 1890 Horsley was Professor-Superintendent of the Brown Institute. In 1886, he was appointed as Assistant Professor of Surgery at the National Hospital for Paralysis and Epilepsy, and as a Professor of Pathology (1887‚Äì1896) and Professor of Clinical Surgery (1899‚Äì1902) at University College London. He was a supporter for women's suffrage, and was an opponent of tobacco and alcohol. Personal life Sir Victor Horsley was born in Kensington, London, the son of Rosamund Haden and John Callcott Horsley R.A. His given names, \\"Victor Alexander\\", were given to him by Queen Victoria. In 1883 he became engaged to Eldred Bramwell, daughter of Sir Frederick Bramwell. Subsequently, on 4 October 1887, Victor and Eldred married at St. Margaret's, Westminster. They had two sons, Siward and Oswald, and one daughter, Pamela. He was knighted in the 1902 Coronation Honours, receiving the accolade from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October that year. Victor Horsley was a champion of many causes. One of his primary life's crusades was the temperance movement. Having observed that many injuries admitted to the hospital were due to alcohol, Horsley threw himself into becoming a temperance reformer. He soon rose up to the position of a vice-president of the National Temperance League and the president of the British Medical Temperance Association. In 1907, along with Dr. Mary Sturge he published a book on alcoholism called Alcohol and the Human Body. According to his biographers, Tan & Black (2002), \\"Horsley's kindness, humility, and generous spirit endeared him to patients, colleagues, and students. Born to privilege, he was nonetheless dedicated to improving the lot of the common man and directed his efforts toward the suffrage of women, medical reform, and free health care for the working class (...) An iconoclast of keen intellect, unlimited energy, and consummate skill, his life and work justify his epitaph as a \\"pioneer of neurological surgery.\\" Medical career Victor Horsley The blue plaque to Victor Horsley on Gower Street in London Horsley specialized in surgery and in physiology. He was the first physician to remove a spinal tumor, in 1887, by means of a laminectomy. He developed many practical neurosurgical techniques, including the hemostatic bone wax, the skin flap, the ligation of the carotid artery to treat cerebral aneurysms, the transcranial approach to the pituitary gland and the intradural division of the trigeminal nerve root for the surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. As a neuroscientist, he carried out studies of the functions of the brain in animals and humans, particularly on the cerebral cortex. His studies on motor response to faradic electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex, internal capsule and spinal cord became classics of the field. These studies were later translated to his pioneering work in the neurosurgery for epilepsy. Horsley was also the first to use intraoperative electrical stimulation of the cortex for the localization of epileptic foci in humans, between 1884 and 1886, preceding Fedor Krause and Wilder Penfield. He was also a pioneer in the study of the functions of the thyroid gland. He studied myxedema and cretinism, which are caused by a decreased level of the thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism), and established for the first time, in experiments with monkeys, that they could be treated with extracts of the gland. Appointed in 1886 as secretary to a governmental commission formed to study the anti-rabies vaccine developed by Louis Pasteur, Sir Victor Horsley corroborated his results and created a campaign to vaccinate against rabies in the United Kingdom. As a pathologist, Sir Victor carried out research on bacteria and founded the Journal of Pathology. In June 1886 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1891 delivered their Croonian Lecture, jointly with his brother-in-law Francis Gotch, on the subject of the mammalian nervous system. In 1893 he was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. A year later, in 1894, he won the Royal Medal for his investigations relating to the physiology of the nervous system, and of the thyroid gland, and to their applications to the treatment of disease. Horsley, who had been a keen rifle shot when serving in the Artists' Rifles as a medical student, also investigated the effect of gunshot wounds on the brain, experimenting with animals provided by a butcher and using the recently issued Lee-Metford rifle. It dates the beginning of the experiments to 1894. He concluded that the immediate cause of death that follows is due to respiratory failure, not heart failure. It dates beginning of the experiments to 1893. His best-known innovation is the Horsley‚ÄìClarke apparatus (developed together with Robert H. Clarke in 1908) for performing the so-called stereotactic surgery, whereby a set of precise numerical coordinates are used to locate each brain structure. He was a pioneer in neurosurgery, having operated upon 44 patients. He authored the book Functions of the Marginal Convolutions (1884) and, as a co-author, Experiments upon the Functions of the Cerebral Cortex (1888) and Alcohol and the Human Body (1902). Political career He was a Liberal Party supporter and contested the December 1910 General election as Liberal candidate for the London University seat. The Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society campaigned against his election because of his involvement with vivisection.The Newly Restored Bird Bath Memorial near the Thomas Carlyle Statue, Hilda Kean, hildakean.com Following the election he was adopted as prospective Liberal candidate, first for Islington East and then in 1913 for Harborough in Leicestershire. Harborough was a Liberal seat and a general election, expected to take place in 1914 would most likely have seen him elected to parliament. However, he resigned as prospective candidate, citing opposition to his views on women's suffrage and temperance on the part of constituency officials, just before the First World War started. He strongly supported the Liberals' welfare state initiative the National Insurance Act of 1911, despite strong opposition from most of his medical colleagues.Michael S. Dunnill, \\"Victor Horsley (1857‚Äì1915) and National Insurance.\\" Journal of Medical Biography 21.4 (2013): 249-254. First World War service and death Grave of Victor Horsley at Amara War Cemetery. Sir Victor was commissioned in the Territorial Army in 1910 as captain in the 3rd London General Hospital of the Royal Army Medical Corps. On the outbreak of the First World War, he requested for active duty on the Western Front where he was initially sent as surgeon at the British hospital at Wimereux, France. He was next posted in May 1915 as a colonel and Director of Surgery of the British Army Medical Service in Egypt, based at the 21st General Hospital in Alexandria, in support of the Dardanelles Campaign. In the following year he volunteered for field surgery duty in Mesopotamia, where he died unexpectedly in Amarah, Iraq, on 16 July 1916, of heatstroke and severe hyperpyrexia, at only 59 years of age. Namesakes Horsley was the first neurosurgeon appointed to the hospital in Queen Square, London, now called the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery ‚Äì the Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery is named in his honour. The Walton Centre for Neurology & Neurosurgery NHS Trust in Liverpool, England, another leading Neurosurgical Hospital dedicated their Intensive Care Unit to Sir Victor Horsley and is called the Horsley ward. The British Medical Association has a series of lunchtime lectures at its Annual Representatives Meeting entitled The Victor Horsley Lectures. After the second Gulf War, a British Field Hospital was established at Shaibah Logistics Base and the area of tented accommodation for hospital staff was known as Horsley Lines. Dr. Horsely is credited with the invention of the \\"Horsley Hook\\", a device which he used to avulse the trigeminal nerve.

It is located in the northeast part of the state and is bounded by Yadgir district in the north, Bijapur and Bagalkot district in the northwest, Koppal district in the west, Bellary district in the south, Mahabubnagar district of Telangana and Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh in the east. Geography The district is bounded by the Krishna River on the north and the Tungabhadra River on the south. The wedge of land between the rivers is known as the Raichur Doab, after the city of Raichur. Bijapur and Yadgir districts lie to the north across the Krishna River. Bagalkot and Koppal districts lie to the west. Across the Tungabhadra lies Bellary District of Karnataka to the southwest and Mahabubnagar of Telangana to the southeast. Kurnool District of Andhra Pradesh state lies to the east, and includes the lower portion of the Raichur Doab. History The recorded history of the district is traced to as far back as the third century B.C. The fact that three minor rock edicts of Ashoka are found in this district one at Maski in the Lingasugur taluk and the other two near Koppal, prove that this area was included in the dominions of the great Mauryan king Ashoka (273 - 236 B.C.). At that time, this region was under the governance of the Viceroy or Mahamatra of Ashoka. Early in the Christian era, the district appears to have been a part of the kingdom of the Satavahanas. The Vakatakas, who reigned during the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D., seem to have held sway over Raichur for sometime, after which it appears to have been included in the Kadamba dominions. The next dynasty of importance, which ruled over this region, was that of the Chalukyas of Badami. According to an inscription from Aihole, Pulakeshin II having defeated the Pallavas, occupied this area and made it a province in his empire under the governance of his son Adityavarma. Later the whole of the present Raichur district was included in the dominions of the Rashtrakutas, who rose to power in the eighth century, as could be gathered from the inscriptions of that period found in this district. According to an inscription from Manvi taluk, one Jagattunga, a subordinate ruler under the Rashtrakuta king Krishna-II, was ruling the province of Adedore Eradusavirapranta, i.e., the area constituting the present Raichur district. Nripatunga, a Rashtrakuta king, has described Koppal in his Kannada work, Kavirajamarga, as the great Kopananagara. Numerous inscriptions of the Western Chalukyas, found in the various parts of the district, testify to the fact that this region was under their sway for a considerable length of time between the 10th and 12th centuries A.D. It is learnt from an inscription found at Naoli in Lingsugur taluk that during the reign of Chalukya Vikramaditya-V, the Adedore-pranta, i.e., the Raichur region, was being ruled by his younger brother Jagadekamalla-I. Another inscription from Maski describes the place as a capital and makes a reference to the reign of Jayasimha. There were, however, frequent wars between the Chola kings of the south and the Chalukyan kings of Kalyani (aka Western Chalukyas) for supremacy over the Raichur region and the territory had passed into the hands of the Cholas for a brief period. The Haihayas and Sindas also seem to have ruled some parts of this region for sometime. Later, after the fall of the Chalukyas, Raichur passed into the hands of the Kalachuris of Kalyani and later Sevna Yadava kings. Then came the Kakatiyas in the 13th century. From an inscription on the fort-wall of Raichur, referred to earlier, it is learn that the original fort was built by one Gona Ganna Reddy, a general of the Kakatiya queen Rudramma Devi of Warangal, in 1294 A.D., at the instance of the latter.http://www.raichur.nic.in/History.htm Raichur was sacked by Malik Kafur, was commander of Sultanate of Delhi in 1312. Raichur district was passed to Vijayanagara Empire in 1323 after demise of Kakatiyas due to invasions of Sultanate of Delhi. It was captured by Bahmani Sultanate in 1363. It was passed to Bijapur Sultanate in 1489 after fragmentation of Bahmanids. Vijayanagara recaptured it after Battle of Raichur in 1520 but Bijapur recaptured it in 1565 after Vijayanagara's defeat at hands of Deccan Sultanates during Battle of Talikota. Aurangzeb, emperor of Mughal Empire captured the district in 1686. Finally 1724 Raichur became part of Nizam of Hyderabad between 1724 and 1948 except British Empire rule between 1853 and 1860 as part of Madras Presidency. During Nizam rule it was part of Gulbarga Division. After the Operation Polo, Hyderabad State was integrated to Indian Union on 17 September 1948. Between 1948 and 1956, it was part of Hyderabad State. During division of the state on linguistic basis, it became part of Mysore State and later was renamed at Karnataka. Demographics According to the 2011 census Raichur district has a population of 1,928,812, roughly equal to the nation of Lesotho or the US state of West Virginia. This gives it a ranking of 246th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 15.27%. Raichur has a sex ratio of 992 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 60.46%. Raichur District has seven taluks: Raichur, Devadurga, Sindhanur, Manvi, Maski, Sirwar and Lingsugur. The capital of the district is the city of Raichur, which is 409 km from the state capital, Bangalore. Tourism Among the historical attractions in the district is the Raichur Fort, built in 1294. Also notable is the nearby town of Anegundi, which has a number of monuments from the Vijayanagara empire, including the Ranganatha temple, Pampa Lake and Kamal Mahal, MahaLaxmi Temple is located in a nearby village, Kallur, at a distance of 20 km from Raichur. *Deosugur Sri Sugureshwara Temple (Lord Veerabadhra) at the bank of river Krishna, about 18 km from Raichur. Both temples are easily accessible at all times via bus routes. *Maski is a town and an archaeological site.

Economy Raichur Thermal Power Station The Raichur Thermal Power Station at Shaktinagar and Yaramaras Thermal Power Station at Yaramaras, generate electricity for Karnataka. Raichur District is one of few places in India with gold resources. Hatti Gold Mines are situated in Raichur District, around 90 km away from Raichur city. All the five talukas mentioned above are well irrigated, with water from the Tungabhadra Dam on the Tungabhadra River, and the Narayanpura Dam on the Krishna River. Raichur is known for its paddy fields and its rice, which is exported to different countries. It also has a good trading market in cotton industry. In 2006 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Raichur one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640 districts). It is one of the five districts in Karnataka currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF) and that is going to local politicians home.

It was established by The Scripps Research Institute to predict protein structure from protein sequence in the context of the 6th biannual CASP, or Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction. A major goal of the project was the testing and evaluating of new algorithms to predict both known and unknown protein structures. The project was most recently run by the University of Michigan. Predictor@home was complementary to Folding@home. Whereas the latter aims to study the dynamics of protein folding, Predictor@home aimed to specify what the final tertiary structure will be. Also, the two projects differ significantly in the infrastructure they use. Predictor@home used BOINC, whereas Folding@home maintains its own software completely outside of BOINC. However, for a time, Predictor@home competed with other BOINC protein structure prediction projects, such as Rosetta@home. Each uses different methods of rapidly and reliably predicting the final tertiary structure. Predictor@home is currently inactive. History Predictor@Home began as a very successful \\"folding\\" style project with many users. Though it was quite successful, a \\"disagreement\\" between the project administration and the user base caused a mass exodus of participating users which resulted in the loss of productive viability and the project eventually shut down. This is quite notable because it was the first BOINC project to have experienced a \\"user rejection\\" on such a scale. On September 6, 2006, Predictor@home was temporarily taken off line, with no new work units being sent out. In May, 2008, the project reverted to Alpha status, in that it is experimenting with new methods. Over the summer of 2008, the project servers were moved to the University of Michigan. Since December 2008, the project has not sent out any work for some months. BOINC stats sites are unable to obtain updated XML data, as this has been suspended by the project team.

The event takes usually takes place just before or after Halloween weekend and draws inspiration from four traditions: Burning Man, Samhain, D√≠a de los Muertos and All Hallows' Eve.  History  While 2004 was first year that there was an event of this name, it was the second decompression event that has taken place in San Diego. The prior event, known as \\"SD Decom,\\" took place in 2003 and had an estimated attendance of 250. The 2003 event happened to coincide with the October wildfires of that year at a location that was nearly destroyed by fire. In spite of the chilly and damp weather, FDLM managed to draw nearly 500 participants for 2004, perhaps double the attendance of the 2003 event. Two performance stages were set up for DJs, bands and belly dancers. The Mystic Art Grove had a score of art installations. Numerous theme camps were established, including the Purple Turtle Chill Zone, Liquid O, BubbleLounge, Fahrenheit 451, Vibestation, BRC Zendo, Satreheedn, Cantina de los Muertos and Haunted Chill Zone, Camp RVIP, Xara, the Massage Confessional, the Space Bars, Phat Elvis, and more.

It aims to do this by running hundreds of thousands of different models (a large climate ensemble) using the donated idle time of ordinary personal computers, thereby leading to a better understanding of how models are affected by small changes in the many parameters known to influence the global climate. The project relies on the volunteer computing model using the BOINC framework where voluntary participants agree to run some processes of the project at the client-side in their personal computers after receiving tasks from the server-side for treatment. CPDN, which is run primarily by Oxford University in England, has harnessed more computing power and generated more data than any other climate modelling project. It has produced over 100 million model years of data so far. , there are more than 12,000 active participants from 223 countries with a total BOINC credit of more than 27 billion, reporting about 55 teraflops (55 trillion operations per second) of processing power.  Aims  IPCC graphic of uncertainty ranges with various models over time. Climateprediction.net is aiming to reduce the ranges and produce better probability information. The aim of the Climateprediction.net project is to investigate the uncertainties in various parameterizations that have to be made in state-of-the-art climate models. The model is run thousands of times with slight perturbations to various physics parameters (a 'large ensemble') and the project examines how the model output changes. These parameters are not known exactly, and the variations are within what is subjectively considered to be a plausible range. This will allow the project to improve understanding of how sensitive the models are to small changes and also to things like changes in carbon dioxide and sulphur cycle. In the past, estimates of climate change have had to be made using one or, at best, a very small ensemble (tens rather than thousands) of model runs. By using participants' computers, the project will be able to improve understanding of, and confidence in, climate change predictions more than would ever be possible using the supercomputers currently available to scientists. The Climateprediction.net experiment should help to \\"improve methods to quantify uncertainties of climate projections and scenarios, including long-term ensemble simulations using complex models\\", identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 as a high priority. Hopefully, the experiment will give decision makers a better scientific basis for addressing one of the biggest potential global problems of the 21st century. As shown in the graph above, the various models have a fairly wide distribution of results over time. For each curve, on the far right, there is a bar showing the final temperature range for the corresponding model version. As you can see and would expect, the further into the future the model is extended, the wider the variances between them. Roughly half of the variation depends on the future climate forcing scenario rather than uncertainties in the model. Any reduction in those variations whether from better scenarios or improvements in the models are wanted. Climateprediction.net is working on model uncertainties not the scenarios. The crux of the problem is that scientists can run models and see that x% of the models warm y degrees in response to z climate forcings, but how do we know x% is a good representation of the probability of that happening in the real world? The answer is that scientists are uncertain about this and want to improve the level of confidence that can be achieved. Some models will be good and some poor at producing past climate when given past climate forcings and initial conditions (a hindcast). It does make sense to trust the models that do well at recreating the past more than those that do poorly. Therefore, models that do poorly will be downweighted.BOINC Wiki Science Introduction which has been edited by Dave Frame The experiments Climateprediction.net screensaver under BOINC 5.4.9 The different models that Climateprediction.net has and will distribute are detailed below in chronological order. Therefore, anyone who has joined recently is likely to be running the Transient Coupled Model. * Classic Slab Model - The original experiment not under BOINC. See #The original model for further details. This model remains in use solely for the OU short course. * BOINC Slab Model - The same as the classic Slab Model, but released under BOINC. * ThermoHaline Circulation Model (THC) - An investigation of how the climate might change in the event of a decrease in the strength of the ThermoHaline Circulation. This experiment has now been closed to new participants as they have sufficient results. It was a four phase model totaling 60 model years. The first three phases were identical to the above Slab Models. The fourth phase imposed the effects of a 50% slowdown in the Thermohaline circulation by imposing SST changes in the north Atlantic derived from other runs. * Sulfur Cycle Model - An investigation of the effect of sulfate aerosols on the climate. The experiment will model sulfur in a number of compound forms including dimethyl sulfide and sulfate aerosols. This experiment started in August 2005 and was a pre-requirement for the Hindcast. It is a 5 phase model totalling 75 model years. Timesteps are around 70% longer, making the model around 2.8 times longer than the initial slab model. While a few models are still tricking, model have not been issued since 2006. * Coupled Spin-Up Model - Inclusion of oceanic influences into the basic model in a more dynamic and realistic way than the initial Slab Model. This was a pre-requirement for the Hindcast. This has been completed and, as planned, was not publicly released. The fastest 200 - 500 computers were invited to join because it is a 200-year model and results were needed by February 2006 for the Transient coupled model launch. * Transient coupled model - This comprises an 80-year Hindcast and an 80-year Forecast. The Hindcast is to test how well the models perform at recreating the climate of 1920 to 2000. It was launched February 2006 under BBC Climate Change Experiment branding and later also released from the CPDN site. * Seasonal Attribution Project - This is a high resolution model for a single model year to look at extreme precipitation events. This experiment is much shorter due to its single model year, but there are 13.5 times as many cells and timesteps are only 10 minutes instead of 30 minutes. This extra resolution means it requires at least 1.5 Gigabytes of RAM. It uses the HadAM3-N144 climate model.SAP - About History Myles Allen first thought about the need for large Climate ensembles in 1997, but was only introduced to the success of SETI@home in 1999. The first funding proposal in April 1999 was rejected as utterly unrealistic. Following a presentation at the World Climate Conference in Hamburg in September 1999 and a commentary in Nature in October 1999, thousands signed up to this supposedly imminently available program. The Dot-com bubble bursting did not help and the project realised they would have to do most of the programming themselves rather than outsourcing. It was launched September 12, 2003 and on September 13, 2003 the project exceeded the capacity of the Earth Simulator to become the world's largest climate modelling facility. The 2003 launch only offered a Windows \\"classic\\" client. On 26 August 2004 a BOINC client was launched which supported Windows, Linux and Mac OS X clients. \\"Classic\\" will continue to be available for a number of years in support of the Open University course. BOINC has stopped distributing classic models in favour of sulfur cycle models. A more user friendly BOINC client and website called GridRepublic, which supports climateprediction and other BOINC projects, was released in beta in 2006. A thermohaline circulation slowdown experiment was launched in May 2004 under the classic framework to coincide with the film The Day After Tomorrow. This program can still be run but is no longer downloadable. The scientific analysis has been written up in Nick Faull's thesis. A paper about the thesis is still to be completed. There is no further planned research with this model. A sulfur cycle model was launched in August 2005. They took longer to complete than the original models as a result of having five phases instead of three. Each timestep was also more complicated. By November 2005, the number of completed results totalled 45,914 classic models, 3,455 thermohaline models, 85,685 BOINC models and 352 sulfur cycle models. This represented over 6 million model years processed. In February 2006, the project moved on to more realistic climate models. The BBC Climate Change Experiment was launched, attracting around 23,000 participants on the first day. The transient climate simulation introduced realistic oceans. This allowed the experiment to investigate changes in the climate response as the climate forcings are changed, rather than an equilibrium response to a significant change like doubling the carbon dioxide level. Therefore, the experiment has now moved on to doing a hindcast of 1920 to 2000 as well as a forecast of 2000 to 2080. This model takes much longer. The BBC gave the project publicity with over 120,000 participating computers in the first three weeks. In March 2006, a high resolution model was released as another project, the Seasonal Attribution Project. In April 2006, the coupled models were found to have a data input problem. The work was useful for a different purpose than advertised. New models had to be handed out. Results to date The first results of the experiment were published in Nature in January 2005, showing that with only slight changes to the parameters within plausible ranges, the models can show climate sensitivities from less than 2 ¬∞C to more than 11 ¬∞C. The higher climate sensitivities have been challenged as implausible. For example, by Gavin Schmidt (a climate modeler with the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York). =Explanation= Climate sensitivity is defined as the equilibrium response of global mean temperature to doubling levels of carbon dioxide. Current levels of carbon dioxide are around 390 ppm and growing at a rate of 1.8 ppm per year compared with preindustrial levels of 280 ppm. Climate sensitivities of greater than 5 ¬∞C are widely accepted as being catastrophic. The possibility of such high sensitivities being plausible given observations had been reported prior to the Climateprediction.net experiment but \\"this is the first time GCMs have produced such behaviour\\". Even the models with very high climate sensitivity were found to be \\"as realistic as other state-of-the-art climate models\\". The test of realism was done with a root mean square error test. This does not check on realism of seasonal changes and it is possible that more diagnostic measures may place stronger constraints on what is realistic. Improved realism tests are being developed. It is important to the experiment and the goal of obtaining a probability distribution function (pdf) of climate outcomes to get a very wide range of behaviours even if only to rule out some behaviours as unrealistic. Larger sets of simulations have more reliable pdfs. Therefore, models with climate sensitivities as high as 11 ¬∞C are included despite their limited accuracy. The sulfur cycle experiment is likely to extend the range downwards. =Piani et al. (2005)= Published in Geophysical Review Letters, this paper concludes: \\"When an internally consistent representation of the origins of model-data discrepancy is used to calculate the probability density function of climate sensitivity, the 5th and 95th percentiles are 2.2 K and 6.8 K respectively. These results are sensitive, particularly the upper bound, to the representation of the origins of model data discrepancy.\\"  Use in education  There is an Open University short course and teaching material available for schools to teach subjects relating to climate and climate modelling. There is also teaching material available for use in Key Stage 3/4 Science, A level Physics (Advanced Physics), Key Stage 3/4 Mathematics, Key Stage 3/4 Geography, 21st Century Science, Science for Public Understanding, Use of Mathematics, Primary.  The original model  The original experiment is run with HadSM3, which is the HadAM3 atmosphere from the HadCM3 model but with only a \\"slab\\" ocean rather than a full dynamic ocean. This is faster (and requires less memory) than the full model, but lacks dynamical feedbacks from the ocean, which are incorporated into the full coupled-ocean-atmosphere models used to make projections of climate change out to 2100. Each downloaded model comes with a slight variation in the various model parameters. In the initial \\"calibration phase\\" of 15 model years, the model calculates the \\"flux correction\\"; extra ocean-atmosphere fluxes that are needed to keep the model ocean in balance (the model ocean does not include currents; these fluxes to some extent replace the heat that would be transported by the missing currents). In the \\"control phase\\" of 15 years, the ocean temperatures are allowed to vary. The flux correction ought to keep the model stable, but feedbacks developed in some of the runs. There is a quality control check, based on the annual mean temperatures, and models which fail this check are discarded. In the \\"double CO2 phase\\", the CO2 content is instantaneously doubled and the model run for a further 15 years, which in some cases is not quite sufficient model time to settle down to a new (warmer) equilibrium. In this phase some models which produced physically unrealistic results were again discarded. The quality control checks in the control and 2*CO2 phases were quite weak: they suffice to exclude obviously unphysical models but do not include (for example) a test of the simulation of the seasonal cycle; hence some of the models passed may still be unrealistic. Further quality control measures are being developed. The temperature in the doubled CO2 phase is exponentially extrapolated to work out the equilibrium temperature. Difference in temperature between this and the control phase then gives a measure of the climate sensitivity of that particular version of the model. Visualisations Most distributed computing projects have screensavers to visually indicate the activity of the application, but they do not usually show its results as they are being calculated. By contrast, climateprediction.net not only uses a built-in visualisation to show the climate of the world being modelled, but it is interactive which allows different aspects of climate (temperature, rainfall, etc.) to be displayed. In addition, there are other, more advanced visualisation programs that allow the user to see more of what the model is doing (usually by analysing previously generated results) and to compare different runs and models. CPView The real- time desktop visualisation for the model launched in 2003 was developed by Jeremy Walton at NAG, enabling users to track the progress of their simulation as the cloud cover and temperature changes over the surface of the globe. Other, more advanced visualisation programs in use include CPView and IDL Advanced Visualisation. They have similar functionality. CPView was written by Martin Sykes, a participant in the experiment. The IDL Advanced Visualisation was written by Andy Heaps of the University of Reading (UK), and modified to work with the BOINC version by Tesella Support Services plc. Only CPView allows you to look at unusual diagnostics, rather than the usual Temperature, Pressure, Rainfall, Snow, and Clouds. Up to 5 sets of data can be displayed on a map. It also has a wider range of functions like Max, Min, further memory functions, and other features. The Advanced Visualisation has functions for graphs of local areas and over 1 day, 2 days, and 7 days, as well as the more usual graphs of season and annual averages (which both packages do). There are also Latitude - Height plots and Time - Height plots. The download size is much smaller for CPView and CPView works with Windows 98. As of December 2008 there is no visualisation tool that works with the newer CPDN models. Neither CPView nor Advanced Visualisation have been updated to display data gathered from those models. So users can only visualize the data through the screensaver.

The film was a critical failure, but succeeded financially. Plot Cynical newspaper reporter George Beckworth attends a Special Forces briefing about the reasons for American military involvement in the Vietnam civil war (democratic South Vietnam v. the communist Viet Cong). He is shown captured weapons and equipment made in various communist countries, confirming that international communism is the enemy of democracy. When Beckworth remains skeptical about the value of U.S. intervention, Green Beret Colonel Mike Kirby asks him if he's ever been to Southeast Asia. Beckworth admits he hasn't, and decides to go there on a reporting mission. Meanwhile, Colonel Kirby is posted to Vietnam with orders to build a team to work with the South Vietnamese. He catches a man from another unit, Spc. Petersen, appropriating supplies from Kirby's supply depot, but decides to utilise his skills on his new team. Arriving in South Vietnam, they meet Beckworth, whom Kirby allows to accompany them to the front-line camp. Despite signs of humanitarian work, he remains unconvinced of America's need to be in Vietnam. Petersen befriends a young war-orphan Ham Chuck with no family other than his pet dog and the soldiers at the base camp. Also introduced is the South Vietnamese strike force leader Captain Nghiem, who had once fought for the North, but is now fanatically anti Viet Cong. He claims there is a spy network within the camp and his strike force. Following an enemy attack, Sergeant Muldoon notices a South Vietnamese soldier acting suspiciously and knocks him out. When Captain Nghiem interrogates the soldier, he discovers a silver Zippo lighter that belonged to a Green Beret medical specialist, a friend of Kirby's, recently murdered by the Viet Cong. After Beckworth sees Nghiem torture the Viet Cong suspect to get a confession from him, he confronts Kirby about it. The Colonel justifies the interrogation by telling Beckworth about the cigarette lighter, and says the Viet Cong are ruthless killers who deserve no legal protections of any sort in this new kind of war. A few days later, Beckworth accompanies Kirby and his team on a patrol in the nearby mountains. Beckworth witnesses the aftermath of a Viet Cong terror attack. The whole family of a village chief he had befriended earlier have been tortured and executed by the Viet Cong for cooperating with the Americans. The next night, the Special Forces camp is subjected to a human wave attack by thousands of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops. Beckworth is forced to take a rifle from a fallen sergeant and fight alongside the Green Berets. He also helps move the local villagers into the camp to protect them from the enemy onslaught. As the battle rages, Ham Chuck's pet dog is killed and the young boy tearfully buries his faithful companion, before being found by Sergeant Petersen, who takes him to safety with the other refugees. The perimeter is breached by enemy sappers who blow openings in the barbed wire fences around the camp. The Green Berets and South Vietnamese are forced to fall back to the inner perimeter. Captain Nghiem sets off hidden explosives which kill the double agents, and a mortar brings down the observation tower in which Ngheim, Kirby and other officers had been standing. As the other officers move away, Ngheim sets off explosives hidden under the camp approaches but is killed by another mortar immediately after. Kirby and Muldoon arrive with reinforcements, but by dawn the enemy is still attacking, and Colonel Kirby orders the troops to withdraw from the camp. U.S. Army helicopters arrive to evacuate the refugees. Petersen puts Ham Chuck on one and promises to return for him in Da Nang. With the base in enemy hands, Kirby orders an airstrike by a Douglas AC-47, which kills the occupying Northern troops. With the enemy dead or fled, Kirby and his team re-occupy the destroyed camp. Beckworth tells Kirby he will file a story supporting United States involvement in the war, though he'll probably be fired for it. He thanks Kirby for the experience and returns to Da Nang. Back at headquarters, Kirby meets with his superior, Colonel Morgan, as well as Kirby's South Vietnamese counterpart, Colonel Cai. He is told about a top secret mission they have been planning. The goal is to kidnap a very important North Vietnamese field commander named General Pha Son Ti. This is seen as a bargaining chip to end the war on South Vietnam's terms, as well as disrupting the leadership of the Viet Cong. Colonel Cai uses his sister-in-law, a top Vietnamese/French fashion model named Lin, as a honey trap to lure General Ti to a former French colonial mansion in a well-guarded valley in North Vietnam. Kirby, Muldoon, Peterson are among those selected for this secret mission by Cai, who will accompany them, and they are parachuted into the North Vietnamese jungle. Muldoon, medical specialist Doc McGee, and two of Cai's men stay behind at a local bridge over a river to set explosives to blow it up to stop pursuit by the enemy forces as the team exfiltrates with General Ti. Kirby and his group witness the enemy general arriving at his plantation with Lin. As they watch from cover, the scene shifts to the General's bedroom where Lin has sex with the General, being discovered in bed with him after all the sentries around the mansion have been killed. The group subdue the enemy general with Lin's help, and hoist him outside, where they put him in the trunk of his car. Kirby, Cai, Petersen, Watson, and Lin drive away, but the rest of the team is killed by North Vietnamese guards while attempting to escape. At dawn, the survivors cross the bridge which McGee and Muldoon rigged with explosives. The bridge is destroyed, but Doc McGee is seriously wounded as he and Muldoon escape. The survivors of the raid airlift the captured General out of the area by a Skyhook device mounted to a transport plane. While Kirby and the group advance through the jungle to where helicopters will pick them up, Petersen is killed by a booby-trap which leaves him impaled on spikes. The others are forced to leave his body behind. At Da Nang, Beckworth watches as Ham Chuck awaits the return of the helicopters. He realizes the toll of war as Ham Chuck runs crying from helicopter to helicopter, searching for Petersen. Kirby, in a touching moment, walks over to the boy and tells him of Peterson's death. Chuck asks plaintively, \\"What will happen to me now?\\" Kirby places Petersen's green beret on him and says, \\"You let me worry about that, Green Beret. You're what this thing's all about.\\" Holding hands, the two walk along the beach into the sunset as \\"Ballad of the Green Berets\\" plays. Cast * John Wayne as Col.

Wolper, who also tried to buy the same rights, could not obtain financing to make the movie.. A screenplay was written by George Goodman who had served with the Special Forces in the 1950s as a military intelligence officer and had written a 1961 article about the Special Forces called The Unconventional Warriors in Esquire magazine.http://www.bookrags.com/biography/george-jerome-waldo-goodman- dlb/3.html Columbia sent Goodman to South Vietnam for research. Robin Moore felt the Pentagon pressured Wolper into breaking an agreement with Moore. Wolper acquired the rights to film The Devil's Brigade, an account of the World War II 1st Special Service Force, in 1965 and produced that film instead. The final film's origins began in June 1966 with a trip by John Wayne to South Vietnam, and his subsequent decision to produce a film about the Army special forces deployed there as a tribute to them.From \\"The Movemakers\\", The Making of the \\"Green Berets\\" (1968) Wayne was a steadfast supporter of American involvement in the war in Vietnam. He co-directed the film, and turned down the \\"Major Reisman\\" role in The Dirty Dozen to do so. =Screenplay= Although The Green Berets portrays the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army as sadistic tyrants, it also depicts them as a capable and highly motivated enemy. The film shows the war as one with no front lines, meaning that the enemy can show up and attack at almost any position, anywhere. It shows the sophisticated spy ring of the VC and NVA that provided information about their adversaries. Like A Yank in Viet-Nam, it gave a positive view of South Vietnam and their anti-communist allies. The US Army had objections to James Lee Barrett's initial script. The first was that the Army wanted to show that South Vietnamese soldiers were involved in defending the base camp. That was rectified. The Army also objected to the portrayal of the raid where they kidnap a NVA general because in the original script this involved crossing the border into North Vietnam. Robin Moore has stated that while all of the other stories in his book are roman √† clefs of actual Special Forces missions and incidents, the mission to capture General Ti was completely fictitious.Moore, Robin. The Green Berets (New York: Crown Publishing), 1965. Wayne wished the screenplay to have more development of the characters, but Warner Bros. made it clear they wanted more action and less talk, as The Alamo was heavily criticized for having too much dialogue. Scenes shot with Vera Miles as the wife of Wayne's character were jettisoned. (However, Miles was again cast as the Duke's wife in Wayne's next film Hellfighters).p. 293 Munn, Michael John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth Robson, 2004 =Filming= Much of the film was shot in the summer of 1967 (before the Tet Offensive) at Fort Benning, Georgia. Department of Defense cooperation with the film was extensive, with the United States Army providing several UH-1 Huey attack helicopters and a C-7 Caribou light transport. The United States Air Force supplied two C-130 Hercules transports and two A-1 Skyraider attack aircraft as well as film footage of an AC-47 Puff the Magic Dragon gunship and an HC-130 Hercules employing the Skyhook Fulton recovery system for use in the film. The Army also provided authentic uniforms for use by the actors, including the OG-107 green and \\"Tiger Stripe\\" tropical combat uniform (jungle fatigues), with correct Vietnam War subdued insignia and name tapes. John F. Schultz played pivotal roles as an extra as a U.S. soldier and a North Vietnamese Regular. He said of John Wayne, \\"At lunch, the producers were going to feed us peons hamburgers and hotdogs while the main characters ate steak. John Wayne said '...we all get steak or nobody does.' Colonel Lamar Asbury \\"Bill\\" Welch, the actual commander of the United States Army Airborne School at Fort Benning in 1967, makes a brief cameo shooting trap with John Wayne. Welch wears a 1960s US Army Fatigue Baseball Cap (common issue during the Vietnam War) in the scene while the actors wear green berets. Soldiers exercising on the drill field ‚Äì that Wayne shouts to ‚Äì were actual Army airborne recruits in training. The film's large set-piece battle is loosely based on the Battle of Nam Dong on 5‚Äì6 July 1964 when two Viet Cong battalions and the PAVN attacked a CIDG camp at Nam Dong near the Laotian border in South Vietnam's Central Highlands. For five hours, a mixed force of Americans, Australians and South Vietnamese troops fought off a force three times its size. The movie camp set, which was constructed on an isolated hill within Fort Benning, had barbed wire trenches, punji sticks, sandbagged bunkers, mortar pits, towers, support buildings and hooches. Several tons of dynamite and black powder were then used to largely destroy the set during the filming of the battle sequence. Other realistic \\"Vietnamese village\\" sets were left intact after the shooting ended so they could be reused by the Army for training troops destined for South East Asia. =Music= The original choice for scoring the film, Elmer Bernstein, a friend and frequent collaborator with John Wayne, turned the assignment down due to his political beliefs. As a second choice, the producers contacted Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa then in Rome. When asked to do The Green Berets for John Wayne, R√≥zsa replied: \\"I don't do Westerns\\". R√≥zsa was told \\"It's not a Western, it's an 'Eastern'\\".The Green Berets (1968) As a title song, the producers used a Ken Darby choral arrangement of Barry Sadler's 1966 hit song Ballad of the Green Berets, which had been co-written by Robin Moore, author of the original Green Berets novel. R√≥zsa provided a strong and varied musical score including a night club vocal by a Vietnamese singer B·∫°ch Y·∫øn;More Sonobeat Artists however, bits of Onward Christian Soldiers were deleted from the final film. Reception =Critical reception= Upon its cinema release, movie critic Roger Ebert gave it zero stars and cited extensive use of cliches, depicting the war in terms of \\"cowboys and Indians\\", and being a \\"heavy-handed, remarkably old-fashioned film.\\" It is on his \\"Most Hated\\" list. His then-rival at the Chicago Tribune, Clifford Terry, described the film as \\"both predictable and tedious\\" and added that its \\"most fatal mistake\\" was \\"presenting the United States' most complex war in the simplest of terms.\\" The San Francisco Examiner's critic, Stanley Eichelbaum, observed the film thusly: Reviewing for The New York Times, Renata Adler wrote, \\"The Green Berets is a film so unspeakable, so stupid, so rotten and false in every detail that it passes through being fun, through being funny, through being camp, through everything and becomes an invitation to grieve, not for our soldiers or for Vietnam (the film could not be more false or do a greater disservice to either of them), but for what has happened to the fantasy-making apparatus in this country.\\" The screenplay for Oliver Stone's anti-war film Platoon was written partially as a reaction to The Green Berets. It is mocked in the Gustav Hasford novel The Short-Timers in a scene where Joker and Rafter Man find the Lusthog Squad watching it at a movie theater. \\"The audience of Marines roars with laughter. This is the funniest movie we have seen in a long time.\\" The journalist and left-wing activist John Pilger, a strong critic of American foreign policy, described his reaction to The Green Berets in a 2007 speech he gave criticising the media for its coverage of the Vietnam War. \\"I had just come back from Vietnam, and I couldn‚Äôt believe how absurd this movie was. So I laughed out loud, and I laughed and laughed. And it wasn‚Äôt long before the atmosphere around me grew very cold. My companion, who had been a Freedom Rider in the South, said, 'Let's get the hell out of here and run like hell.'\\" Film commentator Emanuel Levy noted in his review that Wayne was not attempting to promote the cause of the Vietnam War as much as he was trying to portray the Special Forces in their unique role in the military: \\"Wayne said his motive was to glorify American soldiers as the finest fighting men 'without going into why we are there, or if they should be there.' His 'compulsion' to do the movie was based on his pride of the Special Forces, determined to show 'what a magnificent job this still little-known branch of service is doing.' ... 'I wasn't trying to send a message out to anybody,' he reasoned, 'or debating whether it is right or wrong for the United States to be in this war.'\\" Levy also notes that Wayne acknowledged that war is generally not popular, but the soldiers who serve face the risks and dangers of combat nonetheless, and must be prepared to sacrifice themselves, regardless of their personal will or judgment. Levy quotes Wayne: \\"What war was ever popular for God's sake? Those men don't want to be in Vietnam any more than anyone else. Once you go over there, you won't be middle-of-the-road.\\" =Box office= Despite the poor reviews, and despite being protested and picketed in the United States and abroad,The Combat Film ‚Äì the death and rebirth of an American film tradition, page 45-47New Approaches to Rhetoric, George N. Dionisopoulos, Chapter 8: John Wayne, the Green Berets, and the Containment Doctrine it went on to be a commercial success, which Wayne attributed in part to the negative reviews from the press, which he saw as representing criticism of the war rather than the film. \\"The critics overkilled me, the picture and the war\\", said Wayne. \\"As a result, so many people went to see it that I had a cheque from the distributors for $8 million within three months. That's the cost of the picture, so we moved into profit the next day.\\" The Green Berets earned rentals of $8.7 million in North America during 1968. This figure is a rental accruing to distributors. =Accolades= The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2005: AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes: ** Col.

The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, simple syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and Pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves. Although the preparation of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly dates back to the 1700s, historians and drink experts agree that the cocktail as it is known today was invented in the early 1920s in Lima, the capital of Peru, by the American bartender Victor Vaughen Morris. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail in the latter part of the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix. In Chile, folklorist Oreste Plath attributed the invention of the drink to Elliot Stubb, an English steward of a ship named Sunshine, who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in the port city of Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb the invention of the whiskey sour‚Äînot the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valpara√≠so, Chile. Cocktail connoisseurs consider the pisco sour a South American classic. Chile and Peru both claim the pisco sour as their national drink, and each asserts ownership of the cocktail's base liquor‚Äîpisco; consequently, the pisco sour has become a significant and oft-debated topic of Latin American popular culture. The two kinds of pisco and the two variations in the style of preparing the pisco sour are distinct in both production and taste. Peru celebrates a yearly public holiday in honor of the cocktail during the first Saturday of February.  Name  The term sour refers to mixed drinks containing a base liquor (bourbon or some other whiskey), lemon or lime juice, and a sweetener. Pisco refers to the base liquor used in the cocktail. The word as applied to the alcoholic beverage comes from the Peruvian port of Pisco. In the book Latin America and the Caribbean, historian Olwyn Blouet and political geographer Brian Blouet describe the development of vineyards in early Colonial Peru and how in the second half of the sixteenth century a market for the liquor formed owing to the demand from growing mining settlements in the Andes. Subsequent demand for a stronger drink caused Pisco and the nearby city of Ica to establish distilleries \\"to make wine into brandy\\", and the product received the name of the port from where it was distilled and exported.  History  = Background = The Plaza de toros de Acho (Lima), the oldest bullring in the Americas, where the predecessor to the pisco sour was sold The first grapevines were brought to Peru shortly after its conquest by Spain in the 16th century. Spanish chroniclers from the time note the first winemaking in South America took place in the hacienda Marcahuasi of Cuzco. The largest and most prominent vineyards of the 16th and 17th century Americas were established in the Ica valley of south-central Peru. In the 1540s, Bartolom√© de Terrazas and Francisco de Carabantes planted vineyards in Peru. Carabantes also established vineyards in Ica, from where Spaniards from Andalucia and Extremadura introduced grapevines into Chile. Already in the 16th century, Spanish settlers in Chile and Peru began producing aguardiente distilled from fermented grapes. Since at least 1764, Peruvian aguardiente was called \\"pisco\\" after its port of shipping; the usage of the name \\"pisco\\" for aguardiente then spread to Chile. The right to produce and market pisco, still made in Peru and Chile, is the subject of ongoing disputes between the two countries. According to historian Luciano Revoredo, the preparation of pisco with lemon dates as far back as the 18th century. He bases his claim on a source found in the Mercurio Peruano which details the prohibition of aguardiente in Lima's Plaza de toros de Acho, the oldest bullring in the Americas. At this time, the drink was named Punche (Punch), and was sold by slaves. Revoredo further argues this drink served as the predecessor of the Californian Pisco punch, invented by Duncan Nicol in the Bank Exchange Bar of San Francisco, California. A recipe for a pisco-based punch, including egg whites, was found by researcher Nico Vera in the 1903 Peruvian cookbook Manual de Cocina a la Criolla; consequently, culinary expert Duggan McDonnell considers that \\"[i]t is entirely possible that the 'Cocktail' that came to be the pisco sour [...] had been prepared for a reasonable time in Lima before being included in a cookbook.\\" = Origin = Victor Morris, inventor of the pisco sour The pisco sour originated in Lima, Peru.See:  * * It was created by bartender Victor Vaughen Morris, an American who had moved to Peru in 1904 to work in a railway company in Cerro de Pasco. Morris relocated to Lima in 1915 and, a year later, opened a saloon‚ÄîMorris' Bar‚Äîwhich became popular with both the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. Chilean historian Gonzalo Vial Correa also attributes the pisco sour's invention to Gringo Morris from the Peruvian Morris Bar, but with the minor difference of naming him William Morris. Morris often experimented with new drinks, and developed the pisco sour as a variant of the whiskey Sour. Some discrepancy exists on the exact date when Morris created the popular cocktail. Mixologist Dale DeGroff asserts the drink was invented in 1915, but other sources argue this happened in the 1920s.See: * * The Chilean web newspaper El Mercurio Online specifically contends historians attribute the year of the drink's invention as 1922, adding that \\"one night Morris surprised his friends with a new drink he called pisco sour, a formula which mixes the Peruvian pisco with the American sour\\" (in Spanish: \\"Una noche Morris sorprendi√≥ a sus amigos con una nueva bebida a la que llam√≥ pisco sour, una f√≥rmula que funde lo peruano del pisco con el 'sour' estadounidense.\\"). Advertisement for Morris' Bar The pisco sour's initial recipe was that of a simple cocktail. According to Peruvian researcher Guillermo Toro-Lira, \\"it is assumed that it was a crude mix of pisco with lime juice and sugar, as was the whiskey sour of those days.\\" A re-print and modern version of the article here. As the cocktail's recipe continued to evolve, the bar's registry shows that customers commented on the continuously improving taste of the drink. The modern Peruvian version of the recipe was developed by Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian from Chincha Alta who worked under the apprenticeship of Morris starting on July 16, 1924. Bruiget's recipe added the Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix. Journalist Erica Duecy writes that Bruiget's innovation added \\"a silky texture and frothy head\\" to the cocktail. Morris used advertisements to promote his bar and invention. The oldest known mention of the pisco sour appears in the September 1920 edition of the Peruvian magazine Hogar. Another old advertisement appears in the April 22, 1921, edition of the Peruvian magazine Mundial. In the magazine, not only is the pisco sour described as a white-colored beverage, but its invention is attributed to \\"Mister Morris.\\" Later, in 1924, with the aid of Morris' friend Nelson Rounsevell, the bar advertised its locale and invention in Valpara√≠so, Chile. The advertisement featured in the Valpara√≠so newspaper South Pacific Mail, owned by Rounsevell. By 1927, Morris' Bar had attained widespread notability for its cocktails, particularly the pisco sour. Brad Thomas Parsons writes that \\"the registry at the Morris Bar was filled with high praise from visitors who raved about the signature drink.\\" Over time, competition from nearby bars and Victor Morris' deteriorating health led to the decline and fall of his enterprise. During this time, due to his worsening constitution, Morris delegated most of the bartending to his employees. Adding to the problem, nearby competitors, such as the Hotel Bol√≠var and the Hotel Lima Country Club, housed bars which took clientele away from Morris' Bar. Moreover, Toro-Lira discovered that Morris accused four of his former bartenders of intellectual property theft after they left to work in one of these competing establishments. In 1929, Morris declared voluntary bankruptcy and closed his saloon. A few months later, on June 11, Victor Vaughen Morris died of cirrhosis. = Spread = The Hotel Bol√≠var is among several Lima hotels still serving the pisco sour cocktail since the closure of Morris' Bar Historian Luis Alberto S√°nchez writes that, after Morris closed his bar, some of his bartenders left to work in other locales. Bruiget began working as a bartender for the nearby Grand Hotel Maury, where he continued to serve his pisco sour recipe. His success with the drink led local Limean oral tradition to associate the Hotel Maury as the original home of the pisco sour. As other former apprentices of Morris found work elsewhere, they also spread the pisco sour recipe. During the 1930s the drink made its way into California, reaching bars as far north as the city of San Francisco. By at least the late 1960s the cocktail also found its way to New York. Beatriz Jim√©nez, a journalist from the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, indicates that back in Peru, the luxury hotels of Lima adopted the pisco sour as their own in the 1940s. An oil bonanza attracted foreign attention to Peru during the 1940s and 1950s. Among the visitors to Lima were renowned Hollywood actors who were fascinated by the pisco sour. Jim√©nez recollected oral traditions claiming an inebriated Ava Gardner had to be carried away by John Wayne after drinking too many pisco sours. Ernest Hemingway and Orson Welles are said to have been big fans of what they described as \\"that Peruvian drink.\\" In 1984, Bolivian journalist Ted C√≥rdova Claure writes that the Hotel Bol√≠var stood as a monument to the decadence of the Peruvian oligarchy (in Spanish: \\"Este hotel es un monumento a la decadencia de la oligarqu√≠a peruana.\\"). He noted the locale as being the traditional home of the pisco sour and recommended it as one of the best hotels in Lima. Nowadays, the Hotel Bolivar continues to offer the cocktail in its \\"El Bolivarcito\\" bar, while the Country Club Lima Hotel offers the drink in its \\"English Bar\\" saloon. = Nationality dispute = Victor Vaughen Morris is considered by most historians to be the inventor of the cocktail. Despite this, there exists an ongoing dispute between Chile and Peru over the origin of the pisco sour. In Chile, a local story developed in the 1980s attributing the invention of the pisco sour to Elliot Stubb, an English steward from a sailing ship named Sunshine. Chilean folklorist and historian Oreste Plath contributed to the legend's propagation by writing that, according to the Peruvian newspaper El Comercio de Iquique, in 1872, after obtaining leave to disembark, Stubb opened a bar in the then-Peruvian port of Iquique and invented the pisco sour while experimenting with drinks. Nevertheless, researcher Toro-Lira argues that the story was refuted after it was discovered El Comercio de Iquique was actually referring to the invention of the whiskey sour. This claim is further certified by the University of Cuyo, Argentina, which in 1962 published the story of Elliot Stubb and his alleged invention of the whiskey sour in Iquique. An excerpt from the newspaper's story has Elliot Stubb stating, \\"From now on ... this shall be my drink of battle, my favorite drink, and it shall be named Whisky Sour\\" (in Spanish: \\"En adelante dijo Elliot ‚Äî √©ste ser√° mi trago de batalla, ‚Äî mi trago favorito ‚Äî, y se llamar√° Whisky Sour.\\").  Preparation and variants  Pisco transported in earthenware containers of the same name from Ica, Peru. Watercolor painting by Afro-Peruvian artist Pancho Fierro The pisco sour has three different methods of preparation. The Peruvian pisco sour cocktail is made by mixing Peruvian pisco with Key lime juice, simple syrup, egg white, Angostura bitters (for garnish), and ice cubes. The Chilean pisco sour cocktail is made by mixing Chilean Pisco with Pica lime juice, powdered sugar, and ice cubes. Daniel Joelson, a food writer and critic, contends that the major difference between both pisco sour versions \\"is that Peruvians generally include egg whites, while Chileans do not.\\" The version from the International Bartenders Association, which lists the pisco sour among its \\"New Era Drinks,\\" is similar to the Peruvian version, but with the difference that it uses lemon juice, instead of lime juice, and does not distinguish between the two different types of pisco. Considerable variations exist in the pisco used in the cocktails. According to food and wine expert Mark Spivak, the difference is in the way both beverages are produced; whereas \\"Chilean pisco is mass-produced\\", the Peruvian version \\"is made in small batches.\\" Cocktail historian Andrew Bohrer focuses his comparison on taste, claiming that \\"[i]n Peru, pisco is made in a pot still, distilled to proof, and un-aged; it is very similar to grappa. In Chile, pisco is made in a column still and aged in wood; it is similar to a very light cognac.\\" Chilean oenologist Patricio Tapia adds that while Chilean pisco producers usually mix vine stocks, Peruvian producers have specific pisco types that use the aromatic qualities of vines such as Yellow Muscat and Italia. Tapia concludes this is why Peruvian pisco bottles denote their vintage year and the Chilean versions do not. Variations of the pisco sour exist in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. There are adaptations of the cocktail in Peru using fruits such as maracuya, aguaymanto, and apples, or traditional ingredients such as the coca leaf. In Chile, variants include the Aj√≠ Sour (with a spicy green chili), Mango Sour (with mango juice), and Sour de Campo (with ginger and honey). In Bolivia, the Yunque√±o variant (from its Yungas region) replaces the lime with orange juice. Cocktails similar to the pisco sour include the Chilean Piscola and the Peruvian Algarrobina Cocktail. Piscola is made by mixing pisco with cola. The Algarrobina Cocktail is made from pisco, condensed milk, and sap from the Peruvian algarroba tree. Another similar cocktail, from the United States, is the Californian pisco punch, originally made with Peruvian pisco, pineapples, and lemon.See: * *  Popularity  Cristina Fern√°ndez and Peruvian president Alan Garc√≠a toast with a Peruvian pisco sour at Peru's Government Palace in 2010 Duggan McDonnell describes the pisco sour as \\"Latin America's most elegant cocktail, frothy, balanced, bright yet rich,\\" adding that \\"Barkeeps throughout Northern California will attest that they have shaken many a Pisco sour. It is the egg white cocktail of choice and an absolutely beloved one by most.\\" Australian journalist Kate Schneider writes that the pisco sour \\"has become so famous that there is an International Pisco Sour Day celebration on the first Saturday in February every year, as well as a Facebook page with more than 600,000 likes.\\" According to Chilean entrepreneur Rolando Hinrichs Oyarce, owner of a restaurant-bar in Spain, \\"The pisco sour is highly international, just like Cebiche, and so they are not too unknown\\" (Spanish: \\"El pisco sour es bastante internacional, al igual que el cebiche, por lo tanto no son tan desconocidos\\"). In 2003, Peru created the \\"D√≠a Nacional del Pisco Sour\\" (National Pisco Sour Day), an official government holiday celebrated on the first Saturday of February. During the 2008 APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, Peru promoted its pisco sour with widespread acceptance. The cocktail was reportedly the preferred drink of the attendees, mostly leaders, businessmen, and delegates. American celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain also drew attention to the cocktail when, in an episode of his Travel Channel program No Reservations, he drank a pisco sour in Valpara√≠so, Chile, and said \\"that's good, but ... next time, I'll have a beer.\\" The broadcaster Radio Programas del Per√∫ reported that Jorge L√≥pez Sotomayor, the episode's Chilean producer and Bourdain's travel partner in Chile, said Bourdain found the pisco sour he drank in Valpara√≠so as boring and worthless (in Spanish: \\"A m√≠ me dijo que el pisco sour lo encontr√≥ aburrido y que no val√≠a la pena.\\"). Lopez added that Bourdain had recently arrived from Peru, where he drank several pisco sours which he thought tasted better than the Chilean version. In Mexico, singer- songwriter Aleks Syntek humorously posted on Twitter that the pisco sour is Chilean and, after receiving critical responses to his statement, apologized and mentioned he was only joking. Mexican television host and comedian Adal Ramones also joked about pisco sour, in reference to the 2009 Chile‚ÄìPeru espionage scandal, on November 17, 2009. Ramones, a fan of Peruvian Pisco, when asked about the espionage, asked what Chileans were spying on in Peru, suggesting it might be how to make a pisco sour (in Spanish: \\"¬øQu√© quieren espiar los chilenos? ¬øC√≥mo hacer pisco sour?\\").

Early years He was born at the Trewarthenick Estate in Cornwall, the son of Francis Gregor and Mary Copley and the brother of Francis Gregor, MP for Cornwall.Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry 1847. on Googlebooks, (Accessed 20 March 2008) He was educated at Bristol Grammar School, where he became interested in chemistry, then after two years with a private tutor entered St John's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1784 and MA in 1787. cf. The Times, Monday, 18 June 1787; pg. 3; Issue 776; col C He proceeded to the MA and was ordained in the Church of England. He became vicar of St Mary's Church DiptfordDiptford on Genuki website and Devon Libraries Local History page on Diptford(no mention of Gregor) near Totnes, Devon. He married Charlotte Anne Gwatkin in 1790 and they had one daughter. Discovery of titanium After a brief interval at Bratton Clovelly, William and his family moved permanently to the rectory of Creed in Cornwall. Here, he began a remarkably accurate chemical analysis of Cornish minerals. In 1791, while studying ilmenite from the Manaccan valley, he isolated the calx of an unknown metal which he named manaccanite. Later in 1791, Martin Heinrich Klaproth discovered what is now known as titanium in the mineral rutile. Believing this to be a new discovery, Klaproth named it titanium after the Titans of Greek Mythology, but eventually it was clarified that Gregor made the discovery first. Gregor was credited with the discovery, but the element kept the name chosen by Klaproth. Gregor later found titanium in corundum from Tibet, and in a tourmaline from a local tin mine. Titanium is now used for many things. Titanium is a transition metal with the atomic number of 22 and atomic mass 47.867. Death and legacy Gregor was an original member of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall in 1814. Never letting his scientific work interfere with his pastoral duties, he was also a distinguished landscape painter, etcher and musician. He died of tuberculosis on 11 June 1817 and was buried at nearby Cornelly church.http://www.cornwall-opc-database.org Accessed May 19th 2019 References External links * * Category:1761 births Category:1817 deaths Category:People from Tregony Category:Cornish geologists Category:People educated at Bristol Grammar School Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:Discoverers of chemical elements Category:Cornish mineralogists Category:18th-century English Anglican priests Category:18th-century British chemists Category:19th-century British chemists Category:Titanium ","title":"William Gregor"},{"id":"1142353","text":"Farranfore () is a village in County Kerry, Ireland.

Part of the University of Wisconsin System, it offers bachelor's and master's degrees. The university has three colleges that serve over 8,000 students on-campus and an additional 3,000 students through its five distance education programs. History An Illustration of the Platteville Normal School, from the 1885 edition of the Wisconsin Blue Book. The university grew from the 1959 merger of two schools: Wisconsin State College, Platteville and Wisconsin Institute of Technology. WSC-Platteville was founded in 1866 as Platteville Normal School, the first teacher preparation school in Wisconsin. It was renamed Platteville State Teachers College in 1926 and Wisconsin State College, Platteville in 1951. The Wisconsin Institute of Technology, founded in 1907 as the Wisconsin Mining Trade School, was founded to train technicians for the numerous mining operations around Platteville. It evolved into the first three-year program for mining engineers in the United States. It changed its name to the Wisconsin Institute of Technology in 1939. The merged school took the name Wisconsin State College and Institute of Technology. In 1966, along with Wisconsin's other state colleges, it was granted university status as Wisconsin State University-Platteville. It took its current name after the Wisconsin State University system merged with the University of Wisconsin in 1971. Starting in the late 1960s, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìPlatteville expanded its academic program and established new colleges, the largest being a business college. The mining college was transformed into an engineering college encompassing mining, electrical, mechanical, and eventually electronic engineering. In the late 1980s, the mining engineering degree was phased out because of falling enrollment. By that time it had been overshadowed by the other engineering degrees. From 1984 to 2000, the Chicago Bears of the National Football League held pre-season training camp at UW‚ÄìPlatteville. They were considered a member of the \\"Cheese League\\" that in 1999 consisted of the Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints and Kansas City Chiefs, with each team practicing at a different university in Wisconsin.\\"Bears ponder migration from Wisconsin,\\" Street & Smith's Sports Business Journal In 2001, the Illinois General Assembly asked the Bears to move to an Illinois practice facility in order to raise funds for remodeling Soldier Field. Before the Bears left, they donated $250,000 to UW‚ÄìPlatteville for a new computer lab, which was named \\"The Bears Den\\". In the 1980s, UW-Platteville made an effort to bring businesses to the Platteville area to take advantage of university resources. Rockwell Automation started this trend in the 1980s when it recruited two engineering professors at UW‚ÄìPlatteville to start an engineering firm. Rockwell provided financing and awarded them major contracts. The resulting business was Insight Industries, which later changed to AVISTA Inc. (now a division of Esterline, Inc.). On June 16, 2014, an EF2 tornado struck the UW- Platteville campus, causing $18.6 million in damage.UPDATE: Tornado caused $18.6 million in damage at UW-Platteville WMTV, June 2, 2015.Photo Gallery: June 16 Tornado and Clean-up UW-Platteville. The Agriculture and Manual Arts Building/Platteville State Normal School, now known as Ullrich Hall, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2018, the University of Wisconsin System restructured through the Collaborative Integration Project, which bound the University of Wisconsin Colleges to the Universities. The University of Wisconsin-Richland and The University of Wisconsin-Baraboo/Sauk County were joined with Platteville as branch campuses, and renamed the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìPlatteville Richland and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìPlatteville Baraboo/Sauk County respectively. Campus UW‚ÄìPlatteville's campus has no city streets that cut through the campus. During the 1960s, all city streets and parking lots within the campus were replaced with wide sidewalks and manicured lawns. UW‚ÄìPlatteville has 13 residence halls. Southwest Hall opened in the fall of 2006. To accommodate a rapidly growing student body Rountree Commons opened in August 2012 and Bridgeway Commons opened in August 2013.\\"new Residence hall construction begins\\" (Internal Email) July 24, 2012 Ullsvik Hall, renovated and expanded between 2006 and 2008, houses administrative offices, academic facilities, visitor center, and other support departments. It also has banquet and catering facilities, including the Robert I. Velzy Commons, and the Nohr Art Gallery. Boebel Hall (math, biology, geography, etc.) Ottensman Hall (engineering) =Student union= Pioneer Student Center In 2002, a new student union, the Pioneer Student Center, was opened at the center of campus. The new location makes the student union the heart of the campus. The union also serves as a technology and activity hub with a large computer lab (the Bear's Den), an involvement center, and on-campus activities. The union houses three of eight dining complexes, the Pioneer Crossing, Pioneer Haus, and The Pioneer Perk. The other location for food on campus is Bridgeway Commons, located in the residence hall section of campus. In 2011 the student center building was named the Markee Pioneer Student Center, after former Chancellor David Markee and his wife Lou Ann. Organization The university is part of the University of Wisconsin System, and has an administrative staff headed by a Chancellor. Its colleges are headed by deans and departments chairpersons who report to the deans. The university consists of three colleges that offer bachelor's and master's degrees: * The College of Business, Industry, Life Sciences and Agriculture - offering programs in modern business and industrial applications, biology and agricultural sciences. * The College of Liberal Arts and Education - with programs in humanities, social sciences (such as psychology), fine arts and education * The College of Engineering, Mathematics and Science - consisting of electrical, mechanical, industrial, civil/environmental, computer science, software engineering, chemistry, engineering physics, and mathematics. Students and faculty In 2004, UWP received approval from the UW system to increase its enrollment from 5,500 to 7,500 students. UWP started a program called the Tri-State Initiative, which aims to attract prospective students from Illinois and Iowa. The enrollment of UWP, as of Spring 2008, stood at 7,795 undergraduates and 830 graduate students. As of 2004, UWP was staffed by 336 faculty. Distance education Brigham Hall (Registrar, tutoring services, etc.) In 1978, the University introduced print-based courses to enable Wisconsin residents living in isolated areas to earn an undergraduate degree in business administration without having to travel to a university campus. In 1996, the residency requirement was amended and the distance program was extended to working adults living throughout the United States. In 1999, online graduate programs in criminal justice, engineering, and project management were introduced, allowing students throughout the world to earn an accredited degree at a distance from UW‚ÄìP. In addition to accredited degree programs, UWP has also developed online leadership and management courses in association with the Wisconsin Department of Justice and on-site project management courses in association with a project management consulting company. Extracurricular activities Sculpture ensemble \\"Stratagem\\" UW‚ÄìPlatteville has over 250 clubs and organizations including American Foundry Society. =Athletics= UW‚ÄìPlatteville is a member of the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 14 sports, including football and basketball. The teams are nicknamed the Pioneers. Men's sports include basketball, football, indoor & outdoor track and field, cross country, wrestling, soccer, and baseball. Women's sports include basketball, soccer, indoor & outdoor track and field, volleyball, cross country, golf, softball, and cheerleading. All teams compete in NCAA Division III and Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. There are also a number of club sports teams such as hockey and lacrosse which are partially funded through the university. The men's basketball team won NCAA Division III championships in 1991, 1995, 1998, and 1999. The Pioneers qualified for the Division III men's basketball tournament from 1991-1999 and returned 10 years later in 2009. Bo Ryan, who later became head coach of the Wisconsin Badgers, guided the Pioneers to a 353-76 record and the best winning percentage in NCAA Division III basketball. Ryan established one of the best home court advantages of all time as the Pioneers only lost 5 games at home in a decade. The team averaged 26 wins a season in the 1990s, when the Division III men's regular season schedule only allowed 25 games per year. The university named the basketball floor \\"Bo Ryan Court\\" in January, 2007. *Ralph E.

It lies 50 km (31 mi) east of Johannesburg and 72 km (45 mi) southeast from Pretoria. The name of Springs derives from the large number of springs in the area; it has an estimated population of more than 121,610 in 2011 and is situated at 1628 m (5,340 ft) a.s.l. Springs was divided during the Apartheid era into the middle- and upper-income white suburbs around the city centre, the Indian area of Bakerton east of the CBD, while black people were relocated to KwaThema, southwest of the CBD. History The city of Springs, east of Johannesburg, is on the East Rand, or what is now known as the Metropolitan area of Ekurhuleni, in the Gauteng Province. It was founded as a coal and gold mining town in 1904, but its history can be traced back to the second half of the 19th century. From about 1840 farmers moved into the area and declared farms for themselves, especially after the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (South African Republic, later Transvaal) became an independent republic with the signing of the Sand River Convention in 1852. These initial farms were large, but the measurements of the borders were inaccurate and later, when the correct borders of the farms had to be documented, there were several extra or odd pieces of land that did not belong to any farm. These odd pieces of land then became state property. Such an odd piece existed between three neighbouring farms on the Witwatersrand, namely Geduld (meaning 'patience'), De Rietfontein ('the reed fountain') and Brakpan (literally, 'small, brackish lake'). The 685 ha odd piece was given the name 'The Springs' by the land surveyor James Brooks, probably because of all the fountains on the land. Another story is that he wanted to name it after himself, but because his name (Brooks) resembled the Afrikaans word 'broek' (trousers) so closely, he feared that the Afrikaans farmers in the area would mock it. On 16 September 1884 the official map of The Springs was registered in Pretoria, the Republic's capital. Initially, the land's value was equal to R200. But the discovery of coal and gold and its subsequent mining increased the value considerably. The coal discovered in The Springs was of a good quality and in 1888 the first contract was signed to mine coal there. Initially mining was on a small scale, but rose when the Great Eastern mine was established. There were a number of corrugated iron houses around the mine and, although there was a few small hotels and general dealers, it was not a town yet. The settlement grew and in 1902 a health committee was appointed to look after the building and location of structures and also the hygiene in the growing township. In 1904 the Grootvlei Proprietary Mines were registered and shafts were sunk. This followed the discovery in 1899 of gold on the farm Geduld and the further discovery of the main reef in 1902. In April 1904 The Springs was proclaimed a town, called Springs, the health committee replaced by a town council, and it flourished as a mining town. In 1962, Springs produced 10% of the country's gold and 9% of its uranium. However, by the end of the 1960s the last mine in town, the Daggafonteinmyn, (literally: Marijuana fountain mine) was emptied. The town did not die, but instead developed into an industrial centre. The original 7 km¬≤ farm on which the city of Springs was later to be built, The Springs, was surveyed in 1883. Coal was discovered in the area in 1887 and three years later in 1890‚Äì1891, the Transvaal Republic's first railway, the Randtram Line, was built by the Netherlands-South African Railway Company (NZASM) to carry coal from the East Rand coalfields to the gold mines of the Witwatersrand. Gradually, especially after coal was discovered further east in South Africa in Witbank, the Springs collieries were closed. In the meanwhile, however, gold had also been discovered in the area. A village was laid out in 1904 and in 1908 the first gold mining began. Springs was granted municipal status in 1912. By the late 1930s, there were eight gold mines near Springs, making it the largest single gold-producing area in the world. Springs is currently one of the industrial centers of the Witwatersrand and also the Eastern Gateway of Gauteng towards Mpumalanga and Northern Kwazulu Natal. Mining has been replaced by manufacturing and engineering industries of economic importance; products of the region include processed metals, chemicals, paper and foodstuffs. Geography =Communities= The centre of Geduld-Extension suburb Although Springs is a highly industrial city, its suburbs are treelike with many parks and also giving some suburban character.

These Art Deco buildings were constructed during the period between the two World Wars. Other landmarks include several monuments to important figures in the city's development, like Paul Kruger, and the war cemetery where many Coloured soldiers are buried who died during the Second World War fighting in the Allied Forces. There is also the War Monument at the northern entrance of the Springs CBD, The Old Springs Fire Station, and the Dutch Windmill in the Pioneer Park, Springs. There is a small scale replica of the Voortrekker Monument in the Springs CBD near the library. Springs has an art gallery next to the Springs Library. At the entrance of the Springs Railway station there is an old orange tree planted by the Dutch people when Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands visited the old South African Republic accompanied by the then South African president Paul Kruger. Many theatrical productions are performed at the Springs Civic Theater. The Springs Civic Centre and City Hall is also a unique building complex as it rested on hey logs with water underneath. The Springs Fire Station is also one of the Art Deco Buildings as seen from the Boksburg Road towards Downtown Springs. There is also the Mudhook Hall opposite the Springs Civic Center. That Hall is being built in honor of the M.O.T.H., which stands for the Members of the Order of the Tin Hat Soldiers who fought during world war two. It is also an Art Deco building and overlooking the Down Town Springs from the Western Side File:Front Side of the Springs City Hall.jpgCity Hall front File:Springs City Hall.jpgCity Hall side File:Springs Fire Station.jpgArt Deco Fire Station File:Mudhook Hall, west of the Springs CBD.jpgMudhook Hall = Climate = Springs has a typical sub-tropical climate with four distinct seasons. The summers are hot with afternoon thunder showers in early summers and drier during January and February which are the two hottest months. The winters are very cold with severe frost and very occasional snow, the coldest months being July and August although June is also very cold. August is usually a very windy month continuing into early spring of September with sandstorms and strong winds. Spring is warm to hot with some afternoon showers. Spring usually starts to show during the latter half of August although it is officially springtime from September. The autumns are generally cooler, starting with late rains in the beginning of autumn and getting colder towards winter with the first frost in late autumn. At times the first signs of autumn can be seen in late February. The average highs during the summers are 32 ¬∞C (90 ¬∞F) although it can go as high as 37 ¬∞C (99 ¬∞F). A record high of 40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F) has been recorded. Average winter temperatures are around 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F) and the average lows during the summer months are 15 ¬∞C (59 ¬∞F) and ‚Äì 5 ¬∞C (23 ¬∞F) during the winter months. Temperatures can drop to ‚Äì 10 ¬∞C (14 ¬∞F) and a record low of ‚àí15 ¬∞C (5 ¬∞F) has been recorded. The average rainfall in Springs is 450 mm (18 inches) per annum. = Fauna and flora = Springs has a Highveld grassland vegetation, which is the general vegetation type of the Highveld which consists of the southern half of Gauteng, Western Mpumalanga, South Eastern parts of the Limpopo province, most of the Freestate, Northern Eastern Cape and South Eastern parts of Northwest and Eastern Northern Cape. Springs is mostly grassland with short grass with some smaller succulent plants such as the aloe. The plough-breaker which is unique on the Highveld with most part of the plant in the soil can also be found. The wetland areas in Springs has an area of 17 km2 (6.6 mi2) fed by the Blesbokspruit and Lesser Blesbokspruit, with concomitant water plants and trees growing nearby. The Blesbokspruit Wetland Region in Springs draws over 300 species of birds, including the great flamingo, Egyptian Goose, barn owl, blue kite, blue crane, guineafowl, secretary-bird and the ostrich. Water mammals such as the otter and lesser otter have been observed in less populated areas. The blesbok, mongoose, reed buck, read jackal, black wildebeest, springbok, mountain zebra, the porcupine and other mammals are to be found, but usually within reserve areas. Various species of reptiles such as the rinkhals, puffadder brown house snake, aurora house snake and various lizards, including the giant girdled lizard, and the African bullfrog are also to be found in wetland areas of Springs. Demographics =Jewish community= Up until the late 1990s Springs had a vibrant Jewish community. There were two synagogues, with a total of 300 families. Today (2015) most of the community has left for Johannesburg, Cape Town, or further afield like Israel, Australia, the US and the UK. Economy Springs as a city is an economic hub in Ekurhuleni with a diverse economy, ranging from manufacturing, commerce, service, hospitality, mining and service providing companies. = Mining = Historically, Springs was known as a mining centre for two major types of minerals (gold and coal). Springs is still one of the gold mining centers in South Africa, which includes Gold One, Modder East Operation, the Geduld Mine and East Geduld Mine and also the Daggafontein and East Daggafontein mines. Besides gold, new coal mines towards the east of the city are being developed. = Manufacturing = Springs is one of the industrial centres in Gauteng served by four industrial suburbs, which are New Era, Nuffield, Enstra and Fulcrum with smaller industrial areas at Dersley, suburb of Springs, Daggafontein, Selection Park, Selcourt and Strubenvale. There are a couple of manufacturing companies in Springs. The only Kelloggs factory in South Africa is situated in Springs. Springs is also home to Impala Platinum's precious and base metal refineries as well as PFG Building Glass Building Glass, the only producer of float glass on the continent. Zincor, the only zinc producer in Africa, was also located here; its refinery used to produce all South Africa's requirement of this metal and ceased its production operations in 2011 due to various economic reasons. Springs is home to Sappi Enstra Mill, the only paper mill plant of Southern Africa, only paper mill plant in the world that is not next to a river, Element Six Ultra High, an industry in industrial diamonds and beverage cans, manufacturing of cans and Kimberly-Clark in Enstra manufacturing toilet paper, tissues, serviettes and other products.

The series consists of 90 episodes, which were originally broadcast on the Italian channel RAI between 1971 and 1986. All episodes were short subjects, ranging from 2:28 to 6:37 in runtime. Over the years the series aired in more than 40 countries around the world. Due to the short length of episodes, the series have often been used in many networks as an interstitial program. The background tune for the series was created by Franco Godi. Even though the episodes are numbered up to 225, there are, in fact, only 90 La Linea episodes. The 1971 series had 8 (4 min) episodes, the 1978 series had 56 (101-156), and the 1986 series had 26 (200-225). All episodes of the series are available today on DVD.  Synopsis  The cartoon features a man (known as \\"Mr. Linea\\") drawn as a single outline around his silhouette, walking on an infinite line of which he is a part. The character encounters obstacles and often turns to the cartoonist, represented as a live- action hand holding a white grease pencil, to draw him a solution, with various degrees of success. One recurring obstacle was an abrupt end of the line. The character would often almost fall off the edge into oblivion and get angry with the cartoonist and complain about it. He was voiced by Carlo Bonomi in a mock version of Milanese that resembled gibberish as much as possible, with occasional Italian or English words, giving the cartoon the possibility to be easily exported without dubbing. The voice resembles Pingu's, the Swiss- British animated penguin, which was also voiced by Bonomi. The first 8 episodes of the series were, in fact, created to publicize Lagostina kitchenware products, and the accompanying narration identified Mr. Linea as \\"Agostino Lagostina, a sharp little man with a truly expressive nose.\\" After the 8th episode, however, the series broke its association with Lagostina. =Television= From 1972 on La Linea was shown on numerous TV stations in Europe as well as in cinema, mostly as interstitial between commercials. La Linea was shown in more than 40 countries over the world.

Not all La Linea cartoons were featured on this show, as some had a mature theme and were therefore considered inappropriate for children. * It was also featured as part of KQED's International Animation Festival in the 1970s * La Linea was also featured on Nickelodeon during Pinwheel as one of their animated shorts. * In United Kingdom, La Linea was aired on ITV Called CITV from 1983 to 2003, and later on ITVBe and Channel 4. * In Canada, the La Linea cartoons aired on Radio-Canada and TVO. * In South Africa it was aired on SABC during the late 1980s and early 1990s. * It was screened by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Australia as a filler between longer programmes. * From June 30, 2008 until October 31 the same year, Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet published all episodes of La Linea as daily episodes on its website(La Linea 1-8, La Linea 101-156, and La Linea 200-225). =Comic adaptations= Cavandoli also adapted his animated cartoon series into a comic strip. =DVD releases= A set of three DVDs containing all the episodes was released in Germany in 2003 and re-edited in September 2008.

He is one of the most popular artists in Norway. Kittelsen became famous for his nature paintings, as well as for his illustrations of fairy tales and legends, especially of trolls. His most well-known works have a distinctive monochrome, grainy quality.Theodor Kittelsen ‚Äì tusenkunstneren fra Krager√∏ (Kittelsenhuset. Berg ‚Äì Krager√∏ Museum) Early life Ship in Storm by a Lighthouse (1892), black and white sketch Kittelsen was born in the coastal town of Krager√∏ in Telemark county, Norway. His father died when he was young, leaving a wife and eight children in difficult circumstances. Theodor was only 11 years old when he was apprenticed to a watchmaker. When at the age of 17 his talent was discovered by Diderich Maria Aall, he became a pupil at Wilhelm von Hanno‚Äôs drawing school in Christiania (now Oslo). Because of generous financial support by Aall he later studied in Munich. However, in 1879 Diderich Aall could no longer manage to support him, so Kittelsen had to earn his money as a draftsman for German newspapers and magazines. Career In 1882 Kittelsen was granted a state scholarship to study in Paris. In 1887 he returned to Norway for good. When back in Norway, he found nature to be a great inspiration. He spent the next two years in Lofoten where he lived with his sister and brother-in-law at Skomv√¶r Lighthouse. Kittelsen also started to write texts to his drawings there. Theodor Kittelsen and his family settled in a home and artist studio which he called Lauvlia near Prestfoss during 1899. Kittelsen spent his best artistic years here. During this period, Kittelsen was hired to illustrate Norwegian Folktales (Norwegian: Norske Folkeeventyr) by the Norwegian folklore collector Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen and J√∏rgen Moe. In 1908 he was made Knight of The Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. However, he was forced to sell and leave Lauvlia in 1910 due to failing health. He was granted an artist‚Äôs stipend in 1911 but died in poverty in Jel√∏ya in 1914.Theodor Kittelsen, Famous Norwegians Style Kittelsen's style could be classified between Neo-Romantic and na√Øve painting. As a national artist he is highly respected and well known in Norway, but doesn't receive much international attention, which is the reason that his name is often not included in registers of internationally recognized painters and artists.Theodor Severin Kittelsen 150th Anniversary Norway Post, 27 April 2007 Dedicated museums Lauvlia, his home from 1899-1910, is located north of Prestfoss along Route 287, with scenic view of Lake Soneren. The surrounding area, in particular Mount Andersnatten which overlooks the lake a few kilometres north, inspired some of Kittelsen's most famous landscapes. Today Lauvlia is a private museum featuring an exhibition of Kittelsen‚Äôs original work. Lauvlia is decorated with Kittelsen's own woodcarvings and murals. A new exhibition of original Kittelsen works is opened each year with painting and drawing activities arranged for children. The paintings exhibited are rotated each year.Lauvlia - Theodor Kittelsen's Home Norwegian Heritage Foundation. Norsk Kulturarv The national Theodor Kittelsen Museum at Blaafarvev√¶rket is at the Skuterudh√∏yden ridge by the Cobalt Mines. Kittelsen‚Äôs poetical interpretations of nature, the forest, the mountains and trolls are presented in the form of carved furniture, oil paintings, watercolours and drawings. New exhibitions each year. In 2014 are Blaafarvev√¶rket in charge of arranging the biggest exhibition held ever in modern times. The house where the artist grew up in Krager√∏ is also currently a museum devoted to his legacy. Cultural references Black metal and folk metal bands such as Burzum, Empyrium, Otyg and Satyricon have used some of his pictures as album art, notably illustrations taken from Kittelsen's book Svartedauen (The Black Death). Musiciain Phil Elverum named the tenth song on his 2017 album A Crow Looked at Me after Kittelesen's painting \\"Soria Moria\\" specifically, using it as an illustration of his grief. Kittelsen's 160th birthday was celebrated in a Google Doodle on 27 April 2017, giving him some exposure outside of Norway.

Voice actor Daws Butler performed the show's title character, Quick Draw McGraw. The show debuted in syndication on January 1, 1959, ended its run on October 20, 1961, and was sponsored by Kellogg's. The series featured three cartoons per episode, with Quick Draw and his sidekick Baba Looey appearing in the first segment, father and son dog duo Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy in the second, and cat and mouse detectives Snooper and Blabber in the third. Michael Maltese wrote most of the episode stories. Screen Gems originally syndicated the series. Segments =Quick Draw McGraw and Baba Looey= Quick Draw (voiced by Daws Butler) was usually depicted as a sheriff in these short films set in the American Old West. Quick Draw was often accompanied by his deputy, a Mexican burro called Baba Looey (Butler). Although technically the side-kick, or deputy, to the main character of Sheriff Quick Draw, Baba Looey is often portrayed as the more thoughtful half of the duo; at times realizing some detail about a given situation and trying desperately without success to caution Quick Draw of a trap or other danger. The exchange would always go as follows: Baba Looey would see a fatal flaw in Quick Draw's plan, and begin voicing a warning such as \\"I don' thin' we should be doing...\\", to which Quick Draw would angrily interrupt with his frequent catchphrase, \\"I'll do the 'thin'in' around here, Baba Looey!\\" His plans would then go disastrously wrong, and Quick Draw would be forced to realize he should have listened to Baba Looey. Quick Draw was assisted in some cartoons by his bloodhound Snuffles (voiced by Butler), who refused to work until he was given a dog biscuit, after which he would hug himself and spring into the air, floating back down to Earth.

Baba Booey mispronunciation On the July 26, 1990 broadcast of The Howard Stern Show, executive producer Gary Dell'Abate was talking about the animation cels that he buys and collects. When attempting to say 'Quick Draw and Baba Looey', he accidentally said 'Quick Draw and Baba Booey'. He said later that talking about it would last a few hours. But since then, hundreds of 'Baba Booey' song parodies have been played on The Howard Stern Show. 'Baba Booey' is often yelled out during live news broadcasts and it has become something that is yelled at golf tournaments after the ball is struck.

He served as the Metropolitan Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels and the chairman of the episcopal conference of his native country from 1979 to 2010. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1983. His resignation that he had submitted in 2008 at the age of 75 was accepted by Pope Benedict XVI on 18 January 2010. Early life and studies Born in Kanegem, West Flanders, Godfried Danneels was the eldest of six siblings. He owed his vocation to the priesthood to a priest he had as a teacher in high school, Daniel Billiet.As Danneels himself said in his final homily as archbishop. M&S; 502. Like a few other bright candidates for the priesthood from West Flanders, Danneels did not enter the episcopal Seminary of Bruges after he finished high school, but was sent directly to the Higher Institute of Philosophy of the Catholic University of Leuven, there to follow a three-year course of Neo Scholastic philosophy (1951‚Äì1954). Leuven, with which he remained \\"in love\\" his entire life, opened the world for him intellectually.B&L; 25. From Leuven he was sent to Rome, where he studied Catholic theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University whilst living in the Belgian Papal College (1954‚Äì1959). With a few exceptions, he judged the quality of his courses there inferior to those in Leuven, but Rome greatly enriched him culturally.B&L; 50. Danneels obtained his bachelor's degree in June 1956, his license in 1958, and his doctorate in 1961.M&S; 69, 70, 77. His results as a student were uniformly excellent, including an A‚Äì for canon law, and a magna cum laude for his license.M&S; 47‚Äì76. Ordination Well before the end of his studies, he was ordained to the priesthood by Emiel Jozef De Smedt, Bishop of Brugge in a ceremony in the Kanegem parish church on 17 August 1957, the 25th wedding anniversary of his parents.M&S; 70‚Äì71. Professor and pastor In 1959, De Smedt appointed him spiritual director of the Bruges episcopal seminary and at the same time professor of liturgy and spirituality. In 1960 he also took over Frans Neirynck's course on the sacraments.M&S; 86. His study of the literature on liturgy made him evolve from a Rome-educated and initially conservative liturgist into a modern one, and a well-known one, thanks to his articles in the Dictionary of the Liturgy.Timothy P. Schilling \\"A Conversation with Godfried Cardinal Danneels\\" Image #54; also available here. The claim that he was actively involved in writing Sacrosanctum Concilium is dubious, for he did not attend the Second Vatican Council. But he did play a very active role in the implementation of the liturgical reforms of Sacrosanctum Concilium, not only in the Bruges diocese, but in all of Belgium and even abroad. He was very much taken with these reforms, for in Belgium and the Netherlands many had been foreshadowed in liturgical experiments. However, he did not call for liturgical revolution in his writings and talks, favoring steady and measured innovation instead. Even so, from the middle sixties he felt pressurized by Rome (in particular by cardinal Giacomo Lercaro), which was trying get a firmer grip on the liturgical journals in which he wrote.M&S;, chapter 4. On 8 July 1969, Danneels was appointed lector at the Faculty of Theology of the Catholic University of Leuven. Initially the appointment was for two years, but Danneels was to stay until 31 January 1978,M&S; 136. shortly after he was consecrated bishop. In Leuven he became thoroughly interested in what was to become his \\"hobby horse\\",Sic, Dutch stokpaardje; M&S; 115. the interlocking of theology and humanism, which he was to develop throughout his life in both his academic and his pastoral writings. The latter too were numerous and important, for when he was relieved of his spiritual directorship at the Bruges seminar in the summer of 1967, he was put in charge of the continuing education of the priests of the Bruges diocese.M&S;, chapter 5. Bishop On 4 November 1977, Danneels was named Bishop of Antwerp by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 18 December from Cardinal Leo Joseph Suenens; co-consecrators were his predecessor Jules Victor Daem and his Bruges bishop De Smedt. The consecration, in a Dutch-language rite in whose development Danneels himself had been involved as a liturgist, took place in St. James', as the Antwerp cathedral was being restored at the time.M&S; 124. Three days after his consecration he invited Catholics to write him personally with suggestions for their new bishop and he made the rounds of his diocese to consult with people. He used the media, extensively and successfully, to expound his vision of Christian humanism. In this he can be claimed to have been \\"modern\\". But in many ways he was traditional and careful of what Rome desired. From the beginning of his episcopacy, he faced an acute problem of numerous priests leaving their ministry. In spite of this, he energetically defended the traditional demand of the Church that priests remain celibate. In July 1978 he was appointed a member of the Curial Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, just at the time when Edward Schillebeeckx was first investigated by the Congregation. In the face of great pressure from the Leuven Faculty of Theology, he did not intervene on Schillebeeckx's behalf.M&S; 141‚Äì142. Encouraged and aided by his predecessor, Danneels began to build what was to become a very extensive network, which included numerous Belgian politicians. This would be important for his work in the next station of his life.M&S;, ch. 6. Archbishop and cardinal =Promotion to archbishop and creation as cardinal= Danneels was promoted to the Archbishopric of Mechelen-Brussel on 19 December 1979. He thus became Primate of Belgium, president of the Belgian Conference of Catholic Bishops, chancellor of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and the Universit√© catholique de Louvain and head of the nation's Catholic military ordinariate, at first as vicar, from 1987 as bishop.B&L; 142. Pope John Paul II followed the tradition that the Mechelen archbishop be made a cardinal, and created him Cardinal- Priest of Santa Anastasia in the consistory of 2 February 1983.M&S; 160‚Äì161. =Survey of his career as cardinal-archbishop= There are two rather distinct periods in Danneels' career as Cardinal-Archbishop. In its first ten to fifteen years, Danneels' relations with Rome were excellent. He was appointed to a number of pontifical congregations and councils. In addition to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, to which he had already been appointed in 1978, he was a member of:M&S; 161. * the Congregation for Bishops * the Congregation for the Clergy * the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples * the Congregation for Catholic Education * the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments * the Pontifical Council for Dialogue with Non-Believers He was also a member of the permanent secretariat of the episcopal synod and participated in a number of synodsA full list through 2008 on this website of the Vatican; for his notable role in some of them, see further in this article. But his own enthusiasm about the government of the Church by the Vatican waned. He did not approve of the way Pope John Paul II restricted the role of bishops' conferences like CELAM (1992)See Ivereigh 255‚Äì257 and 373, where that author speaks of \\"the Vatican's steamrolling of CELAM in 1992\\". and especially of CCEE (1993).,M&S; 308‚Äì313. in which he played a prominent role until 1993. The bishops' synods were being reduced to rubber stamping the decisions of Rome, and neither the bishops' collegiality nor Vatican centralism could be discussed.Ivereigh 261‚Äì264. The result of this change was threefold:M&S; 328. * As Rome was perceived to turn to the right, Danneels, who considers himself an \\"extreme centrist\\", was more and more perceived as a leftist or a liberal, in spite of himself. * As Danneels gradually increased the distance between himself and Rome, his popularity at home increased and he became the face of the Catholic Church in Belgium, to the local issues of which he devoted more and more of his time. * He also devoted more and more of his time to international tasks, which often involved his diplomatic abilities as well as his prestige. After the 2013 conclave he again felt at ease in Rome,M&S; 500. but by then he had already retired as archbishop. =Danneels and the Belgian court= As primate of Belgium, Danneels officiated at every great ceremony at the royal court. Royal baptisms * Elisabeth, duchess of Brabant * Amedeo, Archduke of Austria * Prince Emmanuel * Prince Gabri√´l * Princess Eleonore Royal funerals * King Boudewijn and Queen Fabiola * King Leopold III * Lilian, Princess of R√©thy Royal marriages * The Duke of Brabant, Crown prince Philippe and Jonkvrouw Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz, since July 2013 King and Queen of the Belgians * Lorenz, Archduke of Austria-Este and Princess Astrid * Prince Laurent and Ms Claire Coombs * Amedeo, Archduke of Austria and Archduchess Elisabetta of Austria-Este * Archduchess Marie-Christine of Austria and Rodolphe, Count of Limburg Stirum Danneels' relations with the court were good, but not particularly close. He even denied having a close relationship with King Boudewijn, whom he saw oftenB&L; 108. and whom he greatly admired.Witness his touching homily at King Boudewijn's funeral; M&S; 371. =Synods= Danneels participated in a number of synods of bishopsThe English version of their names and subjects follows the Holy See Press Office's webpage Synod of Bishops and the webpages linked to it. and played a prominent role in some of them, notably in: Special Assembly for the Netherlands (14‚Äì31 January 1980) Danneels chaired this synod, on \\"The Pastoral Situation in the Netherlands\\", , together with cardinal Johannes Willebrands. Its central task was to overcome the divisions that were plaguing the Catholic Church in the Netherlands and the widening gap between Rome and many Dutch Catholics. Its final document was signed by all participants, but it was poorly received in the Netherlands, and the conflicts between the Dutch bishops among themselves and between some of them and their flocks continued.M&S; 165‚Äì177. Fifth Ordinary General Assembly (26 September ‚Äì 25 October 1980) Its theme was \\"The Christian Family\\". In a speech (\\"My best synod speech ever\\") Danneels stressed the values that were the foundations of Humanae vitae, but called for objectively analyzing the reasons why so many Catholics refused its teachings, and pointed out that many divorced Catholics no longer saw how canon law could be reconciled with the demands of God's mercy. Toward the end of the synod, on 24 October, his prestige was such that he was elected a member of the general secretariat of the bishops' synods with 124 votes, outpolling even Cardinals Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger (121 votes) and Basil Hume (110 votes).M&S; 178‚Äì182; quote p. 178. Second Extraordinary General Assembly (25 November ‚Äì 8 December 1985) Devoted to \\"The Twentieth Anniversary of the Conclusion of the Second Vatican Council\\", its discussions revolved around the question \\"Shall we put the brakes on Vatican II, or shall we continue or even go beyond it?\\" Danneels was appointed its General Relator (rapporteur), and in this task he was assisted by Walter Kasper, then still a theology professor. Their final report was praised by the Pope and accepted almost unanimously.B&L; 101. But its conclusions could be, and were, interpreted in both directions, and it left many decisions up to Rome, thus putting no stop to the centralizing tendencies in the Church.M&S; 226‚Äì233. Special Assembly for Europe (1‚Äì23 October 1999) Its theme was \\"Jesus Christ, Alive in His Church, Source of Hope for Europe\\". Danneels' speech attacking the cultural pessimism prevalent among a number of Roman prelates impressed many council fathers as well as Pope John Paul II, who allowed him to go beyond the allotted time.M&S; 464. Third Extraordinary General Assembly (5‚Äì19 October 2014) This was popularly known as the \\"Synod on the Family\\"; officially it was about \\"Pastoral Challenges of the Family in the Context of Evangelization\\". Danneels' intervention was brief,\\"The home of mercy\\" is an English translation of his brief intervention. but his presence at the synod was notable, as it followed a personal invitation by Pope Francis.Cf. the \\"Full list of Participants\\" published by the Vatican Radio. =Danneels and liberation theology= Danneels was aware of the risks of liberation theology and its political dimension. But when on 6 August 1984, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith published Libertatis nuntius, its Instruction on Certain Aspects of the \\"Theology of Liberation\\" without even consulting him, though he was a member, he publicly denounced it in several interviews, for its procedure and, more importantly, for its overly intellectual approach of the concept of freedom, which failed to take seriously the pains caused by poverty and by political and military oppression. He was instrumental in preventing a condemnation of his friend Gustavo Guti√©rrez, and he was pleased that the follow-up of Libertatis nuntius, Libertatis conscientia, the Congregation's \\"Instruction of Christian Freedom and Liberation\\", did not proclaim a definitive condemnation of liberation theology.M&S;, ch. 8, especially pp. 194‚Äì199. =Danneels and the Belgian constitutional crisis over abortion= In March and April 1990, King Boudewijn's refusal to sign the law liberalizing abortion, drafted by Roger Lallemand and by Lucienne Herman-Michielsens and approved by Parliament, provoked a constitutional crisis. Both Danneels and Prime Minister Wilfried Martens had foreseen the King's refusal, and in the spring of 1989, Danneels had offered Martens to mediate in case of just such a crisis.Wilfried Martens De memoires: Luctor et emergo (Tielt: Lannoo, 2006; ; in Dutch), p. 484. Danneels had often discussed the moral dilemma the King faced, but denies mediating after the King's decision was taken.B&L; 107. The words of two Ministers of State, Philippe Moureaux and Mark Eyskens, have been interpreted as meaning that he did. But neither Moureaux [\\"On √©voquait une discr√®te et prudente intervention du cardinal\\" (A discreet and prudent intervention of the cardinal was recalled)] nor Eyskens [\\"Maar geen enkel resultaat\\" (But no result whatsoever)] say this in so many words.25 jaar abortuswet: Boudewijn onder druk, a 6 April 2015 video clip of a VTM newscast. They may just as well have alluded to the earlier talks between Danneels and the King. In a number of reactions to the VTM broadcast it has been claimed that Danneels counseled the King to sign the Lallemand‚ÄìHerman Michielsens law.VTM itself claims this in the text accompanying the clip on its website. However, whatever Danneels said in conversations with the King, before, during or after this constitutional crisis, he has always respected any \\"colloque singulier\\"The \\"colloque singulier\\" is a Belgian tradition \\"which means that the content of discussions with the King cannot be disclosed, in order to protect his position super partes\\". Definition from Patricia Popelier & Koen Lemmens The Constitution of Belgium: A Contextual Analysis (Oxford and Portland, Oregon: Hart, 2015; ), p. 146. he had with the King. Since King Boudewijn is dead, Danneels took the secret of what he told the King to his grave. The claim that he advised the King to sign is pure speculation. Danneels flatly denied he did: \\"Ik heb alvast nooit geprobeerd hem om te praten\\" (I certainly never tried to talk him [the King] round). Shortly after the law was published in the Belgian official journal, the Belgian bishops, including Danneels, issued a declaration in which they distinguished what is legally acceptable and what is morally desirable, and they unambiguously rejected the law morally.M&S; 297. Danneels has never wavered from the conviction that \\"a society that encourages abortion of those that are born in the margins of society or that do not have the chance to be loved abandons its humanizing role and ultimately condemns itself\\".A slightly free translation of a Danneels quote in M&S; 298. =Member of the group of Sankt Gallen= On 3 January 1999, Danneels became a member of St. Gallen Group, in which he was to play a prominent role.M&S;, the entire chapter 24. Date p. 463. =Danneels' view on homosexuality and same- sex marriage= Danneels always objected to discrimination against homosexuals and he was always in favor of a juridical statute for stable relations between partners of the same sex. He said as much on 11 April 2003 in a private letter to Guy Verhofstadt, whose government had approved this.M&S; 389. But he has always been opposed to calling such a statute \\"marriage\\". He repeated these views ten years later, in a newspaper interview in which he said:Translated from the interview in De Tijd, titled \\"'Ik heb geen zin te bewijzen dat ik een heilig man ben\\" (I don't feel like proving I am a holy man), 1 June, p. 52; French version in L'Echo =Danneels' view on euthanasia= Long before Belgium liberalized its law on euthanasia,\\"Law regarding Euthanasia\\", dated 28 May 2002, published 22 June 2002. in a press conference on 31 January 1994, Danneels gave voice to the Belgian bishops' opposition to the idea.M&S; 384. The issue resurfaced again, with a vengeance, in the spring of 2008, when famous Belgian author Hugo Claus chose euthanasia on 19 March and when three days later Danneels devoted his homily during the Easter Vigil to \\"the problem of suffering and death\\", without, however, mentioning Claus by name. Even so, this homily was widely interpreted as criticism of Claus' choice and heavily criticized.M&S; 401‚Äì404. But shortly afterwards, on 13 April 2008, Danneels doubled down in \\"Het Braambos\\", a broadcast of the \\"Katholieke Televisie- en Radio-Omroep\\" (Catholic Television and Radio Broadcasting Organization): =Ecumenical activities= From the beginning of his archbishopric, Danneels kept cultivating the good contacts between \\"Mechelen\\" and Anglicanism that were started by Cardinal Mercier in the 1920s.M&S; 161‚Äì164. Likewise from the beginning of his archbishopric, Danneels made almost yearly visits to the Taiz√© Community. He mediated with the Vatican to make Pope John Paul II's visit to Taiz√© on 5 October 1986 happen. He regularly met with Brother Roger, on whom the Catholic University bestowed an honorary doctorate in 1990. But after Brother Roger's death, too, he kept fostering relations with Taiz√©, and from 29 December 2008 through 2 January 200 he hosted the 31st European Taiz√© meeting in Brussels.M&S; 431‚Äì434. Danneels was a member of the World Council of Religions for Peace, on which he sat until 2004. Starting in the summer of 2002, he was also active in one of its projects, the European Council of Religious Leaders, in which he remained involved through the first decade of the 21st century.M&S; 437‚Äì446. =Diplomatic activities= Danneels was involved in the negotiations about the convent of the Carmelite nuns at Auschwitz after father Werenfried van Straaten had proposed, in 1985, to convert its temporary location in the former theater building into a full- fledged convent. Danneels involvement lasted until 1989, when Rome decided the issue and promised the nuns would move out.M&S;, ch. 11. (But they remained until 1993, and left behind the Auschwitz cross.)M&S; 246. Between 1990 and 1999, Danneels was the international president of Pax Christi.M&S; 328 & 437. Danneels was a consistent and strong supporter of bishop (later cardinal) Monsengwo's attempts to foster democracy in Zaire, mediating between Belgium, Rome and Kinshasa. He was instrumental in Monsengwo's being awarded an honorary doctorate by the Catholic University of Leuven on 2 February 1993 and he gave the Laudatio himself.M&S; 372‚Äì380. Danneels worked long and hard to thaw the relations between China and the Catholic Church. In November 1985 he invited a delegation of official Chinese bishops, who had been invited to Leuven by the Catholic University, to lunch in his residence in Mechelen. A return invitation followed, but problems caused by the coexistence of the official and the underground Catholic Church in China led to Danneels having to postpone his visit. When it finally happened, in March 2005, Danneels had to cut it short, owing to the death of pope John Paul II on 2 April. But on 3 April the Chinese government issued a communiqu√© lauding Pope John Paul's efforts to recognize the Church's errors. Pope Benedict encouraged Danneels to continue his efforts and in March 2008 Danneels again went to China, where he addressed the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and where he was allowed to encounter a number of rural Catholic communities.M&S; 447‚Äì460. =Dealing with child sex abuse in the Belgian Church= Danneels was first confronted with the problem of sexual abuse in the Church in the aftermath of the Dutroux affair, when the authorities' call for victims of abuse to come forward revealed that there had also been cases of abuse in the Church.M&S; 407‚Äì408. (But see also the Vangheluwe affair, below.) The first to formally organize a contact point for victims of sexual abuse within the Belgian Church was Arthur Luysterman, the bishop of Ghent.M&S; 409. That contact point was the model of the \\"Commission for Complaints about Sexual Abuse in Pastoral Relations\\", which the conference of the Belgian bishops (chaired by Danneels) organized on 4 November 1999. Early in 1998 it became known that a priest of the archdiocese had raped a minor in 1968. Danneels volunteered to testify in court, the first time ever that a cardinal had appeared before a secular court in Belgium. Danneels said that he had known nothing about the abuse. The court held that the Catholic Church in Belgium‚Äînot the archbishop himself nor his auxiliary bishop‚Äîwas guilty of failing to protect the victim, was civilly responsible, and imposed a fine of half a million Belgian francs (now ¬± 12,500 ‚Ç¨). On appeal this verdict was quashed and only the abusive priest was held guilty.M&S; 410 On 6 December 1999 the authorities began proceedings against Robert Borremans; a priest of the archdiocese, well-known because he had been the choral conductor at the marriage of Philippe and Mathilde (now King and Queen). Danneels relieved him of his pastoral tasks and had him struck from the government's payroll.M& S 413. Belgian bishops and priests charged with pastoral care are paid by the government, an arrangement that continues the Concordat of 1801. Though convicted at first, Borremans was cleared in the end, when the allegations against him were found to be false.P. Neirinckx, \\"Priester Borremans niet schuldig aan verkrachting\\", Het Belang van Limburg 30 September 2011; also available here. Vangheluwe affair and its aftermath From 1973 to 1986, Roger Vangheluwe, a priest since 1963 and the Bishop of Bruges since early 1985, sexually abused a nephew of his. Rik Devill√©, a priest who had had a couple of conflicts with Danneels,M&S; 315‚Äì323, 405‚Äì406, 422. said, after the scandal broke on 23 April 2010, that he had warned Danneels about Vangheluwe in the mid-1990s. In 2010, Danneels said that he did not remember this.M&S; 484. But Danneels certainly knew about Vangheluwe's crime before the scandal broke because, in the beginning of April 2010, Vangheluwe had himself told Danneels that he had had a relationship with a minor. What Danneels did, or did not do, in the few weeks before the scandal broke, earned him a great deal of criticism, both at home and abroad. On 8 April, Vangheluwe pressured Danneels to accept a meeting with himself, his victim and the victim's relatives. At that meeting Danneels advised the victim to delay a public statement until Vangheluwe had retired. Speaking through a spokesman, Toon Osaer, Danneels explained that he had been unprepared for this meeting and that his proposal that the victim remain silent was \\"an improvisation\\".\\"Belgium: Cardinal Apologizes for Suggesting Temporary Cover-Up of Bishop's Abuse\\", by the Associated Press, New York Times, 31 August 2010. Danneels did not reveal this conversation to the Belgian bishops. At another meeting Vangheluwe, in Danneels' presence, made a private apology which the victim rejected. In the night of Monday 19 to Tuesday 20 April all Belgian bishops received an e-mail exposing Vangheluwe. This resulted in Vangheluwe's resignation on 22 April and its immediate acceptance by the Vatican on 23 April, as was revealed on the same date by Danneels' successor as archbishop, Andr√©-Mutien L√©onard, at a press conference. In a press communiqu√©, likewise on 23 April, Vangheluwe publicly admitted his guilt and publicly apologized.M&S; 482. In the weeks after Vangheluwe's resignation, the \\"Commission for Complaints about Sexual Abuse in Pastoral Relations\\" (now often called the Adriaenssens Commission, after its chairman, child psychiatrist Peter Adriaenssens) received no fewer than 475 complaints about sexual abuse. On 24 June, in an operation code named Kelk (\\"Chalice\\") organized at the request of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, the archiepiscopal palace, Danneels' private apartment, the Leuven seat of the Adriaenssens Commission and even St. Rumbold's Cathedral (where the graves of Cardinal Mercier and Cardinal Suenens were broken into) were simultaneously searched for documents about cases of sexual abuse that could still be prosecuted (unlike that of Vangheluwe, beyond the statute of limitation).M&S; 487‚Äì488. On 6 July, Danneels was subjected to an all-day interrogation by the Brussels branch of the Judicial Police.M&S; 488. Later the search was judged to have been illegal and all documents seized were returned.M&S; 493. Great damage to Danneels‚Äôs reputation was caused by the publication in De Standaard and Het Nieuwsblad on 28 August 2010 of the transcript of tape recordings, made secretly, of the two meetings Danneels had had with the victim and his family. The transcripts revealed that the victim felt that he was not being understood and considered Danneels' manner to be inept.M&S; 489. For Danneels, the final chapter of the affair was his appearance, on 21 December 2010, before a parliamentary committee investigating sexual abuse in hierarchical relations. He emphatically stated that there had never been a policy of covering up or denying, let alone tolerating sexual abuse, that justice had to be done and that the Church must cooperate.M&S; 491‚Äì492. But even if that is accepted, Danneels was widely reproached for inaction in a matter in which the public expected him to be decisive. As an editorial in De Standaard of 1 September 2010 put it: \\"For days he kept the shock of Vangheluwe's confession to himself. He did not contact the ex-bishop again to convince him of what was inevitable: his immediate resignation. He did not refer the matter to the Adriaenssens Commission. And he did not involve his own successor, archbishop L√©onard.\\" Papal Conclave of 2005 Upon the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Danneels was listed as a possible successor (or papabile) although with weakened credentials due to the fact that he was an archbishop of a country where abortion, euthanasia and same-sex unions had recently been legalized and where, under his watch, church attendance and pastoral vocations have dropped to historical lows.Catholic Culture.org: \\"Decline of Catholicism in Belgium \\"troubling,\\" Pope says\\" 23 November 2003National Catholic Reporter: \\"Belgium a 'perfect storm' on sex abuse crisis\\" 28 June 2010 Danneels participated in the 2005 papal conclave. The pre-conclave discussions pointed out the direction which the conclave was to take.M&S; 472. It elected Pope Benedict XVI. In a TV interview directly after this election, which he had promised‚Äî\\"foolishly\\", he said, because keeping this promise prevented him from attending the dinner with the pope and the other cardinals, and because he was tired‚Äîhis body language indicated he was not enthusiastic, which was widely interpreted as indicating he was an opponent of the new pope. Danneels denies this: \\"That is not true, but I'll have to bear that charge until I die.\\"B&L; 125. Retirement and succession On 4 June 2008, Danneels reached the mandatory age of retirement; his succession took time and did not go smoothly. The three names on the terna (list of three) of possible successors Karl-Josef Rauber, the papal nuncio, sent to Rome, were rejected, and so were the names on a second terna Rauber sent. It was not until 18 January 2010 that Rome imposed its own candidate and replaced Danneels as Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels by Andr√©-Mutien L√©onard, whom Rauber openly said \\"non era 'del tutto adatto' per Bruxelles\\" (was not totally suitable for Brussels).Sandro Magister \\"'De bello germanico'. Ex nunzio tedesco vuota il sacco contro il papa\\" in L'Espresso, 2 March 2010, also available here. In Italian. Papal Conclave of 2013 Danneels was not considered \\"papabile\\" before the 2013 conclave, in which he participated. Naturally he also participated in the cardinals' pre-conclave discussions, which he called \\"the most interesting discussions in all my life as cardinal\\", as they were far more open than those preceding the 2005 conclave,M&S; 497. and as their main theme was the need for collegiality.Ivereigh 353. The conclave elected Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio (whom Danneels, as a member of the St. Gallen Group, supported). The newly elected pope Francis invited Danneels to appear with him on the balcony when he first appeared after the Habemus Papam.M&S; 500. At Pope Francis' inauguration, Danneels pronounced the formal prayer for the new pope in the absence of the protopriest, Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns.. He later described the result of this conclave as \\"een persoonlijke verrijzeniservaring\\" (a personal resurrection experience).M&S; 501. Death Danneels died on 14 March 2019 in Mechelen. His funeral services, with the King, Queen, other members of the Royal family and numerous politicians attending, were held on 22 March 2019 in St. Rumbold's Cathedral in Mechelen, where he was buried in the crypt of the cathedral.Gelovigen groeten lichaam kardinaal Danneels in MechelenAfscheid van kardinaal Danneels: belangrijke politici, academici en koninklijke familie wonen dienst bij Honors * Danneels was awarded honorary doctorates by the Catholic University of Tilburg (2 September 2002)Date announced in De Standaard of 5 February 2002; also available here. and by Georgetown University (3 March 2003).Date in De Standaard of 3 March 2003; also available here. * On 20 December 2003 Danneels won the \\"Castar\\", an award bestowed by CAnvas, De STAndaard and Radio 1 on \\"the man or the woman whose cultural, social, political or socio-economic contributions have been positive and remarkable.\\"A somewhat free translation of the very awkward phrasing with which the award was bestowed, quoted in M&S; 476\\\\.

The phenomenon is described as a psychological crisis brought about by events that highlight a person's growing age, inevitable mortality, and possibly lack of accomplishments in life. This may produce feelings of intense depression, remorse, and high levels of anxiety, or the desire to achieve youthfulness or make drastic changes to their current lifestyle or feel the wish to change past decisions and events. The term was coined by Elliott Jaques in 1965. More modern research has shown this is not a phase that most middle-aged people actually experience, and some have questioned the existence of this phenomenon. Crisis vs. stressors Academic research since the 1980s rejects the notion of mid-life crisis as a phase that most adults go through. Personality type and a history of psychological crisis are believed to predispose some people to this \\"traditional\\" midlife crisis. People going through this suffer a variety of symptoms and exhibit a disparate range of behaviors. It is important to understand the difference between a mid-life crisis and a mid-life stressor. Mid-life is the time from years 45‚Äì64 where a person is often evaluating his or her own life. However, many mid-life stressors are often labeled as a mid-life crisis. Day-to-day stressors are likely to add up and be thought of as a crisis, but in reality, it is simply an \\"overload\\". Both women and men often experience multiple stressors because of their simultaneous roles as spouses, parents, employees, children, etc. Many middle-aged adults experience major life events that can cause a period of psychological stress or depression, such as the death of a loved one, or a career setback. However, those events could have happened earlier or later in life, making them a \\"crisis,\\" but not necessarily a mid-life one. In the same study, 15% of middle-aged adults experienced this type of midlife turmoil. Being of a lower educational status is related to feeling stressors to a greater degree than those of a higher education level during midlife. Studies indicate that some cultures may be more sensitive to this phenomenon than others; one study found that there is little evidence that people undergo midlife crises in Japanese and Indian cultures, raising the question of whether a mid-life crisis is mainly a cultural construct. The authors hypothesized that the \\"culture of youth\\" in Western societies accounts for the popularity of the mid-life crisis concept there. Researchers have found that mid-life is often a time for reflection and reassessment, but this is not always accompanied by the psychological upheaval popularly associated with \\"mid-life crisis.\\"Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version (W. W. Norton, 1998), Those who made career or jobs changes early in life were less likely to experience a crisis in midlife. Occurrence The condition may occur from the ages of 45‚Äì64. Mid-life crises last about 3‚Äì10 years in men and 2‚Äì5 years in women. A mid-life crisis could be caused by aging itself, or aging in combination with changes, problems, or regrets over: *work or career (or lack of them) *spousal relationships (or lack of them) *maturation of children (or lack of children) *aging or death of parents *physical changes associated with aging Mid-life crisis can affect men and women differently because their stressors differ. An American cultural stereotype of a man going through a midlife crisis may include the purchase of a luxury item such as an exotic car, or seeking intimacy with a younger woman. Some men seek younger women who are able to procreate, not necessarily with an intention to produce offspring. A man's midlife crisis is more likely to be caused by work issues, a woman's crisis by personal evaluations of their roles. Even though there are differences between why men and women go through a midlife crisis, the emotions they both encounter can be intense. One of the main characteristics of a mid-life crisis perspective, is one assumes that their mid-life is about to be eventful, usually in a negative way, and potentially stressful. Psychologist Oliver Robinson's research characterizes each decade of life by describing frequent occurrences or situations particular to those age periods. He describes that a crisis can begin in a person's early 20s, when they usually try to map out their whole life. Moreover, the later age period, between 50 and 60, may be a time of illness or even the thought of death. Such a deadline may convince a middle-aged person that their life needs to be lived as expected. Individuals experiencing a mid- life crisis may feel: *a deep sense of remorse for goals that have not been accomplished *a fear of humiliation among more successful colleagues *longing to achieve a feeling of youthfulness *need to spend more time alone or with certain peers *a heightened sense of their sexuality or lack of it * ennui, confusion, resentment or anger due to their discontent with their marital, work, health, economic, or social status *ambition to right the missteps they feel they have taken early in life Treatment and prevention Physical changes that commonly occur during these years are weight gain, wrinkles, sagging skin, hair loss.MedlinePlus. Minaker, K. L., Dugdale, D. C., III MD, & Zieve, D., MD. (2011) Regular exercise and maintenance of a nutritious diet may help to sustain one's physical and mental health during these years of transition. Significant changes made early in life may prevent one from having a mid-life crisis. An example supporting such a theory can be derived from the research conducted by Dr. Susan Krauss Whitbourne. People who changed jobs before their midlife years had a greater sense of generativity when they reached mid-life. They also experienced a greater sense of motivation to deviate from stagnation and a desire to help the younger generation thrive. This is a psychological stage proposed by Erik Erikson that describes a normal stage adults go through during their mid-life years.  Theoretical basis  The notion of the mid-life crisis began with followers of Sigmund Freud, who thought that during middle age everyone‚Äôs thoughts were driven by the fear of impending death.Scientific American MIND Magazine February 2009 article titled \\"Ask the Brains: Is the Midlife Crisis a Myth?\\" by David Almeida, professor of human development and family studies at Pennsylvania State University Although mid-life crisis has lately received more attention in popular culture than serious research, there are some theoretical constructs supporting the notion. Jungian theory holds that mid-life is key to individuation, a process of self- actualization and self-awareness that contains many potential paradoxes. Although Carl Jung did not describe midlife crisis per se, the mid-life integration of thinking, sensation, feeling, and intuition that he describes could, it seems, lead to confusion about one's life and goals. Erik Erikson's life stage of generativity versus stagnation also coincides with the idea of a mid-life crisis. Erikson believed that in this stage adults begin to understand the pressure of being committed to improving the lives of generations to come. In this stage a person realizes the inevitability of mortality and the virtue of this stage is the creating of a better world for future generations in order for the human race to grow. Stagnation is the lack of psychological movement or growth. Instead of helping the community a person is barely able to help their own family. Those who experience stagnation do not invest in the growth of themselves or others. Some psychologists believe men's mid-life crisis is a psychological reaction to the imminent menopause and end of reproductive career of their spouses. Their genes may be influencing men to be more attracted to reproductive women, and less attached to their non-reproductive spouses. Criticism Some people have challenged the existence of mid-life crises altogether. One study found that 23% of participants had what they called a \\"midlife crisis,\\" but in digging deeper, only one-third of those‚Äî8% of the total‚Äîsaid the crisis was associated with awareness of aging. The balance (15% of those surveyed) had experienced major life experiences or transitions such as divorce or loss of a job in middle age and described them as \\"midlife crisis\\". While there is no doubt these events can be traumatic‚Äîthe associated grief reactions can be indistinguishable from depression. Costa and McCrae (1980) found little evidence for an increase in neuroticism in midlife. While they did find that some people were likely to experience such crises, these individuals were likely to experience crises in their 20s and 30s, and these experiences were not unique to midlife. Robinson, Rosenberg, and Farrell (1999) re-interviewed (500) men. Looking back over their midlife period, it became evident that while not necessarily entailing crisis, it was a time for re-evaluation. Wrapping up their review of men's mid-life crisis, Alwin and Levenson wrote that \\"... Given the bulk of the data, it is likely that, for most men, mid-life is a time of achievement and satisfaction. For a certain proportion of men, however, the passage is not at all smooth.\\" They found a similar pattern when they reviewed research on what are commonly thought to be triggers for women's mid-life crisis: menopause, children leaving home, the \\"sandwich\\" of caring for both parents and children. Most women navigated those periods without a traumatic psychological \\"crisis\\". The enduring popularity of the mid-life crisis concept may be explained by another finding by Robinson et al. As Alwin and Levenson summarize: \\"... younger men, now middle-aged Baby Boomers, used the term \\"midlife crisis\\" to describe nearly any setback, either in their career or family life.\\" Levenson researched the possible existence of a midlife crisis and its implications. Whereas Levenson (1978) found that 80% of middle-aged participants had a crisis, and Ciernia (1985) reported that 70% of men in midlife said they had a crisis (Shek, 1996) others could not replicate those findings including Shek (1996), Kruger (1994), McCrae and Costa (1990). The debate of whether or not there is a midlife crisis is being answered through recent research that attempts to balance such factors as response bias and experimenter effects in order to establish internal validity. The above mentioned research does not support Levenson's model of a single age in the middle years that is a designated time of transition and potential \\"crisis\\". Instead, changes in personality can occur throughout the adult years with no peak in general distress or psychosocial crisis. Many view mid-life as a negative, but in reality many experience this time positively. If looked at as a time of personal growth, the experience can be greatly beneficial and rewarding. If treated as a transitional phase, psychologists believe the initial experience may be difficult and confusing but as time passes it becomes an experience of self growth and self-realization.Erikson, Erik H.

A number of derived words exist, usually tied to a particular usage or building type. Some may be archaic or in lesser use now. Examples of such words are: courtyard, barnyard, hopyard, graveyard, churchyard, brickyard, prison yard, railyard, junkyard and stableyard. Word origin The word \\"yard\\" came from the Anglo-Saxon geard, compare \\"jardin\\" (French) which has a Germanic origin (compare Franconian word \\"gardo\\"), \\"garden\\" (German Garten) and [Old Norse gar√∞r, Latin hortus = \\"garden\\" (hence horticulture and orchard), from Greek œáŒøœÅœÑŒøœÇ (chortos) = \\"farm-yard\\", \\"feeding-place\\", \\"fodder\\", (from which \\"hay\\" originally as grown in an enclosed field). \\"Girdle,\\" and \\"court\\" are other related words from the same root. Portable cattle yardsIn areas where farming is an important part of life, a yard is also a piece of enclosed land for farm animals or other agricultural purpose, often referred to as a cattleyard, sheepyard, stockyard, etc. In Australia portable or mobile yards are sets of transportable steel panels used to build temporary stockyards.Livestock Handling Made Easy, Arrow Farmquip, 2008. Application of the term  In North America and Australasia today, a yard can be any part of a property surrounding or associated with a house or other residential structure, usually (although not necessarily) separate from a garden (where plant maintenance is more formalized). A yard will typically consist mostly of lawn or play area. The yard in front of a house is referred to as a front yard, the area at the rear is known as a backyard. Backyards are generally more private and are thus a more common location for recreation. Yard size varies with population density. In urban centres, many houses have very small or even no yards at all. In the suburbs, yards are generally much larger and have room for such amenities as a patio, a playplace for children, or a swimming pool. In British English, these areas would usually be described as a garden, similarly subdivided into a front garden and a back garden, although paved areas may be called a yard, but more usually a patio. In modern Britain, the term yard is often used for depots and land adjacent to or among workplace buildings, as well as uncultivated land adjoining a building. In North America, the term \\"garden\\" refers only to the area that contains plots of vegetables, herbs, flowers, and/or ornamental plants; and the term \\"yard\\" does not refer to the \\"garden\\", although the flower garden or vegetable garden may be within the yard.

More recently, these have been replaced by outdoor entertainments such as a barbecue and swimming pool. But, since the 1990s, the trend in Australian suburban development has been for back yards to disappear as the dwellings now occupy almost all of the building plot. In higher latitudes, it is economical in low land value regions to use open land surrounding a house for vegetable gardening during summers and allow sunlight to enter house windows from a low horizon angle during winters. As land value increases, houses are built nearer to each other. In order to preserve some of the open land, house owners may choose to allow construction on the side land of their houses, but not build in front of or behind their house in order to preserve some remnants of open surrounding land.

While railways have a great ability to haul very heavy loads, this advantage is only significant when the tracks are fairly level. As soon as the gradients increase, the tonnage that can be hauled is greatly diminished.  History  Early tramways and railways were laid out with very gentle grades because locomotive and horse haulage were so low in tractive effort. The only exception would be with a line that was downhill all the way for loaded traffic. Brakes were very primitive at this early stage. Where a railway has to cross a range of mountains, it is important to lower the summit as much as possible, as this reduces the steepness of the gradients on either side. This can be done 1990s with a summit tunnel or a deep summit cutting. A summit tunnel can lower the summit even more, and steeper hills result in shorter tunnels. Also, tunnels cost the same no matter how much overburden there is, while cuttings tend to increase in cost with the square of the overburden. Care had to be taken with summit tunnels in the early days of steam with designs that suffered from problems with smoke and slippery rail.  Ruling gradient  The ruling gradient of a section of railway line between two major stations is the gradient of the steepest stretch. The ruling gradient governs the tonnage of the load that the locomotive can haul reliably.  Techniques to overcome steep hills  Some of the techniques that can be used to overcome steep hills include: * dividing the load or splitting the train, which requires a siding at the summit. * attaching additional banking engine(s). * Using multiple units to divide the load on tractive wheels. * replacing the engine with a more powerful heavier engine for the duration of the steep grade. * strengthening the track on or approaching the steep grade, allowing higher speeds, and allowing the train a run at the gradient. This can be used in short underwater tunnels, where there is a steep descent just before the climb. * using two-in-one articulated locomotives such as the Fairlie, Garratt or Mallet locomotive. * using a booster engine, though this is usually limited to starting the heavy train. * Zig zags * Spirals * Horseshoe curves * Rack railway * Fell mountain railway system * Elevators, cable railways, or funicular railways driven by stationary engines (cable haulage up and down inclines). * Geared steam locomotives such as a Shay locomotive * Atmospheric railway * Cable car (railway) * Rail surface treatment * Compensation for curvature - the gradient is slightly eased on sharpest curves so that the tractive effort to pull the train is uniform.  Examples  = Liverpool and Manchester Railway = The pioneering Liverpool and Manchester Railway was built at a time when choice between locomotive and cable haulable was not clear cut. Therefore, all hill climbing (1 in 100) sections was concentrated in one place where cable haulage by stationary engines could be used if necessary, while the rest of the line was engineered to be so gently graded (say 1 in 2000) that even primitive locomotives would have a chance of succeeding. As it turned out at the Rainhill Trials of 1829, locomotives proved capable of handling the short 1.6-km length of 1 in 100 gradients on either side of the Rainhill level. Since the early trains had primitive brakes, it was also necessary to have very gentle gradients to reduce the need for strong brakes.

Early life  Blair was born at the Barambah Aboriginal Reserve at Cherbourg, from Murgon in Queensland. His mother was Esther Quinn, a teenage Aboriginal woman. His surname, Blair, came from the family that had \\"adopted\\" his mother. He and his mother then went to the Salvation Army Purga Mission near Ipswich. His mother entered domestic service, leaving Harold, then aged two, at the mission, where he received an elementary education. Blair left school at age 16, gaining employment as a farm labourer. At the age of 17, he was working as a tractor driver at the Fairymead Sugar Mill. Communist trade union organiser Harry Green heard him singing and encouraged him to further his singing. Blair entered a radio amateur hour talent quest in early 1945, and attracted a record tally of listeners' votes. A group of trade unionists, academics and musicians formed a trust to sponsor his career.  Singing career  He entered the Melba Conservatorium in Melbourne in 1945 and earned a Diploma of Music with honours in 1949.Message Stick In 1950, Blair was invited to study in the United States by the noted African-American singer Todd Duncan. Blair studied at the Juilliard School, New York. While in New York he sang in a church in Harlem, and entered into the community life. He was impressed how people of all races participated at all levels of society. In 1951, the Australian Broadcasting Commission offered Blair a three-year singing contract, commencing with an extensive tour. By the end of the tour he had lost his voice. Breaking the contract, he was prohibited from singing professionally for three years. Discouraged, Blair sought other work including working for a hardware store. He expressed an interest in education and was taken on as a teacher at Ringwood Technical School. He later became a teacher at the Conservatorium in Melbourne, and served on the Aboriginal Arts BoardAboriginal Arts Board, Press Statement No. 83  Aboriginal activism  Blair continued to act for Aboriginal rights all his life. He joined the Aborigines Advancement League in its early days and later the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Watching an Aboriginal marching girls group at Moomba in 1962 led Blair to establish the Aboriginal Children's Holiday Project, and he was an early member of the Aborigines Welfare Board in Victoria. He stood as a candidate for the Australian Labor Party for a seat in the Victorian Parliament against the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.  Personal life  Blair married a fellow conservatorium singing student, Dorothy Eden, in 1949, and they had two children, Nerida and Warren. The marriage encountered some hostility at the time, as it involved the marriage of an Aboriginal man to a European woman. He now has three grandchildren.

This Injil is described by the Qur'an as one of the four Islamic holy books which was revealed by Allah, the others being the Zabur (possibly the Psalms), the Tawrat (the Torah), and the Qur'an itself. The word Injil is also used in the Quran, the Hadith and early Muslim documents to refer to both a book and revelations made by Allah to Isa. Etymology The Arabic word Injil (ÿ•ŸÜÿ¨ŸäŸÑ) as found in Islamic texts, and now used also by Muslim non-Arabs and Arab non-Muslims, is derived from the Syriac Aramaic word awongaleeyoon (‹ê‹ò‹¢‹ì‹†‹ù‹ò‹¢) found in the Peshitta (Syriac translation of the Bible),Peshitta (Mark 1:1) - \\"Literal Aramaic idiomatic (Lit. Ar. id.) name: \\"Awon-galee-yoon,\\" or He Reveals.\\" which in turn derives from the Greek word euangelion ()Muhammad in world scriptures Abdul Haque Vidyarthi - 1997 \\"It is derived from the Greek term evangelion which means gospel, good news and happy tidings.\\" of the originally Greek language New Testament, where it means \\"good news\\" (from Greek \\"Œï·Ωê Œ±Œ≥Œ≥Œ≠ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ\\"; Old English \\"g≈çdspel\\"; Modern English \\"gospel\\", or \\"evangel\\" as an archaism, cf. e.g. Spanish \\"evangelio\\") The word Injil occurs twelve times in the Quran. Identification Muslim scholars have resisted identifying the Injil with the New Testament Gospels. Some have suggested the Injil may be the Gospel of Barnabas or Gospel of Thomas.Oliver Leaman The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia Taylor & Francis 2006 page 298 More commonly, Muslim scholars have argued that the Injil refers to a text now lost or hopelessly corrupted. For example, Abdullah Yusuf Ali wrote: Several verses in the Qur'an have been understood by non-Muslim scholars to be problematic to this view, such as: While Muslim scholars interpret this verse as God warning the Christians not to enforce the law contrary to the law sent by God, other scholars see it as affirming the preservation of the New Testament Gospels: Nature Regardless of scholarly disagreement, Muslims commonly believe that Injil refers to a true Gospel, bestowed upon Jesus by God. Many Muslims believe that the Injil was revealed by God to Jesus in a manner comparable to the way the Quran was revealed to Muhammad; as presumed from passages in the Quran stating the gospel was a received message, such as (tr. Pickthall): Muslims reject the view that Jesus or any other person wrote the Injil, instead crediting its authorship to God. Many Muslim scholars continue to believe that the Biblical Gospel has undergone alteration, that the words and the meaning of the words have been distorted, with some passages suppressed and others added. A key Islamic principle of oneness (Tawhid) and wholeness of God's divinity means that in their view it is impossible for Jesus to be God incarnate or the Son of God, and claims to the contrary within the Biblical Gospels must be due to later additions. Nevertheless, the Bible has been used by Muslims as an historical source.Camilla Adang Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Hebrew Bible: From Ibn Rabban to Ibn Hazm BRILL 1996 page 251 It is said in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): According to a hadith collected by al-Bukhari: See also * Biblical and Quranic narratives * Christianity and Islam * Islamic view of the Christian Bible * List of Christian terms in Arabic * Scrolls of Abraham References External links * A discussion of the Injil and some other scriptures Category:Islamic texts Category:Christianity and Islam Category:Bible ","title":"Gospel in Islam"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function H(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),o(l,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your wikitable ü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",I,[(t(!0),o(l,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(B,[["render",H]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/50.md","filePath":"drive/50.md"}'),D={name:"drive/50.md"},x=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,x as default};
