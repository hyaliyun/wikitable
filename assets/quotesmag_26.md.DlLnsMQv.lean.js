Housed within the Teen Murti House complex, it is an autonomous institution under the Indian Ministry of Culture, and was founded in 1964 after the death of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. It aims to foster academic research on modern and contemporary history. Nehru Memorial Museum and Library Ministry of Culture, 23 August 2011. Today, the Nehru Memorial Library is the world’s leading resource centre on India’s first prime minister. Its archives contain the bulk of Mahatma Gandhi's writings, as well as private papers of C. Rajagopalachari, B. C. Roy, Jayaprakash Narayan, Charan Singh, Sarojini Naidu and Rajkumari Amrit Kaur. In March 2010 it launched a digitization project of its archives, and by June 2011, 867,000 pages of manuscripts and 29,807 photographs had been scanned and 500,000 pages had been uploaded on the digital library website. Amongst noted publications of the NMML are Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru, Man of Destiny by Ruskin Bond, Nehru Anthology (1980) and Nehru Anthology. Nehru Memorial Museum & Library has over the years supported scholars and historians across India. Through its fellowship programme, the Nehru Memorial Fellowship, it has funded some of India’s best academics such as Chief Information Commissioner OP Kejriwal. It is also one of the best libraries in Delhi for the social sciences as it has a huge collection on labour related issues in the form of PhD dissertations, reports, books, journals and news papers.Nehru Memorial Museum & Library Archives of Indian Labour. On 26 April 2016 a dagger gifted to former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru by Saudi Arabia was stolen from the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library. Overview Teen Murti Bhavan, where the library functioned from 1966 to 1974 Nehru Memorial Museum and Library is known as Teen Murti Bhawan (sculptor: Leonard Jennings of Britain), after the three statues established in 1922 in honor of the three Indian princely states Jodhpur, Hyderabad and Mysore after their contribution in World War I by serving in the present day Gaza Strip, Israel, and Palestine. It was designed by Robert Tor Russell who also designed Connaught Place and a few parts of Janpath. Spread over 30 acres, its construction started in 1929 and took around one year to completion. It is a masterpiece of British and French architecture and woodwork. Initially knows as Flagstaff House, it was used by British forces as the residence of the Commander-in-Chief. After Independence, the house was taken over as the residence of Jawaharlal Nehru (1889–1964), first Prime Minister of India. After his death in 1964, it was decided that Teen Murti Bhawan should be converted into a museum and a library which would promote original research in modern Indian history with special reference to the Nehruvian era. Study of Jawaharlal Nehru, preserved within the museum Nehru Memorial Museum and Library Society was formed on 1 April 1966. Initially, the museum was set up in the eastern wing and the library in the western wing of the sprawling building, with Bal Ram Nanda as its founder- director, who also curated the museum and library for next 17 years. He received the Padma Vibhushan in 2003.BALRAM NANDA (1917-2010) Raj Bhavan (Sikkim), 1 June 2010 With the passage of time and the rapid growth of research material in the library, more space was required and an exclusive library building was constructed. It was formally inaugurated by President V. V. Giri in January 1974. However, the steady increase in the volume of material required for research further necessitated the construction of an annex building which was completed in 1989. The Centre for Contemporary Studies was set up in this building as a new unit in 1990. View of Rashtrapati Bhawan from the entrance porch of Teen Murti Bhawan To commemorate the Foundation Day of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, it organises an annual lecture on 1 April, called the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Foundation Day Lecture. Nehru Planetarium is also part of NMML. Much work is also happening in the field of connecting people with this place with special reference to children, who are considered to be closest to Jawaharlal Nehru's heart, earning the popular name 'Chacha Nehru'. The library also has an archive of the private correspondence between Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten, wife of Lord Mountbatten, but with limited access. The Centre for Contemporary Studies was set up as an advanced studies unit of NMML in 1990 and is housed in the Annexe building. NMML took over the charge of the Nehru Planetarium from the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund in 2005. From April 2015 to March 2016, the Museum received nearly 1.7 million visitors. Nehru Memorial digital library The collection of manuscripts, historical documents and other archival materials of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library were made available online, after the digitisation project, with the help of HCL Infosystems started in 2010. By May 2011, employing the Rs union Ministry of Culture funding of Rs. 10 crore, the project had digitized 50 collections of manuscripts, 834 interview transcripts, 29,802 photographs, over one lakh images of the newspaper Amrita Bazar Patrika (1905–1938). In all, the digitization will cover nine million documents and was to be completed by 2015. Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund The Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund (JNMF) was founded in New Delhi on 17 August 1964 under the Chairmanship of Dr S. Radhakrishnan, then President of India, with Indira Gandhi as its Secretary. The foundation awarded the Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowships since 1968 and Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowships for Post-graduate Studies in India and abroad, initiated by the Ministry of Human Resource Development since 1993. It organizes the Annual Nehru Memorial Lecture on the eve of Jawaharlal Nehru's birthday (14 November).

The declaration calls for more and immediate action to be undertaken to address the causes and adverse impacts of climate change. The Ambo Declaration, named after the village in Kiribati where parliament sits, was slated to be a non- legally-binding agreement between the nations to present at the larger international climate change summit, COP16 in Cancun, Mexico. The United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, who also attended the conference, chose not to be part of the declaration by taking Observer status. The purpose of the conference was to support the initiative of the President of Kiribati, Anote Tong, to hold a consultative forum between vulnerable states and their partners with a view of creating an enabling environment for multi-party negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The conference was a successor event to the Climate Vulnerable Forum first held in November 2009 in the Maldives, when eleven climate vulnerable countries signed the Bandos Island declaration pledging to show moral leadership and commence greening their economies by voluntarily committing to achieving carbon neutrality. Based on the lessons learned in the COP process, the TCCC proposed a more inclusive format of consultations, involving key partners among major developed and developing nations. The ultimate objective of TCCC was to reduce the number and intensity of various fault lines between parties to the COP process, explore elements of agreement between the parties and thereby to support Kiribati's and other parties' contribution to COP16 to be held in Cancun, Mexico, from 29 November to 10 December 2010.

He was also a chancery clerk and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1661. Life Marsham was second son of Thomas Marsham, alderman of London, by Magdalen, daughter of Richard Springham, a London merchant. After attending Westminster School he matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 22 October 1619; he graduated B.A. on 17 February 1623, M.A. on 5 July 1625. He spent the winter of 1625 in Paris. In 1626 and 1627 he travelled in France, Italy, and Germany, and then returned to London, where he became a member of the Middle Temple in 1627. In 1629 he went through Holland and Gelderland to the siege of 's-Hertogenbosch in Brabant; and then by Flushing to Boulogne and Paris in the retinue of Sir Thomas Edmondes, ambassador extraordinary at the court of Louis XIII. Marsham was made one of the six clerks in chancery on 15 February 1638. On the outbreak of the First English Civil War he followed the king to Oxford, and was consequently deprived of his place by Parliament. After the surrender of Oxford he returned to London (1646), and having compounded for his estate, he lived in retirement at his seat of Whorn Place, in the parish of Cuxton, Kent. In April 1660, Marsham was elected a Member of Parliament (MP) for Rochester in the Convention Parliament.History of Parliament Online - Marsham John At the Restoration, he was restored to his place in chancery, and was knighted. On 12 August 1663 he was created a baronet. He was allowed to hand over his clerkship to his son Robert on 20 October 1680. Marsham died at Bushey Hall, Hertfordshire, on 25 May 1685, and was buried in Cuxton Church. By Elizabeth (1612–1689), daughter of Sir William Hammond of St. Albans Court in Nonington, Kent, he had two sons, John and Robert, and a daughter Elizabeth. He was succeeded initially by the eldest son John, who purchased the Mote in Maidstone and who died in 1692 when High Sheriff of Kent, but when John's own son John died young the baronetcy and Mote estate reverted to Robert. Works Marsham had a reputation in his day for his knowledge of history, chronology, and languages. According to Wotton, Marsham was the first who made Egyptian antiquities intelligible. Hallam also commended his work. He wrote Diatriba Chronologica, London, 1649, a dissertation in which he examined difficulties in the chronology of the Old Testament. Most of it was afterwards inserted in his more elaborate Chronicus Canon Ægypticus, Ebraicus, Græcus, et disquisitiones, London, 1672, a beautifully printed book (other editions, 4to, Leipzig, 1676, and 4to, Franeker, 1699, but both inaccurate). He wrote also the preface to the first volume of Roger Dodsworth and William Dugdale's Monasticon Anglicanum (1655), which is entitled Propylaion Johannis Marshami; it is a complex survey of English monasticism.David C. Douglas, English Scholars (1939), p. 42. He left unfinished Canonis Chronici liber quintus: sive Imperium Persicum, De Provinciis et Legionibus Romanis, De re nummaria, and other treatises.

The nature and the physiology of the phenomena were described independently by the British anatomical scientist Sir Charles Bell and the French physiologist François Magendie, later confirmed by the German physiologist Johannes Peter Müller. François MagendieCharles BellJohannes Peter Müller History The findings were described independently by two professors working in different medical paradigms: by Sir Charles Bell an anatomist and Francois Magendie – a pathophysiology and physiology professor . Their independent observations were 11 years apart. Another definitive experimental proof was given nine years after Magendie's experiments by Johannes Peter Müller during a vivisection of a frog in 1831. =Bell's discovery= In 1811 in a self-sponsored and published pamphlet Charles Bell referred to the motor functions of nerve fibers exiting the ventral roots of the spinal cord but did not mention the sensory functions of the dorsal roots. That was in part because his studies were dissectionist and not vivisectionist; pain is elicited and detected best in a conscious animal. A dead, or rendered unconscious, animal would not produce the desired effect when posterior horn fibers, responsible for sensation and transfer of noxious signals, are stimulated. Bell's nephew, John Shaw travelled in 1812 to Paris where he presented Bell's system to the French anatomists. Reportedly Shaw staged a demonstration on the facial nerves of a donkey without the intended effect. =Magendie's puppies experiment= Eleven years later, Magendie announced in the magazine Journal de physiologie expérimentale et de pathologie his discovery that the motor neuron fibers exit from the anterior root and the sensory neuron fibers from the dorsal root: \\"(trans)section of the dorsal root abolishes sensation, (trans)section of ventral roots abolishes motor activity, and (trans)section of both roots abolishes both sensation and motor activity.\\" Magendie gave the first complete description of the experimental proof of the Bell–Magendie law. His experiments were public, often conducted in the presence of medical students and curious citizens. That particular experiment was conducted by severing the anterior and posterior roots of spinal nerves in different combinations of several dogs in a litter of puppies. Stimulation of the posterior roots caused pain, and stimulation of the anterior – movement. The experiment was criticized for its cruelty by the Paris and London Humane societies. Detailed description of the experiment was published in the same magazine for physiology and pathology. =Müller's frog experiment= The third scientist, not credited in the name of the law, was the German physician and physiologist Johannes Peter Müller; he carried out neuroanatomical and physiological experiments on rabbits for quite some time and without success . Then he decided to simplify his experiments, and thus analysis, by reducing the object of the study to a less complex nervous system – that of a frog. He was assisted by then student and later famous German physiologist and anatomist Theodor Schwann. Theodor Schwann Because the frog spinal cord is relatively simple and easy to remove, and the relationships between the nerve roots are more apparent, Müller could simplify his design, which also resulted in better reproducibility of the experiment. His experiment involved innervations of the hind legs of the frog. One procedure involved first severing the posterior roots of the spinal nerve leading to the leg, with the result that the leg became insensible but not paralyzed. The second part of his experiment involved severing the anterior roots, so that the limb became paralyzed but not insensible. Müller's frog experiment became a physiology professor's favorite – it was an easily reproducible experiment, and has been used widely in teaching neurophysiology. The naming controversy The dispute of the findings, and subsequently the naming of the discovery, started with the publication of Magendie's paper in the Journal de physiologie expérimentale et de pathologie. The conflict lasted until Bell's death in 1842. Some science historians have better resolved to name it after both physicians, giving Bell the honorary first mention, although others have claimed that these are essentially two overlapping discoveries. Because of the independent findings of both scientists (Bell's claim over the motor function and Magendie's over the sensory function) and the existing conflict between England and France on the political arena of the 19th century (and prior to that), the debate on the Bell–Magendie law became a matter of national pride. The English medicine professors, especially Bell, and even English politicians rebuked the \\"crude methods\\" of the French vivisectionist. English medical staff and faculty were more tuned into seeking anatomical and structural explanations through dissections – taking a sort of medical functionalist approach. The dispute between the two happened in an era of a more secular approach to scientific discovery; positivism had become popular in many sciences. That was at about the same time as the works and theories of Auguste Comte were published. On the other hand, Magendie was considering himself in his own words \\"a mere scavenger of science trying to do science by collecting bits and pieces of nature's truths\\"; he was not after the grand scheme but after the \\"inventory of the nuts and bolts of the system\\".Science Quotes by François Magendie The French were also proud with Magendie's many discoveries and the extension of human knowledge in the areas of pathology, physiology and pharmacology and stood firmly behind his claim on the matter. Nevertheless, many Frenchmen (and most of our contemporaries) would have agreed with the English that the vivisections were not for the faint of heart. Until his death in 1842, Bell would write against the methods of Magendie and in his letters and books he would disapprove of the \\"protracted cruelty of the dissection experiments\\" . Exceptions The unmyelinated Group C nerve fibers that transmit pain and temperature from the pelvic viscera enter the spinal cord via ventral roots at L5-S3, thus violating the Bell–Magendie law.

For the first time worldwide, Solarlite is using direct steam generation commercially in a power plant. In 2012, Solarlite declared insolvency. The company was reincorporated the next year by Joachim Krüger (CEO).  Technology  Solar thermal facilities offer one of the most sustainable forms of energy recovery in terms of the environment, resources and availability. The technology has the advantage that as direct solar radiation increases, so does the efficiency of the facilities. The facilities are also characterized by a high degree of flexibility. They can be combined with all other fossil and renewable energy sources and are thus base-load capable. Another plus is the option of producing electricity and process heat at the same time or independently of one another. In addition, the residual heat can be used for further industrial applications for example desalination and cooling. Solarlite has tested the DSG concept successfully in three pilot projects in Thailand and Germany. The DSG concept is environment friendly and allows significant reductions of the total investment costs and levelized electricity cost. With DSG a higher operating temperature will be achievable. The Solarlite SL 4600 parabolic trough is a highly efficient product that can generate temperatures of up to 400 °C. Each panel has an aperture width of 4,6 m and is made of composite materials combined with an efficient thinglass mirror. This mirror reflects up to 95% of the sun's radiation onto the absorber pipe positioned at the ideal focus of the parabolic mirror.  Bankruptcy  In 2012, Solarlite was forced to declare insolvency. According to BonVenture, the reason for this \\"...was the unexpected market shift towards photovoltaics because of the Chinese government´s subsidies policy and the non-fulfilment of contractual obligations and payments by two customers\\".http://www.bonventure.de/en/projects/exits.html The company then reincorporated on January 1, 2013 as Solarlite CSP Technology GmbH with the same CEO, Joachim Krüger.https://seenews.com/companies/company_profile/solarlite-csp-technology- gmbh-355927  Projects  * \\"TSE 1\\" Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand - Completed in 2011, this was the first of what was originally planned to be 15 9MWe concentrated solar power plants. Thailand’s Solar Programme required that the plants be completed by 2015. However, due to complications, including Solarlite filing for bankruptcy in 2012, no other plants were built.http://newenergyupdate.com/csp-today/markets/solarlite-powering- southeast-asian-csp The 5 MWe solar thermal power plant located in Kanchanaburi/Thailand is unique in three different ways: 1). First parabolic trough commercial power plant based on direct steam generation; 2.) Solarlite Trough SL4600 a new generation of parabolic trough made of composite material combined with an efficient thin-glass mirror which reflects more than 95% of the sun radiation; 3.) The construction method allows island solutions and smaller solar thermal parabolic trough plants starting from 500 kWe. * DUKE, Spain * CompoSol * Solarlite, Duckwitz / DLR * TRESERT, Thailand * Woltow, Germanyhttp://www.solarlite.de/en/projects.cfm Direct steam generation Solarlite has tested the DSG concept successfully in three pilot projects in Thailand and Germany. Solarlite’s adaptation of DSG concept is based on the following advantages: * DSG concept is environment friendly and it avoids usage of flammable & environmental hazard materials * The DSG allows significant reductions of the total investment costs and levelized electricity cost. * With DSG a higher operating temperature will be achievable. * The DSG concepts has already acceptance at financial institutes, the first power plant was financed. Direct steam generation 2.0 Flow path concept, development and testing - In a joint research project known as “Duke” that was supported by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Solarlite CSP Technology GmbH and the German Aerospace Centre tested a new version of direct steam generation. Project aim * Investigation of the flow path concept under real conditions * Demonstration of solar direct steam generation at 500 °C * Detailed system analysis for debitable costing under consideration of the Solarlite collector SL 4600+ The Solarlite 4600 parabolic trough is a newly developed highly efficient product that can generate temperatures of up to 400 °C. Each panel has an aperture width of 4.6 m and is made of composite materials combined with an efficient thinglass mirror. This mirror reflects up to 95% of the sun’s radiation onto the receiver pipe positioned at the ideal focus of the parabolic mirror. Water passing through the receiver pipe is heated up by the concentrated reflected sun radiation and is converted into steam within a controlled process. A turbine generator produces electricity. Residual heat can be used for other applications such as seawater desalination or absorption cooling. The basic element of the Solarlite 4600 collector is the Solarlite composite panel which has a dimension of 2.3 m width and 1 m length. These panels are combined together to form 1 segment with a dimension 4.6 m aperture width and 12 m length. It is possible to connect 10 of these segments to form one collector thus reaching up to 120 m. These collectors are combined together to form rows (collectors aligned in 1 axis in the North-South direction) and loops (collectors connected in series where the cold fluid enters in one end and the hot fluids leaves in the other end). The collector is moved from east to west to track the sun by means of a hydraulic drive system. The modular concept of Solarlite allows choosing the optimal length of the collector based on the specific locations’ wind data. The combination of the light weight composite and slender steel structure allows having a reduced specific weight compared to the competitors.

Individuals experiencing sleep-wake inversion exchange diurnal habits for nocturnal habits, meaning they are active at night and sleep during the day. Sleep-wake inversion, when involuntary, can be a sign of a serious disorder.  Presentation  Individuals with the delayed sleep phase type of the disorder exhibit habitually late sleep hours and an inability to change their sleeping schedule consistently. They often show sleepiness during the desired wake period of their days. Their actual phase of sleep is normal. Once they fall asleep, they stay asleep for a normal period of time, albeit a period of time that starts and stops at an abnormally late time.  Causes  Sleep inversion may be a symptom of elevated blood ammonia levels and is often an early symptom of hepatic encephalopathy. Sleep inversion is a feature of African trypanosomiasis after which the disease takes its common name \\"African sleeping sickness\\"; sleep-wake cycle disturbances are the most common indication that the disease has reached the stage where infection spreads into the central nervous system.

In the 2010–11 season, he made his senior debut with farm team G.D. Ribeirão in the third division. In late January 2011, Alves was recalled by his parent club, making his Primeira Liga debut on 6 February by playing the last five minutes – and nearly scoring from a direct free kick – of a 0–1 away loss against FC Porto, which he had previously represented as a youth. He contributed with 239 minutes (three starts), as the Vila do Conde team retained their status. Alves was bought by Spanish club Atlético Madrid in July 2011.Atlético reportedly sign Júlio Alves; Atlético Fans, 6 July 2011 However, the following month, in the very last day of the summer transfer window, he moved teams – and countries – again, joining a host of compatriots at Beşiktaş JK,El extraño caso de Julio Regufe Alves (The strange case of Julio Regufe Alves); Marca, 31 August 2011 (in Spanish) including manager Carlos Carvalhal. On 24 August 2012, Alves signed for Sporting CP B on loan, playing the 2012–13 campaign in the second level. On 16 April of the following year, his contract was terminated for €200,000. Alves then returned to Rio Ave, but a registration error meant that neither he nor Ângelo Meneses could take part in Nuno Espírito Santo's team. In February 2016, in an interview to site Mais Futebol, he acknowledged that if his career was not better it was mainly due to personal problems and own mistakes. Alves returned to football after five years of inactivity, agreeing to a deal at C.D. Cerveira of the Portuguese third tier. International career Alves represented Portugal at the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup, only missing one match in seven as the nation finished in second place in Colombia. His only appearance with the under-21s occurred on 5 September of that year, when he came on as a late substitute in the 1–0 friendly defeat of France in Rio Maior. Personal life Alves' older brothers, Bruno and Geraldo, were also footballers. He had paternal Brazilian ancestry, his father Washington Geraldo Dias Alves having played ten years of his career in Portugal – mainly with Varzim – where his children were born.Bruno Alves: «Sinto grande orgulho no Geraldo e no Júlio» (Bruno Alves: «I am very proud of Geraldo and Júlio») ; Mais Futebol, 26 August 2011 (in Portuguese)La dinastía que une Brasil y Portugal (The dynasty that unites Brazil and Portugal) ; FIFA, 2 April 2014 (in Spanish) Their uncle, Geraldo Assoviador, also played the sport.

It includes advanced algorithms for image registration, segmentation, and quantitative morphological and functional image analysis. An IDE for graphical programming and rapid user interface prototyping is available. MeVisLab is written in C++ and uses the Qt framework for graphical user interfaces. It is available cross-platform on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. The software development is done in cooperation between MeVis Medical Solutions AG and Fraunhofer MEVIS. A freeware version of the MeVislab SDK is available (see Licensing). Open source modules are delivered as MeVisLab Public Sources in the SDK and available from the MeVisLab Community and Community Sources project. History MeVisLab development began in 1993 with the software ILAB1 of the CeVis Institute, written in C++. It allowed to interactively connect algorithms of the Image Vision Library (IL) on Silicon Graphics (SGI) to form image processing networks. In 1995, the newly founded MeVis Research GmbH (which became Fraunhofer MEVIS in 2009) took over the ILAB development and released ILAB2 and ILAB3. OpenInventor and Tcl scripting was integrated but both programs were still running on SGI only. In 2000, ILAB4 was released with the core rewritten in Objective-C for Windows. For being able to move away from the SGI platform, the Image Vision Library was substituted by the platform- independent, inhouse-developed MeVis Image Processing Library (ML). In 2002, the code was adapted to work on the application framework Qt. In 2004, the software was released under the name MeVisLab. It contained an improved IDE and was available on Windows and Linux. See the Release history for details. In 2007, MeVisLab has been acquired by MeVis Medical Solutions AG. Since then, MeVisLab has been continued as a collaborative project between the MeVis Medical Solutions and Fraunhofer MEVIS. Features Body center rendered in MeVisLab MeVisLab features include: * Image processing with the MeVis Image Processing Library (ML): The ML is a request-driven, page-based, modular, expandable C++ image processing library supporting up to six image dimensions (x, y, z, color, time, user dimensions). It offers a priority-controlled page cache and high performance for large data sets. * 2D image viewing: Fast, modular, extensible 2D viewers with combined 2D/3D rendering are implemented, supporting slab rendering (volume rendering/MIP), overlays, point/ROI selection, Multiplanar Reformations (MPR), as well as interactive editing of marker objects (points, vectors, discs, spheres, etc.) * Volume rendering: A high-quality volume renderer (Giga Voxel Renderer, GVR) based on OpenGL/Open Inventor is available.Link F, König M, Peitgen H-O; Multi-Resolution Volume Rendering with per Object Shading. In: Kobbelt L, Kuhlen T, Westermann R, eds. Vision Modelling and Visualization. Berlin, Aachen: Aka; 2006:185–191 It supports large image volumes (e.g., 512x512x2000 CT volumes, 12bit), time- varying data (e.g. dynamic MRI volumes), lookup tables, interactive region of interest, sub-volume selection, modular, multi-purpose GLSL shader framework.SoGVR Renderer Module Documentation * DICOM and other file formats: DICOM is supported via an import step that automatically recognizes series of 2D DICOM frames that belong to the same 3D/4D image volume. The data can be browsed with a configurable DICOM browser. DICOM storage to PACS is possible. Other supported file formats include TIFF (2D/3D, RGBA), Analyze, RAW, PNG, JPG, BMP, and more. * Tool frameworks: Modular class and module libraries for markers, curves, histograms, Winged-Edged Meshes (WEM) and Contour Segmentation Objects (CSO) are available. * Qt integration: Qt is used as application framework. The Qt API is integrated via PythonQt, allow to access Qt Style Sheets, Qt Widgets, QT Core classes, etc. by scripting from within MeVisLab. * Scripting support: Python can be used for script controlled access to a large part of the MeVisLab functionality. The script binding to Qt is implemented via PythonQt. For image processing via Python, NumPy is available. Object-oriented Python programming in MeVisLab is possible. * Integrated open source image processing and visualization libraries: Three open source libraries are integrated: Open Inventor, based on the original SGI source code released as open source in 2000; Insight Toolkit (ITK), made available as MeVisLab modules;Rexilius J, Jomier J, Spindler W, Link F, König M, Peitgen H-O; Combining a Visual Programming and Rapid Prototyping Platform with ITK.

Bellingham: SPIE, 2006: in pressVTK Module Reference * Comprehensive module library: The MeVisLab module library comprises a total of 2600 modules, including 800 standard modules and 1800 ITK/VTK modules. MeVisLab principles MeVisLab GUI MeVisLab is a modular development framework. Based on modules, networks can be created and applications can be built. To support the creation of image processing networks, MeVisLab offers an IDE that allows data-flow modelling by visual programming. Important IDE features are the multiple document interface (MDI), module and connection inspectors with docking ability, advanced search, scripting and debugging consoles, movie and screenshot generation and galleries, module testing and error handling support. In the visual network editor, modules can be added and combined to set up data flow and parameter synchronization. The resulting networks can be modified dynamically by scripts at runtime. Macro modules can be created to encapsulate subnetworks of modules, scripting functionality and high-level algorithms. On top of the networks, the medical application level with viewers and UI panels can be added. Panels are written in the MeVisLab Definition Language (MDL), can be scripted with Python or JavaScript and styled using MeVisLab-internal mechanisms or Qt features. The development of own modules written in C++ or Python is supported by wizards.

The younger son of King Stefan Milutin (1282-1321), he initially held the appanage of Zeta (with Zahumlje and Travunia), and was the heir to the Serbian throne after his father had exiled his elder brother Stefan. After his father's death, a throne struggle broke out between Konstantin, Stefan and their cousin Vladislav II, evolving into the two years long civil war. He was killed in the battle fighting his brother, who went on to defeat Vladislav, too, and gained the Serbian throne as Stefan Uroš III, better known as Stefan Dečanski. Life of Konstantin, who may even be canonized in Middle Ages, was obscured even in medieval chronicles while today is almost completely forgotten. Nearly all data on him are approximate and has to be extrapolated from other biographies. Apparently not much valued by his contemporaries, even by his own father who appointed him a successor only when had no other options, he met a cruel death by the hand of his own brother, losing the throne to which he lawfully succeeded.  Early life  Regarding Konstantin's personal data, the only confirmed information is that he was the son of king Milutin. His mother, birth date or even the birth sequence between him and his brother and sisters are unknown. This is the result of the missing timetable for a string of five marriages king Milutin had, which is among the largest problems in the Serbian medieval biographical research, as Serbian medieval chronologies and genealogies make no mention neither of Milutin's wives nor his daughters. By traditional historiography, Milutin married five times: 1) Jelena, Serbian noblewoman; 2) Helena, Greek noblewoman; 3) Elizabeth, Hungarian princess; 4) Anna, Bulgarian princess; 5) Simonis, Byzantine princess. Aleksa Ivić placed Konstantin as the youngest child of Milutin, while giving birth dates of c. 1274 for his brother Stefan Dečanski. This is in line with Stefan Dećanski's marriage date of 1299, or 1296 by the Bulgarian sources, to Bulgarian princess Teodora. Especially taking into the account that some sources claim he was already married previously to an unnamed woman, but the union was childless. Vladimir Ćorović claimed that Konstantin was the older son, while he considered Stefan Dečanski a child of Milutin's fourth wife Anna, who married the king in 1284.. As she was only 5 years old when married to Milutin, and was expelled by Milutin in 1299 when she was 19 or 20 years old, it is unlikely that she had (two) children with him, especially considering the dates from Stefan Dečanski's later life. According to the Serbian redaction of the Troitsky Manuscript, Milutin, Anna and \\"their children\\" were mentioned, however, in the original writings she is mentioned as the stepmother to Milutin's children. Bulgarian historian and cleric from the 14th and 15th century, Gregory Tsamblak, was adamant that the royal couple had no children. This leaves Konstantin as the younger son of Milutin. Ćorović also claims that Konstantin was Milutin's son from his first marriage, but as one of the reason why people sided with Stefan Dečanski during the war, he cited Stefan's fully Slavic origin, referring to his Bulgarian mother. However, Milutin's first wife, Jelena, was not only of Slavic, but of Serbian origin. This leaves Milutin's two foreign wives, Greek Helena and Hungarian Elizabeth, as possible mothers of Konstantin. Sometime in 1282 Milutin expelled his first wife Jelena and married Helena. He then expelled Helena, too, at the end of 1283, and married Elizabeth, who was expelled, too, before August 1284. Given these dates, Konstatin may be born in 1283 by Helena. Based on his appearance on the fresco in the Gračanica Monastery, which was built from 1315 to 1321, Ječmenica concluded that Konstantin may be born in the final years of the 13th century, since he appears to be \\"some twenty years old\\" on the painting. This contradicts Konstantin's 1303 appointment as the administrator of Nevesinje. However it is in line with some modern historians who partially reversed the timetable of Milutin's marriages and corresponding, assigned motherhood of his children, which makes possible for Elizabeth to be Konstantin's mother, but also moves her marriage to the 1290's and prolongs it for years.  Heir  As a prince, Konstantin held the župa (county) of Nevesinje from 1303 to 1306. As this area was part of Hum (or Zahumlje), he was also called the regent of Hum. As it was common in Serbia at the time for older son and presumable heir (\\"Young King\\") to be given the administration over Zeta (modern Montenegro), with the accompanying style of the King of Zeta, Milutin gave the position to Stefan Dečanski. However, Stefan was unsatisfied with his prospects of inheriting the crown since the marriage with his mother was annulled, making him an illegitimate child. Also pushed by the local nobility, Stefan started the rebellion against his father in 1314 which was quickly quashed with Milutin personally heading the army. Stefan fled across the Bojana river but Milutin offered negotiations. Stefan accepted, but Milutin shackled him instead and ordered for Stefan to be blinded (which wasn't conducted properly due to the bribery) and expelled to Constantinople. Milutin then appointed Konstantin to administer Zeta. Konstantin was declared King of Zeta and minted his own money in Shkodër. Silver coins represented Konstantin sitting on the throne had inscriptions \\"Dominus rex Constantinus\\" and \\"Sanctus Stefanus Scutari\\" on the obverse and reverse, respectively. He was also sent by his father in diplomatic missions. In October 1321, when Milutin died, Konstantin was in Constantinople, hiring additional military forces for the warfare with the Hungarians. However, neither the historians, nor Milutin himself, apparently held no high regard for Konstantin. Though his father gave him Zeta to rule, he didn't declare him heir apparent right away. He seemingly had no better opinion on his other son, Stefan, as even during the time when both of his sons were in Serbia, Milutin was prospecting to appoint one of the Byzantine princes as his heir. His last mother-in-law, Byzantine empress consort Irene, mother of Milutin's another child bride Simonis, sent in time two of her sons to Milutin. Younger prince Demetrios refused the post as he disliked Serbia, and the attempt with the older prince, Theodore, also failed. On 12 March 1316, Milutin's older brother, king Stefan Dragutin, died. As per the power- sharing 1282 Deževa Agreement between the brothers, Dragutin's heir, Vladislav II, was to become the paramount king of Serbia and not only of the northern Realm of Stefan Dragutin, while Milutin will accept the vassal position to his nephew. Milutin had no intention of following the agreement. Not only that he didn't accept the kingship of Vladislav, he attacked new king's domain in the north and captured him. Only after all this, when he was left without other possibilities (blind and expelled Stefan, failed attempts with brothers-in- law, possible pretenders from Dragutin's line), Milutin named Konstantin as his heir, and began to prepare him for succession. Naming happened sometime in 1317 or after, as Milutin mentions Konstantin as his heir in his endowment to the Bari Cathedral which included a silver altar with Konstantin's inscribed name. In his father's major endowment, the Gračanica Monastery, which was built in this period, Konstantin was portrayed twice. On the fresco which represents family tree of the dynasty, he was placed on his father's right side. He is also present on the fresco with his father and grandparents, Stefan Uroš I and Helen of Anjou. His brother Stefan is absent from the paintings. After 7 years, under the influence of clergy and especially of Serbian archbishop Nikodim I, Milutin allowed Stefan Dečanski to return to Serbia from Constantinople in 1321. He gave him to administer the župa of Budimlja, but kept Stefan's oldest son, future emperor Stefan Dušan at his court. Stefan Dečanski's return didn't change anything in Konstantin's designation as the heir. Milutin was already old and ill and certain groups again influenced Stefan to rebel and overthrow his father, but this time Stefan refused. However, he used his father's illness to prepare for the time after Milutin's death, organizing a strong party of followers.  Kingship  King Milutin died on 29 October 1321. Untrustworthy towards anyone, he didn't arrange the proper transition. Though naming Konstantin as his heir in public at least since 1319, he never actually issued any official decree confirming that or declared him as such in the state assembly, which prompted some historians to refer to Konstantin as the alleged heir. Danilo II, Serbian archbishop and one of the main medieval chroniclers, was the staunch supporter of Stefan Dečanski and wrote that Milutin left no official successor as he lost ability to speak due to his illness. At the time of Milutin's death, Konstantin was in Constantinople, drafting the army of mercenaries. Stefan Dečanski, who was in Serbia, upon hearing the news of his father's death, took down the bandages from his eyes (which he kept for years, pretending to be blind) and declared that Saint Nicholas miraculously restored his sight. As blindness was one of the reasons he was excluded from the succession, Stefan now reclaimed his right to the throne. Using commotion which followed after the death of Milutin, his imprisoned nephew Vladislav fled and also restored his claim to the throne. Konstantin returned from Constantinople and continued to mint coins, use the title of king and oppose other two claimants. Venetian chronicles from this period refer to him as \\"king\\" (rex). Stefan was more popular. He prepared himself well, he was a favorite of the church, his life was seen as an ordeal and martyrdom by the population who believed his miraculous healing, and he was of fully Slavic origin. Konstantin apparently failed to grasp and prevent both the Stefan's popularity and high regard he had in Serbian society. By the next year, the highest ranked members of the clergy officially turned back on Konstantin and archbishop Nikodim II crowned Stefan Dečanski on the Epiphany, 6 January 1322, in the Žiča monastery. = Civil war = Coronation of Stefan Dečanski on 6 January 1322 triggered the civil war in which Konstantin ultimately lost his life With Vladislav II, claiming the title since 12 March 1316, and Konstantin, succeeding to Milutin on 29 October 1321, Serbia now had three proclaimed kings, which was a situation that couldn't last for long. The first skirmishes began after Stefan's coronation. Stefan offered Konstantin the power-sharing agreement where Konstantin would \\"accept another dignified realm, as the second son\\". Though some historians use just the term \\"power share\\", it was obvious that what Stefan offered was not an equal, co-ruling status for Konstantin. Konstantin declined Stefan's offer. He considered himself a rightful heir and seems that he didn't believe Stefan regained his vision, as he stated that \\"it doesn't suite for blind man to rule\\". Also, Konstantin thought he will prevail due to the army of foreign mercenaries he organized on his father's orders, starting with his visit to Constantinople in 1321. Some sources point to the possibility that Stefan offered to share the power cause he may be initially reluctant to use force, as they report that Konstantin actually \\"forced out\\" the warfare. The war was described as \\"lasting long and fought severely\\". From the outside, Stefan was supported by the Byzantines, as during his exile in Constantinople he was sheltered by the emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos and later, after he secured Serbian throne, he married Andronik's great-niece Maria. Vladislav was supported by the gentry in northern Serbia and by the king Charles I of Hungary. According to Serbian epic poetry, in simplified form, Konstantin was supported by the Bulgarians, Vladislav was a Hungarian candidate while Stefan Dečanski was supported by the Byzantines, but there is no evidence that Bulgarians held Konstantin's side. Actually, they indirectly helped Vladislav, which is why bishop Danilo (II), was sent to Veliko Tarnovo in Bulgaria to negotiate peace. The final battle between the armies of Konstantin and Stefan occurred below the Zvečan fortress, in the Mitrovica field (Dmitrovačko Polje or Mitrovičko Polje), sometime in the spring of 1322. Stefan Dečanski bribed part of Konstantin's army, so some troops switched sides during the battle, abandoning Konstantin. All available sources agree that Konstantin was heavily defeated in the battle, not surviving it. After defeating Konstantine, Stefan Dečanski was now able to focus on the northern throne contender, Vladislav II. Having much larger support than Konstantin (rulers of Hungary and Bosnia, local nobility), Vladislav proved out to be also a tougher opponent. The war continued for two more years, until the spring of 1324, when Vladislav was finally defeated. He fled to Hungary, while Stefan Dečanski became the sole ruler Serbia. = Death = Exact date and circumstances of Konstantin's death are not known, just as those of his birth. Gregory Tsamblak and Serbian 17th-century Pejatović Chronicle claim he was killed in the battlefield. Other sources claim he was either captured or killed during the retreat of the remains of his army. That way, Konstantin was the first Nemanjić killed in the battle since the Battle of Pantina, dated sometime in 1166-1168, when Tihomir Zavidović perished in fighting. Coincidentally, both battles were fought between two Nemanjić brothers and both took place at Zvečan. A 1332 work, variously attributed to the Dominican Pseudo-Brocard, or to the Roman Catholic cleric Guillaume Adam, depicts Konstantin's more gruesome ending. Allegedly, Stefan ordered for captured Konstantin to be laid on the plank of wood, with his arms and thighs nailed to the wood. He was then sawed in half. Modern historians disregard such account of events, preferring the Camblak's account as more believable. Also, the entire chronicle has strong anti-Stefan sentiment while Adam was notorious for his negative attitude towards Serbs, calling them the \\"snake batch\\". This manner of death resembles the Biblical tale of the Crucifixion of Jesus, and as Stefan had no reason to make a martyr out of Konstantin, it is believed that Adam fabricated the story altogether. However, several other variants of Konstantin's grisly death survived. Ragusan chronicler Mavro Orbini adopted Adam's account in his 1601 Kingdom of the Slavs, but makes a point that it was actually Vladislav who captured and tortured Konstantin. According to the folk poetry, recorded by Vuk Karadžić, the mercenaries bribed by Stefan Dečanski were those who nailed him to the plank and sawed him in half, throwing the remains into the river (Ibar ?). Folk myths tell stories of Stefan beheading Konstantin, silver plating his skull into the cup and drinking wine from it. Resting place of Konstantin is also unknown for sure. Old Serbian chronicles claim he was buried in Zvečan. There were two churches, dedicated to Saint Nicholas and Saint George. Archaeological surveys in the Church of Saint George showed that not only Konstantin, but no one was buried there. Close to Zvečan is the Banjska Monastery, the endowment and planned burial church of his father, king Milutin, so it is believed that Konstantin was buried there. In four of the chronicles, \\"holy relics\\" of Konstantin were mentioned, which indicated that, at some point, he was canonized and declared a saint.  Assessment and legacy  Stefan Konstantin's ring, exhibited in the National Museum of Serbia Despite Milutin's final intention to groom Konstantin as his heir, and his willingness for military confrontation against Stefan Dečanski to keep the throne, historians described him as a \\"little known\\", \\"apparently a heir\\" and an anti-king even though he was a designated successor. He has also been labeled as not having any special treats and values, being a weak man and a person who didn't excel in anything. Danilo's Disciple and Continuators, scholars who continued chronological work of Danilo II, completely ignored the civil war and turmoil after Milutin's death. Konstantin was mentioned in several Serbian medieval chronologies and genealogies (rodoslov): Koporinjski, Studenički, Cetinjski, Vrhobreznički, Senički. His name remains preserved at the altar in Bari, Italy, and his image remained on the frescoes in the Gračanica Monastery. However, in the large Nemanjić family tree fresco in the monastery of Visoki Dečani, built by his brother Stefan who defeated him, Konstantin is not present. Modern writings dealing with Konstantin include works Comes Constantinus [\\"Count Konstantin\\"] by Mihailo Dinić (1961), Konstantin, sin kralja Milutina [\\"Konstantin, son of king Milutin\\"] by Marica Malović Đukić (1985), and Nemanjići drugog reda [\\"Members of the Nemanjić dynasty of the second order\\"] by Dejan Ječmenica (2018). A ring from the Banjska Monastery, originating from the early 14th century, is kept in the National Museum in Belgrade. Until recently, it was thought the ring belonged to Stefan Dečanski's first wife, Teodora. Modern historians assigned the ring to Konstantin. Konstantin provided long lists of Byzantine, Bulgarian and Serbian monarchs from the 11th century onward, as his father had done before him. The Vasojevići, one of the Serbian Highland tribes of Montenegro, and their progenitor Vaso, were mentioned for the first time in a document found in an Ragusan archive, dated to 1444. According to the Vasojevići folklore, Vaso was a great-grandson of Stefan Konstantin. The family myth claims that Konstantin had a son, Stefan Vasoje, who in turn, had a son Stefan Konstantin I, also called Stevo Vasojević in folk epic poetry, who was killed on 15 June 1389 in the Battle of Kosovo. Stefan Konstantin I had five sons - Oto, Kraso, Ozro, Pipo and Vaso, founder of the clan. Given the importance of the Vasojevići, especially of their diaspora, and following the myth of their origin which exists only in oral tradition though, the historic and modern descendants of Stefan Konstantin would be rebellion leader Karađorđe, brothers footballers and co-founders of Galatasaray Milija and Pavle Bakić, politician Slobodan Milošević, model and actress Milla Jovovich or tennis player Jelena Janković.

The Venetian Scuole were confraternities formed by ethnic or religious groups that lived in the city during the Renaissance. They provided an environment for the social, cultural and religious activities of their members. The Greek minority was present in Venice as early as the 13th century, but increased greatly in the 15th and 16th centuries after the Fall of Constantinople and the Ottoman expansion into the former Byzantine lands. On November 28, 1494, the Greeks received permission to establish a \\"Scuola e Nazione greca,\\" one of the \\"Scuole Piccole\\" and \\"Scuole Nazionali\\" of Venice.\\"Scuole Grandi\\" and \\"Piccole\\" of Venice, in \\"Scuola Grande San Giovanni Evangelista\\", 2007 Initially there was a stipulation that membership should not exceed 250 persons (despite there being a Greek quarter in the city with a population of over 4000), apart from women and children. The Scuola had a constitution with provisions for voting procedures, representation, and the formation of a council. In 1563 the number of the councillors, the governing body of the colony, was set at forty and was later increased. The officials, headed by a president Gastaldo, were salaried by the community but were under the supervision of the Venetian government. The success of the Greek community in securing formal recognition from the Venetian government was probably due in large part to the increasing dependence of the Venetian state on the military services of the Stratioti.Geanakoplos D. (1966) Two Worlds of Christendom in Middle Ages and Renaissance, in Byzantine East & West. The Academy LiLibrary Harper & Row Publishers, New York. The Greeks initially used Catholic churches for their gatherings until Venice granted them permission to settle permanently and build in the Castello area in 1456. The Greek community was well accepted by the city largely because of the education and the ideas they brought. in 1539 they were allowed by the Venetian government to build a Greek Orthodox church, the church of San Giorgio dei Greci and formed the Scuola di San Nicolo dei Greci (or Scuola dei Greci), as well as the Flanginian School. This Scuola was one of the few Venetian Scuole around which an entire community developed. Around the Church of San Giorgio other buildings and rooms were built for the meetings of the Confraternity.Stops A.

He was signed to play for the reserve team and occasionally served as understudy to first-choice 'keeper Bernd Jakubowski.

Ramme was brought on, and proceeded to let in six goals in the half, as Dynamo lost 7–3, 7–5 on aggregate. The six goals came in the space of 29 minutes: Wolfgang Funkel (who had been involved in the challenge that injured Jakubowski) scored a penalty in the 58th minute, which was followed by an own goal by Ralf Minge five minutes later.

The continuous rainfalls in combination with unstable grounds and dwellings located in high risk zones contributed to the widespread damages. The flooding and associated landslides killed 174 persons, left 225 wounded and 19 others missing. 1.5 million were left homeless. Meteorology Colombia is a country located in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and as an effect to this, the country is vulnerable to the meteorological patterns that affect the Caribbean region such as hurricanes and tropical storms. Remnants of Hurricane Tomas in combination with La Niña made the 2010 wet season of Colombia one of the deadliest and heaviest in rainfalls in the last 40 years. The torrential rainfall, wind gusts, electric storms and a constant light rain in some places started in June 2010 and became stronger and more frequent in August and September. Impact The floods and landslides affected 70% of the country and left homeless more than 2,2 million people.Santos to appoint reconstruction coordinator for flood-hit north - Colombia news  Colombia Reports 301 people have been killedColombia to hike taxes $1.6B to finance flood recovery - Colombia news  Colombia Reports =Guajira Department= The Colombian System of Information for the Prevention and Attention to Disaster CREPAD (Sistema de informacion para la Prevencion y Atencion de Desatres) established that throughout 2010 there were 10.303 people affected by the rains with a total of 1.819 families and 9 homes completely destroyed and 334 in very bad conditions. The department of Guajira being located in the northern tip of Colombia was seriously affected by the 2010 hurricane season. Remnants of the tropical storm Matthew hit Guajira and the Atlantic coast of Colombia with heavy rains. Among the most affected municipalities are Maicao, Riohacha and Manaure. Maicao and Riohacha have been the most affected ones since a number of families live in homes usually located in lower grounds. This communities are usually the most vulnerable because many of them are organized without the control of the Office for the distribution of land that regulates the housing building in Colombia. =Atlántico Department= The department of Atlántico has been particularly affected by the rupture of the levees of the Dique Channel (Canal del Dique). To the south of the Department of Atlántico some tributaries of the Magdalena river crested and flooded entire towns. This flood was able to raise the levels of the El Guajaro dam to a flow of 1400 cubic meters per second. According to Semana magazine the emergency has been compared to the floods caused by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, United States. The magazine also predicted that is possible that many of the inhabitants of southern Atlántico might never be able to come back to their lands and will have to change their way of life due to the impact of the floods. =Bolívar Department= Bolívar Department is also one of the most affected areas of the Colombia rainy season of 2010. On December 2010 the Minister of Defense Rodrigo Rivera Salazar traveled to the city of Cartagena (capital of Bolivar) in order to evaluate and coordinate the steps to take to diminish the emergency faced by the department. The minister informed that Bolivar had 60 thousand affected households and called it \\"the department most seriously hit\\" by the rainy season and its floods. =Cundinamarca Department and Bogotá= On November 2010 the governor of the Cundinamarca Department, Andres Gonzalez alerted the municipalities of Tabio, Chia and Cajica since they were under threat by a possible cresting of the Frio river. He also advised the population about the possibility of including the municipality of Soacha because of the cresting of the Bogotá River. After the onset of heavy rains on the paramus of Guerrero the Bogotá river finally flooded some areas affecting different municipalities. =Córdoba Department= On December 15, 2010 the Sinú River started to flood affecting a number of municipalities in the department of Córdoba. On December 16 the city of Montería had 8 neighborhoods under water. The government issued an alert and mandated the evacuation of the city. =Norte de Santander Department= 32 out of 40 municipalities of Norte de Santander Department had been unreachable by the debri and floods in its roads. The most serious blocking occurred on the Ocana - Cúcuta road. The landslides and avalanches in some parts affected over 60 thousand people. On November 8 a landslide occurred in the municipality of El Carmen . The most affected zones were the neighborhood of El Libano where 19 houses were destroyed and 5 more were rendered unusable. The Colombian Air Force had to move food and medical supplies on helicopters since the road access was blocked The town of Guamalito was completely affected with its inhabitants without potable water, electric power nor access to the cellphone networks. On December 17 the municipality of Gramalote suffered a landslide that affected 400 homes at the periphery of the town. The entire population was evacuated. In addition to the rain, a geological fault made the houses in this town to crumble like poker cards. 100 houses collapsed and some streets and pedestrian walkways broke open as if an earthquake had taken place.

The assigned budget for the repairing of damaged houses is 1.76 billion Colombian pesos (approx. US$880 million). =Request for help to the international community= On December 7, Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos announced that Colombia would make a petition for a credit to the World Bank of 150 million dollars. Additionally he would make use of 25 million dollars seized to drug traffickers in order to help 1.3 million people affected by the floods and rains and the families of 154 people killed by the floods and landslides. On November 25, 2010, president Santos ordered chancellor of Colombia (equivalent to Secretary of State in the United States) Maria Angela Holguín to send a formal request of help to all the international representatives and accredited multilateral organizations located in Bogotá. Minister of the Interior and justice German Vargas Lleras announced that by decree the government declares a \\"national catastrophe\\" in order to make use of credits to alleviate the needs of the victims. Such decree was sent to the council of ministers, who approved it and provided access to 150 million dollars in credit from the World Bank. Vargas Lleras said that the priority was to alleviate the humanitarian emergency and then to begin with the reconstruction of houses and the prevention of new tragedies. =United States= The government of President Barack Obama through its ambassador Michael McKinley expressed commitment to the Colombian people affected by the rainy season. On December 15, 2010, McKinley announced that the American government had donated 1.3 million dollars as initial help and within the following weeks a team of American engineers of the American Army would arrive in order to help in the reparation of the Dique Channel. =Israel= On December 12, 2010, following a decision of the IDF and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, a delegation from the Home Front Command was sent, carrying approximately 50 tons of equipment including 20 tons of dry food, five thousand medical kits, two thousand blankets, one thousand ponchos, one thousand mattresses and one hundred tents. =Ecuador= The government of Ecuador donated 32 tons of food and supplies for the victims.

Johan Lennarts was born on 18 December 1932 in Strijp, Eindhoven, the youngest one of a family with five children. He used to paint as a child and even won the consolation prize in a contest for the school, but later on he gave up the art creation. Lennarts survived the Second World War and in 1945 he attended the Beekvliet seminary in Sint Michielsgestel to become a monk. In 1948 he attended the Joris College in Eindhoven and four years later he started to draw again during his final year at the HBS (Former Dutch High School), receiving already in 1959 a grant from the French government.Jacobs, P.M.J.

Unlike his subjects, the styles and the painting techniques have changed along the years. Lennarts started working under the influence of CoBrA, joining efforts with the artist association and later art centre Vrije Expressieven (Free Expressive) in the 1956. In a decade later he constituted the anarchical collective Schijt aan Schilderkunst (Bollocks to Painting, SAS). It was by the exhibition titled after the SAS that Lennarts led the world see his fascination for the green colour, even producing his own “lennartsgreen”. After the American Pop Art he created collages, panels and polyptichs while he was also engaged with social projects. In 1970 another exhibition took place: Tot lering en vermaak (To education and enjoyment, Van Abbemuseum) in order to bring art closer to people and make it more understandable. Johan Lennarts, Ad Snijders and Lukas Smits organized the show and according to their conclusion that artists should be involved in planning the living environment, they decorated the exhibiting space as a private house.Tjeu Teeuwen and Francis Bach Kolling, Ad Snijders, Eindhoven: Galerie Willy Schoots, 1990, p. 69 The “second Lennarts” was born in the 1970s, when the artist presented cheerful landscapes executed in a calligraphic manner to the public. This period was marked by the artist’s philosophic readings of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Martin Heidegger and the questions that he posed to himself. Empty places populate the paintings of this second phase: polder landscapes, empty park stations, empty trains, parks and house interiors. His intellectual interests were also put down into words in a vast written corpus. Lennarts wrote poems, theatre plays and novels being prized by the city of Eindhoven incentive contest for his texts in Raam (1967) and by the same city for his novel Koekoeksklok in Utopia (A Cuckoo Clock in Utopia, 1985). His work has been on display in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Surinam and several art works belong to the contemporary art collections of both the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven. The artist belonged to the association BBK Amsterdam (1969–1981) and Arti et Amicitiae (1981–1991). Lennarts lived in Eindhoven until 1969, then in Griendtsveen (1976–1983), Amsterdam (1983–1987), and finally in France where he died in 1991. “I believe that Lennarts depicted the human condition in the form of ‘fleeting moments’ (…) Lennart’s ‘snapshots’ of the human condition constitute a special representation of one of the great themes of mankind.”Philip Peters, \\"An Impressionist of the Human Condition\\", in Johan Lennarts 1932-1999: een impressionist van het menselĳk tekort, De Beyerd: Peninsula, 1999, p. 146 See also *History of painting *Western painting References External links * Johan Lennarts at Play BKR Eindhoven * Lennarts Stichting Category:1932 births Category:1991 deaths Category:20th-century Dutch painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:Dutch sculptors Category:Dutch male sculptors Category:Scenic designers Category:People from Eindhoven ","title":"Johan Lennarts"},{"id":"29560406","text":"The Bud Light Daredevils were an American acrobatic basketball show that performed during the halftime of college and NBA basketball games from 1983 to 1998.

Ole Miss and the Inception of Acrobatic Basketball (1979–83) Ole Miss cheerleaders (including Colonel Reb) performing as the halftime entertainment during a Houston Rockets game In 1980, Ty Cobb, along with fellow cheerleaders Sam Martin, John White, and Jeff Hubbard (as Ole Miss Rebels mascot Colonel Reb) began performing ball handling skits and acrobatics which incorporated a mini-trampoline during the time-outs and half-time of Ole Miss basketball games. Using his previous trampoline and diving skills and the cheerleader's mini-trampoline, Ty Cobb, on a dare performed the first successful acrobatic \\"flip dunk\\" at the Ole Miss vs. Alabama basketball game in 1980 and received a standing ovation by Alabama fans. Ole Miss Head Basketball Coach Bob Weltlich, recognizing the group's potential to soften up an opposing team's crowd, began flying the foursome with the Ole Miss Basketball team to away games. In 1980, Ty Cobb's fraternity brother and fellow Ole Miss cheerleader Walt Shinault was practicing stunts using a mini- trampoline in the yard of his apartment complex in Oxford when he fell and broke his neck. The fall left him a quadriplegic. After the accident the Southeastern Conference (SEC) banned the use of mini-trampolines by all cheerleaders at SEC games. With the banning of the use of mini-trampolines by cheerleaders throughout the SEC, Ty Cobb began looking for other ways for the group to continue performing their developing halftime show. Working on a marketing class project which had asked that students create their own company, Ty Cobb created a company called \\"The Ole Miss Cheerleaders Half Time Show\\". He designed marketing brochures and advertising materials that he then sent to National Basketball Association (NBA) promotional directors as part of a direct marketing campaign. The concept worked as the promotional directors at many of the NBA teams were looking for new ways to increase attendance and contacted Ty to schedule the \\"Ole Miss Cheerleaders\\" to perform during the time outs and halftime of their home games. The first professional NBA performance by The Ole Miss Cheerleaders was for the San Antonio Spurs in 1980, followed by shows for the Houston Rockets and Dallas Mavericks. Still in high school in 1981, Ty Cobb's younger brother Guy Cobb joined the show for performances at NBA games. With the addition of Guy, the team began experimenting with different ways to acrobatically pass the basketball. These passes were mixed and matched with each other to not only allow for more complex acrobatic dunks to be performed but also to provide a way for the team to incorporate more passes into the dunk sequences without having to stop the show. One example was the \\"flip-pass\\" off the basketball backboard. This pass could be followed by another flip-pass and another and then a dunk (\\"Congo Dunk\\" 1987). The Dixie Daredevils (1983–84) Brothers Ty and Guy Cobb performing with Steve Cliffe as \\"The Dixie Daredevils\\" in a grocery store parking lot (Summer 1983). Following his graduation from Ole Miss in the Fall of 1983, Ty Cobb began planning to create a professional half-time show that would travel and perform during the college and NBA basketball season.[10] Guy Cobb, having just completed his freshman year at Ole Miss, dropped out of school to join his brother.[13] In 1983 Cobb's father became President of Colonial Baking Company in St. Louis.[2] The two Cobb brothers relocated with their parents to the small community of Columbia, Illinois located southeast of St. Louis. They set up an office in their parent's basement and began organizing a performance schedule for the 1983-84 basketball season. Charles Cobb came up with the team's new professional name of \\"Dixie Daredevils\\". Steve Cliffe, a former Mehlville High School school mate of Ty Cobb's also joined the Dixie Daredevils at this time.[2] [14] In the Summer of 1983, Cobb's father scheduled the Dixie Daredevils as a Colonial Bread promotion. He sponsored the Dixie Daredevils for performances in grocery store parking lots and at high school assemblies throughout the metro St. Louis and central Illinois areas.[2] [14] During the 1983-84 basketball season, Ty and Guy Cobb performed 45 shows throughout the United States. At the end of the season they received a call from Anheuser-Busch to discuss a sponsorship of the Dixie Daredevils to be associated with a new beer called \\"Budweiser Light\\".[2] The Bud Light Daredevils (1984–1998) Guy Cobb performing with the Bud Light Daredevils in 1987. Both Cobb brothers worked for Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA) during the Summer of 1982 as cheerleading instructors. Ty Cobb had met Mack Hirshberg at UCA's college cheerleading camp the previous Summer. Hirshberg was a cheerleader at the University of South Carolina and had just graduated. In the Summer of 1983 Anheuser-Busch changed the name of their new beer \\"Budweiser Light\\" to \\"Bud Light\\". Mack Hirshberg joined the group for the 1984-85 premiere season and the team's name was changed from The Dixie Daredevils to The Bud Light Daredevils.[10] [15] From 1984 to 1998 the Bud Light Daredevils performed at universities and NBA games throughout all 50 United States.[16] When they were not performing during the American basketball season, they found sponsors for tours of the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Spain, Japan, China, Norway, South America, Australia, Israel, and Puerto Rico. Corporate sponsors included Boeing, Converse, Wang Laboratories, SportLife Chewing Gum, and Gordon's Gin. The group was also featured on national television shows such as ABC's That's Incredible!, Incredible Sunday, Showtime's Super Dave (TV series), Disney's The Mickey Mouse Club, and most recently, former Bud Light Daredevil Mark Odgers was featured performing a flip dunk over a New York City Cab live on Late Night with David Letterman.[10] Anheuser-Busch ended their fourteen-year sponsorship of the Bud Light Daredevils in 1998 in response to both governmental and social pressure to eliminate all alcohol marketing to college students.[17] [18] See also * Slamball * Ole Miss * University of Mississippi * Guy Cobb Category:Ball games Category:Sports entertainment Category:Slamball Category:Performing groups established in 1983 Category:Anheuser-Busch advertising ","title":"Bud Light Daredevils"},{"id":"29560413","text":"Boyd and Wain is an acoustic duo composed of American singer songwriter Katy Boyd and English violinist Benny Wain.

He later served as the commanding officer of 40 Commando, and was a recipient of the Military Cross. Early life David Peter Lafayette Hunter was born at Minnis Hall, Stelling Minnis, Kent on 24 November 1919.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1339726/Lt-Col- David-Hunter.html Obituary of Lt-Col David Hunter, The Daily Telegraph, 7 September 2001 He was the third son of Major Edgar Lafayette Hunter MC and Dorothy Thompson. He was educated at Shrewsbury. Military career Hunter joined the Royal Marines in 1937 and passed out at Deal, Kent, just before the outbreak of World War II. On 2 Feb 1940 he was made probationary Lieutenant. He was posted to the heavy cruiser patrolling waters around Iceland. The Norfolk was bombed whilst at Scapa Flow on 16 March 1940 and sent to the Clyde for repair.http://www.world-war.co.uk/Dorset/norfolk.php3 Search for HMS Norfolk at WW2 Cruisers. Retrieved 8 November 2010 Hunter was redeployed to Chatham, where he was selected for the Calais force as part of the BEF. =Calais= Hunter was part of Captain Darby Courtice's company of 85 Royal Marines which landed at Calais shortly after midnight on 25 May 1940. With one other officer, Lt Hugh Bruce, they were charged with helping French marines to defend the ancient citadel at the centre of the town. There they were attacked by the full might of XIX Panzer Corps and, by early evening, were surrounded and out of ammunition.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1419707/Major-Hugh- Bruce.html Obituary of Major Hugh Bruce, The Daily Telegraph, 23 January 2003 Hunter was later mentioned in dispatches for his \\"courage and devotion to duty\\" in racing up and down the beach to keep his unit's machine gun supplied with ammunition. They had fought with such vigor that the official German record read, \\"The enemy gives the impression of being fresh, and seems to have received reinforcements after two days of heavy fighting.\\" Despite their efforts, within two days Calais had been surrendered to the Germans, and the British troops, including Hunter, taken prisoner. =Prisoner of war= The captured troops were marched through northern France, the Ardennes and Trier to Mainz. From there, they were moved on to Laufen camp in Bavaria, then transferred to Tittmoning. The Royal Marines officers were moved to Marlag und Milag Nord part of Stalag X-B at Sandbostel, where they soon started planning their escape. Bruce, Hunter's fellow Marine officer, was imprisoned with him and, over the winter of 1941–42, the two men became firm friends. With a number of colleagues they conceived, designed and built by hand a masterpiece of British engineering – a 251-yard-long tunnel, complete with rest bay, electric lighting and air flow system, as well as a signalling device to warn of the approach of sentries. Over 100 tons of soil was excavated and concealed under a hut.http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article856026.ece Obituary of Major Hugh Bruce, The Times, 27 January 2003 On 7 April 1942 Hunter, Bruce and 10 other officers made their escape. After 12 days on the run, Bruce and Hunter were captured near Flensburg, within a few hundred yards of the Danish border. After a brief spell back at Sandbostel, the pair escaped, this time by jumping aboard a prison lorry, but were recaptured at Hamburg railway station by the German police. They were transferred to Stalag VIII-B in Lamsdorf, Silesia, a prison camp for \\"other ranks\\". Their stay lasted only a few months. Hunter was found dangling from a window within inches of a snarling guard dog, and two of Hunter's colleagues were also caught escaping. The miscreants were summarily banished to Colditz Castle. =Colditz= In early August 1942 Bruce and Hunter arrived at Colditz Castle (then prisoner of war camp Oflag IV-C), where fellow persistent escapees were highly engaged in planning more escapes, and Hunter was soon involved in the various projects. The three Royal Marine officers (Capt Courtice, their company commander at Calais, was also at Colditz) had a reputation for bravery and good humour, and Hunter was noted as being particularly outspoken, a persistent nuisance to his captors and equally amusing to his colleagues. He once stole the cap of the German officer who was expounding on the merits of Wagner during a musical evening. Another incident even made the Germans laugh when, late for a roll-call, he called languidly from a castle window to the parade below \\"I'll come down and join you all in a minute\\". In October 1943 Mike Sinclair was caught during the daring Franz Josef escape. Although Sinclair had surrendered, he was shot at close range by a German officer. Hunter, along with many other witnesses, believed his friend to be dead and shouted \\"German murderers!\\". He was subsequently sentenced at a court martial to two months in Graudenz military prison. Forty years later, some 30 officers and their wives made a return visit to Colditz, and Hunter was seen by millions of television viewers standing in the courtyard and taking off the Commandant's \\"Call to Appell\\" at the top of his voice. Despite the many notable escape attempts from Colditz, Hunter remained in Colditz until release on 16 April 1945. =Post war= Following release he underwent a brief re- training period. He was appointed temporary captain 25 February 1946. Hunter was appointed officer commanding Royal Marines in Berlin. This was not a sensitive posting, and Hunter was soon returned to Britain. He was next posted to the aircraft carrier, . Detecting a poor level of morale aboard, he and Donald Douglas, a former prisoner of the Japanese, determined to confront the ship's captain and insist on reasonable treatment. On entering the captain's cabin, Hunter declared \\"Look, Sir, we're here to tell you that we've both been bd about as PoWs and we're not having any of it in peacetime!\\". Douglas was aghast, but to his surprise the captain replied, \\"All right, I hear you. Dismiss!\\". The ship's captain later confided to them \\"Lucky for you on the first day we met that I was reading a book on how to deal with ex-PoWs, or your fate might have been different.\\" Subsequent postings took him to Egypt, Aqaba, Hong Kong and, in 1950, Malaya. He was made Officer in Charge Cameron Highlands Jungle Operation, protecting planters from Communist guerillas during the Malayan Emergency. Not long after arriving, he was asked to take a Mr Justice Brown on a jungle patrol with 45 Commando. Whilst advancing up a hill at Ringlet they encountered six bandits, one of whom threw a grenade at the soldiers whilst they made their escape. In an act he later described as a \\"mental aberration\\", Hunter calmly covered the grenade with his hat and held it while his comrades ran to safety. Fortunately the grenade failed to detonate. Later, to Hunter's astonishment, he was awarded the Military Cross for his \\"vigor, determination and outstanding skill\\" in conducting operations against the bandits. He was promoted to major on 14 January 1955. In 1956 he became Amphibious Staff officer, 3 Commando Brigade at Suez. There followed postings to the RN Staff College, Greenwich, and at Amphibious Warfare HQ, London, followed by a six-month Joint Training Course with the US Marines in San Diego. In 1961 his promotion to lieutenant colonel was confirmed. and he took command of 40 Commando until 1963. Based in Singapore, he was frequently employed in Borneo during the confrontation with the Indonesians following the Brunei Revolt of 1962. After a series of staff appointments, Hunter retired from the Royal Marines 3 March 1967. Civilian Life Hunter married WAAF officer, Barbara Lewis, in Brentford late in 1945. They had two sons. Following his retirement from the Marines, Hunter and his family emigrated to Freeport, Bahamas. In 1967 Hunter joined the real estate company of McPherson & Brown.Churchill & Jones Real Estate Ltd. Retrieved 11 November 2010 Barbara died in 1971 and, in 1974 Hunter subsequently remarried to Suzanne Twiston- Davies, a journalist with the BBC. In 1981, he and colleague, Hilary Jones, bought McPherson & Brown, changing its name to Churchill & Jones. In 1997 Hunter led Churchill & Jones into obtaining the franchise for the Northern Bahamas of RE/MAX, the international real estate conglomerate.

Major constituents of the arts include visual arts (including architecture, ceramics, drawing, filmmaking, painting, photography, and sculpting), literary arts (including fiction, drama, poetry, and prose), performing arts (including dance, music, and theatre), and culinary arts (including cooking, chocolate making and winemaking). Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. cinematography), or artwork with the written word (e.g. comics). From prehistoric cave paintings to modern-day films, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying humankind's relationship with the environment. Definition There are several possible meanings for the definitions of the terms Art and Arts. The first meaning of the word art is « way of doing ». The most basic present meaning defines the arts as specific activities that produce sensitivity in humans. The arts are also referred to as bringing together all creative and imaginative activities, without including science. In its most basic abstract definition, art is a documented expression of a sentient being through or on an accessible medium so that anyone can view, hear or experience it. The act itself of producing an expression can also be referred to as a certain art, or as art in general. If this solidified expression, or the act of producing it, is \\"good\\" or has value depends on those who access and rate it and this public rating is dependent on various subjective factors. Merriam-Webster defines \\"the arts\\" as \\"painting, sculpture, music, theatre, literature, etc., considered as a group of activities done by people with skill and imagination.\\" Similarly, the United States Congress, in the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, defined \\"the arts\\" as follows: Art is a global activity in which a large number of disciplines are included, such as: fine arts, liberal arts, visual arts, decorative arts, applied arts, design, crafts, performing arts, ... We are talking about \\"the arts\\" when several of them are mentioned: \\"As in all arts the enjoyment increases with the knowledge of the art\\". The arts can be divided into several areas, the fine arts which bring together, in the broad sense, all the arts whose aim is to produce true aesthetic pleasure, decorative arts and applied arts which relate to an aesthetic side in everyday life. The earliest surviving form of any of the arts are cave paintings, possibly from 70,000 BCE, but definitely from at least 40,000 BCE. The oldest known musical instrument, the Divje Babe Flute, is also dated to at least 40,000 BCE, while the earliest surviving literature, the Instructions of Shuruppak and Kesh temple hymn among other Sumerian cuneiform tablets, are thought to only be from 2600 BCE. History The Venus of Brassempouy In Ancient Greece, all art and craft was referred to by the same word, techne. Thus, there was no distinction among the arts. Ancient Greek art brought the veneration of the animal form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. Ancient Roman art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g. Zeus' thunderbolt). In Byzantine and Gothic art of the Middle Ages, the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical truths. Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of India, Tibet and Japan. Religious Islamic art forbids iconography, and instead expresses religious ideas through geometry. = Classifications = Lawrence Alma-Tadema's Catullus-at-Lesbia's (1865) In the Middle Ages, the Artes Liberales (liberal arts) were taught in universities as part of the Trivium, an introductory curriculum involving grammar, rhetoric, and logic, and of the Quadrivium, a curriculum involving the \\"mathematical arts\\" of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. The Artes Mechanicae (consisting of vestiaria – tailoring and weaving; agricultura – agriculture; architectura – architecture and masonry; militia and venatoria – warfare, hunting, military education, and the martial arts; mercatura – trade; coquinaria – cooking; and metallaria – blacksmithing and metallurgy)In his commentary on Martianus Capella's early fifth century work, The Marriage of Philology and Mercury, one of the main sources for medieval reflection on the liberal arts were practised and developed in guild environments. The modern distinction between \\"artistic\\" and \\"non-artistic\\" skills did not develop until the Renaissance. In modern academia, the arts are usually grouped with or as a subset of the humanities. Some subjects in the humanities are history, linguistics, literature, theology, philosophy, and logic. The arts have also been classified as seven: painting, architecture, sculpture, literature, music, performing and cinema. Some view literature, painting, sculpture, and music as the main four arts, of which the others are derivative; drama is literature with acting, dance is music expressed through motion, and song is music with literature and voice. Visual arts =Architecture= The Parthenon on top of the Acropolis, Athens, Greece Architecture is the art and science of designing buildings and structures. The word architecture comes from the Greek arkhitekton, \\"master builder, director of works,\\" from αρχι- (arkhi) \\"chief\\" + τεκτων (tekton) \\"builder, carpenter\\". A wider definition would include the design of the built environment, from the macrolevel of town planning, urban design, and landscape architecture to the microlevel of creating furniture. Architectural design usually must address both feasibility and cost for the builder, as well as function and aesthetics for the user. Cyclopaedia, 1728 In modern usage, architecture is the art and discipline of creating, or inferring an implied or apparent plan of, a complex object or system. The term can be used to connote the implied architecture of abstract things such as music or mathematics, the apparent architecture of natural things, such as geological formations or the structure of biological cells, or explicitly planned architectures of human-made things such as software, computers, enterprises, and databases, in addition to buildings. In every usage, an architecture may be seen as a subjective mapping from a human perspective (that of the user in the case of abstract or physical artifacts) to the elements or components of some kind of structure or system, which preserves the relationships among the elements or components. Planned architecture manipulates space, volume, texture, light, shadow, or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing aesthetics. This distinguishes it from applied science or engineering, which usually concentrate more on the functional and feasibility aspects of the design of constructions or structures. In the field of building architecture, the skills demanded of an architect range from the more complex, such as for a hospital or a stadium, to the apparently simpler, such as planning residential houses. Many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political symbols, or works of art. The role of the architect, though changing, has been central to the successful (and sometimes less than successful) design and implementation of pleasingly built environments in which people live. = Ceramics = Ceramic art is art made from ceramic materials (including clay), which may take forms such as pottery, tile, figurines, sculpture, and tableware. While some ceramic products are considered fine art, some are considered to be decorative, industrial, or applied art objects. Ceramics may also be considered artefacts in archaeology. Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people. In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture, and decorate the pottery. Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as \\"art pottery.\\" In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce studio pottery. In modern ceramic engineering usage, \\"ceramics\\" is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat. It excludes glass and mosaic made from glass tesserae. =Conceptual art= Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work takes precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of idea-based art that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text. Through its association with the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize during the 1990s, its popular usage, particularly in the United Kingdom, developed as a synonym for all contemporary art that does not practise the traditional skills of painting and sculpture. =Drawing= Drawing is a means of making an image, using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax colour pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels, and markers. Digital tools which can simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are line drawing, hatching, crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, stippling, and blending. An artist who excels in drawing is referred to as a drafter, draftswoman, or draughtsman. Drawing can be used to create art used in cultural industries such as illustrations, comics and animation. =Painting= The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci Painting is a mode of creative expression, and can be done in numerous forms. Drawing, gesture (as in gestural painting), composition, narration (as in narrative art), or abstraction (as in abstract art), among other aesthetic modes, may serve to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a still life or landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism), or political in nature (as in Artivism). Modern painters have extended the practice considerably to include, for example, collage. Collage is not painting in the strict sense since it includes other materials. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as sand, cement, straw, wood or strands of hair for their artwork texture. Examples of this are the works of Elito Circa, Jean Dubuffet or Anselm Kiefer. =Photography= Photography as an art form refers to photographs that are created in accordance with the creative vision of the photographer. Art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism, which provides a visual account for news events, and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services. =Sculpture= Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials; but since modernism, shifts in sculptural process led to an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or moulded, or cast. Literary arts Literature is literally \\"acquaintance with letters\\" as in the first sense given in the Oxford English Dictionary. The noun \\"literature\\" comes from the Latin word littera meaning \\"an individual written character (letter).\\" The term has generally come to identify a collection of writings, which in Western culture are mainly prose (both fiction and non-fiction), drama and poetry. In much, if not all of the world, the artistic linguistic expression can be oral as well, and include such genres as epic, legend, myth, ballad, other forms of oral poetry, and as folktale. Comics, the combination of drawings or other visual arts with narrating literature, are often called the \\"ninth art\\" (le neuvième art) in Francophone scholarship. Performing arts Performing arts comprise dance, music, theatre, opera, mime, and other art forms in which a human performance is the principal product. Performing arts are distinguished by this performance element in contrast with disciplines such as visual and literary arts where the product is an object that does not require a performance to be observed and experienced. Each discipline in the performing arts is temporal in nature, meaning the product is performed over a period of time. Products are broadly categorized as being either repeatable (for example, by script or score) or improvised for each performance. Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called performers, including actors, magicians, comedians, dancers, musicians, and singers. Performing arts are also supported by the services of other artists or essential workers, such as songwriting and stagecraft. Performers often adapt their appearance with tools such as costume and stage makeup. =Dance= A ballroom dance exhibition Dance (from Old French dancier, of unknown origin) generally refers to human movement either used as a form of expression or presented in a social, spiritual or performance setting. Dance is also used to describe methods of non-verbal communication (see body language) between humans or animals (e.g. bee dance, mating dance), motion in inanimate objects (e.g. the leaves danced in the wind), and certain musical forms or genres. Choreography is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on social, cultural, aesthetic, artistic and moral constraints and range from functional movement (such as Folk dance) to codified, virtuoso techniques such as ballet. In sports, gymnastics, figure skating and synchronized swimming are dance disciplines while Martial arts \\"kata\\" are often compared to dances. =Music= A musical score by Mozart. Music is an art form whose medium is sound and silence, occurring in time. Common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, metre, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their reproduction in performance) through improvisational music to aleatoric pieces. Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within \\"the arts\\", music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art, and auditory art. =Theatre= Theatre or theater (from Greek theatron (θέατρον); from theasthai, \\"behold\\") is the branch of the performing arts concerned with acting out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle – indeed, any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as opera, ballet, mime, kabuki, classical Indian dance, Chinese opera and mummers' plays. Multidisciplinary artistic works Areas exist in which artistic works incorporate multiple artistic fields, such as film, opera and performance art. While opera is often categorized in the performing arts of music, the word itself is Italian for \\"works\\", because opera combines several artistic disciplines in a singular artistic experience. In a typical traditional opera, the entire work utilizes the following: the sets (visual arts), costumes (fashion), acting (dramatic performing arts), the libretto, or the words/story (literature), and singers and an orchestra (music). Ernestine Schumann-Heink as Waltraute The composer Richard Wagner recognized the fusion of so many disciplines into a single work of opera, exemplified by his cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (\\"The Ring of the Nibelung\\"). He did not use the term opera for his works, but instead Gesamtkunstwerk (\\"synthesis of the arts\\"), sometimes referred to as \\"Music Drama\\" in English, emphasizing the literary and theatrical components which were as important as the music. Classical ballet is another form which emerged in the 17th century in which orchestral music is combined with dance. Other works in the late 19th, 20th and 21st centuries have fused other disciplines in unique and creative ways, such as performance art. Performance art is a performance over time which combines any number of instruments, objects, and art within a predefined or less well- defined structure, some of which can be improvised. Performance art may be scripted, unscripted, random or carefully organized; even audience participation may occur. John Cage is regarded by many as a performance artist rather than a composer, although he preferred the latter term. He did not compose for traditional ensembles. Cage's composition Living Room Music composed in 1940 is a \\"quartet\\" for unspecified instruments, really non- melodic objects, which can be found in a living room of a typical house, hence the title. Other arts There is no clear line between art and culture. Cultural fields like gastronomy are sometimes considered as arts. =Applied arts= The applied arts are the application of design and decoration to everyday, functional, objects to make them aesthetically pleasing. The applied arts includes fields such as industrial design, illustration, and commercial art. The term \\"applied art\\" is used in distinction to the fine arts, where the latter is defined as arts that aims to produce objects which are beautiful or provide intellectual stimulation but have no primary everyday function. In practice, the two often overlap. =Video games= A debate exists in the fine arts and video game cultures over whether video games can be counted as an art form. Game designer Hideo Kojima professes that video games are a type of service, not an art form, because they are meant to entertain and attempt to entertain as many people as possible, rather than being a single artistic voice (despite Kojima himself being considered a gaming auteur, and the mixed opinions his games typically receive). However, he acknowledged that since video games are made up of artistic elements (for example, the visuals), game designers could be considered museum curators – not creating artistic pieces, but arranging them in a way that displays their artistry and sells tickets. Within social sciences, cultural economists show how video games playing is conducive to the involvement in more traditional art forms and cultural practices, which suggests the complementarity between video games and the arts. In May 2011, the National Endowment of the Arts included video games in its redefinition of what is considered a \\"work of art\\" when applying of a grant. In 2012, the Smithsonian American Art Museum presented an exhibit, The Art of the Video Game. Reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum.

Grosvenor Street runs in an east to west direction, with traffic flowing in both directions. The eastern terminus is at George Street and the western terminus is at the junction of York Street with the Bradfield Highway. There are no major cross streets. Originally named Charlotte Square by Governor Macquarie in 1810 in honour of Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the wife of King George III, Grosvenor Street was renamed in 1889 after the Grosvenor Hotel that was located at the intersection of Grosvenor and Cumberland Streets. Points of interest *Grosvenor Place This is a high-rise development designed by architect Harry Seidler and built in 1982-87. It occupies the block bounded by Grosvenor, George, Harrington and Essex Streets. The front foyer houses a number of paintings by the American artist Frank Stella. *Johnson's Building Constructed in 1912, the Johnson's Building is a six storey Edwardian brick-clad building in the Federation Free Classical architectural style, located at 233-235 George Street, The Rocks, on the corner of Gloucester Street. The building was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon, a former NSW Government architect. It is part of a group which has been listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. It was restored as part of the Grosvenor Place development and was adapted for use as a hotel. *Royal Naval House Also of the Federation Free Classical style, this building was designed by Varney Parkes and built between 1890 and 1907. Initially used by the Royal Australian Navy as accommodation and amenities for naval personnel, the building is currently used as part of the Sydney Futures Exchange. It is located next door to Federation Hall and courtyard and was restored along with that building. It is also listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. *Federation Hall and courtyard Constructed in the late Victorian style between 1889 and 1891, the Federation Hall and courtyard is located at 24-30 Grosvenor Street and is currently used as the Sydney Futures Exchange. The building was extended substantially from 1923–24 and was at one stage known as the Meat Board Building. It is located next door to Royal Naval House and was restored along with that building. It is also listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. *St Patrick's Catholic Church This church was designed by J. F. Hilly and built 1840-44. Founded by Father Therry, it was the first Catholic church in Sydney and became the central church for the Irish community. *Presbytery Situated next to St Patrick's, the presbytery was designed by Hennessy and Hennessy and built in 1914. It features the \\"blood and bandages\\" style composed of red bricks with contrasting white areas, and was influenced by British architects Mackintosh and Voysey. *Lang Park This park is a roughly triangular site situated on the corner of Grosvenor and York Streets.

He was a painter by profession. He joined Norges Socialdemokratiske Ungdomsforbund (NSU) in 1914, the Norwegian Labour Party in 1915. When NSU changed its name to the Young Communist League in 1921, Sørum chaired the Hedmark branch from 1922 to 1923. In 1923 he broke away from the Labour Party, joining the new Communist Party. He led the party's agitprop committee, and was an editorial board member of Proletaren from 1925 to 1927. He was a politburo member in 1929, and then from 1932. He was also a central board member; illegally so during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany which started in 1940. At the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions national convention in 1934, he forwarded a motion of no confidence against the leader, former communist Halvard Olsen. The motion received only 41 votes, but another motion from Rolf Olsen passed with 263 against 98 votes, uniting communists and \\"Tramælites\\" against the union leadership. In the late 1930s Sørum was \\"the leading trade unionist of the communists\\". In 1940 he was a member of the Trade Opposition of 1940,Pryser, 1988: p. 274 which advocated a cooperative environment between trade unions and the occupational authorities, but he eventually took the stance that the trade unions should work illegally. In 1941 he formed a committee, together with Konrad Nordahl and Lars Evensen, to prepare illegality as well as a cooperation with Labour Party unionists.Pryser, 1988: p. 314 He worked underground for the illegal (non-Nazi) part of the Union of Building Industry Workers.Pryser, 1988: p. 350 He was eventually arrested on 10 January 1943 and imprisoned in Grini concentration camp before being sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp on 27 February 1944. He remained here until the end of World War II. The communist inmates in the camp formed a caucus of sorts, and Sørum was among the leading members along with Kristian Mugaas, Johan Strand Johansen, Olaf Skramstad, Olaf Bjerke and Erling Heiestad.Pryser, 1988: p. 461 After the war, from 1946 to 1949, he was the deputy chairman of the Norwegian Union of Building Industry Workers.

The settlement was initially known as Merolia which is the Indigenous Australian name for the district. The town was eventually named after the grandson of the first chief justice of the Western Australian Supreme Court, Sir Archibald Burt. Archibald Edmund Burt JP was the chief mining warden of the Mount Margaret Goldfield. The town was gazetted as Merolia in 1902 but was regazetted to compliment Archibald Edmund Burt later the same year. Burtville, 2008 The population of the town and district rose to approximately 400 by 1903 as a result of gold mining. The town also had a water supply from a government well and a sealed pan sanitation system. A police station was opened in 1903 along with a school and two hotels. A ten stamp state battery and five stamp battery known as The Burtville Ore Reduction works were operated within the town from 1903 to 1906. Another privately owned ten stamp battery that allowed public access known as The sons of Westralia was also operating at the time. By 1916 the population had reduced to 45 and the police station was closed. All that remains of the town today is the entrance door arch of one of the town's hotels.

(2001) Regularität und Variabilität der n-Tilgung im Lëtzebuergeschen (\\"Eifeler Regel\\"). Ein unüberwachtes, induktives Lernverfahren. Magisterarbeit im Fach Computerlinguistik, Universität Trier. during the late 19th century. The rule describes a phonological process in the languages which causes the deletion of final in certain contexts, and may be reflected in spelling. More generally called n-apocope, it appears to varying extents in all dialects of the Western group of High German, including West Central German (notably Luxembourgish, Colognian and Hessian), High Franconian and Alemannic; and excludes all dialects of the Eastern group, such as Austro-Bavarian and the colonial dialects east of the Elbe-Saale line (including Standard German and Yiddish). N-apocope is a linguistic change originating in speech during the Middle High German period.Jochen Conzelmann, Erläuterungen zur mittelhochdeutschen Grammatik, Freiburg: Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, 2011.  West Central German  = Luxembourgish = The Eifel Rule is pervasive in Luxembourgish and its effects are indicated in the standard orthography. Final ⟨n⟩ or ⟨nn⟩ are often lost when followed by another consonant other than ⟨n⟩, ⟨d⟩, ⟨t⟩, ⟨z⟩ or ⟨h⟩. Compare the following examples involving the definite article den (\\"the\\"): *den Apel (\\"the apple\\"), den Tuerm (\\"the tower\\"), but de Ball (\\"the ball\\") Since Luxembourgish orthography strives for phonetic accuracy, the deletion of n is also reflected in writing. Now, the Eifeler Regel is presented as a spelling rule, but its correct application still depends on a knowledge of spoken Luxembourgish. The rule targets words ending in -n or -nn, and since that is an extremely common ending for verbs, plural nouns, and function words (e.g. articles, pronouns, prepositions) in Luxembourgish, its effects are widespread. The basic rule can be described as follows:Schanen, François & Lulling, Jérôme. (2003). Introduction à l'orthographe luxembourgeoise . The text is available in French and Luxembourgish. *Final -n(n) is deleted before another consonant. *:(between words) den + Ball → de Ball (\\"the ball\\"), wann + mer ginn → wa mer ginn (\\"when we go\\") *:(in compound words) Dammen + Schong → Dammeschong (\\"women's shoes\\") *It is not deleted, however: before the consonants n, d, t, z, or h :den Tuerm (\\"the tower\\"), wann hien drénkt (\\"when he drinks\\") :Gromperenzalot (\\"potato salad\\"), fënnefandrësseg (\\"thirty-five\\") before a vowel :den Apel (\\"the apple\\"), wann ech ginn (\\"when I go\\") :Ouerenentzündung (\\"ear infection\\") at the end of a sentence or before a punctuation mark :Ech hunn (wéi gëschter) vill geschafft. (\\"I have (like yesterday) done a lot of work.\\") *Deletion is optional before the following function words beginning in s: säin, si/se/s', sech, seng, sou (and perhaps others). It is important to know that many words ending in -n or -nn are not affected by the Eifeler Regel: *proper nouns: Schuman, Johann, München *loanwords: Roman, Maschin(n), nouns ending in -ioun *the prefix on-: onvergiesslech (\\"unforgettable\\") *most nouns and adjectives (for historical reasons): Mann (man), dënn (thin), Kroun (crown), Loun (salary), blann (blind), Reen (rain), … In fact, n as a stem consonant (as opposed to part of a grammatical ending) is generally stable in content words, with notable exceptions such as Wäi(n) (wine), Stee(n) (stone), geschwë(nn) (soon). When final -n is dropped from a plural noun whose singular form also ends in -e (which occurs mostly in loanwords), a diaeresis must be used to distinguish the plural: *Chance (singular ), Chancen (plural, full form ), Chancë (plural + Eifel Rule ) = Colognian = In Colognian, the Eifeler Regel is of lesser impact than further south. This is due in part to slight morphological differences between the Moselle Franconian languages of the upper Eifel regions (High Eifel and Schneifel), and the Ripuarian languages of the North- and Vordereifel region and the Cologne Lowland, to which Colognian belongs. There are several ways to write Colognian, and the Eifeler Regel may be reflected in writing when it follows phonetic reality, but more often is not, since the majority of people do not write very phonetically. In comparison to standard German, Colognian is often described as having historically omitted the trailing n. This is oversimplified, and not always true, but makes it necessary to note that the Colognian version of liaison sometimes inserts an n. In fact, Colognian multisyllabic base words or lexemes regularly drop \\"-n\\" when related languages, such as Standard German and neighboring dialects to the North such as Low German, Dutch and Limburgish do not. Liaison is often optional, and there is hardly any liaison on stressed words within a sentence. For example, with the words ' (up, up there) and ' (in, into), one may build the phrase: ' (up there into the cupboard) which depending on stress and voice flow inside a complete sentence is spoken as either or . The general rule is that monosyllabic words most often keep their trailing n, while otherwise -en endings are transformed to -e in Colognian unless the following word starts with a glottal stop, a dental consonant, a vocal, or an h, and neither of the two words is being stressed inside the sentence.see page 33, Variable 8, in Christa Bhatt, Markus Lindlar (editors): Alles Kölsch.

There are exceptions, the most notable being that speakers do not use liaison even if they could when speaking very slowly or solemnly, e.g. preaching or praying.  High Franconian  High Franconian is a transitional dialect group between the Rhine Franconian dialects of West Central German to the North and the Swabian dialects of Alemannic to the South. The High Franconian group divides into South Franconian and East Franconian. N-apocope can be documented in the following sentence from Standard German: *Die Kinder halte-n die Äpfel fest. \\"The children hold on to the apples.\\" The comparison with the above mentioned dialects demonstrates:Hanna Heidt, Erinnerungen an die Vergangenheit, Schwanen Stutensee-Staffort. Cf. Alfred Klepsch, Fränkische Dialekte, in: Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, 2012. *Rhine Franconian: Die Kinner halte die Äppel fescht. *South Frankonian: Die Kinner halte die Äpfel fescht. *East Frankonian: Die Kinner halte die Äpfel fest. *Swabian: Die Kinner haltet die Äpfel fescht.  Alemannic  The Eifeler Regel (Alemannic n-apocope) applies in all variants of Alemannic in the same fashion as described for Luxembourgish and is subject to the same exceptions.Peter Auer, \\"Co-occurrence restrictions between linguistic variables: A case for social dialectology, phonological theory and variation studies\\", in; Frans Hinskens & Roeland Van Hout (eds), Variation, Change and Phonological Theory, John Benjamins Publishing, 1997, pp. 69-99; Nübling, Damaris & Renate Schrambke, \\"Silben- versus akzentsprachliche Züge in germanischen Sprachen und im Alemannischen\\", Alemannisch im Sprachvergleich, Elvira Glaser et al., pp. 281-320, Stuttgart: Steiner Verlag, 2004; Schwarz, Christian & Tobias Streck, \\"Neue Ansätze zur Beschreibung phonologischen Wandels in den alemannischen Dialekten Südwestdeutschlands: n-Tilgung und Realisierung von mhd. ô\\", Zeitschrift für Dialektologie und Linguistik - Beiheft 141, 2010, pp. 203-218. The earliest report on the phenomenon in Alemannic goes back to 1881.Karl Weinhold, Kleine mittelhochdeutsche Grammatik, Vienna: Wilhelm Braumüller, 1881, p. 29. *Certain Swiss German dialects also exhibit Eifeler Regel. A comparison, in Zurich German, would be: \\"Wötsch en Äpfe?\\" remains as \\"Wötsch en Äpfe?\\" (\\"Do you want an apple?\\"), but \\"Wötsch en Gipfel?\\" changes to \\"Wötsch e Gipfel?\\" (\\"Do you want a croissant?\\").  Low Franconian  Certain southern and southeastern dialects of Low Franconian (that is, Dutch) have a similar phenomenon. It is notable in Limburgish and some areas of Brabantian, and is called the \\"bdht-vowel-rule\\". Final -n is also deleted in these dialects, except when followed by b, d, h, t or a vowel, in case of a masculine noun. This is similar to the Eifeler regel.

Travunia was a polity centered in Trebinje (now in southern Bosnia and Herzegovina), subject to the Principality of Serbia. Mentioned in De Administrando Imperio () of Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII (r. 945–959), Beloje was a contemporary of Serbian ruler Vlastimir (r. 836–851). It is unknown how he came to the position; it might have been through the primogeniture principles, however, there is no definite answer. Vlastimir married his daughter to Beloje's son Krajina, and \\"desiring to ennoble his son-in-law\\", elevated his rank to archon (prince) and made him independent. Travunia was thus elevated from a župa into an archonty (principality), practically independent, while Vlastimir oversaw his son-in-law. T. Živković theorized that Beloje sought to free himself of Serbian rule, and that Vlastimir prevented this through a political marriage between the two families, possibly prior to the Bulgar–Serb War (839–842). Krajina's descendants were entitled the rule of Travunia under Serbian suzerainty. There is a hypothesis that the legendary king Pavlimir Belo (or Belimir) mentioned in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja () was possibly based on Beloje. The CPD is a source dating to ca. 1300–10 largely discredited in historiography (events in the Early Middle Ages deemed useless). The CPD mentions this individual, Belo, as being born as Pavlimir, receiving his nickname from his relatives and other Romans from bello, \\"because he very much loved war\\". The legend of Pavlimir-Belo continues with his stint at Syrmia, where he defeated the Syrmians and Hungarians, and his defeat of Rascian župan Ljutomir. Belo is mentioned in the CPD as a Rascian župan, while DAI mentions Beloje as a Travunian župan. N. Banašević noted that while the two names were similar, they were not identical.

It forms a social housing commitment developed as part of the nearby Pan Peninsula project. Design Phoenix Heights consists of 199 mixed tenure homes with integral community areas significantly having a high proportion of family homes with access to outdoor space in such a high-density location. The development varies in height from 3 to 23 storeys negotiating an abrupt shift in urban scale from the Barkantine Estate to the West with the emerging Millennium Quarter to the East. Family-sized units are located at the base of the building having direct access to rear gardens, a playground and communal courtyard areas. Smaller sized units are located higher up in the towers enjoying views across London from roof terraces and balconies. A community space was designed as an integral part of the project and incorporates a rooftop sports pitch. The development makes use of a local 'Combined Heat and Power' system and includes greenwalls, bird boxes, bat boxes, insect bricks and biodiversity roofs to help develop local eco-systems. The distinctive skyline and elevations of the building include coloured fibre cement cladding panels, large overhanging canopies and projecting balconies which contrast with the restrained aesthetic of Canary Wharf. Piers Gough described the development as 'humanist architecture of raw funky collage'. The project was designed by Brady Mallalieu Architects and was developed by the Irish property firm Ballymore. The social and shared ownership housing was managed by the housing association One Housing which subsequently acquired the freehold in 2016. The building won a 2010 Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) award for 'Best Overseas Project' and an Evening Standard Award for 'Best New Development in the Affordable Homes Sector'.

The station is one of two stations at the airport to be served by the Arlanda Express, the other being Arlanda North Station. The station is located inside a tunnel below the airport and is served by four or five trains per hour. The station serves Terminal 2, 3 and 4 of the airport. The station is from Stockholm Central Station. Service The station is only served by the Arlanda Express, a dedicated airport rail link which connects the airport to Stockholm Central Station. The train normally operates four times every hour, but during rush hour this is increased to five times per hour. Travel time to Stockholm is 18 minutes. Standard price for a one-way ticket is 299 SEK, although discounts are offered for children, students, seniors, on special travel days and for return trips under certain conditions. The Arlanda Express is operated by A-Train, a subsidiary of Macquarie Group. The Arlanda Express operate using X3 high-speed trains. In addition, regional and intercity trains call at Arlanda Central Station. History Plans for a railway line from the city center of Stockholm to the airport started in the early 1980s. Policy-makers wanted to allow the airport to grow without increasing the road traffic to the airport, and decided to build a railway. The project involved building a branch from the existing East Coast Line from Rosersberg and back at Odensala. Financing was secured by introducing Sweden's first public–private partnership, whereby a private consortium would be granted a 40-year permit to operate the line in exchange for all direct traffic and the right to collect usage fees from other train companies. The contract was won by A-Train in 1994, which started construction in 1995 and opened the line and station on 25 November 1999.

In November 2007, Parkteatret was awarded the Olavsrosa seal of quality by the foundation Norsk Kulturarv. Parkteatret, Olaf Ryes plass 1 Arkitektur og historie i Oslo History The cinema was designed by the architect Frithjof Aslesen (1854-1921). In 1913 the establishment changed its name to \\"Grünerløkkens Verdenstheater\\". In 1918-22 it went through a major structural transformation and the cinema got its current name. The new facade was built in the neoclassical style by the architect Erik Glosimodt (1881-1921). The artistic decoration of 1932 was done by the painter Paul Ansteinsson (1885-1939), simultaneously as architect Jens Dunker (1892-1981) redesigned the interior. The external neon lights were first switched on in the 1960s. Parkteatret cinema was a municipal cinema from 1926 through 1991. From 1992 to 2001 the establishment housed the Nordic Black Theatre. In 2002 Parkteatret Scene started leasing the building, behind this new establishment was Geir Johnson, director of the Ultima Oslo Contemporary Music Festival, and Pål Steigan.

Early years  He was of Abkhaz (or Abazin) origin. According to one source, his father was a sea captain named Pervane.Ayhan Buz: Osmanlı Sadrazamları, Neden Kitap, İstanbul, 2009, p.107 During the reign of Murad IV, he was appointed as the governor of Diyarbakır. During Ibrahim's reign, he was appointed to the governorships of Erzurum, Mosul, Aleppo and Damascus. In 1644, he married to Kaya Sultan, Murad's daughter, and gained the title damat (groom). But all of the provinces (even Erzurum a part of Turkey) he was assigned, were quite far from Istanbul, the capital, and during most of his assignments, his wife stayed in Istanbul. During the reign of Mehmed IV, he finally returned to Istanbul as a vizier. But in 1650, to the dismay of his wife, he was appointed as the governor of Baghdad, another post far from Istanbul. Kaya Sultan tried to persuade the queen regent to revoke the decision. But she couldn't succeed, a sign of the chaos in Ottoman palace.An essay on Ahmet Pasha Nevertheless, before Melek Ahmed left Istanbul, the Grand Vizier Kara Murat Pasha resigned, complaining of the intrigues of the palace people. The queen regent offered the post to Melek Ahmed, who accepted the offer on the condition that the palace people would not meddle with the governance of the state on 5 August 1650.Joseph von Hammer:Osmanlı Tarihi Vol II (condensation: Abdülkadir Karahan), Milliyet yayınları, İstanbul. p 100 He was the brother-in-law of the Haydarzade Mehmed Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Egypt from 1646 to 1647, who married his sister.  Grand Vizier  When Melek Ahmed took office, he realized that the empire was almost bankrupt. The Cretan War (1645–1669) was very costly, and tax revenues from Anatolia were much less than the expected amount because of the Jelali revolts. He attempted to balance the budget, but without a real knowledge of financial affairs, his economic measures worsened the economy instead of improving it. Among his measures was the debasing of coinage by reducing the gold content. This caused reactions among both the merchants and the soldiers, whose salaries were paid by the new coins.Prof.Yaşar Yücel-Prof Ali Sevim:Türkiye tarihi III, AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, 1991, pp 104-106 The sultan was forced to relieve him of his post on 22 August 1651.  Later years  After 1651, he was again assigned as a provincial governor, but this time in Silistra (now in Bulgaria), much closer to capital. Soon, he was able to return to Istanbul. In 1654, Mustafa İbşir Pasha had been appointed as the Grand Vizier, but delayed his arrival in Istanbul. During this period, Melek Ahmed functioned as his deputy. This aroused İbşir Pasha's suspicions, and Melek Ahmed was exiled to Van and Malkara. However, after İbşir Pasha was deposed, Melek Ahmed Pasha was able to regain his former titles. After working in some provinces in the European part of the empire, he was married for a second time to Fatma Sultan (the daughter of the late sultan Ahmed I) in 1662. According to Evliya Çelebi, the marriage was unhappy and forced upon both parties; Fatma Sultan reportedly threatened Melek Ahmed Pasha with divorce and the withdrawal of her dowry (which was reportedly worth an entire year's tax revenue from the Egypt Eyalet). Melek Ahmed Pasha died in 1662, only months after marrying Fatma Sultan.  Aftermath  In the Ottoman Empire, the minting of devalued coinage continued after 1651 and provided the major reason for a wide-scale rebellion, the Çınar Incident, in 1656.  Evliya Çelebi and Melek Ahmed Pasha  Although not a particularly successful Grand Vizier, details about both Melek Ahmed Pasa and his wife Kaya Sultan (as well as his later marriage to Fatma Sultan) are well known because of Evliya Çelebi's books. Evliya Çelebi was one of the most important Turkish travel writers of his time, and his mother was the milk-sister of Melek Ahmed Pasha, and Evliya Çelebi used this opportunity to travel with Melek Ahmed Pasha.On line history See also * List of Ottoman Grand Viziers References Category:17th-century Grand Viziers of the Ottoman Empire Category:Abazins Category:1662 deaths Category:People from Galata Category:Pashas Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:People of the Ottoman Empire of Abkhazian descent Category:1604 births Category:Ottoman governors of Aleppo ","title":"Melek Ahmed Pasha"},{"id":"29560605","text":"Annunciation to the shepherds (circa 1641) Adoration by the shepherds (1641) David Colijns (1582-c.1665) was a Dutch Golden Age painter.

The station is one of two stations at the airport to be served by the Arlanda Express, the other being Arlanda South Station. The station is located inside a tunnel below the airport and is served by four or five trains per hour. The station serves Terminal 5 of the airport. The station is from Stockholm Central Station. Service The station is only served by the Arlanda Express, a dedicated airport rail link which connects the airport to Stockholm Central Station. The train normally operates four times every hour, but during rush hour this is increased to six times per hour. Travel time to Stockholm is 20 minutes. Standard price for a one-way ticket is 299 SEK, although discounts are offered for children, students, seniors, on special travel days and for return trips under certain conditions. The Arlanda Express is operated by A-Train, a subsidiary of Macquarie Group. The Arlanda Express operate using X3 high-speed trains. In addition, regional and intercity trains call at Arlanda Central Station. History Plans for a railway line from the city center of Stockholm to the airport started in the early 1980s. Policy-makers wanted to allow the airport to grow without increasing the road traffic to the airport, and decided to build a railway. The project involved building a branch from the existing East Coast Line from Rosersberg and back at Odensala. Financing was secured by introducing Sweden's first public–private partnership, whereby a private consortium would be granted a 40-year permit to operate the line in exchange for all direct traffic and the right to collect usage fees from other train companies. The contract was won by A-Train in 1994, which started construction in 1995 and opened the line and station on 25 November 1999. This made Arlanda Airport the first airport in Sweden and the fourth in the Nordic countries to have an airport rail link, after Trondheim Airport, Værnes and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen in Norway, and Copenhagen Airport in Denmark.

The Spiritual national defence (German: Geistige Landesverteidigung; French: Défense [nationale] spirituelle) was a political-cultural movement in Switzerland which was active from circa 1932 into the 1960s. It was supported by the Swiss authorities, certain institutions, scholars, the press and intellectuals. Its aim was the strengthening of values and customs perceived to be ‘Swiss’ and thus create a defence against totalitarian ideologies. The movement first directed its attention towards National Socialism and fascism. Later during the Cold War, Swiss spiritual national defence took a stance against communism. Even when the movement was no longer actively promoted by the authorities, it remained alive well into the 1980s. Today Swiss politicians frequently still use terms and metaphors from the spiritual defence ideology. History On 19 June 1935, a social democrat member of the National Council, Fritz Hauser, put forward a postulate in which he called upon the Federal Council to examine how the spiritual independence of culture in Switzerland could be defended in the face of the threat from fascist movements in Germany. One week later, the Swiss Society of Writers (Felix Moeschlin, Karl Naef) presented Federal Councillor Philipp Etter with a proposal for a Swiss cultural policy. The Social Democratic Party of Switzerland gave its approval to the defence proposal – subject to the following condition: \\"Combating all trends in domestic politics which, in contradiction to the will of the Swiss people, aspire to a diminution of the democratic rights of freedom and self-determination of the citizens and the removal of the influence of the constitutional authorities over the state and its policy.\\" The 1936 Social Democratic Party conference held in Zürich, however, rejected a defence loan. However, unconditional recognition of the legitimacy of national defence followed in January 1937 with the party’s adoption of the ‘Richtlinienbewegung’ (Movement of Guiding Principles). Statement of the Federal Council regarding Spiritual Defence A document of the Federal Council was published on 9 December 1938 relating to the organisation and the task of safeguarding and promoting Swiss culture. This called for the creation under civil law of a cultural foundation to be known as Pro Helvetia, a body which would receive state subsidies. It would guarantee the defence of the common spiritual values of Switzerland in order to counterbalance ‘state sponsored propaganda from neighbouring countries'. :\\"While the armed defence of the nation, together with the preparation and organisation of such defence, is exclusively a matter of the state – indeed its primary duty – we wish to leave the spiritual defence of the nation primarily in the hands of the citizen. The state should have the necessary means at its disposal, and retain the right to oversee the use of these means. But apart from this, the spiritual forces of the nation should mobilise and deploy themselves in a common defensive front.\\" National Socialism and the Second World War The call for a spiritual defence of Swiss democracy against fascism through radio and film originated in left wing circles and became all the more relevant with the rise to power of Hitler in 1933. The latter event completed the encirclement of Switzerland, for its neighbours, with the exception of France, were at that time all governed by authoritarian fascist regimes. In this first phase, spiritual defence had a definite anti-German tone: the specific Swiss character, as opposed to that of Germany, was to be given primary emphasis. A special form of spiritual defence was illustrated by the so-called 'Elvetismo' (cp. Helvetism) movement in Canton Ticino which opposed Italian Irredentism. Here the emphasis was placed on the specific character of Ticino as opposed to that of Italy. The central thrust of spiritual defence was the creation of an ethnic community in Switzerland. This meant the overcoming of class antagonisms and the creation of a Swiss identity – a community of destiny – which would encompass the cultural differences and the four national languages. The term “Helvetic totalitarianism”, as expressed by the Swiss historian Hans Ulrich Jost, falls short for it refers solely to the civil form of spiritual defence. From 1938, the term was adopted officially by the Swiss Federal Council. Federal Councillor Philipp Etter in a pivotal paper placed his primary emphasis upon the affiliation of Switzerland to the three dominant European cultural spheres: cultural diversity, the federal nature of democracy and the reverence accorded to the dignity and freedom of man. The Swiss National Exhibition held in Zurich in 1939 is regarded as the most effective expression of spiritual defence. The so-called “Landigeist” (homeland spirit) flooded through the land and – coming shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War – gave people a feeling of an unbroken national will for independence against all the demands of Germany and the annexation of the German-speaking cantons into a Greater German Reich. This was especially relevant now that Austria and the Sudetenland had been taken over. The main problem faced by spiritual defence was the influx of state-directed German and Italian propaganda – mainly in the form of radio broadcasts, books and magazines – which had an influence on Switzerland. To counteract these influences, private and governmental cultural institutions were created for the purpose of putting out \\"Swiss\\" propaganda: among these were \\"Pro Helvetia\\" [created in 1939], \\"Neue Helvetische Gesellschaft\\" (\\"New Helvetic Society\\") [created in 1914] and \\"Heer und Haus\\" (\\"Army and Home\\") [created in November 1939]. The Swiss film industry was heavily promoted in order to cultivate the notion of spiritual defence among cinema audiences. The most important of such films were: \\"Füsilier Wipf\\" (by Leopold Lindtberge, 1938) and \\"Landammann Stauffacher (1941) as well as Franz Schnyder's \\"Gilberte de Courgenay\\" (1941). During the Second World War, spiritual defence was strengthened by censorship, which came under the \\"Abteilung Presse und Funkspruch\\" (Department of press and broadcasting). Cold war After the Second World War, the movement remained active with its thrust directed towards the danger of communist infiltration. Whereas the Federal Council had adopted a relatively muted and accommodating approach to National Socialism before 1945 (as exemplified by the ominous speech of the Federal President, Marcel Pilet-Golaz, in June 1940) the Council adopted a more defiant tone immediately after the war, stating that the NS leadership must be ‘ruthlessly eradicated’. Echoing the anti-communist spirit of the times, emphasis was placed upon a constitutional democracy and welfare state, and the part-time ('militia-like') character of a powerful Swiss army. Spiritual defence led increasingly to an attitude of mind known as bunker mentality, a political and spiritual isolationism and a militarization of the civil society. Strong criticism from cultural and intellectual circles forced the Swiss authorities to abandon the official promotion of Spiritual defence after 1962. Nevertheless, the Swiss army kept up the pressure for a will of national defence, and propagated the notion of Switzerland’s unconditional dependence on a numerically strong and well equipped militia – this to exist alongside unconditional political and economic neutrality. After effects The Federal Council continued to use the term Spiritual defence in its vocabulary and pictorial language during the campaign leading up to the 1989 referendum to decide whether Switzerland should retain an army or become demilitarised. (see Group for a Switzerland Without an Army.) The celebrations in 1989 to mark the 50th jubilee of mobilisation continued in the same vein. The occasion of the 60th, diamond jubilee, was supposed to reawaken the spirit of the “active service generation” (those who had been mobilised during the Second World War) in advance of a ballot to decide on the procurement of new equipment for the army. In this connection it is significant that Switzerland was the only country to celebrate mobilisation rather than a peace settlement. Political parties, too – primarily right wing parties such as the Swiss People's Party – still make use of ideas from the Spiritual defence movement to oppose European integration or any Überfremdung of Switzerland. This happened during the referendum over the proposed adhesion of Switzerland to the European Economic Community in 1992 and in the campaign against Swiss participation in the 2005 Schengen Agreement and Dublin Regulation. Furthermore, other less known aspects of the post war Spiritual defence movement still survive unchallenged, namely the notion of a social market economy or a social partnership. :Imagination is also quite a rare gift. In the years to come, the majority of our people will not wish to consider – no more than was the case in 1920, 1930 or even later – if and how our nation could again be threatened. What we have done, especially since 1933, to arouse our nation from its lethargy and to call upon its conscience and its vigilance will have to be done again and again. :– General Henri Guisan'' See also *Cabaret Cornichon *Gilberte de Courgenay (German :de:Gilberte de Courgenay) and (French :fr:Gilberte de Courgenay) *National Redoubt (Switzerland) References External links The above is a translation of the article in the German Wikipedia at :de:Geistige Landesverteidigung * * Marco Zanoli: Zwischen Klassenkampf, Pazifismus und Geistiger Landesverteidigung.

Johannes Glauber Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature After the death of his father, he travelled with his brother Johannes Gottlieb Glauber and the two brothers Van DorenHuig van Dorre Wiltschut was one of these brothers from Rotterdam, see the RKD entry by boat to Paris, where he stayed a year painting for Mr. Picart, an art dealer on the Pont Neuf who was a flower painter from the Low Countries. Then he travelled to Lyon, where he stayed for two years painting for Adriaen van der Kabel. He then travelled to Italy with his brother and two French painters. After 6 months in Rome he joined the Bentvueghels with the nickname Coridon, but since he knew that name had already been given to Van der Cabel, they changed it to Polidoor (after the landscape painter Polidoro da Caravaggio). He was friends with Karel Dujardin in Rome, who didn't want to join the Bentvueghels, but who received the somewhat negative nickname Bokkebaard (goatee) anyway. According to Houbraken another painter who didn't want to become a member after receiving an invitation received the epithet Platluizenbaard or lice-beard. After 2 years in Rome he set off for Padua with his brother and the Flemish painter Robbert Duval, where they stayed a year. After that they travelled to Venice, where they stayed two years. They finally left Italy in 1679 and went north to Hamburg, where they lived until 1684 except for a short stay in Copenhagen when Johannes went to work for Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve, Count of Laurvig on decorations fot Charlottenborg Palace. After 1684 Johannes left his brother to return to Amsterdam, where he lived with Gerard de Lairesse and made wall decorations for various large homes and estates, including Soestdijk Palace, where he was assisted by Albert Meijeringh and Dirk Maas. Houbraken also mentions the house of Jacob de Flines on Herengracht 132, which Glauber helped decorate along with De Lairesse and Frederick de Moucheron. That house burned in 2008, but the wall paintings had been removed in 1910 and are located today in Beeckestijn.article about Herengracht 132, Amsterdam A ceiling decoration that Glauber made for Herengracht 446 (home of Andries de Graeff) was sold at auction in 1903 and is installed today at the Peace Palace in the Hague.Amsterdam archives Houbraken also mentioned decorations for gentlemen in Rotterdam 'in the style of De Lairesse'.

Sims was raised in the Catholic Church but stopped attending church at the age of 16. Sims lived in seventeen states before settling in Pennsylvania in the early 1990s. He later completed his undergraduate studies at Bloomsburg University, in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in 2001. In 2000, Sims was the co-captain of the Bloomsburg University football team, and was recognized as a scholar athlete. During the 2000 season, the longest season in the Division II school's history, Sims came out as gay to his teammates. In doing so, the regional All- American and team captain became the only openly gay college football captain in NCAA history. In 2004, Sims earned a J.D. Degree in International and Comparative law at the Michigan State University School of Law. In 2013, Sims completed Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government as a David Bohnett LGBTQ Victory Institute Leadership Fellow.

In 2009, Sims joined the faculty of the Center for Progressive Leadership and the National Campaign Board of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund. He was selected as one of the Top 40 LGBT Attorneys Under 40 in the United States by the National LGBT Bar Association in 2010. =Planned Parenthood confrontation= Sims received attention in 2019 for videos he posted to social media confronting people protesting outside of a Planned Parenthood facility in Philadelphia. In April of that year, Sims offered $100 to anyone who could dox three protesters. A few weeks later, in May, Sims posted another eight-minute video of himself confronting a woman who was protesting by praying with a rosary outside the same facility. He suggested it was unchristian and racist to \\"shame\\" people engaging in a lawful activity. He encouraged his social media followers to dox her and protest outside her house. Sims also criticized Catholicism by referring to its record on child molestation. Following the incidents, more than one thousand anti-abortion protesters rallied outside the facility, with many calling for Sims' resignation. He responded to calls for an apology or that he resign by calling critics bigoted, sexist, and misogynistic \\"Bible Bullies\\". Sims admitted to being \\"aggressive\\" in his confrontation. Career Before assuming public office, Sims served as staff counsel for policy and planning at the Philadelphia Bar Association. During his time at the Bar Association, Sims worked with attorneys, legislators and community organizations on issues ranging from gender and pay inequity to environmental regulation. =Pennsylvania House of Representatives= In 2011, Sims announced his intentions to run for representative of the 182nd Legislative District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Sims defeated Babette Josephs, a 28-year incumbent, in the 2012 Democratic primary. He did not face a Republican challenger in the November general election and was elected. Sims was the first openly gay person elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly.

Steve McCarter introduced legislation to legalize same-sex marriage in Pennsylvania. Sims has also introduced a bill with fellow Democratic State Representative Erin Molchany to help reduce and eliminate the gender gap in rate of pay as well as legislation to ban the practice of conversion therapy with Rep. Gerald Mullery. Sims has also made efforts to work with federal legislators on issues of LGBT civil rights. On March 28, 2013, Sims penned an open letter to U.S. Senator and fellow Pennsylvania Democrat Bob Casey Jr. urging him to come out publicly in support of same-sex marriage. This, combined with many other calls, ultimately resulted in the senator voicing his support for the measure. Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) also chose to vote for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in the U.S. Senate after Sims and a number of other activists wrote to him on the matter. On November 11, 2013, Sims teamed with Republican State Representative Bryan Cutler to introduce a bill to replace Pennsylvania's system of electing judges with a merit-based system, which did not receive debate in the PA House.

Collaboration with Lal Waterson After buying a four-track machine, Knight started experimenting with recording music, leaving home temporarily and playing in various blues and rock cover bands, but moving back to his parents' house in 1993. His mother had been asked to provide a track for a sampler CD for the musicians' co-op No Masters, to highlight the songwriting talent they had in their organisation. \\"Mum and I had played songs together in the past and we were always saying to each other, \\"What do you think to this track or that\\", but it wasn't until she asked me to play guitar for her on Midnight Feast that we clicked.\\" Oliver developed a writing partnership with his mother and eventually they collaboratively recorded the studio album Once in a Blue Moon released in 1996 to much acclaim, with a vinyl reissue in 2009. Lal Waterson died in 1998, just before their second album, A Bed Of Roses, was finished. The material was fully recorded already, and it was released posthumously.  Live Sound  In 1994, Knight decided to branch out as a live sound engineer and his first job was with a band called The Whisky Priests. \\"Two months touring Germany was a good way to learn your trade\\", says Oliver. \\"I remember the first gig very well, we were two and a half hours late, the band should have been on at 8:30 and we arrived at 9:00 so it was straight on the stage and go. Live sound is very different to studio work, as I quickly realised. As the house engineer knew the band were bringing their own guy, he had left to get his tea. When he came back, he came running over to me shouting \\"What the ... are you doing, that sounds terrible!\\" So he sorted it out, and by the end of the two months I knew what I was doing. I did another three-month tour with them in Germany, and owe a lot to those guys for the experience.\\"  Panda Sound  The song \\"Midnight Feast\\" was recorded at a studio in North Dalton called Panda Sound (P.A. North Dalton Associates), owned and run by Ray Williams. Knight was instantly taken by the recording process and becoming a sound engineer, and although still working as a gardener, whenever Williams had a session in he would invite Knight to help him and teach him all he could. Around 1995, Ray Williams decided to sell the studio to Oliver. Relocating the studio to Robin Hood's Bay, Knight soon gained a good reputation for studio work and live sound, working in other studios and touring in America, Canada and Europe. In 1996, Knight left his gardening job and became a full-time self-employed sound engineer. Over the course of working at Panda Sound, Knight has recorded over 120 albums. Oliver tour- managed and was live sound engineer for Kate & Anna McGarrigle.  Marry Waterson  In 2002, Knight released his solo album Mysterious Day with various guest vocalists. In 2006, he was involved with the band Van Eyken. He recorded and co-produced their album Stiffs Lovers Holymen Thieves, from which the track \\"Barleycorn\\" won Best Traditional Track in the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2007. In 2007, The Waterson Family were asked to create a show to be performed at The Royal Albert Hall and later that year Knight, along with James Yorkston, coordinated the show A Tribute To Lal Waterson for the BBC Electric Proms. These two shows marked the start of Waterson-Knight working together, leading to their album The Days That Shaped Me in 2011. Their second album Hidden was released in September 2012.  Personal life  Knight is married to Helen, with a child Mae. Knight and his family moved out of Robin Hood's Bay and now live in the neighbouring village of Fylingthorpe. In 2008, Knight decided to take a break from live sound and tour managing, took a condensed course and became an electrician. \\"My dad has been an electrician for 25 years so we now work together and I fit the music side of things in between.”  Discography  * Once in a Blue Moon (1996) (with Lal Waterson) * A Bed of Roses (1998) (with Lal Waterson) * Mysterious Day (2002)\\"Oliver Knight Mysterious Day.(Sound Recording Review)\\" Sing Out! : 1 January 2003 * The Days That Shaped Me (2011) (with Marry Waterson) * Hidden (2012) (with Marry Waterson) References Category:Living people Category:British singer- songwriters Category:1969 births Category:Musicians from Kingston upon Hull Category:People from the Borough of Scarborough ","title":"Oliver Knight"},{"id":"29560827","text":"The Suseo–Pyeongtaek high-speed railway or Super Rapid Train (SRT) (formerly known as the Suseo HSR or Metropolitan Area HSR) is a high-speed rail line from Suseo in southeast Seoul to a junction with the existing Gyeongbu high- speed railway in South Korea. To stimulate competition rather than handing operation of the Suseo line to incumbent Korail, a separate company was formed. Today Korail is the primary shareholder, however SRT tickets are not available from the Korail website. In effect there is very little difference between KTX and SRT service s other than the Seoul terminus. Passengers travelling to downtown Seoul will find KTX trains to Seoul Station more convenient. Passengers bound for Gangnam and the area south of the Han River will find SRT trains more convenient. SRT trains offer an alternative Seoul gateway for Gyeongbu KTX and Honam KTX services to Mokpo and Busan at the Seoul end. SRT trains use the same stations as KTX trains in Busan, Mokpo and all other cities. Around 86% of the new route runs 50 meters underground. Dongtan station, the first station after departing from Suseo, is the first underground high-speed railway station in Korea. The SRT runs the Seoul−Busan route a few minutes faster than KTX, while its fares are 10% lower. History =Origins of the project= While South Korea's first high-speed line, the Gyeongbu high-speed railway (Gyeongbu HSR) was in construction between Seoul and Busan, the government considered a second line from Seoul to Mokpo, the Honam high-speed railway (Honam HSR). The first feasibility study in 2003 came to the conclusion that the construction of a full line is not justified by demand, and proposed a two-stage construction. The first stage, to be realised by 2015, would involve two branches from the Gyeongbu HSR, one of which would lead to a second Seoul terminus at Suseo in the southeast part of the city. However, in plans made official in August 2006, the Suseo branch was no longer included. The Suseo branch was re-launched as a separate project, the Metropolitan Area high-speed railway (initially the Suseo high- speed railway), on June 1, 2008, to improve traffic connections to two new housing development areas situated along the line in Dongtan. =Planning stage= Preliminary plans foresaw a long line from Suseo to the junction with the Gyeongbu HSR near Pyeongtaek, and three new KTX stations at Suseo, Dongtan and Pyeongtaek, with the last one situated after the junction on the Gyeongbu HSR. The line was to run in a tunnel at a depth of between Suseo and Dongtan, and construction with a budget of 4.18 trillion South Korean won was foreseen to be complete in 2015. The travel time from Suseo to Dongtan was foreseen to be 12 minutes. The target date for finishing the line was later moved ahead to 2014. The basic design was completed on April 28, 2010. The planned length of the line changed to , and planned stations reduced to two, at Suseo and Dongtan. The government set out a timeplan, according to which detailed design was to commence immediately, and construction was to take place from the second half of 2011 until the end of 2014. The first detailed design contracts were awarded in September 2010. Once the line is completed, the expected travel time will be 1 hour 59 minutes from Suseo to Busan along the Gyeongbu HSR, and 1 hour 49 minutes from Suseo to Mokpo along the Honam HSR. =Current stage= SRT service currently runs between Suseo and Busan on the Gyeongbu HSR, and Suseo to Mokpo on the Honam HSR. However, most trains on the latter line terminate at Gwangjusongjeong, two stops before Mokpo, the reason being that the Gwangju-Mokpo section of the line has not been upgraded to high-speed service. Mandatory stops are Suseo, Daejeon, Dongdaegu, Busan (Gyeongbu), Iksan, Gwangjusongjeong, and Mokpo (Honam). Intermediate stops are Dongtan, Jije, Cheonanasan, Osong, Gimcheon(Gumi), Singyeongju, Ulsan, Gongju, Jeongup, and Naju. =Rolling stock= The SRT network is serviced by the second and third batch of KTX-Sancheon train sets (Classes 120000 and 130000) on loan from Korail. Class 120000 trains originally operated under the name KTX before being switched over to SR, and Class 130000 trains were built only for SR use. The train sets are almost identical in terms of exterior, but have a beige- purple color scheme in contrast to the white-blue of KTX trains. The train sets consist of two power cars and eight passenger cars. Occasionally, on the Gyeongbu line, two sets will be combined for the entire journey from Seoul to Busan for a total of 16 passenger cars to accommodate more passengers. =Longer term plans= On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, tracks for up to are to connect Suseo and Yongsan in central Seoul, which may see KTX service.

Suhm accepted, and stayed on in Trondheim, with a short interval in Copenhagen in 1755, for the next nine years, where she died and Suhm and his wife moved back to Copenhagen. The inherited wealth allowed Suhm a life devoted to the sciences and his bookcollection.

Established in 1946, it works to identify and draw attention to the dangers of fire and the means by which their potential for occurrence and loss is kept to a minimum. Recognized as an independent and authoritative source of fire safety information and advice it offers education and training, a fire risk assessment service, a nationwide risk management survey service for insurers, a membership journal (Fire Risk Management), all underpinned by proactive research consultancy conducted on behalf of insurers and commercial clients. History In 1880 the UK insurance industry, represented by the British Insurance Association (now the Association of British Insurers), formed the Fire Offices Committee (FOC) for the purposes of insurance tariff setting and technical support, and the Fire Protection Association (FPA) for information dissemination. In 1935 the FOC set up a test laboratory on the outskirts of London at Borehamwood,BRE Group, The Fire Research Station - FRS - a brief history, accessed 18 August 2020 which at the start of World War II was taken over by the government as the Fire Research Station (FRS), with the FOC’s technical department being represented by a combined group called the Joint Fire Research Organisation (JFRO). In the early 1980s, aided by the ABI, there was a parting of the ways to address the often incompatible issues of ‘life safety’ versus ‘business and property protection’, and the technical arm of FOC formed the Fire Insurer’s Research and Testing Organisation (FIRTO). FRS remained a government organisation until it was absorbed into the Building Research Establishment (BRE). In 1984 FIRTO combined with the FOC technical department, FPA, and the Insurers Technical Bureau (ITB) to form the Loss Prevention Council (LPC) which later went on to develop a certification body called the Loss Prevention Certification Board (LPCB). In 1999 UK insurers sold LPC Laboratories and LPCB to BRE, retaining the Fire Protection Association which relocated to offices at Blackfriars in London. Many of FPA’s current staff have over the years worked for a number of the aforementioned organisations. With its roots firmly in the insurance sector, one of FPA’s primary roles is to encourage convergence of government (life safety) and insurer (life safety and business and property protection) fire protection perspectives. Where government statutory requirements are considered inadequate by insurers for business and property protection, the FPA develops and maintains a number of key insurer standards for the implementation of active and passive fire protection requirements, together with a substantial library of Risk Control documents. FPA relocated to the Fire Service College at Moreton-in-Marsh in Gloucestershire in 2004 - placing it firmly at the heart of the UK fire industry. Function The agreed aims and objectives of the FPA are: •To protect people and property and the environment by advancing fire prevention and protection techniques •To collaborate with central Government, the Fire Service and other agencies in this work •To focus national and European attention on these issues •To influence consumers and business related decision making •To collect, analyse and publish statistics, identify trends and provide research •To disseminate advice and information Structure FPA operates via two Divisions, each led by a Director. The Commercial Division encompasses the publications, Fire Risk Management journal, fire risk assessment, risk surveying and training activities while the Technical Division undertakes research, and consultancy in support of all aspects of fire prevention and protection. The FPA supplies publications in the fields of fire safety, fire prevention and related topics. The range covers a wide variety of products including videos, DVDs, CDs and online services, books, codes of practice, recommendations, reports, leaflets, pocket cards and posters. The Training Department currently offers approximately 55 different courses covering fire safety management, fire safety engineering, health and safety and N/SVQs in fire safety. This is in addition to organising regular topical seminars and bespoke training tailored to clients’ specific requirements.

Integration warehouses are quite often used in the reinsurance industry instead of conventional data warehouses. History The concept of integration warehousing dates back to mid 2000. In the reinsurance industry it became quite obvious that data warehouses didn't cover all the business requirements and therefore IT started to focus more on the integration aspects. This finally led to solutions that now specifically fit the reinsurance business requirements. Architecture The integration warehouse architecture is quite similar to the data warehouse architecture. The main difference is in the integration aspect and the overall data model which is based on a holistic reinsurance business model.

When Mischa insists they take a break from their relationship, Steve invites colleague and friend-of-sorts Rob Brydon. On the trip, Coogan has a number of one-night stands, but is miserable professionally and personally, despite being the bigger star; Brydon, with his young family, is more content and laid-back. The two argue and attempt to outdo and humiliate each other with their impersonations of famous figures including Michael Caine and Sean Connery. In the second series, Rob and Steve are commissioned to do another restaurant tour, this time in Italy from Piedmont to Capri, following in the footsteps of the great Romantic poets in the early 19th century on the Grand Tour.. While on the tour, Rob wins a part in an American Michael Mann film. In the third series, Rob and Steve are commissioned to do another restaurant tour, this time in Spain. The fourth series is set in Greece where Rob and Steve conduct a restaurant tour that follows the path of the Odyssey.

The system contains a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star that is one of the most massive and most luminous stars known, and is also a bright x-ray source due to colliding winds with a less massive O class companion. System The WR 22 system contains two massive stars which orbit every 80 days. The spectrum and luminosity are dominated by the primary, which has a spectral type of WN7h, indicating that it is a WR star on the nitrogen sequence, but also with hydrogen lines in its spectrum. The secondary is an O9 star which appears to have the spectral luminosity class of a giant star, but the brightness of a main sequence star. There is a shallow eclipse detectable when the primary passes in front of the secondary, which would be classed as the secondary eclipse. However, no primary eclipse is detected, which is believed to be due to the eccentricity of the system placing the stars further apart when the primary eclipse would occur. The separation of the stars varies from over to less than . This strongly constrains the possible inclinations of the system. Properties The masses of the two stars can be determined fairly accurately because WR 22 is an eclipsing binary. It is one of the most massive star systems measured in this way rather than by assumptions about stellar evolution. Despite this, the dynamical masses derived from orbital fitting vary from over to less than for the primary and about for the secondary. The spectroscopic mass of the primary has been calculated at or . The temperature of both stars is high, but somewhat poorly defined. The Wolf Rayet primary has a temperature of approximately 44,700 K derived from a model atmosphere fitting of the spectrum, and the secondary is assumed to have a temperature of 33,000 K which is typical for a star of its spectral type. The brightness of the two stars cannot be measured separately, but the luminosity ratio can be calculated. The total system absolute magnitude, for a distance of 2.7 kpc and extinction of 1.12 magnitudes, is −6.85. The luminosities calculated for a similar distance are and . Evolution High mass hydrogen- rich WR stars are young stars still burning hydrogen in their cores, rather than evolved stars fusing heavier elements. They show the WR characteristics of strong helium and nitrogen emission because they are strongly convective all the way to the core and have dredged up fusion products to the surface. About two million years ago, WR22 would have been an even hotter O type main sequence star with a mass of around . It will soon exhaust the hydrogen in its core and evolve into a classical hydrogen-poor WR star, possibly after a period as a luminous blue variable then explode as a supernova. The secondary star is expected to have a more traditional evolution into a red supergiant in a few million years time.

The group initially went by the name, The Royal Harmony Singers, as far back as 1936 and under that name reached #10 on the R&B; charts on November 14, 1942, with \\"Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition\\", a song adapted from the speech of a naval chaplain in response to the attack on Pearl Harbor the previous year. In 1946, the Jubalaires secured a spot on Arthur Godfrey's CBS radio show. Willie Johnson left the Golden Gate Quartet to take the lead of the group in 1948, and in 1950 the band appeared in the musical comedy film, Duchess of Idaho. Much of the Jubalaires' music was initially issued by Queen Records, a subsidiary of King Records specializing in African-American music; later reissues appeared on King Records proper. The band recorded with Andy Kirk on November 27, 1945, a session which produced the Decca Records 78rpm release, \\"I Know/Get Together With The Lord\\", and credited to Andy Kirk & His Orchestra With The Jubalaires. A third track recorded during the session, \\"Soothe Me\\", went unreleased. Other Jubalaires' releases included \\"Before This Time Another Year/Ezekiel (Saw The Wheel A Rollin')\\" (Decca), \\"God Almighty's Gonna Cut You Down/Go Down Moses\\" (King), and \\"My God Called Me This Morning/Ring That Golden Bell\\" (King).

Vacancy  The seat had become vacant when Shrewsbury's Conservative MP Sir Clement Hill died aged 67 on 9 April 1913, after a bout of influenza led to pneumonia and pleurisy. A diplomat for 40 years before entering politics, he had held the seat since the 1906 general election. Shrewsbury had elected only Conservative Party MPs to the House of Commons since 1885.  Candidates  The Unionist candidate was 59-year old George Butler Lloyd, a Marlborough and Cambridge-educated banker whose home was at Shelton Hall, near Shrewsbury. Butler Lloyd was an alderman of Shrewsbury Corporation and had been Mayor of Shrewsbury for 1886-87 and 1888-89. The local Liberal Party were keen to field as candidate Thomas Pace, a local builder, who had contested the seat in December 1910 as a Liberal- Labour candidate. Pace was a strong suffragist in support of votes for women, unlike the Unionist Butler Lloyd, who opposed extending the franchise. However, the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) had recently adopted a new policy of not supporting Liberal party candidates, even those Liberal candidates who were strong suffragists like Pace.The Standard, 22 April 1913 Liberal Party headquarters regarded a contest as inexpedient. Thus Pace withdrew from the contest. When nominations closed on 19 April, Butler Lloyd faced only one opponent, the independent candidate J. Robert Morris.  Campaign  =Votes for Women= The NUWSS, whose policy had contributed to the withdrawal of the Liberal candidate who supported them, chose not to support either the Unionist or the Independent. Without a candidate to support, the NUWSS were reduced to just carrying out propaganda work during the by-election. In the course of the contest Butler Lloyd had the assistance of his brother, Ernest Thomas Lloyd, Resident Magistrate in Ireland, formerly stationed in County Kerry, Meath, and County Londonderry, who spoke strongly during the election against proposed Irish Home Rule. On 21 April, the eve of poll, the former MP Horatio Bottomley spoke on behalf of Morris at a meeting of thousands of people in the town, where the principal speakers for Butler Lloyd were Henry Page Croft MP and William Bridgeman MP.  Result  Polling took place on 22 April, and Butler Lloyd held the seat with a slightly increased majority of 685 votes (16.6% of the total).  Aftermath  Butler Lloyd held the seat for nine years. The parliamentary borough of Shrewsbury was abolished at the 1918 general election, but was replaced by a larger county division of the same, where Butler Lloyd was re-elected. He retired from the House of Commons at the 1922 general election.

Early life Frank Couzens was born in Detroit on February 28, 1902, the son of businessman (and later mayor of Detroit and United States Senator) James J. Couzens. He went to Newman Preparatory School in New Jersey, then returned to Detroit to attend high school. After graduation, he worked as an apprentice in the building trades, then as an inspector for an architectural firm. In 1922, he formed his own building contractor firm. Frank Couzens married Margaret Lang in 1922; the couple had four sons: Frank Couzens Jr., James Couzens II, Homer J. Couzens, and George L. Couzens; and three daughters: Mrs. Edward C. Roney, Mary Elizabeth Couzens, and Barbara Ann Couzens. Politics In 1928, then-mayor John C. Lodge appointed Couzens a member of the Detroit Street Railways Commission. He was fired by the next mayor, Charles Bowles, in 1930 after opposing Bowles's effort to raise the streetcar fare. However, the deeply unpopular Bowles was recalled from office, and Frank Murphy reinstated Couzens. In 1931, Couzens ran for a seat on the Detroit City Council, and garnered enough votes to become council president. When Murphy resigned in 1933 to become governor of the Philippines, Couzens became acting mayor. He resigned the mayor's office on September 8, 1933, to concentrate on receiving the Republican nomination for the office. He was elected mayor twice, filling out four years in office. Later life After stepping down from the mayor's office, Couzens retired from politics and founded the Wabeek Bank of Detroit, whose chairman he remained for the next 12 years. He died after a long battle with cancer on October 31, 1950. Wabeek Bank would after a series of mergers become part of Comerica.

Life and career He was born in Bristol into a family of Methodists, and showed precocious talents, giving his first lecture at the age of 14. At the age of 16 he moved to London, and worked with his elder brother John Watts (1834-1866) in a printing office. Through this work the two brothers came into contact with freethinkers including Charles Southwell and Charles Bradlaugh. John Watts became an active proselytiser for secularism, and in 1863 was appointed editor of the National Reformer, a radical periodical founded by Bradlaugh, with Charles as assistant editor. In 1864 the brothers formed a publishing business, Watts & Co.Edward Royle, Victorian Infidels: The Origins of the British Secularist Movement 1791-1866 , Manchester University Press, 1974, Madalyn Murray O'Hair, Biography of Charles Watts, American Atheists John Watts died from tuberculosis at the age of 32. Charles Watts took charge of the publishing business and toured the country, delivering hundreds of lectures on theological, social, and political issues. He declared himself an atheist and, with Bradlaugh and others, helped found the National Secular Society (NSS) in 1866. In 1876, he was appointed full-time editor and publisher of the National Reformer. He also wrote and published a wide range of pamphlets on secularism and republicanism, and wrote the first systematic history of freethought, eventually published in book form as Freethought: its Rise, Progress and Triumph. His wife, Kate Eunice Watts, often travelled with him and also wrote pamphlets, including The Education and Position of Woman and Christianity: Defective and Unnecessary. In 1877 Charles Watts broke with Bradlaugh over the pamphlet The Fruits of Philosophy, which had been written by American physician and atheist Charles Knowlton, and which promoted birth control and discussed human sexuality. A publication about birth control. View original copy. The pamphlet was published for the first time in Britain by James Watson's publishing company in 1845. In 1876, Charles Watts published the pamphlet and was prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act. In protest of Watts' prosecution, Bradlaugh and Annie Besant, published the pamphlet it 1877 and were also prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act, resulting in the infamous \\"Knowlton Trial\\" of Bradlaugh and Besant. Later Watts was released, resigned from the NSS, and, with George Holyoake and George Foote, formed the British Secular Union, a short-lived rival group. Watts became editor of the Secular Review founded by Holyoake. G. H. Taylor, A Chronology of British Secularism, National Secular Society, 1957 In 1882, he travelled for the first time to the United States to lecture, and also visited Canada, where he was invited to take up residence. He emigrated to Toronto in 1883, leaving his son Charles Albert Watts in charge of his publishing interests in Britain. Charles Watts then became the leader of the secularist movement in Canada, founding and editing Secular Thought in Toronto, and also regularly went on lecture tours of the US. He returned in 1891 to England, where his son had by then established the periodical Watts's Literary Guide (the forerunner of the New Humanist magazine) to promote secularist activities. Charles Watts rejoined the NSS and continued lecturing, as well as cooperating with Foote on the journal, The Freethinker. He returned to the US and Canada, with Foote, to lecture in 1896, and again visited the US in 1899. He died in England in 1906 at the age of 70.

The official name of the church is '. The name of the parish became St. Martin Idsteiner Land on 1 January 2017, when it was merged with five other parishes. The parish is part of the Diocese of Limburg. St. Martin is the patron saint of Idstein, to whom a Gothic church was dedicated in 1330. The present building, designed by architect Johannes Krahn, was consecrated in 1965. It replaced a church built in 1888 in Gothic Revival style and dedicated to Mary Magdalene. The earlier church was too small for the congregation growing after World War II. After restoration in 2003, a new organ was installed in 2006. Church music in services and concerts, performed by several groups including a children's choir and ensembles playing historic instruments, have received attention in the Rhein-Main Region. The parish is in long-term ecumenical contact with the main Protestant church of the town, the , which includes two regular ecumenical services and concerts performed by joint groups of both churches.  History of the parish St. Martin  The beginning of Christianity in Idstein is not documented. When the Idstein Castle was first mentioned in 1102, the area belonged to the Diocese of Trier. Idstein possibly had a church in Romanesque style, which was replaced in 1330 by a Gothic church dedicated to St. Martin, the patron saint of Idstein. It was the church of a founded in 1333 for six canons, and became the Protestant church with the Reformation, named in 1917. During the Reformation, Idstein became Lutheran beginning in 1540 under . The last Catholic canon left the town in 1553, which then had no Catholic congregation until the beginning of the 19th century. In 1806, Frederick Augustus, Duke of Nassau allowed the practice of the Catholic cult again. Thirteen families were permitted to use the chapel of the Schloss. The dukedom became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1866. In 1884, the minister Wilhelm Schilo began the building of a church for a growing congregation, collecting money all over Germany. The architect Aloys Vogt, from the local (School for building trades), designed a hall church with two aisles in Gothic Revival style, built from 1887 to 1888. The building, seating 135 people, was dedicated to Mary Magdalene () by Bishop on 8 October 1888. The Catholic population of Idstein grew considerably after World War II, when many refugees and displaced persons moved to Idstein. Minister Hans Usinger first built a (community center) and pursued from 1961 the building of a larger church. The was dynamited in 1963. The building of the new church began in 1963. It was consecrated, again to St. Martin, on 5 June 1965 by Bishop Wilhelm Kempf. On 1 January 2017, the parish became part of the larger St. Martin Idsteiner Land parish, which includes five other former parishes: Maria Königin Niedernhausen, St. Nikolaus von Flüe Idstein- Wörsdorf/Hünstetten, St. Martha Niedernhausen-Engenhahn, St. Michael Niedernhausen-Oberjosbach and St. Thomas Waldems. A service was held on 5 February by Wolfgang Rösch.  Construction of the present church  St. Martin, Idstein Station of the Cross Professor Johannes Krahn, who built several churches and early skyscrapers such as the Beehive House in Frankfurt am Main, designed a space recalling elements of an early Romanesque Basilica. In a simple shape, a single long nave is concluded by a semicircle choir around the altar. On the right side the wall opens to a side chapel, reminiscent of a transept. The outer walls are sandstone, visible both inside and outside. Light flows in from a band of windows under the plain wooden ceiling. The combination of materials has been compared to Le Corbusier. The building recalls the austere style of sacred architecture of the 1950s. The floor is of Jura marble, the altar, ambo, baptismal font and tabernacle are made of Lahn marble. The wall behind the altar held a neo-Gothic crucifixion scene of Mary, John, and Mary Magdalene under the cross, from the Magdalenenkirche. Low stained glass windows forming the Stations of the Cross were designed by Paul Corazolla from Berlin. The first organ was built by E. F. Walcker & Cie. and consecrated in 1974. It was placed on the right side in the opening for the chapel, visible to the congregation. The free-standing bell tower, housing four bells, is 42 m high.  Restoration in 2003  The walls of the church were completely restored in 2003. At the same time the altar was moved closer to the congregation, making more room for the choir. The baptismal font was relocated from the chapel to the front, opposite the ambo. The tabernacle, which had been where the baptismal font is now, and the crucifixion scene were moved to the chapel, creating a chapel for adoration. The restoration works were directed by Franz Josef Hamm from Limburg. The new cross above the altar was created by a group of young people in preparation for confirmation. During the restoration the organ had to be taken apart. The parish decided not to restore it but to have a new organ built.  Mebold organ and concerts  Mebold organ The organ was built by Orgelbau Mebold and consecrated on 22 January 2006. The instrument has 1,888 pipes and 33 stops on two manuals and a pedalboard. The layout of its great division () reflects the classic organ construction of the Baroque period, whilst the swell division (or swell box) () has the timbre of the Romantic, which makes it possible to play a wide range of the organ repertoire from different eras. The first organ concert on the Mebold organ was played by Dan Zerfaß, organist of the Worms Cathedral. The organ is used mostly in services, but has been played in concerts of artists such as Kalevi Kiviniemi. In 2005 Graham Waterhouse was the soloist in the premiere of his Cello Concerto in the chamber version on 5 August 2005. Giora Feidman and Matthias Eisenberg performed a duo programme on 14 November 2008. Christian Schmitt played in 2007 with the chamber choir of the Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst Frankfurt, conducted by Wolfgang Schäfer, who returned in 2010 to conduct the Frankfurter Kammerchor.  Church music  Franz Fink has been the cantor of St. Martin since 1992, conducting five musical groups, a children's choir , the , the Martinis (a chamber choir of mostly young people), the , and the on period instruments.

Education Mihir Shah graduated with a B.A. degree in Economics in 1976 from St. Stephen's College, Delhi. In 1978, he received an M.A. degree in Economics from Delhi School of Economics. He also received a PhD degree in Economics from Centre for Development Studies (affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru University), Trivandrum in 1984. Career From 2009 to 2014, Shah was Member, Planning Commission, Government of India, holding the portfolios of Water Resources, Rural Development and Decentralised Governance. He is the youngest ever Member of the Planning Commission. Shah was chiefly responsible for drafting the paradigm shift in the management of water resources enunciated in the 12th Five Year Plan. As Chairman of the Government of India's Committee for Revision of MGNREGA Guidelines, he initiated a makeover of MGNREGA, the largest employment programme in human history, with a renewed emphasis on rural livelihoods based on construction of productive assets. An expert on water and rural development, he holds memberships in several important committees such as the International Steering Committee of the CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE) and serves as the chair of the Revitalising Rainfed Areas Network in India. He is also the first President of the Bharat Rural Livelihoods Foundation, which supports innovative civil society action in close partnership with state governments. He also chaired the Government of India's Task Force on the National Social Assistance Programme which presented a landmark report in 2013. Mihir Shah chaired the Advisory Council of the first India Rural Development Report brought out by the Ministry of Rural Development. In 1990, he co-founded Samaj Pragati Sahayog, which is today one of the largest grass-roots initiatives for water and livelihood security, working with its partners on a million acres of land across 72 of India’s most backward districts. Mihir Shah has spent nearly three decades living and working in central tribal India, forging a new paradigm of inclusive and sustainable development. Mihir Shah, along with his colleagues penned their experiences in the book, India's Drylands: Tribal Societies and Development through Environmental Regeneration, which was published by Oxford University Press in 1998. The book brings out the macro- economic significance of watershed programmes for food security and employment guarantee in India. He has also played a significant role shaping policies and in the development of tribal areas in Madhya Pradesh. He coauthored one of three chapters in Human Development Report of the state in 1998. Shah is a visiting faculty member at Ashoka University, where he teaches a course on the Political Economy of India's Development 1947-2014 for the Young India Fellowship students. With effect from 1 August 2016, Shah has been appointed the first Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Shiv Nadar University. Under Shah's leadership, the Shiv Nadar University launched an M.Sc. Program on Water Science and Policy in August 2017, which aims to be a first-of-its-kind program globally. Few programs across the world are able to incorporate the essential multi-disciplinary character of water. Fewer still deal with the urgent policy requirements of the sector. This program, with a faculty drawn from leading water experts from across the world, seeks to address both lacunae. The main aim of the program is to create a critical mass of water professionals with a historically and socially contextualised, multi- disciplinary perspective and understanding of water. These water professionals would guide development of sustainable and just 21st century policies, programmes and solutions to the growing water crisis. In September 2015, Shah led a seven-member committee to restructure the Central Water Commission (CWC) and the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), and achieve optimal development of water resources in the country The panel recommended disbanding the CWC and CGWB, two of the biggest water organisations, and creating a multi- disciplinary National Water Commission (NWC) in their place, and for greater involvement of social scientists, professionals from management and other specialised disciplines and reduce reliance on engineers who man the CWC. Full report of the committee is available in the Ministry of Water resources website. The highly rated social science journal, Economic and Political Weekly, devoted a whole issue (December 24, 2016) to a symposium on the Mihir Shah Committee Report with 12 renowned water scholars and activists commenting on it and Mihir Shah giving a response (http://www.epw.in/journal/2016/52). However, the CWC is unhappy with these recommendations and sent a strong note condemning them to the Water Resources Minister, Uma Bharati.http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/cwc-staff- slam-mihir-shah-panel-report-on-water-reforms-2996427/ The CWC claimed that these recommendations were anti-dam and anti-development, both of which Shah refuted claiming that on the contrary they intent to make them much stronger institutions in a new avatar which would devolve more power to states and reduce delays in techno-economic appraisals of projects. Mihir Shah notes, \\"it is not enough to just build dams and then forget about the trillions of litres of water stored in them. We need to ensure that this water reaches the people\\".http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/mihir-shah-panel-water- management-cwc-3001152/ The prime minister's office is evidently open to the idea of forming a National Water Commission, combining CWC and CGWB http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pmo-open-to-national-water- commission/article9022684.ece In July 2017, Shah became one of the Founding Signatories of the Geneva Actions on Water Security, which aim to secure environmentally sustainable water services for those people who are least able to afford them and ensure, as a first priority, that investments from the Global Human Water Security Fund meet the basic water needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable people for drinking, hygiene, and cooking. In December 2017, Shah was appointed Chair of the Task Group to draft the Karnataka State Water Policy. The Group submitted its report in December 2018. In August 2019, the Government of Madhya Pradesh asked Shah to chair a Group of Water Experts tasked with devising a new water strategy for MP (click on image below). In November 2019, the Government of India set up a Committee to draft the National Water Policy. Dr. Mihir Shah was asked to chair this Committee. This is the first time since the National Water Policy was first drafted in 1987 that a person from the outside government has been asked to chair this committee (click on image below).

He began his career in local-league football with his hometown club, Gainford, before joining Football League side Darlington in 1927. He later played for Nelson and Barrow, before returning to non-league football. Biography Thomas Owen Carmedy was born to a Roman Catholic family in Gainford, County Durham on 23 June 1904. Following his retirement from football, he lived in the south of England was employed in a tailor's shop. Carmedy died in Weybridge, Surrey, in January 1985 at the age of 80. Playing career =Early career= Carmedy started his footballing career with his local club, Gainford. In March 1927, he signed for Football League Second Division side Darlington as an amateur player. Following the team's relegation to the Third Division North at the end of the 1926–27 campaign, Carmedy made his debut for Darlington on 31 August 1927 in the 1–0 win against Bradford City. However, he did not make another appearance for the club, and in November 1927, he returned to non-league football with Cockfield. Shortly afterwards, he moved to Bishop Auckland, where he remained until midway through the 1928–29 season. =Nelson= Carmedy was signed by Third Division North outfit Nelson in December 1928, initially on amateur terms. The following month, he was awarded a professional contract and made his debut for the club on 19 January 1929, scoring in the 1–1 draw with Southport at Seedhill. He then spent several matches out of the side, before making a return to play three matches as an outside forward in place of the unavailable Harry Ridley.Dykes, pp. 82–84 In April 1929, he scored in consecutive matches against Halifax Town and Lincoln City, meaning that he ended the season with a total of three goals in eight appearances for his new club. In the 1929–30 campaign, Carmedy became more of a first-team player at Nelson, especially after new signing Fred Ferrari fell out of favour with the directors despite scoring three goals in his opening seven matches for the club. On his fourth appearance of the season, Carmedy netted a hat- trick in the 4–0 home win over Wrexham. He enjoyed a sustained run at centre forward between December 1929 and February 1930, during which time he scored a further four goals. Towards the end of the season, he shared centre forward duties with new arrival Ernie Dixon, who had arrived from Huddersfield Town for a fee of £300. Carmedy ended the campaign with 10 goals in 29 league matches as the team finished 19th in the league. The following season was a disappointing one for Nelson, as they finished bottom of the Third Division North and failed in their bid for re-election in the summer of 1931. In one the side's few victories, Carmedy scored the second hat-trick of his professional career in the 4–2 win against Accrington Stanley. The majority of Carmedy's appearances during the 1930–31 campaign were made at outside-right, and subsequently he scored fewer goals than he had in the previous season, scoring a total of 7 in 29 games. In March 1931, he was forced to play as a goalkeeper during a reserve match against Lancaster Town. In snowy conditions, he conceded four goals, although a match report in a local newspaper claimed that his performance was \\"nothing short of remarkable\\". =Return to non- league= Most of the Nelson players departed the club following their relegation to the Lancashire Combination in 1931. Carmedy stayed in the Third Division North, signing a deal with Barrow. During a solitary season at Holker Street, he made seven first-team appearances but failed to get on the scoresheet for the club. In October 1932, he returned to non-league football, joining Boston Town on a free transfer. He spent a year with the side, before moving to Northwood United, where he ended his career, in November 1933.

After the nation's defeat in the Second Balkan War and World War I, in 1924 the company and all of its equipment were relocated in Kazanlak, a town situated in central Bulgaria. The armory was given the name (\\"State Military Factory\\"). Initially producing only artillery gun components and ammunition, the factory later began to manufacture gas masks (1920s), nitroglycerin (1930s), machine tools (1940s) and finally assault rifles, optic sights and B-10 recoilless rifles (1950s). The first assault rifle, a direct copy of the Soviet AK-47, was produced in 1958. By the 1960s a total of seven factories were under the company's jurisdiction. Until the Fall of Communism in 1989-1990, the company was named Mashinostroitelen kombinat Fridrikh Engels (\\"Friedrich Engels Machinery Works\\") to conceal its activities as a military enterprise. As part of this strategy it adopted the manufacture of various civilian products, including automobiles such as the then-popular Bulgarrenault-8. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Arsenal began cooperation with companies from Japan, Sweden, Ukraine and Germany. Currently Arsenal AD is a private company conducting international arms trade, although it also expands its civilian exports, now including high-precision metalworking machinery, mobile robot manipulators and synthetic diamonds.

The -F model features a folding stock.

Chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO and 7.62×39mm. * AR-M7F - improved AK-47 copy like the AR-M1, but with an AK-101-style folding stock. * AR-M9 / AR-M9F - improved AK-47 copy like the AR-M1/AR-M1F, features a thumb- operable fire selector and a different style polymer stock set. AR-M9F uses a NATO length right side folding tubular stock. Unlike most AK folding variants that have left side folding stocks. The advantages a right side folder has over a left allows the optic mount to remain on the weapon when folded. Instead of having to remove the optic mount to latch the stock. The AR-M9F can still be fired from a folded position as the reciprocating charging handle clears the stock. The selector lever can also still be used since the left side incorporates the thumb selector lever on left side of grip. AR-M9F civilian base rifle counterpart in semiautomatic is the SAM7SF-84. * AR-1 / AR-1F - improved AK-47 copies with black polymer lining and luminous sights. * AR-SF - based on AKS-74U with laser aim indicator.

The type species is Blasisaurus canudoi, described in 2010 by Penélope Cruzado-Caballero, Xabier Pereda-Suberbiola and José Ignacio Ruiz-Omeñaca, a group of researchers from Spain. Naming and discovery The generic name refers to the Blasi 1 site where the fossil was found. The specific epithet honours paleontologist José Ignacio Canudo. The holotype, MPZ99/667, is housed in Huesca. It was found in a layer of the Arén Formation dating from the upper Maastrichtian, about 66 million years old. It consists of a skull with fragmentary lower jaws. Description Blasisaurus is a medium-sized euornithopod. The describers have been able to identify two distinct features: the cheekbone has a rear projection with a hook-shaped upper edge, and the lower sleep window is narrow and D-shaped. From the same formation is Arenysaurus, a related species. They are not identical, distinguished by the shape of the teeth and missing secondary ridges. Blasisaurus also differs from Koutalisaurus by a downwardly bent front edge of the lower jaws. Phylogeny The describers performed an exact cladistic analysis to determine its phylogenetic position. The outcome of the phylogenetic analysis placed Blasisaurus as the sister taxon to Arenysaurus. Together they form a clade that is higher in Lambeosaurinae than Tsintaosaurus and Jaxartosaurus. Whether this clade was more derived than Amurosaurus, the closest relative of the group, was not determined. However, one study did find that they were not sister taxa, no other studies supported this. Blasisaurus confirmed the hypothesis that in the Late Cretaceous, different Hadrosaurids from Asia and Europe was a sign that they migrated across land bridges that must have been present. Where in lambeosaurinae Blasisaurus and Arenysaurus fall is disputed. They have been found to be in lambeosaurini, as basal to the Lambeosaurini-Parasaurolophini split, and in Parasaurolophini.

Filming took place in New York City on top of The Roosevelt Hotel. It was met with mostly negative reception by critics, and grossed $8 million (USA) in its opening weekend. The film's soundtrack, written by Henry Jackman, was released alongside the film, also to negative reception from critics. Plot In New York City, Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) checks into the Roosevelt Hotel under the false name of Walker, goes to his hotel room on the 21st floor, and climbs on the ledge, ready to commit suicide. The crowd below calls the police, with Dante Marcus (Titus Welliver) controlling the crowd, while Jack Dougherty (Edward Burns) tries to talk with Nick. However, Nick will only speak to negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), who is on a leave of absence, after failing to save a suicidal policeman on the Brooklyn Bridge. Lydia arrives at the hotel room and manages to acquire Nick's fingerprints from a cigarette they share, after his initial resistance to revealing his true identity, going as far as to wipe any surface he touched in the main room to remove fingerprints. Dougherty has them analyzed and discovers that Nick is an ex-policeman, arrested for stealing the $40 million Monarch diamond from businessman David Englander (Ed Harris). Nick was given a 25-year sentence but escaped from the Sing Sing Correctional Facility one month before the main events of the film, after being allowed to attend his father's funeral. Nick, however, maintains his innocence and accuses Englander of framing him for the theft of the diamond, as Englander lost his fortune and was too proud to sell the diamond. Unknown to the police, Nick is merely distracting them while his brother, Joey (Jamie Bell), and Joey's girlfriend, Angie (Genesis Rodriguez), break into Englander's vault across the street, using the cover of Nick's theatrics to detonate explosives on the roof to gain entry, in order to steal the diamond and ultimately prove Nick's innocence. Cassidy must make use of double entendres in order to provide instructions to Joey and Angie through an earpiece whilst not revealing their plan to the police. Meanwhile, Dougherty informs Marcus of Nick's identity, and Marcus orders the jewelry store's security to check the vault. Joey and Angie are able to evade them by hiding in a ceiling vent, but do not find the diamond. They deliberately set off the heat-sensing alarms, tricking Englander into retrieving the diamond and ambush him in his office, stealing the diamond at gunpoint and forcing him to handcuff himself to his safe. Meanwhile, Nick's ex-partner, Mike Ackerman (Anthony Mackie), arrives at the hotel with evidence that Nick is planning something and demands to be allowed into the hotel room. Lydia does not trust him, and Dougherty backs her up. Ackerman claims he has found bomb schematics in a storage unit Nick rented and is convinced that he will detonate an explosive somewhere. While the crowd is evacuated by the bomb squad, Lydia, believing in Nick's innocence, calls Internal Affairs and discovers that three of the cops employed by Englander were suspected of being corrupt: Ackerman, Marcus, and a deceased officer called Walker, whose name Cassidy uses when checking into the hotel. Joey and Angie enter the hotel and hand the bag containing the diamond to the hotel concierge (William Sadler). The concierge pockets the diamond while placing the bag onto the rack. Englander calls Marcus, one of the corrupt cops who helped him frame Nick, and has him capture Joey and Angie as they reach the street. Nick begins to make his escape through the hotel, with a tactical team in hot pursuit, at one point being aided by the concierge who tells him \\"everyone is rooting for you, kid,\\" while handing him a disguise, with the diamond hidden in one of the pockets. Marcus chases Nick to the roof, where he has Lydia arrested for obstruction, removing her from the rooftop to allow him to deal with Nick alone. Englander brings Joey and Angie, threatening to throw Joey off the roof if Nick does not give him the diamond. Nick turns it over, under protests from Joey, and Englander leaves. Meanwhile, Lydia escapes custody whilst in an elevator and rushes back to the roof. Marcus attempts to force Nick to jump off the roof, but Ackerman arrives and shoots Marcus, who wounds Ackerman. Nick rushes to Ackerman's side, who apologizes and reveals that he had no idea that Englander would frame Nick for stealing the diamond. Marcus survives, as he is wearing a bulletproof vest, and is preparing to kill Nick, when Lydia shoots him, but does not kill him. Seeing Englander leaving the area, mocking him with a wave, Nick jumps from the roof onto an airbag set up earlier by the police, catches up to Englander, beats him with the assistance of a crowd member, and pulls the diamond he had only just recently given him from his jacket, proving Nick's innocence in front of both the police and public, resulting in Englander being arrested. Later, Nick is cleared of all charges and released from custody and meets Joey, Angie, and Lydia at a bar owned by Nick's father, where it is revealed that the bartender, also the hotel concierge, is in fact Nick and Joey's father, Frank Cassidy, who had faked his own death in order to allow Nick to break out of prison under the guise of attending his father's funeral, and prove his innocence. Lydia at this point in the film asks Nick to \\"explain everything\\" to her before Joey proposes to Angie with a diamond ring presumably stolen from Englander's vault. She accepts and they all celebrate together. Cast * Sam Worthington as Nick Cassidy / Joe Walker\\"Elizabeth Banks and Sam Worthington to Star in Man on a Ledge\\". BuzzSugar.com.

The film was distributed by Summit Entertainment and E1 Entertainment (UK). During development a large, on-rails prop was used to make the Roosevelt hotel seem taller, so that the hotel would remain consistent with the shots filmed in- studio instead of on the hotel itself. During the scenes where Nick is running along the sides of the hotel, extra floors were added during post-production in order to save the need for a second attachment. In post-production crowds were edited in from other shots so that the crowds would appear consistent throughout the film. The lead actor, Sam Worthington, admitted during interviews that he had a fear of heights that he had to tackle during recording of the film. Release =Critical response= The film received mostly negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 32% approval rating based on 159 reviews, with average score of 4.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Uninspired acting and preposterous plotlines defuse Man on a Ledges mildly intriguing premise.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said \\"The movie cuts back and forth between two preposterous plot lines and uses the man on the ledge as a device to pump up the tension.\\" According to Ebert, too much depends on Nick securing a leave from prison, escaping from two armed guards, reaching Manhattan, checking into the correct hotel room on the correct floor and not falling off prematurely. Anna Smith felt that the film \\"embrace[d] its own lunacy readily enough\\", but criticised the \\"ridiculous ending\\". Similarly, The New Zealand Herald considered the film \\"a missed opportunity\\" that doesn't live up to its potential\\", pointing at the \\"limited\\" location Sam Worthington had to work with, praising how he still appeared \\"suitably terrified\\". The film placed fifth in the box office top ten with a low $8,300,000 gross on its opening weekend. Overall, the film grossed $46,221,189 from its $42 million budget. =DVD and Blu-ray= The DVD and Blu-ray Disc was released in the United States on May 29, 2012, with a rating of PG-13. The disc contains a 20-minute featurette which shows behind-the-scenes footage, with an explanation of how various shots or effects were achieved. For instance, producer Lorenzo explains how shots of the crowd were composited onto a green chroma keying carpet, laid down underneath the fake ledge used for shots recorded in-studio. For those who are visually impaired, a version of the film is included where a voiceover explains everything that is happening so that people with these visual ailments are still able to enjoy the film. The Steelbook version of the film completely lacks any menus to speak of, and as a result is missing the special features present in the DVD and Blu-ray releases. The 4K UHD Blu-ray was released in April 2019. Music The soundtrack to Man on a Ledge was released on January 27, 2012. =Critical reception= The soundtrack was met with negative reception. James Southall commented that whilst \\"there is occasionally some reasonably tense action music\\", he found most of the score \\"very tired-sounding\\". However, Jørn Tillnes described it as \\"succeed[ing] in almost every way\\", but that he \\"would prefer more variation\\", as he found that \\"as a complete listening experience, you get bored with it\\"..

Biography Peter Tammer began working in the film industry when he was 19 years old, in 1962. He worked as a film editor for film companies such as Eltham Films, with Tim Burstall, and later for government organisations such as the Commonwealth Film Unit. He started creating his own independent short films in 1964, such as And He Shall Rise Again (1964, 15 mins) and Beethoven and all that Jazz (1964, 2 mins). Through the 1960s, he connected with other Melbourne independent filmmakers such as Nigel Buesst and Tom Cowan, and Paul Cox.Cox, Paul, Reflections: An Autobiographical Journey, Currency Press, 1998 In the early 1970s, Tammer was a founding member of the Melbourne Film-maker's Co-op, an important group for independent filmmakers in Melbourne at the time.Hodsdon, J. Barrett, Straight roads and crossed lines: the quest for film culture in Australia from the 1960s? [editor: Peter Mudie, 2001] Prior to the formation of the Melbourne Co-op, together with his wife Monique, Tammer put together a very early programme of independent short films called \\"A Breath of Fresh Air\\". He was associated with other filmmakers such as Jim Wilson, Fred Harden, Bert Deling, James Clayden, many of whom were now showing films at the Piencotheca Gallery, a precursor to the Melbourne Film Co-op. He also had a productive association with Garry Patterson in the mid 1970s, for the films Here's To You, Mr. Robinson (1976, 52 mins) and How Willingly You Sing (1977, 90 mins, directed by Patterson, with cinematography by Tammer). Tammer's teaching career began in 1973, when he was appointed a Tutor in a film course at Melbourne State College in Carlton. In 1979, he was appointed Lecturer in Film at the Swinburne Film and Television School (founded in 1966). In 1986, Tammer was appointed Senior Lecturer in Film, and in 1992 the Film and Television School transferred to the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA). At the VCA Tammer moved in 1966 from teaching the Graduate Diploma of Film and Television (Narrative) to deliver the newly created Graduate Diploma of Film and Television Documentary stream. Tammer was an inspirational teacher for many of the students,See former student Daryl Dellora's reflections in this VCA newsletter . and he retired from the VCA in 1998.For more on the Film and Television School, including references to Tammer's teaching, see the book Paterson, Barbara, Renegades: Australia's first film school: from Swinburne to VCA, Helicon Press, 1996 Tammer continued making his own independent films all through this time, producing a series of award-winning films in the 1980s, including Mallacoota Stampede (1981, 60 mins), Journey to the End of Night (1982, 70 mins), and Hey Marcel ... (1984, 17 mins). A cherished project on the film scholar and actor John Flaus, entitled Flausfilm, was begun in 1988 and finally completed in 2009.

It was developed by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE), with partners the Home Builders Federation, the Civic Trust and Design for Homes. The Building for Life tool comprises 20 questions, or criteria,CABE, Building for Life: The 20 criteria, 4 November 2008. to assess the design quality of new housing developments, resulting in a numerical score. The criteria reflect the importance of functionality, attractiveness and sustainability in well-designed homes and neighbourhoods. The approach embodied by the criteria is based on national planning policy guidanceCommunities and Local Government, Planning Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development, 31 January 2005.Communities and Local Government, Planning Policy Statement 3: Housing, 9 June 2010.Communities and Local Government, Planning Policy Statement 17: Planning for Open space, Sport and Recreation, 24 July 2002 and on urban design principles.CABE, By Design: urban design in the planning system towards better practice, April 2000.Department for Transport, Manual for Streets, 2007, Thomas Telford Ltd, . The criteria also link to other standards for housing design, including the BREEAM EcoHomes standard, the Code for Sustainable Homes,Communities and Local Government, The code for sustainable homes: setting the standard in sustainability for new homes , 27 February 2008 Lifetime HomesLifetime Homes, Lifetime Homes, 16 Design Criteria from 5 July 2010 (REVISED) and Secured by Design.Secured by Design, Secured by Design, New Homes 2010 Uses Uses for Building for Life include the following: *The basis of development briefs written by developers and housing associations *A tool to assess compliance with quality standards, for projects being considered for public sector funding, or being built on publicly owned land *An assessment method included by local authorities developing local planning frameworks, core strategies and supplementary planning guidance *A framework for Design Teams to structure Design and Access statements supporting their planning applications *Assessments by local authorities during pre-planning discussions and in reviewing planning applications *An auditing and monitoring tool, to allow local and national government to audit the quality of completed projects *An award scheme aimed at showcasing and celebrating better quality housing projects after completion *A best practice resource, through the website and case study library. History In 2001 the director of the Civic Trust, Mike Gwilliam, approached the Home Builders Federation with an idea to showcase the best new housing. They shared with CABE the aim of promoting high quality design and CABE's chief executive Jon Rouse supported the initiative. The three organisations entered into a formal partnership and invited architect and urban designer Sir Terry Farrell to chair a panel of experts to take the initiative forward. This panel included Martin Bacon, David Birkbeck, Keith Bradley, Steve Lidgate, Kelvin Macdonald, Dr John Miles, Dickon Robinson, Jon Rouse, Julian Smith, Peter Studdert and David Taylor. The Building for Life campaign was launched on 11 September 2001 with a manifesto, aiming to promote design excellence and showcase best practice in the house building industry; understand the needs and aspirations of home buyers; and identify barriers to good design whilst campaigning to remove them. At a meeting on 13 December 2001, Design for Homes became an advisor to the partnership in recognition for the considerable time and effort they had contributed to the initiative. Subsequently, Design for Homes produced a website on behalf of the partnership, www.buildingforlife.org, showcasing 10 very different schemes showing how housebuilding could excel in many different ways, provided it had adequate urban design manners and reasonable public and private amenity. Key principles of good urban design had been documented in a variety of ways including in By design: urban design in the planning system towards better practice (2000).: Objectives of Urban Design *Character A place with its own identity *Continuity and enclosure A place where public and private spaces are clearly distinguished *Quality of the public realm A place with successful outdoor areas *Ease of movement A place that is easy to get to and move through *Legibility A place that has a clear image and is easy to understand *Adaptability A place that can change easily *Diversity A place with variety and choice Aspects of Development Form *Layout: urban structure The framework of routes and spaces that connect locally and more widely, and the way developments, routes and open spaces relate to one another *Layout: urban grain The pattern of the arrangement of street blocks, plots and their buildings in a settlement *Landscape The character and appearance of land, including its shape, form, ecology, natural features, colours and elements, and the way these components combine *Density and mix The amount of development on a given piece of land and the range of uses. Density influences the intensity of development, and in combination with the mix of uses can affect a place’s vitality and viability. *Scale: height Scale is the size of a building in relation to its surroundings, or the size of parts of a building or its details, particularly in relation to the size of a person. Height determines the impact of development on views, vistas and skylines. *Scale: massing The combined effect of the arrangement, volume and shape of a building or group of buildings in relation to other buildings and spaces *Appearance: details The craftsmanship, building techniques, decoration, styles and lighting of a building or structure. *Appearance: materials The texture, colour, pattern and durability of materials, and how they are used. In 2002 the criteria used for the case studies were: *Continuity and enclosure *Legibility *Character *Ease of movement and layout *Connections *Travel choices *Streets and spaces *Density and mix *Maintenance *Safety *Disabled access *Parking *Community facilities The case study selection criteria needed to codify what was being celebrated. There was a need to clearly state on what basis the case studies were chosen. A set of questions were produced turning principles from several publications into shorthand, notably English Partnerships' \\"Urban Design Compendium\\", By design: urban design in the planning system towards better practice., and Urbed's \\"Building the 21st Century Home\\". The author of these was Design for Homes' David Birkbeck who worked with CABE's Dr Edward Hobson and proposed them to Home Builders Federation's Mark Rice. These 20 questions were eventually published as the Building for Life criteria in July 2003, following input from the Civic Trust's Liz Wrigley and CABE's Alex Ely. In 2003, ten housing developments were celebrated with the Building for Life awards, on the basis of their good performance against the Building for Life criteria, and Wayne Hemingway replaced Sir Terry Farrell as chairman of the panel. Over the period 2004 to 2007, Building for Life was used as the basis for the first national audit of housing design quality, which highlighted the inadequate quality of much of England's newly built housing.CABE, Housing audit 2004: London, the South East and the East of England, 30 September 2004.CABE, Housing audit 2005: North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber, 1 November 2005.CABE, Housing audit 2006: East Midlands, West Midlands and the South West, 8 February 2007. While Building for Life was initially applied to completed housing developments, in 2003 CABE also developed and encouraged its use as means of achieving good design during the planning process. English Partnerships adopted Building for Life for use as a standard in September 2005, requiring proposals for development on land they owned to achieve 14 out of the 20 criteria at tender disposal stage. They also required schemes to be submitted to the Building for Life awards when they were 50% complete.English Partnerships Places Homes People, Policy Guidance, English Partnership’s Quality Standards - delivering quality places , revised from November 2007. In April 2007, the Housing Corporation published its design and quality standards,Housing Corporation, Design and Quality Standards, April 2007. which incorporated Building for Life as the assessment method for the external environment. All new homes which received grant funding through the National Affordable Housing Programme were required to achieve 12 out of the 20 criteria. The Housing Corporation also carried out an audit of the quality of affordable homes built prior to the adoption of the new standards.Housing Corporation, Affordable Housing Survey: A review of the quality of affordable housing in England , 2008. The Housing Corporation also published guidance from HATC Ltd on how to achieve the requirements of Building for Life, aimed at housing association Development staff i.e. project managers rather than designers.Housing Corporation, Achieving Building for Life In 2008, the Department for Communities and Local Government commissioned CABE to check on progress and provide an independent view of quality in the Thames Gateway. CABE carried out a quality audit using Building for Life. The government's aspiration was that in 2010, no scheme in the Thames Gateway should achieve fewer than 10 criteria out of 20, and at least 50% of schemes should achieve more than 14 out of the 20 criteria. By 2015, 100% of schemes in the Thames Gateway should achieve a score of 14 out of the 20 criteria. In 2008, the government requested that local authorities use Building for Life to measure progress in improving design quality. In July of that year, Building for Life criteria were incorporated into the revised list of core output indicators published by the Department for Communities and Local Government, upon which local authorities were required to report.Communities and Local Government, Regional Spatial Strategy and Local Development Framework Core Output Indicators – Update 2/2008 To support the application of Building for Life by local authorities and others, the Department for Communities and Local Government commissioned CABE to deliver a programme to create a national network of accredited assessors across local authorities in England. CABE developed a training and accreditation programme and drafted a Code of Conduct which Accredited Assessors were required to sign up to. By the end of 2010, CABE had trained 497 local authority professionals and had accredited 301 assessors in 194 local authorities to carry out formal assessments. In 2010, Homes and Communities Agency set out in their proposed core housing design and sustainability standards consultation plans to make achieving 14/20 of the Building for Life criteria mandatory.Homes and Communities Agency Homes and Communities Agency Proposed Core Housing Design and Sustainability Standards Consultation , March 2010 The Homes and Communities Agency commissioned CABE to carry out Building for Life assessments of applications to the Kickstart Housing Delivery programmeHomes and Communities Agency, Kickstart Housing Delivery: Unlocking stalled sites , May 2009. They funded one-day assessments of each application, on the basis of evidence submitted to the Kickstart programme; assessments were carried out by a group of around 40 built environment professionals, trained and supervised by CABE. A number of local authorities adopted Building for Life. For example, in 2008 North West Leicestershire District Council used Building for Life as a design quality indicator for all new residential led developments of ten homes or more, requiring that 14 criteria must be met to meet the council's expectations. By the end of 2010, a number of local authorities had integrated Building for Life into their policy framework in different ways. These included North Northamptonshire, Sheffield City Council, Ashford Borough Council, Southampton City Council, South Gloucestershire Council, East Dorset District Council, Mansfield District Council, North Lincolnshire District Council, Erewash Borough Council, North Kesteven District Council, Rushcliffe Borough Council, London Borough of Merton, Fylde Borough Council, Nottingham City Council and London Borough of Havering. The Building for Life standard Building for Life standards are given to all entries to the Building for Life awards that score more than 14/20. Schemes that score 14/20 or 15/20 receive the silver standard while schemes scoring 16/20 or more receive the gold standard. By the end of 2010, 169 schemes had been identified as achieving a Building for Life silver or gold standard. The Building for Life awards Schemes were entered for Building for Life awards each spring by developers, housing associations, architects or planners. Entries were formally assessed against the 20 Building for Life criteria and all those achieving 14 or more received either a silver or gold standard. Schemes achieving a Building for Life standard were shortlisted for the awards. An independent judging panel then selected outstanding schemes to receive a Building for Life award. The Judging panel was chaired by Wayne Hemingway. Since 2008, the Building for Life awards judging panel included Nick Raynsford MP, Lynsey Hanley, John Calcutt, David Pretty, Yolande Barnes, Steven Carr and Jane Briginshaw. The Building for Life criteria The criteria fall into four categories, and are as follows: Environment and community 01\\\\. Does the development provide (or is it close to) community facilities, such as a school, parks, play areas, shops, pubs or cafes? 02\\\\. Is there an accommodation mix that reflects the needs and aspirations of the local community? 03\\\\. Is there a tenure mix that reflects the needs of the local community? 04\\\\.

History It was originally acted out at the Dukes Theatre, licensed by Roger L'Estrange, February 18, 1677/1678, and was printed in 1678 by J.M. for Henry Herringman. There is no record of a production of Shakespeare's original play until Shadwell's adaptation. Apart from re-writing the whole play in his own words, Shadwell adds some love interest with a mistress and a jealous fiancée for Timon. For a revival in 1694 Henry Purcell wrote some incidental music for the play, consisting of an overture and a suite of dances, and a masque with songs and choruses: it serves as an adjunct and allegory of the main play. In Zimmerman's catalogue it appears as Purcell's Z 632.Henry Purcell: Love Songs, sung by Dorothee Mields. In Act 1, scene 2 of Shakespeare's play there is a masque of Amazons. Shadwell adapted this into a bucolic frivolity in Act 2, scene 1, in which Cupid and Bacchus, with a chorus of nymphs and satyrs, dispute whether love or wine is more important. With memories of Thomas Betterton (actor-manager of the Duke's Company) in the title role and with Purcell's music, the play was revived several times up to 1745. Actors included John Mills, Barton Booth, Mary Porter, Lucretia Bradshaw, William Milward and James Quin. Synopsis Timon of Athens opens up with Demetrius discovering a poet and painter come to sell their wares to a generous nobleman named Timon. Timon supports their cause, giving more than is necessary, which leads many characters to take advantage of him. Next, a messenger comes and informs Timon that a friend of his is imprisoned, and Timon quickly offers to pay his debt. Next, an old man comes and complains to Timon about a man who is seeing his daughter, but does not have enough money to offer a proper dowry. Timon once again shows his generosity by offering the man money to promote his estate. Senators arrive for a feast that Timon is hosting, simultaneously a churlish man named Apemantus enters. Apemantus begins to rail against the excessive generosity of Timon, as well as the false intentions of the senators and nobles who shower Timon with false flattery. The senators continue to support Timon, while Apemantus says it like it is. After this spectacle, everyone leaves except for Timon and Evandra, his lover. She professes her love and he denies her. In rage, Timon sets his house ablaze and then heads to the forest to live as a life as a hermit. While digging for roots to eat, he finds large amount of gold. He is then visited by number of people from Athens. He is first visited by Alcebiades and two whores. He learns of Alcebiades' plan to wage war on Athens, and gives him some money to help fund his army. He also gives money to whores to encourage them to spread diseases around Athens. He is then visited by Evandra who questions him about his coldness to her. Next, he is visited by two lords who have heard about Timon's discovery of the gold. Timon gets angry and then sends them away. Eventually he dies. Characters Because of the nature of the written version of this play (many of the names are abbreviated or cut off or misspelled) it is difficult to create a perfect list of the characters in the play. However, this list is close to accurate. * Timon: Athenian who becomes a misanthrope and a cave-dwelling hermit after citizens take advantage of his generosity, then refuse to help him when he runs out of money. * Aelius, Isidore, Phaeax: Lords who are false friends of Timon.

In 1975 he undertook extended documentation of subjects never before broached in France; the first, \\"L’Hopital\\" was published in 1976; the second, \\"Les Incarcérés\\", on French prisons was made in 1976 and published in 1983 with extracts from his personal journal written in the first person. In 1976 his work was noticed by Marc Riboud and Bruno Barbey at Rencontres d’Arles and at their invitation in 1977 he joined Magnum.  Pleine Mer  In 1984 Gaumy started a cycle of winter voyages aboard so-called \\"classic\\" trawlers which continued until 1998 and led to the publication in 2001 of Pleine Mer (\\"Men at Sea\\"). Gaumy was aware that the open-deck trawlers, the boats on which he was photographing, were disappearing, like the Portuguese schooners that had fished for cod on the Grand Banks, their men line-fishing from open dories; competition from South American fishing vessels was too strong. Peter Nichols commended Gaumy's project and the book in a July 2002 Guardian review; \\"Men at Sea is both a rare and a beautiful book, and an archival testament of a world fast slipping away. Or already gone.\\" François Cardi's 2014 paper on the sociology of deepwater fishing uses an extended analysis and comparison of the earlier mid-century fishing-boat imagery of Anita Conti with that of Jean Gaumy.François Cardi, « Pour une sociologie de la pêche en haute mer », La nouvelle revue du travail [En ligne], 5  2014, uploaded 12 December 2014, consulté le 16 avril 2020. URL: http://journals.openedition.org/nrt/1981 ; DOI: https://doi.org/10.4000/nrt.1981 Filmmaker In 1984 Gaumy made his first film La Boucane, and it was nominated for a César in 1986 for best documentary. He followed it with other film all broadcast by French and European televisions, and winning further awards. In 1986 he made his first trip to Iran during the war, continuing visits there until 1997. His film Jean-Jacques (1987) was made during two years chronicling the town of Octeville-sur-Mer, where he lived, through the eyes of Jean-Jacques unjustly considered the \\"village idiot\\". His third feature-length film Marcel, prêtre (1994) was shot in Raulhac (Auvergne, Cantal) over a period of several years. During 2005 he researched locations in preparation for the film Sous-Marin for which he spent four months underwater aboard a nuclear attack submarine. Since then, his numerous works on human confinement have been coupled with a more contemplative photographic approach. After making his film aboard a nuclear submarine, in 2008 he started a photographic reconnaissance extending from the Arctic seas to the contaminated lands of Chernobyl in the Ukraine (2008, 2009) and Fukushima, Japan (2012). Concurrently, within the same project, he started a series of mountain landscapes that will be published in the book D’après Nature (2010) and for which received a second Nadar Prize. During 2010 and 2011 Gaumy re-embarked on voyages aboard the \\"Terrible\\", the latest French submarine SNLA dedicated to nuclear deterrence, and in 2013 joined the international scientific team BB Polar with which he went to Spitsbergen and Greenland (2013, 2014 and 2016) Bibliography *Jean Gaumy, Actes Sud.

The mine starts as a rather broad linear mine which usually runs along the middle vein or leaf-margin. A short time after, it broadens the linear mine into a blotch. In these stages the mine occupies a thin layer just above the lower epidermis of the leaf and is whitish-green in colour. In the third and fourth instars, the larva feeds on the upper layers of the tissue within the blotch-mine made during the preceding instar. At the same time, it wrinkles up the lower epidermis of the leaf to form a tentiform mine. After the consumption of the tissues within the mine, the larva leaves the mine through a round exit hole to form a cocoon.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It is situated in the grounds of Stapleford Park. History The church was built in 1783, having been designed by George Richardson for Robert Sherard, 4th Earl of Harborough. It replaced an earlier church on the site, and functioned as the Sherard family estate church as well as a parish church. Restorations were carried out in 1931 and 1967. Architecture =Exterior= St Mary's is constructed in limestone ashlar, and is in Gothic Revival style. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave, north and south transepts, a chancel and a west tower containing a porch. The tower is in three stages on a moulded plinth, with string courses, a frieze, and cornices, one of which is carved with Romanesque-style decoration. The parapet is embattled and there are pinnacles at the corners. In the lowest stage is a doorway with a Tudor arch, above which is a two-light window with a pointed arch and Y-tracery. There are similar windows on the north and south sides of the tower, each with a recessed round window below it. The middle stage has a roundel on each side, the one on the west containing a clock face. In the top stage are double lancet bell openings. On each side of the nave are three three-light windows with pointed arches, and at the west end there is on each side a niche above a roundel. The transepts have parapets, and a blank four-light lancet window in each gable. The side walls of the chancel are blank, and at the east end is a four-light lancet window with transoms, on each side of which is a niche. Over the east window is a coronet carved in high relief, and a datestone inscribed with \\"1783\\". Around the exterior of the church are carved heraldic shields containing arms of the families married to the Sherards. In the churchyard are buried the Barons Gretton and Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Eveleigh-de- Moleyns, 5th Baron Ventry, a British Army officer and Anglo-Irish peer. =Interior= The porch in the tower has an octagonal vault containing a central carved boss. The nave has a plaster coved ceiling, with an arcaded cornice, fluted brackets, and is decorated with a lozenge pattern. At the west end is a wooden gallery with a panelled dado. In the west wall of the gallery is a Coade stone fireplace, above which are the Royal arms on a roundel. The ceiling again is decorated with lozenges, and it contains a central oval dome decorated with putti. On the north and south walls of the transepts are roundels containing depictions of doves. At the east end of the chancel is a dado and a frieze, and a central marble reredos, inlaid with the motif of an anchor, and surmounted by a pediment and an urn. On each side of the east window are double lancet Commandment boards. The stalls are arranged along the north and south sides of the nave. The pulpit is octagonal and panelled, and the font consists of a marble bowl on an oak stem. Rysbrack Most of the memorials were moved from the earlier church. The oldest, dated 1490, is a brass to Geoffrey Sherard and his wife. There is a black and white marble tomb chest dated 1640. The chest bears two life-size reclining effigies and is carved with images of eleven children. There are a number of busts of members of the Sherard family. The finest memorial is that of the 1st Earl by John Michael Rysbrack. It is dated 1732 and consists of a seated woman with a child, and a half-reclining man, all in Roman clothing. There is also a memorial tablet and a hatchment to the 6th Earl, dated 1859. There is a memorial to the businessman, Conservative politician and Olympic gold medalist John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton, in the church too.

Engraved plaque containing Apostle Paul's sermon, at the Areopagus, Athens, Greece. The Areopagus sermon refers to a sermon delivered by Apostle Paul in Athens, at the Areopagus, and recounted in Acts 17:16–34... The Areopagus sermon is the most dramatic and fullest reported speech of the missionary career of Saint Paul and followed a shorter address in Lystra recorded in .. History Paul had encountered conflict as a result of his preaching in Thessalonica and Berea in northern Greece and had been carried to Athens as a place of safety. According to the Acts of the Apostles, while he was waiting for his companions Silas and Timothy to arrive, Paul was distressed to see Athens full of idols. Commentator John Gill remarked: :his soul was troubled and his heart was grieved, …he was exasperated and provoked to the last degree: he was in a paroxysm; his heart was hot within him; he had a burning fire in his bones, and was weary with forbearing, and could not stay; his zeal wanted vent, and he gave it. So Paul went to the synagogue and the Agora (, \\"in the marketplace\\") on a number of occasions ('daily'),Acts 17:17 to preach about the Resurrection of Jesus. Some Greeks then took him to a meeting at the Areopagus, the high court in Athens, to explain himself. The Areopagus literally meant the rock of Ares in the city and was a center of temples, cultural facilities, and a high court. It is conjectured by Robert Paul Seesengood that it may have been illegal to preach a foreign deity in Athens, which would have thereby made Paul's sermon a combination of a \\"guest lecture\\" and a trial.Paul: A Brief History by Robert Paul Seesengood 2010 page 120 The sermon addresses five main issues: :* Introduction: Discussion of the ignorance of pagan worship (verses 23-24) :* The one Creator God being the object of worship (25-26) :* God's relationship to humanity (26-27) :* Idols of gold, silver and stone as objects of false worship (28-29) :* Conclusion: Time to end the ignorance (30-31) This sermon illustrates the beginnings of the attempts to explain the nature of Christ and an early step on the path that led to the development of Christology. Paul begins his address by emphasizing the need to know God, rather than worshiping the unknown: > \\"As I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even > found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. So you are ignorant > of the very thing you worship — and this is what I am going to proclaim to > you.\\" Paul then explained concepts such as the resurrection of the dead and salvation, in effect a prelude to the future discussions of Christology. After the sermon a number of people became followers of Paul. These included a woman named Damaris, and Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus (not to be confused with Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite or Dionysius, the first Bishop of Paris). In the 20th century, Pope John Paul II likened the modern media to the New Areopagus, where Christian ideas needed to be explained and defended anew, against disbelief and the idols of gold and silver.

Every year, it organises numerous trade shows and congresses, which bring together leading companies from different economic sectors to showcase their new products, exchange experiences and promote business. Information of interest It hosts over 120 trade shows, congresses and corporate events per year with 30,000 exhibitors, both direct and represented, and receives 2 million visitors from over 200 countries. Its annual economic contribution to the city of Barcelona and its surroundings is estimated at over 2,600 million Euros and also brings added social and public value. Fira de Barcelona works to develop new opportunities for overseas business, especially in Asia and Latin America, geared to increasing the participation of Fira exhibitors in events in other countries, replicating some shows that are held in Barcelona and selling services, technology, management and advice to other organisers and exhibition centres. Fira de Barcelona has established itself as a global events organiser with and international positioning twinned with the unmatchable Barcelona brand, a city with over a century of tradition in the organization of big events. History Barcelona’s trade fair tradition dates back to the Exposición Universal of 1888 and the Exposición Internacional of 1929. In 1932, Fira Internacional de Barcelona was officially constituted, declared for public use and, in 2000, the Generalitat de Catalunya was incorporated in the government organs, together with the Barcelona City Council and the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce. In 2010, it revised its strategic plan named “new value proposal” in order to anticipate the future demands of the market, based on reinforcing the ranking of its shows, promoting innovation and knowledge and boosting international business. Two large venues: Montjuïc and Gran Via Fira de Barcelona has over 400,000 m2 of exhibition floor space and is one of the largest in Europe, divided into two large venues: the emblematic Montjuïc and the modern Gran Via, designed by the Japanese architect Toyo Ito. Shows The main shows held in Fira de Barcelona are: Mobile World Congress; Alimentaria; Hispack; ibtm world; International Swimming Pool Show; Hostelco, International Catering Equipment Show; Barcelona Building Construmat; Expoquimia, Equiplast and Eurosurfas; Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week; Graphispag; Automobile Barcelona; Barcelona International Boat Show; Smart City Expo World Congress; IoT Solucions World Congress Other important events are Bizbarcelona, the show for business owners and entrepreneurs; Barcelona Meeting Point; International Logistics Show (SIL); B-Travel; International Comic Show of Barcelona; Saló de l'Ensenyament; and Caravanning.  Congresses  Fira de Barcelona hosts numerous congresses and business, social, cultural and institutional events in the facilities of the Montjuïc and Gran Via exhibition centres, where the Palau de Congresos de Barcelona and the Centro de Convenciones are located, respectively. In July 2011, GSM Association, which represents the interests of over 800 mobile phone operators worldwide and over 200 companies in the extensive mobile ecosystem, chose Barcelona as Mobile World Capital for the 2012-2018 period, a title extended until 2023 in July 2015 . Barcelona Mobile World Capital is an initiative to turn the city into the permanent world centre of mobile communications, where people, companies and institutions work together to exploit the potential of mobile technologies as an element to transform daily life and create new business opportunities. Promoted by the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism, the Catalan Generalitat, the Barcelona City Council and GSMA, it is based on the MWHub and MWCongress, concerned with industrial and business development, MWCentre and MWFestival that impact people and their social life. Among other important events, Fira hosted the World Cardiology Congress in 2006 and the European Cardiology Congress in 1999 and 2009, organised by the European Society of Cardiology; the 14th World AIDS in 2002, organised by the International AIDS Society; The International Rotary Club Convention in 2002, organised by Rotary International; the United Nations meeting on Climate Change in 2009; and ITMA, the world's largest international textile machinery exhibition held in 2011 and 2019, organised by CEMATEX.

Søvnen (The Sleep), for chorus and orchestra, Opus 18, is Carl Nielsen's second major choral work. It was first performed at the Music Society (Musikforeningen) in Copenhagen on 21 March 1905 under the baton of the composer. Background The idea of writing Søvnen occurred to Nielsen in Athens shortly after he had composed the Helios Overture in early 1903. He asked Julius Lehmann whether he would like to write the text for the work but Lehmann declined. As a result, Nielsen began to write a text himself. Although he did not get very far with it, the idea behind the work comes across as calm sleep evolves into a nightmare: \\"The sons of Sleep, the Dreams, and their sisters, the Dream Sisters, rise up sleepily one by one. They are chained under the crown of the balm tree where first lazily, then attentively, they lift their heads and look in front of them... The whole world shakes and everything seems about to explode. Some voices shout for murder and blood.\\"Lisbeth Ahlgren Jensen, \\"The Sleep\\", Cantatas 1, Carl Nieslen Edition , Royal Danish Library. Retrieved 11 November 2010. However, Nielsen had difficulty in advancing with the work. On 26 November 1903, in a letter to his friend Henrik Knudsen, he explains: \\"Today I have begun work on ‘Sleep’. It is indeed high time I did begin, for tomorrow it is the 28th of November and thus just a year since Saul and David was played for the first time, and in all that time I have only managed to produce the Helios Overture.\\" In his memoirs, Svend Godske-Nielsen tells of how Nielsen appeared to escape from his difficulties when he \\"managed to write his beautiful melody for the poem Sænk kun dit Hoved, du Blomst (Lower thy head, o flower).\\" Johannes Jørgensen, who wrote the text of the song on 8 December 1903, also wrote the text for Søvnen although it is not clear how closely the two are related. In a letter to Johannes Jørgensen dated 25 July 1903, Nielsen explains:Elly Bruunshuus Petersen, \\"Carl Nielsen, Søvnen, Opus 18: En musiktekst bliver til\\", Fund og Forskning, Bind 43 (2004). Retrieved 11 November 2010. :I would like to portray sleep in music, a sort of hymn to its glory. Sleep heals all wounds and alleviates all troubles, it is the greatest good for all living creatures and the blissful state where nothing is hard and palpable but everything swims along in a long, golden eternity. Sleep has its dreams, both good and bad, but they must each return to their own quarters: for sleep can probably be disturbed but it never can be killed. (Macbeth). :It might therefore be a kind of poem in three parts. But do not be alarmed: there need not be many words and lines in each part, because unlike the other arts, music has of course the faculty of slowing down and speeding up whenever necessary. Perhaps you find the idea is not poetic or suitable for poetic treatment. But do whatever you can, dear friend, for I assure you that it is musically poetic in the highest degree. :I wish I was talented enough myself. But now permit me to explain what I would have written if I had been in a position to write the poems and shape the piece myself, though I recognize I do not have the slightest ability to do so. Just the raw ingredients, which you obviously should not take too seriously, but they will convey the direction in which I wish to go. I suggest: :I. Quietly and dreamily, the cloud veers off to the west. ::Fluffily, it rolls down below the earth's dark curve ::And the sun's last dark-red glow ::kisses — between long, lingering shadows — ::The green moss on great trees and stones ::And everything opens up and breathes long ::and deep in a tired smiling fight ::For a wealth of balm and manna and joy. :II. But out on the distant horizon ::Come ::- Dreams of bliss ::- Of evil ::- Of terror :::Help! :III. Great inquiring human eyes ::lower two by two ::their soft dull heavy lids ::and close like sleeping calyces ::who have drunk in the sun's bright crimson rays ::a day of dreams ::And sleep's soft wide waters ::flow over the whole world: :And then there might even be a look at the last long slumber. :So, dear John Jorgensen: :I. some words that express the joy of sleep :II.something that disturbs it :III.the first mood with perhaps an allusion to death. :If you would do this for me, I just do not know what I could do for you. You certainly will not regret it, because in addition to your fees, my gratitude and my friendship will certainly make a contribution. Please accept sincere greetings from my wife. She asks me to write to you that she is looking forward to meeting you and your wife in the near future, as we have to tell you about Greece and talk about Rome and many other wonderful places. But a few days later, a second letter from Nielsen to Jørgensen shows that he was not happy with the poet's first attempt. He had to explain that there was a big difference between composing for soloists and for choirs. He said that all he needed was just a few lines, similar to what those in old church compositions such as the Gloria or the Creed. Jørgensen apparently was not offended and on 21 November 1903 provided a new, more suitable text which formed the basis for Nielsen's composition although Nielsen did make a few further changes. Carl Nielsen’s rough draft for the cantata is dated 10 November 1904 while his fair copy is dated 27 November 1904. Reception During the rehearsals for the first performance, Nielsen confidently wrote to his wife Anne Marie: \\"I consider it my most noteworthy and fully conceived work so far and I think I have fully succeeded in expressing what I wanted.\\" The reviews for the first performance at the Music Society on 21 March 1905, however, were not quite as positive. Dannebrog commented: \\"In this work one again finds much of the strange and affected and the decided inclination to pile up jarring sound effects that is peculiar to this highly gifted composer. To some extent, though, these devices are justified by the words and tendency of the poetry. After an introduction that exhibits great beauty and tellingly paints the bliss of rest, 'as by the great and silent rivers that flow in peace and darkness', the composer makes a highly characteristic transition to the horrors of the night, the pernicious visions that grow into horrific hallucinations and culminate in a scream of mortal dread. This growth is carried off with considerable dramatic power and the composer really achieves the intended goal. The last section should be shortened; after the great strain the long ending, which repeats the words and mood of the introduction, has a rather fatiguing effect. Choir and orchestra performed this interesting new work excellently, and Mr. Carl Nielsen, who himself conducted, was acclaimed with a storm of applause and several curtain calls.\\" Socialdemokraten described the work as \\"a peculiar and atmospheric piece of musical poetry\\" but also picked out the beauty of \\"the gentle string textures in the prelude and the first strophes of the choir with their soothing descent into the wondrous peace of sleep.\\" Dagens Nyheder went so far as to say that the composer \\"actually seems to want to make his music cacophonous\\", while Københavns Adresseavis comments that \\"the composer’s striving to find fully realistic expression in music, combined with his penchant for originality, leads him into a chaos of distorted, disharmonic note combinations.\\" But Vort Land seems to have understood Nielsen's intentions: \\"All credit must go to this music, because it testifies to both an urge towards independence and a decided honesty. And at bottom this choral work possesses a shuddering authenticity which can only move, because it comes from a true artist’s heart...\\" When the work was subsequently performed at a concert of Nielsen's works on 12 November 1905, Socialdemokraten called the piece \\"one of Carl Nielsen’s most beautiful works\\" but Charles Kjerulf, writing in Politiken is far more critical: \\"The gravest charge against the composer in this respect was in the central section of Søvnen, the one that depicts the nightmare. This mare rides along literally in the wildest hunt of the falsest notes, which the choir cannot even hit. Every instant one gets different false notes instead, but it has no great influence on the result. During the minutes such a movement lasts, even the most well-intentioned Danish music-lover is on the point of renouncing Carl Nielsen and all his works.\\" When the work was performed some 13 years later on 11 February 1918, Dagbladet wrote: \\"Søvnen probably sounded rather inoffensive to those who have become used to the far freer and more personal expression that Carl Nielsen’s imagination finds today; all the same it is such a beautiful and evocative work that one was glad to see it unearthed from the archives.\\" Music Søvnen is a work in three movements. The first and last describe in which the composer's elysian Brahmsian style is present depict gentle and restful sleep free of worry. This blissfulness is contrasted in the middle movement by an eldritch cabalistic rite revealing the terror of a nightmare that is associated with claustrophobia and other fears of being held captive, or falling down a deep chasm. The cantata ends in a murmurous glow. Nielsen's study of the music of Max Reger greatly influenced this composition, particularly the nightmare section.\\"Nielsen, Carl August (1865-1931)\\", Composers and related artists, Cartage.org.lb.

It is part of the 99 Names of God, by which Muslims regard God and which are traditionally maintained as described in the Qur'ān, and Sunnah, amongst other places. Linguistic translation The word \\"tawwaab\\" is said to come from the root t-w-b which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to return; to return to goodness, to repent; to be restored or to be repeatedly summoned or called. The attribute, At Tawwaab, is therefore translated as \\"The Acceptor of Repentance\\". Deeper translation In his book, \\"Al-Maqsad Al-Asna fi Sharah Asma' Allahu al-Husna\\" (also known as \\"The Best Means in Explaining Allah's Beautiful Names\\"), Imam Al Ghazali translates At Tawwaab as \\"He who constantly turns man to repentance\\". He states that At Tawwaab is \\"the One Who keeps on facilitating the causes of repentance for His creatures time and time again by showing them some of His signs, by conveying to them some of His Warnings and by revealing to them some of His deterrents and cautions with the Intent that they, having been apprised of the dangers of their sins, might be filled with fear by His frightening them and subsequently turn to repentance. Through (His) accepting (the evidence of their penitence), the Favor of God Most High (once again) reverts to them.\\" Others try to explain this Attribute by stating that Allah is the One Who beckons for our return, the One Who forgives those who return to goodness, the One Who restores to grace those who repent and the One Who forgives those who forgive others. Other attributes of Allah such as Al Haleem, Al Ghaffar, Al Ghaffur and Al-Afuw give the impression that asking forgiveness for one's sin is different from seeking repentance. At Tawwaab seems to require a necessary step for forgiveness. An individual must make a sincere attempt to repent for a sin and vow not to return to it. Occurrence in the Quran The Attribute of At Tawwaab occurs frequently in the Quran in various ayat. For example, it can be found in the verses 2:128, 4:64, 9:104, 49:12, 110:3. Concept of Allah's forgiveness When contemplating how Allah deals with an individual's forgiveness, the root definition of each of these words help a great deal. In general, an individual has sins that he is aware of and sins that he is not aware of. Al Haleem has been explained to mean that Allah is forbearing and clement, where He gives an individual respite, or time to ask Him for forgiveness. Allah is not in haste to punish an individual for his sins. He even at times overlooks sins due to His attribute of Haleem. Al Ghaffur has been described as meaning Allah is \\"The Most Forgiving One\\". He forgives a particular sin, no matter how large it may be. If the person returns to the same sin, Allah is Al Ghaffar, The Very Forgiving One. Al Ghaffar gives the notion that Allah continuously and repetitively forgives an individual for his sins. If an individual returns to Allah and asks for repentance, it can be accepted due to Allah's Attribute of being Tawwab, the Acceptor of Repentance. Once Allah accepts the repentance of an individual through His infinite mercy, He can erase the sin altogether because of His attribute Affuw, and it is then as though there was no sin at all. Since man is not perfect, he repetitively sins and asks for forgiveness and seeks repentance, so the cycle of forgiveness can repeat from Allah.

The station was located between the Carlton Hill station and the Prospect Street station. The station was the easternmost of four Erie stations that served the city of Passaic, being demolished in 1963 as part of the abandonment of the railroad line through Passaic and Clifton. Passaic Park station, originally opened as part of the Paterson and Ramapo Railroad, was reconstructed in 1888 as a wooden structure. The wooden station was the common design for station depots used by the Erie Railroad, designated Type IV. The station was replaced in 1923 with a Spanish tile roof station made of concrete and stone, after six years of litigation between the railroad and the city of Passaic.  History  The station at Passaic Park was first called Passaic Bridge, as the station was located immediately westward of the line's exit from the BE Drawbridge over the Passaic River. The original station structure was built in 1888 near the grade crossing of Aycrigg Avenue and Main Ave in Passaic. The 1888 construction included two wooden structures. One the westbound side was a shelter with a baggage office, ticket agent and restrooms. The second building, on the eastbound side, was a shelter with no facilities. By August 1911, the station was renamed to Passaic Park. The site traversed what is today the southeast edge of Schevchenko Park and several homes constructed next to the park after the railroad abandoned the right of way. = Passaic demands a new station (1916 - 1922) = On November 2, 1916, the city of Passaic filed a petition with the Board of Public Utility Commissioners to demand that the Erie replace the 28-year-old wooden station at Passaic Park. The city felt that in particular, the eastbound platform at Passaic Park was a \\"menace\\" to health of their residents, facilities for drivers at the station were inadequate, and protection from the elements were not sufficient. The petition filed said the Erie had agreed that a new station at Passaic Park was necessary, and the city had appropriated land for a new facility. The Erie responded on May 1, 1917, to the petition, citing that a new station was in negotiations with the city, in which an agreement had been made to a new design based on the character of the area. However, there were problems in the design of the roof and due to the position of the railroad, a larger than affordable station was probably necessary. The railroad also said that the city's need for basic facilities is not needed, especially during the summer months and they felt this could wait until after World War I as supplies were needed for the war effort. Hearings were held in Newark on May 2 and May 9, 1917, between the city and the railroad. Testimony was given by both sides in determining the need for a station, the present situation and whether the \\"wait until after the war\\" argument, which Passaic called an excuse, was viable. The board felt the city had made a fair case to new facilities, citing that the 1888 depot, present on the westbound side of the station had a ticket office, restrooms, and a baggage office. However, ridership was more present on the eastbound side, where only stood a shelter with no ticket offices, no places for the riders to use the restroom nor a baggage office. People who wanted to use those facilities needed to walk a considerable distance, including walking down to River Road and under the railroad bridge over to the station depot at Aycrigg Avenue. The city and the railroad both agreed, that due to the 400-500 passengers that averaged at the station daily, that the new station would be built on the eastbound side rather than the westbound. The current eastbound shelter also had problems in term of size, as it was hard to fit everybody into it in inclement weather. The board also determined the shelter was unkempt and poorly ventilated for impossible usage. The site of the former Passaic Park station as viewed in June 2011 from the former right-of-way in Taras Shevchenko Park The board also looked into the war \\"excuse\\" for reasons for delay, that the railroad had to deal with the federal government in times of war, however, the railroad was not just because of that able to ignore the needs of localities. $6,000 (1917 USD) was done for station improvements by the Erie already, and the board ruled that the existing facilities at Passaic Park were the fault of the railroad, and that the railroad must approve a new station and maintain the new station. On July 18, 1917, the board declared a rehearing based on the old petition and the delay of construction due to the war. It was determined that the Erie will still have to work with the federal government in moving troops around for the war process, and that the Erie was unnecessarily delaying the improvements. The improvements were then decided to be removed from the Erie's responsibility until conditions warrant. On August 24, 1922, the board demanded that the Erie, now after the war effort, file plans on February 1, and begin improving the Passaic Park station by March 10 of the next year. The station at Passaic Park was finished in 1923, as a new Spanish-revival station with a slate roof, similar in fashion to stations at Mahwah, New Jersey and Painted Post, New York. = The Passaic Plan (1949 - 1963) = During the 1950s and 1960s, several different priorities from different agencies around the cities of Paterson and Passaic were beginning to form. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western, a competing railroad with the Erie, wanted to condense (along with the Erie) services and share trackage because of financial troubles. Secondly, the city officials in Passaic had first brought a proposal to the Erie asking about the removal of the main line through the city, which was tying up traffic in the city during station stops. This, however, was not implemented during the 1950s, as proposed. Instead, the Erie reconstructed the stations at Passaic and Clifton. Third, the New Jersey State Highway Department needed rights-of-way for Interstate 80 through Paterson and State Route 21 through Passaic. The Passaic Park station and BE Drawbridge, which spanned the nearby Passaic River, needed to be demolished to build State Route 21. After the merge on October 17, 1960, between the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western and the Erie, the city officials in Passaic once again brought back the possibility of removing the tracks through Main Street, Passaic. This time, the newly formed Erie Lackawanna Railway went forward with it, beginning the process to move its main line onto the former Boonton Branch through Lyndhurst, Passaic and Clifton. On April 2, 1963 the last train passed through the station and the former Erie main from BE Draw to Paterson. The main line was abandoned past Carlton Hill, and BE Drawbridge was swung in the open position, and soon put up for sale price of $0.00 in 1964 by the mayor of Passaic. On January 21, 1964, the city of Passaic awarded a $1,920 (1964 USD) contract to raze the Passaic Park station to Naples Excavating Company, a local contractor.

Description  TRAPPIST is controlled from Liege, Belgium, with some autonomous features. It consists of two reflecting robotic telescopes located at the ESO La Silla Observatory (housed in the dome of the retired Swiss T70 telescope) in Chile and at Oukaïmeden Observatory in Morocco. The 60 cm f/8 Ritchey–Chrétien design telescopes and New Technology Mount NTM-500 were built by ASTELCO Systems, a company in Germany. The CCD camera was built by Finger Lakes Instrumentation (USA), providing a 22 x 22 arcminutes field of view. The camera is fitted with a double filter wheel, allowing 12 different filters and one clear position. The telescope condominium is a joint venture between the University of Liège, Belgium, and Geneva Observatory, Switzerland, and among other tasks, it specializes in searching for comets and exoplanets. In November 2010, it was one of the few telescopes that observed a stellar occultation of the planetary body Eris, revealing that it may be smaller than Pluto, and it helped observe a stellar occultation by Makemake, when it passed in front of the star NOMAD 1181-0235723. The observations of this event showed it lacked a significant atmosphere. A team of astronomers headed by Michaël Gillon, of the Institut d’Astrophysique et Géophysique at the University of Liège in Belgium, used the telescope to observe the ultracool dwarf star 2MASS J23062928-0502285, now also known as . By utilising transit photometry, they discovered seven terrestrial planets, at least three of which were Earth- sized, orbiting the star; the innermost two were found to be tidally locked to their host star while the outermost appears to lie either within the system's habitable zone or just outside of it. The team published its findings in the May 2016 issue of the Nature journal. = Name = As with the other space observation projects of the University of Liège like SPECULOOS, Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope makes up a backronym, referring to traditional Belgian Trappist beer.

In its time, it was one of the best known mineral springs in Virginia, and one of the chief sulphuric thermal springs in America. Notable visitors included General Andrew Jackson and General Lafayette. Geography Botetourt Springs has two springs, one of sulphur and the other of chalybeate. An 1857 book mentioned that Botetourt Springs was a notable resort during the warmer months and that the springs contained magnesia, sulphur and carbonic acid\\". History The Carvin Lands on Carvin Creek was a 150-acre parcel granted to William Carvin in 1746. Carvin expanded the acreage and his son, William Carvin II, inherited the property. Edward Carvin inherited the Sulphur Springs homeplace and approximately 900 acres from his father, William Carvin II, in 1804. Edward sold the homeplace and 474 acres to Christian and Martin Wingart who sold the land to Charles Johnston in two transactions between 1818 and 1826. Around 1820, Johnston built a hotel and cottages around the spring, naming it Botetourt Springs after the county in which it was located. Andrew Jackson was a visitor, as was General Lafayette in 1824.Prillaman, p. 85 With the increase in travel on the road west, the hotel and its springs stayed popular through the 1830s. Johnston died in 1833 and was buried on the property. By 1839, with the opening of other hotels in the area, the popularity of Botetourt Springs ebbed and it was closed in 1839. Johnston's nephew, Edward Johnston, bought the property and converted the hotel to a school, the Roanoke Female Seminary. This seminary was unsuccessful. In 1842, the property, including the buildings and 600 acres, was purchased by an agent for Valley Union Seminary, a Baptist organization. The seminary, founded in the same year, became Hollins University. William Carver's spring house still stands on the property. By 1873, Botetourt Springs had a post office.

Early mails In its isolated location, the colony originally depended on packet ships for mail, connecting via St Thomas, New York City, or Halifax at different periods. A packet agent managed external mails from 1818, with packet handstamps known from 1820.Rossiter, Stuart & John Flower. The Stamp Atlas. London: Macdonald, 1986, p.144. The Bermuda Gazette operated a domestic mail service from 1784, later taken over by the local government. In 1859, both internal and external mail service became the colony's responsibility, with the chief postmaster being based at St. George's. First stamps Bermuda's first postage stamps were produced locally in 1848 by Hamilton postmaster William B. Perot, consisting of the words \\"HAMILTON BERMUDA\\" in a circle, with the year and Perot's signature in the middle. Known as the Perot provisionals, they are among the great rarities of philately. A crown-in-circle design used at St. George's in 1860, also rare, is attributed to postmaster James H. Thies. General stamp issues began in 1865, with a set of three (1d, 6d, and 1sh), each with a different design based on the profile of Queen Victoria. These were supplemented with 2d and 3d values in 1866 and 1873. In 1902, Edward VII was not honored with a depiction on new stamps; instead the issue depicted a Bermudian dry dock, and remained in use throughout his reign. These were the first stamps in the British Empire that did not depict the monarch's head.Development of the Bermuda Dock Issue by David Cordon The unusual practice continued, at least in part, with George V of the United Kingdom, with the low values of the issue of 1910 depicting the seal of the colony (a caravel), while the higher values (2sh and up) were large-format designs featuring the king's profile. First commemorative stamps Bermuda's first commemorative stamps were an issue of 1920, marking the 300th anniversary of representative institutions. The design consisted of the caravel seal and a profile of George V, with the inscriptions \\"BERMUDA COMMEMORATION STAMP\\" above and \\"TERCENTENARY OF ESTABLISHMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS\\" below. A second issue, in 1921, commemorated the same occasion with a completely different design, with George V in the centre and various symbols in the corners.Bermuda Postage Stamps At Bermuda Online. Retrieved 11 April 2014 Bermuda issued a pictorial series of stamps in 1936, consisting of nine stamps with seven different designs depicting local scenery. Several of the designs were reused, and three more added, for a 1938 issue featuring George VI. A commemorative issue of 1949 marked the 100th anniversary of Perot's provisional stamp.

He founded the journal Watts's Literary Guide, which later became the New Humanist magazine, and the Rationalist Press Association. His father Charles Watts was also a prominent secularist writer. Father and son are sometimes confused with each other, and Charles Albert Watts is sometimes referred to as C. A. Watts or Charles Watts Jr. Life and career Charles Albert Watts was the son of Charles Watts and his wife Kate Eunice Watts, and nephew of John Watts, all of whom were active in the rationalist and secularist movement in London, based around Charles Bradlaugh. John and Charles Watts both edited the National Reformer, and founded a radical publishing house, Watts & Co., in London in 1864. Charles Watts co-founded the National Secular Society in 1866, and became a leading spokesman for the group after his brother's death, but broke with Bradlaugh in 1877 and, in 1883, emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, leaving his son Charles Albert to run his publishing house and continue his editorial work. Madalyn Murray O'Hair, Biography of Charles Watts, American Atheists In November 1885, the younger Watts established a journal, Watts's Literary Guide. In the first issue, which sold for one penny, the then-anonymous editor set out his ambition to fill it with \\"literary gossip\\" of interest to freethinkers, together with recording \\"the best liberal publications in this country\\". It also contained details of his father's speaking tours of Canada and the US, and regular criticisms of the Christian establishment on every front, from science and metaphysics to history and poetry. Soon afterwards, he also organised the Propagandist Press Committee, which later became the Rationalist Press Association. This provided him with a large group of subscribers, and enabled him to expand the magazine in size and with a widening readership. The name was changed to The Literary Guide in 1894.Jonathan Rée, The blasphemers of Johnson's Court, New Humanist C. A. Watts himself remained anonymous. He was described as \\"...decisive but self-effacing. He encouraged controversy in his pages, though he shrank from it himself.\\" He did not allow his own name to appear in the magazine until his sixtieth birthday, in 1918. He edited the regular journal for over 60 years until his death, writing editorial content himself and drawing on contributors from a wide range of disciplines, including Annie Besant, Walt Whitman, and H. G. Wells. He also expanded the work of his business, Watts & Co., into publishing books, including a series of \\"cheap reprints\\" which made the works of such writers as Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley and John Stuart Mill available to a mass audience, at only sixpence a volume. This later became the \\"Thinker's Library\\", a series of 140 small books published between 1929 and 1951. They included essays, literature, and extracts from works by various classical and contemporary humanists and rationalists.New Humanist, A brief history of the Rationalist Association Charles Albert Watts died in 1946 at the age of 87.

The museum houses one of the largest collections of kazoos in the world. Originally established in 2007 in Seattle, Washington, The Kazoo Museum opened in its current location in Beaufort on October 6, 2010. The museum is located in the Kazoobie Kazoos Factory and features a collection of kazoos, kazoo recordings and kazoo memorabilia. History =Kazoobie Kazoos= Kazoo Kazoos is one of the world’s largest distributors of kazoos, founded by Rick Hubbard and Gayle Andrus in 1997 as an Internet retailer of kazoos. Previously based in Hilton Head Island and in Florida, the company returned to South Carolina in 2009 and settled in co-owner Steven Murray's home town of Beaufort. In this location, Kazoobie expanded into a warehouse and showroom and in 2010 added a gift shop and became home to The Kazoo Museum. =Museum founding= A forerunner of The Kazoo Museum was created by television personality and kazoo enthusiast Boaz Frankel in 2007, located in Seattle. From there the collection moved to Portland, Oregon in 2008, where it was not available for public viewing, except via The Kazoo Museum's website. At this time the collection comprised approximately 100 kazoos, including some of the first kazoos to be manufactured, and various pieces of memorabilia including books, patents, sheet music and records. By 2010 the collection had expanded to around 200 pieces. Upon the invitation of the Kazoobie Kazoos factory, the museum took up residence in Beaufort and officially opened to the public at that location on October 6, 2010. A ribbon- cutting ceremony was held at Kazoobie Kazoos on the opening day of The Kazoo Museum, attended by local people, curator Boaz Frankel and the owners of Kazoobie Kazoos. Collection Museum visitors can learn about the history of the kazoo, from its invention in the 1840s through to the present day at the museum and can tour the working factory to see modern production techniques. The museum's collection is made up of nearly 200 kazoo-related items, making it one of the world's largest private kazoo collections. All items are kept in glass cases in a dedicated building at the Kazoobie Kazoos factory. Kazoos in the collection include one used in the television program The Partridge Family, kazoos shaped like famous cartoon characters, electric kazoos and kazoos that are over 100 years old. In addition, the museum features an old press used to make kazoo parts, kazoo music sheets and various pieces of memorabilia.

He was a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper who made two first- class appearances for Somerset County Cricket Club in the late 19th century, and served as the Rector of Heathfield from 1896 until 1914. Early and personal life Edward Popham, the son of The Reverend Edward Bryan Coombe Spurway, was born in Heathfield, Somerset. He attended Charterhouse School, and appeared for the school's cricket team in a number of fixtures between 1880 and 1882. He took over from his father as Rector of Heathfield, and continued until his own death. He married Gertrude Mary Bagnall, and the couple had five sons and a daughter. Three of their sons were killed in the First World War: two of the boys, George Vyvan Spurway (1893-1918) and Richard Popham Spurway (1890-1915), attended Sherborne School and their names are recorded in the School's Book of Remembrance.Sherborne School Book of Remembrance The Spurway family had close connections with Somerset County Cricket Club; Edward's father was noted in his Wisden Cricketers' Almanack obituary as being \\"a well-known member\\" of the club, while two of his sons, Francis Edward and Michael Vyvyan played first-class cricket for the county, as did his brother, Robert Spurway. Cricket career He played the first of his two first-class matches for Somerset in 1885. Playing against Hampshire, he scored ten runs for the county in the first innings, batting at number three, and one run in the second innings at number six. Somerset lost the match by eight wickets. His next, and final first-class appearance was made almost thirteen years later, when he played as wicket-keeper for the county in a County Championship match against Gloucestershire in Bristol. In an innings defeat for Somerset, Spurway scored 15 runs after opening the batting in the first innings, but was run out for a duck in the second innings. He played regularly for Wellington Cricket Club, and for the Somerset Stragglers.

Utilizing a motion tracking camera released with the game, Your Shape guides the player through various aerobic exercises that can be tailored to target certain parts of the body. A sequel was released in 2010 titled Your Shape: Fitness Evolved for the Xbox 360. Development Your Shape was developed as a companion to the Ubisoft Motion Tracking Camera. Ubisoft's design team in Barcelona began developing the camera in 2007 after they had seen a prototype of motion tracking technology developed by PrimeSense, a company who would later provide the motion sensing functionality for Microsoft's \\"Project Natal\\" (later released as Kinect) two years later in 2009. The development of the camera also led to the development of a fitness video game to go with the camera, which spawned Your Shape. The U.S. release of the game would feature an endorsement and appearances by model and comedian Jenny McCarthy, appearing as its in-game \\"workout buddy\\" to follow along with and motivate players while performing the exercise routines. Reception Your Shape was released to mixed reviews by critics. Its motion tracking camera was met with positive reception for its ease of setup and accuracy; allowing Your Shape to not require any special accessories or controllers for use. However, reviewers also noted that a large play area was required to make the camera function with the game properly. GameSpot's Brett Todd gave Your Shape a 5.0 out of 10. While its camera was noted as a positive aspect, Your Shape was panned for taking too much of a \\"no frills\\" and female-oriented approach in comparison to other games in its category (such as Wii Fit and EA Sports Active); including few customization options and no minigames, bland routines consisting of only straight aerobics with little variation. Todd also criticized the game for containing flattering and off-putting imagery, (such as the 3D image of the player's body used as a menu (compared to an airport scanner), and showing the feed from the camera on-screen during a routine) and concluded that \\"there isn't much in Your Shape that will get you off the couch.\\" References External links * Your Shape official site * Your Shape Nintendo page * Your Shape at GameSpot Category:2009 video games Category:Exergames Category:Dance video games Category:Ubisoft games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Wii games Category:Windows games ","title":"Your Shape"},{"id":"29563716","text":"Dycheiidae is a wastebasket taxon containing problematic polyplacophora from Upper Cambrian strata in the USA.

The work was commissioned for television by the NBC Opera Theatre and uses an English language libretto by the composer. Unlike Menotti's previous television operas, such as Amahl and the Night Visitors, this opera was written with no intention of being moved to live stage performance later. Menotti intended for this work to utilize the special effects unique to television which could not be recreated in live theatre. As a result, NBC's television production of the opera is the only performance the work has received. After its March 3, 1963 broadcast the opera was mainly criticized by the press for its trite use of allegory and music which rejected the avant-garde in favour of romanticism. Critic Harold C. Schonberg stated in his review in The New York Times that, > \\"Menotti falls back on the procedures he has always used: the scraps of > canonic imitation, the stretches of parlando, the Puccini like melodies, the > banal waltz themes... [It] ended up an allegory that had all the dimension > of a Mobius strip: an example of slick television and cinema of the 1960s > wedded pretty much to music of the 1890s... On the whole Labyrinth is one of > the thinnest musical concoctions Menotti has ever put together. However, Schonberg did praise the quality of both the acting and singing given by the performers. The cast included John Reardon as The Bridegroom, Judith Raskin as The Bride, Elaine Bonazzi as The Spy, Robert White as The Old Chess Player, Beverly Wolff as The Executive Director, Bob Rickner as The Executive Director's Secretary, Frank Porretta as The Astronaut, Leon Lishner as Death, John West as Death's Assistant, Nikiforos Naneris as The Bellboy, and Eugene Green as The Italian Opera Singer. Kirk Browning directed the production with Herbert Grossman serving as conductor, Noel Taylor as costume designer, and Warren Clymer as set designer.

The founding shareholders of Al Qabas, according to the founding contract as printed in the official gazette \\"Kuwait Al-Yawm\\" are Kuwaiti Sunni merchant families Al-Nusif, Al-Kharafi, Al- Bahar, Al-Shaya, and Al-Saqer. The paper is headquartered in Kuwait City. Al- Qabas' early days were characterized by Mohammed Al-Sager, who had been its dynamic editor-in-chief since 1982 until his election in the Kuwait National Assembly in 1999. With his experience in international finance, Al-Sager had set up an international edition that was published in Paris, London and Marseilles (for the North African market). The paper had maintained the most extensive foreign correspondent staff of any Kuwaiti newspaper with large bureaus in Washington, London, Beirut, Cairo, and Moscow.  Post-Gulf War  After the liberation of Kuwait, Al Qabas discontinued its international editions. During the invasion it moved to London and was first published there on 2 August 1990. Al Qabas had a weekly supplement on environmental issues, which can be translated into English as Our Environment is Our Life. The daily had a circulation of 120,000 copies before the invasion of Kuwait in 1991. Its 2001 circulation was 79,000 copies and the paper was the third best selling newspaper in Kuwait. The paper also began its online edition which had 30,000 weekly hits in 2001. = Political stance and staff = Al Qabas had a critical approach to government of Kuwait and is a liberal publication. In April 2012, it published an editorial calling for ending the struggle within the ruling family of Kuwait, Al Sabah. The paper's editor, Mohammed Al-Sager, is a winner of the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists \\"for courageous reporting on political and human rights issues in the face of government threats of censorship and prosecution\\". The other significant editors of the daily include Abdel Latif Al Duaaij and Ahmad Bishara. The Palestinian cartoonist Naji Salim al-Ali worked for the paper in the 1980s and he was killed in 1987 while working for the London edition of the daily.On this day 1987: Cartoonist shot in London street Retrieved November 2010 BBC. Respected Arab figures also contributed to the daily, including Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz and Egyptian philosopher Fauad Zakara. = Present Day = In 2007, Mohammed Al-Sager launched a competing newspaper, Al-Jarida, and the Al-Sager family subsequently divested their ownership in Al Qabas to the remaining four families.  Tabloid style  Under the leadership of its Deputy Editor in Chief and head of its digital edition, Abdullah Ghazi Almudhaf, a son-in-law of Jassem Al-Kharafi whose family is an owner of Al Qabas, the paper has since 2018 adopted a sensationalist tabloid style, publishing a mix of real and fake news in both its print and online editions, often citing \\"informed\\" unknown sources in its local news reporting. Despite its liberal roots, Al Qabas today serves as a platform for both liberal causes and socially and religious conservative groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood.  Digital edition  In 2019, Al Qabas launched a premium digital subscription service, producing video content for subscribers. Its flagship show, The Black Box (Arabic: الصندوق الأسود) featured 32 interviews with controversial former Kuwaiti MP and academic Dr. Abdullah Al-Nafisi.

She is portrayed by British actress Laila Rouass. Maya is introduced in the ninth series of the programme as the first love and former girlfriend of John Bateman (who changed his name to Lucas North) fifteen years before the events of the series. Rouass' involvement in the series was first announced in March 2010, with her character name revealed later in May. Because Maya was only a background character, Rouass's role was limited, did not perform any stunts and had time to perform other projects. The actress liked working with Richard Armitage, who played Lucas, as she knew him for some years prior to working on Spooks. The character was met with generally mixed reviews from critics. Role in Spooks =Character arc= Maya Lahan was born in York on 20 September 1975. She became the girlfriend of John Bateman (Richard Armitage) whilst attending Leeds University. Maya was once aspired to open her own Tapas bar. When John became stuck in Dakar, he worked with Vaughn Edwards (Iain Glen) as a courier in order to get back home, but Maya remained unaware of his activities. Vaughn remembered that during their time, John would talk to him about Maya for hours at a time. However, after he was involved in the bombing of a British Embassy in 1995, John was forced to leave Maya and murder friend Lucas North, and since started masquerading as him. In the belief that John died, Maya got on with her life, becoming a doctor and enters a relationship with Vaughn (whom she knows as Michael). Fifteen years later, in the first episode of the ninth series, Vaughn visits Lucas and leaves him with several mementos of his former life, including pictures of him and Maya. Lucas finds the hospital where she works to meet her. However, Maya coldy rejects him, stating she moved on with somebody else, and that she no longer needs him. By the end of the third episode however, Lucas invites her to his home and the two have sex on a kitchen table, thus restarting their relationship. However, over the course of the series, Vaughn has been manipulating Lucas, by giving him Maya back into his life, in order to get his hands on an MI5 file named \\"Albany\\", which contain blueprints for a genetic weapon. To further force Lucas' hand in getting the file, Vaughn abducts Maya, though he was possibly doing this in order to protect her from Chinese agents who wish to acquire Albany, and threatening to rape then behead Maya should Vaughn fail to deliver. Later, Lucas finds Maya after mortally wounding Vaughn. Having confessed his past crimes to his MI5 superior, Harry Pearce (Peter Firth), Lucas intends to flee the country with Maya, and agrees to give the Chinese Albany in exchange for money, and new identities for the couple. However, Maya is approached by hired specialist, Alec White (Vincent Regan), who tells her of Lucas's past crimes. By doing so, Maya turns against Lucas, and attempts to get him to surrender. However, when Beth Bailey (Sophia Myles) and Dimitri Levendis (Max Brown) arrive, Lucas takes Maya to his car and evades them. When Beth and Demitri open fire, a bullet hits Maya in the torso, and she dies. Because a GPS tracker was placed on Maya, Lucas leaves her body behind. =Characteristics and relationships= Maya is depicted as the first love of Lucas North. Laila Rouass stated \\"she's the love of his life and he's the love of hers.\\" When he is forced to disappear, it \\"completely rocks her world.\\" Armitage meanwhile believed that Maya had an effect with every relationship Lucas had since, and having failed them all, Lucas hangs onto thinking about Maya. When Lucas returns, Maya's life is turns \\"upside down,\\" and she is angry at him because she feels betrayed by him. Armitage stated that Lucas was \\"just compelled to see her\\" after looking at photographs of them both together, and really shapes his future. Both characters go on \\"quite an interesting journey\\" because Maya moved on with her life without Lucas, and he has to fight to get her to listen to him. However, when they start to restart their relationship, Vaughn gets in the way and \\"throws water over it.\\" Rouass believes that Lucas \\"definitely\\" trusts Maya without question, and that their relationship is \\"dynamic and explosive\\" and makes them \\"question certain things.\\" Neither of them can control their relationship, which scares Maya. Iain Glen believed that Maya is also Lucas' central weakness, and his love for her becomes instrumental to his downfall. Conceptual history In March 2010, it was announced that Laila Rouass has joined the cast of the ninth series of Spooks, along with Max Brown and Sophia Myles, however at the time Sarah Brandist from the BBC refused to reveal details of the character, including the name, citing \\"we don't want to give too much away as intrigue and betrayal are at the heart of the storylines.\\" Later in May of the same year, co-star Richard Armitage announced Rouass would play a character named Maya, described as \\"an old flame of Lucas's, possibly his first love.\\" Rouass was acquainted with the series, having viewed the first two series and \\"dipped in and out of it.\\" She also stated that Maya is only a background character throughout the series, meaning her role is limited, and does not play a spy or becoming \\"part of this mafia or that mafia.\\" Due to her limited appearance, the actress was available to perform other projects, including The Sarah Jane Adventures and Conan the Barbarian, as well as spending the free time with her daughter. Rouass does not participate in any stunt work, but does appear in \\"a lot of passionate scenes.\\" Having gotten used to filming sex scenes in Footballers' Wives, Rouass noticed that while humour was involved in Footballers' Wives, Spooks was more passionate and very choreographed. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Rouass recalled one of the scenes; \\"there's one scene where we get together in the kitchen and the director was like, 'Come on, let's be honest, you haven't seen each other for years, you're not going to get all romantic, you're going to shag her on the table.'\\" Rouass liked working with Armitage during her duration on the series, having met him in Los Angeles a few years prior, as well as Iain Glen, who plays Vaughn Edwards, although she was worried that should \\"Maya let anything happen to [Lucas] I'll be one of the most hated women in the country.\\" She also admitted she had \\"no idea\\" if her character would be killed off, but said in an interview with Digital Spy, \\"at the end of the day, you just know what the show's about. You know there's a chance that you could go, but you have to embrace that.\\" Reception The character was met by generally mixed reactions from critics. Nick Bryan of Dork Adore was not convinced of the Lucas and Maya storyline, stating \\"I keep forgetting she exists whenever she's off-screen. Vicky Frost of The Guardian had mixed reactions towards the character, writing \\"let's hope that Maya turns out to be more than just a device for us to find out about Lucas' past,\\" but adds that she is not \\"holding my breath.\\" For the finale, Frost criticised the writing behind the line where Maya admits she always believed Lucas' actions when she was told \\"seemed almost giddily optimistic.\\" References Category:Television characters introduced in 2010 Category:Fictional physicians Category:Fictional people from London Category:Spooks (TV series) characters ","title":"Maya Lahan"},{"id":"29563830","text":"Sun Zarra is a 2006 Hindi-language Indian film directed by Rohit Nayyar, starring Samir Aftab, Anjana Sukhani, Kishori Shahane and Mithun Chakraborty in an extended special appearance.

History  The CJN was officially founded on February 27, 1931 by Brother Adrien Rivard of the Sainte-Croix congregation. In the beginning, the organization was supported by the Société Canadienne d'Histoire Naturelle. This society, established by Brother Marie-Victorin, in 1923, encouraged the popularization and study of natural sciences in Canada, the development of scientific research projects and the creation of connections between Canadian and international scholars. At first, the organization was described by Marie-Victorin as a structure that would allow school kids to establish connections with the members of the SCHN.(Marie-Victorin 1932 Tract n.1). In 1946 the partnership between the CJN and the SCHN became official as certain rules of its constitution were modified. Among other things, it was specified that the CJN was connected to the SCHN and that its main goals were to: a) stimulate and promote the study of natural sciences b) encourage young people to show initiative and be observant c) encourage the protection of our natural resources and the embellishment of our properties.Jean-Eudes, Marie, Les cercles des jeunes naturalistes, pages d'histoire, Éditions Sainte Anne, lachine, 1981, 96. Even though the CJN were allowed the greatest latitude under the SCHN direction, on October 29, 1957 its members decided to separate from the Society. That same year, the CJN became a non-profit organization. During the first half of the 20th century, the CJN appears to have played an important part in the teaching of Natural Sciences in Quebec. In fact, until 1964, most specifically until a Public Education Network was created, each and every school board of the province was allowed to form its own programs and handbooks. In many cases, those did not include appropriate information or activities related to Natural Sciences. In fact, at the time, the educational system was starting to be severely criticized by the French Canadian Intelligentsia (among others, Brother Marie-Victorin and André Pouliot).(Malissard 1996, 25) In that sense, the formation of \\"circles\\" among religious schools across the province, appeared as a solution to improve the educational system's image without reforming it . Until the 1970s, the circles were, indeed, almost exclusively founded among religious schools and consisted, mostly, of young girls . The movement which had blossomed in Quebec during the 1960s (with more than 30 000 members) would lose momentum in the 1970s. In fact, after the Ministry of Education was created, a lot of circles disappeared. During the last three decades the CJN has been supporting around 100 circles a year (between 1000 and 2000 members). The corporate headquarters of the CJN is still located in the administrative building of the Montreal Botanical Garden.

It then flows through the hamlets of Potter, Gorham, and Seneca Castle, and ends in the village of Phelps where it joins the Canandaigua Outlet.

The hamlet of Gorham was built in the early 1800s around Flint Creek, with several mills using the creek for power. A very large area of muckland used for vegetable crop farming was created by clearing and draining a swamp along Flint Creek located in the town of Potter. Flint Creek flows through the middle of the area and is used for irrigation. The largest portion of this muckland is run by Torrey Farms of Elba.

As a captain he saw action in command of various ships at the Battle of Beachy Head, at the Battle of Barfleur and at the Battle of Lagos during the Nine Years' War. As a flag officer Fairborne was given command of the inshore squadron in a fleet sent to the Mediterranean during the War of the Spanish Succession. The fleet was defeated at the Battle of Cádiz but later achieved a victory at the Battle of Vigo Bay. He later became Second-in-Command, under Sir Cloudesley Shovell, of the Mediterranean Fleet and was present at the siege and capture of Barcelona. After that he was given command of a squadron sent to La Rochelle and took part in the capture of Ostend. Fairborne represented Rochester as a Member of Parliament from 1705 to 1710 and also served as a member of the council of the Lord High Admiral (an office vested at that time in Prince George of Denmark). Early career Born the eldest son of Sir Palmes Fairborne, Governor of Tangiers and Margery Fairborne (née Devereux), Fairborne became a King's letter boy in 1681. Promoted to lieutenant, he commanded the fourth-rate HMS Bonadventure during the captain's illness in a successful encounter with some Salé vessels off Mamora in June 1685 and, after being promoted to commander on 12 July 1686, he was given command of the Salé prize HMS Half Moon later that month. Fairborne's patron from this time was Admiral Arthur Herbert. HMS London, a ship which Fairborne commanded in Summer 1697 Promoted to captain on 30 August 1688, Fairborne was given command of the fifth-rate HMS Richmond later that month. The fact that his mother had been left without a pension by the old regime is likely to have made Fairborne a supporter of the Glorious Revolution of November 1688. He transferred to the command of the fifth-rate HMS Phoenix in early 1689 and then commanded the third-rate HMS Warspite at the French victory at the Battle of Beachy Head in June 1690 during the Nine Years' War. After the battle the upper decks of the ship were found to be full of Dutch musket balls. Fairborne served as part of the naval brigade under the Duke of Marlborough at the siege of Cork in September 1690 during the Williamite War in Ireland before commanding the third-rate HMS Elizabeth at the Battle of Barfleur in May 1692. He commanded the third-rate HMS Monck in the fleet under Sir George Rooke, which while in charge of the Smyrna convoy, was scattered by the French at the Battle of Lagos off Cape St. Vincent in June 1693. Fairborne was given command of the first-rate HMS Victory in 1695 and then transferred to the command of the third-rate HMS Defiance in February 1696 with orders to protect the outward-bound trade in the Downs. He returned to HMS Victory in March 1697 and then transferred to the first-rate HMS London in June 1697 and to the second-rate HMS Albemarle in Autumn 1697. Fairborne was appointed to the third-rate HMS Torbay in May 1699, but as the ship was not ready, he transferred to the storeship HMS Suffolk in Summer 1699 and then took command of the fourth-rate HMS Tilbury in January 1700 with orders to sail to Newfoundland to clear the coast of pirates. Later in the year he served in the Mediterranean. Senior command Fairborne commanded the inshore squadron at the Battle of Vigo Bay in October 1702 Promoted to rear- admiral on 30 June 1701, Fairborne was knighted on 3 November 1701. After receiving the Freedom of the City of Cork,Smith, p. 229 he was given command of the inshore squadron, with his flag in the first-rate HMS St George, in a fleet sent to the Mediterranean in Summer 1702 during the War of the Spanish Succession. The fleet was defeated at the Battle of Cádiz in September 1702 but, after Fairborne transferred his flag to the third-rate HMS Essex, the fleet achieved a victory at the Battle of Vigo Bay in October 1702. After the battle he was tasked with assisting Sir Cloudesley Shovell to bring the prizes home delivering a squadron of them safely to Spithead in November 1702. In February 1703, he refused a command in the West Indies and, fearing he had been banned by the council of the Lord High Admiral from holding any future command, challenged Admiral George Churchill to a duel: both officers were subsequently arrested. Promoted to vice-admiral on 6 May 1703, Fairborne became Third-in-Command, with his flag in the second-rate HMS Association, serving under Shovell in the Mediterranean Fleet with orders to annoy the enemy, assist the allies and protect English trade.Campbell, p. 386 The ship was caught in the great storm of December 1703 and, having been torn from her anchor at Gunfleet Sands, was blown across the North Sea to the coast of the Netherlands in dreadful conditions which resulted in the loss of 28 lives from exposure and exhaustion.Charnock, p. 143–154 Nothing was heard from Fairborne for a whole month.Wyon, p. 213 After refitting at Gothenburg in Sweden the ship returned to England. Rochester Guildhall: the lower of two white plaques above the doorway reads \\"These pavements were given by the Honourable Sir Stafford Fairbourne Anno Domini 1706\\" Fairborne was given command of a squadron in the English Channel, with his flag in the third-rate HMS Shrewsbury in 1704. He became Second-in-Command, under Shovell, of the Mediterranean Fleet in Spring 1705 and was present at the siege and capture of Barcelona in October 1705. He was also elected Whig Member of Parliament for Rochester at the 1705 English general election and appointed a member of the council of the Lord High Admiral (an office vested at that time in Prince George of Denmark) in February 1706. That year he financed the laying of a new pavement outside Rochester Guildhall, the commemorative stone for which still remains in place on the front of the building. He was given command of a squadron sent to La Rochelle in May 1706 and took part in the capture of Ostend in June 1706. In each of these actions he was personally involved in dangerous inshore operations and was said to have \\"courted danger like a mistress\\".Owen, p. 10 Fairborne was promoted to full admiral on 7 January 1708 and was returned again for Rochester at the 1708 British general election. He retired as a council member in June 1708, and was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 21 December 1708. In Parliament he supported the Whig Ministry voting for the Naturalization of the German Palatines in 1709 but lost his Rochester seat at the general election in 1710 which produced a landslide victory for the Tory party in the wake of the prosecution of Henry Sacheverell which Fairborne had supported. He was offered a post as commissioner for disbanding the marines in 1713 but refused it in the vain hope that he would one day return to senior office in the Admiralty. The Tory Earl of Orford, who became First Lord of the Admiralty, ensured Fairborne never did return to office. In retirement he lived at No. 33 Golden Square in London. He died on 11 November 1742 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Family In June 1694 Fairborne married Dorothy Fane; they had three sons (all of whom predeceased him) and a daughter. Following the death of his first wife, he married Rebecca Paston in October 1708; they had one son.

Life Isaac was probably son of James Rand, who in 1674 agreed, with thirteen other members of the Society of Apothecaries, to build a wall round the Chelsea Botanical Garden.Henry Field and Robert Hunter Semple, Memoirs of the Botanic Garden at Chelsea (1878), p. 12. Isaac Rand was already an apothecary practising in the Haymarket, London, in 1700. The year of his death is given by Dawson Turner as 1743 (Richardson Correspondence, p. 125); but he was succeeded in the office of demonstrator by Joseph Miller in 1738 or 1740. Works In Leonard Plukenet's Mantissa, published in that year, he is mentioned as the discoverer, in Tothill Fields, Westminster, of the plant now known as Rumex palustris, and was described (p. 112) as \\"stirpium indagator diligentissimus ... pharmacopœus Londinensis, et magnæ spei botanicus.' He seems to have paid particular attention to inconspicuous plants, especially in the neighbourhood of London. Thus Samuel Doody records in a manuscript note: \\"Mr. Rand first showed me this beautiful dock Rumex maritimus, growing plentifully in a moist place near Burlington House\\" (Trimen and Dyer, Flora of Middlesex, p. 238), and Adam Buddle, in his manuscript flora (Sloane MSS. 2970–80), which was completed before 1708, attributes to him the finding of Mentha pubescens \\"about some ponds near Marybone\\", and of the plant styled by James Petiver \\"Rand's Oak Blite\\" (Chenopodium glaucum). In 1707 Rand, and nineteen other members, including Petiver and Joseph Miller, took a lease of the Chelsea garden, to assist the Society of Apothecaries, and were constituted trustees; and for some time prior to the death of Petiver in 1718 Rand seems either to have assisted him or to have succeeded him in the office of demonstrator of plants to the society. In 1724 he was appointed to the newly created office of præfectus horti, or director of the garden. Among other duties, he had to give at least two demonstrations in the garden in each of the six summer months, and to transmit to the Royal Society the fifty specimens per annum required by the terms of Sir Hans Sloane's donation of the garden. Lists of the plants sent for several years are in the Sloane MSS. Philip Miller was gardener throughout Rand's tenure of the office of præfectus, and it was in 1736 that Carl Linnæus visited the garden. Dillenius's edition of John Ray's Synopsis Methodica Stirpium Britannicarum (1724) contains several records by Rand, whose assistance is acknowledged in the preface, and he is specially mentioned by the illustrator Elizabeth Blackwell as having assisted her with specimens for her Curious Herbal (1737–39), which was executed at Chelsea. He is one of those who prefix to the work a certificate of accuracy, and a copy in the British Museum Library has manuscript notes by him. Rand prompted botanical artists like Blackwell, and Georg Dionysius Ehret, to make illustrations of the living herbaceous plants produced by the gardens. Rand was friends with Mark Catesby, receiving seeds he collected in the Americas and a subscriber to his seminal Natural History of the region. Page of Index plantarum officinalium ... in horto Chelseiano Rand produced two catalogues of the Garden and coöperated with the Leiden Physic Garden via Herman Boerhaave. In 1730, perhaps somewhat piqued by Philip Miller's issue of his Catalogus in that year, Rand printed an Index plantarum officinalium in horto Chelseiano.Index plantarum officinalium, quas ad materiae medicae scientiam promovendam, in horto Chelseiano. London: Imprimebat J.W., 1730. In a letter to Samuel Brewer, dated 'Haymarket, 11 July 1730' (Nichols, Illustrations, i. p. 338), he says that the Apothecaries' Company ordered this to be printed. In 1739 Rand published 'Horti medici Chelseiani Index Compendiarius,' an alphabetical Latin list occupying 214 pages. His widow presented his botanical books and an extensive collection of dried specimens to the company, and bequeathed 50s a year to the præfectus horti for annually replacing twenty decayed specimens in the latter by new ones.

Background Orwell travelled to Spain in December 1936, 'to gather material for newspaper articles etc..' and he had also, 'some vague idea of fighting if it seemed worthwhile.' He carried a letter from Fenner Brockway to Paris and dropped in on Henry Miller. He arrived in Barcelona on 26 December 1936 : \\" ... it was the first time I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle... I recognised it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for.' He had arrived with Independent Labour Party (ILP) papers and the ILP was affiliated with the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), an anti-Stalinist party. Its leader, Andrés Nin, had once been a close ally of Leon Trotsky. Nin had just been forced out of the Catalan government, a result of Communist influence which had grown in Spain since the first Russian supply ships had arrived in October 1936. In July 1936 the POUM paper La Batalla condemned the Moscow Show Trials - the Spanish Communists were complaining about the anarchists and 'Trotskyists'. In September general Alexander Orlov of the NKVD arrived in Madrid. Communist influence and Orlov's power began to extend itself throughout Republican Spain. Orwell did not know at this time that the POUM was quite separate from the Communist-dominated International Brigade. After Orwell had spent 'a day or so absorbing the atmosphere he told McNair [the ILP's Barcelona representative] that he had decided to enlist. A 20-year-old journalist, Victor Alba, from La Batalla had spent some time showing him the scenes of the July street fighting and given him the story of what had happened in Barcelona. From Barcelona Orwell was sent to Alcubierre on the Aragon Front. Argument of the essay In the first part of the article Orwell argues that in the case of the Spanish Civil War, even more than pro-fascist newspapers like the Daily Mail, left-wing papers such as the News Chronicle and Daily Worker had \\"prevented the British public from grasping the real nature of the struggle.\\" \\"... the Spanish government (including the semi-autonomous Catalan Government) is far more afraid of the revolution than of the Fascists.\\" Orwell describes the imprisoning of those whose opinions were too much to the left and that the people responsible for putting them there were the Communists: \\"The real struggle is between revolution and counter-revolution;... Communism is now a counter-revolutionary force;... using the whole of their powerful machinery to crush or discredit any party that shows signs of revolutionary tendencies.\\" \\"In the face of Franco's foreign mercenaries [the Government] were obliged to turn to Russia for help, and though the quantity of arms supplied by Russia has been greatly exaggerated, the mere fact of their arrival brought the Communists into power... the Russians were able not only to get money for their weapons, but to extort terms as well. Put in their crudest form, the terms were: 'Crush the revolution or you get no more arms'... it may be, that the spectacle of a genuine revolution in Spain would rouse unwanted echoes in Russia.\\" In the second part of the essay Orwell describes the Communist propaganda that denounced 'Trotskyism' : \\"In Spain, anyone professing revolutionary Socialism is under suspicion of being a Trotskyist in the pay of Franco or Hitler.\\" If the Communists had saved the Government from October 1936 onwards they had also, Orwell wrote, \\"succeeded in killing enthusiasm... it is significant that as early as January of this year [1937] voluntary recruiting had practically ceased.\\" Difficulties finding a publisher Orwell and his wife Eileen left Spain on 23 June 1937, escaping the Stalinist purges, and headed at first for the seaside for a holiday and went to Banyuls-sur-Mer. \\"Their holiday was not a success. Orwell found the place 'a bore and a disappointment'. It was chilly weather, a persistent wind blew off the sea, the water was dull and choppy.... Orwell could not help feeling that his time would be better spent in writing articles which would 'spill the beans' about communist duplicity. He began writing such a piece in Banyuls, and sent a wire to the New Statesman asking if they would like to have it when he reached London. They said yes.\\" Orwell worked as quickly as he could to finish his piece which he called 'Eye-witness in Barcelona'. When he arrived in London at the end of June he submitted the piece to the New Statesman - but Kingsley Martin, the editor, took exception to Orwell's conclusions and refused the article on the grounds that it would 'cause trouble'. Later that summer, when Philip Mairet published 'Spilling the Spanish Beans' in the New English Weekly Orwell wrote, \\"People who ought to know better have lent themselves to the deception on the ground that if you tell the truth about Spain it will be used as Fascist propaganda.\\" Orwell biographer Michael Shelden: \\"No doubt he had Kingsley Martin and Gollancz in mind....\\" References External links * Category:1937 essays Category:POUM Category:Works about the Spanish Civil War Category:Essays by George Orwell Category:Works originally published in The New English Weekly ","title":"Spilling the Spanish Beans"},{"id":"29564038","text":"Fairborne may refer to: * Stafford Fairborne (Royalist), English soldier of the English Civil War * Palmes Fairborne (1644–1680), English soldier and Governor of Tangier * Stafford Fairborne (1666–1742), English MP * Marissa Faireborn, a fictional character from the Transformers series ","title":"Fairborne"},{"id":"29564045","text":"DeJuan Michael Newton (born November 11, 1987) is an American football safety who is currently a free agent.

Medicare considers the Institute's research in determining what sorts of therapies it will cover, although the institute’s authorizing legislation set certain limits on uses of the research by federal health agencies. Funding PCORI is funded through the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF), which was authorized by the United States Congress as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and reauthorized through the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020.

Published in October 2010, in hardback, audio and e-book formats, the book chronicles Richards' love of music, charting influences from his mother and maternal grandfather, through his discovery of blues music, the founding of the Rolling Stones, his often turbulent relationship with Mick Jagger, his involvement with drugs, and his relationships with women including Anita Pallenberg and his wife Patti Hansen. Richards also released Vintage Vinos, a compilation of his work with the X-Pensive Winos, at the same time. It has been reported that publisher Little, Brown and Company paid an advance of $7.3 million, after seeing a ten-page extract. Co-writer James Fox interviewed Richards and his associates over a period of five years to produce the book. Life was generally well received by critics and topped The New York Times non-fiction list in the first week of release. Synopsis Richards's memoir includes the founding of The Rolling Stones in 1962; he is pictured here in 1965 before a Stones show Life is a memoir covering Keith Richards's life, starting with his childhood in Dartford, Kent, through to his success with the Rolling Stones and his current life in Connecticut. His interest in music was triggered by his mother, Doris, who played records by Sarah Vaughan, Billy Eckstine and Louis Armstrong, and his maternal grandfather, Augustus Theodore Dupree, a former big band player, who encouraged him to take up the guitar. In his teens he met up with Mick Jagger, who he had known in primary school, and discovered that they both shared a love of blues music. In the early 1960s Richards moved into a London flat, shared with Jagger and Brian Jones. Together with Bill Wyman, Ian Stewart and Charlie Watts, the Rolling Stones were founded in 1962, playing gigs at Ealing Jazz Club and the Crawdaddy Club. The book chronicles Richards's career with the Stones since 1962, following their rise from playing small club gigs to stadium concerts, Richards's drug habits, his arrests and convictions. His relationships with a number of women, including Anita Pallenberg, Marianne Faithfull, Ronnie Spector and Patti Hansen, whom he married in 1983, are covered in detail. The often difficult partnership between Richards and Jagger is referred to throughout the work and coverage of this has caused much media interest. Throughout the work, much attention is given to Richards' love of music, his style of playing and chord construction. His non-Stones projects, such as the X-Pensive Winos and recording with the Wingless Angels in Jamaica, as well as collaborations with Chuck Berry and Gram Parsons amongst others are covered in some detail. Production James Fox, journalist and author of the non-fiction book White Mischief: The Murder of Lord Erroll, was credited, along with Keith Richards, as co-author. He had previously interviewed Richards in 1973 and the pair had been friends since then. Reportedly, $7.3 million was paid for the work in 2007, \\"on the basis of a 10-page excerpt\\". Fox spent \\"hundreds of hours\\" with Richards at his Caribbean home, and also in the United Kingdom, to gather material for the book. Cover Photographed by David LaChapelle. He interviewed Richards at length and also talked to many associates. Fox said of Richards, \\"I'd have to catch him like a salmon.\\" The interviews were conducted seated at a table, but the two were not opposite each other. Richards always played music, so Fox provided him with a lapel microphone. The subject matter was not handled chronologically; Fox allowed his subject to mentally \\"dart about\\". \\"Some sessions lasted hours and some, dealing with the more painful parts of Richards' life, lasted just minutes.\\" The project took five years to complete. \\"Once the manuscript was complete, he [Fox] sat opposite Richards and read the entire book aloud to him ... He turned out to be a really natural editor. He cut according to the sound of it.\\" Rebecca Dana of The Daily Beast said of Life that it \\"covers all the bases: sex, drugs, guitar riffs, the size of Mick Jagger’s endowment. It also digs down into softer spots, including Richards’ tumultuous relationship with Anita Pallenberg and the death of their son. The book, which already seems to have earned a place in the admittedly small canon of genuinely great rock lit, is dishy but not lurid, technical but not wonky. Richards’ voice, filtered through Fox’s brain, is so relentlessly endearing, no less a critic than Maureen Dowd has declared the prince of darkness a \\"consummate gentleman.\\" Time's Richard Corliss writes \\"Confessional autobiographies, unless they're by William Boroughs, tend to have inspirational endings: salvation through strong will or a good woman. Life has both.\\" Publication American actor Johnny Depp helped read the audiobook edition of Life Life was published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the United Kingdom and by Little, Brown and Company in the United States on 26 October 2010. It debuted, and spent two weeks, at the top position on The New York Times hard-back non-fiction best-sellers' list. It spent six weeks on the USA Today's best sellers' list, peaking at the third position. A 22.5-hour audio book version, read by Richards, Johnny Depp and musician Joe Hurley, was also published. The book is available as a digital download and has also been published in e-book format. A paperback version was published in May 2011. Coinciding with the publication of Life, Richards released Vintage Vinos, a compilation album featuring tracks from three albums by his band, the X-Pensive Winos, as well as some previously unreleased material. The BBC television arts programme The Culture Show broadcast a special on 28 October 2010, consisting of a 60-minute interview with Keith Richards, conducted by Andrew Graham-Dixon. The programme covered \\"his childhood in Dartford, his passion for music and the decade that catapulted the Rolling Stones from back- room blues boys to one of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands in the world\\". It included contributions from co-writer James Fox, Dick Taylor, former Stones PA Georgia Bergman and Bobby Keys and covered the same territory as the book. The programme was repeated on 12 November 2010. Reception Richards's (right) relationship with Mick Jagger (left) has been a source of highly acclaimed music as well as deep personal conflict for decades The book was generally well received by critics, with several commenting on the honesty of the work. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote, \\"Life offers much more than vicarious thrills. It captures the true spirit of rock and roll, the nitty- gritty of life on the road, and just what it feels like to be a heroin addict who doesn't know where his next fix is coming from. It also movingly captures Richards' extraordinary love of music—an even more powerful addiction for him than smack—and perhaps more surprisingly, his manifest destiny as a human being.\\" Jim Fusilli of the Wall Street Journal said that \\"Mr. Richards writes with disarming introspection about his childhood, family and fame. And it's quite likely that no rock musician has ever written so keenly about the joys of making music. With a warm sense of humor and willingness to share his grief, Mr. Richards in \\"Life\\" defies almost every public perception about him.\\" In The Independent, John Walsh commented, \\"He tells it with complete, reckless, disclosure. Sometimes it sounds like a man ranting into a tape machine; sometimes, in the tidier and more reflective sections, you can detect the hand of his co-writer, James (White Mischief) Fox. But the watchwords of this book are honesty, confessionalism, telling it straight.\\" The New Yorker said of Life, \\"Half book, half brand extension, it's an entertaining, rambling monologue, a slurry romp through the life of a man who knew every pleasure, denied himself nothing, and never paid the price.\\" The New York Times said, \\"Mr. Richards, now 66, writes with uncommon candor and immediacy. He's decided that he's going to tell it as he remembers it, and helped along with notebooks, letters and a diary he once kept, he remembers almost everything.\\" The popular press focused on the relationship between Jagger and Richards. Tom Bryant in The Daily Mirror wrote, \\"Keith says his songwriting partner 'started to become unbearable' in the early 80s, adding: 'I think Mick thinks I belong to him but I haven't been to his dressing room in 20 years.'\\" Awards The audiobook Life won two prestigious Audie Awards for 2010—Audiobook of the Year and Best Biography/Memoir. Additionally, the audiobook Life was voted Amazon's No. 1 Audiobook of the Year for 2010. Life received the 2011 Norman Mailer Prize for biography.

Lloyd, John (1972) The Township of Chorlton-cum-Hardy. Manchester: E. J. Morten; pp. 98–99 The first headmaster was A. F. Chappell, appointed in 1925. During Second World War it was twice evacuated to Fleetwood, owing to the Blitz; school records for the period during the war are sketchy, as the boys were moved around multiple times. The first headmaster retired in 1951 and was succeeded by Mr Merriman a year later. In 1952 it became a grammar school as pupil numbers started increasing again. The third and final headmaster was C. A. Crofts, appointed in 1963. There was at one time a lower school in Darley Avenue (formerly Barlow Hall School). =Comprehensive= During the 1960s it returned to its comprehensive roots. The existing building of Chorlton High School at Nell Lane (built in the early 1960s) replaced the old school at Sandy Lane (Corkland Road), which was formerly Chorlton Grammar School; in the early years it was called Oakwood High School. Chorlton Grammar School on Corkland Road merged with Barlow Hall Secondary Modern School in 1967, when all of Manchester's secondary state schools became comprehensive. Oakwood High School was the name give to the school, formed by the amalgamation of Wilbraham High School and Chorlton High School in the early 1980s. The current site of Chorlton High School at Nell Lane, was the original site of the Wilbraham High School Upper School. It was designated a specialist Arts College in 2002.Arts College In May 2012, the school governors approved the controversial decision to convert into an academy. The school became an academy on 1 January 2013. =Coronavirus pandemic= Due to the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in the United Kingdom, the school, along with all of the schools in the UK, was shut in March 2020 until further notice, leaving students into home learning.

By accident, she comes to the attention of the king, in a minor way at first, is helped to a position as a lady in waiting for the then bastard Lady Mary, Henry's eldest daughter, by her old Latin tutor Nicholas Udal. Udal is a spy for Thomas Cromwell, the Lord Privy Seal. As Katharine becomes involved with the many calculating, competing, and spying members of Henry VIII's Court, she gradually rises, almost against her will, in Court. She is brought more to the attention of the King, becomes involved with him, is used by Cromwell, Bishop Gardiner and Thomas Cranmer as well as the less powerful though more personally attached Nicholas Throckmorton. Her connection to the latter puts her in some peril, as in January 1554 he is suspected of complicity in Wyatt's Rebellion and arrested, during which time Katherine is also briefly implicated. Katharine's forthrightness, devotion to the Old Faith and learning are what make her attractive to the King, along with her youth and physical beauty. This is in direct contradiction to the way historians view the historical personage herself; that is, as a flighty and flirtatious young woman with few other redeeming qualities. Historical accuracy and as a work of historical fiction William Gass states, in the afterword to the 1986 edition, that Ford takes great liberties with historical evidence, even into the improbable, inventing much of the dialogue and settings. He concludes that the writing is more to \\"entertain, rather than instruct, his readers.\\" Style The main strengths of this trilogy are considered by many writer admirers and critics — notably Graham Greene, Alan Judd and William Gass — to be its impressionistic qualities, its creation of a believable approximation of Tudor English and its successful creation of atmosphere. One critic stated that it was clearly a work of literary fiction, inescapable, and should be avoided by any reader who prefers a more opaque style. Graham Greene has written that \\"in The Fifth Queen Ford tries out the impressionist method.\\" He likens the King to a \\"shadow\\" with the story focusing on the struggle between Katharine and Cromwell. Begging the question of whether the King's lighting is more like a stage production than novel, again alluding to a fictionalisation rather than truly historical style. Alan Judd, in his 1991 biography of the author, states that this version does not \\"hinder the sense of reality\\" in its effective style portraying a contrivance of Tudor English. He likens the author's dialogue to poetry. Cinematic qualities In book's 1986 edition afterword, William Gass writes that it is \\"like Eisenstein's Ivan: slow, intense, pictorial, and operatic.\\" He also associates the writing with art. In his biography of the author, Alan Judd also compares it to a film in how it creates \\"static scenes\\" that suggest \\"power, fear, sex, longing, guile and fate.\\" Critical assessment of achievement For biographer, Judd, he comments that as the author's first novel, he feels confident that it might have a chance of remaining in print if Ford had written nothing else. Judd even maintains that it could be a \\"masterpiece\\" of its genre (historical fiction). On the back cover, Greene concludes that this may be one of \\"three great novels\\" (The Fifth Queen trilogy, The Good Soldier, and Parade's End), that may stand the test of time \\"compared with most of the work of his successors.\\" Collected Editions * The Bodley Head Ford Madox Ford: Vol. 2: The Fifth Queen; Privy Seal; The Fifth Queen Crowned (1962) eds.

Jake Eberts of Goldcrest said he was reluctant to invest in the film but had been persuaded by David Puttnam's enthusiasm for the director. The film was a financial disappointment and Goldcrest made a loss of £120,000. In a review in The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote \\"As befits an English country house mystery, the film has enough wood paneling, wildflowers and overall gentility to appeal to the genre's most ardent fans. But a couple of the film's transitions are abrupt enough to make the head spin, and its final action sequences are woefully perfunctory. The denouement is as disappointing as Mr. Petit's inability to breathe life into Cordelia, her sleuthing and her peculiar obsession.\\" A review in Variety summarized; \\"Perhaps it is unfair to unravel this tale which is handled from a distance by director Christopher Petit robbing it of a more forceful narration, timing and revelation.\\"Variety Review: ‘An Unsuitable Job for a Woman’ References External links  Category:1982 films Category:1980s crime films Category:British films Category:British crime films Category:English-language films Category:Detective films Category:Films directed by Chris Petit ","title":"An Unsuitable Job for a Woman (film)"},{"id":"29564450","text":"Mount Harmer () is an ice-covered peak, high, in the north-central portion of Cook Island, in the South Sandwich Islands.

The Elferrat (German for \\"council of eleven\\") is the council of a kingdom of fools in a carnival. Development The Elferrat was originally introduced in the Rhine carnival reform in 1823 and has its roots in the region in Germany west of the Rhine, from France after the French Revolution. French became the language of trade, and French laws were in use. In connection with the revolution, this helped develop civil and political rights, with a level of freedom of speech and equality of citizens in front of the law. With Napoleon's defeat, this came to an end, and Absolutism was restored. In Mainz, the Austrians and the Prussians formed the military authority in conjunction. Cologne, the first free imperial city, came to be ruled by the Prussians. The eleven in the Elferrat The citizens robbed of their rights came to view the number eleven as a symbol of the French Revolution, because it symbolised equality among the people, that is to say one beside one. The German word elf (eleven) can be seen as an abbreviation \\"ELF\\" for the motto of the French Revolution: Egalité, Liberté, Fraternité - \\"equality, liberty, fraternity\\". The Elferrat of a small carnival metropol in northern Germany, shown on the facade of a building. This abbreviation was subsequently frequently used in the French Revolution and by Napoleon as a logo. It first became a motto in the start of the French Third Republic in 1871, and later explained as the main motto of the revolution in retrospect. During the revolution, it was only one three-word motto among many, such as \\"health, might, unity\\" and \\"might, equality, justice\\", which are nowadays found in historical documents much more seldom than the famous motto \\"equality, liberty, fraternity\\". The Elferrat thus thought of themselves as a council of citizen peers, hidden under fool's hats. The Elferrat in modern carnivals Although eleven male (in some places, also female) members of the Elferrat can be seen on stage in the official meeting in a carnival, it is mostly composed of a greater number of men. In some cities, there are special female councils, such as the Achterrat in Freiburg, because the traditionally male-dominated associations usually leave women only in the role of majorettes, not in these representative positions. In many associations, so- called honorary Elferrats are nominated, mostly consisting of distinguished association members or supporters such as politicians, businessmen and so on. =Duties= The Elferrat plans and organises various details of the carnival in its sessions, such as dances, carnival meetings and the move routes of the carnival.

As Mr. Stoner's career progressed, he worked as the chief architect for Lang Brothers Realty. In addition to many beautiful homes west of Twin Peaks and elsewhere in the Bay Area, Mr. Stoner designed the Carolands Gatehouse as well as the 'Tropic Beach' façade of the Sutro Baths and the building that housed Sally Rand's Nude Ranch at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exhibition on Treasure Island. A veteran of World War I, Stoner was not only associated with some of the Bay Area’s most historic events, places, and figures, but was responsible for creating some of its most charming architecture, including four San Francisco Chronicle model homes toured by thousands in the 1920s. His artistic designs graced the covers of Walter Dixon’s Home Designer and Garden Beautiful Magazine and were featured on the Golden Gate International Exposition Model Home Tour in 1939. A master of Period Revival designs, including what we now call Storybook style, he excelled at all phases of the Bay Area architectural tradition, from collaboration with noted landscape architect Thomas Church, to creating what renowned architectural historian David Gebhard lauded as “one of the country’s most elegant Art Deco designs.”.

W. Root. It is the phenomenon where an increased proton or carbon dioxide concentration (lower pH) lowers hemoglobin's affinity and carrying capacity for oxygen. The Root effect is to be distinguished from the Bohr effect where only the affinity to oxygen is reduced. Hemoglobins showing the Root effect show a loss of cooperativity at low pH. This results in the Hb-O2 dissociation curve being shifted downward and not just to the right. At low pH, hemoglobins showing the Root effect don't become fully oxygenated even at oxygen tensions up to 20kPa. This effect allows hemoglobin in fish with swim bladders to unload oxygen into the swim bladder against a high oxygen gradient.Verde, C., A. Vergara, D. Giordano, L. Mazzarella, and G. di Prisco. 2007. The Root effect - a structural and evolutionary perspective. Antarctic Science 19:271-278. The effect is also noted in the choroid rete, the network of blood vessels which carries oxygen to the retina. In the absence of the Root effect, retia will result in the diffusion of some oxygen directly from the arterial blood to the venous blood, making such systems less effective for the concentration of oxygen.

He was one of the signatories of the Kentish petition in 1701. Early life Polhill was the second son of Thomas Polhill of Otford, Kent and his wife Elizabeth Ireton, daughter of Henry Ireton, and granddaughter of Oliver Cromwell. Polhill's elder brother died, leaving him in possession of his father's inheritance. In December 1692, he was given a licence to travel to Holland which became the start of an extended Grand Tour. He visited Hanover, Brunswick, Zell, Austria, Geneva and Italy where he was at Padua University in 1694. He returned to England in the autumn of 1696. Career Polhill was added to the Kentish lieutenancy in 30 July 1697, and also became a Freeman of Dover in 1697. He was appointed to the Commission of the Peace (J.P) in March 1699 and was steward of the honour of Otford from 1700 to 1705. In 1701 he became Freeman of Sandwich when he stood there for Parliament. He became notable as one of the contributors to the Kentish Petition of 1701, which urged unanimity on the House of Commons and the swift vote of supplies for the army.Parishes: Otford, The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 3 (1797), pp. 19-31. Date accessed: 15 November 2010 The others were Thomas Meredith and William Colepeper, Justinian Champneys, and William Hamilton the third son of James Hamilton. He was ordered into custody by the Commons on 8 May 1701 for presenting the petition. On his release, he lost his place on the county bench and his lieutenancy. In 1705 he was freeman of the Company of Free Fishermen of Thames and Medway. After Lord Rockingham became lord lieutenant of Kent in 1705, Polhill was reappointed a deputy lieutenant, and restored to the bench in March 1706. Polhill was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Kent at a by election on 11 January 1710 but had little time in Parliament to do other than vote for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. He became a Freeman of Rochester in 1710. He was defeated at the 1710 British general election and did not stand at the 1713 British general election. He was appointed High Sheriff of Kent for the year 1714 to 1715. Polhill was appointed warden of Rochester Bridge in 1716 and keeper of Walmer Castle in 1718. He was elected MP for Bramber at a by-election on 16 February 1723. At the 1727 British general election, he switched to Rochester, where he was brought in by the Administration as MP. He was returned again in a contest at the 1734 British general election but was defeated in 1741.

It has global market share in CNC machine tools such as CNC lathes, machining centers, and turn-mill machining centers. The company also offers FA (factory automation) products and servomotors. It is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a component of the Nikkei 225 stock index. History The company was founded in 1898, as the Okuma Noodle Machine Co., to manufacture and sell noodle-making machines. Eiichi Okuma, the founder of the original company, was working on how to make udon more effectively. He was using lathe to make \\"sticks\\", that has an important role in cutting the udon noodle. But the lathes used in those days in Japan were of poor precision. This was one of big reasons which convinced Okuma to start making machine tools. In 1918 Eiichi established Okuma Machinery Works Ltd. and started selling the OS lathe. Okuma is a machine tool builder with a history of more than 100 years. Lathes were the main product category in the early days of company. The line now includes many CNC machine tools, including lathes, machining centers (mills), multitasking (turn-mill) machines, and grinding machines. Okuma's Double- Column Machining Center has a large market share in Japan. Technological development An Okuma MULTUS U3000 multi-tasking machine with automatic tool changer at Lampin Corporation in the Blackstone Valley of Massachusetts. Most machine tool builders source their CNC controls from partners such as Fanuc, Mitsubishi Electric, Siemens, and Heidenhain. Several builders have developed their own CNC controls over the years (including Mazak, Okuma, Haas, and others), but Okuma is unusual among machine tool builders for the degree to which it designs and builds all of its own hardware, software, and machine components. This is the company's \\"Single Source\\" philosophy. Okuma's CNC control is called the \\"OSP\\" series. It offers closed-loop positioning via its absolute position feedback system. The \\"OSP\\" name began as an abbreviation for \\"Okuma Sampling Pathcontrol\\". In an industry that pushes hard for continual technological innovation, Okuma has often been an innovative leader. For example, it has been among the leaders of development for thermal compensation and collision avoidance. Thermal compensation is designing the machine elements and control to minimize the dimensional distortion that results from the heat generated by machining. This is done both by preventing heat buildup (for example, flowing coolant through machine elements formerly not cooled) and by detecting and compensating for temperature rises when they occur (for example, monitoring temperature with a sensor and using the sensor's output signal as input to the control logic). Collision avoidance is designing the machine to predict and prevent interference, for example, having the machine \\"know\\" the form and location of all fixturing so that it can foresee a crash and stop its own movement before crashing. Recent innovation includes technology to avoid chatter, both by predicting and preventing it and by early automatic detection and correction (via dynamic changes of speeds and feeds) when it does occur.

He was the illegitimate son of Pero Jaques, and was legitimized by D. João II (1481–1495) and was later made a nobleman by the Royal House of D. Manuel I (1495–1521). He married a daughter of Francisco Portocarreiro, with whom he had three children. In 1503 he first came to the coast of Brazil in the fleet commanded by Gonçalo Coelho. In 1516, in command of two caravels, he was in charge of patrolling the coast of Brazil in order to discourage incursions by French pirates. In November of that year he landed in a large bay, which he named Baía de Todos os Santos (Bay of all Saints). In Río de la Plata he fought and imprisoned many French. He traveled up and down the coast until 1519. On 21 July 1521 he sailed from the mouth of Rio Tejo (Tagus) to Brazil, founded an outpost in Itamaracá, Pernambuco, one of the most popular anchorages on the Brazilian coast, where there was plenty of Brazil wood (Caesalpinia echinata) and had frequent contacts between Natives and Europeans, before going south to Río de la Plata and entering the Parana River for about 23 leagues (around 140 km) to near the present city of Rosario for the first time. Finally, in 1526, he was appointed, by King João III, as Governor of all Parts of Brazil, replacing Pero Capico in Pernambuco, and returned again in command of a ship and five caravels, having countless battles with French pirates. In 1527 he imprisoned three French galleons in Recôncavo, Bahia. But having acted with barbarity towards the prisoners, this gesture eventually caused him major problems with D. João III (1521–1557). Upon returning to Portugal, he made an offer to the King, in which Jacques would take one thousand colonists, at his own expense, to begin the permanent occupation of the new lands in Brazil, but nothing came of the proposal. Records show that, only four years after the Portuguese arrived in Brazil, the French traveled the shores of Rio Paraguaçu, dealing with the natives. The official discovery of the river is, however, attributed to Cristóvão Jacques, commander of the expedition bodyguards in 1526. Three rivers flow into the Bahia de Todos os Santos - the Jaguaripe, the Subaé and Paraguaçu. The Paraguaçu is the longest, with 600 km long, which made it be called \\"big river\\" in Indian language. Subaé River, which borders Santo Amaro, Bahia would be the river of sugar mills, the Jaguaripe River that is present in the city of Nazaré, Bahia, the river of flour, and Paraguaçu, with its length, the river of penetration into the captaincy. In a letter from Frei Vicente do Salvador, it is recorded that Christóvão Jacques found an island (already controlled by the French), on the lower river course of the Paraguaçu two ships that traded with the Indians, and were properly sunk. At the site there would be a town later named village of Nossa Senhora do Rosário da Cachoeira, in the early 17th century allotment of Gaspar Dias Adorno, ideal for penetration of the captaincy.
