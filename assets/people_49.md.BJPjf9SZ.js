Career The first programme he directed was the three-part documentary The Romanians are Coming, screened on Channel 4 between 17 February and 3 March 2015. Bluemel visited Baia Mare, a town in north Romania and was shocked to see the living conditions of the Roma community there. The documentary focuses on Sandhu, a member of this community, who decides to come to the United Kingdom. The documentary also follows Mihaila a middle-aged nurse, who comes from more comfortable circumstances in Constantia on the Black Sea coast. Other people featured are Stefan, who works as a human statue whilst raising money for his daughter's operation and Adi, who sleeps rough so he can send more money back to his wife in Romania. In 2016 his three-part documentary Exodus: Our Journey to Europe was aired. For directing this Bluemel won the 2017 British Academy Television Craft Award for best factual programme. At the award ceremony Bluemel broke with convention to allow Hassan Akkad - one of the refugees featured in the programme - to participate in the acceptance speech. In July 2020, PBS Frontline released the documentary feature Once Upon A Time In Iraq, directed by Bluemel, recounting the lead up to the Iraq War and its consequences for the Iraqi population. The documentary was criticized by some for inaccurate representation of the Iraqi experience throughout the initial conflict and its aftermath. Filmography *Pompeii... Live!

An extant chardiwarrah-style tomb near Akbarpur bears a Persian inscription that identifies it as the tomb of one Malik Wishal Khan, the daroga of Rohtasgarh under Shah Jahan. Malik Wishal Khan had the tomb built for himself and his family, and construction took place between 1636 and 1638. The inscription goes on to identify the town of Akbarpur as one of the parganas that made up the jagir of Ikhlas Khan, the commander of Rohtasgarh at the time. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Akbarpur became a stronghold of the rebel leader Kunwar Singh. In October 1858, mutineers from the Ramgarh battalion took up a position in Akbarpur after being defeated at Chatra. They were joined by some of Kunwar Singh's troops, but they were defeated by the British and forced to retreat. In 1921, Akbarpur had a population of 2,037.

It is bounded to the north and east by San Jose, to the south by Linabo and Aglayan, and to the west by Magsaysay. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 3,233 people.  Profile  Laguitas is located on a fertile valley along the Sawaga River. Most of the land is dedicated to agriculture and areas along the national highway are dedicated for residential and commercial purposes. Thus, economy is mainly driven by agriculture, where pineapple is the major crop. Other crops produced in significant volume include banana, sugarcane, and corn. There is little commercial activity and there are few industries. A future sports complex facility is to be built in Laguitas by the national and provincial government. Laguitas is subdivided into seven purok and has three sitios: Kiocab to the south, Manlungay on the west bank of the Sawaga, and Balangbang to the east side of the Sawaga. There are two public elementary schools in Laguitas administered by the Department of Education through the Division of Malaybalay City. These are Laguitas Elementary School in the village proper; the other is Balangbang Elementary School in Balangbang  History  A popular historical narrative about the establishment of Laguitas is centered around a legendary maiden named \\"Quitas,\\" who was usually seen during a full moon sitting at a big flat sardonyx stone beside a balete tree along the Sawaga. Quitas was described as a beautiful youth with long, black hair running to her waist and enveloped with fragrance. She was also described as interacting with wildlife as if she were talking to them, leading to the villagers to believe that she was a fairy or a diwata. When Spanish colonizers heard of the story, the place around her purported sanctuary including the nearby settlement was called Laguitas. Nonetheless, Laguitas was an old settlement and had an organized administration as a barrio of Malaybalay. In 1972, Sitio Sinakuruwan to the north was separated from Laguitas to become a regular barangay under the name San Jose. Sharing the vicissitudes of its mother town and the Philippines as a whole, Laguitas grew into this present, developing community in the southern part of the city.

Members of this gens first appear in the time of the Republic, but few are mentioned by ancient writers. Others are known from inscriptions. The Suellii are easily confused with the Suilii, although there is a possibility that the two gentes were in fact identical. The most illustrious of this family was probably Gnaeus Suellius Rufus Marcianus, who was consul during the reign of Commodus. Origin The nomen Suellius appears to belong to a class of gentilicia typically formed from cognomina with diminutive endings, such as ', or the double diminutive ', but occasionally formed directly from surnames without these endings.Chase, pp. 122‚Äì124. The greater number of Suellii mentioned in inscriptions came from Samnium, strongly indicating that this gens was of Samnite origin. Praenomina The Suellii used a variety of common praenomina, chiefly Marcus, Gnaeus, and Gaius. One of the earlier inscriptions provides an example of the relatively distinctive praenomen Vibius, which was relatively uncommon at Rome, although more abundant in the countryside. Branches and cognomina Most of the Suellii known from epigraphy lived during imperial times, when the surnames assumed by the Roman nobility were highly changeable, but a distinct family of the Suellii at Ligures Baebiani, where they bore the cognomina Flaccus and Rufus. Both of these belonged to an abundant type of cognomen derived from the physical features of individuals, with Flaccus designating someone flabby, or with large or floppy ears, while Rufus, \\"reddish\\", usually referred to someone with red hair.Chase, pp. 109, 110.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s.v. flaccus.

Her mother, the daughter of Vanessa Bell and the painter Duncan Grant, and a niece of the writer Virginia Woolf, was an artist.Frances Spalding, \\"Angelica Garnett obituary\\" in The Guardian, 7 May 2012 The four sisters had an unconventional childhood. Growing up at Hilton Hall, near St Ives in Huntingdonshire, Henrietta and her sisters Amaryllis, Nerissa, and Fanny were all sent to the co-educational Huntingdon Grammar School. They took leading parts in school plays and were creative. At home, they had a farm, with cows, an orchard, a swimming pool, and sculptures.Frances Spalding, Duncan Grant (Chatto & Windus, 1997), pp. 210-215 Garnett also spent holidays at her grandparents' Charleston Farmhouse, sometimes sitting for its painters. She later wrote of Charleston \\"It was an extraordinary treasure chest overflowing with familiar curiosities, beauty, ideas, people and jokes.\\" She later claimed that after the age of ten she had always been in love. She wanted to become an actress and blamed her failure to do so on a lack of formal education and mental discipline.Virginia Nicholson, \\"HENRIETTA GARNETT (1945-2019) A message from Virginia Nicholson, President of The Charleston Trust\\" at charleston.org.uk, accessed 29 May 2020 In 1962, aged only seventeen and already pregnant, Henrietta married Burgo Partridge.Mary Ann Caws, Sarah Bird Wright, Bloomsbury and France: art and friends (Oxford University Press, 2000, ), p. 386 Ten years older than her, he was the son of Ralph and Frances Partridge. His mother's sister, Ray Marshall, had been the first wife of Henrietta's father, David Garnett. Burgo Partridge died suddenly of heart failure on 7 September 1963, three weeks after the birth of their daughter Sophie Vanessa, leaving his wife a widow at the age of eighteen.Adam Kuper, Incest & influence: the private life of bourgeois England (Harvard University Press, 2009, ), p. 242 Career Now a single mother, Henrietta was swept into the hedonistic life of the swinging Sixties. After a time of nightclubs in Marbella, she joined a group led by Mark Palmer that travelled around England in a convoy of horse-drawn caravans, in support of love and peace, a group later called by Garnett \\"chequebook hippies\\". She had several boyfriends and married twice more, her second husband being an art dealer, John Couper, and her third John Baker, a writer she met on a train. This led to her appearing in a BBC television 40 Minutes programme on the topic of love at first sight. Garnett's cousin Virginia Nicholson later recalled that \\"Everything about her, from the overpowering scent of Guerlain's L'Heure Bleue over breakfast, to the limitless Gauloises habit; from her deft skill with rough-puff pastry, to her passion for the Victorian novel ‚Äì exuded fascination.\\" In 1977, Garnett threw herself off a hotel roof in London, a failed suicide attempt which left her with severe injuries. A few years later, she went to live with Mark Divall, a former gardener at Charleston, in Normandy, and later in Provence. Her only novel, Family Skeletons, was published in 1986. About early romance, its storyline included incest and suicide, and in the light of the author's Bloomsbury background, readers looked for parallels with real life. In 2001, she returned to live in England, acquiring a small house in Chelsea, and then a cottage in Sussex. In 2004, she published Anny: A Life of Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie, a biography of William Makepeace Thackeray's daughter Anne Ritchie, who was a sister-in-law of Henrietta Garnett's great-grandfather Leslie Stephen, converted into Mrs Hilberry in her great aunt Virginia Woolf's Night and Day.

It is a multi-component site with Prehistoric Upper Mississippian Oneota and Historic components. The site was occupied by Native Americans as late as the 1820s and 1830s, when the Winnebago tribe resided there. At that time, it was called ‚ÄúWhite Crow‚Äôs Village‚Äù after the name of the chief.  History of Archaeological Investigations  For many years Carcajou Point was known as a locality where Native American and early European antiquities were present. The archaeologist W.C. McKern referred to the Carcajou Village site on a list of uninvestigated sites in 1945. In 1957 the site was excavated under the auspices of the Wisconsin Archaeological Society, and in 1962 Robert Hall created a site report to discuss the findings and compare them to other Oneota sites in Wisconsin.  Results of Data Analysis  Excavations at the site yielded Prehistoric and Historic artifacts, house structures, pit features, burials, animal bone and plant remains. = Structures = Three types of house structures were identified at the site. The first is a mat- covered wigwam with pole frame-based foundation; this type was based on observation of circular placement of post-molds. The second type is a rectangular structure resembling a bark summer-house described from the early Historic period. The third is a square structure with wall-trench construction which resembles the house structures found in the Heally component of the Zimmerman Site and the Middle Mississippian Aztalan site about 13 miles north of Carcajou Point. This type is associated with radiocarbon dates of A.D. 998 and A.D. 1028 at Carcajou Point. = Features = 79 pit features were excavated in the 1957 fieldwork. Hall‚Äôs report did not provide a typology of feature types but it was implied that the main type was refuse pits. The refuse pits at Carcajou Point were thought to have started out as storage pits constructed to store food for later consumption; which were converted to refuse pits as their contents soured. = Burials = Three burials were excavated representing both primary and secondary (ie ‚Äúbundle‚Äù) interments. The first was a fragmentary burial found in a basin-shaped pit with no grave goods. The second was a bundle burial with 6 individuals and grave goods consisting of pottery vessels and an arrowshaft straightener. The third was a primary interment of an infant in a refuse pit. = Animal Remains = A full listing of animal remains was not provided in the site report, but deer, elk, bison and turtle are mentioned specifically, with deer identified as the dietary staple. = Plant Remains = Very few plant remains were recovered during excavations, because of the fact that flotation techniques were not yet in widespread use among archaeologists. One kernel of maize was recovered from feature contexts, along with charred seeds which were not identified. = Artifacts = Pottery Artifacts  Archaeologists often find pottery to be a very useful tool in analyzing a prehistoric culture. It is usually very plentiful at a site and the details of manufacture and decoration are very sensitive indicators of time, space and culture. 3,685 sherds and one complete vessel were recovered in the 1957 excavations. Of these, 48 were Late Woodland in affiliation, 39 came from miniature children‚Äôs vessels and the remaining 3,594 are from the Upper Mississippian Oneota component. Almost all of the Upper Mississippian Oneota sherds were shell-tempered with smooth surface. 14 sherds were cordmarked, 3 sherds were observed to have traces of red paint, and 3 sherds had black paint. During the artifact analysis, sherds were categorized into 27 different groups, but only 7 of these groups are actually recognized pottery types. The remainder are mostly body sherds which did not have enough information to be assigned to a definite type. The following types were identified or created to classify the pottery at Carcajou Point: * Carcajou Curvilinear - based on 11 vessels from Carcajou Point and 2 vessels from the Walker-Hooper Site, located in Green Lake County, Wisconsin. Consists of shell-tempered, globular jars with restricted orifice, well-defined shoulders, everted rim profile and notched lips. Surface finish is smooth and decoration is applied between the neck and shoulder in the form of interlocking scrolls sometimes with hatched areas, and meanders. Occasionally handles are present. Early examples have angular shoulders. Grand River Trailed is similar except for the notched lips. ** Time Period : Prehistoric to Protohistoric/Early Historic. ** Prehistoric Cultural Affiliation : Upper Mississippian Oneota (Koshkonong and Grand River Foci). ** Protohistoric/Historic Cultural Affiliation: unknown, possibly Winnebago. * Carcajou Plain - based on 1 complete vessel and 9 rim sherds. Same as Carcajou Curvilinear except decoration is limited to lip notching, and some other vessel forms are present including small vertical-sided bowls and shallow pans. ** Time Period: Prehistoric to Protohistoric/Early Historic. ** Prehistoric Cultural Affiliation: Upper Mississippian Oneota (Koshkonong and Grand River Foci). ** Protohistoric/Historic Cultural Affiliation : unknown, possibly Winnebago. * Grand River Trailed - based on 4 vessels from Carcajou Point and 25 vessels from other Wisconsin sites. Consists of shell-tempered, globular jars with restricted orifice, well-defined shoulders and everted rim profile. Rims are not notched. Surface finish is smooth and decoration is applied between the neck and shoulder in the form of interlocking scrolls , meanders, linear and circular, crescent-shaped and similar elements arranged in patterns. Handles are rare. Carcajou Curvilinear is similar except for the notched lips. ** Time Period : Prehistoric to Protohistoric/Early Historic. ** Prehistoric Cultural Affiliation : Upper Mississippian Oneota (Koshkonong and Grand River Foci). ** Protohistoric/Historic Cultural Affiliation : unknown, possibly Winnebago. * Grand River Plain - based on 7 vessels from Carcajou Point and 36 vessels from other Wisconsin sites. Same as Grand River Trailed except no decoration. Bowl shapes are also present. ** Time Period: Prehistoric to Protohistoric/Early Historic. ** Prehistoric Cultural Affiliation : Upper Mississippian Oneota (Koshkonong and Grand River Foci). ** Protohistoric/Historic Cultural Affiliation : unknown, possibly Winnebago. * Koshkonong Bold - based on 6 vessels from Carcajou Point and other sites in Wisconsin. Consists of shell-tempered, globular jars with restricted orifice and everted rims. Lips are sometimes notched. Handles are rare. Decoration consists of wide-trailed (‚Äúfinger-trailed‚Äù) lines applied vertically or diagonally from the neck to shoulder. This type is associated with a radiocarbon date of A.D. 1528 at Carcajou Point. Finger-trailed vessels have been found at the Midway site in LaCrosse County, Wisconsin, as well as other Oneota sites, and in Huber Phase sites around the Chicago area. ** Time Period : Prehistoric to Protohistoric/Early Historic. ** Prehistoric Cultural Affiliation : Upper Mississippian Oneota (Koshkonong and Grand River Foci). ** Protohistoric/Historic Cultural Affiliation : unknown, possibly Winnebago. * Busseyville Grooved Paddle - based on 11 body sherds from the 1957 excavations at Carcajou Point as well as numerous body sherds in surface collections from Carcajou Point and other Wisconsin sites. Consists of shell-tempered, globular vessels with everted rim profile, squared lip and grooved-paddle impressed surface finish. Similar to Fort Ancient pottery from the Madisonville Focus and Danner Paddle-Impressed from the Danner Component of the Zimmerman site. ** Time Period : Early Historic. ** Cultural Affiliation : unknown. * Madison Cord-Impressed - based on 2 rim sherds. Grit-tempered vessels with cord- impressed surface finish, decorated by bands of cord impressions. ** Time Period : Prehistoric. ** Cultural Affiliation : Late Woodland.  Other Artifacts  Non-pottery artifacts recovered from the site included: * Chipped stone artifacts - including projectile points, scrapers and knives (subdivided into variants based on manufacturing technique), drills (subdivided into variants based on manufacturing technique) and percussion- flaked core tools. Of the projectile points, the most numerous category was the small triangular Madison point. * Ground stone artifacts - including arrowshaft straighteners, manos, hammerstones, celts, abraders and an adze. * Bone and antler artifacts - including beaver-tooth chisels, deer toe projectile points, beamers, awls (including ulna, metapoidial, scapula, spatulate, bird bone, flat splinter and spindle), a deer mandible sheller, a scapula scraper, bone ornaments, a roulette possibly made from a fish bone (a distinctive artifact also noted at the Zimmerman and Plum Island sites in Illinois), bone punches, antler punches, misc. antler point implements and misc. cut antler pieces. * Shell artifacts - including a notched shell and a pendant. * Copper - one awl * Pipes - micmac pipes, calumets and an equal-arm elbow pipe. * Pot sherd artifacts - there were several pottery discs formed by the working of a broken pot into disks. 15 discs were found with perforations in the center and were possibly used as a spindle whorl. One disk was notched, and 2 discs were plain. In addition, there was a potsherd fragment that was thought to be a clay scraping tool used in smoothing the surface of a pot prior to firing in the kiln. * European trade goods - including a glass bead, iron ax, iron awl, sheet brass fragments, a gunflint and brass wires. In addition, there were much more numerous artifacts collected on the surface prior to excavation by professional archaeologists. = Components = Carcajou Component (Oneota, Koshkonong Focus)  The Carcajou Component is the Prehistoric Upper Mississippian Oneota occupation present at Carcajou Point. The diagnostic artifact of this occupation is the Oneota shell-tempered pottery, which is decorated with curvilinear motifs suggestive of the pottery from the Middle Mississippian Aztalan and Cahokia sites. The timeframe of this occupation is radiocarbon-dated by 3 dates ranging from A.D. 998-A.D. 1528. Hall felt that this occupation was probably the ancestors of the Historic Winnebago tribe.  White Crow Component (Historic, Winnebago)  The White Crow component refers to the Historic Winnebago village that existed from approximately A.D. 1728-A.D. 1828. This component was separated from the Prehistoric component by approximately 200 years. It consists of several features with historic European trade goods in association with shell-tempered pottery.  Significance  The pottery at Carcajou Point helped to provide some detail to the Oneota cultural identity. The distinctive curvilinear decorations on the shell-tempered pottery indicated a clear influence to local Middle Mississippian sites and was used by Hall to define the Koshkonong Focus of the Oneota Aspect. The radiocarbon dates obtained from the site were the first in the region, and helped archaeologists provide a chronology for the Oneota culture.

After three years of study, Pomarat joined the permanent troupe at the National Theatre of Strasbourg in 1957 after being hired by Hubert Gignoux. Here, he acted in more than thirty plays. He also directed three shows and taught nearly 150 students during his time as a professor at the theatre's school. In 1974, Pomarat created the Maison des Arts et Loisirs (MAL) with support from Strasbourg Mayor Pierre Pflimlin and his cultural assistant Germain Muller. Pomarat allowed artistic exhibitions outside his theatre, with storytellers, circuses, and street theatres. He founded the Festival des Giboul√©es de la Marionnette in 1976, a festival of puppetry. In 1981, he established Compagnie du Th√©√¢tre du Jeune Public (TJP), combining it with the Maison des Arts et Loisirs, forming the MAL-TJP. In 1985, Pomarat and Fran√ßois Lazaro created a play based on Le L√©gende des si√®cles by Victor Hugo. The show won three awards at the Festival Off d'Avignon. He directed multiple shows at the MAL-TJP, such as Un pantalon pour mon √¢non (1977), Lorette (1981), and L'√éle des esclaves (1984). On his directing career, Pomarat stated \\"And then, I think I was running away from the staging. I had a fear, the fear of not succeeding, of bringing nothing ... You know, I am above all an actor. I like to deliver myself, in the hands of a director!\\". After imploring the Mayor of Strasbourg in 1978, the TJP was certified by the National Dramatic Center for Children and Youth (CDNEJ), after a notification from French Minister of Culture Jack Lang on 12 November 1990. Gr√©goire Callies replaced Pomarat at the TJP in 1997, and he once again became an actor. Julie Brochen, director of the National Theatre of Strasbourg from 2008 to 2014, casted Pomarat in several roles in The Cherry Orchard, Don Juan, Liquidation, and Pulcinella. =Private Life= Pomarat married Jacqueline Worms with whom he had three children: Sophie (born 1957), Simon (1959), and Virginie (born 1961). He died on 30 April 2020 in Strasbourg at the age of 89.

Gborogboro and Meme were a pair of twins created by the supreme god Adroa. The twins were created and lived in a place called Loloi, which was located near Juba in modern-day Sudan. Gborogboro was associated with the heavens while Meme was associated with the earth. Wild animals were said to be born from Meme's womb, with a gazelle bursting out of her womb fist, followed by the other animals. The twins married each other and produced another set of boy- girl twins. The twins offspring then produced another set of boy-girl twins, and this iteration goes on for several generations, with the number of generations and their names differing between myths. In at least one version, the names of the generations are given as Arube and O'du, Jokodra and Lebenyeru, and Yeke and Angbau. The method of conception also differs. In some version, the baby was placed into Meme's womb by Adroa. In other versions, the twins performed sexual intercourse, or became pregnant through the pouring of goat's blood between the female's legs. Jaki and Dribidu Eventually, the hero-ancestors Jaki and Dribidu were produced by the last generation. The siblings could perform superhuman and magical feats. Dribidu ('The hairy one') was covered in hair, and he was also known as 'Banyale ('Eater of men') as he is known to eat his own children. He was ultimately exiled for his cannibalism, and died at Mount Eti, while Jaki died at Mount Liru. The siblings were involved in several fantastical myths, one of which involving them curing a woman with leprosy and then having sexual relations with her. This led to a dispute with the woman's kin, resulting in a war breaking out. The dispute was settled with a fine that was paid to her kin along with a dowry. This was said to be the origin of warfare and the practice of dowry. They wandered the plains producing children with different women, who would become the ancestors of the Lugbara people.

It concerns descriptive complexity theory, an area in which the expressibility of mathematical properties using different types of logic is shown to be equivalent to their computability in different types of resource-bounded models of computation. It was published in 1999 by Springer-Verlag in their book series Graduate Texts in Computer Science. Topics The book has 15 chapters, roughly grouped into five chapters on first-order logic, three on second-order logic, and seven independent chapters on advanced topics. The first two chapters provide background material in first-order logic (including first-order arithmetic, the BIT predicate, and the notion of a first-order query) and complexity theory (including formal languages, resource-bounded complexity classes, and complete problems). Chapter three begins the connection between logic and complexity, with a proof that the first-order-recognizable languages can be recognized in logarithmic space, and the construction of complete languages for logarithmic space, nondeterministic logarithmic space, and polynomial time. The fourth chapter concerns inductive definitions, fixed-point operators, and the characterization of polynomial time in terms of first-order logic with the least fixed-point operator. The part of the book on first-order topics ends with a chapter on logical characterizations of resource bounds for parallel random-access machines and circuit complexity. Chapter six introduces Ehrenfeucht‚ÄìFra√Øss√© games, a key tool for proving logical inexpressibility, and chapter seven introduces second-order logic. It includes Fagin's theorem characterizing nondeterministic polynomial time in terms of existential second-order logic, the Cook‚ÄìLevin theorem on the existence of NP-complete problems, and extensions of these results to the polynomial hierarchy. Chapter eight uses games to prove the inexpressibility of certain languages in second- order logic. Chapter nine concerns the complementation of languages and the transitive closure operator, including the Immerman‚ÄìSzelepcs√©nyi theorem that nondeterministic logarithmic space is closed under complementation. Chapter ten provides complete problems and a second-order logical characterization of polynomial space. Chapter eleven concerns uniformity in circuit complexity (the distinction between the existence of circuits for solving a problem, and their algorithmic constructibility), and chapter twelve concerns the role of ordering and counting predicates in logical characterizations of complexity classes. Chapter thirteen uses the switching lemma for lower bounds, and chapter fourteen concerns applications to databases and model checking. A final chapter outlines topics still in need of research in this area. Audience and reception The book is primarily aimed as a reference to researchers in this area, but it could also be used as the basis of a graduate course, and comes equipped with exercises for this purpose. Although it claims to be self-contained, reviewer W. Klonowski writes that its readers need to already understand both classical complexity and the basics of mathematical logic. Reviewer Anuj Dawar writes that some of the early promise of descriptive complexity has been dampened by its inability to bring logical tools to bear on the core problems of complexity theory, and by the need to add computation-like additions to logical languages in order to use them to characterize computation. Nevertheless, he writes, the book is useful as a way of introducing researchers to this line of research, and to a less heavily- explored way of approaching computational complexity.

Its geographic area of interest extends from Lower Plenty and Montmorency to Kangaroo Ground. It also maintains an interest in the former Shire of Eltham and holds memorabilia from the former Eltham Shire Council. It is located in the Shire of Nillumbik local government area. It also encourages conservation of significant places, spaces and documents for future generations. It is an affiliated member of the Royal Historical Society of Victoria and the Association of Eastern Historical Societies. It is an historical society managed by volunteers.  History  The Shire of Eltham Historical Society was established in 1967. Shire of Eltham Councillor Charis Pelling was its first President. It was incorporated in 1988. Following the restructure of local government in Victoria in 1994, the Society changed its name to Eltham District Historical Society. Members have included the photographer Peter Bassett-Smith.  Local History Centre  The Society occupies the former historic Policeman‚Äôs residence in the Eltham Justice Precinct. at 728 Main Road, Eltham. It was constructed in 1859‚Äì60 in brick as a single-story residence consisting of five rooms. It has a projecting front room and timber verandah. It discontinued being a police residence in 1952 when the Shire of Eltham lands department used it as a local office. After that is was used by Council's parks and environment department. The building is registered on the Victorian Heritage Register. The detached weatherboard building situated beside the Local History Centre is a 1980s replica of the original police station which was located in the same position but later demolished. In 2019, the Society were able to take over use of the building for storage and for use as part of its education program. A historic portable lockup was moved to the site in March 2001. The former police quarters, together with rear brick stables and nearby courthouse form the Eltham Justice Precinct. In May 2020 Heritage Victoria recommended that the site be amended in the Victorian Heritage Register.  Collection  The Society maintains an extensive collection of local historical records including photographs, maps and historical documents. The Victorian Collections platform is used to manage its mainly paper-based collection, where information can be found on over 10,000 collection items.  Activities  The Society collects, shares and advocates for preserving local heritage in its locality. It participates in community displays. It has regularly contributed articles and provided expertise to the local media on subjects of local historical interest. The Society hosts public meetings for its members and visitors at which guest speakers present information and ideas that are relevant to the history of the Eltham. Regular historic walks are held four times a year. A newsletter is published six times a year. The Society was instrumental in gathering photographs and information and publishing Pioneers and Painters: One Hundred years of Eltham and its Shire by Alan Marshall in 1971. As part of Victoria‚Äôs 150th anniversary celebrations in November 1985, the Society planted a time capsule in the grounds of the Eltham Community and Reception Centre near the original location of the Eltham town centre. In 1988 the Society moved its records into the former Eltham Police residence of the Eltham Justice precinct and established the Local History Centre. In 1992 a sub-committee of the Society was formed that led to the independent establishment of the Andrew Ross Museum, Kangaroo Ground after the historical teacher's residence in the grounds of the Kangaroo Ground Primary School became available. In 1999 A Chronology of known local events 1838-1998 was published and donated to local schools and libraries. A third edition was published in 2002. The Tower of Remembrance and War Memorial Park on Garden Hill at Kangaroo Ground, Victoria was also first published in 2002 and updated in 2010. The Society participated in a program of events for Heritage Week in the Shire of Nillumbik with eight other historical societies in 2004. The Society is co-custodian of the Shire of Eltham Pioneers Photograph Collection in partnership with Yarra Plenty Regional Library. In 2013, the library was a recipient of a 2012-2013 Local History Grant to digitise and catalogue this collection. In 2015 a new website was launched. As a member of the Yarra Plenty Heritage Group, the Society contributed to the Looking Back, Looking Forward Exhibition which ran 5 December 2019 ‚Äì 6 January 2020. Images from the Society's collection are on Jigsaw Planet.  Awards and recognition  Committee of Management members have had their long term service recognised via the Royal Historical Society of Victoria annual awards of Merit recognition scheme including long time Secretary Russell Yeoman in 1998 and Presidents Sue Law in 2006, Harry Gilham in 2009 and Jim Connor in 2019. The Society's 50th anniversary in 2017 was acknowledged by Vicki Ward MP Member for Eltham in the Parliament of Victoria. The Society was awarded the Shire of Nillumbik Community Group of the Year on Australia Day January 26, 2018. Inaugural member Russell Yeoman was acknowledged for his 50 years service as Secretary by Vicki Ward MP Member for Eltham in the Parliament of Victoria in August 2019.

She and her husband, Nathaniel Starbuck, were the first couple to marry on Nantucket and were parents to the first child born on the island. She supported her husband's efforts to run a trading post, which grew into a large mercantile business with the advent of the whaling trade. Unusual for the time, she was a prominent leader in civic and religious matters. She had ten children and her family members were leaders in the Quaker meeting. Early life Born on February 20, 1645 in Haverhill, Massachusetts Bay Colony, Mary Coffin was the youngest daughter of Tristram Coffin (1605‚Äì1681) and Dionis Stevens (died after 1682). Her parents and her five older siblings emigrated from Brixton, England in 1642 to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. His two unmarried sisters and widowed mother came with them. The town on Nantucket Island, when it was still called Sherburne, in 1775 She moved with her family to Nantucket when she was about 15 years of age. Her father, called the \\"patriarch of Nantucket\\", was one of the original English proprietors of the settlement, and he was the island's first chief magistrate. With his sons, Tristram owned all of Tuckernuck Island and one quarter of Nantucket. Over the course of his life, he gave land to his children, including Mary and her husband after their marriage. She inherited her business and civil prowess from her father. She was baptized at Waiputequat or Waqutaquaib Pond by Peter Folger and had \\"radical religious leanings\\". Folger, a Baptist, was the maternal grandfather of Benjamin Franklin. Marriage and children In 1662, Mary Coffin was married at 17 years of age to Nathaniel Starbuck, son of one of the original Nantucket proprietors, Edward Starbuck and his wife, Katherine (Reynolds) Starbuck. Upon her marriage, she became Mary Starbuck. They were the first English couple to marry on Nantucket. Their first of ten children was the first white baby born on Nantucket. Their children were: Mary, Elizabeth, Nathaniel, Jethro, Barnabas, Eunice, Priscilla, Hepzibah, Ann, and Paul. The Starbucks had two and a half shares in the Nantucket settlement. She was the leader in the family; Her husband had legal issues early in their marriage and he could not read or write. They lived by Hummock Pond at Parliament House, so named for its large main room that was used for town and religious meetings and because a lot of public business was performed there. Colonial Nantucket Wampanoag traded with the Starbucks to purchase notions for making clothes. Nathaniel operated a trading post, bartering goods with the Wampanoag, and Mary performed the bookkeeping. Initially, Native people hunted birds and fished for their livelihood, and traded fish and bird feathers for goods. As the settlement of Europeans was established, Native Americans adopted the agricultural economy. The mercantile business expanded with the advent of the whaling industry and supplied residents with items such as candles, clothing, fabric, notions, molasses, and knives. The Starbuck business was likely at the south side of Main Street and warehouse was located southeast of the Main and Union Street intersection. During the Half-Share Revolt, she ensured that she and her husband supported her father and not Nathaniel's father, Edward Starbuck. During local meetings, she prefaced her comments with \\"My husband and I, having considered the subject,...\\". Her opinion was well-respected within the settlement. Known as \\"the great woman\\" or the \\"great May Starbuck\\", she was unique among women of her time and was a model to Nantucket of a stalwart person who embraced the Quaker religion, while also achieving success in business. Women in Nantucket were treated in many ways as equals. When their husbands left on whaling trips, women were responsible for the business that was conducted on the island. Quaker religion Nantucket Shearing Cart and Quakers, Nantucket, Massachusetts Like Quakers, Starbuck did not believe that services led by ministers and convinced her community members not to install a minister at Nantucket for many years. According to author Nathaniel Philbrick, \\"it was said that not of consequence was done on Nantucket without Mary's approval. Converted by Quaker missionary John Richardson and Thomas Story, Starbuck established the Quaker congregation in Nantucket, first meeting in her house beginning in 1701 or 1702. She became a member of the Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1704 and became a church leader and preacher. She was the first Quaker from Nantucket to preach on the island. As compared to other religions of the time, the Quaker religion was based upon members finding their own Inner Light (rather than relying on ministers to interpret scripture) and was favorable to women, who could write about religion, preach, or prosthelytize. She converted hundreds of people to the Society of Friends and the group established a meeting house on the island in 1708. Men and women from her family assumed leadership roles. According to Thomas Story, a noted Quaker, she was \\"in great reputation throughout the island for her knowledge in matters of religion, and an oracle among them on that account.\\" Death and legacy Starbuck died in late 1717, and she is buried at the Friends Burial Ground in Nantucket. Nathaniel died about one and a half years later, on the second day of the second month or June 6, 1719. Her family members became active members of the Society of Friends, continuing the faith for a total of 200 years. Lucretia Mott was one of her descendants.

He also wrote some now-forgotten historical novels, under the pseudonym \\"Bohemus\\".  Biography  His father, Johann Ferdinand Opiz (1741‚Äì1812), was a tax official who also worked as a writer and magazine editor, and carried on a correspondence with Giacomo Casanova.Briefwechsel mit J[ohann] F[erdinand] Opiz / Giacomo Casanova. Ed. from the handwriting of J. F. Opiz by Fr. Khol und Otto Pick, B. Harz, Berlin and Vienna 1922 His mother, Louise Philippine, was a great niece of the explorer, Engelbert Kaempfer. His brother was the botanist, Philipp Maximilian Opiz. The Glutton After completing his secondary education in Prague, he took a law degree, while studying drawing and painting in his spare time. In 1793, he continued those studies at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, where his primary instructor was Giovanni Battista Casanova, Giacomo's brother. In 1798, he made his living by painting the wealthy guests at the spa in Karlsbad. Around 1800, he was in Hamburg and Bremen then, from 1801 to 1803, in Vienna. It was there he created his Scenes from the Street and Folk Life of Franciscan Vienna (a reference to Emperor Francis I). Some of these were made into etchings by , among others, and established his reputation as a genre artist. His style was influenced by William Hogarth and Daniel Chodowiecki. In 1805, he and his wife settled in Leipzig, where he produced portrait miniatures. In 1814, following the War of the Sixth Coalition, he went to Paris to create and sell etchings related to the Coalition's victory. He apparently remained there until 1817, when he returned to Leipzig and created a series of etchings on life in Paris, published by F. A. Brockhaus. From 1818 to 1830, he worked as an engraver for the magazine Urania, also published by Brockhaus. Numerous erotic etchings have been attributed to him. His major publication, Character Scenes from Life in Paris, with twenty-four colored etchings, appeared in 1819. During the 1820s, he produced watercolors which suggest that he visited Russia and the Ottoman Empire. In the latter part of the 1820s, he became a Professor at the Hochschule f√ºr Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig. During this period, his well- known Leipziger Messe Scenes were published in Dresden.

It was the key element in confirming the decipherment of Old Persian cuneiform by Grotefend, through the reading of the hieroglyphic part by Champollion in 1823. It also confirmed the antiquity of phonetical hieroglyphs before the time of Alexander the Great, thus corroborating the phonetical decipherment of the names of ancient Egyptian pharaos. The vase was named after Anne Claude de Tubi√®res, count of Caylus, an early French collector, who had acquired the vase in the 18th century, between 1752 and 1765. It is now located in the Cabinet des M√©dailles, Paris (inv. 65.4695). Description The vase is made in alabaster, with a height of 29.2 cm, and a diameter of 16 cm. Several similar vase, probably made in Egypt in the name of Xerxes I, have since been found, such as the Jar of Xerxes I, found in the ruins of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. The quadrilingual inscription on the vase (transcription by Georges Albert Legrain). The vase has a quadri-lingual inscription, in Old Persian, Babylonian, and Elamite cuneiforms, and in Egyptian hieroglyphs. All three inscriptions have the same meaning \\"Xerxes : The Great King\\". The Old Persian cuneiform inscription in particular, comes first in the series of languages, and reads: The line in Egyptian hieroglyph has the same meaning, and critically uses the cartouche for the name of Xerxes. The vase remained undeciphered for a long time after its acquisition by Caylus, but Caylus had already announced in 1762, in his publication of the vase, that the inscription combined the Egyptian script with the cuneiform script found in the monuments of Persepolis. Upon Caylus's death in 1765, the vase was given to the Cabinet des M√©dailles collection in Paris. Contribution to the decipherment of cuneiformGrotefend hypothesis (1802-1815)= The early attempts at deciphering Old Persian cuneiform were made by M√ºnter and Grotefend by guesswork only, using Achaemenid cuneiform inscriptions found in Persepolis. In 1802, Friedrich M√ºnter realized that recurring groups of characters must be the word for ‚Äúking‚Äù (, now known to be pronounced x≈°ƒÅyaœëiya). Georg Friedrich Grotefend extended this work by realizing a king's name is often followed by ‚Äúgreat king, king of kings‚Äù and the name of the king's father.Kent, R. G.: \\"Old Persian: Grammar Texts Lexicon\\", page 10. American Oriental Society, 1950. This, related to the known chronology of the Achaemenid and the relative sizes of each royal names, allowed Grotefend to figure out the cuneiform characters that are part of Darius, Darius's father Hystaspes, and Darius's son Xerxes. Grotefend's contribution to Old Persian is unique in that he did not have comparisons between Old Persian and known languages, as opposed to the decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphics and the Rosetta Stone. All his decipherments were done by comparing the texts with known history. Grotefend presented his deductions in 1802, but they were dismissed by the Academic community, and denied publication. Grotefend has proposed a reading of the cuneiform inscriptions on the Caylus vase since 1805, translating it quite accurately as \\"Xerxes rex fortis\\" (\\"Xerxes, the Strong King\\", although it is actually \\"Xerxes, the Great King\\"). He was the first to make this suggestion. Caylus vase inscription according to Grotefend, with proposed translation \\"Xerxes, the strong King\\" (Xerxes rex fortis, column to the far right) now read \\"Xerxes, the Great King\\". Initially published in German in 1815. =Champollion decipherment and confirmation (1823)= Reading of \\"Xerxes\\" on the Caylus vase by Champollion, confirming the hypothesis of Grotefend. The vase, in a 1905 engraving It was only in 1823 that Grotefend's discovery was confirmed, when Champollion, who had just deciphered hieroglyphs, had the idea of trying to decrypt the quadrilingual hieroglyph- cuneiform inscription on a famous alabaster vase in the Cabinet des M√©dailles, the \\"Caylus vase\\". The Egyptian inscription on the vase turned out to be in the name of King Xerxes I, and the orientalist Antoine-Jean Saint-Martin, who accompanied Champollion, was able to confirm that the corresponding words in the cuneiform script (êéßêèÅêéπêé†êéºêèÅêé† êèê êèã êèê êé∫êèÄêéºêé£, X≈°ayƒÅr≈°ƒÅ : X≈† : vazraka, \\"Xerxes : The Great King\\") were indeed using the words which Grotefend had identified as meaning \\"king\\" and \\"Xerxes\\" through guesswork.Pages 10-14, note 1 on page 13 The findings were published by A.J. Saint-Martin in Extrait d'un m√©moire relatif aux antiques inscriptions de Pers√©polis lu √† l'Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres.In Journal asiatique II, 1823, PI. II, pp. 65‚Äî90 Saint-Martin attempted to define an Old Persian cuneiform alphabet, of which 10 letters were correct, on a total of 39 signs he had identified.

File:Saint-Martin Translation 1823.jpgOld Persian cuneiform translation by Saint-Martin, 1823. The Caylus vase was key in confirming the validity of the first decipherments of Old Persian cuneiform, and opened the door to the subsequent decipherment of all cuneiform inscriptions as far back as the oldest Akkadian and Sumerian inscriptions. In effect the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs was decisive in confirming the first steps of the decipherment of the cuneiform script. More advances were made on Grotefend's work and by 1847, most of the symbols were correctly identified. The decipherment of the Old Persian Cuneiform script was at the beginning of the decipherment of all the other cuneiform scripts, as various multi-lingual inscriptions between the various cuneiform scripts were obtained form archaeological discoveries. The decipherment of Old Persian was notably useful to the decipherment of Elamite, Babylonian and ultimately Akkadian (predecessor of Babylonian), through the multi-lingual Behistun Inscription. =Confirmation of the antiquity of phonetical hieroglyphs= Equivalence between the hieroglyph and cuneiform signs for \\"Xerxes\\", made by Champollion, in Tableau G√©n√©ral des signes et groupes hieroglyphiques. The cuneiform script is inverted. Champollion had been confronted to the doubts of various scholars regarding the existence of phonetical hieroglyphs before the time of the Greeks and the Romans in Egypt, especially since Champollion had only proved his phonetic system on the basis of the names of Greek and Roman rulers found in hieroglyphs on Egyptian monuments. Until his decipherment of the Caylus vase, he hadn't found any foreign names earlier than Alexander the Great that were transliterated through alphabetic hieroglyphs, which led to suspicions that they were invented at the time of the Greeks and Romans, and fostered doubts whether phonetical hieroglyphs could be applied to decipher the names of ancient Egyptian Pharaos. For the first time, here was a foreign name (\\"Xerxes the Great\\") transcribed phonetically with Egyptians hieroglyphs, already 150 years before Alexander the Great, thereby essentially proving Champollion's thesis. In his Pr√©cis du syst√®me hi√©roglyphique published in 1824, Champollion wrote of this discovery: \\"It has thus been proved that Egyptian hieroglyphs included phonetic signs, at least since 460 BCE\\". Similar jars A few similar alabaster jar exist, from the time of Darius I to Xerxes, and to some later Achaemenid rulers, especially Artaxerxes I.

Early years Walkinshaw Cowan was born on 25 December 1808 in Borrowstounness in Scotland. His father, Thomas Cowan, wanted him to become a merchant. He was indentured to Adam White & Co of Leith, served out four years and established his own business but this failed.Hendy Cowan: The Swan River Colony and the Cowan family‚Äù, Early Days: Journal of the Royal Western Australian Historical Society, Vol 12, issue 4 online Arrival in Western Australia Walkinshaw Cowan emigrated to the Swan River Colony on the ship Brothers, arriving on 1 January 1839.Rica Erickson: Dictionary of Western Australians Two days later, he and two fellow passengers borrowed some horses in Fremantle and rode to Perth.

Appointments  Cowan was appointed as private secretary to Western Australian Governor John Hutt. In April 1836, he was also appointed clerk of the councils, that is, the Legislative Council and the Executive Council. From 1846 to 1848, he would also serve as private secretary to Governors Andrew Clarke and Frederick Irwin. Marriage During this period, he lived with and then married Elizabeth Dyer (on 14 June 1842) with whom he would eventually have 11 children. He purchased land at the foot of Mt Eliza and borrowed ¬£300 to build a house. The property was well stocked with vines, bananas and other fruit trees. Inquirer, 11 December 1844, p.1. He contracted a painful eye disease ophthalmia and was concerned that he would become blind. Consequently he took leave of absence from October 1842 until December 1844. Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal, 29 October 1842, p.4. Steam milling adventure In 1843, he promoted the Guildford Steam Saw and Flour Mills, a business which ran a steam-driven sawmill and flour mill at Guildford, Inquirer, 25 October 1843, p.3. Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal, 4 November 1843, p.2. Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal, 4 May 1844, p.2.. In this venture, he was given technical sawmilling assistance from John Henry Monger Snr. Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal, 4 May 1844, p.2. However the venture failed. By late 1844 Cowan owed his bankers (George Leake and W B Andrews) a total of ¬£1,238 and he assigned all his property to them Inquirer, 18 June 1845, p.3., his house and land were sold, Inquirer, 11 December 1844, p.1. and Cowan returned to his duties as clerk of the Council Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal, 14 December 1844, p.4. and private secretary to the Governor. Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, 20 February 1847, p.2. A writ of fi fa was issued against him in June 1845. Inquirer, 18 June 1845, p.3. A meeting of creditors was called on 11 August 1849, and then a later meeting for a deed of composition. Inquirer, 22 August 1849, p.1.; 12 September 1849.p.1. Appointment to York In July 1847, Cowan was appointed as Resident for King George Sound Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal, 3 July 1847, p.2., however Cowan declined to accept the office because of \\"smallness of salary\\" Inquirer, 7 July 1847, p.2. Then after Charles Fitzgerald became governor, on 6 February 1848, he appointed Rivett Henry Bland, who had been Resident Magistrate in York and Beverley, as personal secretary and Clerk of the Council, and on 4 September 1848, WA Government Gazette 149, 5 September 1848. Cowan was appointed Guardian of Aborigines for York. He was also appointed as a Justice of the Peace. Inquirer, 6 September 1848, p.2. He was also in charge of the police. Cowan saw this appointment as a demotion. He was at one time disputing a directive from Government House and reminded the person with whom he was corresponding that had had at one he had ‚Äúserved immediately under the Governor of this Colony in a higher station than that of Guardian of Aborigines‚Äù. Cowan set off for York in a cart drawn by a team of bullocks. He was cautious of the aborigines on his trip to York: Cowan‚Äôs later recollection of York at that time was as follows: Guardian of Aborigines As Guardian of Aborigines, Cowan‚Äôs area of responsibility was large, stretching from Gingin in the north to Williams in the south. He had to make a trip on horseback in remote parts of the territory in order to discharge his duties. The position of Guardian of Aborigines consumed most of his energies. Cowan recollected about this work: It was dangerous work and several of the aborigines working with Cowan were murdered. Inquirer, 10 April 1850, p.3 and p.4; Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, 12 April 1850, p.2. Almost immediately, Cowan had a quarrel with John Drummond, who was the head of the Police in Toodyay. In 1849, Cowan accused Drummond of leaving his district while on duty. He publicly accused him of \\"disreputable, deceitful and disobedient conduct.\\" In April 1850, a court of inquiry was held at York to enquire into Cowan's complaints against Drummond. The court found Drummond guilty and suspended from duties for a month. In January 1850, Cowan produced his report as Guardian of Aborignes for 1849 and noted the \\"friendly feeling\\" that prevailed between the two races. He expressed concern with the increasing number of native dogs and commented in his conclusions: \\"I have still to regret that no means have been employed to teach of convert the natives in the District from their debasing superstitions.\\"CSR 2199/12, Cowan to Colonial Secretary; Annual Report 9 January 1850. Cowan was not slow to severely discipline aborigines. To the concern of the Governor, he sentenced a 15 year old aboriginal boy to two dozen lashes \\"for repeated neglect of duty and for taking on Tuesday last, his master [Mr Hoops]'s horse, to Northam remaining away two days instead of going to look for cattle in the bush as ordered and for abusing the said horse, which sentence I accordingly saw inflicted.\\"CSR 199/237, Cowan to Colonial Secretary, 28 October 1850.Rodger Jennings: Over The Hills, A History of York 1834-1880. In his report as Guardian of Aborigines for 1851, Cowan expressed the view that ‚Äúthe humane and kind treatment of the aborigines by the settlers of this colony has been the subject of congratulation in all the reports of the Protectors‚Äù. There was an absence of aggression and security for settlers on isolated properties. Cowan took an interest in the Gerald Mission, a mission and school being established by the Wesleyan Church for aboriginal children in York by John Smithies. The mission failed and Cowan blamed the loss of students from the mission school to \\"yearning\\" or \\"strong particularity\\" to their own districts, but also due to high death rates from influenza at the institution.CSR 230, Cowan to Colonial Secretary 3 March 1852. In his 1852 report, he refers to the Native police in York and Beverley as ‚Äúefficient‚Äù and goes on to say: In this report, Cowan also expressed concern for the effect of drunkenness and vice, and new diseases. Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, 13 February, 1852, p.2. One of the difficult duties Cowan had was to destroy native dogs.McLaren and William Coooper, Beverley, our Journey through time, Shire of Beverley, 2002, p.26. Historian John Deacon said of Cowan's time in office: Cowan‚Äôs respect for Cowits, Native Policeman John Drummond, head of Police in Toodyay conveyed a message to Cowan via an aboriginal boy called Cowits. Cowits was about 16 at the time. Inquirer and Commercial News, 2 September 1863, p.2; K. Epton: CC Hunt's 1864 Koolyanobbing Expedition, Hesperian Press, p.viii; Peter Cowan: A Colonial Experience: Swan River 1839‚Äì1888, From the Diary and Reports of Walkingshaw Cowan, Perth, Peter Cowan, 1978, pp.79‚Äì80. Cowan thought Cowits was very efficient and recommended that he be appointed as the first native assistant in York. Diary of Walkinshaw Cowan, quoted in Pamela Statham Drew and AM (Tony) Clack: York, Western Australia: A Documentary History, p.110 Cowan recorded in his diary and also wrote in 1868 about this: On 26 August 1850, Cowan wrote to the Governor on behalf of Cowits: CSO 1850 V199 202. Cowan did not receive a reply to his letter on behalf of Cowits and wrote again on 28 October 1851: Governor Fitzgerald responded: When Cowits died, Cowan said of him: Convict march on race day  Cowan‚Äôs duties as Justice of the Peace increased after the arrival of convicts in the York District in 1850. On a hot day in January 1851, about 20 convicts were working at the Cut Hill depot at the top of the hill on the Perth road, and these convicts knew that there was a race on in York. So 20 ‚Äúprobationary‚Äù convicts armed themselves with stakes and clubs (so no-one would stop them) and headed down the hill to the town to go to the races, preceded by one of their party blowing a horn. Walkinshaw Cowan, who was in charge of the police, only had two sergeants and three constables on duty. With the presumed assistance of the native police, he gathered 60 Noongar to guard the residents of the town. Cowan rode to the Stewards at the racetrack who suspended the races and joined Cowan to confront the convicts. When the convicts arrived at the town and asked the way to the race course, they were told by Cowan and the stewards that the race meeting had been postponed. Cowan advised them to return to their camp immediately and he would recommend that the incident be overlooked. The convicts decided not to confront Cowan and breach their probation and (except for two who were subsequently arrested) marched back up the hill to Cut Hill. The local Noongar had also armed themselves with good sticks ‚Äúin expectation of a good row‚Äù and were disappointed that this did not eventuate. The settlers raised 30 shillings for the aborigines and Cowan also rewarded them with a bag of flour. The Governor later heard of the story and awarded three more sacks of flour for the aboriginals. Inquirer 14 January 1852, p.3; 21 January 1852, p.3; Diary of Walkinshaw Cowan, quoted in Pamela Statham Drew and AM (Tony) Clack: York, Western Australia: A Documentary History, p.110. Fall from horse In September 1852, Cowan \\"met with a serious accident while kangaroo hunting.... His horse ran him against a blackboy and injured him so severely that he was conveyed to his residence in a senseless state\\". Inquirer, 29 September 1852, p.2. This occurred about 5 miles from York. He received several severe contusions about the shoulder and ribs. The \\"native who accompanied him\\" helped him reach a house where he was taken to York. Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, 1 October 1854, p.2. Farming at Mile Pool Cowan tried farming at Mile Pool, close to York. In August 1854, an arsonist lit and burnt Cowan's haystack of 3 tonnes at his home. Cowan pursued the man and caught him on the road to York. Inquirer, 30 August, 1854, pp.2 and 3. On 7 February 1858, the roof of Cowan's house was stripped in a \\"severe whirlwind storm\\" Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, 12 February 1858, p.3., and his gardens destroyed. Inquirer and Commercial News, 24 February, 1858, p.3. On 30 December 1858, Cowan's household was disturbed at midnight by a burglar. Patrick Mulligan was charged, put on trial in Perth, and sentenced to jail for 6 years. Inquirer and Commercial News, 13 April 1859, p.2. Cowan was active in the York Horticultural and Floricultural Society Inquirer and Commercial News, 5 October, 1859, p.2. and even won a prize for his grapes and nectarines. Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, 20 February 1857, p.3. In 1862, a bath was being prepared for his youngest child aged 2 years and 4 months. The servant went out of the room to get some hot water, and in her absence, the child crawled into the tub in which it was to be washed. The servant returned and, the room being dark, she threw the hot water into the tub and the child was scalded and died. Inquirer and Commercial News, 9 April 1862, p.2; 23 April, 1862, p.3. Cowan's farming venture failed and he was forced to sell the property to pay his debts. The farm was advertised in April 1867 as having \\"100 acres of superior Land. About 76 acres are cleared and fenced, with a frontage of a number of fine town allotments, and a splendid pool of fresh water. ALSO, Two Dwelling Houses containing 8 Rooms, an out-door Kitchen, Store, Stable, Stockyard and Hay-yard well fenced in, Pigstyes, 1 ¬Ω acres of garden well-stocked with vines and splendid fruit trees, and slabbed; Flower and Kitchen Garden fenced and slabbed.\\" Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, 12 April 1867, p.1. Appointment as Resident Magistrate  For many years, Cowan had been carrying out many of the duties of Resident Magistrate and was expected to replace Captain Meares when he retired in 1857. Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, 25 December 1857, p.2.Inquirer and Commercial News, 6 January 1858, p.2. Instead, an Acting Resident Magistrate was appointed (Lewis J Bayly) whom for a while, Cowan represented in his absence, Inquirer and Commercial News, 31 March 1858, p.2 and then when Bayly took office, Cowan appears to have attended or also done everything that Bayly did. e.g. Inquirer and Commercial News, 2 November 1859, p.2. Governor Kennedy explained that the failure to appoint Cowan was due to his lack of good health. Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, 1 January 1858, p.2.Inquirer and Commercial News, 31 March 1858, p.2 In July 1863, Bayly was reassigned elsewhere and Cowan was appointed Resident Magistrate of York and Beverley, but on the same salary he was receiving as Guardian of Aborigines. Inquirer and Commercial News, 22 July 1863, p.2. The Perth Gazette wrote: \\"as to the benefit likely to be derived from this change, public opinion is considerably divided - of two evils, choose the least, would express some parties opinion fairly.\\" Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, 31 July 1863, p.2. In September 1863, Cowan accused Fr Francisco Salvado (not related to Bishop Rosendo Salvado)), the local Catholic priest in York, of having an involvement with a young woman who was his housekeeper. Salvado defended himself but was stood down and forced to return to Spain.AM (Tony) Clack, Glorious Apostle, A History of the Catholic Church in York, St Patrick‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church, 2009, p.41. After several complaints to the Governor about the lack of suitable official accommodation for himself and his family, Cowan moved from his property at Mile Pool to a cottage on the east side of the Avon River, previously occupied by the medical officer attached to the Depot Hospital, Dr Robert McCoy. The cottage was gradually extended to accommodate his large family and is now the building known as the Residency Museum. Disputes with William Marwick and Edward Millett Cowan kept pigs at his home which frequently wandered to William Marwick's wheat stack. Marwick could not seek the assistance of the pound- keeper because he was James Cowan, Walkinshaw's son (born 1848), who Cowan had appointed pound-keeper, as well as Postmaster and Magistrate's clerk in 1864, when he was 16. In March 1866, Marwick impounded 8 pigs, but released them on Cowan saying that if he claimed damages from the pound-keeper, Cowan would pay. Marwick claimed damages but James Cowan, the pound-keeper did not recognise any damages and said Marwick should take the matter to the magistrate, who was of course Walkinshaw Cowan. Marwick resorted to writing to the paper, complaining about the situation and Cowan's 16 year old boy being appointed pound-keeper. Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News, 30 March 1866, p.2. The Rev Edward Millett, the Anglican Chaplain in York, had an unfortunate disorder called tic doloreux. This disorder causes a severe stabbing to one side of the face and is extremely painful. To cope with the pain, the Rev Millett took opium. He did this quite openly and all his congregation were aware of this. Walkinshaw Cowan appears to have unfortunately never understood the problems Millett had and concluded that Millett was perpetually drunk. Cowan accused Millett of ‚Äúdrunkenness, laziness, general moral delinquency and a diminished sense of responsibility‚Äù. Millett was outraged by these allegations being made against him. The Anglican Bishop, the Principal Medical Officer in Perth and Perth Police Magistrate all came to York to inquire into the matter. They concluded that there was no evidence that Millett drank alcohol and that any ‚Äústupefaction‚Äù was due to his taking opium because of his disorder. They noted that ‚Äúthe general feeling of people in the District (so far as was ascertained) appears to be one of respect and regard for Mr Millett‚Äù. They found that instead of him neglecting the sick as he had been charged, the contrary was shown. Retirement On 16 April 1870 there was a public meeting at the Mechanics Hall, York, to discuss representative government for Western Australia. Cowan, spoke not as the Government Resident, but as a \\"settler\\". He questioned whether meetings of such a nature should be held without being called through him, and then opposed representative government. Inquirer and Commercial News, 27 April 1870, p.3; Express 28 April, 1870, p.2; Herald 30 April, 1870, p.3. He was attacked by the Express for his position: Three weeks later a number of prominent citizens of York published an advertisement defending Cowan. Perth Gazette and Western Australian Times, 20 May 1870, p.2. In April 1871 there was another public gathering at the Castle Hotel to discuss land regulations. Cowan chose the occasion to urge the growing of vegetables. Perth Gazette and Western Australian Times, 7 April 1871, p.3. In 1876, Cowan was reported as unwell, Herald 4 March, 1876, p.3. and in 1877, there were rumours that Cowan was proposing to retire as Resident Magistrate. The Inquirer and Commercial News wrote: \\"I was surprised to learn this morning among the queries from York in your Friday's contemporary that there is a probability of our R.M. retiring from the York Bench. Surely this is not true! York would be up in arms at the bare idea of sustaining such a loss. Oh dear! What weeping and wailing there will be if dear Mr. Cowan departs from among us.\\" Inquirer and Commercial News, 26 September, 1877, p.1.also see Eastern Districts Chronicle, 29 December 1877, p.2; Western Australian Times, 4 January, 1878, p.2; 22 January 1878, p.2.

Cowan was reported to be in a \\"feeble\\" state in 1886 \\"and has been unable to attend to his magisterial duties\\" and \\"will be unable to do so for some time to come.\\" Eastern Districts Chronicle, 11 December 1886, p.2. Cowan retired, at the age of 78, in 1887. Other duties  Cowan was also secretary of the Government Grammar School (1846) and on the Board of Education from 1873 to 1888. Rica Erickson: Dictionary of Western Australians Death  Cowan died at Fremantle on 22 January 1888. He was survived by 15 children. Edith Cowan was the wife of his son James.

It is endemic to Australia, growing in all mainland states It is naturalised in Tasmania, over much of Africa, in Japan, and in Myanmar.  Description  Alternanthera nodiflora is an erect annual herb. The branches are almost without a covering but the nodes are covered with dense intertwined hairs, and there are two lines of hairs along the branches. The leaves, too, are almost without a covering and are linear, 2-8 cm long and have smooth margins. The inflorescences are globular, and often clustered. The fruit is less than half the length of the perianth. The style is very short.  Taxonomy and naming  It was first described by Robert Brown in 1810. The type specimen is BM001015779 (collected on the east coast of Australia); Isotypes are E00279928 (collected at Broadsound), P00622600 (all three collected by Brown). The name is accepted by the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria, by Plants of the World online, but is considered a synonym of Alternanthera sessilis by Catalogue of Life. The specific epithet, nodiflora, derives from the Latin, nodus,( \\"knot\\" or \\"node\\") and flos, floris (\\"flower\\") to give an adjective describing the plant as having flowers arranged in a knot-shaped inflorescence or flowering at the nodes.

History  Jubilee Hall, located on Shwedagon Pagoda Road in Dagon Township, was completed in 1897 to mark the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria, commemorating the 60th anniversary of her reign. The building had replaced a complex of assembly rooms used by the colonial administrative apparatus, first constructed in 1854. Throughout the colonial era, the site was managed by the Rangoon municipality, and used as an event and meeting space for high society in colonial Rangoon, including the inaugural convocation ceremony of Rangoon University. The building's well- appointed theatre had a capacity of 800 seats, with additional ballrooms to host clubs and cabarets. With the onset of World War II and Japanese occupation, the Ba Maw government renamed the building the \\"Great Burmese Royal Hall\\" (·Äô·Äü·Ä¨·Äó·Äô·Ä¨·Äõ·ÄØ·Ä∂·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏). In 1947, the building hosted the Anti-Fascist People‚Äôs Freedom League convention, during which Aung San drafted the Burma's first constitution. The following year, in 1948, the remains of Aung San and other government officials were laid in state at the hall for 6 months following their assassination at the Secretariat on 19 July, which is now observed as a national holiday, Burmese Martyrs' Day. After Burmese independence, Jubilee Hall came under the possession of the Ministry of Culture, and served as the site of the National Library of Burma and National Museum of Burma for a time, before becoming a cultural center and arts and music school.  Destruction and aftermath  Jubilee Hall emerged from a 1975 earthquake in Bagan relatively unscatched. Despite this, the Burmese socialist-era government demolished the building in 1985, ostensibly because of its significance as a legacy of the British colonial era. The Burmese armed forces subsequently opened the Defence Services Museum at the site on 24 March 1994. The museum was short-lived, demolished in 2017 in favor of a real estate development called Y Complex Project (YCP), to be developed on a plot. The project has been the subject of significant controversy, over lack of civilian oversight and financial transparency on a lease agreement between the Burmese military and the Yangon Technical and Trading Company, a subsidiary of Ayeyar Hinthar, which is a proxy of the Burmese military. The funds from the lease agreement flow straight into the military's Quartermaster General‚Äôs office, outside of civilian oversight. The project's international partner is a Japanese-led consortium, including Fujita Corporation, Tokyo Tatemono and the Japan Overseas Infrastructure Investment Corporation for Transport & Urban Development .

Baxter, Captain Thunderbolt and His Lady: the True Story of Bushrangers Frederick Ward and Mary Ann Bugg, Crows Nest, 2011. Biography All that is known about Winter comes from an article in the Monitor of 15 October 1827. In it, she is described as a bushranger and the lover (‚Äòdoxy‚Äô) of John Tennant. Her first name is not given and she is called 'Mrs Winter'. The Monitor reports two incidents from a period in Tennant's career when he appears to have spent time away from his gang. Tennant had been shot in July 1827 by James Farrell at an outstation on the Yass River.Sydney Gazette, 2 June 1828, p. 2; G. A. Mawer, ‚ÄòJohn Tennant: Terror of Argyle‚Äô, Canberra Historical Journal, vol. 13 (March) 1984, p. 2; B. Moore, Cotter Country: a History of the Early Settlers, Pastoral Holdings and Events in and Around the County of Cowley, NSW, Yamba, 1999, p. 144; D. Meyers (ed. K. Frawley), Lairds, Lags and Larrikins: an Early History of the Limestone Plains, Pearce, 2010, pp. 40-6. He was probably still recuperating from his wounds with Winter, at a camp somewhere near where Gundaroo is now located. During this period, Tennant's gang (including ‚ÄòDublin Jack‚Äô Rix, James Murphy and Thomas Cain) committed a robbery near Goulburn without him.J. McDonald, ‚ÄòWinter in Argyle: Unearthing Canberra‚Äôs Female Bushranger‚Äô, Canberra Historical Journal, vol. 84 (March) 2020, p. 12. The first episode reported in the Monitor is related to Tennant shooting an Aboriginal man in the groin. His victim managed to escape and sought justice from the colonial authorities. The new governor, Ralph Darling, had recently made a point of quashing the violence of the stockmen against Aboriginal people on the frontiers in late 1826 and the police were actively investigating all allegations, although few enquiries led to convictions.F. Watson, A Brief History of Canberra, the Capital City of Australia, Canberra, 1927, pp. 36-7; J. McDonald ‚ÄòWinter in Argyle: Unearthing Canberra‚Äôs Female Bushranger‚Äô, Canberra Historical Journal, vol. 84 (March) 2020, p. 12. Constable John Jones was dispatched to bring Tennant to justice. Jones engaged two unnamed Aboriginal trackers, who led Tennant to his camp, where Jones, in advance of his party, surprised Tennant and Winter as they were fishing on the Yass River. Tennant threatened Jones, who seems to have lost his nerve and allowed the fugitives to escape. Jones had only one eye and Tennant used this vulnerability to intimidate him, saying ‚Äòif you don‚Äôt lay down your musket, and go about your business, I‚Äôll instantly put out your remaining peeper.‚Äô Monitor, 15 October 1827, p. 8. The second known incident involving Mrs Winter is a robbery at a mill at an unknown location. It could have been one of either two of the outermost commercial mills at Minto or Windsor, or a small operation set up in an outbuilding at one of the larger pastoral stations in County Argyle.J. McDonald ‚ÄòWinter in Argyle: Unearthing Canberra‚Äôs Female Bushranger‚Äô, Canberra Historical Journal, vol. 84 (March) 2020, p. 13. Winter, armed with a ‚Äòvery clean brace of pistols‚Äô, entered a hut of seven workers and bailed them up while Tennant milled some flour. =The matching of Mrs Winter with Mary Herd= Mary Herd (occasionally spelt Hird or Heard) appears in the convict musters and transportation records of 1820, arriving on the Morley. She had been tried at the Old Bailey on a charge of possessing forged bank notes with 25 others. Herd was transported to Australia and sentenced to 14 years. Her court records say that she sometimes used the alias Davis and that this was her first conviction. Her age in 1820 was reported as 34 years.J. McDonald ‚ÄòWinter in Argyle: Unearthing Canberra‚Äôs Female Bushranger‚Äô, Canberra Historical Journal, vol. 84 (March) 2020, p. 12. On arrival in Sydney in August 1820, Herd was indentured to emancipist, Robert Winter (sometimes spelt Winters). He was working a small lease-holding on the Nepean River. They were soon married. In November 1826 the Winters and two others were arrested for the theft of bags of flour from the nearby Cranebrook homestead of entrepreneur, Samuel Terry. Robert Winter was sentenced to hang, but Mary was released on the grounds of 'insufficient evidence'.Sydney Gazette, 18 November 1826, p. 3; Australian, 18 November 1826, p. 3; and 22 November 1826, p. 3. As the Winters had been living on the bank of the Nepean, opposite Emu Plains, where Tennant was working in an iron gang, it is likely that they knew him. Tennant had absconded the month before their trial. It is believed that, after her release, Mary Winter ‚Äòbolted‚Äô and joined Tennant's gang, sometime before Tennant was shot by Farrell in July 1827.J. McDonald ‚ÄòWinter in Argyle: Unearthing Canberra‚Äôs Female Bushranger‚Äô, Canberra Historical Journal, vol. 84 (March) 2020, pp. 12-15. In 1827 she would have been aged about 41 years. Nothing more is known about Mary Winter and her identification as the Mrs Winter of Tennant's gang. She may have died, changed her identity, or found a quiet life on the frontier, undetected in the colonial records.

In 2002, P√©ter Gaszner, on the healing effectiveness of psychiatry, said: ‚ÄúIt is no coincidence that I was talking about asymptomatic and not healing. We can cure a disease for which we know for sure. Psychiatric treatments are not comparable to the effectiveness of treatments used in physical medicine. People's mental difficulties cannot be solved with chemicals. Drugs administered in psychiatry only serve to chemically suppress unpleasant mental manifestations, but this does not help the person to overcome their mental difficulty in the long run. It‚Äôs no coincidence that when medicated patients stop taking the drug, they ‚Äúrelapse‚Äù: their symptoms recur, which psychiatrists usually say, ‚Äúthey haven‚Äôt taken their medication long enough,‚Äù but in reality, these drugs don‚Äôt restore the drug. mental health and only suppress the symptoms for as long as they are taken.‚Äù √Ållampolg√°ri Bizotts√°g az Emberi Jogok√©rt.

Its fame reached the national level from the 1930s and, with the expansion of capoeira to other continents, it became international. Biography Besouro Mangang√° was the son of Maria Jos√© and Jo√£o Matos Pereira, born in 1895, and was murdered in the Maracangalha camp, a place that was immortalized by the lyrics of Dorival Caymmi, in the Santa Casa de Miseric√≥rdia of Santo Amaro where he died in 1924. [ 2 ] He was a native of the Bahian rec√¥ncavo and lived in that region, during a period when the sugarcane fields flourished in Santo Amaro , they played an important role in the productive scenario, through the sloops along the suba√© river they took the goods that went to and arrived at the pier in Salvador. Manoel Henrique, who, from an early age, learned the secrets of capoeira from Mestre Al√≠pio in Trapiche de Baixo, was baptized as Besouro Mangang√° because of the belief of many who said that when he got into some package and the number of enemies was too great, it was impossible to beat them, so he turned into a beetle and went flying. Several legends arose around Besouro to justify his deeds, the main one attributes to him the ‚Äúclosed body‚Äù and that bullets and daggers could not hurt him. Due to his supposed powers, the Beetle Mangang√° became a mythological character for capoeira practitioners, having their identity related to bullies, cappadocians, wobbly and rascals. It is speculated that he did not like the police and that he would have practiced several confrontations with the police forces, sometimes taking advantage of the clashes, however, according to Antonio Liberac Cardoso Sim√µes Pires [ 6 ] : ‚ÄúHis practices cannot be associated with banditry, because Beetle has always characterized himself as a worker throughout his life, never being arrested for theft, theft or ordinary criminal activity. His arrests were related to actions against the police , especially while he was in the army ‚Äù. Some historical documentation records the confrontations between Besouro Mangang√° and the police , such as what happened in 1918, in which Besouro would have gone to a police station in the neighborhood of S√£o Caetano , in Salvador , to recover a berimbau that belonged to his group. With the agent's refusal to return the seized object, Besouro went on the attack with the help of some companions. They were unable to recover the desired berimbau, as they were beaten by the police, who received help from a group of local residents: In popular culture A film adaptation of the story of Besouro, directed by Jo√£o Daniel Tikhomiroff, premiered in Brazil on October 30, 2009. Besouro was played by Ailton Carmo, and the fight choreography was handled by Huan-Chiu Ku, choreographer for the fight scenes in Kill Bill.

Bans can be enforced on figure skaters by the International Skating Union (ISU) and each country's individual skating federation. These bans can often be career ending due to the competitive nature of figure skating. A ban may be revoked if it can be proved that the skater tested positive for a prescribed medication. Some figure skaters will use PEDs to help with recovery time, allowing them to train harder and longer. Figure skating is an aesthetic sport that combines both athleticism and artistic licence, where weight-loss substances will have little effect on athletic performance but skaters may be perceived as more graceful and sleek, which is required for an athlete to be competitive.  History  PEDs such as meldonium, pseudoephedrine and torasemide have been used in the sport of figure skating. These drugs have little to do with building bulk muscle but can potentially be used to encourage a faster recovery, or diuretics may be used for weight loss. In terms of the technical complexity of figure skating, former American figure skater Scott Hamilton has stated that \\"It takes years to teach your body what it needs to do. Instant strength will hinder those efforts, not aid them.\\" According to Dr. Franklin Nelson, chairman of the medical advisers to the International Skating Union (ISU): \\"Most drugs that are apparently used in other sports just are not effective in figure skating...where you change direction, change speeds, do lifts, jumps and spins\\", a viewpoint shared by many coaches in the figure skating community. Figure skating requires lean figures from both men and women for both aesthetic and mechanical reasons, with an emphasis on achieving \\"a sleek, graceful bodily appearance while preserving the power, balance and flexibility a competitive athlete requires\\". This could lead one to focus on weight loss, maintaining a low BMI, and a host of other medical issues such as developing an eating disorder. Though there is a long history of illegal PEDs use documented for swimming and cycling but not in figure skating, but there continue to be individuals who will use illegal PEDs For example, the prolific use of illegal PEDs during the Tour de France by the most notable cyclist Lance Armstrong. The use of performance-enhancing drugs or PEDs such as steroids which boost muscle growth, narcotics to suppress pain, beta blockers to slow the heart rate. This can drastically improve an individual's athletic performance in these particular sports due to the specific physical demands in these sports. But compared to figure skating, the inherent complexity found in figure skating often discourages the use of illegal PEDs and the cost of being caught could be detrimental to their career. If caught in competition Nelson, an experienced Olympic judge, states that ‚Ä≥Our rules are 15 months for a first offence and life for any subsequent offence,‚Ä≥ ‚Ä≥The sanctions are so extreme that they would effectively end a career‚Ä≥. The nature of figure skater has one focused on their weight through controlling their diets to improve performance, opposed to using PEDs which could negatively impact their career due to the cost of being caught.  Countries  Russia = Ekaterina Bobrova (2010) In 2016, a former European ice dancing champion Ekaterina Bobrova failed a doping test as she tested positive for meldonium at the European Figure Skating Championship which is banned under WADA,, in turn, ruling her and her partner Dmitry Soloviev out of the 2016 World Figure Skating Championship. Meldonium has been used to treat chest pains though some state that it has the potential to increase fitness level according to the World Anti-Doping Agency‚Äôs banned list. Though this ban was overturned since there are was less than one microgram of meldonium and due to the uncertainties around how long it stays in the body. \\"Bobrova's suspension was subsequently lifted by the ISU, which stated it had decided \\"to stay the results management process and consequently not to disqualify any results at the present stage.\\" In 2000, Elena Berezhnaya, a pairs skater, tested positive for pseudoephedrine, which was stated that she had been taking cold medication to treat bronchitis approved by a doctor and hadn't informed the ISU, resulting in her 2000 European Figure Skating Championship gold medal being stripped. This resulted in three-month disqualification from the date of the test, thus the pair missed the World Championships that year as a result of the disqualification' Elizaveta Tuktamysheva at Worlds Figure Skating Championship (2015) Yuri Larionov a male pairs skater Junior World Championships and winner of the 2007 Junior Grand Prix finals paired with Vera Bazarova, was suspended for an anti-doping violation for 18 months (January 2008 to July 2009) for using Furosemide a powerful diuretic which the World Anti-Doping Agency classifies as ‚Äúmasking‚Äù anabolic and steroids. Yuri Larionov stated the use of the Furosemide was for weight loss but diuretics but it can be used as a masking agent for the use other substances, Though he claims that \\"during the month of December he had bought and then took a over- the-counter drug which behind his back contained a banned matter\\" Elizaveta Tuktamysheva, has publicly stated she has used meldonium before the ban but stopped when the ban was introduced in 2016. During the figure skating season 2014-15, she won the 2015 World Figure Skating Championship and many question whether this is related to her use of meldonium as she competed thirteen times that season. A well known figure skating coach Rafael Arutyunyan questions the use of PEDs and \\"whenever [an] athlete does that and says I‚Äôm dying, which is why I‚Äôm taking the pills, and then, she doesn‚Äôt die anymore, but the drug helps her to recover better, to train more, to add more power to his jumps\\". Though \\"some experts said that the evidence for such claims are scant and that it was not even clear if the drug improves athletic performance\\" In 2019, Alexandra Koshevaya was sanctioned for a two-year suspension (March 7, 2019 and ending on March 6, 2021) for testing positive for torasemide for violating anti-doping rules during the 2019 Winter Universiade in Krasnoyarsk by the ISU. She mistakenly had taken the medicine to reduce swelling (edema) in her foot and not consulted the detailed a sport doctor about the ingestion of torasemide. According to the ISU Disciplinary Commission the \\"Alleged Offender concluded by regretting what had happened and taking the obligation never to take any medicine without prior consultation with specialists again.\\" Laurine Lecavelier (2018) In 2019, Anastasia Shakun, an ice dancer with Daniil Ragimov, at the national level and a member of the Figure Skating Federation of Russia (FSFR). She received a one year ban( November 10, 2018 and ending on November 9, 2019) from the ISU, as she claims she mistakenly took furosemide during competition for an eye problem. She was \\"suspended from practices and participations in all competition\\", and explained she had taken furosemide at the advice of pharmacy before the competition to deal with eye swelling and \\"forgetting that it was on the Prohibited List\\" = France = Laurine Lecavelier is a single figure skater who tested positive in 2020 for cocaine at France's Master's de Patinage announced by the French Federation of Ice Sports. Thus, there is a risk of a four year suspension depending on whether it taken in or out of competition as if it was used for recreational purposes the penalty is less severe compared with the intention of performance enhancing. Kyoko Ina (2001) According to the ISU record, Christine Chiniard is a French ice dancer who was stripped of her third place medal at the 1983 World Junior Figure Skating Championships in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, after failing a dope test for a weight-loss drug for prescribed medication. Thus dropping to fourth place at the World Junior Figure Skating Championships. = United States = In 2002, Kyoko Ina, a three-time Olympic pairs skater, was suspended for four years because she refused to take a randomly unscheduled drug test at 10:30pm in July,. She was suspended by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) but not be the ISU as the test was a national out of competition test never face suspension. Since there was confusion about her retirement from amateur competition prior to testing as she announced he intended not to compete at the Olympics but no formal written notice to the USADA, she agreed to be suspended for two years without further appeal to the International Court of Arbitration for Sport . = Kazakhstan = Darya Sirotina was banned for one year from 17 January 2017 to 16 January 2018 by skaters who was subject to a period of Ineligibility following an Anti-Doping Rule Violation by the ISU. The specific substance used is unknown. = Hungary = Darja Beklemiscseva was a Russian-Hungarian pairs skater who skated with M√°rk Magyar. She was banned for two years from 1 December 2017 to 30 November 2019 by skaters who was who was subject to a period of Ineligibility following an Anti-Doping Rule Violation by the ISU. The specific substance used is unknown.  List of banned substances  There are four types of performance enhancing drugs in sport, this will include anabolic steroids, stimulants, human growth hormone and diuretics. This section will have a greater focus on specific illegal PEDs that have been used by previous figure skaters. = Meldonium = Example of meldonium in a capsule and injectable Meldonium (mildronate; 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium)propionate;) is a cardio-protective drug. Under the WADA banned list of substances, meldonium is an S4 substance. It is typically a drug that helps improve circulation to the brain and been used for heart conditions such as angina. This drug s produced in Latvia and most commonly used in northern Europe such as Eastern European Counties such as Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Azerbaijan, and Armenia and not currently approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in many countries of the European Union (EU). As stated in this BBC article, \\"It is produced out of Latvia, has been around for some time and is commonly used in northern Europe. In figure skating, meldonium may have the potential to improve endurance performance and encourage the use of hormones and stimulants, which could lead to misuse of meldonium as the sport requires strength, endurance and artistry. Meldonium could be exploited because of the utilisation of fatty acid when exercising, along with decreased production of lactate acid after exercise and improved storage of glycogen. This can benefit figure skaters (i.e Elizaveta Tuktamysheva and Ekaterina Bobrova) as they have a faster recovery time and are able to train at least 33 hours a week (27hrs on-ice training and 6hrs off-ice training) meaning figure skaters are able to train even longer and harder and recover faster. Illustrated by the potential effects for meldonium to improve performance in figure skating without building bulk from steroids. = Pseudoephedrine = Example of pseudoephedrine in capsule form of Sudafed where it contains 60 mg of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride. Pseudoephedrine (PSE), is a commonly used drug for nasal decongestants that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passage. It is mainly used to treat nasal and sinus congestion or congestion of the tubes that drain fluid from your inner ears, called the eustachian tubes. This drug has been banned by WADA as it is a stimulant and has the potential to enhance athletic performance Due to its similarity between the structure of ephedrine and other central nervous systems stimulants. In figure skating, as stated by Scott Hamilton that \\"stimulants were equally dangerous for a skater‚Äôs success. They could make you lose touch with the ice and ruin your concentration,‚Ä≥. Thus illustrates the possible negative impact of stimulants in figure skating. But the effect of pseudoephedrine continues to be debated due to the lack of high quality random controlled trial (RCT) which could determine the exact role of pseudoephedrine in the body and whether it should be banned by WADA. As stated by this study that a \\"higher does of PSE may be more beneficial than an inactive placebo or lower doses in enhancing athletic performances\\". With more research and understanding about the possible effects of this drugs, \\"Since PSE is present in over-the-counter decongestants such as Sudafed, changes may allow athletes(i.e Elena Berezhnaya) to take appropriate doses for symptomatic relief, while taking the necessary precautions to avoid doping allegations and harmful side effects\\". This illustrates the potential that possible athletes could misuse the drug as it is a nasal decongestants without the intention of performance enhancing. The chemical structure of torasemide = Torasemide = Torasemide, is a high ceiling loop diuretic with the ability to promote excretion of water, sodium and chloride. If it used as a medication it is used to treat \\"fluid overload due to heart failure, kidney disease, and liver disease and high blood pressure.\\" Torasemide is similar to furosemide (frusemide), but is twice as potent. As a diuretics it aims to increase the rate of urine and sodium excretion in the body. Though diuretics have no link with athletic performance but this is based on the interest of rapid weight loss but they can be used for one of two purposes. Firstly it has the ability to remove water from the body to meet the weight categories in certain sport events. Secondly, it can be used to mask the other doping agents by reducing the concentration of urine volume. WADA states \\"the use of diuretics is banned both in competition and out of competition and diuretics are routinely screened for by anti-doping laboratories\\". Athletes will use diuretics in aesthetic sports particularly in figure skating where weight and physical appearance are heavily emphasised in the sport, which could encourage the use of diuretics with the intention of weight loss to be competitive at an elite level. Though there are many individuals who will use torasemide as a way to deal with swelling or weight loss shown in cases like Anastasia Shakun, Alexandra Koshevaia and Yuri Larionov, but many question the real effectiveness of using torasemide or furosemide and other diuretics on athletic performance.

History  The team was originally founded in 1998 on the initiative of the provincial government and the provincial sports office, and enrolled in the then Chinese Women's Premier Football League managed to move from ninth place in 2001, and after being renamed the Women's Super League to fourth in 2005 , the second in 2008 and winning the championship in 2009. Between the seasons 2011 and 2014, the tournament was re-designated Women's National Football League, interrupting the promotion and relegation procedure to and from the cadet series due to the lack of available teams and players. In this period the team achieves the best result in 2012, ranking second behind the Dalian Shide champions by repeating the placements of the 2008 edition. Over the years, the team has provided the Chinese national team with more than one player, among whom the most representative are Song Xiaoli, Zhang Yanru, Weng Xinzhi, Zhou Gaoping and Ma Jun. In 2015, the Chinese Football Association decided to relaunch the tournament, returning to the Women's Super League designation by reconstituting a second affiliated division, the CWFL. In March 2016, Suning Commerce Group announced that it had acquired ownership of the team making it the women's section of Jiangsu Suning F.C. As part of improving its staff, the management of the company convinces Norwegian international Isabell Herlovsen as well as four-time champion of Norway with LSK Kvinner and top scorer of 2016 Toppserien, to move to Jiangsu Suning, joining the other foreigner of the team, the Brazilian Gabi Zanotti, an operation that proves to be positive by winning third place at the end of the 2017 season. the 2018 season enters into a contract with Malawian international Tabitha Chawinga taken this time from the Damallsvenskan and which despite being graduated top scorer of the 2017 Damallsvenskan with 26 goals to his credit, she couldn't avoid the relegation of Kvarnsvedens. With the new arrival, the company makes a further leap in quality, with Chawinga at the top of the ranking of the scorers already in the middle of the championship.

History  The French Navy started organising Escadre d'√©volution early in its existence. During the 17th century, Tourville conducted such exercises. The practice fell in disuse due to an era of wars and lack of credits. During the reign of Louis XVI, the Navy restored the practice under Duchaffault and Orvilliers. In 1772, Orvilliers was cruising off the shores of France for several weeks, with his flag on the 64-gun Alexandre. Duchaffault captained the 50-gun Fier, and the frigate Aurore was also part of the squadron. Minister Sartine then instituted such cruises as yearly events. In 1775, Guichen was conducting hiw own excercices from Brest with a 12-ship division comprising four frigates, five corvettes, a lugger and two cutters, and 1885 men, with his flag on the 36-gun frigate Terpsichore. On 8 September 1775, Guichen's training squadron appeared on the horizon and was in port a mere two hours later; the event shook Sartine, who remarked that the defences of Brest could never be manned in such a short time, and thus had to be reinforced and maintained at a constant state of readiness, even in peacetime. In 1776, Sartine increased the strength of the Escadre d'√©volution to 17 ships, including three ships of the line, seven frigates, five corvettes and two cutters. It was organising in three divisions, each under a Chef d'Escadre with his flag on a ship of the line: Du Chaffault, holding excercices from Brest with his flag on the 74-gun Zodiaque; Abon, on the 64-gun Provence; and Chartres, on the 64-gun Solitaire. From 10 May, the squadron conducted a four-month cruise between Ushant and Cape Finisterre, and with 3,705 men ‚Äî fewer than in wartime, but noticeably more than the normal peacetime complement. The frigate Diligente, under Lieutenant Amblimont, took part in the exercises. Training at sea resumed after the War of American Independence and the related Anglo-French War that ended in 1783. Notably, when Louis XVI visited Cherbourg naval base in April 1786 to mark the completion of a sea wall, the Escadre d'√©volution held a naval review and naumachia under Chef d'Escadre Albert de Rions, with his flag on the 74-gun Patriote. The French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars removed the opportunity to conduct training cruises for a whole era again. In the 1840s, the practice was reintroduced under the impulsion of such officers as Lalande.  See also  * The United States Navy had a Squadron of Evolution in the late 19th century.

The word corneal opacification literally means loss of normal transparency of cornea. The term corneal opacity is used particularly for the loss of transparency of cornea due to scarring. Transparency of the cornea is dependent on the uniform diameter and the regular spacing and arrangement of the collagen fibrils within the stroma. Alterations in the spacing of collagen fibrils in a variety of conditions including corneal edema, scars, and macular corneal dystrophy is clinically manifested as corneal opacity. The word 'Corneal blindness' is commonly used to describe blindness due to corneal opacity. Types Depending on the density, corneal opacity is graded as nebula, macula and leucoma. =Nebular corneal opacity= It is a faint opacity which results due to superficial scars involving Bowman's layer and superficial stroma. A nebular corneal opacity allows the details of the iris to be seen through the opacity. A thin, diffuse nebula covering the pupillary area interferes more with vision than a strictly localized dense leucoma, so long as the latter does not block the whole pupillary area. This is because the leucoma stops all the light which falls upon it, whereas the nebula refracts it irregularly, allowing many of the rays to fall upon the retina where they blur the image formed by the regularly refracted rays. =Macular corneal opacity= It is a semi-dense opacity produced when scarring involves about half the corneal stroma. =Leucomatous corneal opacity (leucoma simplex)= It is a dense white opacity which results due to scarring of more than half of the stroma * Adherent leucoma: It results when healing occurs after perforation of cornea with incarceration of iris. The iris is adherent to the back of a leucomatous cornea. One of the major complication of adherent leucoma is Secondary glaucoma * Corneoiridic scar: If iris tissue is incarcerated and incorporated within the scar tissue, as occurs in healing of a large sloughed corneal ulcer, it is called a corneoiridic scar. * Corneal facet: Sometimes the corneal surface is depressed at the site of healing (due to less fibrous tissue); such a scar is called facet. * Kerectasia: In this condition, corneal curvature is increased at the site of opacity (bulge due to weak scar). Presentation Signs and symptoms include the following: * Loss of vision or Blindness (when dense opacity covers the pupillary area) * Blurred vision (due to astigmatic effect and light scattering) * Glare =Complications= Congenital corneal opacity that affecting vision will cause amblyopia. That type of amblyopia is known as form-deprivation amblyopia (or amblyopia ex anopsia). =Secondary changes in corneal opacity= Secondary changes may be seen in long-standing cases include: hyaline degeneration, calcareous degeneration, pigmentation and atheromatous ulceration. Causes * Congenital opacities may occur as developmental anomalies or following birth trauma. Causes of congenital corneal opacities include sclerocornea, trauma, ulcer, mucopolysaccharidosis, Peter‚Äôs anomaly, congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy. * Ocular trauma * Corneal ulceration * Xerophthalmia, caused by Vitamin A deficiency * Trachoma * Onchocerciasis * Mucous membrane pemphigoid: Ocular form of mucous membrane pemphigoid may cause corneal opacity and loss of vision. Genetics Pediatric corneal opacities may be congenital or acquired. =Congenital Corneal Opacities= Congenital reasons for this condition include: * Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED): There are 2 forms of congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED). Commonest is an autosomal recessive form, which is present at birth, but nonprogressive. Nystagmus is seen in association with this form. Another is an autosomal dominant form that occurs within the first few years of life. This form is progressive, but nystagmus is not seen. Deafness and CHED are seen in Harboyan syndrome. The histologic findings are very similar to those seen in pseudophakic/ aphakic bullous keratopathy. The appearance of the cornea is similar to that in congenital glaucoma but without increased corneal diameter and elevated intraocular pressure. * Posterior Polymorphous Corneal Dystrophy (PPMD, PPCD): PPCD, also known as Schlichting dystrophy, is an autosomal dominant disorder of the corneal endothelium and Descemet‚Äôs membrane. It is usually present in the second or third decade of life. It has the same entity as the first form of CHED. Most cases of PPMD are asymptomatic, and these cases generally do not require treatment. PPMD patients with bilateral, corneal opacities that can affect vision, descemet‚Äôs membrane endothelial keratoplasty or penetrating keratoplasty are the treatments of choice to improve vision and to avoid amblyopia. * Congenital hereditary stromal dystrophy (CHSD): CHSD is also known as Congenital stromal corneal dystrophy or Congenital stromal dystrophy of the cornea. It is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the DCN gene. In this bilateral Snowflake, whitish opacities appear throughout the cornea. The stromal lamellae are abnormal and may be separated by amorphous deposits. Moderate to severe vision loss may occur due to corneal opacity. In case of severe vision loss, treatment of choice is penetrating keratoplasty. * Peters anomaly: Peters anomaly, also known as iridocorneal adhesions or keratolenticular adhesions, is a posterior corneal defect with an overlying stromal opacity, often accompanied by adherent iris strands (Peters anomaly type 1). The size and density of the opacity can range from a mild to dense central leukoma. * Congenital Anterior Staphyloma: Congenital anterior staphyloma is a rare form of anterior segment dysgenesis that shares similarities with Peters anomaly. It is characterized by an ectatic protrusion of a central opacified cornea lined by uveal tissue. The protrusion extends beyond the plane of the eyelid margins and it can be unilateral or bilateral. * Lattice Corneal Dystrophy: Lattice corneal dystrophy is an autosomal-dominant characterized by amyloid deposition in the corneal stroma. Due to deposits, lattice-like corneal opacities may occur in stroma. Three types of dystrophies are there, type 1, type 2 and type 3. Type 1 is also known as Biber-Haab-Dimmer corneal dystrophy, TGFBI type Lattice Dystrophy, or Classic Lattice Dystrophy. LCD type II is not included in corneal dystrophies. * Granular Corneal Dystrophy: Two types, Type 1 and Type 2 are there. Both have autosomal dominant inheritance. In Type 1, Discrete crumb-like opacities are seen in the central anterior stroma. Visual symptoms such as glare and photophobia may occur early in life. In Type 2, deposits begin to appear in early childhood or adolescence as tiny whitish dots in the anterior stroma. Larger stellate, ring, or snowflake opacities may occur in later stages. Decrease in vision starts earlier in type2 than type1. * Sclerocornea: Sclerocornea is a congenital disorder in which the cornea is opaque and resembles the sclera, making the limbus indistinct. The central cornea is clearer than the periphery. * Cystinosis: Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of cystine within the cell. Early deposition of cystine crystals in the cornea cause tinsel-like corneal opacities. * Ichthyosis: X-linked ichthyosis is a genetic skin disorder caused by the hereditary deficiency of the steroid sulfatase enzyme. Ocular manifestations of XLI include superficial or deep corneal opacities. * Trisomy 8 mosaicism (T8M): It is a rare chromosome disorder caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 8 in some cells of the body. Dense corneal opacities may occur in trisomy 8 mosaicism. * Farber's disease: Nodular corneal opacity may be seen in association with this rare autosomal recessive disease. =Acquired Pediatric Corneal Opacities= Acquired reasons for this condition include: * Traumatic: Traumatic breaks in Descemet membrane may cause corneal opacity. Injuries to Descemet membrane occur during delivery. Opacity is commonly unilateral. * Congenital or infantile glaucoma: In Congenital glaucoma, the cornea becomes edematous, cloudy, and enlarged. Treatment should be done to reduce Intraocular pressure. * Congenital corneal ulcers: Unilateral corneal opacity may occur in association with conjunctival injection and other signs of inflammation. * Mucopolysaccharidoses: The mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of inherited metabolic diseases caused by the absence or malfunctioning of certain enzymes the body needs to break down molecules called glycosaminoglycans. It is an autosomal recessive disorder. Sometimes, Corneal haze may be present in early life. Treatment options for significant opacities include penetrating keratoplasty and DALK. TreatmentKeratoplasty= Keratoplasty also known as corneal transplantation is the main treatment option for visual improvement in corneal opacity. In this, the opaque cornea is replaced with donor tissue. Depending on type and density of corneal opacity different types of keratoplasty may be used such as: * Penetrating keratoplasty: It is the traditional full thickness corneal transplant procedure, in which trephine (a circular cutting device) is used to cut opaque cornea, a similar-sized portion of the donor cornea is removed with a second trephine. The removed part of donor cornea is known as corneal button. The donor tissue is then sutured to the patient eye. Dense corneal opacity which occupies all the corneal layers may be treated with penetrating keratoplasty. * Superficial lamellar keratoplasty: Superficial lamellar keratoplasty is used to treat superficial corneal opacities, which occupies superficial one third part of stroma. In this technique, the opaque part of the cornea is removed and replaced with donor tissue, leaving healthy part of the cornea including deeper parts of stroma and endothelium. * Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty: DALK may be considered in deep opacities with normal endothelium and descemet's membrane. In this procedure, the anterior layers of cornea are removed and replaced with donor tissue, leaving the endothelial layer and the descemet's membrane in place. =Optical iridectomy= Optical iridectomy creates a clear entrance pupil, improving vision in patients with segmental corneal opacities. An area of clear peripheral cornea can produce retinal images compatible with good visual acuity. =Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK)= Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) is useful in superficial (nebular) corneal opacities. =Tattooing of scar= Keratopigmentation or corneal tattooing is a procedure used for centuries to improve the cosmetic appearance of corneal scars. Tattooing will not improve vision. For tattooing procedure Indian black ink, gold or platinum may be used. Techniques * Staining method: In this technique, tattoo ink is directly applied to anterior surface of cornea. Benefits of this procedure include fast procedure with uniform dye application. Risk of fading is a main drawback. * Femtosecond laser-assisted corneal tattooing: Femtosecond laser-assisted corneal tattooing is a new corneal tattooing technique, with many benefits. =Keratoprosthesis= Keratoprosthesis is a surgical procedure where damaged or opaque cornea is replaced with an artificial cornea. Artificial corneas currently in commercial use include Boston keratoprosthesis, Osteo-Odonto-Keratoprosthesis (OOKP), AlphaCor, KeraKlear Artificial Cornea etc. Epidemiology Corneal opacity is the 4th main cause of blindness globally (5.1%). Using the World Health Organization's (WHO; Geneva, Switzerland) blindness definition,1 45 million people worldwide are bilaterally blind, of which 6 to 8 million are blind due to corneal disease. In some African areas, nearly 90% of the total blindness is due to corneal pathology. =Europe= The prevalence of congenital corneal opacities (CCO) is estimated to be 3 in 100,000 newborns. This number increases to 6 in 100,000 if congenital glaucoma patients are included. A study of live births in Spain reported that corneal opacities accounted for 3.11% of congenital eye malformations (Bermejo et al, 1998). About 4% of keratoplasties done in the pediatric population in Denmark are due to congenital anomalies (Hovlykke et al, 2014). =India= In NPCB survey (2001-2002) Corneal opacity was the 6th major cause of blindness in India, which accounts for 0.9% of total blind population. In the RAAB (Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness) survey (2006-2007) Corneal opacity including Trachoma was mentioned as the second major cause of blindness, which accounts for 6.5% of total blindness.

It stems from systemic stereotypical beliefs (such as sexist or racist beliefs) that are held by the vast majority living in a society where stereotypes and discrimination are the norm (see institutionalized racism).Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., & Akert, R. M. (2010). Social Psychology (7th edition). New York: Pearson. Such discrimination is typically codified into the operating procedures, policies, laws, or objectives of such institutions. Members of minority groups such as populations of African descent in the U.S. are at a much higher risk of encountering these types of sociostructural disadvantage. Among the severe and long-lasting detrimental effects of institutionalized discrimination on affected populations are increased suicide rates, suppressed attainment of wealth and decreased access to health care. Examples Examples of institutionalized discrimination include laws and decisions that reflect racism, such as the Plessy vs. Ferguson U.S. Supreme Court case. The verdict of this case ruled in favor of separate but equal public facilities between African Americans and non-African Americans. This ruling was struck down by the Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court decision. Institutionalized discrimination often exists within the government, though it can also occur in any other type of social institution including religion, education and marriage. Achievement gaps in education may represent an example of institutionalized discrimination. Two recent studies aimed to explain the complications of assessing educational progress within the United States. One study focused on high school graduation rates, whereas the other study compared dropout rates in suburban and urban schools. By taking a closer look at statistics of test scores and academic achievement, researchers noticed that wealthy whites do better than blacks, poor whites, and Latinos. According to Star Parker, reporter of the Durham Herald Sun, graduation rates among whites and Asians are about 25 percent higher than those of blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians. This signifies that academic achievement is linked to socioeconomic status. Spillover effects Institutionalized discrimination also exists in institutions aside from the government such as religion, education, and marriage among many other. Routines that encourage the selection of one individual over another, for instance in an employment situation, is a form of institutionalized discrimination. The phenomenon occurs unintentionally at times. Thomas Shapiro‚Äôs The Hidden Cost of Being African American addresses many of the problems faced by African Americans in the United States and how their current social and economic situations compare to one another. These issues include the racial wealth gap between blacks and whites, assets, and education. Housing in the United States is valued differently based on the racial makeup of the neighborhood. There can be two identical houses in terms of amenities and size but the value of each house depends on the racial makeup of the people within the community. Tactics like blockbusting, a method where real estate agents survey white homeowners in an area can cause a shift in the composition of a neighborhood. Although the concept of blockbusting has been illegal since 1968 unintentional segregation continues to define neighborhoods today. Solutions The Cedar Grove Institute for Sustainable Communities has developed a plan to fight institutionalized discrimination in the Mebane, North Carolina area, and included minorities in local planning that have historically been excluded rendering them insufficient police and fire protection. Their land values are lower than others leading to zoning for schools and other related issues. As community boundaries are not visible, a mapping process from the Geographical Information System (GIS) divides it. It combines several types of information into a single picture. The base map is physical features (roads, city limits, county boundaries) onto which other variables (e.g. race, income, water service, etc.). If needed, the processing system can also show other types of economic variables to draw conclusions about the area. Once the individuals begin to understand this information and realize what is happening to them, they have the power to hold the government accountable and can fight back against the institutionalized discrimination.

Born into an historic noble family, he joined the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) as a second lieutenant in 1897. He served on the staff during the Second Boer War, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. During the First World War, he served again as a staff officer, reaching the temporary rank of brigadier general. After the war, Wake commanded the 4th battalion, KRRC, in British India, and was aide- de-camp to George V. He commanded the 12th Infantry Brigade and after his promotion to major general, the 46th (North Midland) Division. Wake retired from the army in 1937 but maintained links, being appointed colonel commandant of the KRRC, and later chairing the Northamptonshire Territorial Army Association. During the Second World War, he commanded the county's Local Defence Volunteers, and was colonel-commandant of the 1st battalion of the Northamptonshire Army Cadet Force. He also held non-military roles as a Deputy Lieutenant and High Sheriff of Northamptonshire. He had an interest in history, and was a member of the Northamptonshire Record Society, while he campaigned for the restoration of abandoned ironstone quarries in the county. Early life Hereward Wake was born in 1876, the eldest son of Sir Hereward Wake, 12th Baronet. The Wake family, owners of the manor of Courteenhall since 1672, claim descent from the Anglo-Saxon noble, Hereward the Wake, who led opposition in East Anglia to the 1066 Norman invasion. However, this may have been an attempt to improve the family's provenance in the 14th century, and it seems more likely the Wakes were descended from a 12th-century Norman immigrant. Hereward Wake inherited the baronetcy upon his father's death in 1916. Military career An officer and corporal of the King's Royal Rifle Corps c. 1895‚Äì1914 Wake attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and after graduating, he was appointed a second lieutenant in the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) on 17 March 1897. He was seconded to the staff on 13 March 1900, by which time he had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant. Wake served during the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902) and received the Distinguished Service Order in 1901 for his contributions. Wake was appointed to the supernumerary rank of captain before 6 December 1902 and was appointed adjutant on 27 June 1903. He was awarded the regimental rank of captain on 22 December 1908 at the same time he joined the Naval War Course for training. By 1914 Wake held the rank of major and, after the outbreak of the First World War, held a position at the War Office. He became a 2nd grade general staff officer on 1 February 1916, and a 1st grade staff officer on 1 March 1916, at which time he also received the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. Wake was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier-general in 1917. For his service during the war, Wake received the French Legion of Honour and the Order of the Crown of Italy in 1919. In addition, he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, with the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel. After the war he maintained a link with army veterans, from 1922 he was the first president of the Roade and Courteenhall Branch of The Royal British Legion and presented them with a wooden hut to host their meetings. Wake commanded 4th Battalion, KRRC in British India from 1920 to 1923, was appointed an aide-de- camp to George V on 5 December 1930, then promoted to major-general on 23 May 1932. He commanded the 12th Infantry Brigade until placed on half pay on 23 August 1932, returning to service on 1 April 1934 as commander of the Territorial Army's 46th (North Midland) Division. Retiring from the army on 11 February 1937, on 20 January 1938, he became colonel commandant of the KRRC, an honorary and ceremonial role. During the Second World War, Wake chaired the Northamptonshire Territorial Army Association and commanded the Northamptonshire Local Defence Volunteers. On 5 May 1942, he was the first Colonel-commandant of 1st battalion, Northamptonshire Army Cadet Force, now A Company, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland Army Cadet Force. He co- authored Swift and Bold, a history of the KRRC in the Second World War, published in 1949. Personal life and other interests Courteenhall House Wake married Margaret Winifred Benson, the daughter of banker and art collector Robin Benson, at St George's Hanover Square Church, Westminster, on 30 October 1912. The Wakes lived at the ancestral home, Courteenhall House. They had seven children, including Hereward Wake who also served in the KRRC, and inherited the baronetcy. One of their daughters, Diana Wake, was killed in a riding accident at Bicester Hunt Races on 11 March 1950. Wake was appointed as a deputy lieutenant for Northamptonshire on 29 July 1922. He was nominated for the position of High Sheriff of Northamptonshire in November 1925 and 1938, before holding the position in 1944. Wake had a keen interest in history and was an early member of the Northamptonshire Record Society, founded by his sister Joan Wake in 1920. During his time at the war department he recognised the historic importance of some of its buildings and was responsible for handing over the keep of Dover Castle, previously used as a rifle store and at risk of fire damage, to the Office of Works for preservation. Wake owned a 1599 painting of Drue Drury. Site of a former ironstone quarry, Slipton, Northamptonshire Wake also played a key role in highlighting the damage caused to Northamptonshire by ironstone workings. He chaired a sub-committee on the issue for the county's branch of the Country Landowners Association and was a member of the Northamptonshire County Planning Committee. Wake opposed the findings of the Kennet Committee which recommended against any action to restore the workings. He played a role in persuading government to pass an act, proposed by Hugh Dalton, to mandate the restoration of all current ironstone workings and several thousand acres of former workings. In later life he lived in Hampshire but continued to monitor the progress of restoration on visits to Northamptonshire. Wake died on 4 August 1963.

Born into an upper-middle-class family, and known by family and friends as ‚ÄúMil√∫‚Äù, S√° Teixeira was the daughter of Afonso Henriques Botelho de S√° Teixeira, a medical colonel. He was vehemently opposed to his daughter‚Äôs wish to fly a plane. Faced with the weakening of his daughter's health due to his opposition, he changed his mind and allowed her to continue with her plans and from that moment gave her his full support. Her instructor was Francisco Craveiro Lopes who went on to become the 12th President of the Portuguese Republic between 1951 and 1958. It is said that, impressed by the determination of S√° Teixeira to succeed, Lopes made every effort to ensure that she became qualified. On completion of her training, she obtained her pilot's license on December 6, 1928, flying a single-engined Caudron G.3 biplane, at the Escola Militar de Aeron√°utica situated near Sintra. For the final exams she flew in the presence of her father and of Carlos Bleck who, three years earlier, had been the first non-military pilot to be awarded a licence in Portugal. Bleck was representing the Aero-Club de Portugal, which had been founded in 1909. Also present were the Civil Governor of Lisbon and several air force officers. S√° Teixeira was formally awarded her wings at the Ninth Annual Meeting of the Aero-Club de Portugal. Her determination to achieve her goal drew her to the attention of the National Council of Portuguese Women (CNMP), which advocated for equal rights for women. Recognising that S√° Teixeira, although from a fairly wealthy family, did not have the resources to purchase her own plane, the founder and Chairperson of the CNMP, Adelaide Cabete, formed a committee to organise a fundraising campaign to purchase a de Havilland plane for S√° Teixeira‚Äôs use. Members of the committee included the writer and feminist, Maria O'Neill. Considerable publicity for the venture was achieved, both inside and outside Portugal, and S√° Teixeira became a focal point for the women‚Äôs movement, but the donations proved insufficient for purchase of a plane. Public reaction to her achievement is said to have resulted in a positive step forward in the promotion of equality between men and women in Portugal. For almost two decades, S√° Teixeira was the only woman in Portugal authorized to fly a plane. It took another 19 years for Maria Ghira to officially obtain the wings of a civilian pilot. Only in 1994 did Paula Costa become the first woman to fly for the Portuguese Air Force. Maria de Lourdes Braga de S√° Teixeira flew relatively little after qualifying. She died at the age of 76, on July 19, 1984. To celebrate the 85th anniversary of her qualification the Lisbon City Council named a garden after her in the parish of Olivais (Jardim Maria de Lourdes S√° Teixeira) just to the east of Lisbon‚Äôs airport.

He was appointed to the position on April 17, 2020 by President Rodrigo Duterte and has not been confirmed by the Commission on Appointments. A former World Bank senior economist, he previously served as an undersecretary of the Department of Finance. Early life and education Chua was born to a Filipino-Chinese family on July 14, 1978. He was raised in Manila where he attended Xavier School in San Juan and graduated high school in 1996. While in high school, he participated in outreach programs in the Correctional Institution for Women, Payatas and Barasoain in San Juan where he also taught Catechism, English and mathematics to urban poor children. He attended the Ateneo de Manila University and earned a Bachelor of Science in Management Engineering in 2000. He later enrolled at the University of the Philippines Diliman, graduating from the U.P. School of Economics in 2003 with a Master of Economics. In 2011, Chua received Doctor of Philosophy in the same discipline also from U.P. where he served as research assistant to professors Solita Monsod, Felipe Medalla and Benjamin Diokno for a study on the country's slowing economy in 2005 which resulted in the implementation of an expanded value-added tax in the country. Career Chua started his career as a system analyst with Accenture (Andersen Consulting) from 2000 to 2002. In 2004, he started teaching mathematics and economics at his alma mater, Ateneo de Manila, a year after completing his M.Ec. at U.P. He was then hired as a research analyst for the World Bank Group in 2005 and resigned from his teaching job when he was promoted as its country economist for the Philippines in 2008. As an economist for World Bank, Chua spent a year and half in different places in Mindanao, including Marawi and Tawi-Tawi, where he led a team of researchers conducting a comprehensive jobs report on the impoverished island region. He served as a World Bank senior economist from 2012 until his resignation to join government service in September 2016. Chua was sworn in as Undersecretary for the Strategy, Economics and Results Group of the Department of Finance on September 29, 2016. As Finance undersecretary, he served as strategic adviser to Secretary Carlos Dominguez III and President Duterte's cabinet economic development cluster. In 2017, Chua was frequently seen participating in congressional deliberations on the administration's comprehensive tax reform bill which aimed to decrease personal income taxes and introduce higher consumption taxes to support the government's Build! Build! Build program. He was described as the \\"poster boy of tax reform\\" by several media outlets and was instrumental in the passage of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act (TRAIN) in December 2017. Chua also served as the administration's point person in Congress for its second tax reform agenda to lower corporate income taxes in the country in 2019. Initially named the Corporate Income Tax and Incentives Reform Act (CITIRA), the bill aimed to decrease corporate taxes from 30 to 20 percent to encourage job creation while transforming the incentive program into performance-based incentives. He is also credited for the passage of legislations increasing the sin tax on tobacco and alcohol products and introducing a sugary drink tax and excise taxes on electronic cigarettes and vapes to fund the Universal health care program signed into law in February 2019. On April 17, 2020, following President Duterte's acceptance of National Economic and Development Authority secretary Ernesto Pernia's resignation due to \\"personal reasons\\" and \\"differences in development philosophy\\" with some Cabinet members as the country battled the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, Chua was appointed as the agency's acting secretary. As socioeconomic secretary, Chua was tasked to formulate the country's economic recovery measures and a \\"new normal\\" plan following the financial shocks caused by the coronavirus crisis in the country. In May 2020, he reintroduced a modified corporate tax reform bill as one such measure under the post-COVID-19 Philippine Program for Recovery with Equity. Under the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act (CREATE) which replaced the earlier CITIRA, corporate income taxes will be reduced to 25 percent in the short term to spur economic activity in the aftermath of the pandemic. Chua also announced that the Balik Probinsya program or relocation of businesses and workers to provinces outside Metro Manila is included in the new tax incentives package, and that the government was considering levying taxes on digital goods and introducing a new sin tax as new revenue sources. He also announced the full implementation of the Philippine national identity cards as an agency priority. Personal life Chua is married to Alanna Chua, whom he met in 2001 through the Ateneo Christian Life Community, of which they were both members. They wed on November 28, 2009.

She was one of thirteen similar vessels, known to Sydney siders as the 'Hollywood Fleet'. Prior to the War, she was a private vessel built by W L Holmes launched in 1936. She was requisitioned and later commissioned by the RAN on 22 November 1941 under the command of Commissioned Warrant Officer Herbert S Anderson RANR(S). Lolita was armed with .303 Vickers machine guns fore and aft and depth charge racks on the stern. During the Battle of Sydney Harbour (often referred to as the Attack on Sydney Harbour) by the Imperial Japanese Navy on 31 May and 1 June 1942, Lolita was called to investigate an object inside the western end of the anti-submarine boom net. Having identified the object to be an enemy submarine, Anderson notified the Port War Signal Station that he had sighted the submarine and was attacking. Given the submarine was located between the boom net and the Western Pile Light, Anderson was unable to make a passing run to drop Lolita's depth charges. He therefore motored Lolita stern first to the submarine where he rolled a depth charge off the stern and sped away to avoid the explosion. However, there was no explosion. Realising the water was too shallow, members of the crew attached floats to the second depth charge to slow its rate of descent so as to trigger the fuse. Having done so, Anderson again manoeuvred Lolita stern first to the submarine and rolled the second depth charge into the water. Again there was no explosion. As they approached to drop the third depth charge, the submarine exploded showering debris over Lolita and picking her up on the wave from the explosion. Subsequent investigations confirmed the crew of the submarine had triggered a self-destruct charge which severed the bow of the submarine killing both crew members. Members of Lolita's crew were satisfied that as they approached to drop the third depth charge, the crew of the submarine knew they had been spotted and as the 'game was up', they destroyed their submarine in an attempt to also destroy Lolita. Following the destruction of the submarine, Lolita resumed patrols. Following the Battle of Sydney Harbour (often referred to as the Attack on Sydney Harbour), HMAS Lolita continued patrol duties at Sydney and Newcastle. In August 1944, Lolita received orders to proceed to New Guinea. Following the installation of new engines and fuel tanks to extend her range, Lolita proceeded north under tow by HMAS Yandra. Lolita finally arrived at Madang on 9 April 1945, with the intention to proceed further north to Wewak. Before doing so, she attended the repair base at Alexishafen for engine repairs and hull cleaning. However, on 13 June 1945, Lolita was destroyed at the repair base by a massive explosion within the engine room. The explosion caused the death of two naval personnel, William Bertalli and Alfred Smith and badly injured the commander Lieutenant Trim and another member of the crew. Despite Lolita's action during the Battle of Sydney Harbour causing the destruction of the enemy submarine at the boom net, HMAS Lolita, Anderson and his crew were not mentioned in Rear Admiral Muirhead-Gould's report of the Battle. Whilst a 'Pacific 1942' Battle Honour was awarded to her sister ships HMAS Seamist, HMAS Steady Hour and HMAS Yarroma for their roles in the Battle of Sydney Harbour, no such Battle Honour was awarded to Lolita.

Despite having joined the Communist Party in 1930, he was able to pursue his medical studies and career after 1933, becoming a military \\"staff doctor\\" when war broke out in 1939. Between 1944 and 1948 he was held as a prisoner of war by the Soviets. After that he was able to resume his medical career in the Soviet occupation zone / German Democratic Republic, achieving eminence both as a senior hospital physician and as a professor with the teaching chair in Psychiatry and Neurology at the prestigious Karl-Marx University (as it was known between 1953 and 1991) in Leipzig. Following a falling out with the authorities he relocated to the German Federal Republic (West Germany) in 1971, pursuing his clinical career in Essen, while in the short term retaining an academic strand to his work as a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania.  Life and works  Provenance and early years = Dietfried M√ºller-Hegemann was born in Laibach (as Ljubljana was known until) 1918), a multi-ethnic provincial capital within the Austro-Hungarian empire, much of which at that time was newly rebuilt following a major earthquake. In 1917, following the death of his father, the rest of the family relocated to Dresden. In 1927 M√ºller-Hegeman joined the Young Communists, remaining a member till 1933. In 1930 or 1931 he joined the Communist Party itself. It was also in 1930 that he became a medical student, studying between 1930 and 1935 at Munich, Vienna, K√∂nigsberg and Berlin. By 1935 Germany had been transformed, over just two years, into a one-party dictatorship. M√ºller- Hegeman joined the government backed \\"Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund\\" (NSDStB / \\" National Socialist...Students' Union\\"): he was a member till 1939. The Communist Party had been banned in 1933 and the ban was enthusiastically enforced by the security services. Nevertheless, according to at least one source, at the start of 1933 M√ºller-Hegeman became the leader of an anti-government resistance group which was \\"active\\" within the NSDStB applying \\"Trojan Horse tactics\\".Michael Gr√ºttner: Studenten im Dritten Reich. Sch√∂ningh, Paderborn 1995, , p. 452 ff. As with most \\"underground\\" anti- government activity during this period, ninety years later details remain sparse. Between 1936 and 1943 M√ºller-Hegeman was enrolled as a \\"training candidate\\" (\\"Ausbildingskandidat\\") at the Berlin-based German Institute for Psychological Research and Psychotherapy, an institution with its main focus on Psychoanalysis, then under the direction of the controversial Harald Schultz-Hencke. His own activities at the institute centred around psychoanalytical psychotherapy for Schizophrenia patients. In 1937 he transferred to Berlin's Charit√© (university hospital), employed as an assistant physician in the hospital's psychiatric clinic. It was here, still in 1937, that he received his doctorate in medicine in return for a piece of work on \\"An unusual array of symptoms of a commotion psychosis\\". = War years = In 1939 M√ºller-Hegemann enlisted as a \\"staff doctor\\". Between 1940 and 1941 he was posted to what became the Eastern Front, serving as a \\"military doctor\\". He subsequently returned to Berlin where he worked in an army hospital. He had retained his connections to the German Institute for Psychological Research and Psychotherapy, where during 1944 he delivered a series of lectures on psychotherapy for Schizophrenia patients. It was also in 1944 that he submitted his habilitation dissertation which under normal circumstances would have resulted in the award of a habilitation degree. However, his work triggered a serious and protracted disagreement with the institute director Harald Schultz-Hencke, who himself published a scholarly paper on the same topic at the same time. It is not clear whether it was the disagreement with Schultz-Hencke or the subsequent incarceration of M√ºller- Hegemann which meant that he only received his habilitation in 1951. It is also far from clear how M√ºller-Hegemann fell into Soviet captivity in 1944. He spent the period between 1944 and 1948 as a Soviet prisoner of war. His captors, if they did not know it already, quickly became aware of his political engagement before 1933 as a member of the Communist Party. According to information which he himself later provided to the university authorities at Leipzig, while in captivity he became the leader of an \\"antifascist committee\\" among his fellow detainees. One source refers to his having \\"gone through political training during his exile in Soviet Russia\\". = Soviet occupation zone (1945-1949) = In April 1946 a contentious political merger took place in the part of Germany that had been administered, since May 1945, as the Soviet occupation zone. Those who pushed the merger through may have intended that it should subsequently extend across all four of the military occupation zones into which the western two thirds of Germany had been divided, but that never happened. The most immediate effect of the merger was that the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party came together to form the Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands / SED). Following the \\"unification congress\\", thousands of Communist Party members (along with many Social Democrats) - primarily those who had ended up in the Soviet zone - hastened to sign their party membership across to the new party. Despite his being detained in the Soviet Union while all this was going on, Dietfried M√ºller-Hegemann was one of those who became a member of the SED during 1946. In what later became a country marked by an exceptionally politicised health system, M√ºller-Hegemann would be a conspicuously loyal party member for many of the next 25 years. It was only in 1948 that he was released by the Soviets, however, and was able to return to Berlin. Here he obtained official recognition as a Persecutee of the Nazi R√©gime (\\"Verfolgter des Naziregimes\\" / VdN), a badge of honour that would confer increasing kudos after the relaunch of the Soviet occupation zone in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (\\"East Germany\\").Richtlinien f√ºr die Anerkennung als Verfolgte des Naziregimes des Ministeriums f√ºr Arbeit und Gesundheitswesen der DDR vom 10. Februar 1950, Gesetzblatt der DDR, 1950, p. 92. = German Democratic Republic (1949-1990) = Back in Berlin, M√ºller- Hegemann discovered that he was a Pavolovian physiologist, and in December 1950 he became senior doctor (head of department) at the Psychiatric Clinic in Leipzig. By this point he had already been co-opted as a member of the \\"National Pavlov Commission\\". The next year he finally received his habilitation degree from the Charit√© (university hospital). The dissertation still concerned psychotherapy for Schizophrenia patients. It is not known whether the contents had been changed in response to the disagreements triggered when the work had been first submitted back in 1944. In Leipzig he was appointed to a position as Privatdozent at the university medical faculty, which he then held between 1951 and 1955 (when he received his professorship). Between 1951 and 1953 he held, in addition a post as chief doctor at the \\"Landesanstalt Leipzig/D√∂sen\\", as the \\"Park Clinic\\" was known at that time. It was here that in 1953 he established Leipzig's first Psychotherapy institution. Alongside his other appointments, between 1952 and 1957 he served as \\"kommissarischer Leiter\\" (head) of the Leipzig Psychiatric Clinic. In 1954 Dietfried M√ºller-Hegemann was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in bronze. Some felt that the East German honours system became devalued by overuse, but Patriotic Orders of Merit were introduced only in 1954, so at this stage M√ºller-Hegemann's award was still a rare honour. In 1955 he was appointed to a professorship at the university with a teaching contract. In 1957 a professorial teaching chair in Psychiatry at the university medical faculty was added, together with directorship (headship) of the Leipzig Psychiatric Clinic. He retained the university posts and directorship till 1964. It is apparent, at least for those making use of the access to records provided by the subsequent passing of half a century, that as early as 1960 M√ºller- Hegemann's high-flying medical-academic career at Leipzig was becoming less secure than professional comrades might have supposed. Security Service files that survive in the Stasi archives show that for several years there had been reports circulating within the agency that M√ºller-Hegemann might be regarded as \\"politically unreliable\\", a much used standard phrase in Stasi reports, and one open to a wide range of interpretations. It is not obvious whether these carefully filed reports were based on criticism passed on by professional rivals following disputes over Psychiatric theory and practice, or whether more politically influential sources were involved. It does appear that throughout the 1960s, within the Security Services, adverse reports of M√ºller- Hegemann's alleged \\"political unreliability\\" were not pursued with any great sense of urgency. Nevertheless, on 31 August 1964 M√ºller-Hegemann abruptly resigned from all his university and related posts \\"following an event with fatal consequences\\". It turns out that the ostensible trigger for M√ºller- Hegemann's sudden fall from favour was the deaths of two patients, respectively in 1960 and 1962. The deaths had been caused, it was alleged, by the administration of \\"obsolete psychotropic drugs\\" and application of Ivan Pavlov's (by this time officially discredited) views on hypnotherapy. Archival research subsequently undertaken indicates that the real problem was concerns on the part of certain elements lower down in the party hierarchy who felt that the Leipzig head of department was becoming \\"ideologically suspect\\". The \\"Karl Marx University\\" in Leipzig was a prestigious institution where the nation's elite students obtined their degrees. Security service officers and informers were particularly numerous and active in the region. He was cleared following an investigation by the state prosecutor, but his accusers had won their battle: there would be no return for Dietfried M√ºller-Hegemann to the stellar career he had been enjoying in Leipzig. He surfaced the next year in Berlin, where between 1965 and 1971 he headed up the Wilhelm Griesinger Psychiatric Hospital (\\"Psychiatrische Fachkrankenhaus ‚ÄûWilhelm Griesinger\\") in Berlin-Wuhlgarten, as Medical Director. One source describes the Griesinger as \\"East Berlin's largest psychiatric institution\\". In reality the new appointment nevertheless fell a long way short of rehabilitation, and M√ºller- Hegemann's criticism of the way government policy impacted people's psychological well-being was becoming ever less \\"coded\\", even if the full extent of his fall from grace only became apparent after his resignation. A special SED ideology conference was held in February 1971 at which the party ratcheted up its determination to bring East German psychiatric profession into line with the party's ideas (no doubt closely reflecting the ideas of the Soviet Communist Party) on Psychology. The reaction of East Germany's elite psychology establishment, whose presence at the conference had been mandated, fell short of uncritical endorsement. Three months later M√ºller-Hegemann was a delegate at a medical conference in Munich (in West Germany). He never returned to East Germany. In a letter dated 10 May 1971 and addressed to his former deputy at the Wilhelm Griesinger Psychiatric Hospital he wrote that he had decided to stay behind in the west only with a heavy heart. He explained that the authorities had blocked the publication of two books he had written in the last few years, and that his specialist research work had also been effectively blocked in other ways. The East German government reacted to the \\"defection\\" by revoking his official status as a VdN (victim of Nazi persecution). = Western man = For approximately a year during 1972/73 M√ºller-Hegemann was a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Although well known to psychology professionals in East Germany and, to a lesser extent, in other German-speaking countries, there were good career-related reasons for raising his professional profile more widely. In 1973 Dietfried published a short book entitled \\"Die Berliner Mauerkrankheit. Zur Soziogenese psychischer St√∂rungen\\" (\\"The Berlin Wall illness: societal origins of a psychic disorder\\") in which he put forward the thesis that a certain combination of psychological symptoms correlated with how close the sufferer lived to the Berlin Wall, the sudden erection of which in 1961 had been a particularly acute source of stress-shock for its nearer neighbours on the \\"eastern\\" side. The book only ran to slightly more than 100 pages, and was more concerned with diagnosis than with proposals for treatment or a cure. There were nevertheless indications that one start towards healing for those afflicted might be to find a way to escape from the east to the west. It was indeed a path along which M√ºller-Hegemann himself had already taken the most important step, and one that had since been followed by several more formerly senior members of the East German psychology establishment whose positions gave them access to the exceptional travel privileges needed for a trouble free crossing. Since the wall came down in 1989/90 the proliferation of new politically generated mega-walls round the planet has stimulated enduring interest in M√ºller-Hegemann's work on \\"Wall Sickness\\". 1973 was not actually the first time that M√ºller-Hegemann had labelled as a new psychiatric condition a selection of symptoms which a later generation might have been inclined to see as manifestations of some more generalised condition such as Posttraumatic stress disorder or Survivor guilt. Back in 1964 he had generated headlines in the west by identifying the then little considered mental illness which he called \\"KZ-Syndrom\\" (\\"Concentration Camp syndrome\\"). Early in 1973 M√ºller-Hegemann took charge of the Psychotherapy department at the Knappschafts-Krankenhaus (hospital) in Essen-Steel, in the Ruhr region of West Germany. In 1975 he reached retirement age for the hospital position: he continued to live in Essen, working as a self-employed Psychologist till 1988. It was still in Essen, in 1989, that Dietfried M√ºller-Hegemann, a couple of months ahead of what would have been his eightieth birthday.

The Paramaccans were runaway slaves who had made a peace treaty with the Colony in 1872. In 1879, a group of about 90 Paramaccans lead by Apensa created a settlement on an island in the Marowijne River near the mouth of the Paramacca Creek. The town was named Langatabiki (Long Island). The resort of Pamacca consists of the current area settled by the Paramaccans.

In 1923, he was appointed to Jordanhill College, the main teacher training college in Glasgow, where he stayed until 1946, rising to Principal Lecturer in Education. He also taught the EdB (later the MEd) course at The University of Glasgow. In addition, he was heavily involved with the Scottish Council for Research in Education, serving as its first director, from 1928 to 1958. Work Rusk produced a number of histories of education and lives of the great educators. He also researched and published the first history of teacher training in Scotland. Publications * Rusk, R.R.

The Chattahoochee river flows in from the north, before flowing through the West Point Dam, which impounds the lake, and continuing to Columbus, Georgia. Of the four major USACE lakes in the ACF River Basin, West Point Lake is the smallest by area containing of water, and has the second shortest shoreline at . The purposes of the reservoir are to provide flood control, hydroelectric power, and water storage to aid the navigation of the lower Chattahoochee. History The stylized logo of West Point Lake from the shoreline management plan. Authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1962, West Point Lake was built for several purposes and cost an estimated $105 million. Two major uses of the lake prescribed are power generation and recreation. The smaller percentage uses are: flood control, Fish and Wildlife, Area Redevelopment, and Navigation. In the master plan, it was decided to have a buffer from the water edge. This was done by using the flood pool level of above sea level or from the summer pool of , whichever was greater. This resulted in a total of of land being acquired and owned by the USACE. After being approved in 1964, construction began in 1965 with the west embankment and powerhouse access road being completed first in 1966. Also in 1966, a team discovered sites of archaeological significance and important sites were studied until 1971 before the lake was filled. When the lake was flooded, the floodplain would contain two historic covered bridges that would be inundated. The Wehadkee Creek bridge was privately salvaged in 1965 and relocated to Callaway Gardens while Glass' bridge was burned in 1954 as it was the only efficient means of destruction. The main channel was closed in May 1967 and diverted through the east bank. The dam itself began construction in May 1968 and was later completed in August 1970. The next closure was on June 21, 1973 as the river was routed through an opening for a future generator. The first generator was completed in May 1974; however, diking problems did not allow filling of the lake to begin until October 16, 1974. West Point Lake was filled from the river level at above mean sea level (aMSL) to aMSL. Due to continuing construction, the lake would not be allowed to fill any higher until April 30, 1975, after another power unit was completed. A major factor in building West Point Lake was navigation. A goal of the ACF river basin is to maintain a deep waterway on the Apalachicola River. After building West Point Lake, it was decided to raise the winter pool from aMSL. Before this, Walter F. George Lake and West Point Lake could not both be filled to their summer pools by the end of May without sacrificing water flow downstream and starving the Apalachicola River of needed water for navigation. This was not done earlier out of fear of flooding downstream during heavy rain periods. West Point Dam West Point Dam is a (LxHxD) concrete dam completed in 1975. The top of the dam is at above sea level. It has a long and deep power generation building which houses three main 48.8 MW units and one small 3.3 MW unit on the western portion of the dam and a spillway on the eastern portion, both which are controlled via microwave link at Walter F. George Lake with a local override. There are earth embankments that total long with the dam and there is a roadway on top of the embankments and concrete that allows the public to cross the dam. Depending on water level, the dam holds back anywhere from of water. During construction, rock was excavated should West Point need to add a navigable lock in the future to the right bank. Location and Surroundings West Point Lake begins at West Point Dam, north of the mouth of the Chattahoochee River, which is just north of the Jim Woodruff Dam or north of West Point, GA. West Point Lake is within of many semi-major cities in by Georgia and Alabama. In Georgia it has: Columbus, LaGrange, Newnan, Peachtree City, Carrollton and some parts of Atlanta. In Alabama it has: Phenix City, Opelika-Auburn, and Roanoke. Both sides of the lake are easily accessible from their respective sides, however crossing the lake can prove challenging as there are only two bridges that cross the main channel. Without crossing directly over the lake, one must go to Franklin or West Point to cross the river. At times, the West Point Dam can be crossed for a slightly shorter southern path. Wildlife and flora Wildlife enjoying West Point Lake When West Point Lake was filled, habitats for deer, dove, quail, and waterfowl were lost which caused important migratory bird routes to be disturbed. As such, the West Point Wildlife Management Area was created with a size of . In addition to the West Point Wildlife Management Area, two other wildlife management areas were created, Dixie Creek Area at and Glover's Creek Area at . An endangered species, the Bald eagle, is frequently seen in this part of the lake. There are many animals, including some harmful to humans, in and around the area. Two snakes known to the area that are venomous are the copperhead and cottonmouth. There are a few species of plants and animals that are tracked and knowingly occur in the area of West Point Lake. Three fish in this list are the bluestripe shiner, southern brook lamprey, and the highscale shiner. Only one bird is on this tracked list, the bachman's sparrow, along with 19 plants that include a sunflower, azalea, and a strawberry plant. Many types of common animals found in the southeastern United States are also found in the West Point Lake area including different species of bass, crappie, waterfowl, snakes, and turtles. The american alligator has been spotted in the area however very rare. With the wildlife previously mentioned, West Point Lake is a location where one has the ability to partake in hunting, fishing, shooting, and general wildlife viewing. Access and RecreationAccess= There are four types of access, known as shoreline allocations, at West Point Lake. ; Limited Development : Private floating facilities and some land activities may be authorized such as a dock or improved walkway and requires a permit from the USACE. There are approximately or 25 percent of the total shoreline miles allocated to this type. ; Protected : Contrary to limited development, private docks are prohibited unless grandfathered in. This area is a buffer meant to protect aesthetics, habitats, conflicts, and more between areas and was designed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act. This allocation requires a permit from the USACE and only allows a wide meandering pathway. There are approximately or 28.8 percent of the total shoreline miles allocated to this type. ; Prohibited : The shortest of the four allocations at , this allocation has prohibited or restricted access. The main area is close to the West Point Dam to protect boats and life from danger. ; Public Recreation : This area is for past or present public use and private use is prohibited. There are approximately or 46.1 percent of the total shoreline miles allocated to this type. This is the largest single allocation of West Point Lake. Locations of public parks, 2017 West Point Lake has the highest shoreline mileage and percentage of total shoreline miles allocated to public recreation areas of all USACE lakes in the ACF river basin. Thus making West Point Lake the most publicly accessible USACE lake in the basin. In addition to the large available public areas, the land buffer around the lake, regardless of allocation, is considered public land. With the exception of personal property (a boat dock) and the prohibited areas, the public is allowed anywhere on this buffer as an issued permit does not allow private exclusive rights anywhere on USACE property. =Recreation= In 2016, West Point Lake recorded 36 parks, 2 marinas, and 7 campgrounds. West Point Lake does not have its recreational areas concentrated in any one area of the lake, however, a large percentage of shoreline south of Georgia State Route 109 is public access. During the first three years of operation, there were only 26 parks available for a total of but annual visitation increased yearly from one million in 1976 to 4.2 million by 1981. Later, visitation numbers were affected greatly as water pollution increased from nearby Atlanta. Visitation numbers are unknown today, however many flock to lake during the annual fireworks display at Pyne Road Park that are accessible by boat or land. Watershed and Geology The Chattahoochee River basin near West Point Lake is elongated and is on average wide by long and contains an area of north of the West Point Dam. The Chattahoochee River flows in a southwest direction for to arrive at the West Point Dam after starting in the Blue Ridge Mountains in north Georgia. The northern portion of the river basin is in the Blue Ridge Region, but the middle region, where West Point is located, is in the Piedmont Region, north of the fall line. This produces rolling hills around the lake with the exception of the nearby Pine Mountain Range. The lake and other parts of the region contains soils with high iron- oxides and are clay-rich that make Georgia famous. Granite and soapstone are common minerals in area. The entire area of the Chattahoochee River basin is Pollution Satellite image The lake is sometimes criticized and brought into negative public light due to being the first impoundment south of Atlanta. Scientists were strongly attracted to West Point Lake for this reason and were eager to study the lake and the river. Studies were done in the early 1990s in detail to determine the effects of the urban environment on the lake. =Pre-lawsuit= Starting in the late 1970s, the lake was beginning to have water quality issues, which affected lake usership and eventually local economic damage. On 19 July 1988, the water being released from the lake downstream had become eutrophic and thus killing fish in the river. In February 1991, the GA Department of Natural Resources issued a fish consumption advisory for the lake, which extended downstream to Lake Harding on March 3rd. Also in 1991, as pollution damage was realized, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GEPD) and the City of Atlanta made a timetable to reduce phosphorus by the late 1990s. Atlanta continually failed to reduce pollution and was threatened by the GEPD with fines and sewer bans. This had the ability to damage the economics around the 1996 Olympic Games and further increase the amount of daily fines by $10,000. The daily fines were already at $9,000 per day and had totalled $20 million by 1997 for failing to complete sewer overflow treatment systems. =Lawsuit to Today= On October 10, 1995, the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeepers filed a lawsuit against the City of Atlanta for violation of the Clean Water Act by not upgrading facilities to meet standards. In 1998, two Federal Consent Decrees were ordered for the City of Atlanta to address its under-maintained wastewater system. In addressing the issues, a program was created at a cost of $4 billion that removed over 400 million gallons a year of sewer drainage into the rivers. In another part of the lawsuit, the City of Atlanta was issued a $2.5 million fine and volunteered to remove trash and establish greenways. In 1998, an investigation for polychlorinated biphenyls(PCBs) was completed and found fish contaminated. However this data is slightly misleading as Georgia does not use PCBs anymore thus contaminated fish are older from previous years. As of 2012, 97 percent of sewage from the 1990s was removed and expected to keep improving. In 2015 and 2017, bacteria levels were tested and published in the media showing normal and safe levels. The lake is tested regularly to the United States Environmental Protection Agency standards, results are posted for public view, and court admissible. Climate Many factors affect the lake and its basin. West Point Lake is in the southern end of the temperate zone and close to both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico which can bring tropical storms and hurricanes to the area. Thunderstorms produce much of the rainfall during the summer months as well as frontal systems. Flood inducing storms are most likely to occur in the area during winter and early spring as fronts. During the summer, convective thunderstorms are the leading source of rainfall with the occasional tropical storm. Snowfall can occur but rarely covers the ground for more than a few days. For the West Point Lake area as a whole, the record low is in LaGrange, GA on February 2, 1899 with the record high at in LaFayette, AL and Rock Mills, AL in late July 1952. Most of the time, rainfall is evenly distributed over all four seasons with a yearly average of .

Early life Spalding was born in Coeymans in Albany County, New York, the son of Nancy Reynolds Spalding (1793‚Äì1862) and Guy Carleton Spalding (1780‚Äì1854). In 1838 he married Cornelia Waldron (1822‚Äì1880). Their children were: Fanny Josephine Spalding (1840‚Äì1847); Charles Alfred Spalding (1842‚Äì1930), and Henry Waldron Spalding (1844‚Äì1874). He became known as \\"Doc\\" Spalding because he owned a drug and paint store at the corner of Lydius and Pearl Streets in Albany from 1840 to 1846.Gillian M Rodger, Champagne Charlie and Pretty Jemima: Variety Theater in the Nineteenth Century, University of Illinois Press (2010) - Google Books p. 77 Spalding's North American Circus The clown Dan Rice regularly performed for Spalding between 1844 and 1849 In about 1843 he accepted the circus belonging to Sam H. Nichols as security for a loan, allowing it to continue under Nichols' management until Spalding, realising he would not recoup his money as Nichols was doing bad business, visited the circus intending to bring it to Albany to sell it. However, finding that he enjoyed the circus life and that his temporary management was successful he decided to keep it as Spalding's North American Circus. In 1844 Spalding was carrying a ninety-foot tent around and had several stands at which people were turned away after 2,000 tickets were sold.Notes on the History of Circus Tents - Circus Historical Society In 1845 his circus was touring in CanadaSpalding's North American Circus (1845) - Circus Ontario website and during the 1847-48 season it was in New Orleans before moving up to the Mississippi River. Billed at this time as \\"The largest in the world. 200 men and horses! With all the appurtenances of corresponding extent and grandeur\\",Spalding's Monster North American Circus (1847) - William & Mary Libraries - William & Mary Law School on arriving at St. Louis Spalding divided his show into two, managing one himself and sending the other on the road under Col. Van Orden, Spalding's brother-in-law, as manager. This second company featured the clown Dan Rice as a star turn. Spalding chartered a steamboat called the Allegheny Mail and Rice's company cruised on the Ohio, Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, but the company was forced to disband in the winter of 1848-49 owing to an outbreak of cholera. In 1847 the celebrated British equestrienne Marie Macarte appeared with the circus, while the tight- rope walker James McFarland also performed with Spalding (1844-1849) and later with Spalding and Rogers (1848-1851),Slout, Olympians of the Sawdust Circle, p.189 as did the ‚ÄòShakespearean clown‚Äô John Hodges.Rice, Edward L., Monarchs of Minstrelsy, 1910 Spalding & Rogers The Appollonicon drawn by 40 horses - depicted on a postally used envelope (1856) In 1848 Spalding formed a partnership with the English circus-rider Charles J.

Spaulding: American circus impresario - Encyclop√¶dia Britannica In addition, theirs was the first to transport an entire circus by railroad. Another innovation was the Appollonicon, a 'Great Musical Chariot' or large bandwagon used for parades which was drawn by 40 cream-colored horses, four abreast but driven by one man who sat 80 feet behind the front horses holding ten reins in each hand - one for each two horses. The impressive 40-horse team was later used by Yankee Robinson in 1866, Dan Rice in 1873 and Barnum & Bailey in 1898, 1903 and 1904. =The Floating Palace= The showboat The Floating Palace on the Mississippi River - Gleason's Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion (1853) With Rogers he built The Floating Palace, an elaborate 200-foot long and sixty-foot wide two-story showboat launched in Cincinnati in May 1852 that toured the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. One of the largest showboats ever built, The Floating Palace contained a full-size circus ring for large-scale equestrian spectacles.Gilbert R. Spalding - The Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th ed., Columbia University Press The interior of The Floating Palace showing a circus act in progress (1854) The Floating Palace cost $42,000 to build and had 3,400 seats on two decks and was double the size of the St. James Theatre in New Orleans, at that time the city‚Äôs largest building and in which city the boat wintered for several years. The showboat's large amphitheatre had 1,000 seats on the main deck, 1,500 seats in the family circle and 900 segregated seats for its African-American audience. In addition to the 42-foot circus ring area, The Floating Palace also contained a museum with \\"100,000 curiosities of past years\\".Leavitt, P., & Moy, J. Spalding and Rogers' Floating Palace, 1852‚Äì1859. Theatre Survey, (1984), 25(1), pp. 15-27 The showboat was decorated with ornate mirrors, thick carpets and hand-carved woodwork. It had 200 gas jets for lighting the circus ring for its equestrian acts and also put on minstrel shows and theatrical performances. The Floating Palace was tugged by a towboat named the James Raymond that had a steam engine which provided heat and the gas supply for illumination as well as providing sleeping quarters for 50 performers and crew.Carolyn M. Bowers and Linda A. Fisher, Agnes Lake Hickok: Queen of the Circus, Wife of a Legend, University of Oklahoma Press (2007) - Google Books p. 64 The showboat employed over 100 people, including ship's crew, animal trainers, performers and front-of-house staff. It had facilities for the care of the animals and printed its own daily newspaper. The outbreak of the Civil War left The Floating Palace stranded in New Orleans where it was confiscated by the Confederate Forces in 1862 for use as a hospital ship. Undeterred, Spalding chartered a smaller steamboat which he renamed Dan Castello‚Äôs Great Show after a popular Southern clown and with the circus band playing 'Dixie' as required the company made its way back to the North.The Floating Palace - New Orleans Nostalgia: Remembering New Orleans History, Culture and Traditions - New Orleans Bar Association Spalding, Rogers & Bidwell The Bowery Theatre in New York in July 1867 Peoria Daily Transcript (1857) In 1856 Spalding and Rogers launched the steamer Banjo \\"expressly for the holding of Concerts, &c.;, &c.;, with a spacious Hall, equal to any on land, a spacious stage and appropriate scenery with renovations and improvements suggested by the experiments of last year.\\" In the same year with their new co-partner David Bidwell, whose previous career had been in restaurants and on boats, they took a ten year lease of the Pelican Theatre in New Orleans, renovating and redecorating it so that it could be used as either a circus or a theatre. It was renamed Spalding & Rogers Amphitheatre, which later again was changed to the Academy of Music. During the next few years Spalding & Rogers had two and sometimes three companies touring the USA and Canada, traveling by wagons, water and railroad, becoming the first circus to use the latter method of transportation for an entire circus. In 1860 Spalding and Rogers took a three- year lease on the Old Bowery in New York which they renovated and fitted with a movable stage so as to be able to cater for both equestrian and dramatic performances. Among their acts were the trapeze artists Fran√ßois and Auguste Siegrist and the tight-rope dancer Marietta Zanfretta.Slout, Clowns and Cannons, p. 43 In January 1861 they staged the spectacular Tippoo Sahib, or, the Storming of Seringapatam with many trick transformations including a vast enemy encampment, an Indian jungle near the Taj Mahal and a bombardment by British forces with a charge on foot and horse.Slout, Clowns and Cannons, p. 45 From there they transferred to The Boston Theatre (then known as the Academy of Music), where they played a highly successful engagement of some weeks' duration. After their experience with The Floating Palace early in 1862, Spalding and Rogers decided to avoid the Civil War altogether.Philip A. Loring, 'The Most Resilient Show on Earth: The Circus as a Model for Viewing Identity, Change, and Chaos', Ecology and Society, Vol. 12, No. 1 (Jun 2007) p. 2Fox, C. P., and T. Parkinson. 1969. 'The Circus in America', Country Beautiful, Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA (1969) In Spring of that year they constructed a magnificent portable amphitheatre upon an entirely new plan, the brigantine Hannah was purchased and fitted with accommodations for a circus company, and the next two years were passed in tours of Brazil, Uruguay, Buenos Aires and the West Indies. On the return voyage the vessel was wrecked at Long Branch, New Jersey, the people and horses, together with some of the baggage, being saved, but the amphitheatre, wardrobe, properties and vessel were lost. Despite this disaster, the venture was a great financial success, and it is said that more honors were bestowed upon the company than had been received by any other similar troupe in a foreign land. On their return to the United States in 1864, Spalding & Rogers took their circus to the newly built Hippotheatron in New York, where they opened for four weeks on 25 April 1864. During their stay a new roof was built and their company left on May 21.T. Allston Brown, A History of the New York Stage, Vol. 2, New York: Benjamin Bloom, Inc., 1903, pp. 353-356 In 1866 Spalding and Rogers dissolved their partnership, and Rogers retired from professional life and went to reside near Philadelphia. The co-partnership between Spalding and Bidwell continuing, shortly afterwards they leased and rebuilt the Olympic Theatre in St. Louis. Having already the Academy of Music in New Orleans they leased theatres in Mobile, Alabama, and Memphis, Tennessee, and established a theatrical circuit, which they conducted successfully for a few seasons, Thomas B. MacDonough being associated with them in a managerial capacity, and the firm being named Spalding, Bidwell & MacDonough. In 1867 a scheme was devised to send an American circus company to Paris in France, to perform during the Paris Exposition. The manager and backers of the company were Avery Smith, Gerard C. Quick, John J. Nathans, Dr. G.R. Spalding and David Bidwell. An edifice in which they were to have performed was built for the purpose of wood with a canvas top. It had forty-four private-boxes, an imperial loge, seven hundred and sixty parquet seats, fourteen hundred and twenty balcony seats, and a gallery capable of accommodating nearly two thousand persons, the seats being all cane-bottom chairs. Col. Van Orden had been sent in advance to Paris to prepare the way for the company, which was very strong. The chief attractions, according to the files of the New York Clipper, included James Robinson and his son Clarence, Frank Pastor, Robert Stickney, G M. Kelly, Lorenzo Maya, the Rollande Brothers, William Conrad, Charles Rivers, the performing horse Hiram, a performing buffalo, and a troupe of Indians. Most of the company and all the stock, consisting of twenty-three horses, two mules, and a buffalo, also four horses belonging to James Robinson, left New York in the steamship Guiding Star on March 30 1867, David Bidwell and Gerard C. Quick accompanying them. The other performers followed in steamships that sailed at later dates. After arriving in Paris, and when nearly all the preparations for their showing had been made, it was discovered that a local law prevented the erection of any wooden building within the city limits; consequently they could not use their pavilion, and, all other places being engaged, the venture was about to end in failure, when fortunately opportunity was given the American company to play for a brief time, but the result was not what had been expected. Later life In 1872 'Dr.' Spalding again put Dan Rice on the road with a show managed by his son Harry W. Spalding, who was dangerously wounded by a pistol shot in Baxter Springs, Kansas, which was probably the cause of his death, which took place at his father's residence in Saugerties in New York on February 4 1874. 'Dr.' Spalding's last venture in the circus business was during the tenting season of 1875, when he was the principal backer of Melville, Magintey & Cooke's Centennial Circus and Thespian Company. Spalding & Bidwell dissolved their co-partnership and in the division of the property David Bidwell retained the Academy of Music, New Orleans, and Spalding the Olympic Theatre, St. Louis, which was successfully managed by his son Charles Spalding. Spalding and Bidwell formed a new co-partnership and purchased the St. Charles Theatre in New Orleans which they intended to restore to its previous position of a first-class theatre but were unable to complete this plan owing to Spalding's death.Obituary for 'Dr' Gilbert R.

Where is crossing a railway line, it is a special kind of railway level crossing.  Introduction  In Victoria, this is authorised by section 36 of the original Act. Occupation crossings were historically granted to a landowner under Section 36 of the Lands Compensation Statute 1869 VIC and the subsequent corresponding legislation being Section 43 (2) of the Land Acquisition and Compensation Act 1986 VIC.Land Acquisition and Compensation Act 1986 VIC Other states would have similar Acts.Boundary Fences Act 1909 TAS (2018)Acquisition of Land Act 1967 QLD However, in the case of Stockinbingal, on the new Inland Railway Inland Railway I2S things are not that simple. Some railway land that is no longer used needs to be allocated to one or other of the adjacent landowners, while other lands are cut off from their original owners and would best be transferred to the other side, with compensation. This is because there are small pockets of land with awkward shapes, and other characteristics. There may need to be a Section 36A that permits all the neighbouring land owners and the railway authorities, once they have agreed amongst themselves, to allocate the remaining pockets of odd land as they see fit.  Types of Occupation Crossings  * level crossing of owner's access and railway; ** this is problematic if train speeds are high or visibility of approaching trains is poor; ** With some kind of level crossing warning signals. ** communication via phone with signaller for permission to cross. ** communication via emails, etc., from signalling system. * overpass or overbridge; possibly expensive unless convenient cutting is available. * under pass with normal clearances; expensive unless convenient embankment is available. * under pass with limited clearances for humans, livestock, and low height farm machinery; ** sometimes spare spans of am existing bridge or culvert is available. * access via existing alternate routes; * where new or altered fences and gates are needed, under the NSW Dividing Fences Act,Dividing Fences Act 1991 NSWFencing Disputes QLDLand Acquisition SA the cost can be shared, or alternately the railway supplies the material and the land owner provides the labour. Old obsolete railway rails can be used to make strong fence posts.  Land Acquisition  The Inland Railway project requires land acquisition.Land Acquisition VIC Land Acquisition NSW = Stockinbingal = This is a work in progress, and while the design of the tracks is near perfect from the railway point of view, the effect on land ownership is messy. Only one site for an occupation underpass is obviously workable (near the overbridge), while other sites need more study. Stockinbingal Land Ownership, Occupational crossings and Fences There is a very small area of Paddock cut off from its parent paddock (A) which is hardly worth keeping unless whole of area Z is claimed. Area Z might best be attached to Paddock B. Lastly area Z might be sold to someone else given that the odd shape makes it suitable for little else but agistment of sheep or goats. Is livestock happy with the darkness of the underpass or are they wary of it? Note that former railway lands may be contaminated by oil spills from trains, or from herbicides used to keep down weeds. It is undesirable that area Z be accessed by road/rail level crossing(s).

Historically this area of the South Pennines was part of Yorkshire but since 1974 it has been within the eastern edge of the county of Greater Manchester. The valley and the surrounding Saddleworth Moor are designated as 'Open Access' land for the public, following the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Much of Saddleworth Moor is a 9,000 year-old peat landscape of blanket bog. The upper Greenfield Valley is part of the Dark Peak SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). The millstone grit moorland is typically covered with grasses, mosses, heather and bilberry and is habitat for mountain hares and moorland birds such as red grouse, lapwing, skylark, curlew, golden plover and meadow pipit. The RSPB operates Dove Stone Nature Reserve in the valley, which includes old quarry cliffs that are home to peregrine falcons. The Trinnacle is a dramatic large stack of three gritstone pillars at Raven Stones Brow. Since glaciers and ice sheets carved the cliff edge during the last Ice Age, weathering and frost-shattering of the rocks over thousands of years have formed the three-pronged Trinnacle outcrop. There are nearly 200 graded rock climbing routes on Ravenstones Crag. The valley's main stream Greenfield Brook is fed by Holme Clough and Birchen Clough. Greenfield Brook flows into Greenfield Reservoir and then on into Yeoman Hey Reservoir and Dovestone Reservoir. It then flows into Chew Brook which is a tributary of the River Tame, which feeds the River Mersey. The Ashton under Lyne, Stalybridge and Dukinfield Waterworks Joint Committee's reservoir scheme began in the Greenfield Valley in 1870. Yeoman Hey Reservoir was completed in 1880 (capacity of 780 million litres and 20m deep). Greenfield Reservoir was built from 1897 to 1902. It is the smallest of the reservoirs (capacity of 464 million litres and 20m deep). Dovestone Reservoir is the largest of the three reservoirs in the valley. It has a capacity of 4887 million litres and is up to 31m deep. The dam is 38m high and 550m long. It was built in 1967 and the Dovestone Sailing Club was established the same year. The reservoirs are operated by United Utilities and supply water to the surrounding area including Oldham. Spruce and pine plantations are found in the lower valley and broad-leaved trees have been introduced to provide a more diverse habitat. Ashway Cross Industrialist John Platt built Ashway Gap House in 1850 on the south side of the valley. It was used as a shooting lodge until his brother James (MP for Oldham) was killed in a grouse shooting accident on the moors in 1857. Ashway Cross was erected on the moorland as a memorial to James. The vacant mansion and its estate were bought in 1897 by the waterworks board, which allowed it to be used as a Red Cross hospital for wounded soldiers during World War I. In World War II the house was used to billet Italian prisoners of war. After the house fell into decline it was demolished in 1981. There are two World War II pillboxes (gun emplacements) on the A625 road opposite Yeoman Hey Reservoir. The pillboxes were built into a rock outcrop in c.1940 as part of defences against a possible invasion. The pair are connected by an underground passage. They are protected Grade II listed buildings. Downstream from the reservoirs is Greenfield village in the Chew Valley.

First joint projects  Alexander and Nicole (maiden name Kors) met in 1990 in Brussels and were baptised into the Orthodox faith and married at the Novodevichy Convent in Moscow in the same year. At baptism, Nicole received the name Tatiana. The couple were married by father Mikhail Ryazantsev. In 1998, the Gratovskys created the Ultimate Experience Club, engaged in the study of human possibilities, existential consulting, transformative practices and logotherapy in Europe (Belgium) and Russia. Collaborators included leading psychologists, in particular, Jean Becchio and Alexander Asmolov. The Club developed and published a number of humanitarian technologies in the field of conscious construction of the future in the form of collective monographs. Based on the results of the Club‚Äôs projects, the Gratovskys wrote a series of documentary adventure novels under the pseudonym Alex Forain. In the early 2000s, the Gratovskys began to engage in independent ‚Äúnon-invasive‚Äù studies of free-living dolphins and whales. Having spent more than 5,000 hours with free dolphins and whales, based on their own experience of interaction with them, as well as numerous scientific data indicating the high level of intelligence of cetaceans, their possession of self-awareness, a highly-organised society and culture, the Gratovskys consider cetaceans to be carriers of the most developed (although organised differently to that of humans) consciousness on the planet, with ‚Äúcapabilities and a way of life that contain highly important lessons for humans.\\"  Dolphin Embassy  In 2008, the Gratovskys created the Dolphin Embassy: ‚Äúan interdisciplinary centre considering the modern era, not from the anthropocentric position of the ‚Äúconqueror of nature‚Äù and the ‚Äúcrown of creation,‚Äù but from the perspective of the planet as a unified, living and intelligent organism and, as a special case, from the position of dolphins and whales.\\" The Embassy is simultaneously a research, consulting, production and cultural centre, with its permanent headquarters on Tenerife (Canary Islands). This location was chosen due it being both minimally politically engaged and one of the world‚Äôs ‚Äúcapitals‚Äù of cetaceans. The Embassy appoints ‚Äúcharg√©s d'affaires.‚Äù According to the project‚Äôs creators, these are individuals whose main concern and interest are the planet and humanity as a whole. The Embassy‚Äôs official website and a series of interviews by the Gratovskys indicate that they include approximately one hundred prominent scientists and cultural figures from different countries, among the first of whom were Umberto Eco, Ervin Laszlo, Giacomo Rizzolatti, Slava Polunin and others. The Embassy organises independent research expeditions (including the round-the-world \\"Archaeology of Possibilities\\" project,) publishing their results in films and books, as well as presenting them during special public events. One area of research is the possibility of interaction between humans and wildlife, in particular, experiments on the creation of a direct ‚Äúdialogue‚Äù between free dolphins/whales and outstanding modern jazz improvisation musicians (including Arkady Shilkloper, Davide Swarup, David Rothenberg), carried out on the Embassy‚Äôs expedition vessels using underwater acoustic equipment. The video of the musician and public figure Mikhail Kazinik relating the story of one of these experiments in the Federation Council of the Russian Federation in June 2017 evoked significant public interest and gained more than 693,000 views on YouTube (as at 20 May 2020).  Public Activity  The Gratovskys engage in public speaking, as well as organisation of educational and cultural events. Central events include the annual Dolphinity World Festival on Tenerife, as well as Dolphin Day at the St. Petersburg International Cultural Forum, focused on the nature of consciousness, the unity of the world and the possibility of direct interaction between mankind and the universe. In 2017, the multimedia exhibition \\"Just Like You. Human and Dolphin\\" was visited by 8,000 people over two days. On 18 November 2017, the Dolphin Language and Culture scientific and practical conference was organised by the Gratovskys in St. Petersburg with the participation of leading cetacean researchers, such as Jim Darling, Hal Whitehead and Toni Frohoff, among others. This resulted in the adoption of the ‚ÄúInternational Declaration on the Protection of the Rights and Freedom of Dolphins and Whales,‚Äù which recognises cetaceans as ‚Äú(non- human) individuals with self-awareness, endowed with intelligence and feelings,‚Äù in 10 points establishing a new type of relationship between humans and cetaceans: without violence, exploitation and slavery. The Declaration has been signed by prominent scientists, public figures and cultural figures from different countries. From 10-14 October 2019, the NOW Worldview Assembly, organised by the Gratovskys, took place in Delphi, Greece. The Assembly brought together more than 100 thinkers, authors of breakthrough scientific discoveries, ideas and practices from around the world. The Assembly‚Äôs initiators formulated the event‚Äôs purpose as follows: Participants included Ashok Khosla, co-chair of the United Nations Environment Programme International Resource Panel; Barry Kerzin, personal physician to the Dalai Lama; Janusz Wi≈õniewski, writer, author of the novel Loneliness on the Net; Maneka Gandhi, Minister for Women and Child Development of the Government of India, animal rights advocate; Gerald Pollack, author of the theory of the fourth phase of water; George Ovashvili, film director, screenwriter and producer; Kalevi Kull, head of the International Society for Biosemiotic Studies; heads of the foremost international associations of thinkers, the Club of Rome and the Club of Budapest; among others. The Assembly was held behind closed doors, deliberately excluding the presence of journalists and members of the general public. The Assembly‚Äôs report, published as a separate book, concludes that urgent changes to humanity‚Äôs current way of life and hierarchy of values are necessary and inevitable, and new definitions of fundamental existential concepts, such as intelligence, consciousness and life, among others, are proposed in the form of modern Delphic Maxims, with the first being: ‚ÄúConsciousness is the ability to choose the future.‚Äù  Books  * Out of the Box (English and French title) under the pseudonym Alex Forain.

The factory logo is present at the base of the panel, in the form of a cobalt blue sceptre. The design was determined in a competition that was won by the graphic artist Wieland Sch√ºtz. History As early as the 19th century, the Berlin Magistrate began to erect commemorative plaques and commemorative signs for people and events in the public spaces. For example, for the year 1930, the list includes 59 commemorative plaques in the inner district alone and a further 47 copies in all other districts of Berlin were hung. In the 20th century, uniform representations were sought and the Berlin plaque was developed. Chronology1985‚Äì1991= Originally, the design of the plaque cost Deutsche Marks. According to the plans at the time, each district of West Berlin would receive about 25 plaques, sponsored by the Berliner Sparkasse. The first three plaques were placed on 22 October 1985. =1992‚Äì2000= After the Peaceful Revolution the memorial plaque program was extended to the East Berlin, with the Sparkasse again paying the costs of the program. A total of 350 panels, now worth 3,000 marks per table, were planned by the year 2000. The technical supervision of the new project was taken over by the Historical Commission of Berlin. By the turn of the century, the funds provided by the Sparkasse had been exhausted. =From 2000= After the turn of the century, it was decided that an applicant must make a payment of 2500 Euro's, gain permission from the owner of the property where the plaque is to be placed and gain permission from the district council () before proceeding with the placement of the plaque. Once that is completed, the Historical Commission of Berlin will drawn up an agreement with the applicant, to ensure it appropriate. Wieland Sch√ºtz then provides the graphic implementation of the text, partly with further design features. The final pressure on the board is done by the KPM. Finally, the applicant ensures that the plaque is affixed correctly, which will then become the property of the respective district office.

He was also rector of More, Shropshire.  Biography  George Lawson was born in 1598, and educated at Puritan Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Lawson was a prot√©g√© of William Laud. Lawson was a supporter of the parliament, and accordingly retained his rectory during the Commonwealth. Lawson wrote to Baxter on the appearance of the latters Aphorismes of Justification, 1649, and Baxter valued his criticisms; \\"especially\\", he writes, \\"his instigating me to the study of politicks [...] did prove a singular benefit to me\\". Baxter says that he had seen in manuscript arguments by Lawson in favour of taking the engagement. He became rector of More, Shropshire, before 22 April 1686. His religious views inclined to Arminianism. He was buried at More 12 July 1678. Lawson, who was certainly not a Yorkshireman, must be distinguished from George Lawson (1606‚Äì1670) of Moreby, son of George Lawson of Poppleton, Yorkshire, who became rector of Eykring, Northamptonshire, and who may be identical with the George Lawson who was ejected as a royalist from the vicarage of Mears Ashby, Northamptonshire, by the parliamentarians (Walker, Attempt, ii. 296), and then became schoolmaster at Houghton Conquest, Bedfordshire.

He became famous as the founder of James Baines & Co. that ran a fleet of 86 ships on the Liverpool Black Ball line between England and Australia in 1851‚Äì1871.  Early life  He was born in Upper Duke Street, Liverpool, the son of William Baines and Mary Picton. He married Anne Netherton in 1848 and had two daughters. After her husband died in 1829, his mother ran a very successful confectionery manufacturing business which provided a wedding cake for the Royal Family. This may have been the source of some of the funds Baines used to set up his shipping business in 1851.  The Liverpool Black Ball Line  At the peak of his success the Black Line had 86 ships and over the course of its existence carried some ten thousands of immigrants to Australia, more than any other line at the time. After the cessation of the Black Ball Line in 1871, James Baines operated four ships under his own name.  Legacy  James Baines has been suggested as an inspiration for the character of James Onedin in the popular BBC drama The Onedin Line, created by Liverpool-born Cyril Abraham.

Youth  Steve Tallis was born in 1952 in Maylands, Western Australia, a suburb of Perth. He started playing music in 1962. In February 1963, after attending a Louis Armstrong and Trini Lopez concert at the Capitol Theatre in Perth with his parents, Steve was very inspired and told his mother that he wanted to become a professional musician. Surrounded by the traditional Macedonian music of his ancestors and traditional Greek, Yugoslav, Bulgarian and Turkish music, Steve discovered at an early age trance rhythms, improvisation and singing. Steve Tallis was also influenced by music on the radio at the time, Them, The Animals, The Rolling Stones, Manfred Mann, Jimi Hendrix, The Yardbirds, The Kinks, The Loved Ones or Spectrum. He later was influenced by artists such as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan or by bengali Bauls. He started up many bands throughout his youth, notably My Grandfather's Blues which was awarded \\"Band of the year\\" in 1967 during Hoadley's Battle of Bands, organised in parallel to the annual competition Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds.  Style  Praised for his unconventional work, his favourite genre is blues. He described his music as ethnic blues or tribal folk, a mix between blues and world music, with a touch of folk and gospel. He has often been compared to a storyteller. His style has been compared to that \\"of Van Morrison and Calvin Russell, but with a peculiar originality and a return to the roots of blues.\\" He has especially been influenced by blues, gospel and Field hollers. He refers today to many musicians who marked his work, such as Leadbelly, John Coltrane, Tim Buckley, Captain Beefheart, Sun Ra, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Kevin Coyne, Son House, Tom Waits, Jack Bruce and Kip Hanrahan. Moreover, his music is still influenced by African, Indian, Haitian or Arab traditional music, on a spiritual level as well as on a rhythmic one. = Spiritual aspect = Trying to go back to the roots of his influences, he studied traditional musics and their spiritual dimension. Many journeys, in India (1997), Pakistan (2003) and Ghana (2005) among others, led him to explore different spiritualities that had a strong impact on his musical production : voodoo, tantra, buddhism, sufism, hinduism or Native American religions. Steve Tallis has been called a griot or a \\"blues shaman\\", his music being entrenched in an oral tradition of storytelling, and his music has been called \\"tribal or even shamanic folk from an Australian griot open on world music.\\"  Music career  Creating music = From 1975 on, Steve Tallis started a solo career, during which he gathered many musicians to accompany him in making music but most importantly in live performances. Among other recurring bands can be found Broken Things, My Grandfather's Blues, Jellyroll Bakers, Lucy Crown, Bitch, Fried Egg / Unit Structures, Opposition, Steve Tallis Washboard Unit, Zombi Party, Suicide Ghosts, Holy Ghosts, Troublemakers or Snakes of Desire.  Albums  In 2001, Steve Tallis released the first part of a limited edition anthology titled Anthology Volume 1 ‚Äì The Sacred Path of the Fried Egg ‚Äì From Maylands to the Gates of Hell (1962‚Äì2001). It is made of 8 CDs gathering a selection of live and studio recordings, and a booklet. It tells the story of the evolution of his music, his relationship with the city of Perth and its blues scene. Local musicians and friends of Steve are featured in the anthology, bringing back to life the jazz, blues and R&B; music scene of the 1970s and 1980s, what led to the anthology being described as a \\"document of West Australia music culture.\\" The 2004 album Loko has been produced with members of The Suicide Ghosts, percussionist Gary Ridge and violinist Dave Clarke, and develops the spiritual and shamanistic dimensions already present in the 1999 album Zozo. He explored Afro-American hollers and classics such as the negro spiritual song \\"He‚Äôs Got the Whole World in his Own Hands\\" in the 2006 acoustic album Jezebel Spirit, accompanied by percussionist Gary Ridge. The First Degree, which came out in 2014, was recorded with multi-instrumentalist Skip McDonald, best known as Little Axe, and drummer Evan Jenkins, a friend of Steve Tallis he had worked with in the Apache Dropouts band, and on the recording of the album Zombi Party. His upcoming album Where Many Rivers Meet, scheduled for 2020, is a solo album recorded in mono, mixing tracks on the electric guitar Gibson SG 1961, acoustic Martin D8 1969 and 12 string acoustic Guild Jumbo 1969, and a cappella Field hollers. = Premi√®res parties = He played with and accompanied many international and Australian musicians, as a guest or playing first parts.

In 2007, he worked on the release and promotion of his album Loko in France, which was met with great success, called an \\"a typical yet very blues album\\" or a \\"perfect alchemy [...] between blues roots and more contemporanean and avant-garde styles.\\" = Promoting music = Alongside his career as a musician, Steve has always been active in the field of music. He worked for Australia's legendary import record shops, 78 Records (1975‚Äì1979) and joined Audex Sound, Australia's leading equipment hire company, in 1976. In 1983, he created the radio program Spoonful of Blues, that still showcases non- conventional blues music, on 6UVSFM, now RTRFM, a Perth based Australian radio. He launched his own independent record distribution company, Monkey Music, record store importing and exporting music from worldwide musicians to facilitate their distribution in Australia (1985).

History The garrison church, dedicated to St Alban the Martyr and St Barbara, was built in 1937 and replaced an earlier wooden church. The architect, as for the officers' mess, was William Ross; construction is in red brick, with a short southwest tower. In 2011 the church became the regimental church of the Royal Artillery. The regimental chapel at the Woolwich Barracks closed around the same time, and two stained glass windows were moved to the Larkhill church where they are displayed in lightboxes. One of these is by Christopher Whall, an Arts & Crafts artist. In 2015, as part of the 300th anniversary celebrations of the Royal Artillery, an additional memorial was created outside the existing structure. Designed to look like the surviving perimeter wall and chapel of St George's Garrison Church, Woolwich, the former Royal Artillery Garrison Chapel, it is painted in the Regimental colours of red and blue. The memorial houses some of the memorial plaques from the Woolwich chapel and a memorial to those members of the Royal Artillery who have been awarded the Victoria Cross. Planned to be completed in time for the 300th anniversary in May 2016, construction was delayed due to concerns over the impact of work close to the Stonehenge World Heritage Site. Instead, Her Majesty the Queen, the Royal Artillery Captain General, laid the cornerstone during her visit to Larkhill in May 2016 and the building was completed in time for the dedication ceremony at the annual St Barbara's Day Service (the Royal Artillery's Patron Saint) on 4 December 2016.

It was built in the 14th century by the Visconti, lords and dukes of Milan. History The castle was initiated by Azzone Visconti in 1335 and completed by Galeazzo II Visconti in 1372. Its design followed the typical quadrangular shape of the Visconti castles with an internal courtyard surrounded by arcades and a tower for each corner. However, in Voghera, a simple wall closes one side. The castle laid on the border between the Voghera city (to the north) and the countryside (to the south). Two additional towers were built on the northern and southern sides, over the two entrances. A moat surrounded the castle. Two drawbridges, on both sides of the castle, crossed the ditch. In the following centuries, the castle underwent mutilations. The towers at the four corners were shortened. In 1647, during the Franco-Spanish War (1635‚Äì1659), the French demolished the tower over the north entrance. In the 18th century, the north wing was transformed into a residential palace. In the 19th century, the moat was filled with earth. Since the Napoleonic era, the castle had been used as a prison. Ceased this use, the first restorations began in the 1920s. The restoration ended at the beginning of the 21st century, allowing the opening of the castle to the public. In the east wing, fragments of frescoes attributed to Bartolomeo Suardi, a 15th-century painter, were revealed and restored. Today The castle is the property of the Italian State. Periodically it is open for exhibitions and cultural events.

Peaceful beginnings and objectives Following detailed planning by high-school student activists groups of students from various private and state schools abandoned classrooms and went on strike by heading to the streets of the main towns where most secondary schools were located. They marched peacefully from the inland towns of Curepipe, Vacoas, Quatre-Bornes, Rose Hill, Beau Bassin and other parts of the island in order to head towards the capital city Port Louis. The main objectives of the student activists during the rally consisted of the following: 1\\\\. Remove inequality between poorly funded \\"private colleges\\" when compared to state- funded schools and Catholic schools 2\\\\. Replace outdated content of textbooks which perpetuated a colonial bias 3\\\\. Improve the quality of teaching staff Riot police intervention By the time that the student marchers had gone past the town of Beau Bassin the crowd had reached significant size. At the historic bridge of Grand River North West (GRNW) near La Tour Koenig local police prevented the crowd from progressing towards the capital city of Port Louis. Besides elements of Police Riot Unit (PRU) had arrived on site and soon there was a crack-down using tear gas and batons against unarmed student protesters. Several students were also arrested. Several shops (such as the ones on Desforges and Leoville L‚ÄôHomme Streets in the capital Port Louis) and buses near the rally were damaged. An angry crowd ransacked the home of a prominent PMSD member of Parliament and member of the ruling alliance M.H. Ythier. Later that day at New Eton College in Rose Hill around fifty students were arrested after an intervention by the Police Riot Unit which attempted to disperse a gathering there. By 21 May 1975 the press reported that police had made 118 arrests. In addition to the looted shops there were reports of 40 damaged buses and 4 buses had been destroyed by arsonists. The government was preparing to prosecute the arrested protesters under provisions of Sections 17 and 48 of the Public Order Act (POA). In response a hunger strike was organised by a group of students and after ten days the charges were dropped. Events prior to the 1975 Riots There had been mounting discontent amongst the young adults and students due to increasing unemployment and high cost of living. Besides tropical cyclone Gervaise had damaged many schools which had already been suffering from poorly equipped laboratories and libraries and a lack of sporting infrastructure. In February 1975 students at London College (Mauritius) had protested against the dismissal of two teachers. The Labour- IFB-CAM coalition had been in power since the 1967 elections and after the March 1968 Independence celebrations the IFB dropped out of the coalition in 1969 and ended up in Opposition. To maintain power and a majority of seats in Parliament the leader of Labour Party (Mauritius) struck a new deal with its rival PMSD which resulted in Labour-CAM-PMSD coalition ruling the country. Within PMSD several figures were against this deal and that splinter group formed a new party UDM. Although elections were scheduled to occur in 1972 Labour and what was left of the original PMSD amended the Constitution via a Bill which postponed the 1972 elections to 1976. Meanwhile the new party Mouvement Militant Mauricien (MMM) had gained popularity, even electing its first ever candidate Dev Virahsawmy to Parliament at the September 1970 by- elections at Constituency No.5 as he won the seat previously held by a ruling IFB's deceased candidate Lall Jugnauth. On 25 November 1971 the MMM political activist Azor Adelaide was shot dead by a gang of rival activists in the centre of the town of Curepipe near the intersection of Royal Road and Rue Chasteauneuf. Azor was travelling with in Dev Virahsawmy's car as they prepared to meet Paul Berenger to install some posters regarding an upcoming public gathering. This followed a previous attempt to assassinate MMM leader Paul Berenger during which his assistant Fareed Muttur died in suspicious circumstances after a car accident on 01 October 1971. Another example of political violence was the attack on student activist and MMM sympathiser Raja Bhadain who was stabbed by a PMSD thug wielding scissors at a public gathering. MMM had collaborated with various trade unions such as GWF to organise strikes throughout the island. As a result 12 Trade Union leaders and most leaders of MMM were jailed for 9 months until December 1972. State of Emergency was declared in 1971 and the Public Order Act (POA 1973) was enforced. Later in 1975 the State of Emergency was lifted in preparation for the 1976 elections. For several years prior to 1975 students from various secondary schools such as John Kennedy College, Queen Elizabeth College (QEC), New Eton College, Royal College Curepipe (RCC), and Royal College Port Louis (RCPL) had gathered at various student events where debates were held about the need to overhaul the educational system amongst other social and political issues. These events included the \\"cClubs\\". Other movements like the ‚ÄúFront National pour la Lib√©ration des Etudiants ‚Äù(FNLE) and the Student Club assisted in the effort. Free education and Educational Reform The May 1975 Students protest and riots resulted in significant changes in the educational system of the island. Following the 1976 General Elections the Labour-CAM-PMSD coalition government granted \\"Free Education\\" by eliminating the compulsory monthly school fees. It also undertook a reform of the secondary school sector in line with the objectives of the 20 May 1975 student protest and also included the following improvements: 1\\\\. The Private Secondary Schools Authority (PSSA) was created in 1978 to reduce the gap between private and public schools including wages of teaching staff 2\\\\. The Mauritius Institute of Education (MIE) overhauled curricula to include more local Mauritian content 3\\\\. \\"Junior Scholarship\\" was replaced by Certificate of Primary Education (CPE) 4\\\\.

It is a visceral sensation that depends on the condition under which the purchase is made. The pain of paying. (Doctoral dissertation). Department of Social and Decision Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA. During the payment process, the handing over of money is akin to losing money.

The pain of paying is often heralded as a tool to curb individuals' spending.Prelec, D., & Loewenstein, G. (1998). The red and the black: Mental accounting of savings and debt.

The pain of paying. (Doctoral dissertation).

Bank deduction (direct debit) and credit card were preferred, whereas check and cash were judged to be the most painful, and the least preferred. The least painful payment methods were not only preferred, they were also the most frequently used. =Card payments= Zellermayer's dissertation is not the only research looking into the pain of paying as related to card payments. Applying the reduced pain of paying to credit cards would be able to explain the effects seen within credit card usage.

The pain of paying would account for these phenomena occurring by the reduced salience associated with lower levels of pain. Notably different from normal card payments, in which signatures, swiping or PIN-verification is used, are contactless card payments. Looking exclusively at cards, research has found that individuals predominantly using contactless cards were less aware of their spending, were more likely to spend more and felt less in control over their spending James, B.

Research on Individual Characteristics In addition to the pain of paying not being constant across different methods of payment, it also does not hold constant across individuals. Research has shown that different types of people experience different levels of pain of paying, which can in turn affect spending decisions Rick, S. I., Cryder, C. E., & Loewenstein, G. (2008). Tightwads and spendthrifts.

Prelec, D., Loewenstein, G., & Zellermayer, O. (1997). Closet tightwads: Compulsive reluctance to spend. In Association for Consumer Research Conference, Denver. Derived from this, a more detailed scale was developed to indicate how much pain was experienced during the process of spending, called the tightwad-spendthrift scale, where tightwads experience higher levels of the pain of paying, as compared to spendthrifts who experience lower levels of the pain of paying. Research has also looked into the possible effects of marketing on this scale: tightwads are particularly sensitive to marketing contexts that make spending less painful Rick, S. I. (2018).

Neuroscientific Research The pain of paying is not an exclusively behavioral phenomenon. Neuroscientific studies have shown that the pain of paying exists on a neural level. In addition to merely representing costs or loss in a rational sense, the ‚Äúpain of paying‚Äù theory argues that price can elicit an aversive response akin to physical pain (Prelec and Loewenstein 1998, Rick et al. 2008). The results for nucleus accumbens (reward centre) and medial prefrontal cortex indicate that even if price primacy evoked pain early in the decision process, that pain did not systematically lower estimates of product value, nor did it prevent or decrease purchasesKarmarkar, U.

INSEAD working paper. showed similar results Other Theories on Payment Methods The pain of paying is not the only theory aiming to explain the different behaviours associated with different payment methods. Dilip Soman produced the framework of payment transparency, in which he argues that it is the transparency of the payment method, focusing on its reflection of value, that determines how salient, or painful, the payment is Soman, D. (2003). The effect of payment transparency on consumption: Quasi-experiments from the field. Marketing Letters, 14(3), 173-183.. The observations and predictions made by Soman closely align those of Zellermayer. Both relate to the degree of coupling (i.e., the strength of the dyadic relationship) between payment and consumption as influencing the severity of the pain of paying. A second theory which looks into the effect of payment method on the pain of paying is the theory of decoupling, as proposed by Raghubir and Srivastava. Raghubir, P., & Srivastava, J. (2008). Monopoly money: The effect of payment coupling and form on spending behavior. Journal of experimental psychology: Applied, 14(3), 213. Within this theory the coupling of payment and pain of paying refers to its concurrency. This theory too, is based on Zellermayer's concept that the pain of paying affects consumers' payment-time/mode preferences. The concurrency of payment method with paying (the good/service has to be paid for as it is obtained), determines its pain. Payment methods that don't allow for this concurrency are decoupled, and as such the pain of paying for the good/service is postponed, whereas the pleasure from obtaining the good/service is immediately experienced. The decoupling theory focuses predominantly on the different behaviours associated with credit card usage. Credit cards being the only method that allows for non-concurrent payment at the point of sale.

Pleske was born in Peterhof to the upper class German family of Eduard Ludwig (1817-1873) and Margaret Elisabeth Oom (1882-1880). His brother was Eduard Dmitrievich Pleske (1854-1904) who served in the finance ministry. Pleske went to the 2nd St. Petersburg Classical Gymnasium, the German Grammar School St. Petri-Schule, graduating in 1878 to join St Petersburg University. In 1880 he joined an expedition to the Kola Peninsula organized by the St Petersburg Society of Naturalists. He was already interested in birds and made collections which he donated to the Zoological Museum in 1881 where he worked under V.F. Russov and M.N. Bogdanov. After graduating he worked in Vladivostok in the administration but his health suffered and he returned in 1883 to St Petersburg and joined the museum as a volunteer. After the retirement of Bogdanov in 1886 he became an assistant of the director A.A. Strauch. He worked on the birds of the Kola peninsula and then studied the collections of Russov from Turkmenistan. In 1893, Strauch recommended Pleske for election to the Academy of Sciences. Pleske was made a member of the managing committee of the museum. Under Pleske, the museum was to be reconstructed. Somewhere in 1896 Pleske suffered from the pressures of the reconstruction and resigned. V.V. Zalensky was made director of the museum and Pleske. He also officially resigned from the Academy of Sciences on October 2, 1896. Pleske had a conflict with Andrei Petrovich Semenov (or Semenov-Tian-Shansky) which may also have precipitated his resignation. Following the Russian revolution, many wealthy people had to seek work again. In 1918 Pleske applied for work at the museum and he chose not to work with birds due to potential exposure to arsenic and instead began to work on insects. He worked on the Stratiomyiidae. In 1919 he again work on birds, examining the material from the Russian Polar Expedition of 1900-1903. After the death of V.L. Bianchi in 1920 he was made head of the Department of Ornithology. When P.P. Sushkin joined in 1921, he moved back to study Diptera. He also began to work on the organization of library. In 1932, Pleske may have been arrested as his name was repressed from the members of the Academy of Sciences. The reasons are unknown. He died on August 1, 1932 and was buried in the Smolenskoe Lutheran cemetery in St. Petersburg.

The bridge is named after Indian politician and thinker Deendayal Upadhyaya. A connected 3-way interchange flyover bridge was constructed on the Athwa side to facilitate easy flow of traffic.  Background  The construction of a new bridge over the Tapti River at Athwa was proposed in 2006. S. N. Bhobe and Associates, Navi Mumbai, was selected as the designer for both of the bridges in 2008. S. N. Bhobe and Associates has been designing projects for the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) since 2006. The same company previously designed the Fly Over Bridge at Nana Varachha junction, Fly Over Bridge at Kapodra Fire Station junction, Hajira - Adajan Flyover bridge and Shri Swami Dayanand Saraswati bridge across the Tapti River for SMC. Construction work for the cable-stayed bridge started in 2010. The construction this portion of the bridge (River-Bridge) was contracted to Gammon India and the connected 3-way interchange flyover bridge on the Athwa side of the main river bridge was contracted to Rachana Construction. Spectrum Techno Consultant Private Limited was appointed as Project Manager Consultant to supervise the entire construction work and to ensure that the construction was taking place as per standards.  Incident  On 25 May 2014 concrete slab work was being carried out at the sharp turning portion of the 3-way interchange flyover bridge. On 10 June 2014 workers started removing the staging plates (formwork) from the slab, whose concrete was poured 15 days earlier on 25 May. Around 8 a.m. the whole slab weighing 650 tonnes, and of 35 metres in length, collapsed from 40 feet high. 16 workers were buried under the slab, 10 workers died on-the-spot and 6 sustained major or minor injuries.  Investigation  'Gujarat Engineering Research Institution (GERI), Vadodara' was appointed to investigate the site, debris and material used for construction. Based on the GERI report the material used for construction was of poor quality. The design documents were sent to Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, Surat (SVNIT) for verification. As per the SVNIT report there were major flaws in the design of that sharply curved part of the bridge. The sharp curvature was not taken into account by the designer, instead the design calculation was based on a straight slab, actually the detailed analysis should have been performed for that curved section. The center of gravity of that slab was outside the bridge deck and that created a larger 'turning moment', making the slab unstable.  Aftermath  Based on investigations, the Police Inspector of Umra Police Station lodged a first information report (FIR) on 3 July 2014 against 18 accused under section 304 Part II, 337, 338 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code. This included three employees of 'S. N. Bhobe and Associates, Navi Mumbai', five engineers from 'Spectrum Techno Consultant Private Limited,' four directors and three others of 'Rachana Constructions', and three engineers from 'SMC Bridge Cell.' SMC Blacklisted 'S. N. Bhobe and Associates, Navi Mumbai' and transferred the design contract to 'L & T Infrastructure Eng. Ltd'. 'Rachana Construction' was also blacklisted. Subsequently 'Gammon India' was also blacklisted due to them abandoning the incomplete work in November 2014. The remaining bridge construction contract of the Bridge was issued to 'Unique Construction, Surat'. The initial plan was to complete the construction in 30 months, but the collapse of one portion of the 3-Way Interchange Flyover Bridge during construction delayed the project. The Bridge was inaugurated by the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Vijay Rupani, on 2 October 2018, 8 years after starting the construction.

Examples are numerous: disproportionate numbers of spermatozoa during fertilization compared to one egg, large number of neurotransmitters released during neuronal communication compared to the number of receptors, large numbers of released calcium ions during transient in cells and many more in molecular and cellular transduction or gene activation and cell signaling. This redundancy is particularly relevant when the sites of activation is physically separated from the initial position of the molecular messengers. The redundancy is often generated for the purpose of resolving the time constraint of fast-activating pathways. It can be expressed in terms of the theory of extreme statistics to determine its laws and quantify how shortest paths are selected. The main goal is to estimate these large numbers from physical principles and mathematical derivations. When large distance separate the source and the target (a small activation site), the redundancy principle explains that this geometrical gap can be compensated by large number. Had nature used less copies than normal, activation would have taken a much longer time, as finding a small target by chance is a rare events and falls into narrow escape problems.  Molecular rate:  The time for the fastest particles to reach a target in the context of redundancy depends on the numbers and the local geometry of the target. In most of the time, it is the rate of activation. This rate should be used instead of the classical Smoluchowski's rate describing the mean arrival time, but not the fastest. The statistics of the minimal time to activation set kinetic laws in biology, which can be quite different from the ones associated to average times.  Physical models:  Stochatic processes: = The motion of a particle located at position X_t can be described by the Smoluchowski's limit of the Langevin equation: dX_t=\\\\sqrt{2D} \\\\, dB_t+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma}F(x)dt, where D is the diffusion coefficient of the particle, \\\\gamma is the friction coefficient per unit of mass, F(x) the force per unit of mass, and B_t is a Brownian motion. This model is classically used in molecular dynamics simulations. = Jump processes: = \\\\begin{align} x_{n+1}= \\\\begin{cases} x_n-a, & \\\\text{with probability } l(x_n)  x_n+b, & \\\\text{ with probability } r(x_n) \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align}, which is for example a model of telomere length dynamics. Here r(x)=\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\beta x}, , with r(x)+l(x)=1. = Directed motion process: = \\\\dot{X}=v_0 \\\\bf u, where \\\\bf u is a unit vector chosen from a uniform distribution. Upon hitting an obstacle at a boundary point X_0 \\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega, the velocity changes to \\\\dot{X}=v_0 \\\\bf v, where \\\\bf v is chosen on the unit sphere in the supporting half space at X_0 from a uniform distribution, independently of \\\\bf u. This rectilinear with constant velocity is a simplified model of spermatozoon motion in a bounded domain \\\\Omega. Other models can be diffusion on graph, active graph motion.  Mathematical formulation: Computing the rate of arrival time for the fastest  The mathematical analysis of large numbers of molecules, which are obviously redundant in the traditional activation theory, is used to compute the in vivo time scale of stochastic chemical reactions. The computation relies on asymptotics or probabilistic approaches to estimate the mean time of the fastest to reach a small target in various geometries. With N non-interacting i.i.d. Brownian trajectories (ions) in a bounded domain Œ© that bind at a site, the shortest arrival time is by definition \\\\tau^{1}=\\\\min (t_1,\\\\ldots,t_N), where t_i are the independent arrival times of the N ions in the medium. The survival distribution of arrival time of the fastest Pr(\\\\tau^{1}>t) is expressed in terms of a single particle, Pr(\\\\tau^{1}>t)=Pr^N(t_1>t) . Here Pr\\\\\\\\{t_{1}>t \\\\\\\\} is the survival probability of a single particle prior to binding at the target.This probability is computed from the solution of the diffusion equation in a domain \\\\Omega: \\\\frac{\\\\partial p(x,t)}{\\\\partial t} =D \\\\Delta p(x,t) \\\\hbox { for } x \\\\in \\\\Omega, t>0 \\\\begin{align} p(x,0)=&p;_0(x) \\\\hbox{ for } x \\\\in \\\\Omega  \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial n}(x,t) &=0 \\\\hbox{ for } x \\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega_r p(x,t)&=0 \\\\hbox{ for } x \\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega_a, \\\\end{align} where the boundary \\\\partial \\\\Omega contains NR binding sites \\\\partial \\\\Omega_i\\\\subset\\\\partial \\\\Omega (\\\\partial \\\\Omega_a=\\\\bigcup\\\\limits_{i=1}^{N_R}\\\\partial\\\\Omega_i,\\\\ \\\\partial\\\\Omega_r=\\\\partial\\\\Omega-\\\\partial\\\\Omega_a).

The probability \\\\Pr\\\\\\\\{t_{1}>t \\\\\\\\} can be computed using short-time asymptotics of the diffusion equation as shown in the next sections.  Explicit computation in dimension 1  The short-time asymptotic of the diffusion equation is based on the ray method approximation. For an semi-interval [0,\\\\infty[, the survival pdf is solution of \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial (x,t)}{\\\\partial t}& =D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 p(x,t)}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\quad\\\\mbox{ for } x>0,\\\\ t>0  p(x,0)&=\\\\delta(x-a)\\\\quad\\\\mbox{ for }\\\\ x>0,\\\\quad p(0,t)=0\\\\quad\\\\mbox{ for } t>0, \\\\end{align} that isp(x,t) =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4D \\\\pi t}}\\\\left[\\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ - \\\\frac{(x-a)^2}{4Dt}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}- \\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ - \\\\frac{(x+a)^2}{4Dt}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\right].

Arrival times of the fastest in higher dimensions  The arrival times of the fastest among many Brownian motions are expressed in terms of the shortest distance from the source S to the absorbing window A, measured by the distance \\\\delta_{min}=d(S,A),where d is the associated Euclidean distance. Interestingly, trajectories followed by the fastest are as close as possible from the optimal trajectories. In technical language, the associated trajectories of the fastest among N, concentrate near the optimal trajectory (shortest path) when the number N of particles increases. For a diffusion coefficient D and a window of size a, the expected first arrival times of N identically independent distributed Brownian particles initially positioned at the source S are expressed in the following asymptotic formulas : \\\\bar\\\\tau^{d1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\delta^2_{min}}{4D\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{N}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}}\\\\right)}, \\\\hbox{in dim 1, valid for} N \\\\gg1 , \\\\bar \\\\tau^{d2} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\delta^2_{min}}{ 4 D \\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{2}N}{8\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{a}\\\\right)}\\\\right)}, \\\\hbox{ in dim 2 for } \\\\frac{N}{\\\\log (\\\\frac{1}{\\\\epsilon})}\\\\gg1, \\\\bar\\\\tau^{d3} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\delta^2_{min}}{4D{\\\\log\\\\left( N\\\\frac{4a^2}{\\\\pi^{1/2}\\\\delta^2_{min}}\\\\right)}}, \\\\hbox{ in dim } 3, \\\\hbox{ for } \\\\frac{Na^2}{\\\\delta^2_{min}}\\\\gg1. These formulas show that the expected arrival time of the fastest particle is in dimension 1 and 2, O(1/\\\\log(N)). They should be used instead of the classical forward rate in models of activation in biochemical reactions. The method to derive formulas is based on short-time asymptotic and the Green's function representation of the Helmholtz equation. Note that other distributions could lead to other decays with respect N.  Optimal Paths:  Minimizing The optimal path in large N = The optimal paths for the fastest can be found using the Wencell-Freidlin functional in the Large-deviation theory. These paths correspond to the short- time asymptotics of the diffusion equation from a source to a target. In general, the exact solution is hard to find, especially for a space containing various distribution of obstacles. The Wiener integral representation of the pdf for a pure Brownian motion is obtained for a zero drift and diffusion tensor \\\\sigma=D constant, so that it is given by the probability of a sampled path until it exits at the small window \\\\partial\\\\Omega_aat the random time T Pr\\\\\\\\{ x_N(t_{1,M})\\\\in\\\\Omega,{x}_N(t_{2,M})\\\\in\\\\Omega,\\\\dots, x_M(t)=x, t\\\\leq T\\\\leq t+\\\\Delta t x(0)=y\\\\\\\\} =[\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\Omega} \\\\cdots \\\\int\\\\limits\\\\limits_{\\\\Omega}\\\\prod_{j=1}^{M} \\\\frac{d{y}_j}{\\\\sqrt{(2\\\\pi \\\\Delta t)^n\\\\det {\\\\sigma}(x)(t_{j-1,M}))}} \\\\exp \\\\\\\\{ -\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\Delta t} \\\\left[{y}_j-x(t_{j-1,N})- {a}({x}(t_{j-1,N}))\\\\Delta t \\\\right]^T{\\\\sigma}^{-1}(x(t_{j-1,N}))\\\\left[{y}_j-x(t_{j-1,N})-{a}(x(t_{j-1,N}))\\\\Delta t \\\\right]\\\\\\\\} where \\\\Delta t=t/M, t_{j,N}=j\\\\Delta t,\\\\ x(t_{0,N})=y \\\\hbox{ and } {y}_j=x(t_{j,N}) in the product and T is the exit time in the narrow absorbing window \\\\partial\\\\Omega_a. Finally, \\\\langle\\\\tau^{(n)}\\\\rangle=\\\\int\\\\limits\\\\limits_0 ^{\\\\infty}\\\\exp \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ n \\\\log \\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\Omega} p(x,ty)\\\\,dx\\\\right\\\\\\\\} dt =\\\\int_0 ^{\\\\infty} \\\\tau_{\\\\sigma} Pr\\\\\\\\{ \\\\hbox{ Path }\\\\sigma \\\\in S_n (y), \\\\tau_{\\\\sigma}=t \\\\\\\\} dt, where S_n(y) is the ensemble of shortest paths selected among n Brownian trajectories, starting at point y and exiting between time t and t+dt from the domain \\\\Omega. The probabilityPr\\\\\\\\{ \\\\hbox{ Path }\\\\sigma \\\\in S_n \\\\\\\\} is used to show that the empirical stochastic trajectories of S_n concentrate near the shortest paths starting from y and ending at the small absorbing window \\\\partial \\\\Omega_a, under the condition that \\\\epsilon=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Omega_a}{\\\\partial\\\\Omega} \\\\ll 1. The paths of S_n(y) can be approximated using discrete broken lines among a finite number of points and we denote the associated ensemble by \\\\tilde S_n(y). Bayes'rule leads toPr\\\\\\\\{ \\\\hbox{ Path }\\\\sigma \\\\in \\\\tilde S_n(y) t<\\\\tau_{\\\\sigma} where Pr\\\\\\\\{ m \\\\mbox{ steps}\\\\\\\\}=Pr\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mbox{the paths of }\\\\tilde S_n(y) \\\\mbox{exit in m steps} \\\\\\\\} is the probability that a path of \\\\tilde S_n(y) exits in m-discrete time steps. A path made of broken lines (random walk with a time step\\\\Delta t) can be expressed using Wiener path-integral. The probability of a Brownian path x(s) can be expressed in the limit of a path-integral with the functional: Pr\\\\\\\\{ x(s) s\\\\in[0,t] \\\\\\\\} \\\\approx \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\int_{0}^t \\\\dot x^2ds \\\\right). The Survival probability conditioned on starting at y is given by the Wiener representation: S(tx_0)= \\\\int_{x\\\\in \\\\Omega} dx \\\\int_{x(0)}^{x(t)=x} {\\\\mathcal D} (x)\\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\int_{0}^t \\\\dot x^2ds \\\\right), where {\\\\mathcal D} (x) is the limit Wiener measure: the exterior integral is taken over all end points x and the path integral is over all paths starting from x(0). When we consider n-independent paths (\\\\sigma_1,..\\\\sigma_n) (made of points with a time step \\\\Delta t that exit in m-steps, the probability of such an event is Pr \\\\\\\\{ \\\\sigma_1,..\\\\sigma_n \\\\in S_n(y)m, \\\\tau_{\\\\sigma}=m \\\\Delta t \\\\\\\\}= \\\\left(\\\\int\\\\limits_{y_0=y} \\\\cdots \\\\int\\\\limits_{{y}_j \\\\in\\\\Omega} \\\\int\\\\limits_{{y}_n\\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega_a} \\\\frac{1}{(4D\\\\Delta t)^{dm/2}}\\\\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\\\exp \\\\Bigg \\\\\\\\{ -\\\\frac{1}{4D\\\\Delta t} \\\\left[{y}_j-{y}_{j-1})^2 \\\\right] \\\\\\\\} \\\\right)^n\\\\approx \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{(4D\\\\Delta t)^{dm/2}}\\\\right)^n\\\\int_{x} {\\\\mathcal D} (x)\\\\exp \\\\Bigg \\\\\\\\{-n\\\\int\\\\limits_0^{m \\\\Delta t} \\\\dot{x}^2ds \\\\Bigg \\\\\\\\} .Indeed, when there are n paths of m steps, and the fastest one escapes in m-steps, they should all exit in m steps. Using the limit of path integral, we get heuristically the representation Pr \\\\\\\\{ \\\\hbox{ Path }\\\\sigma \\\\in \\\\tilde S_n(y)m, \\\\tau_{\\\\sigma}=m \\\\Delta t \\\\\\\\}= \\\\left(\\\\int\\\\limits_{{y}_0=y} \\\\cdots \\\\int\\\\limits_{{y}_j \\\\in\\\\Omega}\\\\int\\\\limits_{{y}_n\\\\in\\\\partial\\\\Omega_a} \\\\frac{1}{(4D\\\\Delta t)^{dm/2}}\\\\prod_{j=1}^{m} \\\\exp ( -\\\\frac{1}{4D\\\\Delta t} \\\\left[{y}_j-{y}_{j-1})^2 \\\\right])\\\\right)^n \\\\approx \\\\int_{ x \\\\in \\\\Omega } dx \\\\int_{x(0)=y}^{x(t)=x} {D} (x)\\\\exp (-n \\\\int\\\\limits_0^{m \\\\Delta t} \\\\dot{x}^2ds ) , where the integral is taken over all paths starting at y(0) and exiting at time m\\\\Delta t. This formula suggests that when n is large, only the paths that minimize the integrant will contribute. For large n, this formula suggests that paths that will contribute the most are the ones that will minimize the exponent, which allows selecting the paths for which the energy functional is minimal, that is E=\\\\min_{X\\\\in \\\\mathcal P_t}\\\\int\\\\limits_0^T \\\\dot{x}^2ds, where the integration is taken over the ensemble of regular paths\\\\mathcal P_t inside \\\\Omega starting at y and exiting in \\\\partial \\\\Omega_a, defined as \\\\mathcal P_T=\\\\\\\\{ P(0)=y, P(T)\\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega_a \\\\hbox{ and } P(s) \\\\in \\\\Omega \\\\hbox{ and } 0\\\\leq s\\\\leq T\\\\\\\\}. This formal argument shows that the random paths associated to the fastest exit time are concentrated near the shortest paths. Indeed, the Euler-Lagrange equations for the extremal problem are the classical geodesics between y and a point in the narrow window \\\\partial \\\\Omega_a. = Fastest escape from a cusp in two dimensions: = The formula for the fastest escape can generalize to the case where the abosrbing window is located in funnel cusp and the initial particles are distributed outside the cusp. The cusp has a size \\\\epsilon in the opening and a curvature R. The diffusion coefficient is D. The shortest arrival time, valid for large n is given by \\\\tau^{(n)} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2 R^3}{4\\\\epsilon D (\\\\frac{1-\\\\cos(c\\\\sqrt{\\\\tilde \\\\epsilon})}{\\\\tilde\\\\epsilon })^2 \\\\log(\\\\frac{2n}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}})}. Here\\\\tilde \\\\epsilon=\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon}{R}and c is a constant that depends on the diameter of the domain. The time taken by the first arrivers is proportional to the reciprocal of the size of the narrow target \\\\epsilon . This formula is derived for fixed geometry and large n and not in the opposite limit of large n and small epsilon.  Concluding remarks:  How nature set the disproportionate numbers of particles remain unclear, but can be found using the theory of diffusion. One example is the number of neurotransmiters around 2000 to 3000 released during synaptic transmission, that are set to compensate the low copy number of receptors, so the probability of activation is restore to one. In natural processes these large numbers should not be considered wasteful, but are necessary for generating the fastest possible response and make possible rare events that otherwise would never happen. This property is universal, ranging from the molecular scale to the population level. Nature's strategy for optimizing the response time is not necessarily defined by the physics of the motion of an individual particle, but rather by the extreme statistics, that select the shortest paths. In addition, the search for a small activation site selects the particle to arrive first: although these trajectories are rare, they are the ones that set the time scale. We may need to reconsider our estimation toward numbers when punctioning nature in agreement with the redundant principle that quantifies the request to achieve the biological function.

The club was originally founded in 1945 as KSV Temse in the neighbouring town of Temse but following the bankruptcy of K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen in 2020 both clubs merged together to form K.S.C. Lokeren-Temse.Sporting Lokeren wordt na fusie met Temse KSC Lokeren- Temse sporza.be, 22 april 2020, reference in Dutch HistoryTemse= Prior to the second world war, Temse had two official football clubs: Racing Temsche (matricule 807), founded in 1908 and playing in blue and yellow later renamed into FC Temsica; and Temsche SK (matricule 501), founded in 1924 and playing in red and white. The latter club was most successful, playing six seasons in the third division in the 1930s. In 1945, both clubs merged to form a new club KSV Temse (matricule 4297), playing in blue and white and starting in the Belgian Provincial Leagues where it would remain for most of the time before starting to climb back up in the 21st century, reaching the fourth division in 2003 and the third division in 2009 before settling again at the fourth level, now renamed to Belgian Second Amateur Division. =Lokeren= Matricule 282 was given in 1920 to a club named Football Club Racing Club Lokeren (nicknamed Racing FC), but the team stopped its activity the next year. On 22 January 1923 Racing Club Lokeren was founded. Between 1945 and 1951, it had a slight name change (to Racing Athletiek- en Football Club Lokeren) and the new name since 1951 was Koninklijke Racing Club Lokeren. Due to financial problems, the fusion with the other team from the town (Koninklijke Standaard FC Lokeren) became necessary in 1970, with the new club was then named Koninklijke Sporting Club Lokeren, abbreviated to 'KSC Lokeren. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the club participated several times in the UEFA Cup, most notably reaching the quarter-finals in 1981. That year, the club also became runner-up in the league and reached the cup final, losing to Standard Li√®ge. Thereafter the club was less successful but remained at the highest level of Belgian football (except for three seasons in the mid 1990s), mostly finishing mid-table with the best result a third place in 2003. In 2000, the club merged again, now with Koninklijke Sint-Niklaas SKE to form Sporting Lokeren Sint-Niklaas Waasland. The latest name change occurred in 2003, with the province name (Oost-Vlaanderen) added to the club name, to become K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen In 2012 and 2014, Lokeren twice managed to win the Belgian Cup, the second time also followed by a successful campaign in the UEFA Europa League, most notably eliminating Hull City to reach the group stage. In 2019, Lokeren were relegated to the First Division B, the second tier of Belgian football for the first time in nearly 25 years. Later that year, the club was taken over by a group led by Louis de Vries and Alexander Janssen, taking the positions of president and CEO respectively. In April 2020, the club was declared bankrupt during the 2019‚Äì20 season..Sporting Lokeren failliet verklaard - rechtbank stelt curatoren aan hln.be, Yannick De Spiegeleir, 20 april 2020, reference in Dutch Lokeren had outstanding debts of ‚Ç¨5 million and was not able to pay its staff and players anymore, folded as a club and ceased to exist. A few days after the bankruptcy, the club agreed to merge with KSV Temse to form a new club named K.S.V. Lokeren-Temse which will play in the Belgian Second Amateur Division, the national fourth level. The club continues under the matricule of Temse but relocates to the stadium of Lokeren.

Initially demoed by their band Small Faces in 1966, it was given to British singer Chris Farlowe, who released his version as a single in early 1967. It was Farlowe's first single not written by Jagger‚ÄìRichards since 1965's \\"The Fool\\". The Small Faces themselves decided to go on and record a version which was released on two different albums (albeit with minor differences) on two different record labels. The song has since been recorded by multiple other artists, including French rock singer Johnny Hallyday in French as \\"Je N'Ai Jamais Rien Demand√©\\" for his 1967 studio album Johnny 67. The Only Ones recorded a demo in 1975 that was released on their 1984 album Remains. Rock artist Rod Stewart would also go on to cover the track in 1970. Drummer Kenney Jones and keyboardist Ian McLagan appear on Small Faces and Stewart's rendition. Marriott plays on Farlowe's and Small Faces version while Lane appears on Farlowe's, Small Faces and Stewart's versions, becoming the only member of Small Faces to do so.  Chris Farlowe version  Overview = In 1966, Chris Farlowe had achieved a number one single on the UK Singles Chart with the Rolling Stones song \\"Out of Time\\". During this period, he only recorded songs that the Rolling Stones had offered him, starting with \\"Think\\" Of the eleven singles he recorded for Immediate Records, five were Rolling Stones songs. Towards the end of 1966, he'd met rock band Small Faces, who were signed to Decca Records at the time. Steve Marriott, lead singer and guitarist of the group, admired Farlowe, and considered him one of the finest British singers of the era. Marriott had even considered recording an entire album together with him. However, these plans were scrapped, and the Small Faces gave him a song they'd previously recorded as a demo, \\"My Way Of Giving.\\" In a BBC interview, Farlowe claims that Marriott had approached him and asked him to listen to the recording. Farlowe considered it nice and brought it to Mick Jagger, who also voiced his enthusiasm about the track and they decided to record it as a single. The session for it occurred in early 1967, which features both Marriott and Ronnie Lane on guitars and backing vocals, along with Farlowe's backing band the Thunderbirds. Farlowe's version was released on 27 January 1967. The single did not breach the top forty, peaking at number 48. It was one of his final singles to reach the UK singles chart. The last two being \\"Moanin'\\", which reached number 46. Chris Farlowe's last song to chart was ultimately \\"Handbags and Gladrags\\" which reached number 33. The B-Side was \\"You're So Good For Me\\" (alternatively known as \\"You're So Good To Me\\") which was written by Immediate Records founder Andrew Loog Oldham, Andrew Rose and David Skinner (both of british group Twice as Much) and William Bell. = Personnel = * Chris Farlowe ‚Äì lead vocals * Steve Marriott ‚Äì guitars, backing vocals * Ronnie Lane ‚Äì backing vocals *the Thunderbirds ‚Äì backing instrumentation, backing vocals *Mick Jagger ‚Äì producer *Art Greenslade ‚Äì arranger  Small Faces version  Overview = During late 1966, Small Faces had begun experimenting with their sound, and started recording several psychedelic compositions, including \\"(Tell Me) Have You Ever Seen Me?\\" \\"Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow\\", \\"My Mind's Eye\\" and \\"That Man\\", after a party in which they were introduced to orange slices spiked with LSD. However, an additional track they started writing around this period was \\"My Way of Giving\\". They were signed with Decca Records during this period, with Don Arden as their manager and producer. However, their relation with the label had begun growing sour, after several incidents, including the unauthorized release of \\"My Mind's Eye\\" as a single in late 1966. They split up with Decca after Don Arden attempted to tell their parents regarding their drug use. Almost immediately after, Small Faces signed Immediate Records, who granted them much more studio time. Two versions of the song exist. One of them was released on the Decca compilation album From the Beginning during the earlier parts of June 1967. The second, \\"official\\" version was released on their eponymous second studio album Small Faces on 23 June 1967. The reason behind this is that when Small Faces was announced, Decca Records and Don Arden compiled an album of various leftovers that the Small Faces recorded for Decca, which included \\"My Way Of Giving.\\" The main difference is that the Decca recording has an alternate vocal take, both by Marriott and Lane, who in that version adds the line \\"Don't Worry Baby\\" in between a couple of verses (which is also included on the Farlowe version). This is ommited from the Immediate version. While the Decca version exists solely in mono, the Immediate version was released in both mono and stereo, with the instrumental backing panned to the left, with a guitar overdub and vocals appearing in the right channel. Both versions utilize the same backing track. \\"My Way of Giving\\" was one of two songs that appears on both From the Beginning and Small Faces. The other is \\"(Tell Me) Have You Ever Seen Me?\\" which did not use the same backing track on the Immediate version. In the US, the song was first issued on 17 March 1968, on There Are But Four Small Faces which compiled various singles along with tracks from Small Faces.Here Comes The Nice: Immediate Years box set 1967-69, liner notes, page 68 The song is considered a major factor in the writing partnership between Marriott and Lane. It is also considered one of Small Faces best compositions of all times. Strangely, it is not featured on Here Come The Nice: Immediate Years box set 1967-69 which compiled all recordings from the Immediate era. \\"My Way of Giving\\" was issued as the B-Side of the re-issue of \\"Itchycoo Park\\" on 28 November 1975, which reached number nine in the UK charts. = Personnel = * Steve Marriott ‚Äì lead vocals, backing vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar *Ronnie Lane ‚Äì backing vocals, bass guitar *Ian McLagan ‚Äì backing vocals, Hammond organ, piano *Kenney Jones ‚Äì drums  Rod Stewart version  Overview = In 1970, british rock singer Rod Stewart recorded the song for his studio album Gasoline Alley. Stewart, who at the time was a member of Faces, the successor of Small Faces, had been critical of the original Small Faces recording. He had called it \\"monstrous\\" in a ZigZag interview. This was most likely due to the fact that Marriott had recently left Small Faces, and been replaced by Stewart and Ronnie Wood, formerly of the Jeff Beck Group. In comparison to the Small Faces version (which is relatively short, clocking in at a mere two minutes), Stewart's rendition of the track is a long, drawn out ballad heavily featuring Ian McLagan on his signature Hammond organ. It features members of the Faces, providing backing instrumentals, along with Lane, who also provides backing vocals to the track. It was first released on Gasoline Alley, which was his second solo studio album on 12 June 1970. In a positive retrospective review by AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, he claims that Stewart claims the track for himself. = Personnel = * Rod Stewart ‚Äì lead vocals * Ronnie Lane ‚Äì bass guitar, backing vocals * Ronnie Wood ‚Äì lead guitar * Ian McLagan ‚Äì Hammond organ * Kenney Jones ‚Äì drums  References  External links  Small Faces official website Category:1967 songs Category:1967 singles Category:Immediate Records singles Category:Small Faces songs Category:Songs written by Ronnie Lane Category:Songs written by Steve Marriott Category:Rod Stewart songs Category:The Only Ones songs Category:Chris Farlowe songs Category:Johnny Hallyday songs ","title":"My Way of Giving"},{"id":"64043082","text":"Antonio Bonet Correa (20 October 1925 ‚Äì May 22, 2020) was a Spanish art historian.

The communal garden at the centre of the development is in size and was previously the site of tennis club and courts. The square was developed on the site of the 190 acre Earl's Court Farm, which had been farmed by the descendants of Samuel Hutchins since 1720. The development is named for Philbeach, a village in the Pembrokeshire parish of Marloes on the west coast of Wales. The 1st Baron Kensington, William Edwardes, had married Elizabeth Warren of Longbridge, Pembrokeshire and their only son became the 2nd Baron Kensington. The precarious finances of the 2nd and 3rd Baron Kensington precluded the development of the estate until the late 19th century. In 1875 an application was made to the Metropolitan Board of Works by Martin Stutely the surveyor of Lord Kensington's estates, to create the roadway of Philbeach Gardens. The builder George Mineard began building by 1876. Mineard's previous developments had included Cluny Mews and parts of Warwick Road. 1-31, 64-73 and 89-110 Philbeach Gardens had been built by 1882, in the Italianate style. 88 Philbeach Gardens was built in the red- brick Domestic Revival style which was used for the rest of the development. It is the only double fronted house in Philbeach Gardens. The average price of a property in Philbeach Gardens was ¬£720,000 in 2020. The musician Michael Howard rented a maisonette in a \\"decayed terrace\\" in Philbeach Gardens in the late 1940s. Mario Vargas Llosa lived in Philbeach Gardens in 1967. St Cuthbert's, Earls Court is located at No. 50 Philbeach Gardens. Michael McNay, writing in his Hidden Treasures of London describes Philbeach Gardens as a \\"big crescent embracing impressive parkland\\". The civil servant and inventor Henry Cole first rented in Philbeach Gardens and then later bought a property there. Cole was attracted to the area because of his concern with the danger of sewer gas, having been impressed by builder George Mineard's ventilation system to mitigate the dangers of gas. Mineard and Cole established the \\"Fifth of November Club\\" which held firework displays from the gardens. An armed siege took place on Philbeach Gardens between 20 and 22 March 1985. The perpetrator, James Alexander Baigrie, had escaped from prison in Edinburgh where he was serving a life sentence for murder. Baigrie killed himself with a sawn off shotgun in the van after a siege lasting 44 hours.

It is a Dalit-dominated village which was in the dark even after 69 years of Independence. With no electricity network, the natives had to cover distances to nearby electrified villages. The villagers had to walk miles to charge their cell phones, what to speak of lighting and fans. They village was finally received light with Oorja, a London based social enterprise, launched its 8 kW solar mini grid. Electrification of Village Due to the efforts of Clementine Chambon, who is a student from Imperial College, London, the United Kingdom. A final-year student of PhD has helped village with Oorja. Oorja promotes sustainable local economic development, and aims to give clean energy to almost 450 million people who have no access to reliable electricity in rural India. The mini solar grid provides energy-affordable lighting, charging phones and running fans in homes. Oorja Clementine Chambon with her colleague, Indian social entrepreneur Amit Saraogi founded Oorja in the year 2015. The organization gives economical and reliable power to rural communities in India that are currently not connected to the country's national energy grid network. By doing this, it could provide a larger distribution of electricity to power small enterprises that includes water purification stations, sewing cooperatives, and grain mills in the village. The team at Oorja then also planned to increase more financial to enable them to roll out some more mini- grids to other villages in 2018. Demographic The majority of the population in Sarvantara is farmers and relies on agriculture for their livelihoods. Due to Oorja, the farmers will get fuel for productivity. The renewable energy generated will also benefits power pumps to give irrigation services to farmers. This will also provide a significant cost savings compared to diesel-powered pumps.

She is the Oliver H. Radkey Regents Professor of History at The University of Texas at Austin, where she is also a Fellow of Walter Prescott Webb Chair in History and the George W. Littlefield Professorship in American History. In 2019 she became the Associate Dean of The Graduate School at The University of Texas at Austin. She studies gender and slavery, as well as Black women's history in the United States. She has written books about the connection between the idea of skilled work and the gender of enslaved people in antebellum Georgia, the economic history of slavery in the United States, and the historical contributions of African American women to the politics and governance of the United States and to securing their own rights. Education and positions Berry attended the University of California, Los Angeles, where she graduated with a BA in history in 1992. She continued to study at the University of California, Los Angeles as a graduate student. In 1994 she obtained an MA in African American Studies, and in 1998 she received a PhD in United States History. In 1998, Berry became a professor of history and African American Studies at Arizona State University. In 2000, she joined the history faculty at Michigan State University, and in 2010 she moved to the University of Texas at Austin, where she has been affiliated with the history department and the department of African and African Diaspora Studies. In 2018 she was named Oliver H. Radkey Regents Professor of History, and in 2019 she became Associate Dean of The Graduate School at the University of Texas at Austin. Research Berry published her first book, Swing the Sickle for the Harvest is Ripe: Gender and Slavery in Antebellum Georgia, in 2007. Through a comparison of Glynn County, Georgia and Wilkes County, Georgia during the early 19th century, Berry studies the relationship between the idea of skilled labor and gender in understanding enslaved peoples' work, and more broadly she examines the relationship between enslaved peoples' labor and their family and community relations. She contrasts the effects of the more closed system in Glynn County, which was more restrictive for the mobility of enslaved people but reinforced stronger and more stable family bonds, with the more open system of Wilkes County. She describes these systems through a detailed social and economic micro-history of the two counties. In 2017, Berry published the book The Price for their Pound of Flesh: The Value of the Enslaved, from Womb to Grave, in the Building of a Nation. In The Price for their Pound of Flesh, Berry studies the economic history of slavery in the United States, examining how a price was assigned to the bodies of enslaved people in America from before they were born until after they died. Berry proposes four types of value that an enslaved person could hold: their assessed value, as determined by others for the purposes of accounting and sale; their market value, which was a function of local demand; their soul value, derived from inherent spiritual self-worth and reinforced by familial and communal connections; and their ghost value, evaluated by body brokers who engaged in the sale of human cadavers. Through this categorisation scheme, Berry is able to produce an economic history which is not completely centered around the market. Rather, by including the inherent self-value that many enslaved people held through the idea of soul value, Berry also produces an intellectual history of the thoughts, emotions, and ideas of enslaved people when considering their own value. This makes the book a work of both economic history and social history. Berry's focus on the factors that produced assigned value, as well as the value of unborn slaves, also makes a contribution to the historical literature on the violent role of gender and reproduction in the systems of American slavery. In 2020, Berry published the book A Black Women's History of the United States with coauthor Kali Nicole Gross. The book examines the history of African American women through the narratives of eleven women who either had a significant impact on the history of the United States or whose lives reflect something about Black women's lives in American history. Two theses of the book are that African American women have been under-recognised for their core role in American history, and that the rights that have been won by African American women were gained primarily through their own struggle and activism. Specifically, Berry and Gross argue that political acts by African American women have crucially clarified the idea of liberty in American politics, exposed failures in mainstream approaches to democracy, and demonstrated how to correct those failures. Berry and Gross selected stories about historical figures who are not well-known, in what was described in Kirkus Reviews as a \\"wide-ranging search-and-rescue mission for black female activists, trailblazers, and others who have left a mark\\". A Black Women's History of the United States was listed as one of \\"the 10 books to read in February\\" of 2019 by The Washington Post, as well as one of \\"the 22 most anticipated books of February 2020\\" by Bustle magazine. Berry was a co-editor of two more books: Slavery and Freedom in Savannah (2014) and Sexuality & Slavery: Reclaiming Intimate Histories in the Americas (2018).

The break-up of the supercontinent Gondwana resulted in a series of large volcanic eruptions, but EQUAMP is the only Gondwanan LIP composed exclusively of intrusive rock, making it a Large Plutonic Province (LPP). During the Pan-African-Brasiliano orogenies the S√£o Francisco-Congo craton collided with the West African craton to form the Borborema Province in northeastern Brazil. Neoproterozoic shear zones divide this province into terranes that merged during the formation of West Gondwana (South America and Africa). Intracontinental rifts developed in the early Palaeozoic and when the central Atlantic opened during the late Mesozoic dike swarms and sills were emplaced, including the hundreds of kilometres long Rio Cear√°-Mirim dike swarm. These dikes have been dated to 145‚Äì110 . On the Amazonian craton west of the Borborema Province, a sedimentary basin, the Parna√≠ba Basin, covers the shear zones and dikes and partially hides two major magmatic events: the older flood basalts related to the 200 Ma Central Atlantic Magmatic Province and a set of younger sills and dikes. The 135 Ma Paran√°-Etendeka LIP was emplaced during the opening of the South Atlantic and resulted in the Walvis Ridge-Rio Grande Rise hotspot trail. Even though the EQUAMP and Paran√°-Etendeka formed under similar circumstances and are roughly coeval, their distinct geochemical compositions indicates different mantle sources for the two events.

Toponymy  Formerly, the snowshoe hare was widespread in the Richelieu valley notably by its capacity of reproduction and its capacity to survive the harsh winters. The woods of the island proved to be a certain refuge from its natural predators. Given the proximity of the town of Chambly, some residents used to come to √éle aux Li√®vres to trap the hare using snares or gun hunting.Toponymic itinerary of Vall√©e-du -Richelieu, 1984.

It chronicles McGuinness's life, his time as a player and his time in charge of the county under-21s and, subsequently, his four-year spell in charge of the seniors. Content McGuinness described his arrival to take charge of the under-21 team that would later contest the final of the 2010 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship: \\"I held up a photograph of the Cork U21 team that had won the All-Ireland and told the players that this is who we are going to be. James Carroll gave a laugh. He wasn't being respectful, it just sounded outlandish to him. It sounded daft to them all. And I lit up, not at James but at the mentality\\". McGuinness also chronicled his four-year spell in charge of the senior team, which he led to three Ulster Senior Football Championships and the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. One of the players whose performances greatly improved under McGuinness was Ryan Bradley: As McGuinness described it in the book: \\"Ryan ran the roads seven days a week. He went out running when every muscle in his body was screaming for rest. Usually he put up eight or ten kilometres in the morning so he could burn fat. And he went from fifteen and a half stone to thirteen stone six\\". McGuinness cited his assistant Rory Gallagher as being to blame for Donegal's early exit from the 2013 Championship. He mentioned in particular an interview Gallagher gave to a newspaper three days before the 2013 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship quarter-final defeat to Mayo, in which Gallagher claimed Mayo and Monaghan were in \\"collusion\\" against Donegal. McGuinness wrote: \\"This could only serve to provoke Mayo - and they were still smarting from the previous year's All- Ireland final. He tried to tell me afterwards that the conversation had been off the record. I found that hard to believe, so I spoke to the journalist involved and he refuted the claim. I couldn't figure what Rory's thinking was\\". Gallagher parted ways with McGuinness following this defeat. According to Until Victory Always (published in 2015), McGuinness had not spoken to Gallagher since that game. Publication The book's title and other details were revealed in June 2015, with a release date of 23 October also announced. Until Victory Always was released in October 2015. McGuinness launched it in his native Glenties on 29 October 2015. Then, on the following night, gave a televised interview to The Late Late Show to promote the book. Reception Rory Gallagher, who succeeded McGuinness as manager and was in charge of the county at the time of the book's publication, disputed McGuinness's account of the disagreement that led to Gallagher's departure as his assistant in 2013. Donegal manager Gallagher released a statement addressing the issue. Until Victory Always won the 2015 Sports Book of the Year at the Irish Book Awards.

During the development of the missile the Ababil-100 had already been declared and Iraq later on admitted to hiding its Fahd missile project with the Ababil-100 as similarities would be observed between J-1 and Ababil-100. Iraq had declared the project abandoned in May 1993 and had had six tests between January and April of 1993 and provided UNSCOM details. Iraq had declared the range to be 134 km but UNSCOM could not verify it.

Skulachenko served with armored car units of the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and commanded them during the Russian Civil War. He served in staff and command positions during the 1920s and 1930s, and commanded the 31st Mechanized Brigade during the early 1930s. His last post before being arrested was commander of the armored and mechanized forces of the Kharkov Military District.  Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War  Variously described as of either Russian or Ukrainian ethnicity in documents. Skulachenko was born to a peasant family on 13 June 1895 in the village of Mikulino in Smolensk Governorate. He graduated from the village school in 1907, three grades of a four-grade vocational school in 1910, and a technical school in 1912, working as a lathe operator. Drafted into the Imperial Russian Army in January 1916, Skulachenko graduated from a training detachment and became a senior uniter-ofitser in the 1st Anti- Aircraft Auto Company, fighting in the Caucasus campaign, and was wounded in action in 1917. Joining the Communist Party that year, Skulachenko distributed Bolshevik leaflets after the February Revolution. He served as chief of a truck platoon of the 1st Reserve Auto Company in Petrograd from 6 August of that year. In September, Skulachenko became commander of the 3rd Armored Car Detachment, and was wounded during the October Revolution. His unit guarded the Smolny Institute in October. As the Russian Civil War began, Skulachenko joined the Red Army in January 1918, becoming commander of the 2nd Caucasian Auto Company. He fought in the war on the Eastern, Southern, and Caucasian Fronts and was twice wounded and concussed. After commanding the international company of the Petrograd military commissariat between September and December 1918, Skulachenko studied at the Military-Political Course for Agitators and Instructors, which he completed in March 1919. Assigned as an agitator in the 11th Army upon graduation, Skulachenko became political commissar of the 1st Artillery Battalion in the same month. For a week in January 1920 he served as an auto mechanic at the Arkhangelsk Military Port before becoming commissar of the 4th Artillery Battalion. In May, he became commissar of the armored car detachment of the 11th Army, then commander and commissar of the 55th Armored Detachment.  Interwar period  After serving as acting commissar of the engineering depot of the supply department of the 11th Army from January 1921, Skulachenko was sent to study at the Military Academy of the Red Army in November of that year. After graduating from the academy, he was posted to the North Caucasus Military District as a company commander in October 1925 to gain practical experience. In the district, Skulachenko became chief of staff of the 221st Rifle Regiment of the 74th Rifle Division in November 1926 before transferring to the Leningrad Military District to serve as chief of the operational section of the staff of the 43rd Rifle Division in March 1928. In December 1929, Skulachenko briefly served as assistant chief of the 4th department of the 2nd Directorate of the Staff of the Red Army, but in January 1930 returned to the Leningrad Military District as commander and commissar of the motorized armored detachment of the 11th Rifle Division. A year later, he took command of the Mechanized Regiment of the OGPU Troops, and in May 1932 returned to the army as commander and commissar of a mechanized brigade of the Leningrad Mechanized Corps (reorganized from the 11th Rifle Division), which became the 31st Mechanized Brigade. Briefly at the disposal of the Personnel Directorate from February 1935, Skulachenko became chief of the armored forces of the Kharkov Military District in June of that year, being promoted to kombrig when the Red Army introduced personal military ranks that year. In April 1937 he was placed at the disposal of the Personnel Directorate and transferred to the reserve on 29 July for \\"political unreliablity\\" before being arrested on 3 August. Sentenced to death on 5 October for participating in a nonexistent \\"military conspiracy\\", Skulachenko was specifically charged with carrying out an act of sabotage (a 'diversionary act') in a armor depot of the district in late 1936 and preparing to burn a repair workshop in February 1937. Skulachenko was executed on the next day. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 13 June 1956 under De-Stalinization.

Formed in 1940 as the 2d Defense Battalion, its original mission was to provide air and coastal defense for advanced naval bases. During the war the battalion defended Hawaii, Tutuila in American Samoa and Guam and took part in combat operations at Tarawa Atoll and Okinawa. The battalion returned to the United States after the war and was decommissioned at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California on 28 November 1945. HistoryWorld War II= The 2d Defense Battalion was commissioned on 1 March 1940 at San Diego, California. Lieutenant Colonel Bertram A. Bone was the first commanding officer of the battalion. Because of the Marine Corps' rapid growth beginning in 1939, there was a great deal of movement amongst leadership as the institution struggled to keep pace. This led to the battalion having five commanding officers by the time the war began in December 1941. The battalion was the only defense battalion still stateside when war broke out. They deployed to Hawaii in December 1941 and quickly prepared for follow on tasking. The battalion arrived in American Samoa in January 1942 to assist the 7th Defense Battalion with air and coastal defense of the region. In November 1943 the 2d Defense Battalion was assigned to the V Amphibious Corps for the Battle of Tarawa. They came ashore on 23 November after most of the battle was complete in order to garrison the island against Japanese counterattack from the air. For this operation the battalion was reinforced by one half of the 2d Airdrome Battalion which came in from the Ellice Islands. Following operations at Tarawa the battalion also served on Guam and was again moved to Hawaii. As the war progressed, the Marine Corps removed coastal artillery from the defense battalions in order to form additional heavy artillery units for the Fleet Marine Force. Because of the divestiture of the coastal defense mission, the battalion was redesignated as the 2d Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion on 16 April 1944 while on Kauai. The 2d AAA Battalion was one of four AAA battalions that comprised the 1st Provisional AAA Group during the Battle of Okinawa.

Dineen wrote most of the band's music, and developed an angular guitar style influenced by The Mekons, The Fire Engines and Gang of Four. Nun Attax / Five Go Down To The Sea? were active between 1978 and 1985 and released three EPs; Knot a Fish (1983), The Glee Club (1984), and Singing in Braille (1985). His career highlight came in June 1989 when he reformed with FGDTS vocalist Finbarr Donnelly as Beethoven (also known as \\"Beethoven Fucking Beethoven\\") for the EP Him Goolie Goolie Man, Dem, which was featured as \\"Single of the Week\\" by the NME in 4 June 1989. The band's success was cut short when Donnelly accidentally drowned on the 18th of that month. Afterwards Dineen returned to Cork, where he still lives. Five Go Down To The Sea? were hugely influential on later generations of Irish bands and are widely credited for the often quirky and deadpan approach of Cork bands that followed in the 1990s and 2000s. Dineen currently writes for and plays guitar with Big Boy Foolish. CareerNun Attax / Five Go Down to the Sea?= Dineen grew up in Churchfield in Cork City. He formed a band in 1978 with school friends Philip and Keith O‚ÄôConnell. He met vocalist Finbarr Donnelly in 1978, when they bonded over a shared interest in UFOs and music. Until then Dineen had been a hard rock and Pink Floyd fan; Donnelly introduced him to post-punk and bands featured on John Peel's BBC radio show. Dineen has been active on the post punk scene since 1978, during which time he has recorded for Reekus Records, Kabuki Records, Abstract Sounds and Creation Records. Nun Attax developed an early live following in Ireland, becoming scene leaders in the punk movement that grew around the Arcadia ballroom, managed by Elvera Butler and Andy Foster. In 1981 three of their songs were featured on the live compilation album Kaught at the Kampus, alongside tracks by Microdisney, Mean Features and Urban Blitz. The album was recorded on 30 August 1980, and released by Reekus Records. In 1983 they renamed as Five Go Down to the Sea? and recruited √öna N√≠ Chanainn on cello to play the bass parts. The band's sound changed significantly around this time, moving away from their punk roots towards a more Captain Beefheart and surreal sound. They recorded their most acclaimed EP Knot a Fish later that year. It was described in 2001 by Cathal Coughlan of Microdisney and The Fatima Mansions sas \\"was just incredible...completely different to Nun Attax...it wasn't like a rock band anymore, it was...bizarre but coherent. Nothing when on for longer than two and a half minutes...[it was] a completely focused attack of extreme Cork eccentricity.\\" The band moved to London that winter, where they built a live following across England. They released two further EPs, The Glee Club (Abstract Sounds, 1984) and Singing in Braille (Creation, 1984). Dineen was unhappy with the Creation recording and said in 2014 that while he liked the Foster, the band was trying to do something that they weren't suited to and that they \\"were trying to be over the top a bit...and it was a disappointment\\". The band went into hiatus in 1985, although Dineen and Donnelly stayed in London and played a number of gigs with a drum machine early in 1986, but without industry interest. =Beethoven= The two reformed as Beethoven (at first know as \\"Beethoven Fucking Beethoven\\") in 1988 and released the Him Goolie Goolie Man, Dem EP on Setanta Records the following year. In his review for the NME, writer Steven Wells awarded the record ‚ÄúSingle of the Week‚Äù, and said that \\"The centrestone of this jewel of a record is the kidnapping, tarring and feathering, mugging, shagging and destruction of \\"Day Tripper\\". Before they could build on this success, Donnelly accidentally drowned 18 June 1989 while swimming in Hyde Park's Serpentine Pond, aged 27. Dineen had been out with him that day, and they had planned to meet up later in the evening. He later said, \\"If you went out for the craic with your friends on a Sunday afternoon and one of them didn't come back, it's surreal-like. Even though we were both 27, you're still young. It changes your whole life because we went from planning our future, thinking we were going to be in England for a while, to the next minute being on the flight back to Ireland.\\" Their planned second single was never released. Grief stricken and with the band at a sudden end, Dineen returned to Cork shortly afterwards, where he \\"drank [his] way though the 1990s\\" until his career revived in the early 2000s. =Big Boy Foolish= Dineen currently plays guitar in Big Boy Foolish with guitarist and vocalist Liam Heffernan, and in the occasional Five Go Down To The Sea? memorial band And NUN Came Back,\\"Cyprus Avenue, Caroline St. Donnelly - 30th Anniversary Retrospective 8pm, adm ‚Ç¨10\\".

Harris is an American historian and scholar of African American Studies. She is a professor of History and African American Studies at Northwestern University. Harris studies the history of African Americans in the United States. She has published work on the history of slavery in New York City, on slavery, gender and sexuality in the Antebellum South, and on the historiography of slavery in the United States. Education and positions Harris attended Columbia University, where she graduated in 1988 with a BA degree, majoring in American History and minoring in literature. In 1993 she obtained an MA degree in American History at Stanford University, followed by a PhD in 1995 in American History with a secondary focus on African History and a tertiary focus on Humanities. From 1994 to 1995, Harris was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park. In 1995, she became a professor of history at Emory University. She remained at Emory until 2016. Beginning in 2003, Harris was also affiliated with the department of African American Studies at Emory, where she served as the Chair for multiple years. She was also a co-founder and director of the Transforming Community Project at Emory. In 2011 Harris was awarded a Winship Distinguished Research Professorship in the Humanities, which recognizes \\"tenured faculty who demonstrate singular accomplishments in research\\". In 2016, she moved to Northwestern University, where she became a professor in the departments of history and African American studies. Harris was chosen as the 2020‚Äì2021 Beatrice Shepherd Blane Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, to work on a book studying Hurricane Katrina in the context of family history and climate change. Research In 2003, Harris published In the Shadow of Slavery: African Americans in New York City, 1626-1863. Harris studies the history of slavery in New York City throughout the 17th, 18th, and especially the 19th centuries, with a focus on the 1830s and 1840s. She particularly focuses on the city's Black voluntary associations, which began as informal networks organized around purposes like mutual aid and mechanical or literary instruction, and evolved into formal institutions that helped structure the lives of African American residents of the city. In the Shadow of Slavery won the 2003 Wesley-Logan Prize from the American Historical Association and the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, which is \\"awarded annually for an outstanding book in African diaspora history\\". In 2005, she co-edited the book Slavery in New York with Ira Berlin, which accompanied an exhibition on Slavery in New York by the New-York Historical Society. In 2011, Harris organized the first ever conference on slavery and the university, which was held at Emory University. This conference was the originator of several pieces in a book that Harris co-edited with James T. Campbell and Alfred L. Brophy, called Slavery and the University: Histories and Legacies and published in 2019. The chapters of Slavery and the University study the history of American higher education, and higher education in contemporary America, in light of revelations about universities and slavery. Harris has also co-edited two books with Daina Ramey Berry. The first of these was Slavery and Freedom in Savannah, published in 2014. In collaboration with the Telfair Museums preservation of the slave quarters at the Owens‚ÄìThomas House, the chapters in the volume study urban slavery in antebellum Georgia and aim to place urban slavery in the broader context of southern American slavery. The book focuses on Savannah, Georgia both as an integral part of the staple crop production of the surrounding rural areas as well as a distinctive area with somewhat different social systems. Though Slavery and Freedom in Savannah begins with a study of the founding of the Province of Georgia in the mid-1700s and largely focuses on studying slavery in Savannah, it also studies the ramifications of these systems as late as the era of the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-1900s. Harris and Berry also co-edited the 2018 book Sexuality and Slavery: Reclaiming Intimate Histories in the Americas, a collection that E. R. Crowther wrote uses the small amount of evidence that is available on the topic to understand \\"how intimacy and sexuality operated in the cruel world of slavery\\". Harris has engaged in substantial public education regarding African American history. She was one of the historians who was consulted on The 1619 Project for The New York Times. Harris has written that mistakes were made in that project and falsehoods were avoidably published, but also that the project was overall a \\"much-needed corrective to the blindly celebratory histories that once dominated our understanding of the past\\", with overstated claims allowing critics to \\"use the overstated claim to discredit the entire undertaking\\".

They are raped and physically and psychologically harmed in locations within these administrative divisions. Sex trafficking in El Salvador is human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation and slavery that occurs in the Republic of El Salvador. It is a country of origin, transit, and destination for sexually trafficked persons. El Salvador citizens and foregienrs, primarily women and girls, are sex trafficked to the different departments of El Salvador, as well as other countries, namely Mexico and the United States. The illegal transporting and sexual assault of migrants from Latin America to the United States is a problem. The majority of foreign victims of sex trafficking in El Salvador come from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. Children, deported migrants, and people in poverty are especially vulnerable to sex trafficking. Incidents have involved child pornography and sex tourism. Sex trafficked victims are deceived or abducted and forced into prostitution and unfree labour. They are guarded or locked up in brothels, homes, and other locations. Some are forced into marriages or pregnancies, and victims' babies have been sold. They are threatened and physically and psychologically abused. Victims have been tortured and murdered. Their family members are sometimes threatened. Victims contract sexually transmitted diseases from rapes without condoms. They have been deprived of water and other necessities and often live in poor and dirty conditions. A number are drugged while in captivity. Others are forced to get tattoos or breast implants. Victims experience mental health problems, including depression, suicidal thoughts, and persecutory delusions. Victims have participated in investigations and trials against their traffickers. Sex crimes against women and girls, such as these, are a form of gender inequality in El Salvador. Sex trafficking and exploitation have permeated all levels of Salvadorian society. Traffickers have been male and female. A number of traffickers are members of or facilitated by gangs and transnational criminal organizations. Government officials and workers and police have been complicit and corruption and impunity are issues. Anti-sex trafficking efforts in the country have been criticized for being unsatisfactory. The scale of sex trafficking in El Salvador is not known because of the dearth of data. Government anti-sex trafficking efforts and protections for citizens have been criticized for being insufficient. Law enforcement is hindered by limited operating budgets and resources. Victim care and rehabilitation programmes are lacking. Links to illegal drug trade Drug gangs in El Salvador engage in sex trafficking as an alternative source of profit. Women and girls have been forced into sexual relationships and kept as sex slaves by gang leaders. Non-governmental organization Ram√° Network, part of the International Network of Consecrated Life Against Trafficking in Persons, and the Association for the Self-Determination of Salvadoran Women (AMS) carry out anti-sex trafficking efforts in El Salvador.

Life  James Sibbald was of an ancient family in the Mearns. His birth, about 1595, may be inferred from his being on ordination trials with the presbytery of Deer on 28 Oct. 1613. He matriculated at Marischal College, Aberdeen in 1614. He graduated MA in 1618 and he became a regent, and prelected on philosophy. In 1626 he was admitted to the first charge in St. Nicholas' Church, Aberdeen. He graduated B.D. at Marischal College on 14 Oct. 1630, and before 1637 received the degree of D.D. from the two universities of Marischal College and King's College. His first appearance in ecclesiastical politics is in connection with the unifying schemes of John Durie (1596‚Äì1680). By advice of Archbishop Spotiswood, Durie had written to Aberdeen divines, seeking their opinion on the points of dispute between the Lutherans and the Reformed. On 20 Feb. 1637 Sibbald and five other Aberdeen doctors, headed by John Forbes (1593‚Äì1648), gave it as their judgment that Lutherans and Reformed agreed in those points on which the ancient church had been of one opinion. The harmonising attempt was approved by Robert Baillie, D.D.; by Samuel Rutherford it was denounced as a design for \\"reconciliation with popery\\". On the arrival in Aberdeen (20 July 1638) of the deputation, charged with the task of procuring adhesion to the \\"national covenant\\" of 28 Feb. (drafted by Alexander Henderson, (1583?‚Äì1646)), the same six doctors, with the temporising adhesion of William Guild, presented further \\"demands,\\" questioning the lawfulness of the covenant. Answers, replies, further answers and \\"duplies,\\" brought the negotiation to a deadlock. Sibbald had been elected to the general assembly which opened at Glasgow on 21 Nov. He did not attend. On 28 March 1639, four days before the reduction of Aberdeen by the covenanting forces under Montrose, he sailed for Berwick with Robert Baron (1593?‚Äì1639), other leaders of his party, and a small armed force, for the service of the king. They were coldly received. Sibbald returned to Aberdeen in August, and resumed his ministry on 13 Oct., practically accepting the situation, but resolutely declining to subscribe the \\"national covenant.\\" On 22 Dec. he admonished his parishioners not to keep Christmas Day, this being forbidden by ecclesiastical authority (Act of Assembly, 10 Dec. 1638). On 24 May 1640 he was silenced by commission of assembly; on 7 July he was suspended till the meeting of assembly. On 6 Aug. he was deposed by the general assembly meeting at Aberdeen. In addition to his refusal of the covenant, he was charged with Arminianism and with doctrines tending to popery, a charge partly grounded on his circulation of the (unpublished) writings of William Forbes. Under examination, he maintained the regeneration of all baptised infants; and while admitting the pope to be antichrist, he \\"knew not whether a greater antichrist would arise after him.\\" His books and papers were seized, but returned to him. In October he again sailed for England, but returned to Aberdeen at the beginning of 1641, having received no encouragement from the king. He made his way to Ireland, and obtained some ministerial charge in Dublin. He was probably the \\"Ja. Sybold\\" who joined (August 1646) in the address to Ormonde, thanking him for \\"the free exercise of the true reformed religion according to the liturgy and canons of the church,\\" and who signed (9 July 1647) the \\"declaration\\" maintaining that the directory was without royal authority, and seeking permission \\"to use the Book of Common Prayer.\\" Grub doubts whether he was the Dr. Sibbald who attended Hamilton on the scaffold in Palace Yard, Westminster (9 March 1649), on the ground that the divines then in attendance are described as presbyterians. But this term is not inapplicable to Sibbald, a Scottish churchman, strongly attached to primitive doctrine, but accepting the ecclesiastical arrangements made by lawful authority. Ten years after leaving Aberdeen he died in Dublin of the plague, in 1647. He married Elizabeth Nicolson, and had issue. The Scottish parliament on 21 June 1661 granted ¬£200 to his widow and children.  Works  * Theses Theologic√¶ de primatu B.

It was situated in the southern part of the modern Netherlands and in the northern part of present- day Belgium, currently known as Campine (Kempen in Dutch).  Name  The tribal name Texandri, which may be related to the region, is mentioned as Texand(ri) by an inscription dated 100‚Äì225 AD, as Texuandri by Pliny (1st c. AD),Pliny. Naturalis Historia, 4:106 and perhaps as Texu<...> on an inscription from Romania dated 102/103 AD. The variant form Toxiandria is only attested once in a 9th-century manuscript of Ammianus Marcellinus' Res Gestae (ca. 390) to designate the region, and the variant Taxandria occurs five times in 9th-century sources, and also in later documents. The inconsistencies in spelling may be explained by dittography (errors by copyists), or by the fact that the old form Texandri had fallen out of usage. The name Texandria is generally assumed to stem from the Proto-Germanic root *tehsw≈ç(n)- ('right [hand], south'; compare with Old Saxon tesewa, Gothic taihswa, 'right, south') attached to the contrasting suffix *-dra-. Texandria may thus be interpreted as the 'land of the southerners'.  History  The region of Texandria is first mentioned by the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus ca. 390 AD. In the 380s, the Salian Franks, after being defeated by Julian ca. 358, were given permission to settle apud Toxiandriam locum ('at a place in Toxiandria'). Texandria in a map of Western Europe (919-1125). Between 709 and ca. 1100, the name Texandria was used to denote a region located in the southern part of the modern Netherlands and the northern part of Belgium. In sources of the period 709‚Äì795, the pagus Texandrie appears concentrated in the basin of the river Dommel and its tributaries, with a first cluster of locations between Alphen in the west and Waalre in the east, and a second cluster more to the south around Overpelt. As a result of a growing elite network of alliances, Texandria expanded between 815 and 914 to a region covering modern North Brabant and adjacent parts of the provinces of Antwerp and Limburg (possibly between Oosterhout, Laakdal and Reppel). In the mid-11th century, Stepelinus, a monk from Saint-Trond, located the region of Campania (firstly attested in this document) within Texandria. From ca. 1225, however, Campania (modern Campine) replaced Texandria as the name of the region. Texandria had nonetheless survived as the name of a vast archdeaconry within the diocese of Li√®ge, although it was eventually replaced with Campania by the end of the 14th century and disappeared from historical records.

Background  Hans Island is located in the middle of the Kennedy Channel between Greenland and Ellesmere Island. A theoretical line in the middle of the strait goes through the island. Canada and Denmark could not come to terms on Hans Island in 1973 when a border treaty was signed, leaving a gap in its border description.  Conflict  In 1984, Canada provoked Denmark by planting their flag on the island and leaving a bottle of Canadian Whisky. The Danish minister of Greenland affairs came to the island himself same year with the Danish flag and a bottle of schnapps and a letter stating \\"Velkommen til den danske √∏\\" ().. The dispute has been on and off being invaded by Danish schnapps only to be recaptured by the Canadians and their whisky.

The government of Greenland agreed to this course of action. Regarding the Danish patrol cutter HDMS Tulugaq then en route to Hans Island, the minister stated \\"I have instructed the ship to sail there, but they will not go ashore tearing down [the Canadian] flag and replacing it with a new one.

He was also the rector of the Untag (17 August University) in Jakarta. Sadjarwo was educated in a Dutch school for indigenous people, and managed to continued his studies until high school. He participated in a nationalist organization during this time. After graduating from high school, he worked as an employee in the Ministry of Labor, founded the Peasants Front of Indonesia, and participated in political activities in Madiun. His career began to rise as he was appointed to the Working Body of the Central Indonesian National Committee. After the recognition of Indonesia, Sadjarwo was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture of Indonesia, representing the Peasants Front of Indonesia. During his time in the ministry, he enacted several policies, including the merger of several academies owned by the Ministry of Agriculture to form the Academy of the Ministry of Agriculture, and the nationalization of Dutch plantations and farms. He was re-appointed as the Ministry of Agrarian Affairs in 1959. He was involved in the creation of the Basic Agrarian Law, which had been proposed since 1948. He proposed the bill to the People's Representative Council, and it was enacted shortly thereafter. After the enactment of the law, he began to implement land reform in Indonesia, but failed due to the prolonged conflicts between various political groups. He was appointed as a member of the People's Consultative Assembly and the People's Representative Council after his appointment as minister was not renewed for the next term. After his resignation from the former position, he became the rector of the Untag (17 August University), a private university in Indonesia. In 1989, seven years prior to his death, he was accused of being a communist by Soegiarso Soerojo, a book author, and Ruben Nalenan, a lecturer from Untag. He managed to prove his innocence of these accusations.  Early life Sadjarwo Djarwonagoro was born on 3 August 1917 in Surakarta. He began his education at the Hollandsch-Inlandsche School (Dutch school for indigenous people), graduating from the school in 1934. He continued his studies at the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (equivalent to junior high school) and graduated in 1937. He went to the Algemene Middelbare School (equivalent to high school), and graduated on 1940. During this time, he joined the Young Indonesia organization and the Indonesian Students' Union.  Early activism After graduation, Sadjarwo worked as a teacher in the Taman Siswa school. He resigned in 1941, and later worked as the Head of the Land Taxation Office in Kediri in 1943. He was transferred to Madiun to work in the same position there in 1946. He was transferred again, and worked as the Head of the Taxation Office in Solo until mid-1947. During this time, Sadjarwo became one of the founding members of the Peasants Front of Indonesia, and served as the organization's vice chairman. He also participated in politics as a member of the Regional Indonesian National Committee of Madiun, and as the Deputy Chairman of the Madiun Executive Body. After his resignation from the taxation office, Sadjarwo became a high-ranking civil employee in the Ministry of Labor. He was appointed in 1947 as a member of the Working Body of the Central Indonesian National Committee, representing the Peasants Front of Indonesia. He was seated in the Internal Affairs and Welfare Section.  Minister of Agriculture  Sadjarwo as the Minister of Agriculture in the Halim Cabinet Sadjarwo was appointed as Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia, a state under the United States of Indonesia, in the Halim Cabinet. After the dissolution of the federal state, he was appointed to the same position in the First Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet, Djuanda Cabinet, Fourth Working Cabinet, and the Dwikora Cabinet, which spanned from 1950 until 1959. = Programs and works (1950‚Äì1957)= During his tenure as the Minister of Agriculture, Sadjarwo actively participated in international conferences regarding agricultural affairs. He attended the 1950, 1952, 1953, and 1957 Rubber Study Group Conference as the leader of the Indonesian delegates. In 1952, when he was not re-appointed as Minister of Agriculture, he was appointed by the Minister of Agriculture at that time, Mohammad Sardjan, as a member of a committee to research and implement Food and Agriculture Organization decisions regarding the agricultural problems in Indonesia. As the Minister of Agriculture, Sadjarwo targeted the year 1954 as the beginning of Indonesia's self-sufficiency on rice production. He stated that rice imports only serve to build inventory and stabilize domestic prices. He highlighted this plan during a visit to Kalimantan, where he also recommended that a fishery cooperative should be established, fishing ships should be motorized, and timber quality in Kalimantan should be improved. = State Minister for Transmigration Affairs = During the formation of the Second Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet, there were calls from President Sukarno and the Central All-Indonesian Workers Organization to place a leftist minister in the cabinet, to take the position of the State Minister for Transmigration Affairs. Even though Sadjarwo was nominally independent, he was the vice chairman of the BTI, which influenced Sukarno to nominate him as a possible leftist minister. This nomination caused the media to label Sadjarwo as a cryptocommunist. Sadjarwo's nomination was strongly opposed by the Masyumi Party, which threatened to withhold its support to the cabinet. The threat caused Sadjarwo's rejection as a minister in the Second Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet. = Opening of the Academy of the Ministry of Agriculture= During his term as the Minister of Agriculture in the Djuanda Cabinet, Sadjarwo officially opened the Academy of the Ministry of Agriculture. The academy was located in Ciawi and was the result of the merger of the Biology Academy, Agricultural Research Academy Course, and the Marine Biology Fisheries Course. Sadjarwo stated that the academy was intended to fill the shortage of skilled employees at the Ministry of Agriculture. = Nationalization of Dutch plantations and farms = By the end of 1957, Dutch-Indonesian relations began to deteriorate due to the conflicts regarding Netherlands New Guinea. During this time, Sadjarwo issued a decree to temporarily confiscate 248 Dutch plantations and farm companies in Indonesia. He stated that the confiscation would end if the Dutch recognized Indonesia's authority over the Netherlands New Guinea. As the Dutch apparently never fulfilled this demand, on 13 February 1959, Sadjarwo announced that the government had permanently confiscated all 248 Dutch companies in Indonesia and would later determine which companies would be nationalized. = Joining the Indonesian National Party = As the Peasants Front of Indonesia became closely affiliated to the Communist Party of Indonesia, Sadjarwo left Peasants Front in 1956 and became a member of the Indonesian National Party in 1957/1958. Sadjarwo was appointed as the second vice chairman of the Indonesian National Farmers' Association, the farming organization of the Indonesian National Party. Even though Sadjarwo left the Peasants Front of Indonesia in 1956, official reports still stated his affiliation to the organization in the Djuanda Cabinet, which was formed in 1957.Official poster of the cabinet by the Ministry of Information  Minister of Agrarian Affairs (1959‚Äì1963) Sadjarwo was appointed Minister of Agrarian Affairs on 10 July 1959, in the First Working Cabinet. He would continually hold the position until 13 November 1963. = Basic Agrarian Law = Sadjarwo's involvement in the Basic Agrarian Law began prior to his appointment as a minister. Since 1948, he was involved in the Yogyakarta Agrarian Committee as a member. This committee was created to establish agrarian law in Indonesia but failed to fulfill its task. In 1951, Sadjarwo was appointed as the vice chairman for a new committee, the Jakarta Agrarian Committee, headed by Sarimin Reksodihardjo. The committee, having not fulfilled its mission, was dissolved several years later. The next committee, the Soewahjo Committee, formed on 14 January 1956, managed to create a draft on the Basic Agrarian Law in 1957. The draft was submitted to the People's Representative Council on 24 April 1958 by the Minister of Agrarian Affairs at that time, Soenarjo. The draft was rejected by the council due to \\"political affairs\\", and President Sukarno advised that the Ministry should revise the draft with recommendations from experts. The revision for the draft was completed during Sadjarwo's term, and on 1 August 1960, the draft was submitted again to the council by Sadjarwo. Less than two months later, on 24 September 1960, the council approved the draft, which was enacted as Law No. 5 of 1960, the Basic Law for Agrarian Affairs. The date of enactment of the law is celebrated today in Indonesia as National Agrarian Day and National Farmers' Day. = Land reform = On his accountability speech in the People's Representative Council regarding the Basic Agrarian Law, Sadjarwo stated that the concept of land reform would be implemented as soon as possible, after the enactment of the Basic Agrarian Law. He pointed out that land reform would evenly distribute lands to the people; avoid speculations and extortion; reinforce the people's rights to land ownership; end the system of landlords and abolish the ownership and control of land on a large scale; increase national farm production; and push for an intensive farming with mutual cooperation. Sadjarwo's Ministry of Agrarian Affairs was so committed to work on land reform that by 1962, the ministry had produced thirteen different land products relating to law reforms. These new guidelines had a major impact on land reform. For example, in Klaten, Central Java, as noted by Soegijanto Padmo, a researcher on agrarian affairs, the regent of Klaten had already established a land reform committee and had enacted several decisions regarding land reform at the village level. Although this program went well in several areas, Idham Chalid, the leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, stated that it caused conflicts between groups in the villages; even waqf lands also became a source of conflict. Chalid advised the government to conduct an investigation into this problem. The leader of the Communist Party of Indonesia, D. N. Aidit, stated that the land reform in Java, Madura, and Bali must be done by the year 1963, and if not, the landlords must be arrested. These continued conflicts eventually thwarted land reform efforts, and the issue was not raised from the New Order government until recently.  During the New Order  Sadjarwo in 1971. After the New Order, a large-scale arrest was launched against members of Communist Party of Indonesia-affiliated organizations, including the Peasants Front of Indonesia. As Sadjarwo had left the organization many years before, he was safe from being branded a communist collaborator, but student demonstrators demanded his resignation as minister. Sadjarwo resigned from his position in 1966, but two years later, he was elected as the member of the Working Body of the People's Consultative Assembly on 29 February 1968 from the Indonesian National Party, replacing Hardi. Several years later, in the 1971 Indonesian legislative election, he was elected as a member of the People's Representative Council from Banyumas, representing the Indonesian National Party fraction. Sadjarwo's official resume for the People's Representative Council does not include his connections to the Peasants Front of Indonesia.  Later life  After the 1971 People's Representative Council officially ended on 1 October 1977, Sadjarwo became the rector of the Untag (17 August 1945 University) beginning in 1986. He also was active in the 1945 Generation organization, which was a group of politicians and military figures that had participated in the Indonesian National Revolution. He served as head of social affairs, transmigration, and law for the organization between 1988 and 1993. = Accusations of being a communist = During his time as the rector of the Untag, Sadjarwo was accused of being a communist by Soegiarso Soerojo, the author of the book Siapa Menabur Angin Akan Menuai Badai (\\"Those Who Sow the Wind Will Reap the Storm\\"). He was identified as the former leader of the Peasants Front of Indonesia. Ruben Nalenan, a lecturer from Untag, also pointed out several books that alleged Sadjarwo was formerly endorsed by the Communist Party of Indonesia as a minister during the first Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet. Nalenan reported this case to the Kopertis (coordinating institution for private universities), the Minister of Education and Culture, and also the Director General of Higher Education. This report was leaked to the press and was first published by the Jayakarta newspaper, owned by the military. Sadjarwo refuted the accusations, and pointed out that during his time with the Peasants Front of Indonesia, the organization was not affiliated with any party. He had left the Peasants Front of Indonesia, he claimed, after he felt that the organization was becoming more and more leftist. He also pointed out that, in 1964, he condemned the actions of the Communist Party of Indonesia and in return, the Communist Party of Indonesia demanded that he be removed from his position as minister. Even though Soerojo admitted his mistakes and revised the book in the third edition, Nalenan refused to admit the fact that Sadjarwo was not a communist. Nalenan stated that the Peasants Front of Indonesia was involved in the Madiun Affair, and in September 1953, the organization officially merged with the Indonesian Peasants' Union. Due to this ongoing accusation by Nalenan, Sadjarwo, along with one of his children, announced plans to sue Nalenan in court. The military intervened, and on 1 February 1988, Sadjarwo was summoned by the regional military office, the Military District Commando 501 located in Central Jakarta. Three days later, the Staff Intelligence Officer of the district commando, Captain Basiroen S., went to Sadjarwo's university, the Untag. Basiroen stated that \\"There was no unrest in the university and the lectures went as usual. The problem is solved, Sadjarwo has clarified in the newspaper and everything is clear\\".  Personal life  Sadjarwo was married to Nyi Endang Soemarti, a poet and a dancer. The couple had seven children. One of them, Isyana Sadjarwo, became the temporary deputy speaker of the People's Representative Council in 1982. On 6 May 1996, Sadjarwo died in Jakarta. He was buried in the Wijaya Brata Garden, a garden cemetery for former teachers of Taman Siswa, located in Yogyakarta.

Though it was initially launched for the Neo Geo MVS (arcade), the title was later released to Neo Geo AES (home), in addition of being ported and re-released through download services for various consoles. Like its predecessor, it was received with mixed reception from critics and reviewers since its initial release. A third entry, Stakes Winner 3, was rumored to be in development but never released.  Gameplay  Arcade version screenshot. Stakes Winner 2 is a thoroughbred horse racing game similar to its predecessor, where players take control of any of the available horses, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, to compete against either AI opponents or other human players across multiple races.Stakes Winner 2 user's manual (Neo Geo AES, JP) Players control their horse with the joystick while two action buttons are used; one controlling the reins for small accelerations that drains little portions of the horse's stamina and another for the whip for fast speed, which drastically consumes stamina from the horse and if the stamina is depleted completely, racing is given up for a short period. Two quick taps on the joystick at any direction allows the horse to push back an opponent in front of them, however two quick taps on the opposite side reduces speed. Power-ups also spawn on the race track for players to pick up. Failing to qualify for the next race results in a game over screen unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.  Development and release  Stakes Winner 2 was developed by Saurus, with additional support from System Vision. The game was first released by SNK for the Neo Geo MVS on September 24, 1996 and was then published for Neo Geo AES on December 13 of the same year. The game was later ported by Saurus to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, both of which were released on May 1997. It has since received multiple re-releases in recent years on various digital distribution platforms such as the Virtual Console, Nintendo eShop, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live.  Reception  Stakes Winner 2 was met with mixed reception from critics and reviewers since its release. In Japan, Game Machine listed it on their November 1, 1996 issue as being the fourth most-successful arcade game of the year, outperforming titles such as Dancing Eyes, Street Fighter Alpha 2 and The King of Fighters '96.

Incident On August 21, 1994, 28-year-old Janet M. Smith entered a grocery store at about 1:10 p.m. with her cat in her arms, holding a folding knife with a 6-inch blade. She said she was thirsty and got a lemon lime soda, and requested someone to call police for her, because someone was following her. She then sat down against the soda cooler, still clutching the knife and the cat. According to cashier Mandy Kerr, she said \\"she didn‚Äôt want to do any harm\\". Managers blockaded the aisle at either end with rows of shopping carts, moved bystanders away, and called police. Five police officers arrived. When officers asked her to drop the knife, Smith threatened to kill the cat. She then got up and began walking towards the police officers, who sprayed her with three cans of pepper mace in an attempt to stop her. She then raised her knife above her head and charged at the police. She was then shot two or three times by one police officer, witnesses said, and then dropped the cat. Also according to witnesses, store employee Amnt Chatelin said she was shot in the throat and in the chest. Aftermath Police spokesman Sgt. David Lerwick justified the shooting, saying they \\"had no choice\\" and that \\"the knife was a deadly weapon.

In 1919, she became head of an investment securities office, the first in New York City to be staffed entirely by women. She built a fortune enough to own a mansion near Bedford Village, New York. In 1958 she was dubbed \\"The First Lady of Wall Street\\" in a newspaper headline. Riis taught investment courses at Columbia University, meant for women students who, like herself, were faced with managing their own personal finances. She also wrote about finance for women's magazines, and counseled women in business. She was longtime president of Riis House, a settlement house in New York. She supported Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal programs during the Great Depression, and encouraged Roosevelt to do more for Jewish refugees from Germany. Late in life, she worked especially for children's programs, including playgrounds.  Personal life  Mary Phillips married widower Jacob Riis in 1907, as his second wife. They lived on a farm in New England, which she inherited, while the rest of the Riis estate was divided among his children. She was widowed after seven years, in 1914. She died in a nursing home in New York City in 1967, aged 90 years. Some of her papers are in the Jacob A. Riis Papers at the New York Public Library. She donated another collection of Riis papers and photographs to the Library of Congress.  References  External links  * *Francesca Pitaro (1985). Guide to the Jacob A.

Knez Aksentije Miladinoviƒá died on 23 January 1820 and was buried in the old cemetery in ƒåibutkovac. The high memorial and the massive stone tablet still mark the place where the knez and vojvode Aksentije Miladinoviƒá was buried almost two centuries ago. By the form and design, the memorial is a typical tombstone from greater Belgrade at the end of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It was cut in harder, greenish sandstone mined in the surroundings for the past two centuries. With its monumental appearance, it dominates the whole area. In the valorization of memorial legacy in Serbia, and particularly in greater Belgrade, the monuments from the Karaƒëorƒëe era represent a first-class historic and social legacies and their value match the importance of the period. The first to surrender to the Turks was Aksentije Miladinoviƒá whom Hurshid Pasha allowed to remain knez of the Belgrade district. Other elders like Avram Lukiƒá of Dragaƒçevo, Voivode Milo≈° Obrenoviƒáand Lazar Mutap followed suit. His memorial is now more precious in view that apart from written records and the vernacular legends still preserved in this region, there are no other documents about this leader from the Kolubara region, except the songs about his heroic deeds in Vuk Karad≈æiƒá's collection of ballads. During the Second Serbian Uprising, the Jagodina and ƒÜuprija regions, or nahiye as they were then called, were of important strategic and tactical locations for military defence of the Belgrade Pashaluk\`s southern borders. An important number of the Serbian troops, led by the regional commanders, were concentrated on these territories, where negotiations were organized for the future relations between Serbs and Turks. The Jagodina and ƒÜuprija regions were included in the Uprising from the beginning. In purpose for defending against the Turkish military campaigns, the Serbian military positions on Juhor, Lipar, Tabori≈°te and in the village of Miliva, were formed and fortified. Serbian uprisings won in several clashes against the troops led by Suleiman Pasha and Marashli Ali Pasha. For willingness of both sides to achieve a peaceful solution, the peace negotiations were started in , and concluded in ƒÜuprija, by agreement between Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá and Mara≈°li Ali-pasha.

He notably served during the War of American Independence.  Biography  In 1775, Beausset captained the 32-gun frigate Oiseau in the Escadre d'√©volution under Guichen. In 1777, he was captain of the 70-gun Dauphin Royal. In 1778, Proisy captained the 74-gun Glorieux, part of the White-and-blue squadron under Du Chaffault in the fleet under Orvilliers. He took part in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778. His nephew, Vallongue, was a Lieutenant on the same ship. The year after, he was part on the Armada of 1779 as Chef d'Escadre on Glorieux. In 1780, Beausset was commanding a 4-ship division. In mid-January, the division departed Brest, arriving at Cadiz on 13 February. From there, he patrolled the Gulf of Biscay to chase British privateers. Such a sortie let to the Action of 9 August 1780, where the Franco-Spanish forces captured 55 merchantmen. Beausset chased the retreating British escort, comprising the 74-gun HMS Ramillies and the frigates Thetis and Southampton. The Franco- Spanish under C√≥rdova patrolled until September, and Beausset advocated that they engage in more aggressive commerce raiding, but C√≥rdova ordered his squadron back to port on 5 September. In 1782, Beausset had his flag on the 110-gun Royal Louis, with Verdun de La Crenne as flag Captain. On 20 October, the Franco-Spanish fleet and the British fleet met off Cape Spartel. Lamotte- Piquet, who commanded the vanguard of the fleet, moved to engage, precipitating the Battle of Cape Spartel. Royal Louis and most of the fleet remained largely out of action. La Crenne requested permission to engage, but Beausset refused and insulted Lamotte-Piquet in front of the crew. When he heard of it, Estaing relieved Beausset and sent him back to France. Consequently, Beausset was not chosen for promotion when two new Lieutenant g√©n√©raux were commissioned. In 1789, Beausset was a member of the Navy Council, with the rank of Lieutenant g√©n√©ral des Arm√©es navales.

Synopsis  Much of the book recounts Kingsnorth's personal history with the environmental movement and with nature. He starts the book with a description of his upbringing, his engagement with the Dongas road protest group, and with his engagement with environmentalism and journalism through his twenties. Kingsnorth then describes how he pivoted into a cynicism with mainstream environmentalism, a cynicism centered on what Kingsnorth feels is a \\"single-minded obsession with climate change\\" that \\"has trumped all other issues,\\" resulting in \\"a curious, plastic world.\\" He highlights some of the ways that this has occurred in England. Kingsnorth finished his book with a chapter titled The Eight Principles of Uncivilisation, which he presents as his manifesto in how to re-evaluate myths of progress and human centrality.  Reception  In his review for The Guardian, Ian Jack argues that, while Kingsnorth's depiction of environmentalism seems reductionist and unfair, the author \\"writes insightfully about England - presciently, too.\\" Jack describes the book as \\"Kingsnorth at his plainest and most provocative,\\" noting that the tone of the book differs significantly from that of Kingsnorth's \\"romantic\\" work Uncivilization. Describing the work overall, Jack says, \\"Hope finds very little room in this enjoyable, sometimes annoying and mystical collection of essays.\\" Writing for Minnesota's Star Tribune, Scott Parker describes the perspective in Confessions as \\"refreshing in both a literary respect and an environmental one.... so radical that, if put into practice, it could effect meaningful preservation.\\" However, when it comes to putting it into practice, Parker finds Kingsnorth's approach \\"somewhat disappointing... when Kingsnorth adopts the rhetorical cautiousness so common to contemporary environmental writing\\" when he upholds his ideas as an individual matter, not to be thrust upon readers or society at large. Though Parker finds Kingsnorth's worldview \\"much-needed,\\" he finds his muted call for change useful in explaining \\"why Kingsnorth's critics call him a defeatist.\\"  References  Category:2017 non-fiction books Category:Climate change books Category:Books about environmentalism Category:English essay collections ","title":"Confessions of a Recovering Environmentalist"},{"id":"64044723","text":"The Lot is a short-lived AMC television series.

Research has been done on multiple geometries and one of the most notable being what is called molecular graphene (in order to mimic graphene structure). Molecular graphene is a part of two-dimensional artificial lattices. Artificial lattices can be studied to test theoretical topology predictions or for their engineered electronic proprieties. Those materials should still be considered at a research stage.  Synthesis  Synthesis of such materials is often achieved using Atomic manipulation by scanning tunneling microscope or atomic force microscope. More and more efforts are being made to achieve a similar atomic precision with focused electron beams. Those methods aren't adapted for a mass production of nanostructures as each molecule has to be moved one by one. To solve this issue, new methods of synthesize those compounds are being researched such as chemical bottom-up synthesis. Currently, multiple methods, often complementary, exist for synthesizing such materials : * Patterning of electron gas extension : this is the method used when the lattice is built from adsorbates over Cu(111) surfaces. * Using localized orbitals from the atomic sites. In the case of molecular graphene, carbon monoxide molecules on Cu(111) surface can be used. Other materials have been shown to be suitable for making molecular graphene suchlike Coronene. Substrates such as Cu(111) are interesting because they have a 2D free-electron-like surface state. If CO molecules are placed onto appropriate positions, as the Cu(111) surface state is scattered from the CO molecules, the surface state electron gas can be confined onto different geometries (e.g. a honeycomb).  Proprieties  The main interest of artificial lattice is that its lattice proprieties (such as the lattice spacing) can be precisely controlled. In the case of molecular graphene, similarities in structure with graphene can provide an indirect to study graphene proprieties. Using a triaxial strain, it is possible to study how graphene react to intense magnetic fields. This strain (creating what is called a pseudo magnetic field) will alter the electronic structure of the molecule in the same fashion a magnetic field would. With this method, we can study how graphene would react to field up to 60 T. Some artificial lattices, such as molecular graphene, also exhibits semi-conductors' behaviors. PNP junctions can be made with the juxtaposition of two artificial graphene lattices with different lattice spacing. Indeed, Fermi level of a molecular graphene is directly linked to its lattice spacing. Graphene is a lattice that can be mimicked in artificial lattices Multiple geometries for artificial lattices has been researched and created. Some of those geometries are : * Graphene * Lieb lattices * Sierpi≈Ñski triangle * Penrose tiling * Kagome lattice * Kekul√© lattice Some of those geometries have a non-integer Hausdorff dimension as they are fractals. Those dimensions can be approximated using box counting methods. This dimension will dictate how electrons of the artificial lattice will behave and move in space.  See also  * Two-dimensional materials * Graphene * Scanning tunneling microscope * Atomic manipulation  Notes  :1. Bottom-up synthesis are chemical processes used in nanotechnologies to create nanoparticles. The principle is to start from atoms, then to gather them in clusters of atoms which will be finally merged into nanoparticles. :2.

Several scholars of nationalism support the existence of nationalism in the Middle Ages (mainly in Europe). This school of thought differs from modernism, which suggests that nationalism developed after the late 18th century and the French Revolution.  Western and Northern Europe  The Council of Constance (1414‚Äì1418) convened to end the Papal schism, which exacerbated growing nationalism in western Europe. At the Council representatives voted by 'nations' as England, France and Germany, and later Spain.Tom James, Overview: The Middle Ages 1154 - 1485 / / Nationalism triumphs, BBC History, 2017 Painting by Vaclav Brozik, 1883. Among the authors who advocates the origin of nations in the Middle Ages is Adrian Hastings (1929 ‚Äì2001). His seminal work is ‚ÄúThe Construction of Nationhood: Ethnicity, Religion and Nationalism‚Äù (1997), based on a series of lectures given in 1996 at Queen's University, Belfast. Hastings criticizes the modernist theory of Eric Hobsbawm, Ernest Gellner, John Breuilly and Benedict Anderson, and argues that religion is central to the creation of nations and nationalism. In his view, England is considered the oldest example of a mature nation, and the development of nations is closely linked to the Christian Church and the spread of written popular languages to existing ethnic groups. Other authors trace the origins of nationalism and the national consciousness of England and some European nations soon after the Middle Ages, in the 16th century. Hastings argues that what allowed the emergence of nationalism was the spread of the ability to write and read. For many non-modernists, nations have emerged from the Judeo- Christian tradition. John Alexander Armstrong (1922‚Äì2010) was one of the first modern scholars to argue that nations have pre-modern roots and that their formation was helped by religious institutions locally. In the same vein, other anti-modernist studies by Hastings, Anthony D. Smith, and Steven Grosby attributed nationalism on the Judeo-Christian traditions. Hastings emphasizes the role of language, and sees the opposition of Christianity to Islam as a critical factor in the formation of nationalism. He also considers as an important factor in ethnogenesis in the Western Europe the conviction of being a chosen people, which was further strengthened by the tension between Catholicism and Protestantism. Azar Gat (who claims that the Jewish nation has existed since antiquity) claims (contra Anderson) that the creation of imagined communities was made possible not only by secularization and the rise of print capitalism in modern era, but could also be produced earlier by the spoken word and via religious rituals. Gat does not agree with the modernist view that pre-modern multi-ethnic empires were ruled by an elite indifferent to the ethnic composition of its subjects. In fact, almost all of the empires were based on a dominant ethnic core, while most ethnic communities were too small and weak to have their own independent state. According to the historian Caspar Hirschi, it is the concept of nations and nationalism that changes over time, and 18th century is only the beginning of the modernist model of this concept. In his work ‚ÄúThe Origins of Nationalism‚Äù, he presents the evolution of nationalism since the 14th century. In his view, nationalism was born in Catholic Medieval Europe and was the consequence of Roman imperialism. Caspar Hirschi, The Origins of Nationalism: An Alternative History from Ancient Rome to Early Modern Germany, Cambridge University Press, 2011, p. 2 According to Hirschi, nationalism is not necessarily a mass phenomenon (as modernists believe) but can be the discourse of nationalist elite minorities.Grosby, S., Leerssen, J., & Hirschi, C. (2014). Continuities and shifting paradigms: A debate on Caspar Hirschi's 'The origins of nationalism'. Studies on National Movements, 2, pp 24-35: Caspar Hirschi, \\"Duck or quack? On the lack of scholarly soundness and decorum in Joep Leerssen‚Äôs review. Other scholars, such as Doron Mendels, Steven Grosby, and Aviel Roshwald, argue for the rise of a kind of nationalism among the ancient Jews. David M. Goodblatt supports the same theory, pointing out that Jewish nationalism appears in the self- description of the Jews of the Second Temple period (5th - 1st century BC). Sverre Bagge investigates the origins of Norwegian nationalism from the gradual \\"unification of the kingdom\\" in 9th century, which led to the formation of the Norwegian, Danish and Swedish kingdoms. A kind of Norwegian state existed by 13th century, with public justice, taxation, a common military organization and royalty. By 12th and 13th century a popular saga literature was widespread (oral and written), expressing national patriotic sentiments. A significant part of the population was loyal to the king and identified their interests with his. Bagge believes that in the case of Norway, between nationalism in the Middle Ages and in the modern period there is a difference of degree rather than a difference of quality. The Carroccio (the sacred car) was a powerful symbol of the identity and honor of North Italian city-states during the civic nationalism period of mid 12th to 14th century. (Karatasli, p. 13). Here, reproduction of the Carroccio during the parade of the Palio di Legnano, 2015 Prof. Sahan Karatasli examining the various forms of collective identity in Northern from 11th to 16th century, believes that in mid 12th century city-states formed a ‚Äúcivic nationalism‚Äù was developed. At that period, the communes of the cities incorporated their countryside (contado) and acquired a territorial existence. This process created internal social divisions and rivalries, which was the reason for the invention of new forms of bonds between social groups and between state and subjects. Older practices like the ecclesiastical boundaries (diocese) were utilized, which unified the city and the countryside. New symbols and myths and ‚Äúinvented traditions‚Äù were also created. A notable ‚Äúinvented tradition‚Äù was the new cults of patron-saints, like Saint Ansano of Sinea, St. Alexander patron of Bergamo, St. Petronio, patron of the Bologna etc. Most of these ‚Äúnew‚Äù saints were local people (including many laywomen) from humble backgrounds that ordinary people could easily associate with themselves, and were promoted not by ecclesiastical powers but by urban laity (i.e. communal governments). Civic rituals and festivals associated with these saints that emphasized the unity of the commune or the city-state were established. The image of the saint-patron was seen as a sign and the guarantee of the unity between the city and the contado.

Eastern Orthodox Church, Byzantium, Slavs and Greeks  Golden coin (hyperpyron) issued by Michael VIII Palaeologus to celebrate the liberation of Constantinople from the Latins, and the restoration of the Roman/Byzantine Empire. The Bitola inscription from 1017 reveals that Tsar Samuil and his successors considered their state Bulgarian,Dennis P. Hupchick, The Bulgarian-Byzantine Wars for Early Medieval Balkan Hegemony: Silver-Lined Skulls and Blinded Armies, Springer, 2017, , p. 314. and they had incipient Bulgarian ethnic consciousness.Michael Palairet, Macedonia: A Voyage through History, Volume 1, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016, , p. 245. Dimitri Obolensky considers that the Orthodox Slavs in Eastern Europe and Balkans (Russians, Bulgarians and Serbs) had nationalism and a national consciousness during the Middle Ages. This nationalism was mobilized by their dissatisfaction with the imperialism of the Byzantines, especially in ecclesiastical matters, such as the appointment of bishops by the Patriarch of Constantinople. From a positive point of view, the Patriarch helped the creation of national consciousness by establishing ecclesiastical districts in Slavic areas. The dioceses of Wallachia in 1359 and Moldavia in 1401 were also founded. The Patriarchate from time to time made such concessions to other Slavic Christian populations, such as granting autocephaly to the Churches of Bulgaria and Serbia, or appointing ethnic Russians as Metropolitans of Kiev. Some scholars believe that the roots of modern Greek nationalism dates back to the Middle Ages, especially between the 13th and mid-15th centuries. In this view, the event that led to the development of modern Greek national consciousness was the conflict with the Fourth Crusade and subsequent Frankish rule. Modern Greek nationalism rises after the conquest of Constantinople in 1204 and the creation of the despotates which succeeded the Byzantine Empire, especially in Epirus, Nicaea, and Morea. At that time, the term Hellene (\\"Greek\\") revived ‚Äì having been previously discredited as a synonym for \\"pagan\\" ‚Äì and was used in parallel with \\"Roman\\". Stephen G. Xydis uses the term proto-nationalism for the emergence of the modern Greek national identity in late Byzantium. John Alexander Armstrong (1922‚Äì2010) refers to a \\"premature nationalism\\" of this Byzantine period, based on a sense of God's choice and protection in an age of adversities. As \\"true Israel\\", the Orthodox Church and the community enjoyed God's favor, while priests and the people fought against the ‚Äúheretical‚Äù Latins and the ‚Äúunfaithful‚Äù Turks. According to Michel Boucard the Eastern Orthodox world had a long tradition of biblical translation to national languages since the 2nd century. Orthodoxy and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople facilitated the formation of national autonomous Orthodox Churches, by producing national alphabets like the Early Cyrillic alphabet. Through an analysis of a 14th‚Äêcentury religious text, he demonstrates that there was a clear sense of Russian nationhood. He proposed that these old religious texts demonstrate the need to revise some assumptions concerning the presumed modern nature of nationhood. In an earlier work, Bouchard traces the Russian national consciousness in the 11th century, as it is reflected in religious texts such as Slavic psalms and apocrypha. According to Richard J. Crampton, the development of Old Church Slavonic literacy during the 10th century had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the Eastern South Slavs into the Byzantine culture, which promoted the formation of a distinct Bulgarian identity.

The name refers to the healing of the paralytic at Bethesda by Jesus. The colony was located near Paranam in the Oost resort on the Suriname River. It was located on the former sugar plantation Groot Chatillon The Catholic leper colony which used to be at Batavia had moved nearby. Overview Bethesda was founded in 1899 as a small leprosy colony. In 1902, Henry Weiss left for the United States with some pictures of the colony taken by Martha Stern in order to raise funds. Weiss managed to visit President Theodore Roosevelt. The mission was clearly successful, because the next set of photographs by Martha Stern display an American flag. The colony treated between 50 and 60 patients in the period 1910‚Äì1921. The colony was a little agricultural village with several pavilions, and some residential houses in a park. The patients did not receive any wages, and were expected to work, if able. The care for the lepers was partially financed by donations, and partially by a Government subsidy of ∆í 250.00 (1910. 2018: ‚Ç¨2,856) per year per patient. On 25 October 1951, A.C.W. Lionarons, a doctor in Paramaribo, left his entire fortune to the foundation which as of 2002 was worth over a million euros. In 1933, the colony was moved, because of flooding, to Livorno, near the present harbour of Paramaribo, and renamed to Nieuw Bethesda., where it has remained in function until 1962. Lepers are nowadays treated in the Academic Hospital Paramaribo. The Bethesda Foundation is still active, and since 2007 has broadened its target audience to people with a severe handicap in Suriname, because the rate of leprosy has declined.

They were \\"subject to a perpetual anathema\\" along with the Cathars and Patarenes, Humiliati, Poor Men of Lyon, Passagians and Arnaldists. Almost nothing is known about the Josephines. They are mentioned, again alongside the Passagians, who practised circumcision, in a bull of Pope Gregory IX in 1231 and in charters of Emperor Frederick II in 1239. From this, Robert Eisler concludes that they were Judaizers. He connects them to a seventh-century Paulician sect claiming descent from Josephus Epaphroditus, already recognised as a spurious figure by Peter of Sicily and Pseudo-Photius in the ninth century. He represents a conflation of Flavius Josephus and the freedman Epaphroditus. For Eisler, such ideas were transmitted by the Slavonic Josephus, which he accepted as authentic. He thus traced the western Josephines, whom he placed in Lombardy and Provence, to the Paulicians resettled in Europe in the eighth century. The Josephines are sometimes identified with the Josephists (Josephistae) mentioned by a 13th-century writer in Germany. The latter are accused of practising only spiritual marriage and condemning sexual activity, in which case they probably took their name from Saint Joseph, who, on the Catholic view of the perpetual virginity of Mary, did not consummate his marriage. Ilarino da Milano, however, rejected this identification as baseless.

While 3 RNA genomes were obtained: BatPV/Eid.hel/GH10/2008; BatPV; Eid.hel/GH45/2008; and BatPV/Eid.hel/GH48/2008, only isolate BatPV/Eid.hel/GH10/2008 contained enough RNA to reliably quantified.

Infectious particles could not be isolated in cell culture; no cytopathic effects were observed and no viral RNA could be obtained. KV would be the first known Henipavirus detected outside of the Austroasiatic geographic province that other known Henipaviruses are known to circulate. Serological evidence has previously suggested that Henipaviruses likely have a much wider geographic range beyond areas of endemic Nipah and Hendra infection, namely that undetected henipavirus infections may be common in South America and continental Africa. Compared to other Henipaviruses, KV exhibits reduced surface expression of the attachment glycoprotein (KV-G). It is likely that KV-G expression is delayed in the endoplasmic reticulum and is not exported as readily to the cell surface due to defects in higher-order oligomerization.

One of the most effective early feminists in Portugal, she fought for the rights of women factory workers and encouraged the education of women, launching the Portuguese Group of Feminist Studies in 1907. She was a co- founder of the Republican League of Portuguese Women in 1908, later becoming President of the Board, while in 1915 she promoted the involvement of women in politics, founding the Female Association of Democratic Propaganda. Biography Born on 26 February 1871 in Faro, Maria Carolina Frederico Crispin was the daughter of Jo√£o Diogo Frederico Crispim, a proprietor, and Carlota Perp√©tua da Cruz Crispim. In the early 1900s, she was active as a journalist in the south of Portugual, publishing poetry, children's stories and a booklet titled Emancipa√ß√£o Feminina (Women's Emancipation). In 1908, while working as a teacher at the Afonso Costa School Centre in Lisbon, she created evening courses and gave educational lectures encouraging women to enter professional life or engage in politics. In particular, she called for votes for women, training and education for women, reduced working hours and access for women to all professions. She became a member of the Republican League of Portuguese Women (RLPW). The following year, on her initiative, the RLPW founded Obra Maternal, an initiative in support of the care and education of needy or abandoned children. In 1912, she was appointed to serve as a delegate for Lisbon's Childhood Surveillance Centre, a position she maintained until 1941. In June 1913, she, Ana Augusta de Castilho, Beatriz Pinheiro, Luthgarda de Caires and Joana de Almeida Nogueira were part of the Portuguese delegation at the Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in Budapest. In 1915, Veleda founded the Women's Democratic Propaganda Association (Associa√ß√£o Feminina de Propaganda Democr√°tica), designed to encourage women to become free thinkers and fight inequality and militarism. Upset by the violence of the newly founded republican regime, she abandoned politics in 1921. Instead, she turned to spiritualism, founded the Spiritualist Group Light and Love (Grupo Espiritualista Luz e Amor), organized the Portuguese Spiritual Congress (1925), and contributed articles to the spiritualist press.

Plutarch derives the name from suillus, a Latin adjective relating to swine, which he notes were, along with other livestock, among the principal measures of value in early Rome.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Poplicola\\", 11; \\"Quaestiones Romanae\\", 41.PW, Suillius. The nomen is easily confused with that of the Suellia gens, with which it might perhaps be identical. Like the Suillii, the Suellii used the cognomen Rufus, although that surname was abundant enough to arise by chance in unrelated families. However, while the epigraphy of the Suellia gens places their origin firmly in Samnium, none of the Suillii are found in that region, although several inscriptions of this gens are from other parts of Italy, including Etruria and Campania. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Suillia gens were Publius and Marcus, both among the most common names at all periods of Roman history. In inscriptions we also find Manius, Gaius, Lucius, and Titus. Branches and cognomina Only one distinct branch of this family occurs in history, consisting of the descendants of Publius Suillius Rufus, whose surname belongs to a common type of cognomen derived from the physical features of individuals, and originally designating someone with red hair.Chase, pp. 109, 110. It is not clear whether this surname was inherited from earlier generations, or passed down to his descendants, as his sons bore the surnames Caesoninus and Nerullinus, presumably alluding to their maternal forebears; however, there appears to have been a Suillius Rufus among the African colonials of this gens, though there is no evidence to show whether he was a descendant of the same stirps, or merely shared a ubiquitous surname. Members * Publius Suillius Rufus, the half-brother of Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, was the quaestor of Germanicus, but banished by Tiberius for accepting bribes while a judex. Recalled by Claudius, he became a trusted advisor to the emperor, and was consul in AD 41; but he wasted his talents and was too easily influenced by money, and was banished again by Nero. Suillius was a son-in-law of the poet Ovid.Tacitus, Annales, iv. 31, xi. 1, 4, 5, xiii. 42, 43.Pliny the Elder, Historia Naturalis, vii. 4. s. 5.Ovid, Epistulae ex Ponto, iv. 8.., .PW, Suillius 4.PIR, S. 700. * (Publius) Suillius P. f. Caesoninus, accused of complicity in the scandalous marriage of Gaius Silius and the empress Messalina, was spared execution on the grounds that \\"his part had been the reverse of masculine\\".Tacitus, Annales, xi. 36.PW, Suillius 2.PIR, S. 698. * Marcus Suillius P. f. Nerullinus, consul in AD 50, was spared punishment when his father was banished by Nero, and was proconsul of Asia at the beginning of the reign of Vespasian.Tacitus, Annales, xii. 25, xiii. 43.Eckhel, ii. p. 556., , .PW, Suillius 3.PIR, S. 699. * Publius Suillius (P. f.) Rufus, hypothesized to be a third son of Rufus, and the brother of Caesoninus and Nerullinus, may instead be the same person as Rufus.PW, Suillius 5. * Marcus Suillius (M. f. P. n.) Nerullinus, named on a coin from Hierapolis in Asia, is perhaps the Nerullinus known to Athenagoras, in which case he may have been the son of the consul Nerullinus, and governor of Asia under the Antonines.Eckhel, \\"Caes.\\", p. 78.Athenagoras, Apologia, 26.PW, Suillius 1. =Others= * Suillius, named in an inscription from Vasio in Gallia Narbonensis.. * Suillius, named in a pottery inscription from Noviomagus Batavorum in Germania Inferior.. * Marcus Suillius M. f., named in a sepulchral inscription from Spoletium in Umbria.. * Publius Suillius P.

In other words, a positive linear operator maps the positive cone of the domain into the positive cone of the codomain. Every positive linear functional is a type of positive linear operator. The significance of positive linear operators lies in results such as Riesz‚ÄìMarkov‚ÄìKakutani representation theorem.  Canonical ordering  Let (X, ‚â§) and (Y, ‚â§) be preordered vector spaces and let \\\\mathcal{L}(X; Y) be the space of all linear maps from X into Y. The set H of all positive linear operators in \\\\mathcal{L}(X; Y) is a cone in \\\\mathcal{L}(X; Y) that defines a preorder on \\\\mathcal{L}(X; Y). If M is a vector subspace of \\\\mathcal{L}(X; Y) and if H ‚à© M is a proper cone then this proper cone defines a canonical partial order on M making M into a partially ordered vector space. If (X, ‚â§) and (Y, ‚â§) are ordered topological vector spaces and if \\\\mathcal{G} is a family of bounded subsets of X whose union covers X then the positive cone \\\\mathcal{H} in L(X; Y), which is the space of all continuous linear maps from X into Y, is closed in L(X; Y) when L(X; Y) is endowed with the \\\\mathcal{G}-topology. For \\\\mathcal{H} to be a proper cone in L(X; Y) it is sufficient that the positive cone of X be total in X (i.e. the span of the positive cone of X be dense in X). If Y is a locally convex space of dimension greater than 0 then this condition is also necessary. Thus, if the positive cone of X is total in X and if Y is a locally convex space, then the canonical ordering of L(X; Y) defined by \\\\mathcal{H} is a regular order.  Properties  :Proposition: Suppose that X and Y are ordered locally convex topological vector spaces with X being a Mackey space on which every positive linear functional is continuous. If the positive cone of Y is a weakly normal cone in Y then every positive linear operator from X into Y is continuous. :Proposition: Suppose X is a barreled ordered topological vector space (TVS) with positive cone C that satisfies X = C - C and Y is a semi-reflexive ordered TVS with a positive cone D that is a normal cone. Give L(X; Y) its canonical order and let \\\\mathcal{U} be a subset of L(X; Y) that is directed upward and either majorized (i.e. bounded above by some element of L(X; Y)) or simply bounded.

The University of Nebraska's Keim Hall is named in his honor.  Early life and education  Keim was born on September 10, 1886 in Hardy, Nebraska. He attended Bethany College in 1904 and received a teacher's certificate from Peru State College in 1909. He worked as a principal for several years before moving to Lincoln, NE to attend the University of Nebraska. He earned his bachelors in 1914 and a masters in 1918. During his time as a student he meet Rollins A. Emerson prior to Emerson's move from Nebraska to Cornell University. He married his wife Alice Mary Voigt in 1914. They had two children, Virginia Voigt Honstead and Wayne Franklin Keim. Wayne ultimately also became an agronomist, professor, and chair of the department of agronomy at Colorado State University.  Career  After completing his bachelor's, Keim worked at the University of Nebraska as an extension agronomist. After completing his masters, he became a professor in the Department of Agronomy. Keim's interest in plant genetics lead him to pursue a PhD with Emerson, now at Cornell. He employed sabbaticals and annual leaves to earn a PhD from Emerson at Cornell while continuing to serve as a faculty member at the University of Nebraska, completing his PhD in 1927. In 1930 he became the chair of the Agronomy department, a position held for the next twenty-two years. During his time as chair the size of the department doubled and he built connections with the USDA with federal government researchers stationed at and working within the department. From 1945 to 1946 he was sent to France to teach plant genetics and agronomy to US army soldiers waiting to return home from the war at Biarritz American University.

He graduated from the Konstantinovsky Artillery School in 1897 and the Nikolaev Academy of the General Staff, Russia's senior staff college, in 1903. He was assigned to the Life Grenadier Guards of the 2nd Guards Infantry Division. He participated in the 1904 Russo-Japanese War, serving on the headquarters staff of the 18th Army Corps until 1906, when he was transferred to the Turkestan Military District. In 1909 he was assigned to the Russian General Staff. ; on Chronos World History (in Russian) Upon the Russian entry into World War I Romanovsky was named chief of staff of the 25th Infantry Division. For action during the Russian invasion of East Prussia he was awarded the Order of St. George in 1914. In August 1915 he was appointed commander of the 206th Infantry Regiment, part of the 52nd Infantry Division. From June to October 1916 he served as chief of staff of the 13th Army Corps. From October 1916 to March 1917 he was quartermaster general for the 10th Army before becoming chief of staff for the 8th Army under Lavr Kornilov, who Romanovsky would follow as a staff officer when Kornilov became Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Provisional Government's armed forces.

He was a participant in the 1917 Kornilov affair, the attempted military coup d'√©tat led by Kornilov against the Russian Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet. Kornilov and his co-conspirators, including Romanovsky, were arrested in September and imprisoned in Bykhov (today Bykhaw in Belarus).Smele, p. 34 After the October Revolution, however, Romanovsky escaped the prison with Kornilov and traveled to the Rostov region to seek allies among the anti- Bolshevik Don Cossacks. He masqueraded as an ensign during his travels to escape detection by Soviet authorities.Figes, p. 558 Romanovsky joined the Volunteer Army upon its creation in December 1917 under Mikhail Alekseyev, serving as head of the military headquarters and later as the army chief of staff. He participated in the Ice March from Rostov to Kuban. He became chief of staff of the Armed Forces of South Russia and in 1919 was promoted to lieutenant general. He became a favorite of Anton Denikin, who had also served under Kornilov, after Denikin became commander of the Volunteer Army.Figes, p. 568 Romanovsky was not a popular figure due to his abrasive personality and his advice to Denikin during the summer of 1919 to not prioritize the siege of Tsaritsyn.Luckett, p. 277 He was blamed for the defeats the Volunteer Army subsequently suffered as well as the death of Mikhail Drozdovsky, one of his rivals. In March 1920 the Volunteer Army evacuated from Novorossiysk to the Crimea. On March 16, 1920, after arriving in Theodosia, Romanovsky resigned as chief of staff.Luckett, p. 354 On March 22, 1920, after the appointment of Pyotr Wrangel as Commander-in-Chief of the White forces, Romanovsky (along with Denikin) left Theodosia for Istanbul in Turkey. He was killed on April 17, 1920 in the billiard room of the Russian embassy. His killer is believed to be Mstislav Khoruzin, an embittered former White officer.Mawdsley, p. 224 He was also member of a monarchist organization and, like many others on the Right, considered Romanovsky to be a \\"liberal,\\" a freemason, and the chief architect of all the failures of the White cause.Smele, p. 325 See also *White movement *Volunteer Army *Russian Civil War  Citations  References   * *  External links  *Ivan Romanovsky on Russian Wikipedia (in Russian) *Ivan Romanovsky on \\"Russian Army in the Great War\\" (in Russian) *Ivan Romanovsky on \\"The Great Russian Encyclopedia\\" (in Russian) Category:1877 births Category:1920 deaths Category:Imperial Russian Army generals Category:Russian anti-communists Category:Russian military personnel of the Russo-Japanese War Category:Russian military personnel of World War I Category:People of the Russian Civil War Category:White movement generals ","title":"Ivan Romanovsky"},{"id":"64045470","text":"Nyikang is a semi-legendary founder of the Shilluk Kingdom, in the 16th century.

During Babylonian persecution of Pumbeditan Jewry, several notable scholars left to establish a Yeshiva academy in Firuz Shapur. Rav Mari served as the dean of this Yeshiva until the death of Hanan of Iskiya in 609, after which he was elected successor in the gaonate.  Biography  Besides his being the son of Rav Dimi, little is known of Rav Mari's personal life, and much of what is known derives from the works of Rav Sherira Gaon some 300 years after Rav Mari's death. He was referred by some as \\"Sargo\\" (◊°◊ï◊®◊í◊ï) which some have speculated to be his place of birth. Most scholars agree that after the death of Hanan of Iskiya, he was elected to replace Hanan as the dean of the Pumbedita Academy.

Csorwe, an orc, is pledged to be sacrificed to the Unspoken God before she is rescued by the wizard Sethennai. She becomes his assassin and spy, dedicating her life to the search for a missing artifact. An unexpected encounter with a young mage calls Csorwe's loyalties into question. The Unspoken Name is the first in the planned Serpent Gates series. Plot Thirteen-year-old Csorwe is an orc living in a temple called the House of Silence, where she is pledged to be the Chosen Bride of the Unspoken God. On her fourteenth birthday, she is destined to be sacrificed to the god. On the day of the ritual, a traveling wizard named Belthandros Sethennai convinces her to abandon her vows and become his apprentice. Oranna, a necromancer from the House of Silence, becomes jealous that Sethennai did not rescue her from the temple and vows revenge. Csorwe trains under Sethennai, gaining skills as a spy and assassin. She helps him to regain his position as the Chancellor of the city of Tlaanthothe. Sethennai takes the nephew of the previous Chancellor, Tal Charossa, as another pupil. Tal and Csorwe despise one another, and their mutual hatred drives many of their actions. They both pledge to help Sethennai recover the Reliquary of Pentravasse. In their search for the Reliquary, Csorwe meets young mage Adept Shuthmili. Shuthmili has been exploring the ruined monument that holds the Reliquary. Oranna arrives and seizes the Reliquary; Csorwe chooses to save Shuthmili rather than pursue Oranna. Shuthmili is destined to become part of a hive mind of mages designed to protect the Qarzashi Empire; Csorwe convinces her to abandon this duty and escape with her. Csorwe retrieves the Reliquary from Oranna, who is then imprisoned by Sethennai. In the struggle, Shuthmili is captured and returned to the Empire. Csorwe frees Oranna, and they work together to rescue Shuthmili. Csorwe and Shuthmili begin a romantic relationship. A series of rescue attempts ends when Shuthmili kills an Empire Inquisitor and is arrested for treason. Shuthmili and Tal steal the Reliquary from Sethennai. Csorwe rescues Shuthmili from the Empire for a final time. She learns that the Reliquary holds Sethennai's heart, granting him immortality. She and Tal both abandon Sethennai, feeling that they have been used. Csorwe and Shuthmili trade the Reliquary to Sethennai in exchange for escape on an Empire ship. Background Larkwood calls The Tombs of Atuan by Ursula K. Le Guin her favorite novel. In this novel, a young woman escapes from the cult of a strange god with the help of a kind and considerate wizard. Her character of Belthandros Sethennai was inspired by imagining a wizard who was the opposite in terms of personality. Larkwood began the novel by developing her magic system, believing that tying it to religion made it feel less artificial. She was inspired by Throne of the Crescent Moon by Saladin Ahmed with regards to magic and divine power. Larkwood had previously worked on stories in a \\"vaguely Medieval European\\" setting and was concerned with anachronism. She rejected this idea for The Unspoken Name, preferring instead to focus on the characters and plot rather than \\"a defined 'tech level' and a little snowglobe of geopolitics\\". This philosophy also contributed to the lack of homophobia in the novel. Reception The work received moderately positive reviews from critics. Publishers Weekly gave the novel a starred review, praising the \\"lyrical, immersive prose\\" and complex worldbuilding. Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"imaginative but never fully convincing\\", praising the \\"crisp, vivid prose\\" but decrying the meandering plot. Writing for Tor.com, Linda H. Codega praised the author's queer representation, as well as the \\"sharply polished\\" and \\"multifaceted\\" characters.

She is known for her research on waterbirds and coastal birds of the Ukrainian Black Sea region and for her efforts to improve environmental protections for them. Her studies included Mediterranean gulls, swans, eiders, ducks, geese, and terns, among others.  Early life and career  Ardamatskaya was born in Leningrad to a lawyer father and a doctor mother, both graduates of the University of Leningrad. When her father, a hereditary nobleman, was exiled to the Volga steppes in the mid-1930s, Ardamatskaya was forced to leave Leningrad with her mother and two sisters and move to the rural settlement of Aleksandrovo, Leningrad region. Despite difficult circumstances, time spent surrounded by and observing nature‚Äîexploring the woods, riding horseback through the fields, and nursing owl, jackdaw, and magpies chicks‚Äîencouraged her to become a naturalist. After graduating from high school, Ardamatskaya went south to Odessa to mitigate an aggravated medical condition with the Black Sea coastal climate. She spent one year enrolled in the biology program at Odessa University before an improvement in health allowed her to return to Leningrad and transfer to the University of Leningrad. As an early student of the Soviet ornithologist Aleksey Malchevskiy at University of Leningrad, Ardamatskaya became part of a renaissance in Soviet ornithological study in the early 1950s. Ardamatskaya graduated from the Department of Vertebrate Zoology in 1952. Doctors again advised that she move to a climate more conducive to her health‚Äîeither the mountains or the Black or Caspian Sea‚Äîso she accepted a research position at Azov-Syvash Nature Reserve in Soviet Ukraine. During this time, she met Boris V. Sabinevsky, a prominent ornithologist who later became her husband. A year later in 1953, she left Azov-Syvash to take a research position at Black Sea Reserve, where she stayed for 35 years. Ardamatskaya lived in southern Ukraine on the coast of the Black Sea for the remainder of her life. Ardamatskaya completed her doctorate at the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (now the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine), successfully defending her dissertation on the nesting ducks in the northwest Black Sea region in 1963. She continued to study various species of ducks in the Black Sea region over the course of her career, developed recommendations for their protection, and advocated for the implementation of those protections.  Later career and legacy  Beginning in the 1960s, Ardamatskaya helped orchestrate and carry out large-scale bird ringing projects to study the seasonal movements of Black Sea region water and coastal birds like the Mediterranean gull. For the first time in southern Ukraine, her banding projects clarified the dates and paths of seasonal migrations and the breeding, nesting, molting, and wintering areas for many water and coastal birds. Ardamatskaya became affectionately known as the \\"Mother of the Mediterranean Gull\\" for her in-depth study of the species and the protective measures she developed that improved nesting conditions and restored their numbers. Thanks to her decades-long work at the Black Sea Reserve, the nesting bird population within the reserve markedly increased, and new areas of land important for environmental conservation were added to the reserve, including eastern part of the Gulf of Tendra. On her initiative, a number of new nature reserves were also created in other parts of the Kherson region. Ardamatskaya was an integral part of the scholarly ornithological community in the Soviet Union and Europe during her time. She attended all 10 of the Soviet Union's ornithological conferences, and in the late 1970s helped found the Azov-Black Sea Ornithological Working Group in the 1970s, a scholarly forum that remains active today. Sometime in the 1990s to 2000s, she also served as a senior researcher at Azov-Black Sea Ornithological Station for several years. Based upon her extensive fieldwork, Ardamatskaya not only published over 170 scientific papers but also fought for bird conservation throughout her life, providing youth education programming and advocating for a science-based approach to waterbird game season regulation. As part of her conservation efforts, Ardamatskaya helped found the Ukrainian Society for the Protection of Birds in 1994, was elected its first president, and remained its honorary president in the last years of her life. Due in large part to her research and charismatic advocacy, several of the bird species she worked with were entered in Ukraine's endangered species list, opening the way for greater protections and public awareness.

Housewright (October 7, 1913 ‚Äì January 11, 2003) was an American microbiologist who conducted research on germ warfare. Having been assigned to the Fort Detrick laboratory in the mid-1940s and appointed scientific director in 1956, Housewright played a major role in the development of bioweapons for a proposed attack on Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1966, he was appointed president of the American Society for Microbiology. He left Fort Detrick in 1970 following President Nixon's moratorium on US bioweapons research, and later published several books on water safety for the National Academy of Sciences. In the 1980s, Housewright became executive director of the American Society for Microbiology. He died in Frederick, Maryland, in 2003. Early life and education Housewright was born in Wylie, Texas on October 7, 1913. He attended the teachers' college at North Texas State College for his bachelor's degree and earned a master's degree in microbiology from the University of Texas. In 1939, he married Marjorie Bryant, a fellow graduate of the teachers' college. Housewright was assigned to the Fort Detrick laboratory in Frederick, Maryland, in 1943 or 1944 as a naval lieutenant. He completed his PhD at the University of Chicago in 1944. Career At the time that Housewright was appointed to Fort Detrick, the institution was an epicenter of biological warfare research. In his early years at Detrick, Housewright studied botulinum toxin and anthrax as potential weapons against the Germans and Japanese. He became head of the microbial physiology and chemotherapy department in 1946, and in 1950 was named chief of the medical bacteriology department. In 1956, Housewright was appointed scientific director of Fort Detrick. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Housewright worked with Pentagon officials to develop weapons for a potential germ warfare attack on Cuba. Under Housewright's direction, the scientists at Fort Detrick developed a cocktail of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever; Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus; and staphylococcal enterotoxin B. This mixture of microorganisms and toxins was intended to cause rapid and long-lasting incapacitation while posing little risk to American troops because of the agents' non-contagious nature. It was projected that this bioweapon could kill up to one percent of Cuba's population. Thousands of gallons of the agent were produced at the Pine Bluff Arsenal under the supervision of William C. Patrick III; however, the plan was never carried out. In 1969, president Richard Nixon announced that the US would cease all research into bioweapon development. Housewright left his post as scientific director the next year, taking up the role of vice president at a private microbiology company in Bethesda, Maryland. Housewright retired from the Naval Reserve in 1966, having earned the rank of captain. The same year, he was elected president of the American Society for Microbiology. In his later career, Housewright was a staff officer and program director at the National Academy of Sciences. In this position, he carried out extensive studies on the safety of drinking water, publishing four books on the subject. He became executive director of the American Society for Microbiology in the 1980s. Personal life and death Housewright's first wife died in 1962. He married Artemis Jegart, an artist from Florida, in the late 1960s. Housewright was a member of the Cosmos Club and director of the Rotary Club in Frederick, Maryland.

Frescati Shipping Co., 589 U.S. ___ (2020), was a United States Supreme Court case dealing with the responsibility of costs of cleanup resulting from a 2004 oil spill on the Delaware River near Paulsboro, New Jersey from the result of a hull rupture. The ship's owner, the Frescati Shipping Company, was responsible the costs of the cleanup, coming to more than , but under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, believed that Citgo, who had ordered the shipment, bore responsibly for the shipping route through shallow waters that led to the spill. After years of litigation, the Supreme Court ruled in its 7-2 decision that the contract language established between Citgo and Frescati established that Citgo would provide safe berth for the vessel, and thus ultimately responsible for the spill.. Case background On November 26, 2004, the Athos I, a single-hull oil tanker carrying of oil that had traveled from Venezuela was maneuvering to dock at a Citgo dock on the Delaware River near its refinery at Paulsboro. An anchor in the river's bed, known to have been there since at least 2001, caught on the ship's hull and tore a gash into it, releasing more than of oil into the river. The spill spread downstream affecting the shoreline in more than three states (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware), killing over 11,000 birds, temporarily shut down the Salem Nuclear Power Plant, and halted commercial use of the river for several weeks during cleanup efforts. At the time, it was considered the second worst oil spill in the United States following the Exxon Valdez oil spill, with cleanup costs over . The spill led to passage of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 which among provisions, tripled fines resulting from oil spills from single-hulled vessels to encourage double-hull use, as well as requiring those with knowledge of obstructions in waterways to inform the Coast Guard for immediate removal. The Athos I was under a time charter from the Frescati Shipping Co. to Star Tankers Inc. under a multi-year contract, while the specific transport from Venezuela to New Jersey was a standard voyage charter between Star Tanker and Citgo. Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, Frescati was considered to be the responsible party and was to pay for more than in cleanup, though the Act limited Frescati's responsibility to about , with the rest paid out of the government's Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, approximately . The United States Coast Guard also bore some of the costs. As the Oil Pollution Act allows for recovery of cleanup funds from liable parties after the matter, Frescati and the United States Government filed suit against Citgo in 2011 to recover their costs, asserting it was their responsibility to make sure the area around their docks had safe berth for the vessel. The anchor was found to be just within the safe berth clause in the Star-Citgo voyage charter. Frescati sought to recover their with the interest in addition to in costs to repair the Argos I. Heard in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Judge John P. Fullam ruled in favor of Citgo, stating in his ruling that the ultimate responsible was on the party that left the anchor in the river, which was impossible to identify as any markings had long worn off from it. Frescati appealed to the Third Circuit, which partially vacated the District Court's ruling. The Third Circuit stated that the District Court had ignored the language of the contract law that still applied to the matter, and remanded the case back for review on this matter. On review, District Judge Joel Slomsky (taking over for the retiring Judge Fullam) did affirm in his 2016 ruling that it was Citgo's responsibly to provide safe berth to the Athos I near its port under terms of the contract, and thus partially responsible for the cleanup spills, ordering Citgo to pay ( and interest) to Frescati and to the government. Citgo appealed again to the Third Circuit, arguing on the terms that the safe berth passage was considered a duty of due diligence rather than an assurance of safe passage. The Third Circuit rejected Citgo's argument and upheld the ruling in 2018 and further found that Citgo should be held responsible for more of the government's sought damages, as it rejected Citgo's claim that removing the anchor was the Coast Guard's responsibility. In their opinion, the Third Circuit stated that Citgo was attempting to argue for equitable relief in terms of splitting the costs for cleanup, but the case was about contractual relief under the terms of the charter contracts and the Oil Pollution Act. Supreme Court Citgo petitioned to the Supreme Court on the question of the safe berth clause being an assurance of safe travel or duty of due diligence, as their case along with others from the Second and Fifth Circuits created a split decision. The Supreme Court accepted the writ of certiorari in April 2019. Oral arguments were heard on November 9, 2019. Reporters found the Justices mostly sided on a strict contract reading supporting the intention that the safe berth clause was to be read as an assurance of safe travel, as if Citgo wanted to use other less-strict language to reduce their liability, there was many other contract mechanisms available they could have used. The Court issued its decision on March 30, 2020, affirming the Third Circuit's decision. In the 7-2 majority opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that \\"We conclude that the language of the safe-berth clause here unambiguously establishes a warranty of safety\\", and thus Citgo was responsible for assuring the safe berth for the Athos I and the subsequent cleanup from the oil spill. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Samuel Alito, in which he wrote that the language of the safe berth clause was not clear that it implied a warranty, and that there should be an evaluation if this was considered a standard practice in the industry.

They are joined by the family's hostess, socialite Louise von Louwe, and by Robin Tripp, a charismatic young television host who is courting Anne. The arrival of Tripp precipitates a further crisis in the mind of Gibbs, who has long felt responsible for the suicide of the young man's father, an old friend named Rudy Tripp. Gibbs is haunted by the memory of the grieving widow's report that the arrival of a notice of dismissal, sent by Gibbs but delivered by an aide, was seen as a betrayal by Rudy, ‚Äòthe last, terrible straw‚Äô. This guilt is magnified for Gibbs when he begins to suspect that Robin Tripp holds him responsible for the death of his father. Tripp is the driving force behind a particularly uncomfortable televised debate between Gibbs and Senator Edward Farwell, a strongly conservative politician who self-righteously opposes the appointment of Gibbs. Upon being questioned heatedly by Farwell over the suicide of Rudy Tripp, Gibbs responds by honestly relaying the story and his own sense of guilt on national television, bypassing both his audience and Farwell with the concluding words to their host: ‚ÄòYours is the verdict I want, Tripp‚Äô.Buechner, Frederick (1958). The Return of Ansel Gibbs. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p. 126. The would-be cabinet member also faces inquest from his old mentor and tutor in theology, Henry Kuykendall, who, in his old age, has taken to running a mission to the poor in Harlem. The novel is, as Dale Brown writes, ‚Äòa series of trials‚Äô: ‚ÄòGibbs is on trial with the senate, with his daughter, with Robin Tripp, with Kuykendall, and with Farwell. Most of all, however, he is trying himself.‚ÄôBrown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 89. . OCLC 255278233. In the wake of his television appearance, which is seen as a disaster by his advisors, Gibbs visits Sylvia Tripp to seek forgiveness and clarity over the death of her husband, and his own involvement in it. There he receives a sort of absolution, with the revelation that Rudy's mounting sense of self-loathing and personal failure, accumulated over many years, was the real cause for his suicide.  Characters  * Ansel Gibbs: A retired lawyer, public servant, and widower, Gibbs has achieved much in his life. His sharp intelligence and vast experience render him eminently qualified to return to life in the upper echelons of power, yet his increasing self-doubt, which stretches beyond questions concerning his personal relationships to wider existential crises about faith and civilisation itself, prove a barrier to his acceptance of the role offered to him. Further to this, his suspicions that his critics may be correct about the flaws they perceive in his past life and character leads him to ask, and eventually answer, the difficult questions of identity around which the novel is centred. * Anne Gibbs: Young, conscientious, and thoughtful, Anne assists her father's old mentor, Henry Kuykendall, in his ministry to the poor in Harlem. She often encourages her father to seek a righteous path, and is constantly in mind, and at pains to remind him, of the needs of the underprivileged. * Robin Tripp: Young, ambitious, and charismatic, Tripp is renowned for his skill as an interviewer, often hypnotising his guests with his charm, and drawing them into personal confessions on live television. Behind his TV personality, however, is a man struggling to come to terms with the great tragedy of his life, the death of his father. * Henry Kuykendall: Kuykendall's retirement from his position as professor of Old Testament studies at Harvard has led to a second career of devoted ministry. The wise, if a little eccentric, aged divine has given his life to service of the poor and destitute of Harlem. From his mission house in the upper west-side, Kuykendall operates as a sort of mystic, exhorting Gibbs and those around him to fulfil their potential as prophetic forces for good in the world. The inspiration for this mesmerising character was found in Buechner's own tutor in Old Testament studies, James Muilenberg, a member of the faculty at Union Seminary in New York City. * Porter Hoye: A wily political operative, Hoye dutifully attempts to protect Gibbs from public embarrassment and failure. These attempts, however, often involve diverting Gibbs away from reaching answers to his existential questions. * Edward Farwell: A caricature of a conservative politician, Farwell is visibly disgusted by what he perceives to be Gibbs's urbane detachment, and elitism. A.C. Speckorsky writes that Farwell is ‚Äòan isolationist right-wing leader, spellbinder, know-nothing.‚ÄôBrown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 89. . OCLC 255278233.  Themes  Written at a time when Buechner was beginning to consider ordination to the ministry, The Return of Ansel Gibbs explores many of the themes that would become central to Buechner's future work. At its very centre is the question of the possibility of faith and the search for identity ‚Äì a search that Gibbs undergoes in full view of his family, friends, opponents, and the nation. As with Buechner's first two novels, A Long Day‚Äôs Dying and The Seasons' Difference, much of the novel is concerned with the thought-life of its characters. Critic Dale Brown notes its ‚Äòautobiographical texture‚Äô,Brown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 106. . OCLC 255278233. and the development of recurring Buechnerian themes such as ‚Äòheroism in spite of handicap‚Äô,Brown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 97. . OCLC 255278233. the ‚Äòrejection of sterile inaction and apathy‚Äô, ‚Äòambiguity‚Äô, ‚Äòdoubt‚Äô, and ‚Äòthe courage required to assert one‚Äôs humanity in the modern world‚Äô.Brown, W. Dale (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 91-2. . OCLC 255278233.  Composition  As with his second novel, The Seasons' Difference, much of Buechner's third novel was written in Oxford, England. In his memoir, Now and Then (1983), Buechner recalls the several months following his wedding (which was officiated by James Muilenburg), noting that the composition of the novel in characteristically dismissive fashion: 'after two months near Oxford, in England, and two more near Innsbruck, in Austria, during which my wife wrote thank-you letters for wedding presents and I wrote a long-out-of-print novel for posterity, we returned to New York [...]. For lack of a better title, I called the novel The Return of Ansel Gibbs.'Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 35. . Buechner's drawing upon the theme of suicide in the novel, and particularly his use of several details from the suicide of his own father, caused tension between himself and his mother. In Telling Secrets (1991), he writes: > Don't talk, trust, feel was the law we lived by, and woe to the one who > broke it. Twenty-two years later in a novel called The Return of Ansel Gibbs > I told a very brief and fictionalized version of my father's death, and the > most accurate word I can find to describe my mother's reaction to it is > fury. For days she could hardly bring herself to speak to me, and when she > did, it was with words of great bitterness.  Critical reception  The Return of Ansel Gibbs was received with some critical acclaim, winning the Rosenthal Award, and being adapted for the screen for Playhouse 90 (Brown, p. 104).Brown, W.

Marquand, who wrote, concerning Buechner's character development within the novel, that: ‚ÄòThere is depth and sensitivity to his writing that gives life to the most unreal of his characters. There is an introspective understanding of the struggle of the human soul that is as unusual as it is refreshing.‚ÄôMarquand, John P. Review of The Return of Ansel Gibbs: A Novel, by Frederick Buechner, Borzoi Books, Alfred A. Knopf, 1957. (See back of The Entrance to Porlock for review). Indeed, the character of Gibbs would draw comment from several reviewers and critics, including A.C. Speckorsky, who wrote of Gibbs: 'Behind his demeanour of blandly impassive detachment there is a man in the throes of a crisis of confidence, of nerve, and of faith, a man involved in a searching attempt to grapple with the fundamental issues of men and morals, of civilization and government ‚Äì and his involvement with them.'A.C. Speckorsky, ‚ÄòA Crisis of Conscience, Saturday review, February 15, 1958, 21, quoted in Brown, p.89 Critic and author Norman Podhoretz suggested that we find located in Gibbs a common trope of 20th century literature, that of nihilism and the ‚Äòloss of values‚Äô: > Gibbs suffers from a certain deficiency of feeling, a certain remoteness > from the natural processes and the elemental emotions. He is almost > incapable of passion (sobriety, judiciousness, detachment, moderation, > tolerance being the civilized virtues), and he can no more satisfy his old > teacher‚Äôs demand that he become a prophet than he can prate sentimentally > like the senator about Mom‚Äôs apple pie.

The practice is common to Theravada Buddhists throughout mainland Southeast Asia, primarily in Myanmar (Burma) and Thailand.  History  The earliest extant reference to the sand pagoda building tradition is in Burmese literary works, namely a pyo verse poem composed by Shin Maha Silavamsa during the Kingdom of Ava (c. 1500s). By contrast, Burmese oral tradition attributes the custom of building sand pagodas to the arrival of Ayutthayan royals, advisors and their retinue in the Konbaung Kingdom, which occurred two centuries later, following the fall of Ayutthaya in the Burmese‚ÄìSiamese War (1765‚Äì1767). The custom was practiced throughout the kingdom in pre-colonial Burma, including by the royal court.  Regional celebrations  Myanmar = During MƒÅgha P≈´jƒÅ, known as the Full Moon Day of Tabaung, Burmese devotees in Upper Myanmar construct sand pagodas in honor of the Buddha. The festivities are collectively called sand pagoda festivals (·Äû·Ä≤·Äï·ÄØ·Ä∂·ÄÖ·Ä±·Äê·ÄÆ·Äï·ÄΩ·Ä≤). The Rakhine people also build sand pagodas during this season, in a festival called Shaikthaunghmyauk festival (·Äû·Äª·Äæ·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äû·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äº·Äæ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äï·ÄΩ·Ä≤), held on the seabanks of cities like Sittwe. Mandalay holds two major sand pagoda festivals, at the Mont Tisu and Maha Walaku Pagodas. Burmese sand pagodas are typically of graduated five tiers, tapering to the top, with each tier flanked by bamboo masts. The five tiers represent five layers of Mount Meru, the legendary peak of Buddhist cosmology. Devotees offer fruits, flowers and other offerings, and circumambulate the sand pagoda thrice before paying homage. On the full moon day of Tabaung, the sand pagoda's umbrella crown or hti is removed. In 1961, Burmese president U Nu performed a yadaya ritual to avert disaster in the country, by ordering the construction of 70,000 sand pagodas. = Thailand = In Northern Thailand, sand pagodas are constructed during Songkran. The largest such festival in Chiang Mai is held at Wat Chetlin; the resulting pagoda has five tiers, stands about tall, and uses of sand.

Early Life Garland was born on June 26, 1899, in Hamilton, Massachusetts, the son of James Albert Garland Jr. and his wife Marie Louise (n√©e Tudor). Known since childhood by the nickname \\"Barley\\", he enjoyed a privileged upbringing, being educated at Eton College, St. Paul's School (Concord), and Harvard University. He married Mary Mildred Wrenn in 1919. Refusal of Inheritance Charles Garland's grandfather James Albert Garland Sr., Vice President of the First National Bank of New York, died in 1900. He left an immense fortune in bank stock, railroad stock and real estate to his son (Charles's father) James Albert Garland Jr. James Albert Garland Jr. himself died of pneumonia in 1906. His will stated that his estate (then valued at ten million dollars) should go to his wife until her death or remarriage, and thereafter to his sons, including Charles. Marie forfeited her right to the riches by remarrying in 1912. This left the estate in a trust fund, to be managed for the benefit of her sons until they reached the age of twenty-one. Charles Garland gained fame in November 1920 when it was announced that he had renounced his share of the inheritance, valued at one million dollars. He told newspapers that he had not earned the money, and that he did not believe in private property. He instead stated his intention to become an auto mechanic in order to provide for his wife and baby daughter. He later explained to a reporter that he would not accept money from \\"a system which starves thousands while hundreds are stuffed\\" and which \\"leaves a sick woman helpless and offers its services to a healthy man.\\"Harpers magazine, no. 142 (February 1921), pg. 397. Cited in Gloria Garrett Samson, The American Fund for Public Service: Charles Garland and Radical Philanthropy, 1922-1941. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1996; pg. 1. Garland indicated to this reporter that he was not refusing to accept these funds because of socialist beliefs, but rather because as part of his study of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the works of Leo Tolstoy and H.G. Wells, he had come to the earnest belief that the money \\"is not mine.\\" Garland's wife Mary stated that she supported the decision, and that she would also refuse any inheritance from her own wealthy family. There were newspaper reports that Garland had refused another million-dollar inheritance from his uncle, but Garland later denied that this was the case. Establishment of Garland Fund Hearing of the young man's decision to refuse his inheritance and his rationale, the socialist author Upton Sinclair urged Garland to accept the money not for his personal gain, but rather to put it to a higher use. Sinclair suggested making $100,000 donations to a set of specific organizations seeking to change the economic and social system of which Garland disapproved. These organizations favored by Sinclair included The Liberator magazine, the socialist daily newspaper The New York Call, the communist daily newspaper The Daily Worker, the Federated Press news service, the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Union Against Militarism, and the magazine edited by 1916 Socialist Party Presidential candidate Allan L. Benson, Reconstruction.Sinclair to Garland, December 2, 1920. Cited in Samson (1996) p. 2. In 1921, Garland was approached by Roger Baldwin, head of the American Civil Liberties Union, probably through ACLU attorney Walter Nelles, a law partner of Swinburne Hale, who had recently married Garland's widowed mother.Samson (1996) p. 2. Baldwin convinced Garland to accept his father's inheritance and to establish with it a \\"national trust fund\\" which would aid efforts to expand \\"individual liberty and the power of voluntary associations.\\"Samson (1996), pp. 2-3. On July 5, 1921, the American Fund for Public Service, colloquially known as the \\"Garland Fund\\", was formally incorporated by Lewis Gannett of the New York World, Robert Morss Lovett of the University of Chicago, and Roger Baldwin.Robert C. Cottrell, Roger Nash Baldwin and the American Civil Liberties Union. New York: Columbia University Press, 2000; pg. 130. The money behind the fund was held in the form of securities at the First National Bank of New York. In preparation for the task of distributing the funds, Roger Baldwin reached out to the Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Russell Sage foundations to determine how those philanthropies handled grant requests. In January 1922, Garland announced that he had changed his mind, and would indeed accept the inheritance, in order to use it for his \\"own special purposes\\", which he declined to reveal. He soon clarified that he would give a third of the money to his wife (from whom he was now separated), keep only $500 for himself, and donate the remainder to \\"about ten persons\\" in whom he had faith. In July 1922, it was formally announced that Garland would use $800,000 of his inheritance to endow the fund. The Fund later made significant donations to the ACLU and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). According to the autobiography of James Weldon Johnson, who was one of the fund's directors: Garland occasionally communicated with the directors of the Fund. For example, around 1931 he sent a letter criticizing the NAACP's actions in the Scottsboro Boys case as \\"anything but advanced or radical\\", and suggesting that International Labor Defense would be a more worthy recipient of the Fund's support. Communes Garland, after his separation from his wife, established two successive agricultural communes, or \\"colonies of idealists\\", both named April Farm. The first April Farm, in which Garland lived from January 1922, was at North Carver, Massachusetts. In 1924, Garland moved to a new \\"April Farm\\" in Lower Milford Township, Pennsylvania. Garland scandalized polite society by inviting young women to live with him at these colonies, where he planned to \\"work out the problems of life\\". Police confirmed to the newspapers that they would enforce state anti-adultery laws against Garland, who was still legally married to Mary. The popular press regularly featured lurid stories about Garland's \\"love farm\\".e.g. He fathered three children with Bettina Hovey, a member of the commune. One of these children, a girl named Barbetta, died in 1925 at the age of three months. In January 1926, a charter for the commune was denied by Lehigh County court, after an attorney objected that members \\"believe in and probably practice what is known as free love\\", an accusation denied by Garland. Garland was subsequently arrested for adultery on the basis of Barbetta's death certificate, in which he was named as a parent along with Hovey. He was fined $500 and jailed for 60 days. While imprisoned, he wrote two short stories which were published in the local press. His wife divorced him later that same year. Later life and death Garland left April Farm in 1930, donating it to Richard Holt, one of the colony's members. He lived out the rest of his life in obscurity. He married Ursula Feist, one of the colonists, with whom he already had a child. In 1932, it was reported that he was working at an automobile factory in the Soviet Union. In 1941, the Fund was dissolved. It returned a balance of $2,000 to Garland, who was living in Mount Vernon, New York, with his second wife Ursula and four children. In 1943, he was reportedly working as a machinist in New York City. He subsequently bought a farm in New Hampshire, around 1955. He died in New Ipswich in 1974. He was survived by his wife Ursula, five sons, and four daughters.

In 2019, Volynets stated that it was not right to punish parents for having young children who smoke.The Parents Committee appreciated the idea of punishing parents of smokers In the same year, she called for the release of infant formulas for free and only with a prescription. She supported the initiative of the Public Chamber to introduce fixed work loads for children in schools to remove the work overload from additional subjects. In 2020, together with the All-Russian Trade Union of Education, she acted as co- organizer of the press conference \\"The bill on tougher penalties for insulting and attacking schoolchildren on teachers\\" held in the newspaper Izvestia.

Cambodia complained to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1959, and it judged in 1962 that the temple is situated in Cambodian territory. The dispute arose from the different maps each party used in national delimitation. France, who was the protector of Cambodia at the time, agreed with Siam in Franco-Siamese boundary treaty of 1904. The Mixed Commission was set up in 1905, and it was to carry out delimitation between Siam and Cambodia. Cambodia used the map published by French geographers in 1907 (called \\"Annex I map\\") which showed the Temple in Cambodian territory. While Thailand used the provisions of the treaty of 1904 which reads: > \\"The frontier between Siam and Cambodia starts, on the left shore of the > Great Lake, from the mouth of the river Stung Roluos, it follows the > parallel from that point easterly direction until it meets the river Prek > Kompong Tiam, then, turning northwards, it merges with the meridian from > that meeting-point as far as the Pnom Dang Rek mountain chain. From there it > follows the watershed between the basins of Nam Sen and the Mekong, on the > one hand, and the Nam Moun, on the other hand, and joins the Pnom Padang > chain the crest of which it follows eastwards as far as the Mekong. Upstream > from that point, the Mekong remains the frontier of the Kingdom of Siam, in > accordance with Article 1 of the Treaty of 3 October 1893.\\" This would deem the temple as being located within Thai territory. The ICJ judged on 15 June 1962 that Annex I map did not bind both parties because it was not the work of the Mixed Commission per the treaty. However, both parties adopted the map and the demarcation line in it, therefore had a binding character. The Siamese government did not disagree or object to the map, hence Thailand was bound by it, according to the legal principle \\"Qui tacet consentire videtur si loqui debuisset ac potuisset.\\" ICJ ruled by nine to three that the Temple was located in Cambodian territory and Thailand was obliged to withdraw all stationed troops there, and by seven to five, that Thailand restore to Cambodia any objects removed from the ruins since 1954. Even though the court settled the territorial issue, the political conflict continues to this day. After Cambodia applied the temple to be recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008, this led to a new round of armed conflict between Cambodia and Thailand, with the latter perceiving the event as Cambodia gaining the disputed land around the temple. Cambodia requested a reinterpretation of the 1962 ICJ judgement in 2011, regarding the definition of the \\"vicinity\\" in the previous judgement. The ICJ ruled on 11 November 2013 that the 1962 judgement awarded all of the Preah Vihear promontory to Cambodia, and ordering the withdrawal of Thai soldiers.  References  * MISSLING, Sven.

Martin Peak is situated 80 miles northeast of Seattle, and northwest of Holden, in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, on land managed by the Wenatchee National Forest. Martin Peak ranks 56th on Washington's highest 100 peaks, and 54th on the \\"Bulger List\\". The nearest higher neighbor is Bonanza Peak, to the west, and Riddle Peak lies to the east-southeast. Precipitation runoff from the mountain and meltwater from the glacier in the east cirque drains into nearby Lake Chelan via Railroad Creek and Company Creek. Topographic relief is significant since the southern aspect of the mountain rises 4,900 feet above the Railroad Creek Valley in approximately . The first ascent of the peak was made in July 1936 by Ida Zacher Darr.http://www.rhinoclimbs.com/WA100HighestFAChronology.htm Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Martin Peak is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. With its impressive height, Martin Peak can have snow on it in late-spring and early-fall, and can be very cold in the winter. Geology Martin Peak (upper right) and Bonanza Peak (left) seen from Seven Fingered Jack The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is west-southwest of Martin Peak, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It followed his 1636 volume Prodromus Coptus sive Aegyptiacus (The Coptic or Egyptian Forerunner), the first ever published grammar of Coptic. Lingua Aegyptiaca Restituta was dedicated to the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III and published in Rome by Herman Scheuss. Development and reception The basis of the work was manuscripts containing an Arabic-Coptic vocabulary that he had obtained from Pietro della Valle. Della Valle had originally given these manuscripts to a Franciscan named Tomasso Obicini to edit and publish. When Obicini died, Della Valle passed the material on to Kircher, who did not give either of them credit in his acknowledgements, but the work was in fact a translation of the glossaries contained in those manuscripts. At the same time, Kircher used the new book as an opportunity to include extensive revisions to the Prodromus Coptus - various scholars had pointed out mistakes in his earlier work. Lingua Aegyptiaca Restituta, on the other hand, was regarded as an authoritative piece of scholarship for man years - as late as 1775 parts of it were incorporated into Scholtz and Woide's Lexicon Aegyptiaco-Latinum. Notable content Lingua Aegyptiaca Restituta contained the notation for a Coptic hymn that Kircher claimed to have written down from \\"the mouth of my Coptic scribe\\", whose identity is unknown. The hymn is however not found anywhere in the contemporary Coptic liturgy, and has been described by some scholars as sounding like \\"a Western Church hymn.\\" These considerations aside, the work remains the earliest-known Western transcription of Coptic music. The work also contained tables of the Coptic and Arabic names of signs of the zodiac and the 28 sets of equinoctial- ecliptic stars. It is not clear however whether the Arabic names derived from the earlier Coptic forms, or whether the Coptic terms were themselves borrowed from the Arabic. Kircher asserted that the Ancient Egyptian names, preserved in Coptic, formed the basis of Babylonian and Indian names for the same equinoctial-ecliptic stars. Relationship with other works The preface also announced that, having concluded his studies of Coptic, he intended to publish a comprehensive work on the language of ancient Egypt, his Oedipus Aegyptiacus. In fact however before he embarked on this major work, he produced a smaller volume of Egyptological analysis, his Obeliscus Pamphilius (1650). See also *Ibn Kabar Bibliography * Fletcher, J.

Early life  Mary Porter Beegle was born in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, the daughter of William Henry Beegle and Lavinia B. Johnson Beegle. Her father was a newspaper publisher. She earned a bachelor's degree from Columbia University in 1909. She attended the Chalif Normal School of Dancing, and pursued further dance studies in Germany. A relative, whose married name was Mary Porter Beegle (1818-1888), wrote hymns and published two books of poetry, Alethea (1886) and Ocean Spray (1876).  Career  Beegle taught dance and physical education at Manhattan Trade School for Girls from 1904 to 1911, and at Barnard College from 1910 to 1916. She wrote an academic article, \\"Hygiene and Physical Education in Trade Schools for Girls\\" (1914), about the physical education side of her work, but she advised elsewhere that \\"the dance must not be taught as a species of athletic hygiene,\\" but \\"for the sheer joy of doing, the joy of creation and expression.\\" At Barnard, she was also active in the school's Greek Games event, an annual celebration of Greek language and culture. She was involved in planning and staging pageants inspired by Greek dance and drama. She chaired the festival committee of the Drama League of America's New York chapter when it marked Shakespeare's tercentenary with an original production, Caliban by the Yellow Sands (1916), directed by Beegle. She co-authored a book, Community Drama and Pageantry (1916, with Jack Randall Crawford), outlining her work on outdoor pageants. Also with Crawford, she wrote The Book of the Pageant of Elizabeth (1914). She spoke at a conference on pageantry in New York in 1914. She created The Romance of Work (1914), featuring dances based on women's factory work, and directed a similar dance component of a 1916 pageant in Newark. \\"Pageantry's whole point lies in the fact that it is not, and cannot be, the work of a single individual,\\" she explained. \\"It is a co-operative art in which there is opportunity for all to share according to the measure of their time and skill.\\" Beegle was among the founders of Camp Fire Girls, an American youth organization. From 1934 to 1939, she ran a community arts center, Waverly Terrace Auditorium, in Yonkers. She started working at the New School for Social Research in 1939, in various administrative roles, including Assistant Treasurer, Director of Promotion, and Director of Public Relations. She retired from the New School in the 1950s. Beegle survived the sinking of the SS Andrea Doria in 1956, but lost much of her work, and her late husband's papers, in the accident. She sued the ship lines for $350,000 for the irretrievable losses.  Personal life  Beegle married Viennese architect and theatrical designer Joseph Urban in 1919, as his second wife. She was widowed when he died in 1933. She and her step-daughter donated Joseph Urban's surviving papers to Columbia University. Some of her professional papers are in the archives of the New School for Social Research.

Because Joseph became Gaon under such political tension, many regarded him as a pawn of the Exilarch, unfit to serve as the Sura Gaon. Sherira Gaon describes Joseph stating that: \\"he was not very eloquent and was a trifling scholar compared to R. Saadia Gaon‚Äù. After Saadia and David reconciled, Joseph was promptly replaced by Saadia. Although he continued to receive a pension from the academy, and after Saadia's death in 942, he once again served as the Sura Gaon until 948, after which he moved to Basra, where he died around 960.

It was their second season in the top flight of Swiss football after their promotion from the Nationalliga B during the season 1945‚Äì46. Basel played their home games in the Landhof, in the Quarter Kleinbasel. Jules D√ºblin was the club's chairman for the second successive season.  Overview  Anton Schall was to continue as first team manager, but he died at the age of 40 years, during a workout on the football field, shortly after the pre- season training had begun. Following this unhappy event captain Ernst Hufschmid then took over as player-manager. Basel played a total of 46 games in this season. Of these 26 in the Nationalliga A, four in the Swiss Cup and 16 were test games. The test games resulted with eight victories, three draws and five defeats. In total, they won 18 games, drew 13 and lost 15 times. In total, including the test games and the cup competition, they scored 100 goals and conceded 93. There were fourteen teams contesting in the 1947‚Äì48 Nationalliga A, the bottom two teams in the table to be relagted. Suffering under the shock of team manager Schall's death, the team started the season badly, losing six of their first eleven games without a single victory. With seven victories in the second half of the season the team were able to lift themselves out of the relegation zone. Basel finished the season in 10th position in the table, with seven victories from 26 games, ten draws and they lost nine times. The team scored 44 goals in the domestic league. Paul St√∂cklin was the teams top goal scorer with 11 goals. Gottlieb St√§uble was second best scorer with eight goals. Ren√© Bader and Traugott Oberer both scored five times. Bellinzona won the championship. FC Bern and Cantonal Neuchatel ended the season on the relegation places. In the Swiss Cup Basel started in round 3 with a home match against SC Balerna, the game was won 7‚Äì0. In round 4 Basel were drawn with a home tie against Z√ºrich which was won 2‚Äì1. Round 5 gave Basel another home tie in the Landhof against Locarno and this ended with a 5‚Äì3 victory. Thus Basel advanced to the quarter-finals, where they were drawn away against La Chaux-de-Fonds. The hosts won the game by two goals to nil and continued to the semi-final and the final. The final was played on 29 March at Wankdorf Stadium in Bern against Grenchen and ended with a 2‚Äì2 draw. The replay three weeks later was also drawn 2‚Äì2 and so a second replay was required. This was played on 27 June in the Stade Olympique de la Pontaise in Lausanne. La Chaux-de-Fonds won the trophy, winning the game by four goals to nil.  Players  The following is the list of the Basel first team squad during the season 1947‚Äì48.

Early life and family Angela Russell was born Angela Gertrude Coyne in Tralee, County Kerry on 15 November 1893. Her parents were James Aloysius, an inspector of national schools, and Kathleen Mary Coyne (n√©e Pitt). She was the seventh of nine children, with 3 sisters and six brothers. She attended the Ursuline convent, Waterford, and Loreto College, St Stephen's Green, Dublin. She entered University College Dublin in 1915 to study medicine. In 1921 she graduated with MB, BCh, BAO, going on to complete the Diploma in Public Health (DPH) in 1928. She met Matthew Russell while studying for her DPH, he was a lecturer on the course, and they married at St Mary's church, Haddington Road, Dublin on 31 July 1924. The couple had three children, a daughter and two sons. Joan, their daughter, died in her twenties and inspired the poem Joan Russell by Patrick Kavanagh who was in love with her. Their sons, John and Matthew, became a Jesuit priest, and a barrister and a civil servant respectively. She was widowed in 1956. Russell died on 2 March 1991, in her home at 14 Bushy Park Road, Rathgar, Dublin. Career Russell never entered private medical practice, going on to be a prominent member of a number of women's social reform movements from the 1930s to the 1960s. These organisations included National Council of Women of Ireland, the Women's National Health Association, and the Irish branches of Save the Children and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. She served as joint honorary secretary of the Joint Committee of Women's Societies and Social Workers (JCWSSW) with Winifred O'Hegarty. JCWSSW was established in 1935 to respond to the Irish government's failure to implement the Carrigan committee on sexual abuse and prostitution in Irish society recommendations. The report by the committee had been circulated to the cabinet in December 1931, and was buried by first the Fianna F√°il government in 1932 and later by the Geoghegan committee in 1933. In December 1935, Russell was part of the delegation from the JCWSSW which met with Patrick Ruttledge, minister for justice, to protest at the government's failure to act on the committee report. Members of JCWSSW were also active in attended law courts when cases against women and children were heard, and visited reformatories to report on improvements that could be made to them. Russell appeared frequently as a contributor on newspaper and radio programmes speaking about medical issues, possibly at the encouragement of her brother-in-law, John MacDonagh, a productions officer at Radio √âireann. Like her medical contemporaries, such as Ella Webb and Kathleen Lynn, Russell was a supporter of St Ultan's, the hospital for infants. Like the medical staff of St Ultan's, Russell believed that women needed to be educated in medical matters to improve the health of Irish women and children generally, stating that \\"public ignorance was mainly responsible for public ill-health\\". She held many traditional views, such as the importance of the role of women as primarily homemakers, lecturing widely on the topic, she also advocated for an adaptive workplace that would accommodate the needs of family life. From 1946 to 1974, she was a member of the central council of the Irish Red Cross, and served on the Junior Red Cross and the national geriatrics committees of the society from 1953 to the early 1980s. Russell was a member of the Commission on Itinerancy, which reported in 1963. She also served as chair of Cheeverstown Convalescent Home for Children, and on the Board of the Meath Hospital. The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland hold a small collection from the Russells of ephemera relating to public health, presented by their sons.

The common name Itchgrass comes from the bristly (hispid) leaf-sheath which can be irritating to the skin. Rottboellia cochinchinensis is native to tropical Asia and Africa and has also been introduced to the Americas where it is often considered to be an invasive species.Clayton, W. D. (1980). Notes on the Tribe Andropogoneae ( Gramineae ) Kew Bulletin, 35(4), 813‚Äì818. It is a major weed of a wide range of crops including maize, rice, sorghum and sugar cane.Bolfrey-Arku, G.

Weed Science, 59(2), 182‚Äì187. https://doi.org/10.1614/ws-d-10-00095.1 Description Rottboellia cochinchinensis is an annual with prop roots supporting erect, laterally- branching culms which are usually between 30‚Äì300 cm in length, although up to 400 cm high culms have been described.Cope, T. A. (2002). Rottboellia L.f. In G. V. Pope & E. S. Martins (Eds.), Flora Zambesiaca (pp. 174‚Äì176). London: Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Cauline leaves arise from hispid leaf-sheaths with irritating hairs, especially on the lower sheaths. The leaf-sheaths are as wide as the blade at the collar and have a truncated, membranous ligule of 1mm in length. The leaf blades are slightly rough (scabridulous) and are generally linear to linear-lanceolate, terminating in an acuminate apex.Beentje, H. (2016). Plant Glossary: an illustrated dictionary of plant terms. Kew Publishing The leaves are usually between 15‚Äì45 cm long and 5-20mm wide, although larger dimensions of 80 cm long and 45mm wide have been suggested as upper limits. The racemes of R. cochinensis are 3‚Äì15 cm long, cylindrical, hairless (glabrous), erect and are found on terminal and axillary culms. Each raceme is either embraced at the base by, or projects beyond, a leaf arising from an inflated leaf-sheath. The peduncle at the base of each raceme is rough and widens as it approaches its apex, where the raceme is divided by fragile nodes between each rachis. The rachides are strongly inflated at around 2‚Äì3.5mm wide and 5-7mm between each node and bear pairs of spikelets abaxially: one sterile and attached with a pedicel fused to the internode, the other fertile and attached directly (sessile).Veldkamp, Koning, & Sosef. (1986). Generic Limitation of Rottboellia and Related Genera. 31, 281‚Äì307. The raceme tapers off with a number of reduced, sterile spikelets at the apex, which form a false panicle as they appear to be much-branched. The sterile, pedicelled spikelet in each pair is well developed at about 3-5mm long and is egg-shaped and dorsally flattened. The spikelet is enclosed by bracts called glumes which are hardened, smooth, obtuse, blunt, distinctly veined, glabrous and winged on the margins. The sterile spikelet is deciduous with the fertile spikelet, meaning they break off together with a central peg where the pair were attached transversely at each rachis node. The fertile, sessile spikelets are very similar to the sterile spikelets, being around 3.5-5mm long, ovate and dorsally flattened, although they are attached differently to the rachis. The glumes of these spikelets are dissimilar as the lower one is wider than the upper and is not winged, whereas the upper is V-shaped. The lower glume has 13 veins and is 2-keeled, unlike the upper which is 11-veined and singularly keeled. Both reach the apex of the florets but the lower glume apex is notched (emarginate) whereas the upper is acute. As with most members of the Poaceae family, the fertile spikelets contain florets with two lodicules, fleshy scales which open the glumes during flowering. These lodicules are the same size as the 3 anthers present in the florets at 2mm long and within them are the female parts of the flower consisting of 2 stigmas. Also typically for the Poaceae, the fruit formed is a single seed fused to the pericarp called a caryopsis, although in R. cochinchinensis the pericarp becomes free with time. The caryopsis is 3.5mm in length with the embryo around half the total length. The hilum, the scar where the caryopsis attached to the placenta, is point- like (punctiform) and the endosperm is covered with a mealy powder (farinose). The caryopsis is then disseminated with the rachis internode and a structure called the eliastome (callus knob) still attached. Rottboellia cochinchinensis has been found to vary in chromosome number, with diploid cells having either 20, 36, 40 or 60 chromosomes, so either x=10 or sometimes x=9 are common basic numbers.Millhollon, R.

Monocots: Poaceae. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-15332-2 Etymology The genus Rottboellia was named in honour of the Danish botanist Christen Friis Rottb√∏ll (1727‚Äì1797) by Carl Linnaeus the Younger in 1781 in the publication Supplementum Plantarum.Linnaeus, C. (1781). Supplementum Plantarum Part 2. Supplementum Plantarum, 126‚Äì127. The species epithet cochinchinensis traces its etymology back to the basionym Stegosia cochinchinensis, which was used by Jo√£o de Loureiro to denote the specimen he described being from Cochinchina, now part of Vietnam.Loureiro, J. de (1790). Flora Cochinchinensis, v. 1. In Flora cochinchinensis (Vol. 1).Clifford, H.T. & Bostock, P.B. (2007) Etymological Dictionary of Grasses. Springer, Germany. Clayton proposed the name Rottboellia cochinchinensis as a new combination for the species named Rottboellia exaltata, now as synonym of R. cochinchinensis. Due to a mistake by Linnaeus the Younger and the strict laws of nomenclature, the widely used R. exaltata combination had to be controversially discarded.Simon, B. K. 1982. (667) Proposal to conserve the species name Rottboellia exaltata L. f. (Poaceae). Taxon 31:564-565 Habitat and ecology Rottboellia cochinchinensis uses C4 carbon fixation during photosynthesis and as such is mostly found in warm tropical climates with high sunlight, generally in the tropics and between the northern and southern 20 ¬∞C isotherms.Strahan, R. E., Griffin, J. L., Reynolds, D. B., & Miller, D. K (2019). Interference between Rottboellia cochinchinensis and Zea mays. Weed Science Society of America. 48(2), 205‚Äì211.Spaunhorst, D. J., & Orgeron, A. J. (2019). Dry Heat and Exposure Time Influence Divine Nightshade and Itchgrass Seed Emergence. Agronomy Journal, 111(5), 2226. https://doi.org/10.2134/agronj2019.02.0072 Carbon fixation by this pathway allows plants to avoid the wasteful process of photorespiration and as such confers a competitive advantage to species such as R. cochinchinensis in high light intensity, high heat and low humidity conditions over C3 plants. The species can be found in a diverse array of habitats including grassland and marginal land, as well as being a major weed of perennial and rotation crops across the tropics. Globally there are least 18 crop species where R. cochinchinensis is considered an important weed including sugarcane (Saccharum), maize (Zea), upland rice (Oryza), cotton (Gossypium), soy (Glycine), Sorghum and peanuts (Arachis). Asian countries such as India do not seem to suffer from R. cochinchinensis as such a serious weed, suggesting that certain biotypes of the species are more vigorously competitive with crops than others. Rottboellia cochinchinensis is relatively shade tolerant, and also able to grow rapidly under high light exposure. The species is usually found at altitudes up to 2300m, with low temperatures often being the limiting factor above this, and favours acidic soils. It flowers all year long in tropical climates, but during July and August in the US and is a prodigious seed producer, sometimes producing over 2000 seeds per plant (although not all would be viable) and over 650 kg per hectare. Seed germination patterns are unclear and vary across the pantropical distribution of R. cochinchinensis, and recent research is aiming to better understand seedling emergence patterns in order to inform control regimes.Leon, R. G., Izquierdo, J., & Gonzalez-Andujar, J. L. (2015). Characterization and Modeling of Itchgrass (Rottboellia cochinchinensis) Biphasic Seedling Emergence Patterns in the Tropics. Weed Science, 63(3), 623‚Äì630. They are dispersed by floodwater, birds, small mammals and latterly by humans and vehicles. The eliastome (callus knob) which is disseminated with the caryopsis, contains oils which may attract ants and aid dispersal.Veldkamp, Koning & Sosef. (1986). Generic Limitation of Rottboellia and Related Genera. 31, 281‚Äì307. Distribution The natural distribution of R. cochinchinensis is somewhat unclear as the species seems to have been very successful at growing its range.Alves, E. C. C., Silva, M. A. S., Moro, F. V. Lu√≠s, P., Bachega, M. F., Moro, J. R., F, M. V., (2019). Identification and Characterization of Different Accessions of Itchgrass ( Rottboellia America 51(2), 177‚Äì180. Most sources assume the species is native to South-East Asia, as it was first described from specimens found in this area, although some sources cite India. It is now pantropical in distribution, being found across the Old World tropics from southern Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar and Indonesia to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and Australia as far as Queensland,Plants of the World Online  Rottboellia cochinchinensis (Lour.)

Introductions are speculated to have originated from the transportation of crop products and agricultural and forestry machinery,Veldman, J. W., & Putz, F. E. (2019).

D., & Renvoize, S. A. (1986). Genera graminum. Grasses of the World. Genera Graminum. Grasses of the World., 13. The tribe was defined morphologically by many characters including fragile racemes, subtended by a leaf-sheath, which bear pairs spikelets, one fertile and sessile and the other pedicelled and barren. Like many members of the tribe, the pairs of spikelets in R. cochinchinensis fall together with the internode at maturity. From this classification, the genus Rottboellia was thought to have evolved from a common ancestor with the Phacelurus and Coelorachis genera, with Rottboellia forming a sister clade to Zea. Clayton and Renvoize also recognised a subtribe Rottboelliinae which included the genera Coelorachis, Hackelochloa, Hemarthria and Elionurus, amongst others More recent evaluations of the Andropogoneae.Skendzic, E.

Phylogenetic methodologies have experienced difficulties in resolving evolutionary relationships within the tribe, and have pointed to rapid basal radiation and/or frequent hybridisation within the clade as possible causes. However, the merger of the genera Rottboellia and Coelorachis has been well supported. Skendzic et al.

Birch was the son of Thomas Birch of Birch Hall, Manchester, and his wife Alice . Raised a presbyterian, he was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1667, and also studied in Oxford, though not initially as a member of the university. (Under the Test Act, he could not graduate at Cambridge or matriculate at Oxford without conforming to the Church of England.) Having declared his conformity to the established church, he was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford by John Fell, Dean of Christ Church, matriculating on 12 May 1673, aged 21. He graduated B.A. March 1674, M.A. June 1674, B.D. 1684, D.D. 1688, and was made a chaplain of Christ Church by Dr. Fell. For a time he was curate of St Thomas the Martyr's Church, Oxford, then rector of St Ebbe's Church, Oxford and lecturer at Carfax, and subsequently chaplain to James, Duke of Ormonde. He became Chaplain to the House of Commons and a prebendary of Westminster Abbey in 1689. He later became Sub-Dean and Archdeacon of Westminster. When Thomas Tenison, rector of St James's Church, Piccadilly was appointed Bishop of Lincoln, the Bishop of London claimed the right to appoint to St. James's, appointing Birch on 11 July 1692. Queen Mary II, being satisfied that St. James's was a crown appointment, appointed William Wake. These conflicting claims led to litigation between Birch and Wake in the court of king's bench, and eventually the House of Lords decided the case on appeal, on 12 January 1695, in Wake's favour. According to Abel Boyer, Birch, a \\"great stickler for the high-church party\\", was probably ousted from St. James's after offending the court by preaching an unsuitable sermon on King William III's birthday. Shortly afterwards, on 19 March 1695, Birch was presented by the dean and chapter of Westminster to the vicarage of St Bride's Church, Fleet Street. Birch was married three times: firstly in 1686 to Mary (died 1688), daughter of the poet Edmund Waller; secondly in 1697 to Martha (died 1703), daughter of Samuel Vyner and widow of Francis Millington; thirdly to Sybil (died 1708), daughter of Humphrey Wyrley. With his third wife he had two sons, Humphrey Birch and John Wyrley Birch. He died on 2 July 1710, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Her research considers gender equality in global health. She has held various technical advisory positions for the World Health Organization. Allotey serves on the Paris Institute for Advanced Study World Pandemic Research Network who look to understand the societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Early life and education  Allotey was born in Morocco and spent her childhood in Ghana and the United Kingdom. Her parents are from Ghana, and her father was a career diplomat. She has said that her earliest ambition was to be a singer or a physician. When she was a teenager her father was arrested by militia forces during a political transition, and Allotey remembers hiding under her bed as the soldiers entered their home. The work of her parents inspired her lifelong career in engaging directly with communities to inform research and policy. She first studied psychology and nursing at the University of Ghana. She trained and registered as a nurse, public health nurse and a midwife in Ghana in 1988. In 1990 Allotey moved to Australia to further her university studies. Here she completed a postgraduate diploma and masters degree in public and community health at the University of Western Australia. She remained there for her doctoral studies, earning a doctoral degree in public health in 1996. As part of her doctoral research, she returned to Ghana, where she investigated why women did not attend antenatal clinics and what support they accessed as an alternative, particularly with co-morbidities of tropical diseases during pregnancy. She studied both the implementation of the safe motherhood initiative in antenatal health services and the practices of traditional healers and soothsayers.  Research and career  Allotey started her academic career as a research fellow in public health, first at the University of Western Australia and then at the University of Queensland. In 1997, Allotey was invited by the World Health Organization Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) to join their gender task force. In this capacity she contributed to the analysis of the impact of gender on various tropical diseases. She also investigated the physical and mental health of refugees, and the implications of their heath on their communities. She studied the prevalence of female genital mutilation in Ghana and Australia, and proposed that solutions must focus on enhancing women's rights and autonomy and promoting their agency to address the practice, rather than only focusing on the specific harm. She worked with the TDR again from 2006, when she was appointed to the Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee, and has since held various other technical advisory roles with the WHO. Around this time, Allotey moved to the United Kingdom and joined Brunel University London as Professor of Race, Diversity and Professional Practice. At Brunel, Allotey established one of the UK's first doctoral programmes in public health. In 2009 Allotey moved to Monash University Malaysia as Professor of Public Health at the Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine. Her research has considered the relationships between gender, equity, human rights, marginalisation and global health, with a focus on tropical health and non-communicable diseases. She has investigated how gender enables the Sustainable Development Goals, and how to engage with communities to co- produce research and influence policy related to their health. Together with Daniel Reidpath she founded the South East Asia Community Observatory (SEACO), a health and demographic surveillance system that was established in 2011. SEACO was supported by Monash University Malaysia, and looked to better understand how the rapidly changing population was impacting public health in Malaysia. In 2016 Allotey was part of the team led by WHO TDR to launch an implementation research based massive open online course which focused on the infectious diseases of poverty. The course looks to train public health researchers and disease control programme managers in how to improve health outcomes. Allotey was appointed to the Paris Institute for Advanced Study World Pandemic Research Network (WPRN) in May 2020. The WRPN was established in response to the SARS-CoV-2 crisis, and served to collate research and resources on the societal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Built in 1845 by early Californio settler Cayetano Juarez, the structure was originally a family house and was later converted to a restaurant and bar. After an ownership change in 2014, it underwent an extensive restoration which was completed in 2019. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. It is currently the home of a Mexican restaurant. Builder Cayetano Juarez Cayetano Juarez (1809-1883) was a Californio soldier in the Mexican Army, and later a Mexican government official. He received a land grant, Rancho Tulucay in the Napa Valley in 1840, where he kept herds of cattle and horses. He built his original adobe home at his rancho in 1840, which is no longer standing. In 1845, he built this larger adobe house, which still stands. Juraez employed about 400 Native American workers raising cattle and field crops on his surrounding land, and his children were raised speaking the local Native American Patwin language. His descendents were active in Napa Valley civic affairs for five generations. Construction The building is located less than half a mile east of the Napa River in what is now the city of Napa, California. It is at the beginning of the Silverado Trail, the first permanent road established in 1852 between Napa and Calistoga, California, which is near various mercury mines on the slopes of Mount Saint Helena. The widow openings reveal how thick the adobe walls are. Constructed in 1845 in a rectangular form primarily out of adobe brick, the building has walls that are three feet thick at the foundation, tapering to two feet thick above the attic. The structure of the building also incorporates wooden beams and exposed wooden rafters. The overhanging porch is supported by four heavy wooden posts. These posts, which are chamfered, measure 8\\" X 8\\", and three are original old growth redwood. The porch rafters are finished with decorative details. The building displays many vernacular characteristics of traditional adobe construction common during the Spanish and Mexican periods of California history. Shortly after the house was built, an adobe brick shed was added to the northeast corner of the building. History The building was the home of the family of Cayetano Juarez, his wife Maria de Jesus Higuerra and their descendents. The couple raised 11 children in the home. Considered community leaders, Juarez and his wife were well known for hosting rodeos and fiestas. After both died, their daughter Domilita Juarez Metcalf lived in the house and operated portions of the rancho as a farm until the 1920s. In the 1920s, the building was converted into a restaurant, and a series of modifications and minor additions began. About 1935, a stone and brick fireplace was added to the south side of the building. Around 1950, various additions made of shiplap planks allowed for expanded kitchen facilities. A restaurant and bar called the Old Adobe Hut operated in the building from 1951 until the late 1970s. During the 1970s, a fire caused moderate damage to the southern part of the building. During repairs, some ceiling joists were replaced and some timbers supporting the roof were reinforced. In 2002, the building was purchased by Tito Fuentes Jr., the son of former San Francisco Giants baseball player Tito Fuentes. The Fuentes family operated a Caribbean/Mexican restaurant in the building for some time. An Indian/Nepali restaurant called Taste of the Himalayas occupied the site until and somewhat after it was sold in 2014. The South Napa Earthquake of August, 2014 caused some cracking of plastered interior walls and the chimney that had been added in the 1950s. The adobe shed which had been built shortly after the building's construction also separated slightly from the main structure. Major renovation In 2014, Napa real estate investor George Altamura purchased the house, pledging to restore it to its 1848 appearance. Altamura had also bought and renovated the historic Uptown Theater in Napa. His grandson Justin Altamura gained ownership of the house and completed that renovation in early March, 2019. Justin Altamura made a considerable effort to study the preservation and restoration of historic adobe buildings, and decided to use traditional materials, techniques and accessories wherever possible. Over 300 large adobe bricks were used in the renovation \\"made by hand with clay, horse manure, and hay\\". He hired a team of expert Mexican masons to repair and replace the traditional mud mortar used between the original adobe bricks. Paint was stripped from original wood beams, door headers, floors and window frames. Interior walls were finished with plaster made out of sand, mud and pine needles. The exterior was whitewashed with a traditional product blended from lime, salt and water. Juliana Inman, a member of the Napa County Landmarks Board and an architect, praised the renovation, stating that the project gave the building \\"some cachet and some importance\\", observing that over decades \\"it‚Äôs been abused and converted to other uses and terrible additions made to it\\", concluding that \\"it‚Äôs just remarkable that it‚Äôs still here after all of that.\\" Describing Justin Altamura, Inman stated that \\"He‚Äôs listened very carefully. He‚Äôs so appreciative of the history of the building and the site. It‚Äôs like a gift to the community for him to be working on it.\\" Current use La Cheve, a Mexican restaurant, bakery and brewery, opened in the building in 2020. The opening was delayed for two months due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

He is known for his contributions to coalescence theory. He developed the test statistic now known as Tajima's D. Biography Fumio Tajima was born in ≈åkawa, in Japan's Fukuoka prefecture, in 1951. He graduated from high school in 1970, completed his undergraduate degree at Kyushu University in 1976, and received a Master's degree from the same institution in 1978. Tajima later stated that during his undergraduate degree he studied under Tsutomu Haga, and that he chose to study genetics after a meeting with him. In 1979 Tajima became a graduate student at the University of Texas in Houston, where he was supervised by Masatoshi Nei. He submitted his doctoral dissertation in 1983. Tajima returned to Kyushu university as a visiting scholar in 1983. Beginning in 1989, he worked at the National Institute of Genetics as an assistant professor and then an associate professor, before moving to the University of Tokyo in 1995. There, he became a professor in the Division of Biodiversity and Evolution, a unit of the Department of Biological Sciences. In 2008, he won the Kihara prize awarded by the Genetics Society of Japan. He retired in 2017. As a graduate student, Tajima was one of several researchers working independently on coalescence theory, which seeks to describe the evolutionary history of a single locus. His training in phylogenetics and population genetics put him in a good position to explore evolutionary trees with respect to single loci. In a 1983 paper, published in the journal Genetics, Tajima laid out findings that have since been described as among the \\"most important results in coalescence theory\\". These included the mean and the variance of the time between the present and the most recent common ancestor. In his paper, Tajima showed that well-known results of \\"classical\\" population genetics could be reproduced by using coalescence theory. While doing so, Tajima was likely unaware of the previous work of John Kingman in the same area. The 1983 paper has been described as among the \\"founding papers of modern population genetics\\". In 1989 Tajima published another influential paper in Genetics. This paper described a method to use the site frequency spectrum to estimate whether a population is evolving neutrally, evolving under directional selection, or evolving under balancing selection. This test statistic, which is known as Tajima's D, became a widely used test for neutrality among population geneticists.

The soundtrack was composed by Toshikazu Tanaka, who was previously employed at SNK and worked on project such as Fatal Fury: King of Fighters. Tanaka stated in an interview that his biggest challenge when composing for the project was getting the music quality nearly up to levels of other games at the time. Tanaka decided on using streaming playback for the music, as he felt he could not guarantee the high quality he desired with previous methods. The sound driver used was not designed with streaming in mind, proving difficult for Tanaka to do so and he considered modify the sound driver himself but could not make it so due to time schedule. However, Tanaka was able to do the work by himself. Sengoku 3 was later released for the Neo Geo AES system in October 2001. The North American AES release has since become one of the more expensive titles on the platform, with copies fetching over US$2200 on the secondary video game collecting market. In 2013, Sengoku 3 was digitally re-released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console service, courtesy of D4 Enterprise.

It partly evolved as a successor organisation of the New Hanseatic League that was set up to make up for the loss of the like-minded United Kingdom in the European political arena after Brexit. The Frugal Four experienced widespread media coverage throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, most likely first coined by Politico when Germany still belonged to this group of EU states. However, it was never founded as a transnational organisation like similar cooperations of countries in the European Union with shared interests. Position What unites the members of the Frugal Four are the wish for rebates as well as unique rules within the EU budget system rather than a universal system of rules that affects all members equally in nominal numbers. In an op-ed by Austria's chancellor Sebastian Kurz published in the Financial Times, he described the goals of the Frugal Four as a focus on budget contribution to the EU remaining stable, namely at a maximum of 1 per cent of the EU's gross national income), as well as devoting at least 25 per cent of it to fighting climate change. Furthermore, the Frugal Four wish for spending conditions that are tied to supporting the effective implementation of EU-wide policy objectives and the upholding of the rule of law. These positions came as a response to those countries within the bloc that see a need for higher individual contributions to the EU's budget after Brexit. The group of Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden also disagrees with the idea of Eurobonds, an hypothetical tool for joint bonds within the eurozone, as well as taking mutualised debts within the EU. As a consequence, the group stands opposed to the idea of the limited \\"corona bonds\\" as well. Frugal Four heads of government in 2020Context The Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has been described as the unofficial leader of the group. While this makes him unpopular in the rest of Europe, it attunes him to current Dutch politics: The Netherlands is proportionally a big contributor to the Union, while as a tax haven, it attracts money from other European countries. The retirement age in the Netherlands has been recently delayed to 67, making the Dutch unwilling to contribute to countries with lower ages.. The weakness of his VVD party prompts other European leaders to accommodate him as an alternative to Dutch Euroskeptics. Member change Germany was widely considered to be as fiscally conservative as the Frugal Four, hence the context in which the coalition of states was also sometimes referred to as the \\"Frugal Five\\". This changed in May 2020 the latest when Germany joined France's call for a ‚Ç¨500 billion recovery fund for the EU. This new measure to tackle the pandemic and its consequences would lead to shared borrowing with other EU member countries, a position that Germany tried to avoid until that point. Later the original group's demands were supported by Finland.

The bank is owned operated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI), and has 206 branches nationwide. MADB provides loans to a sizable number of rural households, serving 1.87 million customers in 2012. MADB loan products typically cover farmers' short-term working capital needs (e.g., purchase of seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides; payment of salaries for farm workers; and lease of agriculture equipment).

She was one of the first women to explore the Arctic and have charge of a polar expedition. Raised in an polyamorous household in Kostroma, she attended the first women's gymnasium in Russia from 1907 to 1914 and then studied to become a teacher. After taking workers courses under Lenin's wife Nadezhda Krupskaya, she taught collectivism in the Ufa Governorate before settling in Leningrad in 1921 to study at the Geographical Institute. For eight years, she studied geography and biology, participating in numerous field trips on polar research. Graduating in 1929, Demme went to work at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute and participated in a two- year expedition to Franz Josef Land, during which she was the only woman in the group. Chosen to lead an expedition to Severnaya Zemlya, known then as the Kamenev Islands, she and her team of three men mapped the western part of the archipelago and conducted research on the plants and animals. Returning to Leningrad in 1934, she researched the commercial collective farming potential of animals of the north and for several seasons studied black foxes and the possibilities of breeding eiders. Earning her Candidate's Degree in biology in 1946, she became a professor but was discontent to remain in the classroom and continued to make research trips until she retired in 1959. In her retirement, she painted, and planted a large garden of flowers and trees, which she maintained until her death in 1977. Early life Nina was born in 1902 in Kostroma in the Russian Empire to Maria Ivanovna Ryabtsova and Ludwig Fedorovich Demme. She was an illegitimate child of a polyamorous household which was made up of her father's first wife and nine children, and her mother and mother's five children. Her half-siblings were Valya and Kolya by her mother's first husband, a German surnamed Huber. Nina, Julia, and Seryozha were full siblings from her mother's relationship with her father. Because her blood siblings were all illegitimate, they were registered with the family patronymic Petrovna, after her godfather Petr Ryabtsov, and with their mother's surname, Ryabtsov. Forged papers, showing her name as Nina Petrovna Demme-Ryabtseva, allowed Demme to be the only child to carry her father's surname or enter high school (gymnasium). Her father was a German noble, originally named Ludwig , who changed his surname to Demme and arrived in Russia where he ran a bicycle shop in Galich. Soon he relocated to Kostroma and began a relationship with Ryabtsova, who managed a brewery left to her by her first husband. After he had sent for his first family in Germany, the blended families rented the house which would later become the Pushkin Library in Kostroma. Ryabtsova, Ludwig, and her children occupied the top floor of the building, and his first family lived in the garden house. Later, he built a house for the mixed family at #23 Pastukhovskaya. The relationships between his wives and children were friendly and they all worked together on the farm, which produced poultry, as well as fruits and flowers for local sale. Ludwig Demme was fond of birds and raised several rare breeds of pigeons, for which he was widely known. Education After completing her primary education, Demme entered the private Grigorov Female Gymnasium (), the first women's high school in Russia. The school was funded by nobles from the Kostroma Oblast, but because her documents listed Demme as the daughter of a peasant, she was ridiculed. Girls who attended the school were preparing to become teachers and studied dance, music, and needlework, as well as French, German, and Russian languages; geography; literature; mathematics; physics; and religion. She graduated in 1914 and then entered the teacher training seminary in Kostroma. In 1917, while participating in a community mowing project during her schooling, Demme learned of the Bolsheviks and quickly became a founding member of the Komsomol in Kostroma. By 1919, she was a leader in the Komsomol, entering the labor school commune and participating in the provincial committee. In 1920, she went to Moscow to take workers courses under Nadezhda Krupskaya, Lenin's wife, and studied collectivism. When she completed the courses, she was sent to the Ufa Governorate in the Ural Mountains to pass on the information to the masses. In 1921, Demme moved to Leningrad to study at the Geographical Institute. Among her instructors were Lev Berg, , Bia≈Çynicki- Birula Vladimir Bogoraz, , , Boris Fedtschenko, Alexander Fersman, Dimitri Nalivkin, and . For eight years she studied at the institute, which later became the geography department of Leningrad University. During research trips, she participated in expeditions to the Caucasus and Crimea and worked on projects including road construction in Leningrad and dog training along the railway from Termez to Dushanbe. In 1926, Demme led an expedition to the Kara Sea; in 1927, she conducted research in the Urals; afterwards, she completed field work in Central Asia around Amu Darya to prepare for land reforms. While she was in school, she met and married fellow student and polar explorer . Her husband had been part of the rescue attempt in 1928 to save Umberto Nobile, an Italian polar explorer, and his crew after they crashed their dirigible balloon.

Photograph indicates these were the first photos sent from the expedition: left Demme taking water samples; Middle the camp; right Demme seated Locations of Demme's expeditions in the Arctic. In 1929, Demme graduated and went to work at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute when it was founded in 1930. Because of her extensive experience and research background, Demme was selected to participate in an expedition on the icebreaker George Sedov, which planned to winter on Franz Josef Land. Ivanov was sent to manage the polar station in Tikhaya Bay on Hooker Island, the 11 scientists being led by Otto Schmidt. Demme was the only woman among them and international news coverage at the time claimed she was the first woman to have explored the Arctic. Her work involved both geographical and biological studies, and the crew wintered for two years on the island. When not making expeditions to study the wildlife and plants, Demme assisted the hydrologist in his measurements. During the expedition, Demme and Ivanov divorced, and she married another of the scientists. When they returned from the trip, that marriage ended, and she married Gabriel Ignatievich Ioylev, a radio operator. Nina Demme and her crew preparing to leave for Severnaya Zemlya in 1932 In 1932, she led a team of three men, including a hunter, meteorologist, and her husband, Ioylev, the radio operator, to winter in the Kamenev Islands, and newspapers reported that she had been the first woman to lead a polar expedition. The group sailed on the Roussanov, arriving on 14 August and settling into the cabin which had a large bedroom with bunk beds and a library, as well a large dining table, where they listened to concerts and news broadcasts each evening during dinner. She was made governor of the archipelago and had the authority to direct commerce, immigration, and other affairs of state. The group was to remain one winter and evaluate the commercial possibilities for the flora and fauna of the islands. They gathered geological and botanical samples, studied the various animals on their expeditions, and mapped the western part of Severnaya Zemlya. As icebreakers were unable to reach, them the team ended up wintering a second year in the Arctic. Various mishaps befell the crew, including one when, while out hunting, the men mistook Demme for a polar bear and she began to sing an aria from La traviata so they would know she was not their prey. In September 1934, Alexander Alexiev, a government pilot, flew from Siberia and was able to extract Demme and her crew, as well as Boris Lavrov and his pilot, who had been on an expedition of the Lena River before their plane crashed and they walked 185 miles to reach the Kamenev station. =Academic career= Returning to Leningrad, Demme began post-graduate studies at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, where she also taught courses in biology and zoology. She was interested in researching the commercial collective farming potential of animals of the north and for several seasons studied black foxes. Because she could not get the Institute to finance her expeditions, Demme chartered small fishing boats to take her to remote Arctic huts so that she could carry out her research. Beginning around 1940, she utilized methods established in Iceland to create experimental eider farms in Novaya Zemlya and on Vaygach Island. By setting up nesting shelters and killing the predators of the birds, locals under her leadership were able to collect of eiderdown over a five year period. Demme completed her dissertation, –ì–Ω–µ–∑–¥–æ–≤—ã–µ –∫–æ–ª–æ–Ω–∏–∏ –≥–∞–≥–∏ –æ–±—ã–∫–Ω–æ–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –Ω–∞ –ù–æ–≤–æ–π –ó–µ–º–ª–µ –∏ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è –≥–∞–≥–∞—á—å–µ–≥–æ —Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–∞ (Nesting Colonies of the Common Eider on Novaya Zemlya and the Organization of the Eiderdown Economy) in 1946, earning her Candidate's Degree in biology. Demme was made an associate professor in 1949, but did not like the confinement of the classroom. She continued to hire small commercial vessels to allow her to study wildlife in the Arctic into the 1950s. In 1949, she conducted research in the Kandalaksha Nature Reserve on the White Sea, extending her work on eiders. At the reserve, she attempted to develop domesticated hatcheries, which she had unsuccessfully tried to establish in Novaya Zemlya. Though successful, the group of chicks she brought back to Leningrad at the end of the season failed to thrive and all died. In 1952, Demme made her last trip to the Arctic, working in the northern parts of the Gulf of Ob in Siberia, and focusing on raising animals there. She did not return to the Kandalaksha Reserve, though others continued to study eider chicks there. Though she was not involved, her experimental eiderdown farms operated until 1954, when they were closed and the native inhabitants of Novaya Zemlya were removed in preparation for nuclear tests. In 1959, she retired and wrote her autobiography. She was allowed to buy a summer house on the Black Sea coast and chose a place between Sochi and Tuapse near Volkonskaya, where she built a home and an extensive garden, which had various kinds of flowers and trees. An accomplished musician and skilled artist, she also created paintings. Death and legacy Demme died on 16 March 1977 in Leningrad from phlegmon after she was given an injection for a congenital heart defect. She was cremated there, and her remains were taken to Kostroma for burial. The family was unable to convince local authorities to allocate marble for a tombstone. In 2017, her grave was located in the local cemetery on Kostromskaya Street. She is remembered as one of the first women polar explorers. There has been renewed interest in the 21st century in her work on eiderdown production.

He was married to the soprano and composer Lisa Lehmann from 1894 until her death in 1918. His grandsons were the conductor Steuart Bedford and the composer David Bedford. Composer Night Piece No 2 (The Shepherd), score published in 1925 Herbert Bedford attended the City of London School and trained at the Guildhall School of Music.Leach, Gerald. British Composer Profiles, British Music Society, 2012 He composed the one-act opera Kit Marlowe (1897), as well as orchestral, choral and chamber music, including a distinctive body of work for solo voice and chamber ensemble. Best known of these was Night Piece No 2 (The Shepherd), for voice (contralto or mezzo), flute, oboe, and piano, which won a Carnegie Award in 1925 and was published as part of the Carnegie Collection of British Music.King's College, London Bedford was also one of the first ‚Äúserious‚Äù composers (other than Gustav Holst) to write original works for military band. However, his most individual musical interest was in unaccompanied song. With the Romantic tradition (especially Schubert, Schumann and Wagner), intricate accompaniment had come to represent \\"the internal response to what was being declaimed externally by the voice\\", leading to an over reliance on the accompaniment. Bedford was concerned with ‚Äúfreeing song from the tyranny of the accompaniment‚Äù, and in his 1923 Essay on Modern Unaccompanied Song he listed 41 songs, by Frederic Austin, Eugene Bonnar, Harry Farjeon, Francesca Hall, Jane Joseph, Liza Lehmann, George Oldroyd, Cyril Scott, John Tobin, Felix White, Gerrard Williams and himself. Published as a set by F & B Goodwin,'Unaccompanied Song' in Musical News and Herald, Vol 62-63 (1923) p 501 these were laid out with each phrase on its own single line (regardless of length), to make the musical form clearer.Bedford, Herbert. 'Song in a single line', in Music and Letters V (1924) p 109-120 Some, including Yeats settings by Bedford, were performed during the Goossens Chamber Concert series at the Aeolian Hall in 1923 by contralto Esther Coleman. Bedford's interest in unaccompanied song was less akin to German expressionist Sprechstimme techniques (as some have suggested) and closer in spirit to monodic folksong and oriental melody. In 1935 Bedford won the Brahms Medal, the first English composer to do so, though the reasons for the award (given to eight international composers that year rather than the usual one German or Austrian) were more political then musical. This was connected to the controversial founding of the Permanent Council for the International Co- operation of Composers under Richard Strauss, of which Bedford acted as co- Secretary. This organisation was accused at the time of furthering Nazi Party cultural ambitions, set up in opposition to the non-political International Society for Contemporary Music.Fanning, David (ed.). The Routledge Handbook to Music under German Occupation, 1938-1945 Bedford defended its neutrality.Bedford, Herbert. Letter to The Musical Times, February 1936, p 159 Author, artist and inventor Bedford became known as an artist before he was successful as a composer, exhibiting his works in London, Paris and New York. He mainly produced miniatures and small portraits, such as those collected in his book The Heroines of George Meredith (1914) and the coloured frontispiece and illustrations for his wife's posthumous memoirs, published in 1919. As an author Bedford published Robert Schumann, His Life and Works in 1925. Marrying text and images, the Chart of the Arts came out in 1938 in the form of a folding linen-backed chart, illustrating music, painting, poetry, sculpture and architecture from the 5th Century BC to 1900. Copies are now hard to get hold of. During the First World War, Herbert Bedford held a commission with the Royal Navel Volunteer Reserve, where he was concerned with London's anti-aircraft defences. While there he invented an anti aircraft ranging device which the War Office adopted for the instruction of all AA gunnery officers. Personal life and family Bedford married Lisa Lehmann after she had retired as a singer in 1894, when she turned to composing. They had two sons, the older one died in training during the First World War.Banfield, Stephen.

By 1989, a new plot of land was selected. The project was commissioned by the Los Angeles Redevelopment Agency as the final landscape for the Los Angeles Open Space Network. Ground breaking for the park took place on July 18, 1989, and construction lasted until 1993. The park was designed by Lawrence Halprin with The Jerde Partnership architects. After its creation, Grand Hope Park became the first new park built in Downtown Los Angeles since 1870, when Pershing Square was built. Features Grand Hope Park is located on the Los Angeles campus of the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising. The park was designed as a collection of \\"outdoor rooms\\" with the purpose of \\"bringing functional art and nature to an urban setting.\\" It consists of decorative sidewalks, two fountains, a clock tower, pergolas, a children's playground, and displays of various artists' works.

He was educated in the Page Corps of His Imperial Majesty, where on September 1, 1902 he was accepted into service.–ü–∞–∂–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∫–æ—Ä–ø—É—Å. –í—ã–ø—É—Å–∫ 1904 –≥. On August 9, 1904, V.

Two years later he was awarded the rank of lieutenant, and another year later, as he successfully passed the entrance exams, V.E. Garf was enrolled as a student of the Imperial Nikolaev Military Academy, which in 1910 he graduated from the first category with the appointment to the General Staff.–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è –ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —à—Ç–∞–±–∞. –í—ã–ø—É—Å–∫ 1910 –≥.

Verkhovsky. At the same time, many future leaders of the White movement turned out to be graduates of the 1910 Academy: Pyotr Wrangel, M. M. Zinkevich, N. V. Nagaev, V. I. Sidorin, A. L. Nosovich, A. N. Vagin. From November 1, 1910, for two years, Staff Captain Wilhelm Evgenievich was serving the qualified command of the company in the Life Guards of the J√§ger Regiment, according to which on November 26, 1912 he was seconded to the headquarters of the 3rd Army Corps (Russian Empire), stationed in Vilna, where he assumed office senior adjutant.–õ–µ–π–±-–≥–≤–∞—Ä–¥–∏–∏ –ï–≥–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–æ–ª–∫. –°–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏ –æ—Ñ–∏—Ü–µ—Ä–æ–≤ –Ω–∞ 1909, 1910 –≥–≥. Participation in the First World War With the outbreak of the First World War and the formation in July 1914 of the units of the Vilnius District of the 1st Army (Russian Empire), Captain Wilhelm Garf took over the position of senior adjutant of the Quartermaster General of Staff. As part of the Northwestern Front, the 1st Army (Russian Empire), under the command of General Paul von Rennenkampf, entered East Prussia on August 4, 1914. Already in the first weeks of the war, William Garf distinguished himself in the Battle of Gumbinnen. On December 6, 1914, he was awarded the rank of lieutenant colonel, and in February of the following year he was appointed senior adjutant to the commander of the 26th Infantry Division (commander - Major General P. A. Tikhonovich). The division was part of the 2nd Army Corps (Russian Empire), which since August 8 has been part of the 1st Army (Russian Empire). In February, the division advanced to Poland, where V.E. Garf distinguished himself in fierce battles in the area of the town of Sejny (02.25.02.1915), the settlement of Krasnopol (03.15.1915), and the city of Suwalki.–¢–∏—Ö–æ–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –ü–µ—Ç—Ä –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤–∏—á On September 10, 1915, Lieutenant Colonel V.E. Garf was appointed chief of staff of the 69th Infantry Division, which was part of the 21st Army Corps (3rd Army of the Southwestern Front). The division belonged to the second stage of mobilization and was formed only in 1914, that is, after the declaration of war. This meant that the percentage of untrained soldiers in it was much higher than in the divisions of the first stage, which were formed in peacetime. Nevertheless, the division quickly earned a reputation as a reliable connection, having been on the South-Western Front since 1914, where it participated in battles for Lviv and in the siege of the Austrian fortress Przemysl. The following year, the division fought in the Carpathians, then in the summer it passed a difficult route of retreat from Galicia. Wilhelm Garf assumed the post of chief of staff of the division in those days when in the beginning of autumn 1915, as part of 21 corps, she was transferred to the Western Front in the region of Krevo-Smorgon. The division remained here for more than two years, until the dissolution of the imperial army in March 1918 after the Bolsheviks signed the Brest Peace. All this time she waged bloody defensive battles for Smorgon.–û–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∞ –°–º–æ—Ä–≥–æ–Ω–∏–ì–∞–≤—Ä–∏–ª–æ–≤ –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á The head of the division, Lieutenant General A.P.

Garf, was characterized very highly: ‚ÄúWhat are you quoting?‚Äù In the cases of combat operations, the division in the field and in headquarters activities understands skillfully and quickly, and for the success of orientation in battle neglected the danger. As the chief of staff, quite in place, with great tact, with initiative. He treats his subordinates cordially and fairly, and although he is gentle, he is persistent in his requirements.

Then Wilhelm Evgenievich received his last military rank in the old army - Colonel (order 15.08.1917). After the October Revolution, Colonel V.E. Garf, in the previous post of Chief of Staff of the 69th Division, remained at the forefront. In the conditions of the collapse of the army, the division was among the few that did not lose their combat effectiveness and controllability. On January 30, 1918, Commander-in-Chief N.V. Krylenko requested Wilhelm Garf to Petrograd, where he appointed him assistant clerk of the Main Directorate of the General Staff. In March 1918, simultaneously with the signing of the Brest Peace, one of the conditions of which was the demobilization of the imperial army, the capital of the republic, and with it the General Directorate of the General Staff were transferred to Moscow. Petrograd and V.E. Garf left Petrograd and V.E. Almost two months later, on May 8, 1918, instead of the Main Directorate of the General Staff, the General Headquarters was created. In it, as a volunteer, Wilhelm Evgenievich took the post of head of the Austrian branch at the Military Statistics Division of the Operations Directorate.–í–°–û –û–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª–∞ –í—Å–µ—Ä–æ–≥–ª–∞–≤—à—Ç–∞–±–∞–õ—É—Ä—å–µ –í. –ú. –ì–†–£: –¥–µ–ª–∞ –∏ –ª—é–¥–∏ —Å—Ç—Ä. 609 In the service of the Workers 'and Peasants' Red Army Having believed the calls of the former General Mikhail Dmitriyevich Bonch-Bruyevich, V.E. Garf voluntarily joined the Red Army and on October 8, 1918 was appointed to the headquarters of the Eastern Front. While the front was commanded by Sergey Kamenev, Wilhelm Evgenievich was the head of the operational intelligence department of the front headquarters and field control. With the arrival of the new commander Alexander Samoylo on July 7, 1919, and before the front was disbanded on January 15, 1920, V. E. Garf was the permanent chief of staff of the Eastern Front. After Alexander Samoylo, the front was sequentially commanded by Sergei Kamenev (repeatedly), Pavel Pavlovich Lebedev, Mikhail Frunze, Vladimir Olderogge. Under the conditions of a constant change of commanders of the Eastern Front, V. E. Garf managed to ensure continuity and controllability of the troops. It's a rare case when one chief of staff ‚Äúoutlived‚Äù several of his immediate superiors, who didn't always even manage to get involved in the situation. After the successful Ufa operation (May 25 - June 20), V. E. Garf, as a recognized specialist in the \\"field of tactics of military operations using infantry\\", led the headquarters during the most active offensive operations of the Eastern Front. Under his leadership, the Zlatoust (June 24 - July 13) and Chelyabinsk (July 17 - August 4) operations were developed and successfully conducted. On August 14, 1919, the southern group of armies of the Eastern Front was transformed into the Turkestan Front. The remaining front forces were tasked with defeating A.V. Kolchak and liberating Siberia. The headquarters developed and carried out the Peter and Paul Operation with great skill from August to November 1919. During the offensive, Tobolsk (October 22), Petropavlovsk (October 31), Omsk (November 14) were liberated. In December, Barnaul (11), Novonikolaevsk (14), Tomsk (20) were taken. Finally, on January 7, 1920, Krasnoyarsk fell. The Peter and Paul offensive led to the complete defeat of the main forces of the army of A.V. Kolchak. The Eastern Front has fully fulfilled its task, and by directive of the High Command of January 6, 1920, the Office of the Eastern Front was disbanded on January 15. For the final destruction of the scattered remnants of the Kolchak army, the 5th Army was left under the command of Mikhail Matiyasevich. Before the latter took office on February 8, 1920, V.E. Garf commanded the army for some time, after which he was appointed chief of its headquarters. By the summer of 1920, the last centers of white resistance were suppressed, and on June 23, 1920, Wilhelm Evgenievich was recalled to Moscow. The main battles of the Civil War were completed. For successfully prepared and conducted operations on the Eastern Front of the Civil War, V.E. Garf was awarded the Order of the Red Banner in 1921.–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –Ω–∞–≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥—ë–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –û—Ä–¥–µ–Ω–æ–º –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ó–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–∏ : –ì–∞—Ä—Ñ –í–∏–ª—å–≥–µ–ª—å–º –ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω—å–µ–≤–∏—á Being a non-partisan representative of a social class alien to the Bolsheviks, and also an ethnic German, for many years Wilhelm Evgenievich held various leadership positions in the headquarters of the Red Army solely because of his professionalism. Over the years, he was: assistant to the chief of the operational management of the field headquarters of the RVSR (07/15/1920 - 01/14/1921); the executive affairs of the head of the organizational management of the headquarters of the Red Army (01/14/1921 - 09.24.1921) the second assistant to the chief of staff of the Red Army (09.24.1921-01.05.1924) (he was in charge of accounting, organization and mobilization; he was subordinated to the departments for command staff, organizational and mobilization). In May 1924, when the accounting and organizational departments were separated into an independent Organization and Accounting Department, V.E. Garf was transferred to the post of its head. In October 1925, Wilhelm Evgenievich became an assistant to the head of the Office of military schools of the Red Army, but after 2 months he was appointed deputy head of the Main Directorate of the Red Army. In January 1927 he took the post of deputy chief of supply of the Red Army, from where in November 1929 he was transferred to the position of assistant chief of arms of the Red Army.–í—Å—è –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ –Ω–∞ 1924 –≥.–ë–∞–±–∞–Ω–∫–æ–≤ –ê. –í. –†—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –®—Ç–∞–±–∞ –†–ö–ö–ê 1921‚Äî1924 –≥–≥.: —Å–æ—Ü–∏–æ–∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω—ã–π –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑ –∏ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Ä–æ–ª—å–ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —à—Ç–∞–± –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–π –ê—Ä–º–∏–∏ (–ì–® –ö–ê) In February 1931, V.E.

Podbelsky at the People's Commissariat of Communications of the USSR. At the same time, Wilhelm Evgenievich headed the command faculty of the Academy, he was assigned the highest service category K-14. In September 1934, he was appointed to his last post - the head of the Academy of Communications named after V.N. Podbelsky. With the introduction of military ranks in the Red Army in September 1935, and order of the USSR People's Commissar of Defense No. 2395 dated November 20, 1935, V.E. Garf was awarded the personal rank of division commander, which can be regarded as a certain reduction. The highest service category K-14 assumed the assignment of a rank not lower than the commander of the 2nd rank. By the arbitrariness of K.E. Voroshilov, such a decrease affected almost all the heads of military academies, with the exception, perhaps, only of A.I.–ó–Ω–∞–∫–∏ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–∏—è –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å–ª—É–∂–∞—â–∏—Ö –†–ö–ö–ê –ø–æ —Å–ª—É–∂–µ–±–Ω—ã–º –∫–∞—Ç–µ–≥–æ—Ä–∏—è–º 1924‚Äî1934 –≥–≥.–ü—Ä–∏–∫–∞–∑ –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∞—Ä–∞ –æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã –°–æ—é–∑–∞ –°–°–† –ø–æ –ª–∏—á–Ω–æ–º—É —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤—É –∞—Ä–º–∏–∏ –æ—Ç 20.11.1935 –≥. ‚Ññ 2395 ¬´–û –≤–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∑–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–µ–≥–æ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∞ –†–ö–ö–ê¬ª–ß–µ—Ä—É—à–µ–≤ –ù. –°. 1937 –≥–æ–¥. –≠–ª–∏—Ç–∞ –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–π –ê—Ä–º–∏–∏ –Ω–∞ –ì–æ–ª–≥–æ—Ñ–µ : –°–ª–æ–≤–æ –æ –í–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏–ª–æ–≤–µ Wilhelm Evgenievich led the Academy in those years when the difficult process of merging the Moscow Electrotechnical Institute of Communications and the Academy named after V.N.

Garf's son Eugene, a fifth-year student of the engineering department of the Military Academy of Chemical Protection, a second-level military technician, was arrested. The investigation did not take much time. Whether it was possible to break the commander or not, now does not establish. One way or another, but he kept silent that his cousin L. L. Kerber, who was arrested ten days earlier, is in one of the neighboring cells of the internal prison on Lubyanka, and thereby saved his life. The NKVD investigators did not find out about the close family ties of the two prisoners arrested almost simultaneously, although on various occasions. Garf's son Eugene was among those rare lucky ones who were sentenced to a long prison term. By a resolution of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR of May 28, 1955, V. E. Garf was completely rehabilitated.

She was the mother of politician Thomas McQuesten.  Biography  McQuesten was born Mary Jane Baker on October 10, 1849 in Brantford in what was then Upper Canada to parents Reverend Thomas Baker and Mary Jane McIlwaine. She attended Newmarket County Grammar School and later Mrs. Burns' Ladies Collegiate Institute in Toronto. McQuesten never received a formal university education. Mary met Isaac Baldwin McQuesten in 1869. The two married on June 18, 1873, though Mary broke off the engagement at least once. Their eldest child, Mary Baldwin McQuesten, was born in 1874. The couple had six more children between 1876 and 1885: Calvin, Hilda-Belle, Ruby Baker, Muriel Fletcher, Thomas Baker, and Margaret Edna. Muriel Fletcher only lived to 21 months, dying in 1882. Following the death of his father in 1885, Isaac McQuesten inherited Willowbank House and the McQuesten family moved in. Mary McQuesten changed the name of the house to Whitehern. In 1882, McQuesten was elected to the board of the Women's Foreign Missionary Society. She was elected president of the society in 1893. In 1898, McQuesten helped to form the Woman's Home Missionary Society which helped to minister to people, especially those involved in the gold rush, in the Canadian north and northwest. Despite McQuesten's opposition, the Women's Foreign Missionary Society and the Woman's Home Missionary Society merged in 1914 to become the Women's Missionary Society. Isaac McQuesten died in 1888 leaving Mary McQuesten a single mother of six children between the ages of 2 and 14. Isaac was an alcoholic and his death was rumoured to have been a suicide. His death left the McQuesten family in severe debt. In 1889, McQuesten proposed the founding of a chapter of the YWCA in Hamilton. The Hamilton YWCA Building opened on May 1, 1889. McQuesten was a member of several other religious women's institutions including the National Council of Women and the Victorian Order of Nurses. Despite these feminist leanings, McQuesten was never publicly associated with the women's suffrage movement. McQuesten was a devout Presbyterian her entire life. In 1923, she spoke out against church union. Her Presbyterian church, Hamilton Presbytery, similarly resisted joining the United Church. On December 7, 1934, McQuesten died of a cerebral hemorrhage.  Legacy  McQuesten's letters have been influential in Canadian humanities and social studies. The letters demonstrate the ways in which letter writing could keep distant family members aware of each other's lives in the Victorian era. The letters also provide insight into the life of a single Victorian mother and into post-colonial Victorian attitudes. McQuesten's collected writings, including missionary texts and letters, have been compiled with a biography by Mary J. Anderson called The Life Writings of Mary Baker McQuesten: Victorian Matriarch. McQuesten's former home is now preserved as a museum, the Whitehern Historic House and Garden, in Hamilton.

Oleksiak later earned a master's degree in Education from Saint Joseph's. Oleksiak was a special education teacher in the Upper Merion Area School District for over three decades.

He became the first Pennsylvania Cabinet secretary to take office without Senate approval. Oleksiak joined the Department following a performance audit that showed almost $180 million in taxpayer dollars was spent under his leadership of Manderino on a botched modernization project for unemployment compensation.

Richthofen, then an observer with no victories to his credit, would go on to become the highest-scoring ace of World War I. Zeumer was Richthofen's first pilot, and in August 1915, the two men flew a large battle plane in Ostend, Belgium, as part of the Brieftauben- Ableitung-Ostende (BAO) unit. Zeumer was with Richthofen during the latter's first aerial combat, in which they tried unsuccessfully to down an Allied reconnaissance place. Richthofen wrote of the experience: Richthofen, M. (1969). The Red Baron. (P. Kilduff, Trans.). (S. Ulanoff, Ed.). Doubleday & Company. (Original work published 1917) Despite this spat, Richthofen and Zeumer had a close relationship, with Richthofen referring to Zeumer as \\"my good friend\\" and writing that Zeumer \\"flew with rare skill.\\" When Richthofen decided to move from being an observer to a pilot, it was Zeumer who taught him how to fly. In early 1916, both men served with bombing unit Kampfgeschwader 2. Zeumer achieved four confirmed victories there, the first of which was a French Nieuport Scout over Douaumont on 11 April 1916. In June 1916, Zeumer was shot down by the French. Although only slightly injured by the crash, he broke his right thigh in a car accident while being transported out,Richthofen, K. (2001). Mother of eagles: The war diary of Baroness von Richthofen (S. Hayes Fischer, Trans.). Schiffer Publishing Ltd. (Original work published 1937) under what Richthofen described as \\"quite stupid circumstances.\\" At some point Zeumer was promoted to Oberleutnant, the highest lieutenant officer rank in the German armed forces. In May 1917, he joined Jasta Boelcke, a fighting unit founded by famed German ace Oswald Boelcke. Personal life Following the accident that injured his leg in mid-1916, Zeumer developed diabetes. Because his thigh did not heal properly, he was left with one leg nine centimeters shorter than the other, and had to use a walking stick. Zeumer's comrades nicknamed him \\"the lunger\\" because he suffered from tuberculosis, which in those days was fatal. Knowing his days were numbered, Zeumer gained a reputation for being a reckless flier. This attitude earned him the nickname \\"Black Cat,\\" and he had a black cat insignia painted on his plane. Death Oblt. Georg Zeumer was killed on 17 June 1917, while attacking a British R.E.8 two-seater near Honnecourt-sur-Escaut, France. The plane was crewed by Lt. Douglas and Lt. E. O.

Houghton's combat report reads: Manfred von Richthofen mentioned Zeumer's death in a letter later published in Ein Heldenleben, a 1920 compilation of his autobiography (The Red Fighter Pilot) and related writings.

The band consists of The King (John Steen) on guitar and vocals, The Burgher (Ulrik Bostedt) on bass, and The Vicar (Tony Samuelsson) on drums. Nicknamed The Barons of High Energy Rock 'n' Roll, the trio frequently delve into rock and roll, hard rock, and heavy metal. The band stands apart from other rock groups by donning masks and headgear during performances to match their individual personas. Furthermore, members of the group are not replaced; with previous members always able to link up and play with the band. Fans of M√§rvel belong to different provinces of The M√§rvel Army fan club, which is prominent in 12 countries. Provinces are organized by club presidents, which also have their own masked personas. Band HistoryFormation and First Album (2002 - 2006)= The official M√§rvel logo. The group came together in 2002 when the trio of John Steen, Ulrik Bostedt, and Tony Samuelsson spent a year as exchange students in Colorado, USA. They formed under the name of M√§rvel, inspired by the Marvel comic book heroes with a metal umlaut to help distinguish themselves from the company and reflect their gritty, hard-rock sound. Working together on music rather than their grades, they released the vinyl Marvellous through the independent music label New York Powerhitters. They stuck together upon returning to their howntown of Link√∂ping, releasing two EPs Heroine Tracks and Bedlam At The Embassy. They donned superhero costumes and went by the original titles of Vocalo, The Ambassador, and Animalizer. They released their first full-length album in 2005, Five Smell City, after a nickname for the city of Link√∂ping. Following the release of the album the group toured around Europe while performing covers for their upcoming Unleashed! EP. =A Growing Following (2006 - 2013)= M√§rvel with drummer/producer Fred Estby while on tour with Dregen. Unleashed! was released in 2006 to moderate reviews, featuring covers of bands such as Bon Jovi and KISS. By now their songs were receiving airtime in Europe, with fanbases establishing themselves elsewhere in Scandinavia and Germany. With another major release just around the corner in 2007, the group adopted new stage names of The King, The Vicar, and Speedo. Due to travel restrictions, another bass player, The Aviator, was recruited for touring purposes as the band released their second full-length album Thunderblood Heart in September 2007. The album had a very positive response, with the first single \\"I Wanna Know You (just a little bit better)\\" getting a music video with GBG Wrestling. The group continued to tour through 2008 and played with members of The Backyard Babies at the Dreamhack gaming festival in June. The following year, they released the single \\"A Pyrrhic Victory\\" with an accompanying tour in Germany. The single was a hit, getting a music video which featured in an interview on Swedish TV channel 24Corren. Portions of the Warhawks of War tour were spliced together to make a road movie. Actor Johannes Brost was a fan of the new album, filming an unboxing, a first-listen, and reaction music video of the track \\"Hello!\\" to help promote it. Fisheye view of M√§rvel live in Marl, North Rhine-Westphalia, 2011. Warhawks of War released in 2011 on Killer Cobra Records to positive reviews with a faster, harder sound than previously seen in Thunderblood Heart. The band had multiple guest musicians join them for the album, including Robert Dahlqvist (\\"Str√§ngen\\") and Andreas Tyrone Svensson (\\"Dregen\\") from the Hellacopters. It was during this time that The Aviator retired from touring, and the band recruited a new bassist in the form of The Burgher. Warhawks of War was a hit, with the band touring Germany, Spain, and France in promoting it. The Burgher's debut recording was on the single \\"Metalhead\\", which released in June 2012. However, in 2013 the band was financially exhausted and had to start a pledge campaign to resume work on their 4th album. By then, Dregen was getting a solo-album off the ground and chose M√§rvel to tour Scandinavia with him in autumn of that year. =An Established Sound for a New Label (2014 - Present)= The outcome of 2013's campaign would see the release of The Hadal Zone Express in March 2014. The album was a success, heavily influenced by 70s/80s glam with some very fast tracks such as \\"Danish Rush\\" and \\"Black Money\\". Michael Stalling of Metal.de called the album \\"Fun from beginning to end... each track has its own character and lets the album rock on\\". \\"Danish Rush\\" got a music video directed by Johan B√•√•th (the Doits) and filmed by Peder Carlsson (Backyard Babies), which features many members of the Hellacopters and has a chiptune version of the track in the credits. The band continued generating new songs and co-produced The Hills Have Eyes minialbum with Fred Estby, incorporating folk aspects to their recordings from Estby's studio Gutterview Recorders. A reinterpretation of W.A.S.P.'s song \\"L.O.V.E Machine\\" on the album got a music video using wooden mannequin figures and won the Honolulu 2016 Film Awards for best music video. The band would travel to the United Kingdom for the first time to attend the 2016 Hard Rock Hell festival and subsequently picked up drummer Tony Thornensson, with the stage name of The Charlatan. M√§rvel at the Hard Rock Hell festival in 2016. In 2016 their label, Killer Cobra Records, would close and leave the band looking for someone new. In 2017 they signed with Swedish rock label The Sign Records, with which they're active to this day. The new label made it possible for a U.S. release of The Hills Have Eyes on CD and made some of their older material more accessible outside of Europe. Around this time, the band would move to a devoted studio called the Solskensfabriken, where they would be able to record and master their material. M√§rvel would release their seventh album, M√ÑRVEL at the Sunshine Factory, in October to positive reviews. Andy Thorley of Maximum Volume Music gave it an 8.5/10 and called it \\"A record that, given a couple of listens, will reveal its true majesty\\". In 2017 M√§rvel would participate at the Fishbait Festival on √Öland, doing a special performance with Robert \\"Humbucker\\" Pehrsson, Nicke Borg (Backyard Babies), and Sator members Chips Kiesbye and Kent Norberg. In March 2019 M√§rvel contributed to a collaborative album by including the track \\"The Devil Stole The Beat From The Lord\\" on Payin' Our Dues: A Tribute To The Hellacopters. The following month in April the band released Guilty Pleasures, their first cover album since Unleashed! in 2006. The album drew from many unique styles of music, with the band putting their own hard-rock twist on them. Songs such as the surf-rock \\"El Camino Real\\" by Lee Dresser and a 180 BPM version of pub-rock \\"Sultans of Swing\\" by Dire Straits.

The band takes much of its influence from hard rock, heavy metal, and flamboyant glam rock. Bands such as Thin Lizzy, T-Rex, W.A.S.P., M√∂tley Cr√ºe, and RATT can be picked out of M√§rvel's musical style, with swinging vocals and fast guitars. Other Scandinavian acts before them, such as the Hellacopters, Turbonegro, and Gluecifer are also frequently cited as influences on their performances. However, the most evident influence on the band are KISS. The King described their style as \\"High Energy Rock\\" in a 2013 interview with Motor.de. \\"It (High Energy Rock) is a very powerful form of communication and in Sweden it's forbidden to play it when you're older than 30.\\" When asked about particularly influential bands on their sound, he responded \\"We're music addicts and we mix everything we can together. We're not interested in what's popular or not. We're plain and simple: In-your-face Rock n' Roll Evangelists!\\" Outside of their performances, M√§rvel don't live the lifestyles present in some of their lyrics.

Biography Matthews was born Mabel Lucy Hanlon in Wakefield on 25 May 1879. Matthews grew up in Yorkshire and Cheshire. Her father was a Chelsea Pensioner and she was his second daughter. His position meant he later worked as the gatekeeper for various government departments in Whitehall. She married Richard Matthews in 1901 and they lived in Barrow-in-Furness where he worked as a company secretary. He died in 1909 and Matthews moved to live mostly with her parents and sister, living in Burlington House Piccadilly. She took clerical work and began working for a paper makers‚Äô engineering company. Little Giant Electric drills from the Consolidated Pneumatic Tool Co Ltd in 1929  Consolidated Pneumatic Tool Co Ltd  By 1923 Matthews was in charge of the Electrical department of the Consolidated Pneumatic Tool Co Ltd. The company factory was in Scotland but their head office was in The Egyptian Building in Piccadilly. Matthews went on to become the manager of the company. She was not known to have any formal engineering qualifications. But by 1923 she had enough technical experience to get graduate membership of the Institute of Electrical Engineers. She became an Associate in 1930. She gave the company presentations and talks on the specialist equipment on coalmining drills and welding. Matthews was a very early member of the Women's Engineering Society, (founded in 1919) giving talks to the membership as early as 1922.  Electrical Association for Women  Matthews suggested a scheme to popularise the domestic use of electricity in 1924. She talked about getting the idea because of a conversation about hard work while working on a farm during the war. Most people didn't know how to use the electric appliances that were only newly being brought to all parts of the UK. Matthews presented the idea to the Institute of Electrical Engineers in her associate requirement paper, but they turned the proposal down, as did the Electrical Development Association, (formed in 1919) stating that they felt the time was not ripe for such an organisation. Matthews next approached Caroline Haslett, Secretary of the Women's Engineering Society (WES). Haslett's reaction was very enthusiastic and she took it to the then President of WES, Lady Katharine Parsons, who was less enthusiastic but was persuaded to give the idea her support. A meeting was set up for the 12th November 1924, at the London home of Lady Parsons, with attendees made up of leading figures in the world of engineering and women‚Äôs organisations, including Sir Charles Parsons, Lord Headley, Sir Alfred Yarrow, Mr. F. S. Button, Mr J Beauchamp (Director of EDA), Mr B. Llewelyn Atkinson (Cable Makers Association), Margaret Partridge (WES member, electrical engineer and company director), Miss T J Dillon and Miss Hilda Shaw from the world of domestic science, Miss B J Lanfear of the Incorporated Municipal Electrical Association, with representatives from the Girl Guides, the Women‚Äôs Co- operative Guild, the Gardens Cities and Town Planning Association, the Headmistresses‚Äô Association; the National Union of Women Teachers, the National Council of Women and the National Women Citizens‚Äô Association. Mrs Matthews read her paper to the meeting. > ‚ÄúWhen I was haymaking during the war, an old farm hand came to me and said, > ‚ÄúNow ma‚Äôam, this is a job where you can work hard or you can work light, > what you want is to work light‚Äù. I‚Äôve never forgotten that, and I look round > and see lots of women working hard when they might work ‚Äúlight‚Äù with equally > effective results. This is where electricity can help: and not only in > regard to work but in health, hygiene and greater comfort in the home.

It is by > this form of thrift that electricity in going to help women.‚Äù What was termed \\"a lively discussion\\" followed Matthew's speech and the meeting ended with a resolution, proposed by Margaret Partridge and agreed unanimously ‚Äú‚Ä¶to form a Women‚Äôs Electrical Association‚Äù and wishing ‚Äúto put on record its thanks to Mrs Matthews‚Äù. The Women‚Äôs Electrical Association was formally established in December 1924, with Haslett as its first Director. The name was soon changed to the Electrical Association for Women (EAW) in early 1925 to avoid confusion with the acronym of the Workers‚Äô Educational Association Matthews was also a vice president of the EAW, which finally closed up in 1986, once the objectives were met. Matthews retired about 1940, and was living in Herne Hill at the end of her life. She died on 2 February 1970 in Camberwell.

In 2018, his critically acclaimed debut album A Louder Silence was released on Night Time Stories, which was followed by a second album Angel In Disguise in June 2020.  Career  Since beginning his career with his debut album A Louder Silence in 2018, Leifur James garnered critical attention, occupying the space between experimentation and introspection. Support on the airwaves came from leading radio presenters Tom Ravenscroft, Mary Anne Hobbs and Gilles Peterson on BBC6 Music, Young Turks label show on NTS and Bradley Zero & Charlie Bones on Worldwide FM. Soon after the album a remix EP followed with cutting edge reworks from up and coming talent across the electronic music spectrum. This included remixes from Bruce, FaltyDL and Whities producer Coby Sey, leading to praised reviews from music publications Resident Advisor, Pitchfork, Mixmag, Electronic Sound, Future Music UK. In February 2020, James announced his follow up album Angel of Disguise on Late Night Stories. Leading up the release of Angel In Disguise, British electronic music magazine DJ Mag premiered the album's fourth single Ritual describing the track as feeling \\"indebted to Burial‚Äôs nightbus-tailored garage, while wavering synth cries and cinematic pianos\\". A very well received album earned the place as 'Album Of The Month' by Future Music for a \\"magnificent record\\" by \\"a singular artist who revels in playing with boundaries\\" and a review from Crack Magazine stating that \\"Angel In Disguise certainly demonstrates James' skill as a producer\\". Upon the album's full release, Vinyl Factory dubbed it as \\"melancholic electronica\\", solidifying James' sonic development from the more upbeat A Louder Silence. Although key to his creative process, visual media took centre stage in a collaboration with Hungarian director, Bal√°zs Simon. Premiered on Boiler Room's '4:3' platform, known for showcasing the best in new moving visual media, Wurlitzer was then nominated for a UK Music Video Award. The masterful blend of James' harmonic vocals and Simon's powerful visuals earned the duo widespread support from CLASH Magazine, Director's Notes, Motionographer, the London Short Film Festival and the UK and Berlin Music Video Awards. Further showcasing his visual ability, James shared a series of photographs with Mixmag to accompany his 'Club Epiphany Tracks' from around the early years of the previous decade (2010s). In an intimate interview with √ÇUGHT Magazine leading up to the release of Angel In Disguise, James discusses his musical influences and the importance of his experiences of free thinking while in education and turning an unfortunate event into a blessing. As a live performer, James has taken his fusion of Jazz and experimental soundscapes to festivals including Bluedot, The Great Escape, We Out Here, Sundaze and Nova Batida. James supported German composer Pantha du Prince at a sold-out concert in the main Barbican Hall before selling out a string of his own live shows across Europe including the Southbank Centre in London - a highlight of his career so far. He was set to tour his new live electronic show for the release of Angel In Disguise in May 2020, via a string of intimate shows across the U.K. and further afield in mainland Europe, beginning in Copenhagen before heading to Berlin and then finishing in London. His touring schedule has been postponed and is set to resume Autumn 2020.

The type and only known species is Kompsornis longicaudus; the specific name means \\"long-tailed\\". It is known from only a single fossil specimen from the Jiufotang Formation. Kompsornis was closely related to the well-known Jeholornis, another long-tailed avialan from China, but differs from it in features of its skeleton, particularly the fusion and growth rate of its bones. Like other jeholornithiforms, Kompsornis was a long-tailed avialan with long wings and possessed little or no teeth, with none identified in the single specimen of Kompsornis. Classification Kompsornis was described and named by Wang and colleagues in 2020 from the sole specimen AGB-6997, an articulated complete skeleton preserved on a single slab, and was recognised as a jeholornithiform avialan. Their description included a comprehensive comparison between Kompsornis and the type specimens of other named jeholornithiform species, including all species of Jeholornis, Shenzhouraptor sinensis, Dalianraptor cuhe and the possible euavialan Jixiangornis orientalis. They concluded that Kompsornis was a distinct species from all other jeholornithiform species, and that they all represented valid species except for Dalianraptor, which was determined to be an artificial forgery of different specimens and lacking any diagnostic characteristics. A phylogenetic analysis supported this conclusion, which recovered Kompsornis as a jeholornithiform most closely related to Jeholornis prima and J. curvipes (Jeholornis 'sensu stricto'), and more derived than Shenzhouraptor, J. palmapenis and Jixiangornis: Kompsornis is distinguished from other jeholornithiform species by traits such as a more posteriorly directed pubis, especially elongated caudal vertebrae in the tail, extreme tail length, longer forelimbs, and features of the sternum and coracoid in the shoulder. The hip and sternum are also more extensively fused than in other jeholornithiforms, despite its immaturity, and the skeleton overall has more bird-like growth patterns than in other sampled jeholornithiforms. Palaeobiology The growth rate of Kompsornis was sampled from a cross-section of a rib bone and compared to those of Jeholornis sp. The specimen was determined to be at least four years old and approaching maturity, but was not yet fully grown. Kompsornis possessed a different growth strategy to Jeholornis, particularly in the fusion of the sternum and hips prior to skeletal maturity, which often remain unfused even in larger and older specimens of Jeholornis. Such differences in growth patterns may be evidence that jeholornithiforms evolved distinct growth strategies to adopt different ecologies in the same environment.

After being delayed multiple times, \\"XCX World\\" was eventually shelved, and leaked. Despite being given a name, tracklist, and cover art, Charli XCX has confirmed that her fans made all of these decisions, and in reality there was never a finished work, despite her saying on multiple occasions that the album was finished in 2016 & 17 \\"XCX World\\" was originally going to be released in September 2017 by the name of \\"XCX World\\", however due to leaks and Charli's record label, it has been permanently scrapped.  Background and cancellation  In July 2015, Charli XCX interviewed that she was working on her third album and described it as \\"the most pop thing, and the most electronic thing\\" she has ever done. Scottish producer SOPHIE, along with BloodPop and StarGate, were confirmed to be involved in the album's production. She worked with other pop hitmakers such as MNDR, The Invisible Men and MNEK during the album's sessions as well. In October 2015, Charli XCX premiered a new song called \\"Vroom Vroom\\" on the Beats 1 Radio Show as a \\"preview\\" to see what's she's been working on in the studio. she set up a new label called Vroom Vroom Recordings, and she would later release an EP titled , Vroom Vroom under this label. The songs from the EP were all recorded with intention of being included on the album. In July 2016, it was announced that British producer A.G. Cook, founder of record label PC Music, had signed on as Charli's creative director. On 28 October 2016, the then lead single, \\"After the Afterparty\\", was released.

On 8 February 2017, she performed it on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, along with titled \\"Bounce\\", featuring Japanese hitmaker Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. She said in an interview that month that her album was finished and to be released in September.

On 20 August 2017, multiple songs from the album was leaked onto the internet after being scammed from a hacker who was mastering the album. This led to the album being cancelled and Charli deciding to remake an entirely new third studio album which resulted in the album \\"Charli\\", after releasing two mixtapes called \\"Number 1 Angel\\" (which would include several songs recorded for the scrapped album) and \\"Pop 2\\". In September 2019, Charli revealed in an interview with FADER stated that she never officially gave the album a title as XCX World was just a name fans had given to it and stated that the album \\"was never really a fully formed thing\\".

Emerging as a niche genre of artistic work following the development of blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in the mid to late 2010's, crypto art quickly grew in popularity in large part because of the unprecedented ability afforded by the underlying technology for purely digital artworks to be bought, sold, or collected by anyone in a decentralized manner.  Definition  While there isn't one agreed upon definition for the term, two common interpretations currently exist among crypto artists and their collectors. The first, regarding crypto-themed artworks, or those with subject matters focusing on the culture, politics, economics, or philosophy surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. The second, and more popularized definition, includes digital artwork that is published directly onto a blockchain in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT), which makes the ownership, transfer, and sale of an artwork possible in a cryptographically secure and verifiable manner. Although many involved in the crypto art market would consider both descriptions to be valid, confusion can often arise when attempting to formally define crypto art since gray areas and nuance make it somewhat difficult to do so. For example, blockchain technology has also been used to publicly register and authenticate preexisting physical artworks to differentiate them from forgeries and verify their ownership via physical trackers or labels, however, whether or not such artworks could be classified as crypto art is unclear.

The group consists of Robert Kodym on vocals and guitar, ≈†tƒõp√°n Smet√°ƒçek on drums, Tom√°≈° Varteck√Ω on guitar, and Radek Havl√≠ƒçek on bass. They began as a punk band but settled into a mainstream rock sound by the early 1990s. Kodym and former member P.B.CH. were also in the band Lucie, led by David Koller, which they had formed together in 1985. The duo formed the core of Wanastowi Vjecy until 2010, when P.B.CH. left. History Wanastowi Vjecy formed in 1988 as a studio project to record music for a forthcoming documentary about punk music in Prague. Their original lineup consisted of Kodym on guitar and vocals, Petr B≈ôetislav Chovanec (more commonly known as P.B.CH.) on bass and vocals, and Adolf Vit√°ƒçek on drums. They wrote four songs for the project, which were released on a 1990 punk compilation by various artists, titled Epidemie (Epidemic). Three of the tracks made it to their debut album Tak mi to teda nandey (Give It to Me Then), released in 1991. The album had a punk vibe to it but mainly tended towards a generic rock sound. Ivan Pol√°k recorded the drums on the record. The band's second album, L≈æi, sex & prachy (Lies, Sex & Money) was released in 1992, followed by Divnoalbum (Strange Album), a compilation of remixes, live recordings, and instrumental compositions, in 1993. Lucie had been on a brief hiatus since 1992, and as they reformed the following year, Wanastowi Vjecy was shelved in turn. The project returned in 1996 with the album Andƒõl√© (Angels), which had a rawer sound than their previous offerings. The following year saw the release of 333 st≈ô√≠brnejch st≈ô√≠kaƒçek (333 Silver Sprinklers - a common Czech tongue twister). The band toured with the album, then did an acoustic Christmas set, and again paused activities to focus on the efforts of their sister group Lucie. Wanastowi Vjecy released their next album, Hraƒçky (Toys), in April 2000, but it proved less successful than their earlier work. Due to their commitment to Lucie, the band did not do a tour for the album. In September 2001, they issued the compilation Ty nejlep≈°√≠ vƒõci (The Best Things) on the tenth anniversary of the release of their debut album. Guitarist Tom√°≈° Varteck√Ω at this time also played with Daniel Landa and David Koller's Kollerband. In the spring of 2003, Lucie keyboardist Michal Dvo≈ô√°k was fired and replaced by Tom√°≈° Varteck√Ω. David Koller left Lucie in 2005. Kodym, P.B.CH., and drummer Martin Vajgl (-123 min) began preparing a new album. It saw the light of day in the fall of 2006 under the title Torp√©do. In the spring of 2007, an extensive concert tour was to take place, but due to problems with logistics and a change of management, only one show was held in London. The same year, the 2-CD + DVD compilation Best of 20 let (Best of 20 Years) was released. In 2018, the band performed at Prague's Sazka Arena in celebration of their 20-year anniversary, and this was followed by a concert tour. The band then went on a 2-year hiatus, and in 2010 announced the departure of founding member P.B.CH. The musician stated that he wanted to devote himself to his own projects as well as the creation of film music. The same year, Kodym revealed that drummer ≈†tƒõp√°n Smet√°ƒçek and bassist Radek Havl√≠ƒçek had joined the band. Both musicians had been active in the band during the first half of the 90s. In this new lineup, two concerts took place in 2011. In the autumn of 2011, the first album without P.B.CH. was released under the title Let√≠me na Wenu≈°i (Let's Fly to Venus). In April 2012, the group embarked on a tour that included, in addition to Czech cities, two stops in Slovakia. In 2016, Wanastowi Vjecy released their eighth studio album, titled Alchymie (Alchemy). In 2018, Lucie officially reformed in its best- known formation of Kodym, P.B.CH., Koller, and Dvo≈ô√°k after a 16-year hiatus, and released the album EvoLucie.

She is the Head of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Division at the University of Washington School of Medicine (UWSOM). Education Wald attended Wesleyan University for her Bachelor of Arts degree, where she was encouraged by a professor to apply to medical school. Wald agreed and graduated from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai with her MD degree in 1985. During her doctoral residency, she worked in inner-city hospitals and AID clinics. She moved to Seattle in 1989 and was hired by doctors Ann Collier and Lawrence Corey to work in the AIDS Clinical Trials Unit at the University of Washington School of Medicine (UWSOM). Career Wald joined the faculty in the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at UWSOM with a joint appointment in Epidemiology in 1995. While serving as the director of the UWSOM's Virology Research Clinic, she conducted studies on the epidemic of genital herpes. One of the studies she led was focused on how health care professionals can assist those with herpes by focusing on how people feel and the stigma surrounding the disease. In 2000, she received the Philip and Helen Fialkow Scholars Award given to junior faculty who made \\"outstanding achievements in medicine, research, teaching, clinical work, and academic citizenship.\\" At the turn of the 21st century, Wald continued to lead studies on genital herpes, one of which found that condom use would prevent HSV infection. In order to reach this conclusion, Wald and colleagues studied more than 500 couples who had previously found the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) vaccine did not work. Together, they found that the people who used condoms more than half the time were less likely to become infected with HSV-2. In 2003, Wald co-led a study with Corey and Zane Brown which confirmed that Caesarian sections during childbirth prevent transmission of HSV. She also co-authored a study with an international team of researchers who found that taking a single daily dose of valacyclovir could reduce the transmission of genital herpes to uninfected partners. Wald began writing for the NEJM Journal Watch Women's Health as an Associate Editor in 2005. As a result of her research, Wald received the UWSOM's 2006 Award for Excellence in Mentoring Women and Minorities. Wald was promoted to the ranks of Full Professor by 2007 and co-published a study titled Genital herpes with Rachna Gupta and Terri Warren through The Lancet. By 2013, Wald began leading clinical studies of GEN-003, an investigational, protein subunit vaccine that had the possibility to treatgenital herpes. She later concluded that pritelivir had the ability to offer treatment to patients suffering with genital herpes. As a result of her research, Wald was the recipient of the 2014 Award for Scientific Advancement given by the Association for Women in Science (AWIS) and the 2015 Achievement Award from the American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association (ASTDA). On October 27, 2017, Wald was appointed Head of UWSOM's Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, replacing Wes Van Voorhis. In this role, she co-received an $11 million grant for a co-led study titled Syphilis Vaccine to Protect Against Local and Disseminated Treponema pallidum Infection. She also received the 2019 Saul Horowitz, Jr. Memorial Award from her alma mater, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. During the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, Wald and Helen Y.

Biography In 1853, his family moved to New York City. Around 1860 he began studying to become a doctor, like his father but, in his spare time, taught himself to paint. When his father died, in 1861, he gave up medicine and, at the age of eighteen, declared his intention to become a painter. His mother, naturally displeased, gave him one year to prove that he could support himself that way. In response, he spent six months painting landscapes in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, after which he sent three paintings to the National Academy of Design. From 1864, he was a member of the American, Pre-Raphaelite-inspired, \\"Association for the Advancement of the Cause of Truth in Art.\\" In 1868, he was attracted to Florida for health reasons and became one of the first well-known American painters to work there, near St. Augustine. In spring 1870 he went to France, where he briefly studied with Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, but was dissatisfied with his methods.Biography @ AskArt Shortly after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, he moved to Italy, where he lived for the rest of his life. There, he focused on architectural scenes and floral studies. In 1877, English critic John Ruskin saw his work and suggested subjects for him to paint, some of which he commissioned. Newman was married in 1883 to Englishwoman Mary Watson Willis. Beginning in 1887 he began spending winters in Egypt, remaining there several months every year. He returned to Egypt nearly every winter for the rest of his life. Most of the works he created on those visits are watercolors of ancient structures, especially of the Temple of Philae, rather than the usual Orientalist scenes. In 1896-1897 he visited Japan, where he did a group of architectural and landscape views.

They inhabit forests and open grasslands, with flights near river gorges as well. Individuals are 16 millimetres in length. With the wingspan being 55 millimetres. Life History N. sinuata is primarily diurnal, the flight period lasts from mid-May to late June. They only emerge if conditions are above 17¬∞C with little to no wind. It primarily feeds on pollen. Studies have shown that N. sinuata primarily feeds on the pollen of Alyssum murale, Cota austriaca, and Achillea coarctata. Eggs are laid on the ground, females lay up to 70 eggs during the early morning. The eggs are dormant for 23-25 days until hatching. The larvae are unusual for other lacewings in that they are primarily herbivorous, rejecting other insect prey in favour of water and vegetable sap.

The motherland controversyÁ∞°ÂæåËÅ∞„ÄäÂè∞ÁÅ£Âè≤„Äã„ÄàÁ¨¨‰∏ÉÁ´† Êó•ÊìöÊôÇÊúü„Äâ ( or shortly, ) happened in 1936 in colonial Taiwan of Japan. Lin Hsien-tang, the chief of the family of Lin from Wufeng, Taiwan, was openly humiliated by a Japanese gangster in 1936 for he had once called China his motherland. The media propaganda afterwards forced Lin to quit all political positions and moved from Taiwan to Tokyo in order to avoid further controversy. This controversy is believed to be deliberately raised by Japanese military, who tried to warn Taiwanese intellectuals about their Chinese nationalism.  Background  In March 1936, Lin Hsien-tang along with his brother Lin Jietang, and his son Lin Youlong visited southern China, as led by newspaper Taiwan Xinminbao. They toured Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shantou, Hong Kong, Guangdong and Shanghai. When Lin Hsien-tang was at a welcome ceremony in Shanghai, he said, \\"We are finally back in our motherland ().\\" His speech was then sent to the head of Taiwan Army of Japan.  Conflict  On 17 June 1936, the Head of Taich≈´ Prefecture invited Lin to the ceremony in memory of Japanese rule of Taiwan at Taich≈´ Park. In the ceremony, a Japanese r≈çnin called Uruma Zenbee (Japanese: ), who was also a right-wing activist, stopped Lin and shouted loudly, \\"why did you say you were back in your motherland in the ceremony where chankoros (Japanese: , literally means the slaves of Qing) welcomed you?\\" The r≈çnin gave Lin a letter of admonishment, which demanded Lin to \\"1) resign as the legal consultant of the Governor and any other public positions, 2) openly apologize for mistakenly saying returning to motherland in Shanghai, 3) no longer participate in any political, cultural or societal events in the future.\\" Then the r≈çnin slapped Lin in public. Lin called the police. After the police sent this r≈çnin to the local prosecutor's, the court of Taihoku refused to open any lawsuit over the issue and released the r≈çnin.  Impact  Japanese governor-backed newspaper Taiwan Daily News kept reporting the event and attacking Lin. Ye Rongzhong, the secretary of Lin, believed that Rippei Ogisu, the military head of colonial Taiwan, was behind the insults. Due to the overwhelming media pressure, Lin was forced to resign from the legal consultancy of the Government of colonial Taiwan, the Home Rule Alliance of Taiwan, the Common Prosperity Association of East Asia and newspaper Taiwan Minbao and moved to Tokyo with all his family of 7.

He is the chief of the Philippine National Police's National Capital Region Police Office since 2019. Early life and education Sinas was born in Butuan. He spent most of his teenage years in Mindanao due to the assignments of his father, who is a military officer. At the encouragement of his father, he entered the Philippine Military Academy, and graduated from the institution in 1987 as part of the Hinirang class. Career Prior to serving as Central Visayas police chief, Sinas served in the Police Regional Office 12 (PRO-12) as Deputy Regional Director for Administration and in Camp Crame as secretary to the Directorial Staff under the Office of the Chief Directorial Staff and later, director of the PNP Crime Laboratory. He was promoted to Police Chief Superintendent in April 2017. =Central Visayas chief= Sinas was police chief of the Philippine National Police's Police Regional Office 7 (PRO-7), which had jurisdiction over Central Visayas, for one year and four months. He worked under the office from July 2018 to October 2019. During his term at this post, Negros Oriental, a province under his jurisdiction, was the subject of intense scrutiny due to the 2017‚Äì19 Negros Island killings which led to Sinas appearing at an August 2019 Senate hearing to explain the increased number of killings in the province. =Metro Manila chief= Sinas was reassigned to Metro Manila in October 2019. His appointment as chief of the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) was announced on October 10, 2019. and formally assumed the position on October 16, vowing to tackle illegal drugs, bribery, and gambling in Metro Manila. He succeeded Guillermo Eleazar, who was appointed as chief of the PNP Directorial Staff. By November 2019, 143 police officers from Central Visayas were reassigned to Metro Manila police office. One of the transferred personnel was assigned as the office's intelligence officer, though Sinas did not enact other leadership changes at the time. Sinas launched a biometrics system for the NCRPO on December 2, 2019 for accurate attendance monitoring of the police office's personnel.  Controversies and criticism  Birthday celebration amid COVID-19 pandemic = Sinas oversaw police response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Metro Manila, one of the most hardest hit regions of the pandemic. However, his stint as Metro Manila chief was marred by a controversy over an organization of a ma√±anita for his birthday on May 8 at Camp Bagong Diwa. A ma√±anita is a tradition in the police where senior officers are greeted by their personnel in the early morning of their birthdays. The holding of the occasion had negative reception from the public with the leadership of the Philippine National Police, filing charges against and eighteen other officers him for violation of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, particularly on provisions concerning social distancing and mass gathering at the time. Although Sinas keeps his post due to the \\"emergency situation\\" concerning the pandemic, the police agency is concerned that his programs related to COVID-19 response might be disrupted. Sinas has apologized for the event though he insisted that his office observed appropriate protocols. On May 20, President Rodrigo Duterte decided against dismissing Sinas or transferring him to another post, vouching for his character believing that he was not at fault for being \\"serenaded\\" during his birthday. = Harassment accusation = On July 18, 2020, Sinas and other armed NCRPO officials were accused of harassment by the Delos Santos family, with the incident being filmed by a CCTV camera and the footage going viral online. The NCRPO are allegedly attempting to evict the Delos Santos family from the property which will be used to build a quarantine facility for COVID-19 patients. Sinas explained that the property is owned by the PNP, and that the family's patriarch, Executive Master Sergeant Arnel Delos Santos, was allowed to live there temporarily with an agreement to vacate property after his retirement in November 2018.

Several daughters and one grand-daughter, Frances Alda, were first-rate singers. History The Simonsens' first Australian advertisement Fanny Simonsen 1890 Martin Simonsen c. 1889 Jules Simonsen c. 1890 Born Fran√ßoise De Haes or Dehaes, Fanny Simonsen was a French lyric soprano, who claimed aristocratic parentage and had studied under Manuel Garcia II. She had on occasion shared the Paris stage with Madame Carvalho, and played prima donna roles in Brussels and the great French provincial cities. She married the eminent Danish violinist Martin Simonsen, and for nine years restricted her appearances to the concert stage in Europe and California. The Simonsens arrived in Melbourne from Germany in August 1865 by the mail steamer Northam after a successful tour of China and India, and held a series of seven concerts at St George's Hall, Bourke Street, Melbourne, from Saturday 19 August 1865, with a different program every night. In June 1866 Mme Simonsen joined Lyster's Grand Opera Company as prima donna, commencing with Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. This was followed by Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots (as Marguerite de Valois), the Australian premi√®re of L'Africaine (alternately with Lucy Escott, playing Selika), perhaps her most celebrated role This article has a photograph.) and Roberto il diavolo, perhaps their most popular production (as Isabel/Isabelle). In 1867 she played the name part in Maritana (Wallace), Amina in La Sonnambula (Bellini) and Auber's comic operas The Crown Diamonds as Catarina and Masaniello as Elvira. Despite Lyster's alternation of loss- making grand opera productions with crowd-pleasing comic offerings, his attention to detail and the quality of his orchestra and ensemble and stars Simonsen and Lucy Escott, Henry Squires and Armes Beaumont, he was failing in a business sense due to the public demand for novelty. Accordingly, he announced his intention to withdraw from Melbourne, which compounded the problem. After the troupe's tour of country Victoria ‚Äî Ballarat Geelong and Bendigo ‚Äî and before they crossed over to Adelaide, the Simonsens made their own farewell tour and returned to San Francisco; Geraldine Warden was Lyster's new soprano. They returned to Melbourne by the Marpesia in July 1869 and held a short series of concerts at the Academy of Music (Princess's Theatre on Spring Street), and the goldfield towns, supported by Rebecca Nordt (soprano), Arthur R. Moule (tenor) and Harcourt Lee (bass and pianist). :In January 1868 Lyster brought to Melbourne (fresh from South America): Vitali, Devoti, Bertolini, and the magnificent basso profundo D'Antoni/De Antoni. prima donna is Signora Ida Vitali and her husband, baritone Guiseppe Bertolini; second prima donna, Marinette Colombo ; tenor, Signor Ugo De Voti; basso, Signor Pietro d'Antoni. :Lyster took a company to San Francisco in the Alexander Duthie in August 1868; it was a failure from the start: Antoni died on the voyage there; Kitts' voice failed, the weather was foul and fear of earthquake kept many away. Escott and Squires left Lyster's company while in America, as did Beaumont, and the rest returned via New Zealand.) Far from quitting the Melbourne musical scene, in 1869 Lyster formed a partnership with John Washington Smith, previously of Lenton & Smith, to establish, in January 1870, an Italian Opera Company with Lucia Baratti, Lucy Chambers, Mariano Neri (tenor), Enrico Dondi (basso). Simonsen and Beaumont were among their first recruits. Another prominent member of the company was Signor Leandro Coy, whose family contributed much to Melbourne's music scene. :In later years Lyster suffered from a chronic illness, and despite a trip to Europe for treatment died on 27 November 1880. Simonsen's first appearance for this season was as Lucia in Lucia di Lammermoor on 10 February 1870, followed by Un Ballo in Maschera, Maritana, Il Barbiere di Siviglia, Martha (as Lady Harriet) and others. In May 1871 the Simonsens had a farewell tour of the major towns of Victoria and South Australia, having announced their leaving the country. On 19 August 1871 the Simonsen troupe, consisting of Rebecca Nordt, her husband Arthur Moule (tenor), Edward Farley (baritone), Barry O'Neil (comic singer), Henry King (pianist) held a concert at the Lyceum Theatre prior to leaving for Europe. The programme included Offenbach's The Rose of Auvergne, or, Spoiling the Broth and the first act of Verdi's Il Trovatore. Their farewell tour included New Zealand, and dragged on to September 1872. The Simonsens returned to Melbourne aboard the Norfolk in January 1876 and staged a couple of concerts at the Town Hall which were very well received by the few who attended. They also performed at the Metropolitan Liedertafel, held that same week. They assembled an opera company of some 40 or 50 singers to tour Victoria and New Zealand; they had brought with them a full wardrobe and scores for a hundred operas, some new to the colonies. She appeared at Melbourne's new Opera House (on Bourke Street) for Lyster in February 1876, alternating with Ilma De Murska, who appeared in Lucia and Sonnambula while Simonsen had The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein and Maritana. In March the Simonsens' Royal English Opera Company, of around 40 performers left for a tour of New Zealand. In Dunedin they played The Hermit's Bell and Lecocq's La fille de Madame Angot, and were received well despite having no recognised names apart from Simonsen. At Christchurch they performed Martha and at Wellington Lucia di Lammermoor, Martha, La Sonnambula and Auber's Carlo Broschi. The highly successful tour concluded at Invercargill in November 1876. The pianist, C. B. Foster (1853‚Äì1894), was praised. The Simonsen Opera Company (or Royal English and Opera Bouffe Company) embarked on a tour of south-western Victoria and across the border to Mount Gambier and another extended tour of Tasmania. In May 1877, after a year of frustration in not being able to hire a hall in Melbourne, Martin Simonsen announced his taking over the lease of St George's Hall to establish it as an English Opera House. While noting the unsuitability of the hall for opera ‚Äî its lack of depth, so most of the audience were too close to the tiny stage, and insufficient volume for decent acoustics ‚Äî the first offerings, Balfe's opera Satanella, in which Minna Fischer made her Melbourne debut, and Flotow's Martha were well received. The first season concluded with The Hermit's Bell, Maritana, Girofl√©-Girofla, The Bohemian Girl and The Grand Duchess, with smaller audiences. For the 1878 season the Simonsens leased the Prince of Wales Opera House,a much more suitable venue, also on Bourke Street. Works included Die Fledermaus, The Hermit's Bell, Satanella, The Bohemian Girl, The Grand Duohess, Girofl√©-Girofla, Maritana and Der Freisch√ºtz. Camille Dubois and C. H. Taylor joined Amy Sherwin, Minna Fischer and the rest of the cast. This was Armes Beaumont's last appearance before leaving for Europe and Fanny Simonsen's second announcement of her retirement. Simonsen's daughters Leonora and Martina made their stage debut at the Mechanics' Institute, Ballarat, in December 1879. In September 1880 Martina joined her mother's Royal English & Italian Opera Company of some 50 members, which included Martin Simonsen as conductor, Carrie Godfrey, Eugenie Dehaes, tenors Pietro Paladini and Gaetano Bianchi, and basses Ernest St Clair and Tom Riccardi. \\"Frances Saville\\", whose status as Simonsen's third daughter was not revealed, joined the company in 1882 for a 10-week season at the Gaiety Theatre, Sydney in 1882, when one critic commented on the daughters' German accent. They played at the Theatre Royal, Adelaide, in August and September to good and appreciative houses for ten different works, Un Ballo perhaps making the greatest impression. A feature was the company's first staging of Von Supp√©'s Boccaccia, translated from the German by Dexter Smith. The newly-reopened Theatre Royal, Hobart, followed in October, and again Boccaccio was a \\"hit\\". Fanny Simonsen finally quit the stage on 22 September 1884, but continued to give singing lessons at her home in St Kilda. Martin Simonsen continued concert management, bringing out the New Royal Italian Opera Company in 1886, whose stars included the bassos Tomaso De Alba and Attilio Buzzi and baritones Warwick Gainor and Achille Rebottaro and his sister Alice Rebottaro. In 1888 he brought out a troupe known as the \\"Spanish Students and Spanish Dancers\\", whose premiere on 8 September 1888 was described by a newspaper critic as a failure: the large and expectant audience was treated to a concert of mostly unfamiliar tunes and songs in a language which, though performed superbly, was unintelligible to most. The dancers were described as heavy-hoofed and immodestly dressed, an affront to the audience's sense of decency. The critique concluded with \\"Indeed, most of them appeared to be glad when it was over.\\" Around the same time Martin Simonsen had in Sydney an Italian troupe starring Lilian Tree and Giuseppe Pimazzoni, which had to be disbanded due to personal difficulties. His losses were substantial, and in February 1889 he filed for insolvency, his chief debtor being his wife. In 1891 husband and wife imported the Italian Opera Company, which opened with Il Trovatore at the Alexandra Theatre on 8 August. This was poorly attended and the tour cancelled; another financial blow. Inclement weather and the depressed economic climate were blamed, but a more likely cause was the opera's refined artistry and lack of well-known stars, as more prosaic entertainments nearby were doing well. Henry Bracy, in conjunction with Johnny Solomon, took over many of the Simonsen artists to form his own company. Last Years The Simonsens brought several Italian opera troupes to Australia which lost them a great deal of money. They also lost money on their Spanish Students scheme. Mme Simonsen brought in a little money as a singing tutor at their Carlisle Street, St Kilda, home. She died aged 61, as the result of an apoplectic fit shortly before midnight on 19 September 1896. She had a similar seizure some eleven years earlier but otherwise had enjoyed good health. In her last moments she requested that the score of Faust should be buried with her, which was carried out at the St Kilda Cemetery on 20 September 1896. After Mme Simonsen's death Mr Simonsen lived as a boarder with a Mrs Goulding (another source says Mr. and Mrs. Dunning) at 588 Elizabeth Street, Melbourne. Three years later, nearly deaf and blind and suffering from rheumatism, he died in his upstairs room of a self-inflicted pistol shot. Students A list of Fanny Simonsen's pupils includes Ada Crossley, Lillie Crowle, Ada Prull, Flora Graupner, Julia Simmons, Muriel Walsh, Jeanne Ramsay, Emilie Lambert and her own children Frances Saville, Martina Simonsen and Jules Simonsen, and presumably her granddaughter Frances Alda, whom she brought up from the age of five. Crossley was arguably her most important pupil ‚Äî she would travel from her country home to St Kilda twice weekly for lessons, until Simonsen agreed to take her as a boarder, a situation which lasted two or three years. Crossley recognised the benefit she gained by living in the musical home after Madame Simonsen's death by contributing ¬£50 towards her headstone. Martin Simonsen compositions Martin Simonsen composed for solo violin: *Victoria Galop *Melbourne Polka *Remembrances of Germany Oberland or Souvenir d'Allemagne *Life on the Ocean\\" fantasia on English and Irish airs Family Martin Simonsen (30 January 1830 ‚Äì November 1899) married Fran√ßoise Geanine \\"Fanny\\" De Haes (c. 1835 ‚Äì 19 September 1896). Their eleven children, of whom two, perhaps three, were born before arriving in Australia, included: *Eldest daughter Leonora Martina \\"Leo\\" Simonsen (1859 ‚Äì 27 December 1884) was born in Monte Video. Of undoubted musical ability, she made her operatic debut with that of her sister Martine at the Melbourne Town Hall on 10 July 1880, and toured America with her father. She was a rising prima donna on 18 October 1876 when she married David Davis (born c. 1852) at the synagogue, Christchurch, New Zealand. She returned to Australia in July 1879, followed a month later by her husband. A year later she divorced him on the grounds of cruelty and adultery (he was suffering from \\"a certain illness\\", presumably syphilis). They had two children: :*A child, name and gender not yet found, was born on 8 September 1877. :*Frances Jane \\"Fanny\\" Davis (31 May 1879 ‚Äì 18 September 1952) was born in New Zealand, renamed Frances \\"Francie\\" Adler after her mother's remarriage, and grew up with grandmother Simonsen after her mother's death. She sang with the \\"Gay Parisienne\\" Company, then by 1903 had, at the instigation of Madame Marchesi, adopted Frances Alda as her stage name, and 1883 as her year of birth. A famous racehorse, F.J.A., was named for her. She sang at \\"The Met\\" 1908‚Äì9, married Giulio Gatti-Casazza, divorced 1941, became a US citizen, married mining/advertising executive Ray VirDen (3 December 1895, Wheeler, Indiana ‚Äì 27 November 1955) on 14 April 1941. :In 1883 she left with her children for San Francisco where on 3 January 1884 she married again, to Herman Adler.

In 1891 she left for Paris for coaching (unnecessarily in the opinion of at least one critic) by Melba's tutor, Mathilde Marchesi. She was for a time the prima donna of the Grand Opera House, Brussels, and also gained recognition in London, Paris, Vienna, St Petersburg, and New York. She retired in California and never returned to Australia. *Jules Simonsen (2 April 1867 ‚Äì ) was a tenor vocalist on the Rickards circuit, then left for San Francisco, where he had a \\"chequered career\\". *Hermann Martin Simonsen (2 March 1869 ‚Äì c.

The Graham realizes this vision through making project-based grants to individuals and organizations and producing exhibitions, events, and publications.‚Äù It is located in the Madlener House in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. As of 2018, the Graham Foundation has awarded over 4,400 grants. Grants The Graham foundation provides two types of grants to individuals: Production and Presentation Grants and Research and Development Grants. Grantees are chosen based on four criteria: originality, potential for impact, feasibility, and capacity. Part of the Graham Foundation's mission includes supporting the developing careers of grantees and enabling projects that would not otherwise be possible. The Graham Foundation's 11-member Board of Trustees selects the cohort of grantees each year. Current and former board members include John Ronan and Theaster Gates. Grantee projects range from interactive exhibitions and workshops to books and documentary films. Past projects include a photographic survey of Le Corbusier‚Äôs completed works and an online oral history of housing construction for homeless individuals living with HIV/AIDS in New York City. The Graham Foundation has supported the publication of several field-defining architecture books, Robert Venturi's Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture and Rem Koolhaas's Delirious New York among them. In July 2020, The Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts reported a total of 52 awards worth $320,800. Grants will fund important projects tackling and shaping the future of architecture and the developed environment. Public Programming The Graham Foundation aims to foster dialogue and expand the audience around architecture and its impacts on society and culture. To that end, the organization hosts galleries, an outdoor collection of architectural fragments, an archive of grantee publications, and a ballroom for lectures and events open to the public. Notable architects including Rem Koolhaas, Denise Scott Brown, Robert Venturi, Buckminster Fuller, and Louis Kahn have lectured and held exhibitions there. The Graham Foundation Bookshop, also located in the Madlener house, houses grant-funded titles, international periodicals, and rare publications on architecture, urbanism, and related fields.
