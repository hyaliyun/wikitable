This relates to the interaction of sound with thermal waves in crystals (phonons), with light (photons), with electrons in metals and semiconductors (acousto-electric phenomena), with magnetic excitations in ferromagnetic crystals (magnons), etc. Some recently developed experimental techniques include photo-acoustics, acoustic microscopy and acoustic emission. A long-standing interest is in acoustic and ultrasonic wave propagation and scattering in inhomogeneous materials, including composite materials and biological tissues. There are two main classes of problems studied in physical acoustics. The first one concerns understanding how the physical properties of a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) influence the propagation of acoustic waves in this medium in order to use this knowledge for practical purposes. The second important class of problems studied in physical acoustics is to obtain the relevant information about a medium under consideration by measuring the properties of acoustic waves propagating through this medium.

Spirits then rose from the northwest corner of the stadium in response to the President's invitation. Each of them representing the Olympic colors of Red (Americas), Green (Oceania), Black (Africa), Yellow (Asia), and Blue (Europe) rose to the beat of their own percussion. They summoned tribes out to the stadium floor with their own color and the percussion began to mix. Meanwhile, US Army Paratroopers rappelled down from the stadium roof trailing long colorful papers representing the colors while the tribes formed the Rings of the Olympic flag and the Children of Atlanta, dressed in white, formed the number 100 representing the Centennial of the Olympic Games. Then the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of famed film composer John Williams, played Summon the Heroes which was the official song of the 1996 Olympics. (This was actually his second piece of music for the Olympics with the first being Olympic Fanfare and Theme from the 1984 games.) As the song started, the children formed a flying dove which is a symbol of the Olympic movement as doves symbolize peace. As the music continued, the five tribes intermingled until there was a huge mixture of humanity at the center of the stadium with the tribes all mingled together as one to symbolize the gathering of nations at the Olympics. =The National Anthem= Following the Call to the Nations, the first official protocol of the ceremony took place. This called for the head of state to make his or her entrance. In this case the head of state was Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States. He was joined by Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games President Billy Payne and IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch. After the presentation of colors, the American flag was raised while the Centennial Olympic choir sung the national anthem which was The Star-Spangled Banner. A fly-by from the USAF Thunderbirds concluded the segment. =Welcome to the World= The Artistic portion of the ceremony began and first up was a rousing number called \\"Welcome to the World.\\" This was an over the top number featuring cheerleaders, marching bands, and steppers. They performed a montage of southern culture in the deep south including the college sporting culture as well as performing an all- American party. The audience also participated as they performed the wave. Assisting the cast were chromed Chevrolet pick-up trucks with spotlights in the beds. The segment ends with a fireworks display. =Georgia on My Mind= Gladys Knight sang \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", Georgia's official state song, at the opening ceremony. =Summertime= This was the longest artistic segment of the ceremony. Entitled \\"Summertime: The Beauty of the South,\\" the focus was on Atlanta and the Old South with a placement on its beauty, spirit, music, history, culture, and rebirth after the American Civil War. During the segment, James Earl Jones quotes famous American writers Zora Neale Hurston, William Faulkner, Mark Twain, and Thomas Rorke. The segment began with two people each dressed in large butterfly type wingspans. One butterfly as the Moon and the other as the Sun on opposite ends of the stadium. They meet in the center and create the \\"American Southern Spirit\\" The American Southern Spirit is a female operatic singer dressed all in white with large butterfly wingspans. The southern spirit butterfly along with other performers dressed as butterflies and fireflies dance to southern music. They welcome the spring with Jazz and Gospel music. Songs include Ol' Man River, Skip to My Lou and When the Saints Go Marching In. This was meant to represent the American south during the antebellum period of American history. During the celebration a large mechanical thunderbird appears from the north end of the stadium and engulfs all the butterflies and fireflies on the stadium floor with a large grey cover. The large creature represents the American civil war and the damage caused to the city, the American south and the nation as a whole. The performers and the southern spirit butterfly are left ravaged, in shock and saddened. The southern spirit butterfly is devastated but she slowly brings the other butterflies and creatures back to life with her operatic voice. She re-awakens the creatures. Fifty southern spirit dressed butterflies re-appear and are all dressed with a multi colored wingspan. They represent a new and reborn south. The entire stadium is relit with colored flash lights provided to the audience and the music begins to play Alleluyah, Glory, Glory (Lay My Burden Down) in gospel music and a reprisal of When the Saints Go Marching In. The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Atlanta Centennial Choir (Morehouse College Glee Club, Spelman College Glee Club) performed all the music.https://olympicceremonies.wordpress.com/1996-Atlanta-opening-ceremony- music-list/ The segment ends with a large fireworks display. =Temple of Zeus= The stadium is then darkened and a temple is produced at the center of the stadium. This represents the ancient Greek Olympics. This is a large temple dedicated to Zeus and featured eight pillars weighing 2,500 pounds each and arranged in an octagonal shape at the center of the stadium. A procession of Greek athletes and Greek priestesses walk towards the pillars and simulate preparation for athletic competition. Each manually adjustable cable of the eight pillars simultaneously hoists up an upper-perimeter of the large screen until the screen forms its upright 360¬∞ octagonal shape. Once hoisted, each of eight to sixteen actors/dancers located between the interior of the screen and a central 20,000 watt arc light casts a body-shadow or silhouette portraying an athlete or goddess, at times reaching nearly 50 feet in height. They strike the poses of the classic events of the ancient Olympics: archery, the discus, wrestling and running. The goddess of victory then appears to honor the champions.\\"Secrets of the Olympic Ceremonies (eBook) pgs. 91-93\\"1996 Atlanta Olympic Opening Ceremony WXIA Part 3 of 8\\" YouTube.com The music used during this segment was called \\"The Tradition of the Games\\" composed by Basil Poledouris. The segment ends with everything going dark signifying the end of the ancient Olympics. Behind the scenes, workers remove the tarp from the track. =Parade of Nations= Spain at the opening ceremony A tribute to Barron Pierre commences, his voice surrounds the stadium proclaiming the rebirth of the modern Olympics. Then there is a reprisal of the Call of the Nations. Once again the five Olympic spirits rise, this time calling for the rebirth of the modern games. Then the stadium lights up and reveals the track and a stage where the temple was standing. One by one, runners representing the previous Olympics starting with Athens and continuing to Barcelona appear and run around the track. Following Barcelona is the Atlanta flag-barer. She is a woman and overtakes her fellow Olympics. She runs up a ramp in the northwest portion of the stadium and waves in celebrating before disappearing into the night. After a brief moment, the Greek delegation emerges marking the start of the Parade of Nations. Then 195 nations march in alphabetical order according to the English language. Nation 197, by tradition, is the host nation, and the United States enters last. Though not all athletes appeared at the opening ceremony, over 10,000 athletes were scheduled to partake in the competition. =Olympic Speeches, the Olympic Flag, and the symbolic release of Doves= Following the parade, ACOG President Billy Payne and IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch deliver opening remarks welcoming everybody to the Games. Then U.S. President Bill Clinton opens the games by saying, \\"I declare open the Games of Atlanta, celebrating the XXVI Olympiad of the modern era.\\" Then the Olympic flag made its entrance. It was carried by 8 American Olympians from the past while the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra performed the tune \\"Simple Gifts.\\" Then the Olympic flag was raised while the Olympic Hymn was played by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and sung by the Centennial Olympic Choir. Following the flag raising, 100 kids ran paper-maiche doves around the stadium symbolizing the peaceful gathering of athletes from across the world. This was followed by a playing of portions of Martin Luther King Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech which he delivered in 1963 with a gospel choir. Finally Olympic heroes from the past were honored including Leon ≈†tukelj who was then the oldest living gold medalist having earned his first gold in the 1924 Paris Olympics. =The Olympic Flame and Oaths= Al Oerter carried the torch to the stadium and was the last to hold the torch outside of the stadium. He passed the torch to Evander Holyfield who ran it through a network of tunnels and then made his appearance inside of the stadium to a thunderous ovation on the stage in the middle of the field. Beethoven Ninth Symphony (Ode to Joy) was played in the background. Holyfield ran the torch down to the track and was joined by Greek athlete Voula Patoulidou. They both held the flame and made a lap around the track. This symbolized the relationship between the first and current Olympic games. The pair then passed the flame to American swimmer Janet Evans, the penultimate torchbearer, carried it around a lap of the track and up a long ramp leading towards the northern end of the stadium. After more than 10,000 torch bearers, Muhammad Ali, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, dramatically lit the Olympic cauldron. Then the oaths were given. US Basketball athlete Teresa Edwards gave the Athletes Oath on behalf of all athletes. Then diving official Hobie Billingsley delivered the officials oath. =The Power of the Dream= Music rounded out the ceremony. First up was the song \\"The Power of the Dream\\". It was composed by David Foster and performed in the opening ceremony by C√©line Dion accompanied by David Foster on the piano, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Centennial Choir (Morehouse College Glee Club, Spelman College Glee Club and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus).Erie Times-News, \\"Erie Company's Olympic Work Shines\\", June 10, 1996, by Greg LavinePlating and Surface Finishing Magazine, August 1996 Issue The song was so moving that it became the unofficial anthem of the Atlanta games. At the Closing Ceremony, the children of Atlanta performed the song as their farewell to the world. To close out the ceremony, Jessye Norman performed the song \\"Faster, Higher, Stronger.\\" References Opening Ceremony, 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympics opening ceremonies Category:Ceremonies in the United States ","title":"1996 Summer Olympics opening ceremony"},{"id":"36635288","text":"is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Taishi Mori.

The Jew is a comedy written by playwright Richard Cumberland and first presented at the Drury Lane Theatre in London in May 1794. The play is notable as the first play in the English theatre to portray a Jewish moneylender as the hero of a stage production. An adaptation of the original play along with a facsimile copy of The Jew was published in 2012 as Sheva, the Benevolent. The anti-Jewish tradition on the English stage dates back at least to the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290 and is exemplified by the characters of Shylock in William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice and Barabas in Christopher Marlowe's The Jew of Malta. In a series of articles called Observer, first published in 1785, Cumberland created a character named Abraham Abrahams who would later serve as a template for Sheva, the title character in The Jew. In one instalment of Observer, Abrahams is quoted as saying, \\"I verily believe the odious character of Shylock has brought little less persecution upon us, poor scattered sons of Abraham, than the Inquisition itself.\\" A decade later, in writing The Jew, Cumberland sought to create a positive image of a Jewish man that would counteract centuries of anti-Semitic portraits. The tremendous success of the initial production prompted Cumberland to later write, \\"The benevolence of the audience assisted me in rescuing a forlorn and persecuted character, which till then had only been brought upon the stage for the unmanly purpose of being made a spectacle of contempt, and a butt for ridicule. In the success of this comedy I felt of course a greater gratification, than I had ever felt upon a like occasion.\\" Shortly after its London premiere, the play began to be performed in the United States, first in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York City and, later, in Richmond, Charleston, and many other cities and towns. The play was also translated into numerous languages including German, French, Hebrew, Yiddish, and Russian. The last known New York production under its original title was presented at the Bronx Free Synagogue in 1919. Plot Charles, a young clerk employed in the counting house of the merchant Sir Stephen Bertram is fired because his sister Eliza is romantically involved with Sir Stephen's son, Frederick (who is also Charles's best friend). Unknown to both Sir Stephen and Charles, Frederick and Eliza have already been secretly married. To help his now unemployed friend financially, Frederick seeks to borrow money from a Jewish moneylender named Sheva, whom Frederick assumes is a merciless and stingy miser. Sheva is actually a very kind man and a sympathetic listener. When he realises that Charles is the son of \\"Don Carlos,\\" a soldier who once rescued him from an angry mob in Cadiz, Spain, he decides to give Frederick the money to help his friend, and secretly invests money in Eliza's name to demonstrate to Sir Stephen that Eliza is a worthy wife for his son. Charles, however, is stubbornly proud and, when he learns that Frederick has secretly married his sister, he challenges his friend to a duel. Their sword fight ends quickly when Charles receives a minor cut on his wrist and, after the truth about Sheva's generous gift is revealed, everything ends happily.

History The original castle was built in the early Middle Ages by the Agilolfings. This was acquired by the Wittelsbach dukes in 1247. When Count Palatine Otto Henry began his rule in Palatinate-Neuburg in 1522, he found a medieval fortified castle in his residence city of Neuburg, which, unlike similar princely residences was still not adjusted for the demands of a modern court. So from 1527 he ordered to re- design the castle into a Renaissance palace and to expand the artistic quality and condition to one of the most important palaces of the first half of the 16th Century in Germany. From 1537 an additional west wing was added which also includes the chapel. The chapel is the oldest newly built protestant church in the world, although construction of the shell began as a catholic court chapel in 1537, with a small apse, in which the altar with a crucification group, commissioned in 1540, is placed. In 1541 elector Otto Henry converted to the new Lutheran protestantism, and from 1542 the Salzburg church painter Hans Bocksberger der √Ñltere lavishly decorated the chapel with painted ceiling vaults and galleries in the latest antique-style Italian manner. The picture program not only thematized the decisive role of Christ as divine guarantor of grace, the central lutheran doctrine. It also claims a decisive role of the prince in the distribution of this grace within a God- given earthly order. The court chapel was consecrated on 25 April 1543 by the reformed theologian Andreas Osiander. It was thus the first newly built protestant church, an honor often attributed to the court chapel of Hartenfels Castle at Torgau which was built in 1443-44 and consecrated by Martin Luther on 5 October 1544. Because of the financial difficulties and bankruptcy of Otto Henry in 1544, the construction of the west wing of the castle took a long time. Wolfgang, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken, who succeeded his cousin Otto Henry in the Duchy of Palatinate-Neuburg, ordered in 1562 to decorate the west wing facing the courtyard with elaborate Sgraffito decorations. The Knights' Hall (the lower panel room in north building) was provided in 1575 by Hans Pihel with a coffered ceiling and wall panels from a rotating timber, both of which are original. The impressive east wing was rebuilt in 1665 by Philip William, Elector Palatine in the Baroque style and complemented with two round towers. Today the castle houses a gallery of baroque paintings, the museum is under supervision of the Bavarian State Picture Collection.

This theme celebrated the link between Latin-American and Mediterranean civilizations. At the end of the relay the Olympic cauldron was for the first time lit by a female athlete. Mexican hurdler Enriqueta Basilio was chosen to complete the final leg of the 2,500 km running relay. The torch had covered a total distance of 13,620 km including the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean.

It is grooved along its length and features a three-dimensional \\"MEXICO 68\\" at the top. It is kept at a Spanish private club, Real Sociedad de Tenis de la Magdalena in Santander, Spain. The torch used as a fuel source a compressed mix of nitrates, sulphur, alkaline metal carbonates, resins and silicones. It burned with a red-yellow flame. Problems with the torch occurred in Barcelona and then again in Medinaceli which saw minor explosions burn some torch- bearers. The cause was investigated and then attributed to \\"the too-rapid contact of a lighted torch with an unlighted one\\". Precautions were put in place to prevent further incidents. =Torch-bearers= For the first time runners from different nations took part in the relay.

In 1813 the house saw its only sale (for continued use as such). This was to William Hare, Baron Ennismore, later 1st Earl of Listowel. He died at the house in 1837 and was succeeded by his grandson William Hare, 2nd Earl of Listowel who seldom occupied it. He sold some grounds for house-building. The house was again let to tenants (which would include Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, who died there in 1842, and Baron Lionel de Rothschild). It remained with the family until four years after the death in 1931 of the 4th Earl, when it passed to his younger son, created Viscount Blakenham. In 1935 the house was sold for building of many more homes, and after the death of the Dowager Countess of Listowel in 1936, it was demolished in 1937 and replaced by two large blocks of private- ownership apartments, Kingston House North and Kingston House South. =First redevelopments= In the 1840s, development began with the construction of houses on Princes Gate and the east side of Ennismore Gardens, as well as a public house, the Ennismore Arms which was the first building of this scheme: built in 1845-7. It stood at the southern end of Ennismore Mews, which ran behind the houses on the eastern side of Princes Terrace.

It is named after Pedro de Valdivia and passes through the districts of Providencia, √ëu√±oa and Macul. Description At its north end, it begins immediately south of the Mapocho River. North of the river, the street continues as Pedro de Valdivia Norte until where it meets the San Crist√≥bal Hill. The short stretch between Andr√©s Bello Avenue and Providencia Avenue is one way southbound, while the rest of the avenue is two-way. The section of the avenue that crosses Providencia is mostly paved with cobblestones and is lined with oriental plane trees. Just past the intersection with Francisco Bilbao Avenue, Pedro de Valdivia Avenue bisects the square of the same name. Pedro de Valdivia Avenue enters √ëu√±oa just south of the median of Diagonal Oriente Street, which continues eastward as Doctor Pedro Lautaro Ferrer Street. Further south the avenue crosses Irarr√°zaval Avenue, the main commercial street of the district of √ëu√±oa. Continuing southward, the avenue narrows to one lane in each direction shortly after intersecting with Grecia Avenue and forms the eastern boundary of the Estadio Nacional sporting complex. South of Rodrigo de Araya Street, which marks the boundary between √ëu√±oa and Macul, several light industries flank the sides of Pedro de Valdivia Avenue. The final section of the avenue is dominated by single-family worker homes. It terminates at a half roundabout, close to the San Joaqu√≠n Campus of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Santiago Metro The eastern portion of the Line 6 of the Santiago Metro runs under Pedro de Valdivia Avenue, stopping at In√©s de Su√°rez, √ëu√±oa and Estadio Nacional stations. History The avenue was created in 1895 to serve as the main spine of an area that was divided into lots for settlement. The area was originally developed as single-family homes for rich people who did want to live in a more rural area. It consisted of mansions surrounded by large gardens. Initially the avenue had a country road character. 1980 marks a milestone year for the northernmost portion of the avenue. The metro extension from Salvador to Escuela Militar and the newly created 11 de Septiembre Avenue were inaugurated in that year, which were built simultaneously. The area begins to have a predominantly commercial character. Many of Pedro de Valdivia Avenue's original mansions and gardens have been replaced by office or apartment buildings. The few that have been preserved are not used as homes, which include the Palacio Falabella and the Palacio Schacht.

The vessel has a displacement of 19,500 tons, is in length, has a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion is provided by two diesel engines, supplying to a single propeller shaft, which is fitted with a controllable- pitch propeller. Cantabria has a maximum sustained speed of , and a range of . The ship's complement is 122. The ship's capacity includes of ship fuel, of JP-5 jet fuel, of fresh water, 280 tons of ammunition, and 470 tons of general cargo. The fuel storage areas are double-hulled. Cantabria can replenish three ships simultaneously; one on each side, plus a third via a stern refueling station. She can carry three Agusta-Bell AB.212, two Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King, or two NHIndustries NH90 helicopters to perform vertical replenishment. Cantabria was laid down in the dry dock of shipyard of Puerto Real, Cadiz, on 18 July 2007; the first ship to be built there in 30 years. The ship was launched by floating on 21 July 2008, and was sponsored by Aurora Diaz Abella, the wife of Miguel √Ångel Revilla, the President of the Autonomous Community of Cantabria. The ship underwent sea trials in the Bay of Cadiz from October to December 2009. She was commissioned into the Spanish Navy on 29 September 2010. The original budget was ‚Ç¨213m but the final cost was ‚Ç¨238m. Export The design has been evaluated by foreign buyers. Canada approached Navantia to provide a design for the Joint Support Ship Project based on Cantabria, but Navantia's proposal was not successful, with Canada eventually selecting an alternative German design based on the . The Norwegian Navy has also expressed interest, but they have announced an order for a replenishment ship from South Korean shipbuilder DSME. Australia considered the design for their replacement tankers, with Navantia competing against the Aegir variant of the built by South Korea's DSME in a restricted tender competition. Navantia's proposal based on Cantabria was announced as the successful design in the Australian tender in March 2016, with an expected in service date for the first of two vessels to be known as HMA Ships Supply and Stalwart of late 2019. The two vessels will be known within the Royal Australian Navy as the Supply class. Operational history Between 2 and 5 July 2012, Cantabria participated alongside the frigates , , and , the submarine , and AV-8Bs of the 9th naval air squadron during exercise MAR-22 on the Atlantic coast of Galicia. Cantabria entering Sydney Harbour in October 2013 Cantabria moored at Gallions Basin in London in January 2016 On 3 July 2012, the Australian and Spanish governments signed an agreement to deploy Cantabria in support of the Royal Australian Navy during 2013. The ship operated in Australian waters from February to November 2013, was used to provide replenishment support to the Australians while the oiler underwent maintenance. While in Australian waters, Cantabria performed 63 replenishments, including of fuel, was involved in the first vertical replenishment of an by an MRH-90 helicopter, and participated in the International Fleet Review 2013. The deployment also allowed over 300 Australian personnel to train on systems similar to those in the Spanish- designed and -class ships being acquired, and allowed the Royal Australian Navy to evaluate the design as a possible replacement for its replenishment vessels. In 2015 the Canadian and Spanish governments concluded a deal where and Cantabria would deploy with Canadian naval forces as their replenishment vessel in 2016. This would be done primarily for training missions. Cantabria would be made available to the Royal Canadian Navy from mid-September to November 2016.

Biography Aram Nalbandyan \\"–êram Bagratovich Nalbandyan\\"(in Russian) was born in 1908 in Karaklise (Kirovakan, now Vanadzor). He lost his father at an early age. His grandfather, a farrier, raised him, implanting a love for work and appreciation for nature. Nalbandyan received his general education at the local school. I A Vardanian ‚ÄúAram Bagratovich Nalbandyan‚Äù p.6-10, Publisher Hayastan, Yerevan, 1988 (in Russian) After school in Karaklise, Nalbandyan started his education in the Department of Physics and Mathematics of Pedagogical Faculty of the Yerevan State University.Yerevan State University Many highly educated Armenians, including graduates from the universities of Moscow, Petersburg and Europe, were teaching there at that time. Among them were professors of physics H. Navakatikyan and H. Anjour, professor of mathematics B. Bagaturyan, professor of physical chemistry L. Rotinyan,\\"Armenian State Pedagogical University\\" and academician A. Hakopyan. They all contributed greatly to the development of young Aram Nalbandyan. As a student, Nalbandyan worked at the laboratory and participated in the scientific club led by H. Navakatikyan. After graduating from the university in 1930, he worked at the department as an assistant and also delivered lectures on molecular physics. In 1931 a new Institute of Chemical Physics (ICP)Institute of Chemical Physics was created in Leningrad (Saint Petersburg). The position of the chief of Institute was assigned to N.N. Semenov, the disciple of the academician A. F. Ioffe. Semenov, the future Nobel prize winner, had big plans for developing science at his institute. To carry out these plans he decided to involve young talented graduates from other cities of the USSR. From the Yerevan State University, Aram Nalbandyan was chosen to go to Leningrad where he joined the group of highly motivated young scientists.I A Vardanian ‚ÄúAram Bagratovich Nalbandyan‚Äù p.11, Publisher Hayastan, Yerevan, 1988 (in Russian) Nalbandyan's research was dedicated to the studies of the kinetics and mechanism of branched chain reactions. Between 1931 and 1950 he investigated in detail the mechanism of oxidation of hydrogen as an example of a branched chain reaction. The collected experimental data and its careful theoretical processing became a brilliant proof of the main principles of the theory of the branched chain reactions that were formulated by N.N. Semenov. \\"Nalbandyan A.B.\\", Chemical Journal of Armenia, Vol. 61, Number 3-4, Dec.2008 \\"chain reactions\\" On the basis of his experimental and theoretical research, Nalbandyan obtained his Candidate (1935) and Doctoral (1943) degrees. During World War II, the Institute of Chemical Physics was relocated from Leningrad to the city of Kazan. There, while his wife Bella L. Nalbandyan (Sinaeva) worked as a Medical Chief of the Army Hospital, Nalbandyan studied methods of production of explosives and their characteristics. For his achievements he was awarded with the medal for Heroic Labor During the Great Patriotic War (1946). In 1949 jointly with V.V. Voyevodsky he published the monograph \\"Mechanism of Hydrogen Oxidation and Combustion\\" .Leenson, \\"Voevodsky Vladislav Vladislavovich\\" This monograph was honored with D.I. Mendeleev's Prize in 1952. From 1957 to 1966 Nalbandyan headed the Laboratory of Hydrocarbon Oxidation at Institute of Chemical PhysicsInstitute of Chemical Physics AS USSR (Moscow). From 1951 to 1959 was the Chair of the Department of Physics at the Moscow Electrotechnical Institute of Communications. Research on degenerated branching in oxidation of organic compounds done by Nalbandyan and his colleagues was an important contribution to the theory of chain reactions. A series of researches on the mechanism of methane oxidation resulted in a proposal for the industrial production of formaldehyde by direct methane oxidation. In 1962 the authors of this work, headed by Nalbandyan, were awarded a Big Gold Medal of the Exhibition of Economic Achievements of the USSR. In 1959 Nalbandyan published a popular scientific book entitled Formaldehyde - a Material for Plastics, written jointly with N.S. Enikolopyan .Z O Sogomonian, R A Karapetian, M V Sarkisian ‚ÄúAram Bagratovich Nalbandyan‚Äù, AS of ASSR, Matherials to the Bibliography of Scientists of the ASSR, v.43, p.32, Publisher AS ASSR, Yerevan, 1988 (in Russian and Armenian) While living in Moscow, Nalbandyan was in close contact with the Armenian scientific community. He always headed the researches of the post-graduate students, trainees and graduates of Yerevan higher schools. In 1959, at the suggestion of the Presidium of the Armenian AS, Nalbandyan founded the Laboratory of Chemical Physics, a new scientific center in Yerevan. In 1960 he was elected a Corresponding member, and in 1963 a full member of the Armenian AS. In 1967 Nalbandyan and his wife moved from Moscow to Yerevan, where he was appointed Director of the Laboratory of Chemical Physics. He was also elected academician-secretary of the Department of Chemistry of the Armenian AS. In 1975 the laboratory was reorganized as the Yerevan Institute of Chemical Physics.Institute of Chemical Physics Until the very end of his life (January 24, 1987) Nalbandyan was the Director and scientific leader of the institute which now bears his name. Scientists of the institute used the kinetic method, developed by Nalbandyan and his colleagues, of radical freezing in combination with ESR-spectrometer for detecting polyatomic radicals in gas phase reactions. They were the first to obtain direct experimental data about free radicals in complex, degenerated branched chain reactions which allowed to investigate chemical reactions at a new, higher level and to approach the ways of controlling them for practical purposes. \\"–êram Bagratovich Nalbandyan\\" In his last years Nalbandyan paid enormous attention to the processes taking place on the surface of the chemical reactor. Based on the results of studies in this field he concluded that depending on the process conditions, the chain branching could occur on the walls of the reactor as a result of decomposition of unstable intermediate compounds, such as peroxides, with the ejection of radicals into the reactor volume where they will continue the chain propagation in the gas phase.I A Vardanian ‚ÄúAram Bagratovich Nalbandyan‚Äù p.84, Publisher Hayastan, Yerevan, 1988 (in Russian) The results of investigations on the kinetics and mechanism of complex reactions were summarized in Nalbandyan's three monographs written jointly with his disciples: A.A. Mantashyan,A.A. Mantashyan I.A. Vardanyan,I.A. Vardanyan and Y.M. Gershenson. Contributions were made to the development of new scientific areas, including the reactions of free radicals in liquid phase, chemical catalysis, and solid phase combustion. In the early seventies Nalbandyan took the initiative to start research on self-propagating high temperature synthesis of valuable inorganic materials at the institute. \\"Academician Aram Nalbandyan\\" (in Russian) These studies were headed by A.G. Merzhanov,A.G. Merzhanov the founder of this scientific direction at the ICP of AS USSR. They are successfully continuing these days. Nalbandyan was actively involved in scientific and social activities; he was Chief Editor of the Armenian Chemical Journal, a member of the editorial board of the journal Khimicheskaya Fizika, a member of the editorial committee of the Armenian Encyclopedia, and a member of the Terminology Committee under the Council of Ministers of Armenian SSR. He also paid attention to establishing and developing international relationships, participated in many international conferences and symposiums, and often gave lectures outside of the USSR. These included a course of lectures in Canada, lectures in the Goettingen University (1973) as a Gauss-Professor, and lectures in the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium. In 1979 he joined the New York Academy of Sciences.

It was translated into Chinese in the sixth century as the Jietuo dao lun Ëß£ËÑ´ÈÅìË´ñ by Sanghapala. The original text (possibly Pali or Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit) is no longer extant, but the work has survived in Chinese. The book was probably written in India and then later brought to Sri Lanka. Some doctrines of the Vimuttimagga have been associated with those attributed to the Abhayagiri monastery by DhammapƒÅla, but this has been disputed in recent scholarship.  Contents  The Vimuttimagga recommends various meditation practices such as Anapanasati, Kasina meditation and Buddha-anussati - recollection of the virtues of the Buddha. Its chapters are (based on the translation by Ehara, Soma & Kheminda): # Introductory Discourse (referencing the three trainings and ultimate freedom)This chapter's introductory stanza in Pali is: \\"'Sƒ´la·πÉ samƒÅdhi pa√±√±ƒÅ ca, vimutti ca anuttarƒÅ; AnubuddhƒÅ ime dhammƒÅ, gotamena yasassinƒÅ.'\\" This verse can be found in both the MahƒÅparinibbƒÅna Sutta (DN 16) and the Anubuddha Sutta (AN 4.1). Vajira & Story (1998) translate this verse as: \\"Virtue, concentration, wisdom, and emancipation unsurpassed ‚Äî These are the principles realized by Gotama the renowned....'\\" # On Distinguishing Virtue # On Austerities # On Distinguishing Concentration # On Approaching a Good Friend # The Distinguishing of Behavior # The Distinguishing of the Subjects of Meditation # Entrance into the Subject of Meditation # The Five Forms of Higher Knowledge # On Distinguishing Wisdom # The Five Methods (aggregates, sense organs, elements, conditioned arising, truth) # On Discerning Truth  Relationship to the Visuddhimagga  The Vimuttimagga bears a striking similarity to the Visuddhimagga by Buddhagosa, and it is highly probable that it had an influence on Buddhagosa. While the Visuddhimagga is a much longer work, both texts differ on several points. According to Bhikkhu Analayo, the Chinese version of the Vimuttimagga states that ascetic practices (dhutanga) can be unwholesome and wholesome while the Visuddhimagga denies that they can be unwholesome, although he notes that the Tibetan VimuktimƒÅrga classifies ascetic practices as \\"wholesome\\". A similar difference can be seen with regards to concentration (samƒÅdhi) which the Vimuttimagga states can be wholesome or unwholesome (micchƒÅ samƒÅdhi/ÈÇ™ÂÆö) while the Visuddhimagga disagrees that it can be unwholesome. Another major difference is in the scheme of the progress of insight, which the Vimuttimagga arranges based on the four noble truths and the Visuddhimagga arranges based on the seven purifications which stem from the Rathavinƒ´ta-sutta. Minor differences can also be seen in the particular schemes of practice. Upatissa gives four categories of ≈öƒ´la while Buddhagosa gives five. Upatissa gives four ways of cultivating Anapanasati, while Buddhagosa gives eight. In addition, the Visuddhimagga identifies forty subjects of meditation (kammatthana) while the Vimuttimagga identifies thirty-eight.

Early life Lliteras was born in the Bronx, New York on July 13, 1949 to Serafin (Frank) and America (Mecca) Lliteras. Originally from Puerto Rico, his father received a bachelor's degree from Emory University (LaGuardia Aeronautical School) in aircraft design in 1959 and worked as a postal clerk for the U.S. Postal Service until his retirement in 1971. His mother, also from Puerto Rico, received her bachelor's degree in nursing from the University of Miami in 1965 and worked for the state of Florida until her retirement in 1991 as the Rehabilitation Nurse Supervisor of Dade and Monroe County, Florida Workers' Compensation. Lliteras attended St. Athanasius in the South Bronx until 1959 at which time his family relocated to Miami, Florida. His interest in the theater was sparked by Robin Werner, a teacher at Riviera Junior High School, who encouraged him to join the cast of the University of Miami Shakespeare Festival, where he served as a member during the summers of 1964 and 1965. He graduated from Southwest Miami High School in 1967. During his teen years, Lliteras worked evenings as an orderly at Baptist Hospital. His extra-curricular activities included wrestling, track, and gymnastics. He was offered a gymnastics scholarship to the U. S. Merchant Marine Academy, but instead enlisted in the U. S. Navy and volunteered for Medical Service Duty (Hospital Corpsman). Vietnam After completing Navy basic training and the U.S. Naval Hospital Corps School in Great Lakes, Illinois, he served aboard the , home-ported in Rota, Spain from February 1968 to June 1968. He attended Field Medical Service School in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina in June and July 1968. In May 1969, he was ordered to the First Marine Division, FMF, Vietnam. Upon arrival in Vietnam in July 1969, he volunteered to join the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion, First Marine Division, where he served as a combat corpsman and diver until July 1970. Midway through his tour, he attended diver training in Subic Bay, Philippines. During his tour in Vietnam, Lliteras participated in twenty long-range reconnaissance patrols deep within enemy- held territory. He also participated in eighty combat dives, eighty bridge checks, three river sweeps, five body recoveries, and three weapons recoveries. He was awarded a Bronze Star Medal (with combat ‚ÄúV‚Äù). Education and employment After his discharge from the Navy, Lliteras attended Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida on the GI bill, majoring in theater. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1973. Upon being awarded an assistantship at the School of Theater Publicity Department, he entered the Masters of Fine Arts program at Florida State University School of Theatre. A member of Phi Kappa Phi honor society, he graduated in 1976 with a Masters of Fine Arts in directing. Afterward, he briefly served on the faculty, where he taught courses in Acting, Directing, and Shakespeare Styles. Theater Among his acting credits while at Florida State, Lliteras‚Äôs signature achievement was starring in the title role in Lenny Bruce. His directing credits included Small Craft Warnings by Tennessee Williams and Two for the Seesaw by William Gibson. His one-act play Touch won a Christian Theater Artists Guild award and was also produced while at Florida State in 1975. Lliteras also studied mime under Chuck Metcalf, playwrighting under Mark Berman, and directing under Amnon Kabatchnik. Lliteras‚Äôs professional credits include directing Steambath at the Reunion Theatre in Houston, Texas in 1973 and Henrik Ibsen‚Äôs Rosmersholm for the New York Theatre Ensemble in 1977. Maritime and firefighting In 1979, Lliteras was admitted into the U. S. Merchant Marines' Calhoun MEBA Engineering School in Baltimore, Maryland and subsequently served aboard the SS Edgar M. Queeny. In 1980, he taught at Rutledge College (now University of South Carolina) in Spartanburg, South Carolina, a proprietary business school. In 1981, he earned a commission in the U.S. Navy and became a Deep Sea Diving and Salvage officer. He attended the Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center in Panama City, Florida in September 1981, and later served aboard the USS Preserver, sailing from Little Creek Amphibious Base in Virginia. In 1985, he resigned his commission to become a firefighter for the city of Norfolk, graduating academically at the top of his firefighting class in 1986. He received the Medal of Honor from the Norfolk Fire and Paramedical Services in February, 1998 for exceptional action in the line of duty in the saving of life and retired in 2000 after suffering a heart attack on a fire scene. Written works Lliteras‚Äôs Haiku, poetry, and short stories have appeared in many national and international journals and anthologies. His first book publication, In a Warrior‚Äôs Romance (1991), includes Haiku and photographs reflecting his experiences in Vietnam. A source of its originality stems from it being the first major application of Haiku to the subject of war. His first three novels, collectively known as the Llewellen Trilogy, trace the spiritual journey of Robert Llewellen, a man who learns how to escape, not from life, but into life. The trilogy includes In the Heart of Things (1992), Into the Ashes (1993), and Half Hidden by Twilight (1994). In his novel 613 West Jefferson (2001), Lliteras revisited the theme of Vietnam through the character of Richard Santos, a returning veteran who encounters fringe elements of the counter-culture in a north Florida town. Lliteras is best known for his biblical novels, which include The Thieves of Golgotha (1998), Judas the Gentile (1999), Jerusalem‚Äôs Rain (2003), The Silence of John (2005), and The Master of Secrets (2007). A book about his firefighting experiences, Flames and Smoke Visible: A Fire Fighter‚Äôs Tale, was published in 2012.Lliteras, D. S. Flames and Smoke Visible: A Fire Fighter's Tale. Faber, Va: Rainbow Ridge Books, 2013. In 2015, his novel entitled Viet Man was published.Lliteras, D. S. Viet Man: A Novel. Faber, VA: Rainbow Ridge Books, 2015. Personal life In 1971, Lliteras married Kathleen Touchstone, a retired educator and author of numerous scholarly works. She dedicated her book, Then Athena Said: Unilateral Transfers and the Transformation of Objectivist Ethics, to her husband.

Ruhallion is named after the historic estate of Drummond Stewart in Perthshire, Scotland.) is an estate in Rumson, New Jersey. The estate house was built in 1887 on a lot originally . The property owner, Edward Dean Adams, was President of the Niagara Falls Power Company and a descendant of U.S. Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, and was featured on the cover of Time magazine on May 27, 1929. He commissioned Stanford White to undertake the design of the house based on a castle in Perthshire, Scotland, also named Rohallion, where Edward Adams and his family had resided. Pan of Rohallion Built in White's traditional shingle style, Adams undertook a substantial remodeling and expansion of the house in the winter of 1913-14. The building was stuccoed after the remodeling. The house was sold to Robert V. White, a Rumson councilman, who remodeled the house in Tudor Revival style in the 1930s. The estate was further subdivided from its original 68 acres to 5 acres today. The Adamses traveled abroad frequently, and would bring back specimens for Rohallion's expansive gardens. The carriage house was also designed by Stanford White, and contained a clock tower similar to his firm's clock tower in the Newport Casino. The tower contained the Rohallion Chimes, cast for Adams to a scale he designed. The carriage house was badly damaged by fire in 1961, and the remnant is visible at 8 North Rohallion Drive.

In carrying out his duties, he downed the highest number of B-29s among the pilots in his air group‚Äîseven confirmed‚Äîand also two North American P-51 Mustangs. He was awarded the Bukosho, the highest award given by the Imperial Japanese Army to living soldiers who demonstrated exceptionally valorous action in combat. Career Ogawa was born in 1917 in Shizuoka Prefecture. He enlisted in the army when he was 18 and was assigned to the 7th Air Regiment based at Hamamatsu Airfield located north of the city of Hamamatsu in his home prefecture. After a few years, he enrolled in the Kumagaya Army Flying School to learn to fly fighters. In August 1938 he graduated as a member of the 72nd class of students. Instead of being posted to a combat squadron in China, he was kept at the school as an assistant instructor. Toward the end of 1941, Ogawa was sent to Manchuria to fly with the 70th Sentai, a fighter wing outfitted with the Nakajima Ki-44 Sh≈çki, called \\"Tojo\\" by the Allies. He flew for three years and gained a high level of skill in piloting fighters. By then, American heavy bombers had begun to bomb Japan itself, so to counter the attacks the 70th Sentai was transferred, in November 1944, to Kashiwa, Chiba, northeast of Tokyo. For this task, the fighter pilots were given newer 20 mm Ho-5 cannon-equipped Nakajima Ki-84 machines, called \\"Frank\\" by the Allies. Ogawa found that the B-29s were more vulnerable when they were maintaining level flight in their bombing runs and could not employ evasive maneuvers. Exploiting this weakness during night actions, he shot two of the bombers down by frontal attack, firing at the nose. He continued with his aerial successes and by August 1945 when the war ended, he had built up a confirmed score of seven B-29 bombers downed, as well as two P-51 Mustang fighters. This made him the highest scoring pilot against B-29s in the 70th Sentai, his air group. By the order of General Shizuichi Tanaka, on 9 July 1945 Ogawa was awarded the Bukosho, the highest military honor given to living IJA personnel during World War II. At the same time he was commissioned as an officer with the rank of second lieutenant. After the war Ogawa became a businessman. He lives in Tokyo.

The highway is approximately long, and passes through mainly rural park land. PR 1 also includes most main roads in the two parks. Because of this, the highway has been divided into five different routes; they are PR 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, and 1E. PR 1C makes up most of the route, while three of the segments are less than a mile long. The route was first drafted by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1933, as a scenic drive between the two parks. It was designated in 1937 as one of the state's originally designated Park Roads and has been extended and altered multiple times since. Route description alt=A road passing through a stone entrance in the grasslands Park Road 1 is divided into five suffixed routes, numbered from 1A to 1E. The longest of the five routes is PR 1C, at approximately long, and the shortest of the routes is PR 1D, at just barely over long. Roads 1A, 1B, and 1D are located completely within Bastrop State Park. Park Road 1E is the only one of the routes to be located completely within Buescher State Park, and PR 1C is the only route that traveling between both parks. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) publishes yearly reports of highway's annual average daily traffic (AADT), with counts usually taken near intersections. PR 1 generally has a low AADT, with most areas of the highway having a daily count below 100 vehicles. The highest traveled point along the road is at PR 1C's intersection with County Route 174 (CR 174), with an average count of 690 vehicles. The least traveled point on the roadway is just east of the CR 174 intersection, with a daily count of just 30 vehicles. No portion of the highway is listed as part of the National Highway System (NHS), a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. =Park Road 1A= Park Road 1A (PR 1A) is a major routing of PR 1 located nearly entirely within Bastrop State Park. The highway forms a loop around the center of the park, and connects other portions of PR 1 to State Highway 21 (SH 21). The highway begins at an intersection with SH 21, on the border of the state park. The highway proceeds southward, before entering the Bastrop Golf Course, and proceeding. The road travels through the golf course, passing the park's entrance facility, before it intersects PR 1D. The highway bends southward, passing a small camping area before it bends eastward. The roadway continues, passing south of the Deer Run and Piney Hill camping areas before passing north of the Creekside Camping area and continuing eastward. The highway bends northward, providing access to the large Copperas Creek camping area and continuing northward past a small parking area. It continues north, providing access to several of the park's hiking trails and a scenic overlook, before it bends westward. After a short distance, the road turns southwest, passing Bastrop State Park Lake, before it turns southward. It travels past the park's barracks and several large camping areas, before reaching its terminus, an intersection that closes the loop. The old earthen dam that impounded Bastrop State Park Lake failed on May 25, 2015 due to heavy rains in the Bastrop area. The volume of rain was more than the spillway could handle. The dam overtopped and then failed. Park Road 1A went across the top of the dam, and the road is now closed at that point. =Park Road 1B= Park Road 1B (PR 1B) is a short routing of PR 1 located entirely in Bastrop State Park. The road provides access to the park's cabins. The highway begins at an intersection with PR 1A on the southwestern edge of Bastrop State Park Lake. The roadway proceeds northwestward a short distance, before bending southward along a small creek. The route passes the creek, and bends northeastward. The highway intersects several small roads leading to the park cabins, including a road leading to the Lost Pines Lodge. The route bends eastward, traveling to its northern terminus, a dead end spot at one of the cabins. =Park Road 1C= Park Road 1C (PR 1C) is the longest segment of PR 1, connecting Bastrop and Buescher state parks through an area known as the \\"Lost Pines\\". The highway begins at an intersection with PR 1A in the central area of Bastrop State Park. It bends northeastward while providing access to the Old Road Bed trail, which leads back to PR 1A. The road continues eastward, bending several times before intersecting Harmon Road, which connects the route to State Highway 71/95. The roadway intersects several small roads as it proceeds southeastward. Before crossing over Alum Creek, the road intersects County Road 190 (CR 190), which leads to the northern portions of the park. The highway proceeds eastward into the \\"Lost Pines\\" portion of the park, where it occasionally intersects private roads. The roadway bends southward before passing the western edge of the Stengl Lost Pines Biological Station. The road continues south into Buescher State Park. The highway runs eastward, intersecting CR 185 while traveling through densely forested area. The roadway bends southward and travels parallel to the park's eastern edge. The road passes a large park complex before bending eastward. PR 1C continues southward, intersecting PR 1E while traveling along the coast of Buescher Lake, towards the park entrance. The route passes the park ranger station before reaching its terminus, an intersection with Farm to Market Road 153 (FM 153) on the park border. =Park Road 1D= Park Road 1D (PR 1D) is the shortest of the five sections of PR 1. The route serves as a driveway for the park's dining hall. The highway begins at an intersection with PR 1A near the beginning of PR 1A's large in-park loop. The highway proceeds eastward, passing a small clump of trees to the north, and a small dirt road running parallel to the route on the south. The route makes a 180 degree bend past the dining hall, and passes north of the small clump of trees. The route then reaches its northern terminus, an intersection with PR 1A. =Park Road 1E= Park Road 1E (PR 1E) is located completely within Buescher State Park. The highway serves the park's cabins and campgrounds. The road begins at an intersection with PR 1C at the entrance to the Lakeview Camping Area, north of Park Lake. The route bends southeast, passing a small parking lot for the Buescher Hiking Trail, and the trail itself, which leads to primitive walk-in campgrounds. The roadway passes the park amphitheater, and intersects a small road that leads to the Cozy Circle Camping Area. The highway bends in a slight backwards S-shape, intersecting several roads that lead to park cabins, picnic areas, and other sites. The road continues southward, reaching an intersection with PR 1C at the park headquarters, where it terminates. History A alt=A beige map with several black lines and explanatory notes Beginning in 1933 during the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) worked on constructing Bastrop and Buescher state parks, including work on a scenic route to connect the two parks. Work on the parks continued through 1939, when construction on both areas, including all roads within the park and the drive connecting them were completed. Park Road 1 was first designated on June 22, 1937 as one of the original eight Park Roads in the state highway system. It was originally designated from an intersection with U.S. Route 290 passing around and through Bastrop State Park. On May 9, 1940, PR 1 was extended past Buescher State Park, to SH 71, and had several smaller roads in Bastrop and Buescher state parks added. On May 21, 1940, the route was minorly rerouted. On May 23, 1951, U.S. Route 290 was rerouted away from Bastrop, with Texas State Highway 21 redesignated to its location. On March 1, 1963, the portion of PR 1 from SH 71 to the south entrance to Buescher State Park was cancelled, with the new southern terminus becoming FM 153.

At some 140 papyrus rolls, the collection constitutes the largest corpus of ancient documents ever found in Jordan and stand as one of the most important papyrological finds outside of the massive yields taken from the sands of Egypt.. Like the Herculaneum papyri, another major non-Egyptian find, the Petra rolls were preserved by virtue of their being carbonized in a fire, but most of the papyri were damaged beyond decipherment and only a few dozen preserve substantial, interpretable texts., . The corpus is an \\"archive\\" in that it contains the private papers of a single family. The man at the center of this seemingly well-to-do household was one Theodoros who served as deacon at the Petra church, but his relation to many of the other people named in the papyri is often unclear.. The family is most likely made up of wealthy landowners of both residential and agricultural lands, despite the slow decline in Petra's economy at the time. One, Gessius, was a famous physician in Egypt.Robert C. Caldwell and Traianos Gagos, \\"Beyond the Rock: Petra in the Sixth Century CE in the Light of the Papyri\\", Thomas Evan Levy, P. M. Michele Daviau and Randall W. Younker (eds.), Crossing Jordan: North American Contributions to the Archaeology of Jordan (Equinox, 2007), pp. 417‚Äì434. The documents in the archive of his family concern private matters like marriages, inheritances and sales, as well as public legal matters, including property disputes and the evolution of systems of tax records through successive political regimes (Byzantine, Roman, and Arab).. Theodoros likely owned land spanning Wadi Araba and Gaza, where he lived for a brief time. In addition to providing a rare glimpse into the affairs of an otherwise anonymous family over several generations, the Petra papyri offer evidence of the relations of a large group of the region's upper class, with approximately 350 individuals from outside the family being named in their personal and legal documents.. The papyri present evidence of the honoring of the wealthy by the Byzantine regime, and the use of specific honorific titles to demarcate them. This kind of honoring occurred well into the Romanization of the city of Petra and the transfer of political power. The papyri are published in an eponymous series, The Petra Papyri (abbreviated P.Petra), which are prepared by teams of scholars from the universities of Helsinki and Michigan and published by the American Center of Oriental Research.. Volumes I, III and IV, comprising some forty-nine documents, have been published to date.. P.Petra II was published last in 2013. Some suggest that though the papyri was written in Greek, often there was content that was written in Greek letters, but phonetically representing content in a pre-Islamic dialect of Arabic.

It is designed as a fast breeder reactor that is passively safe. It has a self-contained fuel source of uranium-235 and uranium-238 which will be partly consumed by fast- neutron fission and, more importantly, converted into more fissile material (\\"breeding\\" plutonium). It should have an operative life of 30 years, providing a constant power source between 10 and 100 megawatts. The 100 megawatt version is expected to be 15 meters high by 3 meters wide, and weigh 500 tonnes. A 10 megawatt version is expected to weigh less than 200 tonnes. To obtain the desired 30 year life span, the design calls for a movable neutron reflector to be placed surrounding part of a column of fuel. The reflector's slow downward travel through the entire length of the column would cause the fuel to be burned from the top of the column to the bottom. Because the unit will be sealed, it is expected that a breeder reaction will be used to further extend the life of the fuel. SSTAR is meant to be tamper resistant, which would prevent the leasing country from opening the reactor to use the generated plutonium for nuclear weapons. The tamper-resistant features will include radio monitoring and remote deactivation. The leasing country will therefore have to accept the capability for remote foreign intervention in the facility. The feature might, however, interfere with possible recovery work during an accident. They are being researched as a possible replacement for today's light water reactors and as a possible design for use in developing countries (which would use the reactor for several decades and then return the entire unit to the manufacturing country). A prototype was scheduled for manufacture in 2015. However its development seems to have ended.

Foster, Robert Minor, and Israel Amter at the time of their March 1930 International Unemployment Day arrests in New York City. The Unemployed Councils of the USA (UC) was a mass organization of the Communist Party, USA established in 1930 in an effort to organize and mobilize unemployed workers to advance party policy goals in preparation for an anticipated final conflict to overthrow capitalism. The UC was the organizational successor of the Unemployment Council of New York, a broad- based organization established by various trade unions in New York City in the spring of 1921, during the economic downturn which followed the termination of the First World War. The organization was dissolved through merger into the Workers Alliance of America, a parallel organization affiliated with the Socialist Party of America, in April 1936. Organizational history =Forerunners= In March 1921 a conference was held in New York City to address the unemployment question.Franklin Folsom, Impatient Armies of the Poor: The Story of Collective Action of the Unemployed, 1808-1942. Niwot, CO: University Press of Colorado, 1991; pg. 222. This effort was widely supported by the local agencies of organized labor, with some 35 independent or associated locals of the American Federation of Labor and the Industrial Workers of the World sending delegates. This Unemployment Conference of Greater New York elected Israel Amter, a member of the underground United Communist Party of America (UCP), as the secretary of a new organization, the Unemployment Council of New York. Shortly after the conference, Amter was embroiled in a raid on UCP headquarters in New York City, in which he was arrested and charged with having committed the crime of criminal anarchy under New York state law. Following his release on bail, Amter threw himself into unemployment work, launching a small newspaper called Jobless and agitating on street corners to crowds of passersby. Meetings of the Unemployment Council of New York were held at which the slogan \\"Fight and Live! Work or Compensation!\\" was advanced and an organizational agenda calling for unemployment relief, employment through public works, and the establishment of subsidized low-cost housing was cobbled together. The group attempted to expand at the local level through the establishment of neighborhood units called \\"Councils of Action.\\"Daniel J. Leab, \\"'United We Eat': The Creation and Organization of the Unemployed Councils in 1930,\\" Labor History, vol. 8, no. 3 (Fall 1967), pg. 300. A national organization was envisioned, to be known as the Worker's Unemployed Council of America.Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pp. 300-301. The Harding administration was moved to action on the issue by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, who drew up the blueprint for a President's Conference on Unemployment, which brought together leaders of industry and labor to further discuss the issue.Folsom, Impatient Armies of the Poor, pp. 223-224. The conference envisioned a city-based solution to the problem. By the end of 1921 some 209 localities had established Mayor's Committees on Unemployment to deal with the issue locally, making use of voluntarism.Folsom, Impatient Armies of the Poor, pg. 224. This activity proved to be largely inadequate to the scope of the problem, with some minor progress made in some localities establishing emergency housing or setting up local employment bureaus to aid in matching up unemployed workers with prospective employers.Folsom, Impatient Armies of the Poor, pg. 225. These efforts did also undercut the radical New York movement as well, with the Communist-backed Unemployment Council of New York rapidly running out of organizational energy.Folsom, Impatient Armies of the Poor, pg. 223. By the end of 1922 the post-war depression more or less had come to an end as the economy stabilized and businesses slowly began to hire more workers again to expand production.Folsom, Impatient Armies of the Poor, pg. 227. The New York-based Unemployed Council movement rapidly faded into obscurity with the improvement of business conditions.Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pg. 301. Despite the failure of the 1921 launch of a mass movement of unemployed workers to gain traction, the Communist Party continued to pursue the issue, reiterating in 1923 its desire to bring about \\"the organization of groups of unemployed\\" in order to \\"force resolute action for the improvement of their position.\\"Resolutions and Decisions of the Second World Congress of the Red International of Labor Unions. Chicago: Trade Union Educational League, 1923; pg. 8. Quoted in Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pg. 301. Such proclaimed intentions were met with no practical success throughout the rest of the comparatively prosperous decade of the 1920s, however. =Depression era reorganization= The global crisis of capitalist economies remembered to history as the Great Depression which began in the 4th Quarter of 1929 accelerated the efforts of American Communists to organize unemployed workers. The party conducted its initial organizational work under the auspices of its radical trade union subsidiary, the Trade Union Unity League, advancing the slogan \\"Fight ‚Äî Don't Starve!\\" and seeking to build a new network of so-called Unemployed Councils.Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pg. 302. As one pioneer scholar of the topic has observed, these Unemployed Councils were conceived as an adaptation of the St. Petersburg Councils of the Unemployed, soviets of unemployed workers which emerged during the Russian Revolution of 1905 and which helped to organize opposition to the Tsarist regime of Nikolai II.Helen Seymour, \\"Organization of the Unemployed.\\" Master's thesis. Department of Sociology, Columbia University, 1940; pg. 10. Quoted in Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pg. 302. The American Communists hoped to establish the Unemployed Council movement as a similar mechanism to turn isolated and atomized unemployed workers towards mass action in the advance of revolutionary objectives. Paid organizers for the Unemployed Councils were set to work attempting to build the organization, searching out potential members in breadlines or queueing for soup kitchens, loitering at factory gates or near employment agency offices, or sitting around near cheap hotels.Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pg. 303. Organizers sought to form local Councils at the neighborhood level, sometimes down to the level of one or two large apartment buildings.Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pg. 304. In addition to the prevailing method of organizing on a geographic basis, in some cases Councils were alternatively organized on the basis of language, including, for example, Yiddish-language locals in New York City.Eleanor Kahn, \\"Organizations of the Unemployed as a Factor in the American Labor Movement.\\" Master's thesis. Department of History, University of Wisconsin, 1934; pg. 106. Cited in Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pg. 304. Historian Daniel Leab indicates that the early Unemployed Councils were far from a rigidly directed and monolithic movement: > \\"During this embryonic period the Councils existed on an extremely unstable > basis. No real interaction existed between the separate components. Rarely > did one Council act in unison with another. Indeed, the only points they had > in common were their demands for more relief and more public works, their > emphasis on the philosophy of class struggle, and their overall Communist > sponsorship.\\" =International Unemployment Day= The Unemployed Councils were thrust into the public limelight in connection with the coordinated mass demonstrations organized by the Communist Party on March 6, 1930, deemed International Day for Struggle against Worldwide Unemployment by the Communist International.Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pg. 305. Under the slogan \\"Work or Wages\\" hundreds of thousands of often ill-organized protestors turned out across the United States to protest against unemployment and to demand government relief. The network of Unemployed Councils was used by the Communist Party as one of the primary mechanisms for building attendance at these public demonstrations. While the majority of these International Unemployment Day demonstrations passed without notable incident, violence erupted in several locals, including scores of injuries resulting from a full scale police riot in New York City, lesser police-protestor violence in Boston, and the use of tear gas to disrupt rallies in Washington, DC and Seattle.Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pp. 306-307. The demonstrations and so-called \\"riots\\" associated with them served to publicize the existence and activities of the Unemployed Councils, as the March 6 events gained widespread attention in the press as the first large scale protests resulting from the recent economic downturn.Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pg. 308. The tiny Communist Party, which counted only about 10,000 members at this time,Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pp. 305-306. was anxious to capitalize upon the massive publicity generated as a result of the March 6 action and rapidly conducted a \\"First Preliminary Conference on Unemployment\\" in New York City on March 29‚Äì30, 1930. This gathering was addressed by a number of prominent Communist Party worthies, including head of the TUUL William Z. Foster, long time Unemployed Council activist Israel Amter, and editor of the Daily Worker Robert Minor.Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pg. 309. The gathering determined to call another convention, larger and more formal, to establish a new national organization which would exist in its own right, independent of Trade Union Unity League auspices. TUUL leader Pat Devine was elected National Secretary of the Unemployed Leagues on an interim basis.Harvey Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade. New York: Basic Books, 1983; pg. 50. Divine's tenure as head of the UC was brief, as by the middle of May he had been \\"called away from the country by personal affairs\\" and replaced by George Siskind.Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pg. 51. =Establishment and early activity= On July 4 and 5, 1930 this founding convention met in Chicago. The gathering was attended by an impressive 1,320 delegates and established for the first time a new independent organization called the Unemployed Councils of the USA. The composition of the gathering was less astounding, however, with some 468 delegates hailing from the Communist Party or its youth section and another 723 connected with the party-sponsored TUUL. The gathering elected Communist Party leader Bill Mathieson as National Secretary of the new organization and named a governing National Committee of 38.Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pp. 309-310. Minor, Amter, and Foster ‚Äî all of whom had begun serving 6-month jail terms in connection with the International Unemployment Day riot in New York City, were named as honorary members of the organization.Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pg. 310. The primary organs of the new Unemployed Councils of the USA were again called \\"Committees of Action,\\" these to be organized at the electoral precinct or ward level and combined to form a \\"City Unemployed Council.\\"Leab, \\"'United We Eat,'\\" pg. 311. The City Unemployed Councils of smaller towns were to be additionally combined to form County Councils. City and County Councils were to elect delegates to state and national Unemployed Council bodies. No formal size requirements were set for Committees of Action until 1934, at which time a minimum of 25 members was established. In August 1930 the Unemployed Councils attempted to give better form to their demands when the group's leaders composed a so-called \\"Workers Unemployment Insurance Bill.\\" This legislative proposal called for the payment of $35 per week for each unemployed worker plus an additional $5 per week per dependent and the creation of a \\"National Unemployment Insurance Fund\\" to be generated through a tax on all property valued in excess of $25,000 and incomes of more than $5,000.Winter, \\"Unemployment Struggles of the Thirties,\\" pg. 59. These monies were to be distributed by a new Workers' Commission elected solely by employed and unemployed workers under the New York Conference's plan. The tactic of mass demonstrations was continued, marked by an October 16, 1930 demonstration in front of City Hall in New York.Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pg. 52. Protestors demanded the city provide unemployment relief, chanting the party slogan \\"We Want Work or Wages\\" and singing the revolutionary anthem \\"The Internationale.\\" The gathering of between 500 and 1,000 people was disbursed by mounted police, causing a melee to ensue in which plate glass windows of nearby businesses were shattered. While protesters and police did battle in the street, inside City Hall a regularly scheduled meeting was being disrupted. The young secretary of the New York Unemployed Councils, Sam Nessin, took to the floor to call the chair of the meeting, Mayor Jimmy Walker, \\"a grafting politician and a crook.\\" Nessin's aggressive accusation provoked the mayor to throw down his gavel and scream, \\"You dirty Red! In about two minutes I'll jump down there and smash you in the face!\\"Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pp. 52-53. Police restored decorum to the meeting by forcibly ejecting Nessin and four Communist companions. The five were thrown down stairs before being beaten with nightsticks and blackjacks, leaving spatter on the walls and puddles of blood on the floor.Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pg. 53. Nessin was hospitalized from the assault, only to be formally charged later with \\"inciting to riot.\\" Despite its one-sided violence the Communist gambit was not wholly unsuccessful, however, as the next day the New York City Board of Estimate suddenly appropriated $1 million for unemployment relief ‚Äî the first time that such an expenditure had been made. The Communist Party published its own program for work among the unemployed on December 9, 1930, issuing a set of 13 specific demands.Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pg. 49. These demands included a call for unemployment insurance providing for payment of full wages, the 7-hour workday, payment of emergency winter relief benefits, and diplomatic recognition by the United States government of the Soviet Union. On December 19, 1930 a conference on unemployment relief was held in New York City, bringing together some 600 delegates, including Communist Party functionaries, members of local unemployed organizations and tenants' organizations, and representatives of the trade union movement.Carl Winter, \\"Unemployment Struggles of the Thirties,\\" Political Affairs, vol. 48, no. 9-10 (September‚ÄìOctober 1969); pg. 58. This gathering issued a convention call for a more formal New York Conference on Unemployment Relief, which was held on January 13, 1931. The January 1931 gathering decided to descend upon Washington, DC with a massive petition demanding Congressional passage of a Federal Unemployment Insurance bill. A door-to-door canvassing campaign to garner was launched to garner petition signatures. =Hunger marches= Another new organization was established under Communist Party auspices early in 1931, the Unemployed Committee for the National Hunger March, headquartered in the offices of the CP's trade union affiliate, the Trade Union Unity League in New York City. This paper organization was established to coordinate a \\"First National Hunger March\\" on the nation's capital to demand federal unemployment insurance and to keep Congress focused upon the unemployment issue. This march was also to demand the granting of emergency winter relief for the unemployed in the form of a lump-sum payment of $150 per unemployed worker, with an additional $50 for each dependent. Other programmatic objectives which the Communist organizers of the march sought to advance included enactment of a 7-hour workday, establishment of a union wage pay scale for unemployed workers, payment of a soldiers' bonus to veterans of World War I, and an end to discrimination against black American and foreign- born workers. The first National Hunger March took place in November 1931, as unemployed workers marched to the capitol from as far as Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco. They arrived in Washington D.C. on December 6, 1931 and attempted to present their demands in the Senate and House chambers, but were not permitted to enter. Another National Hunger March took place again in November of the following year, this time with a total of 3,000 delegates from across the country arriving in the capitol to present their demands for winter relief and unemployment insurance to individual congressmen and senators. =Termination= From 1934 the international Communist movement followed a tactical line known as the Popular Front in which it sought to build political bridges with liberals as well as adherents of other left wing political parties in order to halt the spread of fascism. In accord with this line, the CPUSA sought to unite its Unemployed Councils organization with a parallel group associated with the Socialist Party, the Workers Alliance of America (WAA), and a third group organized by A.J. Muste and his Conference for Progressive Labor Action, known as the National Unemployed Leagues (UL).Philip Bart, et al. (eds.), Highlights of a Fighting History: 60 Years of the Communist Party USA. New York: International Publishers, 1979; pg. 58. On April 8, 1936 a unity convention was held in Washington, DC which formally merged the Communist-sponsored UC and the Muste-sponsored UL into the nominally Socialist WAA. As a condition of unification, the Communists were forced to surrender their old organizational name and to accept the Workers Alliance's title.Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pg. 296. The CPUSA was also forced to accept a minority of seats on the governing Executive Board of the organization, which retained Socialist David Lasser as President and Communist Herbert Benjamin as Organizational Secretary. Communist Party supporter Arnold Johnson would ultimately be elected to head the National Board of the new organization and headquarters were established in Washington, DC. =Legacy= In the estimation of anti-Communist historian Eugene Lyons, the Unemployed Councils were an agglomeration of \\"over 20,000 adherents ‚Äî loosely organized, often [themselves] out of sympathy with their communist spokesmen, yet a sufficient force for demonstration, hunger marches, and sheer nuisance activities.\\"Eugene Lyons, The Red Decade. Indianapolis, IN: Bobbs- Merrill Co., 1941; pg. ??? These individuals and the largely idealistic \\"earnest rank-and file communists\\" who led them are judged by Lyons to have been a \\"relative success\\" in moving issues affecting the unemployed to the national legislative agenda. Lyons contends that \\"top-shelf party bureaucrats\\" undermined the grass roots organization of the unemployed by foisting Third Period slogans upon them such as \\"Down with Yankee Imperialism!\\" and \\"For a Soviet America!\\" As their movement dissipated, \\"the Communists realized their salvation lay in a merger\\" with the Socialist-backed Workers Alliance, headed by David Lasser. While the amalgamation of unemployed groups ostensibly involved the absorption of the Communist UC movement, in reality \\"the Communists took over the Alliance, which became just another Moscow front.\\"Lyons, The Red Decade, pg. XXX. Herbert Benjamin was installed as Secretary-Treasurer of the new organization, solidifying Communist control, and Lasser himself abandoned the Socialist Party for the Communists following a visit to Moscow, Lyons indicates. In the book Poor People's Movements: Why They Succeed, how They Fail, Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward argue that the Unemployed Councils and their radical tactics ultimately helped many people suffering in the Great Depression. In organizing mass resistance to evictions, the Unemployed Councils would lead small bands of unemployed to use \\"strong arm tactics\\" to prevent authorities from tossing people and their belongings into the streets, which resulted in 77,000 evicted people being restored to their homes in New York City alone. They also organized rent strikes and helped the newly unemployed apply for relief aid from the government.Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward, Poor People's Movements: Why They Succeed, how They Fail, (New York:Vintage Books, 1978), , pp.52-58 Noam Chomsky contends that during the Great Depression \\"the Communist Party was the spearhead for labor and civil rights organizing.\\"Chris Hedges (April 19, 2010).

Women's football in Spain is not one of the traditional powers of women's football since the sport has a small following. Although football in the most popular sport in Spain, Men's football usually gets the biggest following. Currently there are two national competitions, the League and the Copa de la Reina (English: Queen's Cup), in the semi-professional club involved structure. History Women's football was recorded as being played as early as the 1910s. Between the 1930s and 1975, women were forbidden from playing football. The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RSFF) did not recognize women's football until 1980. Women did not have a national league until 1988. In 2019 the Spanish FA committed to spending $20 million in the area of women's football. National competition The first teams and the first informal women's football competitions in Spain emerged in the 1970s, although they were not officially recognized by the Royal Spanish Football Federation until 1980, with the founding of the National Women's Football Committee. The first official national competition was the Copa de la Reina, established in 1983. The women's national league began to dispute the 1988-89 season. Primera Divisi√≥n is the national competition for female football players in Spain. Below the Primera Divisi√≥n, there is a second tier called Segunda Divisi√≥n, where its teams are divided into seven groups. The lower tiers are administered by the regional federations. National team The Spain women's national football team has qualified twice to the FIFA Women's World Cup, and thrice in the UEFA Women's Championship.

Their name is taken from the 1970 crime film The Honeymoon Killers.

They were later accompanied by guitarist Michael O'Neill and former Ritual Tension bassist Claire Lawrence-Slater on their 1984 debut album The Honeymoon Killers from Mars, released on the band's own label Fur Records. Drummer Sally Edroso, who became the band's most consistent drummer, joined the band for the release of Love American Style in 1985. Continuing as a trio the band released 1986's Let It Breed, which was recorded with Steve McAllister and composer/producer Mark Kramer. The following year Cristina Martinez, of Pussy Galore and Boss Hog, joined the band as a second guitarist for band's fourth album Turn Me On.

George Tomas Gahan JP (21 July 191224 June 1980) was an Australian politician and Victorian amateur boxer. He was born in Inglewood, Victoria to Benjamin Edward Gahan and Emma Gahan n√©e Walker. The Gahan family later moved to the Melbourne suburb of Prahran where George became a building contractor. At a young age George began training as an amateur boxer. In his mid 30s Gahan attempted to join the Australian Army and defend his country in World War II. Despite being rejected by army due to a duodenal ulcer, Gahan applied a second time, only be to turned away again. This tenacious streak proved to be a valuable attribute as George again turned his focus towards amateur boxing, winning a Yarraville boxing competition and in 1949 in the final of the Welter division was beaten by the Australian champion Bill Seewitz. George had his last fight at 42 years of age when he was stopped in the 2nd round by his opponent 20 years his junior. George's tenacity and fighting talent soon shifted from the boxing ring to the political arena, becoming known as Prahran's George the Giant Killer. From 1957 to 1959, George Gahan was the president of the Prahran-South Yarra branch of the Helping Hand League of Victoria; now known as Inclusion Melbourne. Political career =City of Prahran= Councillor *1958‚Äì1973 Mayor *1965/66 *1970/71 Determined to fight for a seat on the City of Prahran council to improve its service to the people of the area, George Gahan became the Labor Party candidate for the South Yarra Ward in 1954. His campaign slogan was Vote for George the Giant Killer ‚Äì Vote George Gahan 1. Former mayor of Prahran Fred Farrall recalled: > Up until 1953 all appeared quiet on the Town Hall front ... But one morning > when I was walking to the railway station along Osborne Street on my way to > work, I noticed a Holden utility advertising a chap named George Gahan as > the Labor candidate for the South Yarra ward in the forthcoming elections. > It attracted me because of the working Vote for George the Giant Killer ‚Äì > Vote George Gahan 1. I thought that was great, and made up my mind there and > then, or by the time I reached the station, that I would offer the 'Giant > Killer' my support. Gahan was defeated in 1954, and again in 1955, 1956, and 1957. In 1958, despite having lost the council election four times previously, Gahan's tenacity drove him to once again make an attempt to be elected by the residents of South Yarra ward; it was this last attempt that proved successful. For fifteen years Cr. George Gahan represented South Yarra on the Prahran City council. Gahan was elected mayor of Prahran twice, in 1965 and 1970. =Victorian State Parliament= 1955 Independent Candidate for Toorak George Gahan ran as an Independent candidate for the seat of Toorak at the May 28 1955 Victorian State Election. The Australian Labor Party split of 1955 had triggered events that caused a state election in May that year. Neither the anti-communist 'Barry Labor' or the John Cain led Labor Party ran candidates in Toorak. Gahan came in second to the sitting Liberal and Country Party member Horace Petty, and beat the Victorian Liberal Party candidate Geoffrey Kiddle. From Results of the Victorian state election, 1955 (Legislative Assembly L-Z) 1961 Labor Candidate for Prahran George Gahan was elected by the Labor Party to be their candidate for the 1961 Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Prahran. Prahran had been held by the Liberal Party and Australian Cricket champion and Sam Loxton since 1955. On May Day 1961 George Gahan declared: \\"The hour is right for a dramatic rise of the Labor Party ready and willing to work for a new deal for workers\\". Cr. Gahan campaigned in Prahran against the conservative Victorian government of Sir Henry Bolte and their record on housing and unemployment. In his May Day address Gahan declared: > The Premier is a very worried little man these days with the knowledge that > 22 of his 30 seats in the House depend on the preferences of splinter > groups. The hour is right for a dramatic rise of the Labor party ready and > willing to work for a new deal for workers. The economy is going on to the > rocks. Almost 100,000 workers are unemployed and thousands more are working > part time. Prices are rising daily while wages remain at a low level. George Gahan was not only concerned for the workers and unemployed, he actively campaigned for the many pensioners of Prahran, whom he argued were facing rising rents and were increasingly being evicted from their homes. According to Gahan, \\"Some businessmen gave money to the Bolte government to enable it to assist they payment of pensioners rents and help it bluff its way through the elections\\". On election day Labor's George Gahan received the largest number of votes, achieving 45.29% of the primary vote, ahead of the sitting Liberal Party member Sam Loxton whose primary vote fell to 41.69%. Despite winning the popular vote, George lost the election due to the preferential voting method used in Victorian state elections. The Liberal Party was aided by preferences from the Democratic Labor Party (DLP), which had broken away from the Labor Party during the 1950s claiming that the root organisation was too soft towards communism; fears of left-wing influence was causing great concern in Australian society at the time. After DLP preferences were counted the Liberal Party's Sam Loxton won with a reduced two party preferred vote of 52.71%. While the hour may have indeed been right for a \\"dramatic rise of the Labor Party\\" in Victoria, George's vision was not realized until two years after his death when the Australian Labor Party regained the Victorian Government in 1982. From Results of the Victorian state election, 1961 (Legislative Assembly L-Z) Election Scandals As the Cold War dragged on, the Australian Leftwing remained deeply divided and the split within the Australian Labor Party continued to grow. Labor Party candidates were not only being challenged by the conservative Liberal Party, but were facing a major challenge from their former comrades who had split and joined the increasingly powerful Democratic Labor Party. This provided fertile ground for a boisterous and scandalous 1961 Victorian State election campaign. Several days before the 1961 Victorian election, the Victorian Premier Henry Bolte gave an address at a Liberal Party election forum being held in the Prahran Town Hall on Chapel Street. Just before the meeting at Prahran Town Hall opened, a Labor party 'street meeting' was held near the town hall. As the Premier began to address and audience of 500 citizens gathered at Prahran Town Hall, the meeting descended into chaos and speakers' voices were drowned out by continuous heckling. As Premier Bolte attempted to deliver his speech over the noise of hecklers, the public address system and national radio broadcast broke down. The Premier later declared that the radio and speaker systems had been victim to sabotage. As scuffles and arguments broke out at the public gathering, four policemen intervened with one man being escorted from the Prahran Town Hall by police. The Premier Henry Bolte declared it a wicked attempt to keep him off the air pointing the finger directly at the Labor Party of Prahran and suggesting that there were more Labor supporters at his meeting than had ever attended a meeting for the leader of the opposition Mr Stoneham. Sir Henry Bolte told the press: > Look at this rabbel, this is the Labor Party. They are here tonight to > disrupt this meeting simply because they know that Sam Loxton will win > Prahran. They are a poor lot of losers. The people of Victoria wouldn't hand > over to this spectacle we have here...This is the element which would ask > you to let them govern the state. They are booing everything that is decent. Election Day Court Injunction In 1961 the common understanding of the abbreviation L.C.P in Victoria was that of the Liberal and County Parties. On the day of the Victorian state election in 1961 how-to-vote cards baring the words Vote with the L.C.P and printed in the Liberal and Country Party colours of red, white and blue were distributed at polling booths in the seat of Prahran. However, instead of directing people to vote for the Liberal Country Parties' candidate Sam Loxton, they directed people to vote for Cr. George Gahan. The card also bore the words: Authorised by E. M. Bennett, 415 Malvern Road, Prahran, President of Ladies' Campaign Panel of Ratepayers' Association. Voters who were intending to vote for the Liberal and Country Parties' (L.C.P) candidate picked up the Ladies Campaign Panel card and voted instead for Labor's George Gahan. After and hour and a quarter of voting a female voter at Prahran town hall made a complaint about the misleading how-to-vote cards. In an unprecedented move in Victorian electoral history, Justice Adam issued a court injunction restraining Mrs Bennett from publishing the misleading how- to-vote cards and ordered police to stop anyone distributing them. The Liberal Country Parties' candidate Sam Loxton said the injunction was too late and that much of the damage would have already been done. Despite the Ladies Campaign Panel being a part of the \\"Prahran Ratepayers Association\\" of which George Gahan was the president, no link between the misleading how-to-vote cards and the Labor Party or George Gahan was ever proven. When asked about the incident all George Gahan said that it was only unfortunate that his name appeared first on the cards. Political descendants Two of Gahan's sons became councillors on the City of Prahran, and his grandson was a known political lobbyist for lesbian and gay rights. *Cr. Christopher Charles E.

It is located at Gammeltorv and is now only used for ceremonial and representative purposes. Building The city hall was built by master builder Daniel Popp, who had moved to Aalborg from Copenhagen, and was modelled on Johan Conrad Ernst's City Hall there, which was later completely destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. This was a specific requirement from Iver Holck, the county governor (amtmand) at Aalborghus. Designed in the Late Baroque style, the building consists of two storeys and a cellar under a black-glazed tile roof. The yellow-washed facade is decorated with white pilasters and a frontispiece featuring the Danish coat of arms and a bust of King Frederick V.

It was one of the largest tank guns to be fitted on a World War II Japanese tank. Due to late war shortage-induced delays only two were ever mounted in a completed Type 4 Chi-To, neither of which saw combat use. The tank gun was also used on the prototype Type 5 Chi-Ri medium tank and prototype Type 5 Na- To tank destroyer.  Design and use  Front angle close-up of Type 4 Chi-To with Type 5 75 mm tank gun The Type 5 75 mm tank gun was intended as the main armament of the Type 4 Chi-To medium tank, a planned improvement over the Imperial Army's most powerful production tank, the Type 3 Chi-Nu. The first prototype Type 4 Chi-To was delivered in 1944. Though the most advanced and powerful Japanese tank to leave the drawing board, late war industrial and material shortages resulted in only two being completed. The long-barreled 75 mm L/56.4 (4.23 m) tank gun was a variant of the Japanese Type 4 75mm AA Gun, which went into production in 1943.Taki's Imperial Japanese Army: \\"Tank Guns\\" Mounted in the large, hexagonal turret of the Type 4 Chi-To, it was capable of being elevated between -6.5 to +20 degrees. Its muzzle velocity gave it an armor penetration of 75 millimeters at 1,000 meters. Intended Type 4 Chi-To production was 25 tanks per month spread over two Mitsubishi Heavy Industries factories. Late war shortage-induced delays resulted in only 6 chassis being built by 1945 and just two were known to be completed. Neither of the completed tanks were used in combat prior to the end of the war in the Pacific. Incomplete prototype of the Type 5 Chi-Ri The Type 5 tank gun was mounted into a prototype Type 5 Chi-Ri medium tank as its main gun. The Type 5 Chi-Ri used a lengthened version of the Type 4 Chi-To chassis and had thicker sloped welded armor. With the end of the Pacific War, an incomplete Type 5 prototype was seized by American forces during the occupation of Japan. The prototype Type 5 Na-To tank destroyer also used the Type 5 tank gun as its main armament. Only two Type 5 Na-To units were completed by the surrender of Japan. Neither were used in combat.

The attackers were led by Rajab Ali Fakir, the chairman of the Bagerhat sub-divisional Peace Committee. More than 2,000 Hindu men, women and children were killed in the massacre.  Background  The village of Dakra is located in Perikhali Union under Rampal Upazila of Bagerhat District in Khulna Division of Bangladesh. In 1971, Bagerhat District was a sub-division within the Khulna District. Dakra is located on the south bank of the Mongla river, which flows towards the west and falls into the Pasur river near Mongla port. On the north bank of Mongla river, exactly opposite Dakra, lies the Krishnaganj market under Banshtali Union. Dakra was a predominantly Hindu village, having a famous Kali temple. In Dakra lived Badal Chakraborty also known as Noa Thakur, a spiritual person respected by all. After the launch of Operation Searchlight, Peace Committee and Razakar force was organized in Khulna. In April, the Razakars began to persecute the Hindus and loot their properties. By the middle of May, thousands of Hindus from Pirojpur, Jhalokathi, Barguna and Barisal Sadar sub- divisions of undivided Barisal district and Bagerhat sub-division of undivided Khulna district began to use Dakra as the transit, while fleeing to India. On 21 May, an estimated 10,000 Hindu refugees were stranded in Dakra.  Killings  In the afternoon, a group of 20 to 25 Razakars under the leadership of Rajab Ali Fakir arrived in Dakra in two boats. The first boat crossed the Kaliganj market and proceeded towards Madartali canal. The second boat proceeded along the Kumarkhali canal and then made a sudden turn towards Dakra along the Madartali canal. The Razakars from the second boat got down and started firing at the crowd. In the meanwhile, the Razakars from the first boat too got down and proceeded to the Kali temple, firing indiscriminately at the crowd. The crowd started running for cover. Many jumped to the river and were shot at. More than 150 persons were shot in the river. The Razakars resorts to loot, arson and rape in the villages. The beautiful women were taken captives for sexual slavery.  Prosecution  The Government of Bangladesh brought war crime charges against Jamaat-e-Islami leader AKM Yusuf at the International Crimes Tribunal. Yusuf has been charged with genocide of the Bengali Hindu people and has been held directly responsible for the Dakra massacre.  Memorial  No memorial has been built in Dakra to commemorate the victims. In 2010, Dakra Ganahatya Smriti Sangrakshan Parishad held a program to commemorate the victims of the Dakra massacre.

Active during the 1970s, a particularly fertile and creative period in the suburban New York music scene, the band had a loyal following of fans attracted to their unique sound. While many other New York metro-based bands of the time like Ramones and Blue √ñyster Cult had edgier personas and harder sounds, Milk 'N' Cookies crafted a more wholesome, pop sensibility. Although they didn't receive the radio airplay and attention from mainstream labels given to many of their peers, they were influential in their time and have since achieved considerable cult fame for contributions in the cross-section of pop, glam, and proto-punk. History Milk 'N' Cookies was formed in early 1973, when Ian North, an aspiring artist and singer/guitarist from Woodmere, NY met a guitarist named Jay Weiss, who - despite being the better guitarist of the two - opted to switch instruments when the band was unable to find a bassist. The two became best friends and - after recruiting drummer Mike Ruiz - began shopping a demo tape North recorded on a four-track TEAC. At the band's very first show as Milk 'n' Cookies, eventual lead singer, Justin Strauss, shook a tambourine and sang back-ups. \\"After the show a few people told me it didn't look right,\\" North noted, \\"either he should be the lead singer or he should get off the stage.\\" North relinquished lead vocals and Strauss's position was cemented. Milk 'N' Cookies quickly found an audience, playing at Long Island and New York bars, clubs, high school dances, and - in 1974 - for Sparks' manager, John Hewlett. Hewlett agreed to take the band on - and would later play an instrumental role in flying the band to England to record with producer Muff Winwood - but only upon the condition that Weiss be replaced by Sal Maida, a bassist who had previously played with Roxy Music. Without hesitation, North dismissed Weiss from the group. Decades later, he would write that \\"the guilt of that has weighed on my conscience ever since.\\" The first single from the album, \\"Little, Lost And Innocent\\" backed with \\"Good Friends\\", was released by Island Records but when it failed to chart and the label couldn't figure out how to market the band, the album's release was indefinitely postponed. When Island offered Ian North a solo deal, he left Milk 'N' Cookies and moved to London, forming a new group called Ian's Radio, which eventually became Neo. By this time, Sal Maida had quit the group as well, to play with Sparks. It wasn't until the Sex Pistols hit that Island felt they had a way to market the Milk 'n' Cookies album: as punk. But while the band's robust live sound (preserved in a 14-song live bootleg recorded at CBGB) certainly came closer to the punk music played by other bands with which they shared bills at clubs like CBGB and Max's Kansas City, their image was that of \\"well-scrubbed all-American boys who would not have looked out of place in the pages of a vintage Tiger Beat.\\" Without North, who up to this point had written all of the band's music and lyrics, the remaining members of Milk 'n' Cookies recorded a few more demos but no further albums were ever released. Reunion 2005 marked the start of a period of renewed interest in Milk 'n' Cookies. That year the band reunited to play the Radio Heartbeat Power Pop Fest in Brooklyn. The performance coincided with a reissue of their singular album by RPM Records, who would also reissue solo material from Ian North's post-Milk 'N' Cookies period. North, however, was not present for the reunion set or any ancillary press or promotional events. In 2008, Radio Heartbeat would reissue the album yet again. On January 24, 2016, Captured Tracks released a 3xLP boxset, including the band's original album, 2xLPs of rare unreleased demos, and a 100-page hardcover book with liners by members of Sonic Youth, Talking Heads, Ramones, Milk 'n' Cookies, and others. However, the book does not include any contributions from North, the band's songwriter, lyricist, lead guitarist, and co-founder. North took to his blog to share his memories of the band's formation and trajectory and to correct several points he felt are important to the band's history. Primarily, North laments the limited consideration given to founding member Jay Weiss, who he credits not only with the band's name, but as being the first person to take him seriously as a musician. \\"Without Jay,\\" North writes, \\"I would never have been able to put together a band to play my songs.\\" While the reissue gives little credit to Weiss's contributions, it does credit him as the guitarist on the demo recordings. According to North, however, North was the one playing guitar on those tracks. \\"Jay was much better than that,\\" he notes, \\"and I recognize my own guitar playing when I hear it.\\" Discography *Milk 'N' Cookies LP (Island Records) *Milk 'N' Cookies 3xLP (Captured Tracks) References External links *Milk 'N' Cookies 3xLP from Captured Tracks *\\"Ian's History of the Band\\" Category:American power pop groups Category:Musical groups from Long Island Category:Musical groups established in 1973 ","title":"Milk 'N' Cookies"},{"id":"36636750","title":"Field hockey at the 2004 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Men's tournament"},{"id":"36636751","text":"Kuhlarji (; in older sources also Kihlerje,Intelligenzblatt zur Laibacher Zeitung, no. 141. 24 November 1849, p. 28. ,Leksikon obƒçin kraljestev in de≈æel zastopanih v dr≈æavnem zboru, vol. 6: Kranjsko. 1906.

The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.Koƒçevje municipal site It no longer has any permanent residents. Geography Kuhlarji lies in a basin connected by routes to Zdihovo and Morava. Nearby elevations include Ajbik Hill (661 m), Kuchelj Hill (, 653 m), and Bolvik Hill (622 m). There are two karst caves in the vicinity: Wide Shaft () and Dove Cave (). Name The names Kuhlarji and K√ºchlern are believed to be derived from the surname Kuche, which was also attested in the settlement in 1574.Ferenc, Mitja, & Gojko Zupan. 2012. Izgubljene koƒçevske vasi, vol. 2 (K‚ÄìP). Ljubljana: Znanstvena zalo≈æba Filozofske fakultete Univerze v Ljubljani. The name therefore means 'village where the Kuche family lives'. History Kuhlarji was a Gottschee German village. In the land registry of 1574 it had one full farm divided into two half-farms with three landowners, corresponding to a population between 10 and 14. In the 1770 census there were four houses in the village. The village reached its maximum population in 1880, when there were 25 people living in the settlement. Before the Second World War, when the village was destroyed, it had four houses and a population of 17. At the time, the livelihood of the settlement was base on agriculture and peddling.Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937. Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 219. The original ethnic German population, totaling 15 people from three houses, was evicted on 18 December 1941. A Gottschee German woman named Juliana Bauer, together with her son and an elderly Gottschee German man (surname Wittine), refused to leave the village and were still living in one of the houses there until they were forcibly relocated in 1953 in order to make way for a military installation.

Casualties and acts of God The term bond or bondable is primarily used in higher structured lease forms which also include a requirement that the tenant completely backstop casualty and condemnation loss in addition to assuming all other payment and performance obligations generally associated with a standard triple net lease.Ralston, Gary http://www.ccim.com/cire-magazine/articles/real-estate- sale-leasebacks Real Estate Sale-Leasebacks At first glance a bond lease may appear identical to a triple net lease, as the tenant is usually responsible for paying all the property taxes, insurance, and maintenance under both lease structures; however in a bond lease the tenant is obligated to rebuild after a casualty (acts of God included) or continue paying rent should the property be condemned. Lease termination Further, the tenant cannot terminate the lease or seek any rent abatements. Should a material casualty or condemnation occur (a 50% threshold is generally utilized) resulting in the tenant's inability to restore the property to operable condition of its original intended use, tenant may only attempt to terminate the lease upon delivering a rejectable purchase offer which is usually calculated to cover any debt as well as provide a return of any equity. Environmental matters Further, tenant is responsible for all environmental matters, no matter what the cause. It has been argued that following a major casualty or irreparable condemnation, the tenant isn't required to continue paying rent without abatements, even under a bond lease. The argument follows that under certain circumstances such a material event may even be construed as \\"constructive eviction\\" ultimately allowing the bond tenant to walk away from the property without providing a rejectable offer or other termination payment provision. Examples of case law exist however; which uphold the \\"hell or high water\\" clause as well as the constructive eviction argument. When analyzing any commercial lease it is always advisable to have the lease reviewed by legal counsel and pay close attention to the local state real estate laws.

Each series is marked by the type of creatures the novels are about. The Dark-Hunter, Lords Of Avalon, Were-Hunter, Dream-Hunter, Hellchaser, and Chronicles Of Nick series all happen within the same universe and their stories connect. A single book can include elements from multiple parts of each sect of this vast world. They are written by #1 New York Times Best Selling author Sherrilyn Kenyon. Some are written under her penname: Kinley MacGregor. The Dark-Hunters are immortal warriors who sell their souls to the Greek goddess Artemis for an Act of Vengeance against the one who murdered them. Once they've had their revenge, they are dedicated to defending mankind against Daimons (a psychic race cursed by Apollo) and other preternatural enemies. The Were-Hunters are shape- shifters consisting of the Katagaria and the Arcadians. The Katagaria have animal hearts and are animals who can turn into humans. Arcadians are humans who are capable to turning into animals. Both have the ability to time-travel. The Dream-Hunters are Greek gods consisting of the Oneroi and the Skoti. The Oneroi were cursed by Zeus to have no emotions after they played a prank on him. The Skoti are the Oneroi who have succumbed to the emotions they siphon off dreamers and who have become addicted to them. The Oneroi police their activity for fear of Zeus punishing them again and purging their ranks, as he did before. Hellchasers are charged with policing the demons who roam the earth and protecting humanity, and others from them.

Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 195. Other theories derive the name from the surname Kuk or relate the name to the cuckoo. History Kukovo was a Gottschee German village. It is believed to have been founded relatively late because it was not mentioned in the land registry of 1574 or in the 1770 census. There are four caves southwest of the village on the slope of Black Peak (),Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937. Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 224. known in Gottscheerish as Pichl√∂ch, L√∂ckakkh…ôrl√∂ch, Meschnal√∂ch, and Frauengrotte; the last served as a place of refuge for women and children from the village during Ottoman attacks. The settlement attained its maximum population in 1900, with 128 residents. Kukovo had 18 houses before the Second World War and a population of 74.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, p. 230. At that time, the economy of the village was based on agriculture, selling firewood and railroad ties, and gathering berries. The residents of the village were evicted between 27 and 30 November 1941. Kukovo was burned by Italian troops in the summer of 1942 during the Rog Offensive and was never restored. Church The village church was a chapel of ease dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua. It stood until March 1980 and was one of the last churches in the Gottschee area to be destroyed during the communist era. The church dated from the early 19th century. The church's statue of Saint Anthony of Padua is now located at Saint Agnes' Church in Seƒç and its two bronze bells, dating from the mid-19th century, are at Saints Primus and Felician's Church in Ratje. The church was nationalized in 1954 and used as a barn. Lack of maintenance caused the roof to collapse under the weight of snow in February 1969. In 1980 the Koƒçevje collective farm transferred to structure to a private individual in Struge, and in 1981 the building stones of the church were burned to produce quicklime.

The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.Koƒçevje municipal site Its territory is now part of the village of Svetli Potok. Name Both the Slovene name Kumrova vas and German name Kummer(s)dorf literally mean 'Kummer village'. It has been suggested that the root Kummer is related to the dialect world K√ºmar 'impoverished, pitiable person' or to the surname Kummer. The possible designation of the settlement as an impoverished place to live is similar to the naming of the settlements of Slaba Gorica ('poor hill'), Su≈°je ('dry, drought'), and Verderb ('deterioration').Ferenc, Mitja, & Gojko Zupan. 2012. Izgubljene koƒçevske vasi, vol. 2 (K‚ÄìP). Ljubljana: Znanstvena zalo≈æba Filozofske fakultete Univerze v Ljubljani. History Kumrova Vas was a Gottschee German village. In the land registry of 1574, the settlement had three full farms divided into six half-farms and nine owners, corresponding to a population between 32 and 36. In the 1770 census there were 13 houses in the village. The village had a maximum population of 87 people in 14 houses in 1869. In the 19th century, the village had a small industry making woolen coats. On the eve of the Second World War, Kumrova Vas had 10 houses and a population of 32.Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937.

At the time, the economy of the village was based on agriculture, raising livestock, and peddling. The original ethnic German population, consisting of 25 people from nine families, was evicted early in the war. The village was burned repeatedly by Italian troops between May and August 1942. In late June 1942, the Yugoslav Partisans established their Medical Dressing Station No. 3 here for a week before relocating it to a forestry cabin at Travnik Hill in Koƒçevski Rog. The village was never rebuilt after the war. Religious heritage A church dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus stood to the east above Kumrova Vas, dating from 1708. The site was first used as a fortification during the Ottoman wars in Europe, and was later converted into a church. The year 1798, marking a renovation of the church, was carved into the semicircular entryway. The shingled roof of the bell tower burned during a lightning strike in 1865. The church had three altars by the mid-18th century, dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus, Christ on the Via Dolorosa, and Christ on the Mount of Olives. The church was remodeled in 1933. The church was not repaired after the war and its furnishings disappeared. The location of the church's statues and paintings is unknown today. A small chapel dedicated to the Precious Blood stood northeast of the village. It had a polygonal chancel walled on three sides and a wooden bell-cot over the entrance. Two bells, cast in 1607 and 1839, hung in the bell-cot until 1917. The smaller one bore the inscription Zur Ehre Gottes go√ü mich Elias Sombrath in Laibach 1603 ('I was cast for the glory of God by Elias Sombrath in Ljubljana, 1603'). The chapel was destroyed during the Second World War and was not rebuilt.

It was published in 1994 and written by Francesca Simon and illustrated by Tony Ross. The book is a collection of short stories about the same characters, along the lines of the Just William books. Plot =Horrid Henry's Perfect Day= Horrid Henry is a horrid boy who loves doing unimaginable horrible things. He throws food, he snatches things, he pushes, shoves and pinches. He has a younger brother called Perfect Peter. He is an extremely perfect boy who does uncountable good deeds. He always says \\"Please\\" and \\"Thank You\\", he loves vegetables and refuses cake and he never ever picks his nose. One day, Horrid Henry wonders what would happen if he were perfect?! So ‚àí the next day, Henry doesn't wake Peter up by splashing water on his head as usual, and Peter and his parents wake up late. Due to this, Henry and Peter are late for a class. Back at home, Henry doesn't bully Peter, instead, he reads a book about super-mice. At dinner time, Henry helps lay the table and ignores Peter's whining that he always lays the table. When the family eat spaghetti and meatballs, Henry does not kick Peter or slurp his food or leave behind his vegetables. Peter wants Henry to become horrid again and tries many ways to get Henry to hit him but Henry is resilient. When Henry's Mum gives Henry some fudge cake and a kiss for being so good, Peter can't stand it any longer and flings his plate at Henry but hits Mum. Mum screams at Peter to go to his room and when Henry laughs, she sends him to his room too. The story ends with Henry being surprised that being perfect was so much fun.Horrid Henry \\"Horrid Henry's Perfect Day\\" =Horrid Henry's Dance Class= Henry and Peter have to go to the school's dance class taught by Miss Impatience Tutu, a very impatient woman who claims she is patient that Henry hates. The class has to play a concert and everyone is practicing for it. Impatience Tutu makes Henry sit behind a false bush for being horrid at her class so he won't embarrass everyone at the concert. When its time for the concert, Henry decides to make his part bigger and by doing so, makes Impatience Tutu stop the concert this story then ends with Henry being happy to finally go for karate.Horrid Henry \\"Horrid Henry's Dance Class\\" =Horrid Henry & Moody Margaret= Horrid Henry has an archenemy, and that is Moody Margaret. Margaret lives next door to Henry, is in Henry's class and owns all the things that Henry's goody-goody parents don't let him have. This is the only reason that Henry plays with Margaret. The two of them are playing pirates and squabbling over who is going to be Captain Hook and Peter is begging to not be the prisoner. When Margaret reluctantly hands over her Captain Hook role to Henry and takes his role as Mr. Smee and Henry orders her and Peter to walk the plank, she decides not to play pirates. Henry gets fed up and orders her to play but Margaret shrieks at him. Since no one can shriek as loud as her or as piercingly as her, Henry gives her back the hook and she decides to eat something. Selfish Henry doesn't want to share his food with her and gives her horrible choices. When he mentions \\"Glop\\"(A dish of horrible food mixed together), Margaret decides that she and Henry make the yuckiest Glop of all and eat it. After putting in horrible ingredients, Margaret eats a spoonful of it and doesn't show how much she hates it, in fact stating that it is good. When Henry doesn't want to eat it but takes a tiny spoonful, Margaret is about to do an unrevealed horrible thing if Perfect Peter had not intervened. He asks for some food and Henry gives him the glop!Horrid Henry \\"Horrid Henry and Moody Margaret\\" =Horrid Henry's Holiday= Henry hates holidays. He has a very specific idea of what constitutes an ideal holiday, but his parents always have other plans. But when his family tell him they are going camping in France, he gets excited. However, the place isn't as good as Henry thought it would be. A rainy campsite with filthy toilets and he gets angry again. He tries to knock down tents and play horrible music but Dad stops him. Just as they are about to eat baked beans, it rains. The Family sleeps in the tent soundly but Henry can't due to the sharp rocks and mosquitoes. When they wake up, the family goes for a walk and Henry has to collect firewood. Henry uses the dry, wooden pegs holding up the tents as firewood and creates a big fire. Henry dreams that he is floating but when he wakes up, he finds that he actually is floating! The tent has been flooded, has collapsed and the rain has soaked everyone wet. Henry then takes his family to the campsite that he wanted to go with modernized things and the story ends with the family eating crisps and watching TV.

This weapon system was first publicized following its approval on March30, 2006 by Sun Qin (), Deputy Director of the National Defense Committee.K/YBS500 The complete system weigh 960 kg,http://www.hmly666.com/bbs/viewthread.php?tid=31671 and several versions have been developed since its public debut, mainly in five categories, with different version within each category: The most basic version cluster bomb, which is dropped over the target by aircraft. The bomb can be either guided, or unguided, and when guided, it can be achieved either via sub-munition or the guidance system on the bomb itself (in this case the sub-munitions are unguided). To better protect the aircraft by increasing the standoff distance, a glide bomb category of K/YBS500 was also developed. A computer simulation training of this version of the weapon has been publicized in several Chinese websites. The gliding module including the folding wings and control surfaces is made of composite material and aluminum alloys, similar to that of LS PGB. The third category of K/YBS500 is an aerial weapon dispenser used like the British JP233, German MW-1 and Russian KMGU.K/YBS500 weapon dispenser A variety of sub-munitions can be carried and deployed, which can be either guided or unguided. The munition dispenser itself can be discarded to reduce the weight of the aircraft after delivering the payload, thus allowing the aircraft to have greater chance of escaping enemy air defense. The fourth category of K/YBS500 is an air-to-surface rocket version, derived from the gliding bomb version, with reduction of weapon payload in exchange of rocket motor engines. The guidance of this weapon system is depend on sub-munitions, so if sub-munitions are not guided, neither is the rocket. The fifth category of K/YBS500 is an air-to-surface missile, where the guidance is on the missile itself, and although sub-munitions can be carried, the missile is usually armed with a single warhead instead. K/YBS500 has been in Chinese service and it can be deployed in most aircraft currently in Chinese inventory, such as fixed winged aircraft and some of helicopters.

Several proposals have been made since 1947, varying in design and specific location, but none of them have ever been implemented because of cost, environmental and other concerns. History =Origins= The idea for the Southern Crossing dates back to the 1940s when several additional bridges across San Francisco Bay were studied. After the Bay Bridge crossing opened in 1936, connecting Rincon Hill in San Francisco with the Key Mole in Oakland via two high-level bridges and a tunnel through Yerba Buena Island, vehicle traffic exceeded estimates almost immediately; by 1945, even with gasoline rationing, traffic was 191% of the estimates made during planning, and would reach an average of 69,000 vehicles per day by 1946. A second crossing was deemed necessary and studies were initiated to determine the best location and configuration. =First proposal (1941): Hunters Point to Bay Farm Island= A study completed on November 18, 1941 conducted by a joint Army-Navy Board concluded that a high-level bridge between Hunters Point and Bay Farm Island was feasible at an estimated cost of $53.2M. The high-level bridge was preferred to a low-level lift bridge. The western terminus would have been on the south side of the existing Hunters Point Naval Shipyard and the eastern terminus would be on the southwest shore of Bay Farm Island. However, no immediate need was identified for a new bridge, and the project was shelved. =Second proposals (1947): Parallel Bridge and Southern Crossing= Southern Crossing: Potrero Point to Alameda On January 25, 1947, another joint Army-Navy Board published a study which concluded that a combination of causeway and tube from San Francisco (near Army Street/Potrero Point ) to Alameda was preferred. From Alameda, the route would run north through the Posey Street tube to a point in Oakland near the present-day western terminus of Interstate 980. This was essentially the same as alternative no. 12 from the contemporaneous California Department of Public Works (DPW) study. Both routes recommended by the two 1947 studies were endorsed by Charles H. Purcell, the director of the California DPW on November 10, 1947; however, because of limited budget, the more expensive Southern Crossing option would be built after the Parallel Bridge. During the development of the Joint Army-Navy Board study, a public meeting was held on August 13, 1946, where ten alternative alignments for a second crossing were suggested. One group, based in San Francisco, advocated for a low-level causeway allowing the extension of the transcontinental rail line from Oakland; another group, based in the East Bay, proposed a high-level span for automobiles only. The California state government, represented by engineer F. W. Panhorst, agreed with the East Bay group and further advocated that to provide the maximum reduction in traffic on the Bay Bridge, the western terminus should be on Telegraph Hill or Rincon Hill . The August 1946 meeting was also notable for the first public presentation of the Reber Plan, which called for an immense dike between San Francisco and Oakland wide, reclaiming of land from San Francisco Bay and eliminating the need for another bridge. The 1947 Joint Army-Navy Board considered 29 different alignments before concluding the causeway-tube was the preferred option. Parallel Bridge The first of the California state government studies was published a week later, on January 31, 1947, which concluded that another trans-Bay crossing was feasible and recommended that it be located close to the existing Bay Bridge. This alignment was later named the Parallel Bridge. Map of 1947 second trans-Bay crossing study alternatives The main reason to duplicate the existing route was to provide immediate relief to Bay Bridge traffic; the crossing further south from Potrero Point to Alameda was estimated to divert only 20% of existing traffic, and the southernmost proposal studied, from Hunters Point to Bay Farm Island , was estimated to divert only 5% of existing traffic. The alternative western terminus at Telegraph Hill was rejected on the basis of existing traffic patterns and freeway connections, and the alternative eastern terminus on the S.P. or Oakland Mole was rejected not only because it would require a long high-level span to avoid interference with the existing shipping channel, but also that such a span would also interfere with flight operations at Naval Air Station Alameda. The 1947 study also determined the feasibility of extending existing railroad terminii for the Western Pacific Railroad, Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe, and Southern Pacific from Oakland to San Francisco; of the three, SP already had the option of using the Dumbarton Cut-off, and WP and AT&SF; used buses (for passengers) or ferries (for freight); both a high-level bridge and a tunnel were ruled out as the required grades for the high-level bridge could not be achieved without excessively long approaches, and the tunnel would require conversion to electric locomotives. However, a low-level bridge accommodating rail traffic was considered for the southernmost Hunters Point to Bay Farm Island crossing as alternative no. 11. Alternative no. 5 would have used parallel tubes on a continuous radius curve of , providing the shortest overall distance at . Each concrete tube would be in outer diameter, and would be built on land in segments, which would each be floated into position then sunk in place. Ventilation would be provided through the roadway space, connected to ventilation structures at the two terminii. A similar underwater route, with terminii at the Market Street Subway (slightly north of Rincon Hill) and the S.P. Mole was eventually built as the Transbay Tube for BART in the 1960s. Alternative no. 7 included what would have been the longest suspension bridge in the world for the western portion, slightly longer than the Golden Gate Bridge at long overall, composed of a main span flanked by two side spans. Of all the alternative options studied in 1947, no. 7 had the shortest distance to span on the western portion. Four true southern crossings were studied in 1947 (alternatives no. 10, 10A, 11, and 12). 10 and 10A differed in the configuration of the lower deck; 10 called for two truck lanes and two railroad tracks, while 10A omitted the tracks entirely. Both 10/10A and 12 included the cost of an additional tube to augment the existing Posey tube from Alameda to Oakland, which was eventually constructed as the Webster Street tube in 1963. Alternative no. 11 devoted the lower deck entirely to four railroad tracks, as the anticipated vehicular traffic was low. It included a long vertical lift span. Alternative no. 12 would use four tunnels on the western half, each containing two lanes of traffic, approximately long overall to provide a wide navigation channel; the eastern portion of the crossing would be at the water's level, consisting of a trestle long and a mole long. {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"font-size:80%;text- align:center;\\" + Proposed second trans-Bay crossing study alternatives (1947) - ! rowspan=2  No. !! rowspan=2  Western terminus !! rowspan=2  via !! rowspan=2  Eastern terminus !! colspan=2  Structure !! rowspan=2  Cost - !

In 1948, the Toll Crossings Division reiterated that a southern crossing was \\"entirely feasible\\" but recommended the expansion of the existing Bay Bridge with the Parallel Bridge alignment instead, which could be completed in 1954 at an estimated cost of . Preliminary plans for both the Parallel Bridge and Southern Crossing were prepared in 1948, which were reviewed by a board of consulting engineers in 1949. Because both bridges could not be financed simultaneously, the California Toll Bridge Authority resolved to complete the plans for the Parallel Bridge on March 23, 1949. Local and state leaders failed to align their support on a single proposal. In May 1949, San Francisco mayor Elmer Robinson testified before the California State Assembly in support of the Southern Crossing. Director Purcell went before Congress in July 1949 to request permission to expand the right-of-way on Yerba Buena Island to allow construction of the Parallel Bridge. Work on both the Southern Crossing and Parallel Bridge projects was halted on June 30, 1950 after disputes about the priority, alignment, and purpose of a second bridge could not be reconciled. An attempt to revive a second trans-Bay crossing failed to pass the California State Legislature during the 1951 session. =Third proposal (1949, 1989, 1999): Wright/Polivka Butterfly Wing bridge= At about the same time, architect Frank Lloyd Wright and engineer Jaroslav Joseph Polivka unveiled the reinforced concrete \\"Butterfly Wing\\" bridge in May 1949 before Bay Toll Crossings. The Butterfly Wing bridge was first presented to the public in May 1953 before a sold-out audience at the San Francisco Museum of Art. A long model of the Butterfly Wing bridge was built for the 1953 presentation; it was later displayed locally in shops, malls, and was included in a traveling exhibition before being used as a prop in the 1988 film Die Hard. Polivka had previously submitted preliminary plans to DPW for a Southern Crossing bridge in February 1947; his initial design featured an immense long concrete arch spanning the navigation channel, which was unprecedented in length, size, and material. Polivka is credited with piquing Wright's interest in bridge design; they began their collaboration later in 1947, resulting in the Butterfly Wing bridge proposal for the Southern Crossing. The Butterfly Wing design was derived from a crossing designed by Wright in 1947 over the Wisconsin River near Spring Green, Wisconsin for the Wisconsin Highway commission. The final design carries six lanes of traffic over twin long diverging arches providing of vertical clearance above the bay's main ship channel. Another source claims the pair of main arches were long and afforded of vertical clearance. The concrete \\"tap-root\\" piers were hollow to add buoyant support to the structure. The original alignment had a western terminus near Third and Army and an eastern terminus on Bay Farm Island . The design included a hanging park and parking in the middle of the arched section, making the Butterfly Bridge a destination in addition to a crossing. Polivka and Wright's design, using reinforced concrete, was designed to be half the cost of a conventional steel bridge, provide lower maintenance costs, and resist earthquake damage. However, such proposals never got beyond the drawing board because of cost concerns. The Butterfly Wing bridge design has been revived occasionally since it was first announced; in 1989, the Oakland Museum of California exhibited the bridge drawings and model, and that year, Aaron Green and T. Y. Lin proposed the Wright/Polivka design should be built between San Bruno (western terminus at the junction of I-380 and the Bayshore Freeway) and San Lorenzo (terminating into Hwy 238), carrying eight lanes of traffic and BART tracks. In 1999, the Butterfly Wing design was again promoted, this time as a candidate design for the eastern span replacement of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, winning Oakland mayor Jerry Brown's support, although by that time, the design had already missed the deadline for replacement proposals, which had been during a three-day workshop held in 1997. =Fourth proposal (1953‚Äì58): Potrero Point to Bay Farm Island= Approved alignment for the Southern Crossing (1954) In 1953, the legislature passed a bill to build the Southern Crossing with the alignment spanning from San Francisco near Third and Army Streets (Potrero Point )to near Bay Farm Island in Alameda. The western approaches would include connections to the Bayshore Freeway at 26th Street; the Southern Crossing would also connect with a proposed future freeway at Army Street and an extended Embarcadero Freeway. At the eastern end, the southern crossing would connect to the Alameda County road along the bayfront near its intersection with Kilkenny Road. direct URL The Southern Crossing alignment specified by the legislature had not been previously studied in the 1941 and 1947 reports. After the Southern Crossing Bill was passed, at a public hearing held on August 17, 1953, the Navy announced plans to extend its seadrome runways south from NAS Alameda, which would interfere with the planned direct alignment of the Southern Crossing, and the Department of the Army subsequently denied the Southern Crossing application on November 3, 1953. A revised alignment was designed to route around the restricted area, and the Army granted a construction permit on April 8, 1954, contingent on the construction to start within five years and complete within ten. In the 1954 Progress Report, the approved design for the Southern Crossing was largely a low-level causeway not to exceed in height to avoid seadrome interference, although the eastern approach would provide a vertical clearance of to allow the passage of crash boats from NAS Alameda. A tube section would be built across the navigation channel to allow the passage of ships deeper into the Bay. Traffic would be carried in six lanes, divided into two three-lane causeways and three two-lane tubes, and grades would be limited to 3%. The total planned length of the 1954 Southern Crossing was . {class=wikitable style=\\"font-size:100%;text-align:left;\\" +Southern Crossing (1954 design) - ! Structure !! Image !! Length !!

In March 1956, the 1955 Supplement report was issued covering the legislative amendments made that month changing the San Francisco approaches to the Southern Crossing. direct URL (this version has the full text, but omits the figures) (this version reproduces the figures, but omits Part I of the text) Typical Bay Tube section (1956) The Southern Crossing design was updated again in October 1956; the 1956 Progress Report detailed further changes to the San Francisco and Bay Farm Island approaches mandated by legislative action. Chapter 40, direct URL Chapter 67, direct URL By 1956, the Southern Crossing was ready to post requests for bidding; because there was \\"considerable opposition to raising tolls on the Bay Bridge\\" from their current , the cost of the Southern Crossing meant the project would have to be built in stages. The overall length of the Southern Crossing was reduced slightly to with the revised approaches, but retained the same basic structure: two three-lane roadways carried on mole and viaducts, with a three-tube (each with two unidirectional lanes) section crossing the navigation channel. In San Francisco, the northern approach would connect with the Embarcadero Freeway; the southern approach would connect with the Southern Freeway, and the direct connection with the Bayshore Freeway was dropped. Both approaches would be double-decked, with three unidirectional lanes per deck. On Bay Farm Island, the Southern Crossing would split into two separate approaches at the Bay Farm Island Bridge; the two would then would connect with the Eastshore Freeway and the Posey and Webster Street tubes. In addition, the 1956 Progress Report considered the effect of the Southern Crossing on traffic over the San Mateo‚ÄìHayward Bridge (acquired by the State of California in September 1951) as well as the planned Transbay Tube. To explore the financial feasibility further, DPW commissioned a study from Smith Barney & Co., which concluded \\"the Complete Southern Crossing is not feasible as presently authorized at a basic toll rate of 25 cents for both the Bay Bridge and the Southern Crossing\\"; the California Toll Bridge Authority then directed Bay Toll Crossings to develop a Minimum Southern Crossing plan. One key statute passed in the 1957 session imposed a July 1, 1958 deadline; if funding was not finalized for the Southern Crossing by then, the project would be dissolved. Chapter 2316, direct URL Another authorized funds for the construction of the Webster Street Tube without tying it to the larger Southern Crossing project. Chapter 866, direct URL Under the Minimum Southern Crossing plan of 1957, the same general alignment and design was retained, but the approaches were pruned back to a single interchange near Third and Army in San Francisco and a connection to the Bay Farm Island Bridge in the East Bay. In May 1958, the Southern Crossing project was defunded and abandoned; direct URL plans made to expand the capacity of existing crossings (plans completed in March 1957 to remove the Key System tracks on the lower deck of the Bay Bridge; additionally, plans completed in October 1958 to double the capacity of the San Mateo Bridge) meant a second crossing was no longer needed. In addition, by this time, plans for the Transbay Tube for public transit service across the Bay had been sufficiently developed to forecast relief for Bay Bridge traffic. =Fifth proposal (1962‚Äì72): Southern alignments= Three-way bridge and San Mateo County Southern Crossing alignments proposed in 1962, shown between existing Bay (north) and San Mateo (south) bridges Yet another alternative alignment, proposed in the November 1962 Trans-bay Traffic Study, would connect India Basin to both Alameda and Bay Farm Island ; the bridge would run to a mid-Bay junction off the southern shore of Alameda and then fork north and east, respectively. The 1962 study also included a more southern alternative alignment between Sierra Point and Roberts Landing in San Lorenzo, the first Southern Crossing proposal to include a terminus in San Mateo County. Subsequent public hearings, held in 1964 and 1965, showed strong popular support for both of the two proposed routes, with home geography dictating which route was favored, and in 1965, the legislature authorized a study to compare the two alternatives as well as ferry service. direct URL The results of that study were published in the 1966 Southern Crossing of San Francisco Bay report. For the India Basin‚ÄìAlameda‚ÄìBay Farm Island alternative, the main navigation channel off Hunters Point would be spanned by either a high-level bridge (providing at least of vertical clearance) or a subsurface tube (allowing at least of draft). On the western end, the approach would connect to a proposed Hunters Point Freeway which would run north-south to the east of the existing Bayshore Freeway. The eastern approach would split into two at the toll plaza, located approximately offshore from Alameda; the northerly leg would continue to a new set of tubes parallel to the existing Posey and Webster Street tubes, while the easterly leg would continue to Davis Street in San Leandro. The estimated cost of this alignment would range between $300.8 million (bridge) to $397.1 million (tunnel), depending on the option chosen to cross the navigation channel. The Sierra Point‚ÄìRoberts Landing alternative was first proposed in 1959; the total length of approximately would be low-level trestle or earthen barrier, with a high-level bridge over the navigation channel, similar to the second San Mateo‚ÄìHayward Bridge. The earthen barrier option was a variant of the Reber Plan, calling for a series of locks to preserve a navigation channel south, but otherwise allowing residential development on Bay fill south of the barrier. The total estimated cost of this alignment ranged between $209.7 million (trestle) to $352.6 million (barrier). Of the two alignments, the India Basin‚ÄìAlameda‚ÄìBay Farm Island option was expected to have the greatest relief for Bay Bridge traffic and was recommended in the 1966 study report. Under the contemporary rules, the amount of money diverted from toll revenues to fund BART meant that construction of either alternative would be delayed to 1968; if the diversion was increased from $133 million to $178 million, however, the Southern Crossing would be delayed or potentially unfeasible. The earthen barrier option of the Sierra Point‚ÄìRoberts Landing alignment was ruled out as the economic benefits would not justify the additional cost. India Basin‚ÄìAlameda‚ÄìBay Farm Island Preferred Southern Crossing alignment of 1962 (1971 report) The Hunters Point/India Basin‚ÄìAlameda‚ÄìBay Farm Island alignment was ultimately selected in April 1966 with a cable-stayed girder bridge over the main channel using an orthotropic deck. The design of the channel span was directed by the noted local architect William Stephen Allen, designed to harmonize with the neighboring Bay and San Mateo bridges. The Bay Conservation and Development Commission granted permits for construction of the Southern Crossing on November 6, 1969. Opposition to the Southern Crossing was led by the Sierra Club and notable local politicians, including state senator George Moscone; Assemblymembers Willie Brown, John Burton, John Foran, and Leo McCarthy; and Supervisors Dianne Feinstein, Terry Francois, Robert E. Gonzalez, Robert H. Mendelsohn, and Ron Pelosi. In San Francisco, Francois and Gonzalez argued the estimated $500 million cost of the Southern Crossing project would be better spent on rapid transit, and Mendelsohn and Pelosi introduced a resolution to require the project to evaluate its impact on BART. Support for the Southern Crossing was largely from legislators representing districts outside the Bay Area; local polls from early 1972 showed that nearly two-thirds of Bay Area residents opposed the Southern Crossing. The scheduled start of construction was delayed until late 1971, and the anticipated completion date was 1975. Because of its potential to siphon riders (and revenue) away from the nascent BART system, the California State Assembly ordered the Toll Bridge Authority to reconsider the Southern Crossing in 1970. direct URL In February 1971, the Toll Bridge Authority concluded in a report published after holding two public meetings in San Francisco and Oakland that \\"It is in the public interest to begin construction on this needed facility [the Southern Crossing] as soon as possible.\\" At the Oakland meeting, held the preceding December, chief engineer E. R. \\"Mike\\" Foley of the Toll Bridge Authority argued the Southern Crossing was needed to support cargo traffic and to relieve congestion on the Bay Bridge, but local politicians opposing the new bridge cited pollution concerns and the possibility of increased traffic jams due to induced demand. The 1971 report concluded that BART revenues would be minimally affected, as the Southern Crossing would provide access to southern San Francisco and northern San Mateo County, while BART would serve downtown San Francisco instead. At the time, the Bay Bridge was operating at well over its designed capacity, serving 165,000 vehicles per day, on average. BART was anticipated to divert 10% of existing traffic to provide some relief, but by 1980, it was projected the Bay Bridge would see 190,000 vehicles per day while BART would move 143,000 trans-Bay commuters daily. If the Southern Crossing had been built, it was projected that in 1980, Bay Bridge traffic would be reduced to 148,000 vehicles per day, the Transbay Tube would serve 138,000 daily commuters, and the Southern Crossing would be operating at 105,000 vehicles per day. A ghost ramp (lower level) on the Interstate 280 viaduct in San Francisco, originally intended as part of an interchange with the Southern Crossing In March 1971, Assemblymember Robert W. Crown (D-Alameda) sponsored AB 151, which would give the final decision to proceed with the construction to the legislature, taking that choice away from Bay Toll Crossings. Although it passed both houses with overwhelming majorities, AB 151 was vetoed by Governor Ronald Reagan, who stated the citizens of the Bay Area should be allowed to vote for the approval of the Southern Crossing directly. The Assembly was unable to override the veto, and two regional measures were put on the ballot for six Bay Area counties in the June 6, 1972 election: one that would give the final approval for the Southern Crossing to the legislature, which voters approved, and another (Proposition A) which would issue bonds to fund the Southern Crossing, which was defeated. =Sixth proposal (1989‚Äì91): San Bruno/San Leandro= Alternative 4: Mid-Bay Bridge In 1989, State Senator Quentin L. Kopp introduced Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 20, which funded a study to analyze the need for another crossing option (whether tunnel, bridge, or ferry) between Alameda County and San Francisco or San Mateo County. direct URL The resulting Bay Crossings Study was published by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) in 1991 and the scope was not limited to an automobile bridge; the eleven alternatives studied were: # High-Speed Ferry and Operational Upgrade # Southern Crossing Bridge # Southern Crossing tunnel # Interstate 380 to I-238 bridge (with BART) # Interstate 380 to I-238 tunnel (with BART) # BART SFO/OAK airport connection # BART Alameda to Candlestick connection # New BART Transbay Tube # Airport people-mover connection # Railroad Airport connection # Intercity rail connection Of these, the 1991 Bay Crossings Study evaluated five: alternatives 1, 4, 6, 8, and 11. The proposed alignment for a new Mid-Bay Bridge (Alternative 4) ran between San Bruno and San Leandro ; two variants of Alternative 4 were studied in 1991, one with four lanes and another with eight lanes and BART tracks. The narrow four-lane bridge was estimated to cost $2 billion. The eight-lane bridge was estimated to cost the most out of all the alternatives studied ($4 B), but would carry the greatest number of trips, providing the most relief to Bay Bridge traffic. This Southern Crossing initiative eventually died after facing opposition from environmental groups. =Later proposals (2000+)= U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein revived the Southern Crossing proposal in 2000, writing a letter to California Governor Gray Davis that a study of an alternative bay crossing \\"must be undertaken promptly\\", citing projections of growing traffic congestion. After two years, MTC published the 2002 San Francisco Bay Crossings Study, an update to the prior 1991 study; in it, MTC concluded that a Mid-Bay Bridge between Interstate 238 in Hayward and Interstate 380 in San Bruno would cost up to to build. Other alternatives that were studied in this period included a second Transbay Tube, widening the San Mateo‚ÄìHayward Bridge to eight lanes, and Dumbarton Rail Corridor service; of these, the Mid-Bay Bridge proved to be the most polarizing, the second Tube was the costliest, and Dumbarton Rail was called \\"one of the least expensive and most cost-effective of the transbay improvements studied.\\" Several alternatives were screened out during preliminary evaluations as unfeasible, including a road and rail bridge between I-238 and Candlestick Point, a Mid- Bay BART tube, and a SFO‚ÄîOAK airport rail shuttle. The idea was then shelved until 2010 when the Bay Area Toll Authority voted to spend up to to update the 2002 study. The resulting San Francisco Bay Crossings Study Update (2012) concluded that due to increased costs no new trans-Bay crossings were feasible. The Mid-Bay Bridge was estimated to cost $12.4 billion, improvements to the San Mateo‚ÄìHayward and Dumbarton bridges were estimated at $2.9 billion each, and a second BART tube would cost from $8.2 to $11.2 billion, depending on the alignment. In December 2017, in a letter to the MTC, Feinstein, along with Congressman Mark DeSaulnier, called yet again for a new span across the Bay.

In the land registry of 1574 the village had three full farms divided into six half-farms with seven owners, corresponding to a population between 25 and 30. The village attained its maximum population in 1880, with 56 people living in nine houses. It had five houses and a population of only 32 in 1931. At this time, the economy of the village was based on raising animals, tending vineyards at Rodine, and selling firewood, logs, and wooden goods. The original inhabitants were evicted from the village on 24 November 1941. It was burned by Italian troops in the summer of 1942 during the Rog Offensive and was never rebuilt.

Ivanhoe also is exploring for new copper discoveries on its wholly owned Western Foreland exploration licences in the DRC, near the Kamoa-Kakula Project. History In October 2012, the company held an IPO on the Toronto Stock Exchange, raising $300 million, and valuing the company at $2.5 billion. In August 2013 the company changed its name to Ivanhoe Mines, taking advantage of Friedland's right to that name. In 2015, Ivanhoe sold half of its interest in the Kamoa copper project to Zijin Mining Group, a Chinese mining company, for US$412 million. In April 2017 Ivanhoe announced it had confirmed the new Kakula West discovery in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Reported assays returned 8.86 metres grading 5.83% copper that included a higher grade intercept of 6.17 metres grading 6.84% copper. The discovery extended the Kakula along a confirmed strike length of 6.8 kilometres. In January 2019, Ivanhoe Mines reported an unprecedented 22.3-metre intersection of 13.05% copper in a shallow, flat- lying discovery at the Kamoa North Bonanza Zone on the Kamoa-Kakula mining licence. Drill hole DD1450 intersection included grades of up to 40% copper and is within 190 metres of surface. In February 2020, the initial mineral resource estimate for the Kamoa North Bonanza Zone included 1.5 million tonnes of Indicated Resources grading 10.7% copper, at a 5% cut-off. In February 2020, Ivanhoe released an independently verified, updated Mineral Resource estimate for the Kamoa-Kakula Copper Project in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Kamoa-Kakula Project Indicated Mineral Resource now stands at 1.4 billion tonnes grading 2.7% copper, at a 1% cut-off grade, and the project's Indicated Mineral Resource now stands at 423 million tonnes grading 4.68% copper, at a 3% cut-off grade. International mining consultant Wood Mackenzie has ranked the Kamoa-Kakula Copper Project as the world's fourth- largest copper discovery, with copper grades that are the highest by a wide margin of the world's top 10 copper deposits. Construction of the Kakula Mine, the first of multiple, planned mining areas at Kamoa-Kakula, is making excellent progress. Initial copper concentrate production from the Kakula Mine is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of 2021. Development of the Platreef and Kipushi projects also are advancing towards production.  Operations  Ivanhoe has three projects: * The Kamoa-Kakula copper project, located near Kolwezi in the DRC. An independent preliminary economic assessment (PEA) issued in February 2019 indicates that Kamoa-Kakula has a potential production rate of at least 18 Mtpa. Once this expanded rate is achieved, Kamoa-Kakula is projected to become the world's second largest copper mine, with peak annual production of more than 700,000 tonnes of copper. * The Kipushi zinc project near the city of Kipushi in the DRC's Haut- Katanga province. Kipushi has an estimated 10.2 million tonnes of measured and indicated Mineral Resources grading 34.9% zinc. * The Platreef Project, a platinum mine in Limpopo province, South Africa. Platreef is expected to eventually be one of the world's largest platinum mines.

Many were dead and missing. Many places were affected. Landslides and flash floods were triggered by a sudden cloudburst which left 31 people dead while 40 are reported to be missing. Details The following are the states that were affected by the torrential rain that resulted in flash floods. =Uttarakhand= Uttarakhand was the state that was most affected by the torrential rain. Ten people died and 38 others are missing as a result of the flash floods. Several houses were washed away and the Char Dham yatra has been suspended leaving the pilgrims stranded. 19 labourers at the Assi Ganga hydel power project are reported to be missing in the Uttarkashi region. Nearly 30 homes have been washed away in the Garhwal region after the Gangotri bridge collapsed. A major chunk of the Gangotri National Highway has also been washed away. Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the Uttarakhand state disaster management forces are currently involved in the rescue operations in the Uttarkashi region. \\"Nearly 2000 people have been affected by the floods. 200 families have been evacuated from low lying regions of Uttarkashi to higher ground\\", said the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand Vijay Bahuguna. Two children were killed in a house collapse in the Karnaprayag area of Chamoli district. Another child was washed away in the flash floods at Pokhri area of the district where landslides continued, blocking the highways leading to Badrinath. In the Gangotri area, Bhagirathi is reported to be flowing above the danger level with people being evacuated to safer areas. =Himachal Pradesh= Flash floods hit the Palchan region in Himachal Pradesh. Two bridges and a road which connects Manali to Rohtang were washed away on the night 4 August 2012. About 120 people have been evacuated from the affected areas. A government school, an under construction hydropower project and many electricity poles were washed away in the floods. =Uttar Pradesh= Water logging occurred in the district of Moradabad. =Jammu and Kashmir= The Kathua district in Jammu and Kashmir was affected as water levels in the Ujh River rose. Twenty-three people were rescued and 90 families living near the Chenab were evacuated. Effects Business Standard reported that the Northern Grid, which collapsed on 30 and 31 July, would be likely to come under renewed pressure as the power generation in Uttarakhand was stopped due to flash floods. The major hydel power projects were shut down following torrential rains that hit the state. In Uttarkashi district, the flash floods have caused damage to three state-run small hydel projects, which are controlled by Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd, resulting in their shut down. Due to the shut down, Uttarakhand would fall short of 18-20 million units per day during a monsoon season.

The tribe is attested in the Miracles of Saint Demetrius as having formed a sklavinia near the city of Thessaloniki, under a king named Perboundos in the mid-7th century. They were apparently a powerful tribe. After Perboundos was arrested and executed by Byzantine authorities, the Rhynchines rose up and allied themselves with two other nearby sklaviniai, the Sagudates and the Drugubites, and launched an unsuccessful siege of Thessalonica (in 676‚Äì678 AD). In the 8th and 9th centuries the Rynchinoi, Vlachorynchinoi and Sagudates moved eastwards into Chalkidiki. Porphyrius Uspensky found a 17th-century manuscript at Kastamonitou that mentioned the Richenoi ( or Vlachorichenoi) and Sagudates having come from Bulgaria across Macedonia to Mount Athos, at the time of the Iconoclasm. The name \\"Vlachorynchinoi\\" suggests mixing of Vlachs or Romance-speakers and the tribe.

Dotor Jalmi (Dotor means Doctor in Konkani), as he was widely known all over Goa, was just not a legal luminary or a medical practitioner or a firebrand legislator; he was the most respected Dotor by a common Goenkar. Born to a poor family he had to struggle a lot in order to complete his education. He completed MBBS from Bombay University and was the first doctor from Gaud Maratha Samaj community formerly a part of Gauda and Kunbi community. Being an active member of the Rashtra Seva Dal, Jalmi was strongly influenced by socialist ideology. Jalmi has also served the state as a minister for health, law, revenue and legislative affairs for a brief period in 1990, when seven Congressmen defected to topple the Congress government. He was the minister in the alternative government of Progressive Democratic Front that lasted for hardly eight months. The three-time MLA of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), Jalmi was also the most dynamic leader of the opposition in the Assembly elected in 1994. Though a medical practitioner, Jalmi was always more interested in legal matters and was considered an encyclopedia of the Constitution of India as well as parliamentary affairs. He was the MGP MLA for three consecutive terms since 1984 and had won with highest number of margin of 7753 votes in 1989 election. Jalmi has however remained in the history of Parliamentary democracy with his landmark decision in 1990 that speaker cannot be part of defections. He was part of the same government of the PDF in 1990 that had elected defector speaker Dr Luis Proto Barbosa as their chief minister. His decision was later upheld by the Supreme Court of India.http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/571597/ Starting as a grassroot level worker of the MGP, Jalmi had come up from the MGP cadre to become the party's executive member in 1980, central executive member in 1983 and then elected as the MLA in 1984 Assembly election from Kumbarjuve constituency in a 30-member Goa, Daman and Diu Assembly. He entered active politics as the Sarpanch of Tivrem-Orgao in 1978. He was also the activist of the Gaud Maratha Samaj since 1976. Jalmi was also active in the sports field and was the active member of the Union Sports Club since 1968. Contrary to his progressive views in the party as well as in the Assembly, Jalmi was caught up in a controversy for the first time when he wholeheartedly supported the controversial Nylon 6,6 project coming up in his Priol constituency, at Keri. In spite of fielding Savoi Verem sarpanch and MGP worker Mohan Verenkar as an independent candidate against him by the anti-Nylon 6,6 movement, Jalmi scrapped through with mere margin of 1342 votes. Jalmi, a democrat otherwise, however was also made the target by the whole Goan media when he supported the clause in the Right to Information Act that tried to suppress the press freedom. He otherwise always remained favourite of the media with his studied views on any issue and raising technical and legal issues to counter the opponents.

Forty kilos of explosives had been placed inside an Opel CorsaLa masacre terrorista de Madrid, La Vanguardia, 23 June 1993, p11 killing seven and causing material damage to 14 nearby buildings, resulting in 90 families having to leave their homes temporarily. The second attack occurred an hour later on Serrano Street, 50 metres away, in a high security zone near the American and French embassies. It injured school children who had been waiting for their school bus. The car used was a red Ford, containing four or five kilos of explosives, which had been parked there a half hour before the attack. The exact target of the second bomb was unclear. Reactions The attack was condemned by all the main Spanish political parties and led to the King of Spain cancelling his participation in the Centre of Defense Studies. In the Basque Country, a five- minute break in the working day in memory of the victims was organised. The Spanish Ministry of the Interior blamed the attacks on ETA's Madrid commando, which had been reconstituted in 1991. Police sources identified Mar√≠a Soledad Iparraguirre, alias \\"Anboto\\" or \\"Marisol\\", as one of those involved in the attack.

The new clue led Spain's National Court to reopen its own investigation and summon convicted terrorist Jes√∫s Garc√≠a Corporales as a formal suspect. Romero's investigation became the subject of a series of special reports published in El Espa√±ol in 2013 in which he indicated that members of ETA's Madrid cell were directly responsible for the attack, and where he also highlighted how the Spanish State had neglected to do its part both in preventing the bombing and later pursuing guilty parties. In 2018, Romero turned the story into one of Spain's most listened-to podcasts, Las Tres Muertes de Mi Padre (My Father's Three Deaths), which received the 2018 Ondas Award, one of Spain's most prestigious journalism prizes.

After serving with British military units during the Second Anglo-Boer War in South Africa, he worked as an engineering fitter with the New Zealand Railways Department workshops at Petone. He enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force at the outbreak of World War I, and served with distinction before dying of wounds after the attack on Chunuk Bair, Gallipoli, in August 1915. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (second only to the Victoria Cross for officers), was Mentioned in Despatches, and was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Army to receive the French Legion of Honour decoration during the war. The memorial flagstaff at Petone railway station appears to have been erected in his honour, and was the site of New Zealand's first public Anzac Day ceremony on 25 April 1916. Early life Norman Hastings was born in Auckland on 14 July 1879, the son of Frederick and Fanny Hastings. He was raised in Brooklyn, Wellington, and his military service began in the 1890s when he served as a private for two and a half years with the Wellington City Rifles. Boer War Hastings took part in the Second Anglo-Boer War in South Africa, serving with British troops despite his New Zealand roots. He enlisted into 34 Company Army Service Corps on 10 August 1900. Holding the rank of conductor, he remained with the company until 19 February 1901 when he was transferred at his own request to a mounted unit, Rimington's Scouts and Guides. Shortly before Hastings had arrived, Major Frederick Damant had taken over command of the unit and it later became known as Damant's Horse. Working with Major General (later General) Bruce Hamilton's 21st Brigade in Cape Colony to drive out Boer forces led by Christiaan de Wet, Hastings gained the rank of sergeant and was wounded in action twice while serving with the unit. For a six-month period, he was detached from Damant's Horse, serving in Hamilton's field intelligence unit, during which time he commanded a group of native scouts. Between the wars After the conclusion of the Boer War, Hastings returned to New Zealand. In 1905, he recommenced his military service by enlisting in the Karori Defence Rifle Club. He served with the Club until 1908 when he married Hilda May Barr of Masterton. On 1 June 1909, Hastings was appointed Commander of the Dominion Scouts, E Squadron 2nd Mounted Rifles Regiment, a volunteer unit in Wellington, holding the rank of acting lieutenant. He later passed a promotion examination and was formally commissioned as a lieutenant with effect 1 December 1909. In 1911 he tried unsuccessfully to gain an appointment to the permanent staff of the New Zealand Army as an adjutant or instructor. During a period of significant reorganisation of the New Zealand Military Forces, Hastings was instead posted to A Squadron, 6th (Manawatu) Mounted Rifles, which was established as a new unit on 17 March 1911. Serving in a part-time capacity, he then successfully passed the examination for promotion to captain and was granted that rank with effect 16 October 1912. During this period Hastings settled in Petone where he commenced working for the New Zealand Railways Department as an engineering fitter and foreman, and with his wife raised two children: Francis Norman and Marjory. World War I After the New Zealand Government declared war on Germany it decided to establish the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) for overseas service. As a part of this force, the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment was formed and began concentrating at Awapuni racecourse in Palmerston North from 12 August 1914. Hastings joined the unit in the Manawatu and was attested on 13 August 1914, enlisting into the 6th Squadron as second- in-command under Major Charles Dick.Wilkie, Alexander, Official War History of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment, Wellington, Whitcombe & Tombs Ltd, 1924, pp. 1‚Äì5. The unit formed part of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade commanded by Brigadier-General Andrew Hamilton Russell, and departed New Zealand on board the troopship Tahiti on 15 October 1914. This vessel was one of twelve troop ships that carried the main body of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in a convoy escorted by Allied warships. After departing New Zealand, the convoy stopped at Hobart, Albany and Colombo before arriving at the Suez Canal on 1 December 1914. In Egypt, the New Zealand Expeditionary Force established a training camp at Zeitoun, with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade remaining behind as the New Zealand Infantry Brigade participated in British operations against the Ottomans in the Suez Canal area in February 1915, before taking part in the invasion of the Gallipoli Peninsula in late April 1915.Taylor, Richard, Tribe of the War God: Ngati Tumatauenga, Napier, NZ: Heritage, 1996, p.49. =Service at Gallipoli= alt=Tents in a military camp alt=A map depicting the movement of military forces The Gallipoli landings were strongly resisted by Ottoman forces, and reinforcements were required. Thus, in early May the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment was advised to prepare for embarkation for Gallipoli to join the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. On 12 May 1915, Hastings arrived at Anzac Cove and the following day his regiment occupied Walker's Ridge. From then on, Hastings displayed strong leadership as the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment anchored the brigade's position in defence of the ANZAC perimeter. On 19 May, the Ottomans launched a major offensive that saw 42,000 Ottomans attack the 17,000 ANZACs holding the beachhead. In response, the 6th Squadron prepared to take part in a counterattack, but this was subsequently called off.Wilkie, Alexander, Official War History of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment, Wellington, Whitcombe & Tombs Ltd, 1924, pp.14‚Äì26. After the Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiment attacked and seized a new outpost (initially called No. 3 Outpost) on 28 May, the 6th Squadron relieved them and began digging defences.Pugsley, Christopher, Gallipoli: The New Zealand Story (2nd ed.), Auckland: Reed, 1998, p.230. The outpost was then handed over to another squadron who came under a sustained attack throughout 29 May and were forced to withdraw on 30 May, while the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment continued the battle without rest for 28 hours.Kinloch, Terry, Echoes of Gallipoli: In the words of New Zealand's Mounted Riflemen, Auckland: Exisle, 2005, p.149. The unit history noted that during this time, Hastings \\"... performed most useful and hazardous work ...\\" closely reconnoitring the enemy's position and furnishing \\"... a most accurate report on the situation, which proved of great value\\".Wilkie, Alexander, Official War History of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment, Wellington, Whitcombe & Tombs Ltd, 1924, pp.33‚Äì34. As the outpost was relinquished around midnight on 30 May the Ottomans aggressively followed up the withdrawing troops until Hastings led an advance along the ridge that enabled heavy fire to be brought down on the enemy's position. Hastings' men then launched a \\"most effective\\" attack with bayonets that \\"... broke the Turkish onrush\\". The ANZACs subsequently established a new outpost closer to the existing line, No. 3 Outpost, with the position now held by the enemy referred to as the Old No. 3 Outpost.Stowers, Richard, Bloody Gallipoli: The New Zealanders' Story, Auckland: David Bateman, 2005, p.104. =August Offensive= In early August 1915, Hastings was heavily involved in the Allied offensive that attempted to break the deadlock of the Gallipoli campaign through the simultaneous push for the heights above Anzac and lodgement of a new British force at Suvla Bay. After dark on 6 August the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade commenced its task of clearing the Ottomans from the lower slopes of the Sari Bair range beginning with the Old No. 3 Outpost. During this attack Hastings led two platoons of Maori Pioneers in destroying barbed- wire entanglements in the Sazli Beit Dere before the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment stormed Destroyer Hill and Table Top.Cameron, David W., Australian Army Campaigns Series ‚Äì 10: The August Offensive at ANZAC, 1915, Canberra, ACT Australia: Australian Army History Unit, Commonwealth of Australia, 2001, p.42. Hastings' party assisted the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment by attacking trenches in the Old No. 3 Outpost and took some prisoners on the northern end of the position.Wilkie, Alexander, Official War History of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment, Wellington, Whitcombe & Tombs Ltd, 1924, p.47. Hastings subsequently assumed command of the 6th Squadron after its commander, Major Charles Dick, was wounded in the assault on Destroyer Hill, which opened the way to Table Top and allowed the New Zealand Infantry Brigade to seize Rhododendron Ridge in preparation for the attack on Chunuk Bair. The Wellington Infantry Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel William George Malone managed to secure the summit of Chunuk Bair in the early hours of 8 August, and took heavy casualties throughout the day until reinforced by the Otago Infantry Battalion and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment in the evening. Promoted in the field to major, Hastings commanded the 6th Squadron on Chunuk Bair on 8 and 9 August as the New Zealanders attempted to hold the position against fierce Ottoman counterattacks. Casualties were heavy and on the morning of 9 August Hastings was wounded when a bomb exploded, shattering his leg. His evacuation was significantly delayed by the terrain and congested approaches to the heights, and the dangers encountered by his stretcher bearers, but he was successfully admitted to the casualty clearing station down on the beach.Wilkie, Alexander, Official War History of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment, Wellington, Whitcombe & Tombs Ltd, 1924, p.59. Death It is unclear what happened to the wounded Hastings, and there appears to have been confusion at the time as he was subsequently reported as \\"missing, presumed dead\\". Hastings had been evacuated to North Beach into the care of the 16th (British) Casualty Clearing Station, near Embarkation Pier, which had been constructed for the purpose of evacuating wounded during the August Offensive but had been abandoned when it came under heavy rifle and shell fire after just two days. As he could not be evacuated to a hospital ship it is likely that Hastings died while at the casualty clearing station and was buried in haste due to the massive number of Allied casualties. Despite his missing-in-action status Hastings was gazetted as a temporary major on 16 December 1915, and subsequently confirmed as a substantive major on 11 February 1916. In the meantime, following the evacuation of the Allied force from Gallipoli, a court of inquiry was initiated at Zeitoun on 17 January 1916. The inquiry was concluded at Serapeum on 3 March 1916, where Colonel William Meldrum, the commander of the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment, determined that Hastings had probably died of wounds received in action on 9 August 1915. Meldrum later wrote to Hasting's wife advising her of his conclusion, and noting the last time her saw her husband was when he was being carried down to the beach. Hastings' assumed burial place in the Embarkation Pier Cemetery was marked with a special memorial by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission after the war. Awards and decorations alt=A list of names on a stone memorial tablet In recognition of Hastings' outstanding bravery and leadership the award of the Distinguished Service Order was gazetted on 14 January 1916 for distinguished service in the field on Gallipoli.Haigh, Bryant & Polaschek, Allan, New Zealand and the Distinguished Service Order, Christchurch: John.

He was also Mentioned in Despatches on 28 January 1916 in recognition of his excellent service and appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour by the President of France.Brewer, Mark, 'New Zealand and the Legion d'honneur: The Great War, Part One', The Volunteers: The Journal of the New Zealand Military Historical Society, 37(2), November 2011, p.114. This French award is uncommon to New Zealanders: fewer than 100 awards have been made, and Hastings was one of only 14 members of the NZEF to be decorated with the Legion of Honour during the war.Brewer, Mark, 'New Zealand and the Legion d'honneur: The Great War, Part Three', The Volunteers: The Journal of the New Zealand Military Historical Society, 38(1), July 2012, pp.20‚Äì23. =Ribbons= * 90px Distinguished Service Order (Great Britain) * 90px Queen's South Africa Medal (three clasps: Cape Colony, Orange Free State, Transvaal) (Great Britain) * 90px King's South Africa Medal (two clasps: South Africa 1901, South Africa 1902) (Great Britain) * 90px 1914‚Äì15 Star (Great Britain) * 90px British War Medal 1914‚Äì19 (Great Britain) * 90px Victory Medal with Mention in Despatches (Great Britain) * 90px Chevalier de la L√©gion d'Honneur (France) Commemoration Hastings was commemorated on the stone laid below the Petone Anzac Memorial Flagstaff by members of the New Zealand Railways Department. The memorial was the focal point of the first public Anzac Day remembrance ceremony in New Zealand on 25 April 1916, which was attended by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, William Massey, and other members of Parliament. Even though Hastings' death had not been confirmed at the time, it is believed that the desire to commemorate him was a key motivation in the erection of the memorial. Hastings' name is also included on the Memorial Tablet engraved with the names of 446 New Zealand Railways Department workers who were killed during World War I, which was unveiled in the Railways Head Office at Wellington on 28 April 1922 by the Prime Minister.

In a negative review Vince Ripol writing for Allmusic described the group as artistically stranded and while still capable of brilliant moments, the album lacked the focused direction of prior efforts like Fresh Fruit in Foreign Places and the group's tour de force, Wise Guy. He describes Darnell as too clever for his own good, but does single out \\"Dancin' at the Bains Douches\\" for setting a standard that the surrounding material fails to meet, although \\"Agony...Ecstasy\\" and \\"Call It a Day\\" are close runners-up. In a positive review, Robert Christgau writing for The Village Voice praises Darnell for his consistency and calls the album a typically elegant and literate dance album in which mortality impinges attractively.

The President of the Federation of University Students (Federaci√≥n Estudiantil Universitaria - FEU), he was a founding member of the Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil (DRE), a militant organization that played an important role in the Cuban Revolution to oust President Fulgencio Batista. He had the nickname \\"Manzanita\\", meaning \\"Little Apple\\".

Three Minutes of Truth Echeverr√≠a and his colleagues took part in an assault at the National Radio Station of Cuba on March 13, 1957, at the time of a music program which most of the Cuban people usually listened to so that Echeverr√≠a's anti-Batista speech would be broadcast to the whole Cuban nation. Echeverr√≠a estimated that the rioters could only occupy the radio station during three minutes, therefore he had to prepare a speech which lasted three minutes at most. Echeverr√≠a finally managed to finish his speech right at the 181st second. He managed to leave the station unharmed and on the way to the University of Havana, just a few blocks away, he opened fire on a police patrol. He was killed during the shootout on the sidewalk of the north side of the university, where there is now a memorial plaque. Echeverr√≠a's speech was mentioned in the poem \\"Three Minutes of Truth\\" written by the Soviet-Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko.

Originally designed for a defensive role, the solid structure contains a series of 13th- century frescos, the oldest of Bornholm's four round churches. History Built around 1165, the church was dedicated to St Nicholas. The old Danish name for Nicolas was Nilaus which has developed into the present name of Nylars. The three storeys are built of fieldstone and with window and door frames of limestone. The original defensive systems are largely intact. The decorated south door is well-preserved. The porch is from 1879.\\"Nylars Kirke\\", Nordens Kirker. Retrieved 19 July 2012. The church first belonged to the Archbishopric of Lund, then came under the Danish crown at the time of the Reformation. In the 19th century, it became fully independent.Otto Norn, C. G. Schultz, Erik Skov, \\"Nylars Kirke: Bornholms N√∏rre Herred\\", Danmarks Kirker, Bornholm, Nationalmuseet, Gad, 1954, pp. 244‚Äì274. Retrieved 5 August 2012. Exterior Nylars Church The three-storey circular structure with a diameter of 11 metres was originally unlimed. The oval-shaped chancel and its apse were constructed at the same time as the nave. Unlike the round churches of √òsterlars and Ols whose masony is supported by buttresses, Nylars is solidly constructed with walls up to 2 metres thick. Originally the church had two doors, one for men and one for women. The northern women's door was first replaced by a window in the 19th century, then completely bricked up in 1973. Measuring only 52 by 27 cm, the small window in the northwest corner behind the stairs up to the gallery is the only completely original Romanesque window in Bornholm's round churches.\\"Kirkebygningens historie\\", Nylars Kirke. Retrieved 5 August 2012. The lower section of the separately-standing bell tower was probably once used as an entrance gate. Remains of the west door can still be seen in the west wall. A niche on the upper floor probably contained a door leading to a staircase as at √òsterlars. The belfry is a later half- timbered addition. There are two bells: the smaller one is from 1702 and bears the stamp of King Frederik IV while the larger bell was cast on Barnholm in 1882. Interior Like the other three round churches on Bornholm, the nave is covered by a ring vault supported by the heavy central pillar built of limestone from Limensgade near Aakirkeby. The apse, lined with limestone flags, has a high half-domed vault in which five holes in the shape of a cross can be seen. They dissimulate clay pots some 20 cm deep which were apparently designed to improve the acoustics. The gallery and pulpit, originally from 1882, were decorated by Poul H√∏m in 1973 in tones reflecting those of the church's frescos. In 1972, H√∏m also completed the little stained-glass window depicting a timeglass located behind the pulpit. In 1882, when the whitewash was removed from the interior, a 13th-century fresco frieze was revealed around the top of the central pillar. On a blue background, typical of the period, it depicts scenes from the Creation and the Last Judgment. The chancel was not used for defence unlike that in √òsterlars. The church font, from the late Romanesque period, is sculpted in Gotland limestone. The baptismal bowl from c. 1575 is from the south of Germany. Depicting a man's profile and the inscription Marcus Tullius Cicero, it was probably first used for affluent banquets. The stained-glass window in the apse, the work of Poul H√∏m, represents the resurrection with a seed developing into a plant. The carpet before the altar, titled Water of Life, is the work of Anne-Lise Kofoed-Hansen (1990).

This includes freedivers, recreational divers including the subcategory technical divers, and professional divers which includes military, commercial, public safety and scientific divers. Depending on the jurisdiction, there will generally be specific published codes of practice and guidelines for training, competence and registration of diving instructors, as they have a duty of care to their clients, and operate in an environment with intrinsic hazards which may be unfamiliar to the lay person. Training and assessment will generally follow adiver training standard. Recreational diving instructors are usually registered members of one or more recreational diver certification agencies, and are generally registered to train and assess divers against specified certification standards. Military diving instructors are generally members of the armed force for which they train personnel. Commercial diving instructors may be required to register with national government appointed organisations, and comply with specific training and assessment standards, but there may be other requirements in some parts of the world. Function Scuba diving education levels as used by ISO, PADI, CMAS, SSI and NAUI A diving instructor trains and assesses the competence of persons who intend to become underwater divers. The instructor may use training standards and materials provided by the certifying organisation, or may develop suitable training standards, depending on the training system and authority involved. Most recreational training and certification agencies provide suitable training materials and require their registered instructors to train and assess using the materials provided. Commercial diving schools may have a broader scope of options, and may be expected to develop and maintain their own training materials, which may be required to comply with a published training standard. History =Commercial= The earliest known diving manual was written by the Deane brothers in 1836. This described the use of the Deane helmet, which was not attached to the suit, and was open to the water at the bottom, and would flood if the diver bent over or fell, but could not cause helmet squeeze. Siebe Gorman produced diving manuals in the 19th century. By 1883 the Siebe Gorman manual was available in Spanish: =Military= =Recreational= In 1953, Jack Atkinson, the first National Diving Officer of the British Sub-Aqua Club, and Colin McLeod started a system of training and accreditation for Third Class, Second Class and First Class Divers, which was based on the three-tier system with which they were familiar, as used for divers in the UK armed forces. This programme was developed over the next six years culminating in the first BSAC Diving Manual, published in 1959. Oscar Gugen, one of BSAC's founders, and George Brookes travelled the UK helping to set up branches of BSAC, all of which used amateur instructors to deliver the BSAC training programme within the club setting. In 1955, Dottie Frazier became the world's first female scuba diving instructor. Dottie Frazier is also recognized as the first female hard-hat diver, first female instructor and the first female to own and operate her own dive shop. Along with diving, Frazier also worked with the United States Navy to design wet suits and dry suits for military and recreational divers. In 1959, The YMCA developed the first nationally organised scuba diving course and certified their first skin and scuba diving instructors in the United States. =Scientific= When a scientific diving operation is part of the duties of the diver as an employee, the operation may be considered a professional diving operation subject to regulation as such. In these cases the training and registration may follow the same requirements as for other professional divers, or may include training standards specifically intended for scientific diving. In other cases, where the divers are in full control of their own diving operation, including planning and safety, diving as volunteers, the occupational health and safety regulations may not apply. Where scientific diving is exempt from commercial diving regulation, training requirements may differ considerably, and in some cases basic scientific diver training and certification may not differ much from entry level recreational diver training. Technological advances have made it possible for scientific divers to accomplish more on a dive, but they have also increased the complexity and the task loading of both the diving equipment and the work done, and consequently require higher levels of training and preparation to safely and effectively use this technology. It is preferable for effective learning and safety that such specialisation training is done systematically and under controlled conditions, rather than on site and on the job. Environmental conditions for training should include exercises in conditions as close as reasonably practicable to field conditions. *Scripps certification cards, AAUS exemption. Training and registration A diving instructor is as a rule required to be qualified as a diver to at least the same level as the divers to be trained. Additional requirements vary. =Professional= South African Department of Labour Class III Diving Instructor registration card Instructors of professional divers are generally required to be qualified as supervisors for the level of diver they can train, and may also be required to have some qualification in adult education as facilitators, assessors or moderators, and to be registered with a governing body. There is usually also a requirement for some experience in the industry before a diver can be trained as a supervisor, and similarly before a supervisor can become an instructor. The actual requirements vary depending on the jurisdiction. In South Africa a commercial diving instructor is registered by the Department of Labour for the class of diving they are considered competent to instruct, and can only instruct learner commercial divers through a commercial diving school, also registered with the Department of Labour. The minimum requirement for registration as a commercial diving instructor include registration and practical experience as a Diving Supervisor of the same class and certification or equivalent work experience as a training facilitator in adult education. For example, the minimum requirement for registration as a Class IV Commercial Scuba Instructor would be: *Pass the practical and theory assessments and other requirements for Class IV Commercial Scuba Diver, including a minimum of 30 dives with a minimum logged time of 15 hours and apply for registration. This is usually a full-time course for about 20 working days. *Have held Class IV Commercial Scuba Diver registration for a minimum of 1 year and 50 logged commercial dives after qualification to qualify for Supervisor training. *Hold in date Level 2 First Aid certification. This is usually a three-day full-time course including assessment. *Hold in date topside or commercial diving certificate of medical fitness issued by a registered Diving Medical Practitioner and registered on the Southern African Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Association (SAUHMA) national database. *Attend and pass the requirements of a Class IV Commercial Scuba Supervisor training programme, which includes about 5 days of theory classwork. The practical requirement of a minimum of 100 hours supervisory experience under the direct supervision of a registered supervisor usually takes several months to complete, but it is possible to do it in a month. After this the school will apply for registration of the applicant as a class IV supervisor. *Have held a Class IV Commercial Scuba Supervisor registration for a minimum of 3 years. *Hold a certification as an adult education training facilitator to a recognised national standard, or equivalent qualification or experience. Minimum 2 days full-time. *Recommendation from the registered commercial diving school at which they are employed. The total time required is more than 4 years, including training and work experience. Similar requirements apply to registration as surface supplied and saturation diving instructors. In each case the applicant must first be qualified and have appropriate work experience as a diver, then supervisor in the class of diving before being eligible for application for registration as an instructor for that class of diving. =Recreational= Recreational diving instructors may be subject to significantly less stringent requirements. These are set by the certification agencies to which they are affiliated, and may also be specifically or generally regulated by health and safety legislation. In the UK the Diving at Work Regulations specifically include training of recreational divers, while in the US and South Africa, the professional diving regulations specifically exclude recreational diving instruction, but in South Africa the work is covered by the general constraints of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993. Diving Instructor Minimum requirements to attend a recreational diving instructor training programme vary between certification agencies. The requirements for PADI Instructor Development Course (IDC) are 6 months as a certified diver, Registration as a PADI Divemaster, with 60 logged dives, a medical statement that the applicant does not suffer from a disqualifying medical condition and recent participation in PADI Emergency First Response training. The IDC takes five to seven days, and comprises two parts, Assistant Instructor training and Open Water Scuba Instructor training. During the IDC the candidate will learn PADI Standards and Procedures, The PADI system of instruction, diver safety and risk management, The role of the diving instructor in the recreational diving industry, and marketing and sales counseling for recreational diving business. 100 logged dives are required before the applicant can take the two-day Instructor Examination. Master Instructor A Master Instructor is a certificate given in recognition of a minimum level of experience in training divers after certification as a Diving Instructor, issued by PADI and SSI. PADI requires a minimum level of experience in a range of instruction activities, attendance at three or more instructor development seminars, a record of adherence to the official PADI training systems, support of the PADI organisation, and a quality assurance record which has been clean for at least six months. It is a prerequisite for application for course director. The SSI rating of Master Instructor is issued in recognition of meeting the required level of experience in training and assessment of recreational scuba divers to SSI standards. No additional training is required. It is a required milestone before application for membership of the SSI Product Review Committee and for admission to an Instructor Trainer program. Legal requirements and duty of care The diving instructor will generally have a duty of care to the learners in training, as well as contractual obligations, some of which may be specified in the training contract. The scope of this duty of care may be stipulated by statutory law, regulations, codes of practice, training standards, training manuals, terms of registration with a training organisation and employment contracts. =Insurance= *Public liability insurance. *Insurance through the certification agency. *Medical insurance. Instructor and staff. Learner divers. *Unemployment insurance. *Compensation for occupational injury and illness. Employment Professional diving schools generally employ instructors specifically as members of the teaching staff. Recreational instructors may be employed as teaching staff, general staff at a dive shop, with teaching duties, or part-time teaching staff. They may also be self-employed, or train club members on a volunteer basis, for which they may be fully or partly remunerated. =Job satisfaction in the recreational diver training industry= In 1995, a study conducted on Queensland, Australia diving instructors showed that positive job satisfaction correlated with intention to remain in the dive industry and still active in their present job for the next 12 months. The same study also showed that wages were still a primary concern since it was first noted by Kessler in 1976.

The battle was also the third of a series of military campaigns against Wei launched by Shu's chancellor, Zhuge Liang. The battle concluded with a Shu victory and capture of Wudu and Yinping commanderies, which are around present-day Longnan, Gansu.  The battle  In the spring of 229, Zhuge Liang ordered Chen Shi to lead troops to attack the Wei-controlled Wudu (Ê≠¶ÈÉΩ; around present-day Cheng County, Gansu) and Yinping (Èô∞Âπ≥; present-day Wen County, Gansu) commanderies,([Âª∫Ëàà]‰∏ÉÂπ¥Ôºå‰∫ÆÈÅ£Èô≥ÊàíÊîªÊ≠¶ÈÉΩ„ÄÅÈô∞Âπ≥„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 35. while he remained at the staging area in Yangping Pass with an army as backup. Upon receiving news that the Wei general Guo Huai had mobilised his forces to attack Chen Shi, Zhuge Liang moved his army from Yangping Pass to Jianwei (Âª∫Â®Å; in present-day Longnan, Gansu) in the northwestern corner of Wudu Commandery.(È≠èÈõçÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤ÈÉ≠Ê∑ÆÁéáË°ÜÊ¨≤ÊìäÊàíÔºå‰∫ÆËá™Âá∫Ëá≥Âª∫Â®ÅÔºå ...) Sanguozhi vol. 35. When Guo Huai heard that Zhuge Liang was heading towards Jianwei, he decided not to attack Chen Shi, and instead ordered his troops to evacuate the area and set up a defensive line in anticipation of further Shu advances. However, Zhuge Liang did not proceed farther after reaching Jianwei, where he deployed his troops to counter any Wei reinforcements that might show up. Guo Huai and his troops retreated later. The Shu forces thus successfully captured Wudu and Yinping commanderies.(... Ê∑ÆÈÄÄÈÇÑÔºåÈÅÇÂπ≥‰∫åÈÉ°„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 35. As the Wei government deemed the two commanderies unimportant, they did not send forces to recapture them from Shu. Since Wei forces had relocated the local tribesmen and livestock away from the two commanderies, Zhuge Liang thought that it would be futile and strategically useless to station troops there to guard them. As a result, he withdrew all Shu forces from the two commanderies and retreated to Hanzhong Commandery.  Aftermath  The victory at Jianwei was short-lived, and the manpower and resources invested in it drained the third Northern Expedition too greatly; for the rest of 229 and for the first part of 230, the Shu forces could do nothing more than construct a defensive line in Hanzhong Commandery in preparation for a Wei offensive towards Hanzhong in the autumn. The diminished Shu forces would launch no further offensives until the fourth expedition in 231. When Zhuge Liang returned from the campaign, the Shu emperor Liu Shan issued an imperial decree to congratulate him on his successes in defeating Wang Shuang during the second Northern Expedition and capturing Wudu and Yinping commanderies during the third Northern Expedition.

It was founded by Anthony Aristar in early 1990 at the University of Western Australia, and is used as a reference by the National Science Foundation in the United States. Its main and oldest feature is the premoderated electronic mailing list, now with thousands of subscribers all over the world, where queries and their summarised results, discussions, journal table of contents, dissertation abstracts, calls for papers, book and conference announcements, software notices and other useful pieces of linguistic information are posted. History Between 1991 and 2013, the service was run by Anthony Aristar and Helen Aristar-Dry. In 1991, it moved from Australia to Texas A&M; University, and Eastern Michigan University was established as the main editing site. By 1994, there were over 5,000 subscribers. From 14 October through 6 November 1996, it held its first on- line conference, Geometric and Thematic Structure in Binding, devoted to the Binding Theory and opened by the keynote address by Howard Lasnik. LINGUIST List moved from Texas A&M; to its own site in 1997. Wayne State University in Michigan was established as the second editing site in 1998, but in 2006 all its operations moved to nearby Eastern Michigan University. In 2013, Aristar- Dry and Aristar retired from Eastern Michigan University and Damir Cavar became the moderator and director of operations. In 2014 Malgorzata E. Cavar became the second moderator.

Legend has it that the creator ( Prajapathi ) had 3 sons. Namely men, demons and gods. After Prajapathi taught them their lessons as a father, the three groups of students approached Prajapathi and asked for one final lesson. When the gods approached him and asked for their lesson, he said the word \\"da\\" and asked them whether they understood. They said, yes, you have asked us to control our self and the \\"da\\" means \\"damyatham\\" or self restraint. Similarly he said the same word \\"da\\" when the other two groups approached him as well. The men understood \\"da\\" as \\"datta\\" which means being charitable and the demons understood \\"da\\" as \\"dayadhwam\\" which meant being kind. At this point a thundering sound was heard from the heavens that said \\"da da da, damaytha datta dayadhwam\\" which suggested the three axioms everyone of us should learn. http://www.karnatik.com/c1438.shtml Maithreem Bhajata is a song that tells us how we should all live our lives, in the short span we have, called life.

Vienna: K. u. k. Staatsdruckerei. The German name Neulagb√ºchl (literally, 'Neulag hill') can be found in older sources. History Deleƒçi Vrh was a Gottschee German village. It was not mentioned in the land registry of 1574 or in the 1770 census, and was probably originally an isolated farmstead. The settlement may have been founded around 1580 by Countess Magdalena Blagay and her son Georg. In the cadastral registry of 1825 the settlement had three houses. In 1880 it had a population of 16 people living in two houses, but by 1931 this had declined to a population of two. It was already abandoned before the Second World War, and all that remained was a hunting lodge belonging to the Auersperg noble family. A forestry official working for the Auerspergs lived in the lodge, which had a telephone connection to Soteska Castle.Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937. Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 470. From June to August 1942 the hunting lodge housed a Partisan hospital. The building was burned by Italian troops in the summer of 1942 during the Rog Offensive after the Partisans had evacuated it. After the war the Podturn Forestry Works () built a cabin at the site used part of the year by forestry workers. In recent years, the building has been made available for rental and is also used for organized vacations for children and young people. The Jelendol Partisan Hospital was located in a gulch 1 km south of Deleƒçi Vrh.Jelendol Partisan Hospital on Geopedia Remains of the hospital include a patients' barracks maintained by the Partisan Veterans Organization and a nearby cemetery for the wounded.

They were basically a 4-4-0 version of the WAGR's 4-6-0 G class, and identical to the South Australian Railways Z class, save for a bogie tender in place of the SAR six wheel tender. They entered service on the Eastern Goldfields Railway with P63 hauling the inaugural service from Coolgardie to Kalgoorlie in September 1896. Both were sold in 1912 to the MRWA, however they were underpowered and after the delivery of its five new C class locomotives, were relegated to shunting duties at Midland Junction. In 1913, P62 commenced a 12-month lease to the Public Works Department. When it returned it was withdrawn and became a parts source for P63 which had been renumbered P12.

In a racing career which lasted from June 2005 and October 2007 she ran seventeen times and won four races. As a two-year-old, she won two of her six races including an upset win in the Group Two Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. As a three-year-old she won the Nell Gwyn Stakes and then took the Classic 1000 Guineas for her trainer and part owner Pam Sly. She failed to win in nine subsequent races although she placed second in the Earl of Sefton Stakes and the Pretty Polly Stakes. She was retired at the end of the 2007 season to become a broodmare. Her front-running style and unconventional background made her a popular Classic winner. Background Speciosa, a bay horse with a white blaze and two white socks, was bred in Ireland by Kevin and Meta Cullen. She was large, heavily built mare, standing 16.2 hands high as a three-year-old. Her dam, Specifically, a daughter of the Canadian champion Sky Classic won one minor race and has produced several other winners including Major Rhythm, a gelding who won the Stars and Stripes Handicap in 2006. Specifically was closely related to Touching Wood, a colt finished second in The Derby and won the St Leger in 1982. Speciosa was sired by Danehill Dancer, a stallion whose progeny have won (as of 2012), more than 700 races and more than ¬£13m in prize money. In April 2005 the two-year-old Speciosa was offered for sale at Doncaster where she was bought for 30,000 guineas by Pam Sly. At the time, Sly trained fewer than twenty horses at her farm at Thorney, near Peterborough in Cambridgeshire. She was mainly known for training jumpers and until Speciosa arrived, she had never had a runner in a Group race. Pam Sly owned the filly in partnership with her son Michael and the London-based G. P. Tom Davies. Shortly after buying Speciosa, Sly engaged the Limerick-born jockey Michael \\"Micky\\" Fenton to ride her in a training gallop. According to Fenton, who has been described as a \\"journeyman jockey\\", the filly \\"flew down the gallops\\" and he became her regular partner, riding her in fourteen of her seventeen races. Speciosa was a highly nervous and temperamental filly: in her early career she was treated with magnesium in an attempt to calm her temperament. Racing career Speciosa began her career by running in maiden races at minor tracks in the summer of 2005. She finished second on her debut at Ripon in June, eighth at Nottingham in July and third at Leicester in August. She was successful at her fourth attempt, winning a maiden at Beverley Racecourse by a head despite veering to the left in the closing stages. Despite the modest standard of her form, Speciosa was then moved up in class to contest the Group Two May Hill Stakes at Doncaster in September. The 50/1 outsider of the eight runners, she took an early lead which she held until the final furlong before finishing third to Nasheej. Five weeks later, she started at odds of 20/1 in the Group Two Rockfel Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket. Fenton sent the filly to the front from the start, and she maintained her lead to the finish, winning by a neck from Violette with the future Sun Chariot Stakes winner Spinning Queen in sixth. During the winter of 2005/2006, Speciosa's owners turned down several large offers to buy the filly: Pam Sly was over-ruled by her partners after advising them to accept a ¬£1,000,000 bid. Speciosa began her three-year-old season in the Nell Gwyn Stakes a trial race for the 1000 Guineas run at Newmarket in April, in which, as a previous Group race winner, she carried a three pounds weight penalty. She led throughout the race and prevailed by a length from Spinning Queen, although she again showed a tendency to hang left inside the final furlong. Nineteen days later, Speciosa was the 10/1 fourth choice in the betting for the 1000 Guineas, behind Rumplestiltskin, Nannina and Flashy Wings. On Newmarket's wide Rowley Mile course, the field of thirteen runners split into two groups, with Speciosa taking the lead of the larger group racing nearest the stands. In the final quarter mile, many of the runners began to tire on the soft ground, but Speciosa stayed on under pressure, and although she yet again drifted to the left, she won by two lengths from Confidential Lady with Nasheej in third. Speciosa's victory was enthusiastically received by the Newmarket crowd, who gave the filly and her connections three cheers. Pam Sly described the win as being \\"for all the little people\\" and the success of a small stable was contrasted with those achieved by the major international racing organisations such as Coolmore/Ballydoyle and Godolphin. Pam Sly paid a ¬£20,000 supplementary fee to run Speciosa in The Oaks a month later, as the filly had not been one of the original entries for the mile and a half race. Starting at odds of 5/1, Speciosa led until the final quarter mile before being overtaken and finishing fourth to the Irish-trained filly Alexandrova. Her two remaining race results of 2006 were a ninth to Nasheej in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and a sixth in the Group Two Park Stakes at Doncaster in September. Speciosa remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to win in six races. She began her season by racing against colts in the Earl of Sefton Stakes and produced a promising performance to finish second to the 2007 World Champion Manduro. Her only other placing came in June, when she was runner-up to Peeping Fawn in the Group One Pretty Polly Stakes. She finished unplaced in the Lockinge Stakes, the Nassau Stakes and the Sun Chariot Stakes, all Group One events. On her final appearance, she led for the first six furlongs of the Champion Stakes at Newmarket, before finishing seventh of the twelve runners behind Literato. Stud record Speciosa's first foal, a colt by Oasis Dream Vermuyden, was foaled in March 2009.

It was adapted from Potter's novel of the same name. Premise and initial broadcast Broadcast as four 50-minute episodes, first screened weekly from 29 November 1989 to 20 December 1989 on Britain's BBC2 channel,British FIlm Institute SIFT database. Blackeyes starred Gina Bellman as the title character, an attractive model, with Michael Gough in a key role as her uncle. Potter described the series' theme as the objectification of \\"young and attractive women as consumer goods in a way that brutalizes both sexes\\".Graham Fuller, Dennis Potter (interview), American Film, March 1989, p.55. Production Following the successes of The Singing Detective and Christabel, the BBC awarded a budget of ¬£2.4 million to the production of Blackeyes. It was shot on 35 mm film and took 18 months to complete.Graham Fuller, Potter on Potter, Faber and Faber 1993, p.125. Despite illness, Potter opted to direct the series, the only time he did this for TV. He had considered both Jon Amiel and Nicolas Roeg, both recent collaborators, for the job. He would consider it a mistake to direct the serial himself. In 2007 an article in The Guardian written by Jon Wilde revealed that the journalist had been the inspiration for the character of Mark Wilsher, \\"an insufferably smug hack\\" in episode 2.

I became convinced that Potter was guilty of the crime he was condemning\\".Sunday Times 26 November 1989 Reception =Initial responses= Following transmission, favourable comments were offered by the reviewers of several broadsheets. Mark Lawson applauded Potter's willingness to take risks, comparing him to novelist Martin Amis, while Christopher Tookey linked Potter to August Strindberg and Jonathan Swift and described Blackeyes as possibly \\"the most interesting, original and honest work he's done since Pennies from Heaven\\".Independent 30 November 1989Daily Telegraph 30 November 1989 The majority of the British press reacted negatively to the series, many highlighting the amount of sex and nudity as cause for complaint. The Sunday Express called it \\"the world's most complicated porn film\\" fit for \\"the wastebin\\", the Sunday Times reasserted its antipathy to Blackeyes at the series' conclusion, summing it up as \\"Porno Twaddle\\".Sunday Express 3 December 1989Sunday Times 24 December 1989 The series was also attacked for being \\"a load of old cobblers!\\" in The Sun and \\"immensely boring\\" in the Daily Telegraph.The Sun 30 November 1989Daily Telegraph 7 December 1989 Blackeyes was the subject of mocking cartoons in several tabloids, again focusing on the nudity.

The couple are being interrupted by campaigner Mary Whitehouse who is waving her fist at the writer and exclaiming, \\"Potter! I'll give you flamin' Blackeyes!\\"Griffin's Eye, Daily Mirror, 30 November 1989 (reproduced in Dennis Potter - A Biography by Humphrey Carpenter, Faber and Faber 1998, image no. 36) The Daily Star presented an image of a BBC Drama department office in which all the staff were going about their business either naked or in underwear. A bank of TV screens show titles such as 'Brown Eyes', 'Square Eyes' and 'Slant Eyes' while another reads 'Blackeyes - Get em off'. A man dressed in black lingerie is sitting beside bundles of letters labelled 'Complaints' and speaking into a phone saying, \\"OK, so a girl walks about half-naked - is that so unusual?\\".Bill Caldwell, Daily Star, 1 December 1989, reproduced No stranger to controversy, Potter was stunned by the level of press hostility and was particularly saddened at the way he was labelled with nicknames such as \\"Dirty Den\\" and \\"Television's Mr Filth\\".Interview with Gina Bellman, quoted in Dennis Potter - A Biography by Humphrey Carpenter, Faber and Faber 1998, p.504Interview with Martina Devlin, Edingburgh Evening News, 10 February 1990 He described himself as being \\"in the pit of a real depression\\" and upset by the personal comments made about him in City Limits and Time Out.Independent 21 December 1989 In a Radio 2 interview he suggested his writing career might be at an end.Dennis Potter interview on The John Dunn Show, BBC Radio 2, 13 December 1989 The criticisms also enabled Potter to speak directly about his own experience of child-abuse, which he had attempted to address in Blackeyes, an element of the series that had seemingly been overlooked by its critics: \\"If you listen to the voice-over [in the last episode] you'll see it's very clear why [child-abuse] strikes my heart. I've never been able to speak directly about it - no one who's had such an experience has ever been able to speak about it except obliquely. It sits there and makes me sweat even now\\".Independent 21 December 1989 The Sunday Telegraph acknowledged Potter's childhood experience as \\"the source of the harrowing scene in the last episode\\".Sunday Telegraph 31 December 1989 The sequence involves the character of Maurice Kingsley about to sexually abuse his niece Jessica until Potter's voice-over interrupts: \\"No, you'll have to imagine the rest if you must... the snake in his hand has become the worm in her soul. Recollections of abuse - my god - they're hard to deal with - even though I try... There are times when the pen in your hand becomes... becomes - yes - a knife in someone else's\\". =Later reactions= In 1993 Potter summed up the initial press reaction to Blackeyes by calling it \\"a tide of polemical abuse of such huge proportions in the English tabloids that it was almost proof I was stepping on the right nerves, if not totally in the right way\\".Quoted in Graham Fuller, Potter on Potter, Faber and Faber 1993, p.133. A few years' removed from the project he admitted responsibility for some of the negative reaction, saying, \\"there were too many strands, and the style, which is very alienating, it was so successful it alienated every fucking person who ever saw it!\\" and \\"I did fail. If there's such universal rejection and opposition and incomprehension then it's extremely likely that it was either badly written, or badly done, or both.\\"Quoted in Graham Fuller, Potter on Potter, Faber and Faber 1993, p.132.Quoted in Graham Fuller, Potter on Potter, Faber and Faber 1993, p.134. =Critical analysis= Graham Fuller describes Blackeyes as \\"a complex analysis of institutionalized sexism\\" and an \\"abstruse but in many ways extremely courageous post-feminist revenge thriller\\" in his 1993 book Potter on Potter, a collection of interviews with the writer. Acknowledging the original press reaction, he describes the series as being \\"condemned for feeding the very sickness it claimed to be diagnosing\\" and defends Potter by asserting that the programme's explicit scenes were \\"unintended to be titillating to viewers who would elect to see them that way\\".Graham Fuller, Potter on Potter, Faber and Faber 1993, p.126. Twenty years later Fuller continues to challenge the tabloid view of Blackeyes in Sight & Sound, \\"Advertising is the arena in which Blackeyes throws herself to the lions...auditioning in a bikini for salivating ad executives...[the scene is] intercut with fragmented moments from the history of Jessica Kingsley...as a sexual-abuse victim who eventually drowns herself - how could Potter not have been taken seriously?\\"Graham Fuller, Angels and Devils: The Dark Dreams of Dennis Potter, Sight & Sound Magazine, July 2014, p.41. Sergio Angelini calls Blackeyes \\"a deliberately uncomfortable, humorous, densely imagined, frequently powerful if imperfect work, one that practically vanished after its original airing but which, now that its shock value has long been superseded, needs to be re-assessed by a new generation\\". It was repeated multiple times on the now-defunct channels UK Drama and UK Arena in the late 90s and early 00s but remains unreleased on DVD or Blu-ray.

He served as a commissioner of education and examinations in Guangdong Province.Qian Daxin - Famous Versatile Scholar of the Qing Dynasty. Culture China. Retrieved 31 August 2012. As the proponent of kaozheng approach, Qian Daxin criticized moralizing (\\"praise and blame\\") interpretations of the Spring and Autumn Annals and argued that the importance of history should be deemed as valid as importance of classics. The diplomat Qian Qichen, who served as China's Foreign Minister and Vice Premier, was a descendant of Qian Daxin.  Life  Qian Daxin was born in 1728, the 6th year of the Yongzheng reign. Qian Daxin started to teach in a very young age. He was first teaching in Gu's ÔºàÈ°æÔºâ family's home, and he was able to get into the Gu's family library. The Gu's family library is where Qian studied the classics and histories. He died in 1806, during the 9th year of the Jiaqing reign. During his early life Daxin achieved fame in the Southern area of the Yangtze River for his poetry and prose, which prompted the Qianlong emperor to grant Qian Daxin the title of \\"First-Degree Scholars (‰∏æ‰∫∫)\\" and give him a job as the Secretary of the Cabinet (ÂÜÖÈòÅ‰∏≠‰π¶) in the 16th year of Qianlong reign. In the 19th year of the Qianlong dynasty, Qian Daxin took the imperial examination, was rewarded with a degree as an Imperial scholar (ÁßÄÊâç), and was appointed as a member of the Hanlin Academy, which revised, edited, and criticized literary and history files.

Qian Daxin was one of the well informed men or his time focusing on western astronomy and mathematics. Qian Daxin and Dai Zhen applied mathematics and using the ancient relics to convert ancient texts. They built a way for a cumulative field of investigation that came to a climax in 19th and 20th century breakthrough in the application of epigraphy and archaeology to research on the oracle bones. During Qian Daxin's lifetime, to some people, he was seen as a profound and specialized Academic Master. Scholars like Wang Chang (ÁéãÊò∂)ÔºåDuan Yucai, Wang Yinzhi, Ling Tingkan (ÂáåÂª∑Â†™), Ruan Yuan, and Jiang Fan (Ê±üËó©) rated him highly.

From the place name it has been suggested that the craftsmen were not only artificers in brass and iron, but also handlers of the harp and probably players of the bagpipes. In the Statistical Account of Stevenston parish by the minister Dr Wodrow, published in 1791, the village is stated to have been composed of between fourteen and sixteen houses, standing about a quarter of a mile east of Stevenston. Blaeu's map of 1654, based on Timothy Pont's map of circa 1600 clearly indicates Pyperhauck (sic) without Stevenston even being recorded. A place named 'Pypermuck' is shown near Saltcoats.Blaeu's Map Retrieved : 2012-08-16 The 1856 OS map records the Site of the village of Piperheugh between the copse at the 'Y' road junction and the Woodhead Plantation.OS Map Retrieved : 2012-08-05 A heugh or heuch in Scots is a dell or a steep bank, especially one bordering a river or the sea. In this context it is worth noting the River Garnock used to run along a route that included a section through nearby Dubbs and below Ardeer House; Ardeer sand dunes being effectively an island at that time.Love, Page 46 =The abandonment of Piperheugh= The area upon which the village once stood is now partly developed and the Piperheugh Plantation has been felled. It is not clear what led to its abandonment, leading to the suggestion that Piperheugh was essentially an artisan encampment of gypsies or tinkers rather than a village of permanent dwellings, although it was significant enough to appear on Blaeu's map in the 17th century. Ardeer House (demolished 1968) and estate owned the land on which the hamlet stood and this would have had a bearing on the fate of the settlement. Robin Campbell states that the 'Piper's Haugh' was \\"Swallowed up in the sands of Ardeer.\\"Service, Page 257 Such a suggestion is possible when it is looked at in the context of dry summers, such as that of 1826, when the wind blown sands from Ardeer caused havoc for miles inland.Clements, Page 76 Trumps A trump or Jew's harp (c. 1860s). The Jew's harp was called a 'trump' in Scots, also referred to as the tongue of the trump.Scots Dictionary Retrieved : 2012-08-04 It is not known why the village had the apparent monopoly of the 'trumps' trade, however other examples exist, such as Stewarton for Scots bonnets, Colinsburgh for corkscrews, and Culross for girdles. The Jew‚Äôs harp was one of the most popular and cheap musical instruments and records show that hundreds of thousands were imported from at least the 15th century. It was thought that manufacturing of the instrument in the UK did not start until the Industrial Revolution, when it was centred on Dudley in the West Midlands. Piperheugh may be unique as the only known pre-Industrial Revolution Jew‚Äôs harp manufactory. Dr Landsborough in 1837 wrote that although the hamlet was in ruins, the spirit of the pipers and harpers lived on in the fondness that the people of Stevenston had for music.Wallace, Page 10 Coal mining A relatively thin dislocation, gall or dyke is present in the coal strata in the area and is known as the Piperheugh Gall or Step, running in a south westerly direction from Ardeer Mains Farm towards the River Garnock; in 1798 this is recorded as the 'Piper Hugh Step'.Photobucket Retrieved : 2013-04-23 The other dislocation is the Caponcraig Gall which is about 20 yards thick.Wallace, Page 28 The coal seams here were known as the \\"West Field\\" of Stevenston Colliery.

The swing bridge is the 11th bridge from the river's mouth at Newark Bay and is upstream from it. Opened in 1903, it is owned and operated by New Jersey Transit. History Approach to bridge from Newark Broad Street with Stickel Bridge in the background Rail service across the river was generally oriented to bringing passengers and freight from the points west over the Hackensack Meadows to Bergen Hill, where tunnels and cuts provided access to terminals on the Hudson River. In 1836, the Morris and Essex Railroad established a right- of-way from the west at Orange to Newark, from where it used the New Jersey Rail Road at Centre Street to cross the river and travel east to its terminal at Paulus Hook on the waterfront in Jersey City. By1855 it built its own bridge across the Passaic. By the early 1860s, the railroad had established the alignment across the Kearny Meadows and began using the Long Dock Tunnel to Hoboken. In the early 1900s railroad elevated the line approaching the river which previously ran at grade along Division Street in Newark and built the current bridge. Completed in an earlier phase, the bridge was later shifted upstream on the new alignment. In 1945, the Morris and Essex Railroad officially merged into the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. DL&W; merged with the Erie Railroad in 1960 to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, which was absorbed by Conrail in 1976; New Jersey Transit has operated all passenger service since 1983. Operations The lower of the long Passaic River downstream of the Dundee Dam is tidally influenced and navigable, but due to the limited maritime traffic the bridge is infrequently required to open. Since 1998 rules regulating drawbridge operations require a 24-hour notice. The bridge at milepost 7.48 is used exclusively by New Jersey Transit rail operations for the Montclair-Boonton Line and both branches of the Morris and Essex Lines, the Morristown Line and the Gladstone Branch. It is situated just east of Newark Broad Street Station, the first stop after the lines travelling west from Hoboken Terminal and Secaucus Junction converge. In 2004, NJT contracted a study to determine the condition of the bridge and to begin long-term planning for its future replacement. In 2009-2010, the bridge underwent $23 million project for maintenance and repairs, funded by the agency.http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/Jan%2017%202008.pdf and performed by Skanskahttp://www.usa.skanska.com/Global/brochure/coasttocoast/Finals/C2C_10_no2.pdf See also *Lower Hack Lift *Bergen Tunnels *Timeline of Jersey City area railroads *List of crossings of the Lower Passaic River *List of bridges, tunnels, and cuts in Hudson County, New Jersey *NJT movable bridges  References  External links *Image of Newark Draw *Bridgehunter *image Category:Bridges completed in 1903 Category:Bridges in Newark, New Jersey Category:Bridges in Hudson County, New Jersey Category:Railroad bridges in New Jersey Category:Swing bridges in the United States Category:Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad bridges Category:NJ Transit bridges Category:Bridges over the Passaic River Category:Steel bridges in the United States Category:1903 establishments in New Jersey ","title":"Newark Drawbridge"},{"id":"36638740","text":"Talal Al-Rashidi (born 24 July 1993) is a Kuwaiti professional target shooter.

The four presenters are George McGavin, Steve Backshall, Justine Evans, and Gordon Buchanan. The series is a production of the BBC Natural History Unit, and was premiered on 30 July and ended on 13 August 2008. It has three episodes, each 58 minutes long. The series received a Science and Natural History reward from the Royal Television Society. Guyana is a country located in South America, bordering Suriname, Brazil, and Venezuela. The country is known for its large, unspoiled rainforest, which is home to a wide range of animals, including the jaguar. The series documents the crew's journey through the rainforest, where they encounter the unique fauna of the region. BBC promoted Guyana as \\"the land of giants\\" inhabited by \\"the huge anaconda, the world's largest tarantula and giant otters.\\" The series was originally named Expedition Guyana, but the title was changed to the Lost Land of the Jaguar by the BBC to appeal to a wider audience, as a reference to Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World. Lost Land of the Jaguar is the second series in the BBC's \\"Expedition\\" collection, preceding Lost Land of the Volcano in 2009 and Lost Land of the Tiger in 2011 and following Expedition Borneo in 2006. Reception Tim Walker of The Independent criticized the series for prosaic commentary and a lack of \\"spectacle.\\" Walker praised the performance of the presenters, but wrote that despite the noble aims of the series in promoting rainforest conservation, \\"it doesn't always make for compelling television.\\" Vicky Baker of The Guardian considered the title of the series misleading. She wrote that Guyana is not a lost land, but a \\"forgotten\\" or \\"ignored\\" one, \\"amazingly, considering it was known as British Guiana up until 1966.\\" The Guardian's Gareth McLean was more positive on the series, writing that it was a \\"captivating series from the BBC's Natural History Unit,\\" despite the department's funding cuts.

The organ was rebuilt several times, including by expanding the scope of manual and pedal, new intonation, installing electro bag store, supplementing the planning, expansion to a third plant. From the original organ-Glis today the baroque enclosures are available, which was designed by the sculptor Anthony Merz, and three registers. Six registers from the years 1910 and 1919 (GF Steinmeyer & Co. Oettingen). The present organ was created in 2004 and 2005 by the organ builder Goll (Lucerne / Switzerland), historical re-using existing structures. The instrument has 45 stops and three transmissions on three manuals and pedal. The disposition was created based on the Franco-baroque sound of Glis-organs. The Spieltrakturen are mechanical.

You can never find a final cause, since you must always ask one question more: \\"What caused that cause?\\" You can never find any ultimate goal, since you're always obliged to ask, \\"Then what purpose does that serve?\\" Whenever you find out why something is good-or is true-you still have to ask what makes that reason good and true. No matter what you discover, at every step, these kinds of questions will always remain, because you have to challenge every answer with, \\"Why should I accept that answer?\\" Such circularities can only waste our time by forcing us to repeat, over and over and over again, \\"What good is Good?\\" and, \\"What god made God?\\" \\" Marvin Minsky.

Background  Persian (Iranian) music had been merely handed down orally from one generation to the other, and Abjad system of notation was only been used in musical theories, not for the practical use. Modern staff notation entered to Iran about 1850AD. After that, some of Iranian musicians efforted to write the radif of Persian music using this method. Among those musicians, two of them managed to write a comprehensive notation. The first one was Alinaghi Vaziri, but his recordings have been lost.

Together with Srednja Bukova Gora and Spodnja Bukova Gora, it was merged into the settlement of Bukova Gora in 1955.\\"Preimovanje, dopolnitve in popravki nekaterih krajevnih imen.\\" 1955.

One of the first of its kind, it flew safely but generated little customer interest, and only five were produced. Design and development Waldo Waterman's first flying wing aircraft was the unofficially named Waterman Whatsit, a pusher configuration low swept-wing monoplane with fins near its wing tips. The Whatsit also featured a wing-mounted tricycle undercarriage and a trim foreplane. Powered by a 100 hp (75 kW) Kinner K-5 5-cylinder radial pusher engine, it first flew in 1932. In May 1935 Waterman completed a submission to the government funded Vidal Safety Airplane competition. This was the Arrowplane, sometimes known as the W-4. This adopted a similar layout to the Whatsit but had a strut-braced high wing on a blunt-nosed, narrow fuselage pod with a tricycle undercarriage mounted under it. Its wings had wooden spars and metal ribs and were fabric covered, with triangular endplate fins carrying upright rudders. Its fuselage was steel framed and aluminium covered. It was powered by a 95 hp (71 kW) inverted inline 4-cylinder Menasco B-4 Pirate pusher engine mounted high in the rear of the fuselage. The Arrowplane was not intended for production or to be roadable, but its success in the Vidal competition encouraged Waterman to form the Waterman Arrowplane Co. in 1935 for production of a roadable version. The resulting Arrowbile, referred to by Waterman as the W-5, was similar both structurally and aerodynamically to the Arrowplane, though the fins differed in shape, with rounded leading edges and swept-back rudder hinges. For road use the wings and propeller could be quickly detached. The main other differences were in engine choice, the need to drive the wheels and to use conventional car floor-type controls on the road. The air-cooled Menasco was replaced by a water-cooled engine as used by most cars. Waterman modified a 6-cylinder upright, 100 hp (75 kW) Studebaker unit and placed it lower down in the pod, driving the propeller shaft at the top of the fuselage via six ganged V-belts with a 1.94:1 speed reduction. The radiator was in the forward fuselage, fed from a duct opening in the extreme upper nose. On the ground the engine drove the main wheels through a differential gear, as normal, and the car was steered by its nosewheel. The wheels were enclosed in fairings, initially as a road safety measure. Instead of removing the propeller for the road, it could be de-clutched to prevent it windmilling the engine at speed. The wheel in the two-seat cabin controlled the Arrowbile both on the road and in the air. Outer wing elevons moved together to alter pitch and differentially to bank. The rudders, interconnected with the elevons when the wheel was turned, moved only outwards, so in a turn only the inner rudder was used, both adjusting yaw as normal and assisting the elevon in depressing the inner wing tip. This system had been used on the Arrowplane as a safety feature to avoid the commonly fatal spin out of climb and turn from take-off accident but the raked rudder hinge of the Arrowbile provided the banking component even from a nose-down attitude. There were no conventional flaps or wing mounted airbrakes but the rudders could be operated as brakes by opening them outwards together with a control independent of the wheel. The cabin interior was designed to motor car standards, with easy access and a baggage space under the seats. The Arrowbile first flew on 21 February 1937, making it a close contemporary of the Gwinn Aircar, and a second prototype with a number of minor modifications followed. Studebaker were interested in the Arrowbile because of the use of their engine and ordered five. The third Arrowbile was the first of this order. However, there was little market response and the line was halted in 1938, with no more production aircraft completed. The production aircraft had several changes, some of which aimed to emphasise the similarities with cars; there was a radiator grille with a single headlight centrally above it and also car type doors and petrol filler cap. The fourth Aerobile was completed as a conventional, non-roadable aircraft; Waterman initially retained the Studebaker engine but in 1941 replaced it with an air-cooled Franklin. In 1943 he modified the wings with slotted flaps and later still replaced the braced wing with a cantilever one, using the wing from the unbuilt fifth aircraft. The last, sixth aircraft was not completed and flown until May 1957. It was a three-seat, roadable version powered by a water-cooled Tucker-Franklin. This was cooled by radiators on each side of the engine, fed air by fuselage side scoops. In the absence of the forward radiator the nose was remodelled, becoming shorter and blunter. The fins were also altered so that the upper and lower leading edges met at an acute angle. At some point this particular Arrowbile was renamed the Aerobile, though it was not a name that Waterman used. Operational history In early September 1937 the first three Arrowbiles flew from the factory at Santa Monica to the National Air Races venue at Cleveland, a great circle distance of about . The first force landed en route, but the other two reached the races and gave demonstration flights.

Anchored by Left Tackle Dave Reavis, Super Bowl winning lineman from the Pittsburgh Steelers, and Horton at Left Guard, the line blocked the Buccaneers offense into history. Only Right Tackle Charlie Hannah missed any time, not able to play the final two games of the regular season and first playoff game.

He was named to the Chicago Tribune Super 22 All-star team and was invited to play in the state high school All-star contest. College career Scott accepted a football scholarship from the University of Colorado during a low point in the school history, where his teams never had a winning record and he was usually recognized as the most talented player of the defense. He was a four-year starter (43 out 44 games) at cornerback, that also excelled on special teams. As a junior, he led the team in interceptions with 4, including 2 returned for touchdowns. Against Oklahoma State University, he intercepted 3 passes, returning 2 for touchdowns of 30 and 25 yards. As senior, he had 4 interceptions, returning one for a 71-yard touchdown against Kansas State University. He was named All-Big Eight in 1982 and 1983. He received second-team All-American honors in 1983, and played in the Hula Bowl and the Senior Bowl.

As a rookie, he won the nickelback role and played on special teams. His diving, fourth-quarter interception in the eleventh game against the St. Louis Cardinals, set up the game's winning touchdown. The next season, he had a chance to start 3 games at right cornerback in place of an injured Ron Fellows. In the fifteenth game of the season against the New York Giants, he helped the Cowboys clinch the NFC East Championship when he intercepted a Phil Simms pass with 46 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. He also had 3 sacks, 2 interceptions (one returned for a touchdown), 7 passes defensed and one forced fumble. In 1986, he was voted the special teams captain, but had an injury plagued season, playing in only 5 games after having early problems with a preseason hamstring injury and breaking his wrist in the fifth game against the Denver Broncos. He returned to play in the last game of the season. In 1987, he strained a chest muscle that limited him in the preseason. He played in only 6 games, after refusing to take a drug test and being placed on the reserve-non football illness list for personal reasons on October 29. In the final 3 games he made 9 tackles, defended 3 passes and recovered a fumble. In 1988, he only played in 2 games, after suffering an ankle injury and being placed on the injured reserve list. He also was suspended by the league for testing positive for Cocaine. In 1990, after being out of football for one year, the Cowboys gave him a chance to make the team, but he was released before the season started. =Orlando Predators (AFL)= Scott signed with the Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League for the 1991 season, where he played as a Wide Receiver/Linebacker. =San Antonio Force (AFL)= In 1992, he played for the San Antonio Force as a Wide Receiver/Linebacker. =Massachusetts Marauders (AFL)= Scott signed with the Massachusetts Marauders for the 1994 season, playing as a Wide Receiver/Linebacker.

Arrested in October 2004, in December 2010 she was sentenced by French courts to 20 years in prison. Early life When Iparraguirre was a child, her family ran safe houses for ETA. As a teenager in the late 1970s, she joined the Vizcaya unit of ETA, working mainly as a courier for the group. When Iparraguirre was 20, police raided her family home and found of dynamite brought from France. During the operation her boyfriend Jos√© Manuel Aristimu√±o, alias \\"Pana\\", was killed, while her father fled to France. At the time, she was studying to become a teacher. Though arrested by police during this operation, she was released and fled to France. After her lover's death she became more actively involved in ETA, going on to become one of its \\"bloodiest\\" members. 1980s After a year of ETA training in France, she recrossed the border in 1985 as a member of the Araba commando unit. In her first action, in March 1985, she is said to have attacked police and a television crew with a machine gun near a sports centre in Vitoria-Gasteiz. Active alongside Jos√© Javier Arizcuren, Juan Carlos Arruti, and Eusebio Arzalluz, in the three years to 1987 she is believed by the police to have been involved in six killings in the Basque country, of postman Estanislao Gal√≠ndez, civil guardsman Fernando Amo, and police officers F√©lix Gallego, Manuel Fuentes, Antonio Ligero, and Rafael Mircientes. After the destruction of her cell in a gun fight on the border, she crossed back into France. 1990s Iparraguirre is understood to have joined ETA's Madrid commando unit in the early 1990s and documents discovered by police in 1992 suggest that she was in charge of ETA's \\"legal commandos\\" (i.e. those without police records). Police sources of the time describe her as \\"elegant and good looking\\", noting also that she frequented \\"the trendy spots of the capital in fine clothing\\". In 1992 she narrowly escaped arrest, fleeing to France where she abandoned guns and a car bomb. She is believed to have been involved in eight further killings within the space of two years, namely, of second lieutenant Miguel Mirando, and of seven members of the Spanish Armed Forces in a car bombing in Madrid. After 1993, with her wanted poster prominent on public buildings, she lived and operated from France. According to the subsequent testimony of ETA prisoners, in this period she was involved in the recruitment, training and indoctrination of new members, setting their objectives and providing weapons and money. She is also thought to have been involved in the attempted assassination of King Juan Carlos in 1997. ETA leadership role In 2000 she became the only female member of ETA's central committee, the second to hold such a position, and one of four people in charge of ETA's military operations. At the same time her lover was in charge of the political wing. Security agents of the Ministry of the Interior believe she was a leading contender to assume overall leadership of ETA in September that year, after the arrest of Ignacio Gracia Arregui, Inaki de Renteria. In February 2002, at the request of the Spanish government, Iparraguirre was one of 21 people with connections to ETA added to the US Treasury's list of terrorist financiers. She was accused of being responsible for the collection of ETA's \\"revolutionary tax\\", used to fund the group. Arrest, trial and imprisonment Iparraguirre was arrested by police in Salies-de-B√©arn near Pau in south-west France in a police operation on 3 October 2004. She was arrested together with her partner Mikel Albizu Iriarte, known as \\"Antza\\", and their child. Although they were in possession of false papers and refused to answer questions, police were able to identify the pair by examining their fingerprints. The operation led to the arrest of twenty ETA members, captured in a series of seven raids which also permitted the seizure of a large cache of weapons, which included of explosives, grenade launchers, and two Russian made SAM-7 surface-to-air missiles. At the time of her arrest, Iparraguirre was wanted by Spanish police for her involvement in at least 14 killings. On 16 December 2010, French courts sentenced both to 20 years in prison for directing and financing terrorism; after serving their sentences, they will be deported to Spain. In April 2012, the ETA prisoners' association EPPK, endorsing a peaceful negotiated settlement to the Basque conflict, nominated Iparraguirrea, together with her partner Antza, as two of the six prisoners delegated to represent the organization in any future negotiations which might possibly take place between ETA and the governments of Spain and France.

Along with his colleague, Sir Alfred Fripp, he had been knighted in 1903 for service to the Reform Committee of the Royal Army Medical Corps - including the setting-up of the Royal Army Medical College at Millbank, London. From 1900-1905 he was a member of the Senate of the University of London representing of the faculty of medicine. He served as vice-chancellor of the university 1917-1919 and from 1920-1926 as principal. Personal life In 1890 he married Caroline Matilda MacManus of Kiltimagh, Ireland and they had one daughter. His wife died in 1935 and Perry on 5 December 1938 at his home in Worthing, Sussex. After cremation his ashes were buried at the church in his old home at Seighford. Of all Perry's great talents his most important contributions were as an outstanding administrator.

He is depicted as a thin, unnaturally tall humanoid with a featureless head and face, wearing a black suit. Stories of the Slender Man commonly feature him stalking, abducting or traumatizing people, particularly children. The Slender Man is not confined to a single narrative but appears in many disparate works of fiction, typically composed online. Fiction relating to the Slender Man encompasses many media, including literature, art and video series such as Marble Hornets, wherein he is known as The Operator. The character has appeared in the video game Slender: The Eight Pages and its successor Slender: The Arrival, as well as inspiring the Enderman in Minecraft. He has also appeared in a film adaptation of Marble Hornets, where he was portrayed by Doug Jones, and the film Slender Man, where he was portrayed by Javier Botet. Beginning in 2014, a moral panic occurred over the Slender Man after readers of his fiction were connected to several violent acts, particularly a near- fatal stabbing of a 12-year-old girl in Waukesha, Wisconsin. History =Origin= The writings of H. P. Lovecraft influenced the creation of the Slender Man. The Slender Man was created on June 10, 2009, on a thread in the Something Awful Internet forum. The thread was a Photoshop contest in which users were challenged to \\"create paranormal images.\\" Forum poster Eric Knudsen, under the pseudonym \\"Victor Surge\\", contributed two black-and-white images of groups of children to which he added a tall, thin, spectral figure wearing a black suit. Although previous entries had consisted solely of photographs, Surge supplemented his submission with snatches of text‚Äîsupposedly from witnesses‚Äîdescribing the abductions of the groups of children and giving the character the name \\"The Slender Man\\": The quote under the first photograph read: The quote under the second photograph read: These additions effectively transformed the photographs into a work of fiction. Subsequent posters expanded upon the character, adding their own visual or textual contributions. Knudsen was inspired to create the Slender Man primarily by Zack Parsons' \\"That Insidious Beast\\", Stephen King's The Mist, reports of shadow people, Mothman and the Mad Gasser of Mattoon. Other inspirations for the character were the Tall Man from the 1979 film Phantasm, H. P. Lovecraft, the surrealist work of William S. Burroughs, and the survival horror video games Silent Hill and Resident Evil. Knudsen's intention was \\"to formulate something whose motivations can barely be comprehended, and [which caused] unease and terror in a general population.\\" Other pre-existing fictional or legendary creatures which are similar to the Slender Man include: the Gentlemen, black-suited, pale, bald demons from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode \\"Hush\\"; Men in black, many accounts of which grant them an uncanny appearance with an unnatural walk and \\"oriental\\" features; and The Question, a DC Comics superhero with a blank face, whose secret identity is \\"Victor Sage\\", a name similar to Knudsen's alias \\"Victor Surge\\". In her book, Folklore, Horror Stories, and the Slender Man: The Development of an Internet Mythology, Professor Shira Chess of the University of Georgia connected the Slender Man to ancient folklore about fairies. Like fairies, the Slender Man is otherworldly, with motives that are often difficult to grasp; like fairies, his appearance is vague and often shifts to reflect what the viewer wants or fears to see, and, like fairies, the Slender Man calls the woods and wild places his home and kidnaps children. =Early development= The Slender Man soon went viral,There is some dispute over whether the Slender Man qualifies as a viral phenomenon, since under some definitions, viral phenomena must spread quickly, while the Slender Man initially spread rather slowly. Some therefore prefer the term \\"spreadable\\" to viral. See spawning numerous works of fanart, cosplay, and online fiction known as \\"creepypasta\\"--horror stories told in short snatches of easily copyable text that spread from site to site. Divorced from its original creator, the Slender Man became the subject of myriad stories by multiple authors within an overarching mythos. Many aspects of the Slender Man mythos first appeared on the original Something Awful thread. One of the earliest additions was added by a forum user named \\"Thoreau-Up\\", who created a folklore story set in 16th-century Germany involving a character called Der Gro·∫ûman, which was implied to be an early reference to the Slender Man. The first video series involving the Slender Man evolved from a post on the Something Awful thread by user \\"ce gars\\". It tells of a fictional film school friend named Alex Kralie, who had stumbled upon something troubling while shooting his first feature-length project, Marble Hornets. The video series, published in found footage style on YouTube, forms an alternate reality game describing the filmers' fictional experiences with the Slender Man. The ARG also incorporates a Twitter feed and an alternate YouTube channel created by a user named \\"totheark\\". As of 2013, Marble Hornets had over 250,000 subscribers around the world and had received 55 million views. Other Slender Man-themed YouTube serials followed, including EverymanHYBRID and TribeTwelve. In 2012, the Slender Man was adapted into a video game titled Slender: The Eight Pages; within its first month of release, the game was downloaded over 2 million times. Several popular variants of the game followed, including Slenderman's Shadow and Slender Man for iOS, which became the second most-popular app download. The sequel to Slender: The Eight Pages, Slender: The Arrival, was released in 2013. Several independent films about the Slender Man have been released or are in development, including Entity and The Slender Man, released free online after a $10,000 Kickstarter campaign. In 2013, it was announced that Marble Hornets would become a feature film. =Description= The \\"Slender Man symbol\\" introduced by Marble Hornets Because the Slender Man's fictional \\"mythology\\" has evolved without an official \\"canon\\" for reference, his appearance, motives, habits, and abilities are not fixed but change depending on the storyteller. He is most commonly described as very tall and thin with unnaturally long, tentacle-like arms (or merely tentacles), which he can extend to intimidate or capture prey. In most stories his face is white and featureless, but occasionally his face appears differently to anyone who sees it. He appears to be wearing a dark suit and tie. The Slender Man is often associated with the forest and/or abandoned locations and has the ability to teleport. Proximity to the Slender Man is often said to trigger a \\"Slender sickness\\"; a rapid onset of paranoia, nightmares and delusions accompanied by nosebleeds. Early stories featured him targeting children or young adults. Some featured young adults driven insane or to act on his behalf, while others did not, and others claim that investigating the Slender Man will draw his attention. The web series Marble Hornets established the idea of proxies (humans who fall under the Slender Man's influence) though initially they were simply violently insane, rather than puppets of the Slender Man. Marble Hornets also introduced the idea that the Slender Man could interfere with video and audio recordings, as well as the \\"Slender Man symbol\\", ‚¶ª, which became a common trope of Slender fiction. Graphic violence and body horror are uncommon in the Slender Man mythos, with many narratives choosing to leave the fate of his victims obscure. Shira Chess notes that \\"It is important to note that few of the retellings identify exactly what kind of monster the Slender Man might be, and what his specific intentions are- these points all remain mysteriously and usefully vague.\\" =Reasons for popularity= Cosplay of the Slender Man in 2013 Media scholar and folklorist Andrew Peck attributes the success of the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression. Although nearly all users understand that the Slender Man is not real, they suspend that disbelief in order to become more engrossed when telling or listening to stories. This adds a sense of authenticity to Slender Man legend performances and blurs the lines between legend and reality, keeping the creature as an object of legend dialectic. This ambiguity has led some to some confusion over the character's origin and purpose. Only five months after his creation, George Noory's Coast to Coast AM, a radio call-in show devoted to the paranormal and conspiracy theories, began receiving callers asking about the Slender Man. Two years later, an article in the Minneapolis Star Tribune described his origins as \\"difficult to pinpoint.\\" Eric Knudsen has commented that many people, despite understanding that the Slender Man was created on the Something Awful forums, still entertain the possibility that he might be real. Shira Chess describes the Slender Man as a metaphor for \\"helplessness, power differentials, and anonymous forces.\\" Peck sees parallels between the Slender Man and common anxieties about the digital age, such as feelings of constant connectedness and unknown third-party observation. Similarly, Tye Van Horn, a writer for The Elm, has suggested that the Slender Man represents modern fear of the unknown; in an age flooded with information, people have become so unaccustomed to ignorance that they now fear what they cannot understand. Troy Wagner, the creator of Marble Hornets, ascribes the terror of the Slender Man to its malleability; people can shape it into whatever frightens them most. Tina Marie Boyer noted that \\"The Slender man is a prohibitive monster, but the cultural boundaries he guards are not clear. Victims do not know when they have violated or crossed them.\\" =Waukesha stabbing= On May 31, 2014, two 12-year-old girls in Waukesha, Wisconsin held down and stabbed a 12-year-old classmate 19 times. When questioned later by authorities, they reportedly claimed that they wished to commit a murder as a first step to becoming proxies for the Slender Man, having read about it online. They also stated that they were afraid that Slender Man would kill their families if they did not commit the murder. After the perpetrators left the scene, the victim crawled out of the woods to a roadway. A passing cyclist alerted authorities, and the victim survived the attack. Both attackers have been diagnosed with mental illnesses but have also been charged as adults and are each facing up to 65 years in prison. One of the girls reportedly said Slender Man watches her, can read minds, and could teleport. Experts testified in court that she also said she conversed with Lord Voldemort and one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her prosecution was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved enough for her to stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that she knew what she was doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital. On December 21, Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren sentenced Weier, then 16 years old, to be hospitalized for 25 years from the date of the crime, which would keep her institutionalized until age 37. In a statement to the media on June 4, 2014, Eric Knudsen said, \\"I am deeply saddened by the tragedy in Wisconsin and my heart goes out to the families of those affected by this terrible act.\\" He stated he would not be giving interviews on the matter. On September 25, 2017, it was reported that Morgan Geyser, then 15, had agreed to plead guilty to attempting to commit first-degree homicide in an arrangement that would allow her avoid jail time. In terms of the arrangement Geyser would remain at the mental hospital where she had been staying for the past two years for at least a further three years. On February 1, 2018, the Associated Press reported that Geyser had been sentenced to 40 years in the Wisconsin mental hospital, the maximum sentence allowed. =Moral panic and other incidents= The stabbing in Waukesha spawned a nationwide moral panic over Slender Man across the United States. Parents across the nation became worried about the potential dangers that stories about Slender Man might pose to their children's safety. Russell Jack, the police chief of Waukesha, warned that the Slender Man stabbing \\"should be a wake-up call for all parents\\" that \\"the internet is full of dark and wicked things\\"‚Äîa warning which numerous media outlets publicized. After hearing the story, an unidentified woman from Cincinnati, Ohio, told a WLWT TV reporter in June 2014 that her 13-year-old daughter had attacked her with a knife, and had written macabre fiction, some involving the Slender Man, who the mother said motivated the attack. On September 4, 2014, a 14-year-old girl in Port Richey, Florida, allegedly set her family's house on fire while her mother and nine-year-old brother were inside. Police reported that the teenager had been reading online stories about Slender Man as well as Atsushi ≈åkubo's manga Soul Eater. Eddie Daniels of the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said the girl \\"had visited the website that contains a lot of the Slender Man information and stories [...] It would be safe to say there is a connection to that.\\" During an early 2015 epidemic of suicide attempts by young people ages 12 to 24 on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Slender Man was cited as an influence; the Oglala Sioux tribe president noted that many Native Americans traditionally believe in a \\"suicide spirit\\" similar to the Slender Man. Other Sioux describe the \\"Big Man\\" as a messenger or sign, warning that society is developing in a dangerous direction. A documentary film on the incident called Beware the Slenderman, directed by Irene Taylor Brodsky, was released by HBO Films in March 2016, and was broadcast on HBO on January 23, 2017. =After the Waukesha stabbing= The Waukesha stabbing and the negative media attention it generated irreversibly altered the Slender Man legend and the online community surrounding it. What had previously just been a creepy horror meme to most people suddenly acquired a new level of reality that most fans of Slender Man found horrifying. Meanwhile, by around the same time, the Slender Man character had lost much of his original popularity. Most of the original blogs that had once been devoted to Slender Man either shut down completely or became less popular. Slender Man's presence in mainstream popular culture also contributed to a decline in how frightening he seemed to many people. The late 2010s also saw an increase in benevolent portrayals of Slender Man, with many depictions of him from this period portraying him as an antihero who protects victimized children from bullies, although often by violent means. In some portrayals of Slender Man from the late 2010s, he has a daughter named Skinny Sally, who is portrayed as a young girl covered in cuts and bruises. Slender Man sometimes is portrayed carrying Skinny Sally on his shoulders protectively. Lynn McNeill, assistant professor of folklore at Utah State University, observes that the increase in benevolent portrayals of Slender Man seems to have begun shortly after the stabbing in Waukesha and states that this trend towards a benevolent Slender Man may be a reaction by fans of the character to the violence of the stabbing. Despite the decline in popular interest in Slender Man, commercial adaptations of the character continued. In 2015, the film adaptation of Marble Hornets, titled Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story, was released on VOD, where the character was portrayed by Doug Jones. In 2016, Sony Pictures subsidiary Screen Gems partnered with Mythology Entertainment to bring a Slender Man film into theatres, with the title character portrayed by Javier Botet. The film generated considerable controversy soon after it was announced, with many accusing the filmmakers of trying to capitalize off the Waukesha stabbing. Bill Weier, the father of Anissa Weier, stated, \\"It's absurd they want to make a movie like this... All we're doing is extending the pain all three of these families have gone through.\\" The progressive advocacy group Care2 created an online petition, which received over 19,000 signatures, demanding that the film not be released, labelling the film \\"crass commercialism at its worst\\" and \\"a naked cash grab built on the exploitation of a deeply traumatic event and the people who lived it.\\" Sony representatives insisted that the film was based on the fictional character that had become popular online and not on the Waukesha stabbing. Upon its release in August 2018, the film Slender Man, despite being declared a box-office bomb and receiving both little marketing and overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, went on to gross several times its $10 million budget worldwide. David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a D, writing \\"a tasteless and inedibly undercooked serving of the Internet's stalest creepypasta, Slender Man aspires to be for the YouTube era what The Ring was to the last gasps of the VHS generation. But... there's one fundamental difference that sets the two movies apart: The Ring is good, and Slender Man is terrible.\\" Writing for The Verge, Carli Velocci called the Slender Man movie \\"a nail in the coffin of a dying fandom\\". Folkloric qualities Several scholars have argued that, despite being a fictional work with an identifiable origin point, the Slender Man represents a form of digital folklore. Shira Chess argues that the Slender Man exemplifies the similarities between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, the fact that the Slender Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form. Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the audience's response). Andrew Peck also considers the Slender Man to be an authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity despite the lack of a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication. Jeff Tolbert also accepts the Slender Man as folkloric and suggests it represents a process he calls ‚Äúreverse ostension.‚Äù Ostension in folkloristics is the process of acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of \\"traditional\\" narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition). Professor Thomas Pettitt of the University of Southern Denmark has described the Slender Man as being an exemplar of the modern age's closing of the \\"Gutenberg Parenthesis\\"; the time period from the invention of the printing press to the spread of the web in which stories and information were codified in discrete media, to a return to the older, more primal forms of storytelling, exemplified by oral tradition and campfire tales, in which the same story can be retold, reinterpreted and recast by different tellers, allowing the lore to expand and evolve with time. Copyright Despite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man is not in the public domain. Several for-profit ventures involving the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television. The identity of this option holder has not been made public. Knudsen himself has argued that his enforcement of copyright has less to do with money than with artistic integrity: \\"I just want something amazing to come off it... something that's scary and disturbing and kinda different. I would hate for something to come out and just be kinda conventional.\\" As of May 2016, the media rights to Slender Man have been sold to production company Mythology Entertainment.

The last of 6000-series cars were retired on December 4, 1992. These cars were in service for 42 years. Design In 1947‚Äì1948 the CTA received four three-car articulated trainsets, 5001‚Äì5004, to test PCC technology in rapid transit use. Two sets of cars were built by Pullman, two by St. Louis Car, with equipment supplied by competing suppliers, in order to test them directly against each other. The 6000-series was designed with knowledge from the 5000-series. =Bodies= 5000-series bodies had a curved profile previously used by North Shore Line and then Chicago, Aurora & Elgin cars which operated on the L. The floor width was the needed for platform clearance, then above the sides curved outward, so the car was wider at seat level. This profile was used, 6000-series cars were wider at the seats than the floor. Blinker doors which fold and open inward were also successful and were used in the 6000-series. Articulation was not repeated; the 6000s were individual cars semi-permanently attached in pairs. The outside end of both cars had a cab, making a two-car double-ended arrangement. This has become the CTA standard. St Louis built all 6000-series cars, as well as the 1-50 series, many with components salvaged from Pullman streetcars. =Driveline= The 5000s had modified Clark and St Louis trucks with wheels for speeds of x. The 6000s had more standard streetcar trucks, with wheels. These had a top speed of 50, which was adequate for CTA needs until the high- speed Skokie Swift shuttle started in 1964. The first 200 cars were built with new components, including Clark B-2 trucks, the next 310 cars had Clark B-2s salvaged from Pullman streetcars, and the final 210, plus most of the similar 1-50 class, had St Louis B-3s salvaged from St Louis streetcars. All cars had Westinghouse XDA1 controls. 6001‚Äì6488 had Westinghouse 1432 motors, all following cars had General Electric 1220 motors. Both type motors delivered . The exceptions are test cars 6127‚Äì6130, which had non-standard equipment and higher performance. Routes The 6000-series became the standard of the system, and were used almost everywhere. In 1975 there were still over 700 6000s in service. Initially, all of the first 130 6000s were assigned to the Logan Square line. The North-South and Ravenswood lines had 6000s in service in 1952 (with the 4000-series cars taking the 6000s' place on the Logan Square line); other lines (except the Lake Street line, presumably due to width clearance issues on the at-grade section of the line west of Laramie Avenue, which was also powered by overhead wire) received cars when they became available. Because of overhead wire, no 6000s were used on the Skokie or Evanston lines, except 6127‚Äì6130, which received trolley poles for express service on the Evanston line. (The western section of the Lake line was elevated in 1962; however, it remained equipped entirely with 4000s until the arrival of the 2000-series cars from Pullman-Standard in 1964.) Two of the routes that the 6000s were not used on were served by their single car variants, the 1-50 series. The Evanston line began to receive additional 6000s after it converted entirely from overhead wire to third rail in 1973. When the Dan Ryan line was opened in 1969, newer cars were assigned there, but 6000s were sometimes used for special movements. CTA sold some of the cars to SEPTA for use on the Norristown High Speed Line during the delay of the N-5 car delivery.

Situated topographically on the plateau between the Torridge and Taw Rivers, the parish covers and contains a population of some 258 parishioners. It is surrounded by a pastoral landscape of rectangular fields, high hedges and scattered farmsteads. Historic estates Various historic estates are situated within the parish of Roborough, including: =Owlacombe= The estate of OLECU(M)BE is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as the 7th of the 27 Devonshire holdings of Theobald FitzBerner (fl.1086),Thorn, Caroline & Frank, (eds.) Domesday Book, (Morris, John, gen.ed.)

His tenant was Gotshelm. The mansion house survives today as \\"Owlacombe\\", south-west of the village of Roborough. =Combe / Over Wollocombe= Much confusion exists in historical sources concerning the estates of Over Wollocombe and Combe, which appear to refer to the same place. Over Wollocombe, a seat of the Wollocombe family, was stated by Pole (d.1635) to have been situated in the parish of Roborough:Pole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.394 :\\"Over Wollacombe, in the parish of Rowburgh, hath had of the name of Wollacomb his owner many generacions & doth contynewe it unto this day\\". Certainly in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries many members of the Wollocombe family \\"of Combe\\" were baptised, married and buried at Roborough.Vivian, p.795-7, pedigree of \\"Wollocombe of Combe\\" The family became extinct in the male line on the death of Roger Wollocombe (1632-1704), buried at Roborough, who left two or three surviving daughters as his co-heiresses. The 5th-born daughter Mary Wollocombe (1666-1701) married John Stafford (1674-1721) of Stafford Barton in the nearby parish of Dolton, whose eldest son Roger Stafford (1696-1732) assumed the surname Wollocombe in lieu of his patronymic, following the death of his uncle Roger Wollocombe (1632-1704). He died without surviving male progeny, when his heir became his younger brother Thomas Stafford (1697-1756), who likewise assumed the surname Wollocombe and was buried at Roborough. He married a daughter of the prominent Rolle family. His sons adopted the surname Stafford-Wollocombe. His daughter Henrietta Stafford (born 1732) married Henry Hole of Ebberly, in the parish of Roborough. Her son Thomas Hole in 1819 was resident at Stafford Barton.Lysons, Daniel & Lysons, Samuel, Magna Britannia, Vol.6, Devonshire, London, 1822 The Stafford-Wollocombe family later moved to Bidlake in the parish of Bridestowe, having inherited that estate by marriage.Vivian, pp.796, 84 \\"Combe Barton\\" in Roborough survives today as a Tudor house, which contains in the hall a \\"large heraldic late Tudor (or early c.17) plaster overmantel\\"Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, pp.287-8 displaying within a strapwork cartouche the arms of Wollocombe \\"with two figures and two fronds\\" below.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-91779-coombe-barton-and- adjoining-front-garden-#.WKHHHvK5Qqc; See images The arms show Argent, three bars gules (Wollocombe) impaling a lion rampant, apparently for Elford: Per pale argent and azure, a lion rampant gules (Vivian, p.329), see :File:ElfordArms.png. This therefore represents the marriage of Roger Wollocombe (1632-1704) (4th son and eventual heir to his father John Wollocombe (1598-1663) of Coombe) to Gertrude Elford (d.1681), a daughter and co-heiress of John Elford of Sheepstor. His father married a Fortescue, whose own father married a Coffin, whose own father married a Basset, whose own father married a Pollard, none of which well-known and prominent Devon families bore arms containing a lion rampant. Risdon (d.1640) however stated Over Wollocombe to have been in the parish of Mortehoe, Risdon, Tristram (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.341 about 18 miles north-west of Roborough, the modern beach-resort of Woolacombe. According to Risdon this estate in the parish of Mortehoe was the original home of the Wollocombe family, which later moved to \\"Combe\\"Risdon, p.270 in the parish of Roborough, which it inherited following the marriage of Thomas Wollocombe to Elizabeth Barry, daughter and heiress of Henry At-Combe (alias Barry, a younger son of the Barry family, lords of the manor of Roborough, who \\"was called after the name of this house\\"Risdon, p.270)Risdon, p.270; Pole, p.394; Vivian, p.795 Risdon calls the Wollocombe seat in the parish of Roborough simply \\"Combe\\".Risdon, p.270 =Ebberly= Ebberly House, viewed from south Ebberly is a hamlet within Roborough parish. The hamlet has several prominent white houses by the roadside, including Ebberley Hill Barton (formerly a coaching inn called Ebberley Arms and now operating as Ebberley Escapes Bed and Breakfast), a mansion house known as Ebberly House and a Methodist chapel. The estate of Ebberley is first recorded, as Emberlegh, in the 13th century Book of Fees.Thorn, Caroline & Frank, (eds.) Domesday Book, (Morris, John, gen.ed.)

During the reign of King Henry VI (1422-1461) following the death of Walter de Ebberleigh with no surviving son, the estate passed to Roger Davy (alias Dewy) who had married Walter's daughter and heiress Thomasine de Ebberleigh.Vivian, Lt.Col.

He has been involved in a refugee crisis and has served as bishop in the Central District of the Methodist Church, and was suspended in 2010 on the grounds that he had exceeded his authority. Training and career Verryn is a graduate of Rhodes University in the Eastern Cape (B.Arts and B.Divinity). From 1973 to 1983 he served as a minister in the Methodist Circuits of Uitenhage, Southern Transkei, Grahamstown and Port Elizabeth. In 1984 Verryn was moved to what is now Gauteng Province,later to Roodepoort (1984‚Äì1987) and then to Soweto (1988-1997). In 1997 Verryn was elected as Bishop of the Central District, and began serving also as a minister in the Johannesburg Circuit, where his home church was the Johannesburg Central Methodist Society. =Additional positions= Verryn was also appointed as Supervisor of Studies (of student ministers) during the period 1982-1997, and as a John Wesley College tutor from 1994 to 1997. In 1994 he also assumed the position of: *Chair of the South African College for Teacher Education *Convenor of the Training Programme (Phase 1) for Methodist ministers *Superintendent of the Soweto Community Centre. Other positions which Verryn holds include *Chairmanship of the National Cancer Association, Eastern Cape; *Council Member and also Trustee of St. Stithian's College. In the Apartheid era =An anti- Apartheid activist= \\"Paul has said that he was 'radicalised' in the Eastern Cape, where he gave shelter to activists fleeing from the security police during South Africa's apartheid days.\\" He also served as Chair of the Detainees Parents Support Committee during 1982-83. (South African law during this time allowed detention without trial under certain circumstances). =Stompie Seipei= In 1989 a media furor erupted following the abduction of four youths and the murder of James Seipei, also known as Stompie Sepei. Verryn had provided accommodation as a place of safety at the Orlando Mission house (Manse) for the four. At the time this was also his residence as the minister for the Soweto Circuit. Verryn was then also prominent as one of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's critics. On 29 December 1988 the Mandela United Football Club (MUFC) abducted the four boys from the Mission house. The MUFC was a private force of bodyguards, who answered to and were controlled by Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, then Nelson Mandela's wife and a leading anti- apartheid activist. Following the abduction, Madikizela-Mandela alleged that Verryn had been abusing the boys sexually. Some of the boys initially supported the allegation, but later retracted their statements, saying that the MUFC members had forced them to support the claim. Madikizela-Mandela also claimed that Seipei (Moeketsi) was a police informer, a charge which in those days could have resulted in mob execution of the accused.http://www.stanford.edu/class/history48q/Documents/EMBARGO/2chap6f.htm (extract from the report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, published 2007) Seipei's body was found on 6 January 1989, dumped on waste ground in Soweto. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that the purpose of the abduction had been to force the boys to accuse Verryn of sexual abuse, and, after hearing testimony from all surviving witnesses and accusers, specifically cleared Verryn of any charges of sexual abuse.Fred Brigland: Katiza's journey. Beneath the surface of South Africa's shame. London, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1997. The Zimbabwean refugee crisis The Johannesburg Central Methodist Church, under the leadership of Bishop Paul Verryn, had established a tradition of ministering to the poor and marginalised in the city centre. When the flow of Zimbabwean refugees into South Africa had been significantly reduced, the South African government removed special controls which it had been forced to put in place. However, refugees and illegal immigrants continued to enter the country in relatively limited numbers, mostly from Zimbabwe. Many of them were destitute and jobless as well as being homeless. Over the objections of some of his church members, Verryn offered Johannesburg Central Methodist Church to this need. The steady inflow of refugees soon filled the church, which lacking all suitable facilities, nevertheless accommodated over 1500 refugees who slept on the pews and the floors; anywhere they could find a space. In 2008 the South African Police raided the church in search of illegal immigrants. About 1500 people were held, in most cases temporarily. During 2008 and continuing into 2009 an increasing tide of resentment (labelled \\"xenophobia\\" by the media) against these foreigners peaked and broke out into anti-foreigner riots. Many Zimbabwean immigrants (whether legal or illegal), together with Mozambicans, Malawians, Taiwanese and others from any other African country became victims of the violence, losing lives, businesses, jobs and families. The need for a place of safety for Zimbabwean (and other) refugees became urgent. The Zimbabwean refugee ark of Johannesburg Central Methodist Church began to burst at the seams. During the later part of 2008 the police found it necessary to guard the refugees with shotgun armed officers. Verryn requested the Johannesburg city authorities to provide for the refugees, but at the same time refused to allow immigration authorities to enter the sanctuary of the church to identify illegal immigrants. Early in 2009 the local municipality began to make plans to alleviate the situation at the church. Meanwhile, inevitably, thefts, fights and assaults occurred among the refugees. Several young girls claimed that they had been raped, or sexually abused. In the latter part of 2009, once again Verryn was accused of abusing children and/or young women among the refugees. An exhaustive investigation by the media revealed no evidence whatever to substantiate the accusations against him. All of the girls who had claimed rape or sexual assault identified men other than Verryn as the guilty ones. The medical staff of M√©decins sans Fronti√®res, who by now also worked among the refugees, stated that they had treated only one girl for rape, and that this attack had not taken place at the church. Suspension In January 2010, the MCSA laid undisclosed internal charges against Verryn, and after a hearing he was suspended on 19 January 2010. A statement was later released that the basis for the charges had been that Verryn had exceeded his authority. It has been suggested that the fact that South Africa was to hold the FIFA Soccer World Cup in July 2010 had something to do with the government's urgent need to clean up the city, and with the Methodist church's decision to at last take decisive action in the matter. Others have suggested that the official grounds for Verryn's suspension amounted to a cover-up. While suspended from his position as Bishop and his station as minister and superintendent of the Johannesburg Circuit, Verryn remains an ordained minister within the Methodist Church.

Starting earlier in the year, a widespread drought caused many areas to be exposed to wildfires. Starting in late July and early August, the wildfires burned at least 52,000 acres, and destroyed at least 121 homes and businesses. A wildfire near Luther in Central Oklahoma destroyed about 50 homes and other buildings before getting under control on August 4. Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin declared a state of emergency on July 30 due to the drought and wildfires. Although property damage was substantial, no human lives due to the fires were reported. This may have been because a number of threatened communities were evacuated before fires reached them. Governor requests federal assistance Governor Fallin submitted a major disaster request to FEMA on September 17, 2012, for the period July 28 - August 14, 2012. The request was for Federal assistance to three counties, as well as statewide Hazard Mitigation. Joint Federal, State and local Preliminary Damage Assessments (PDAs) were conducted in the requested counties during September 18-24, 2012. Based on the PDAs, FEMA concluded that, \\"... the damage was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the combined capabilities of the state and affected local governments,\\" and thus Federal assistance was denied. Governor Fallin was informed of the decision on October 15, 2012.\\"Oklahoma Wildfires Denial.\\" Federal Emergency Management Agency. October 15, 2012. Accessed November 16, 2017.

Unlike many of the fires, this blaze was blamed on human activity. Two companies had been conducting welding operations in the area, and were sued for damages. Outdoor welding was actually prohibited, because of a statewide burn ban that had gone into effect the previous day. Weather caused the fire to spread rapidly; the fire marshall of nearby Stillwater, Oklahoma said in an interview that the winds were blowing at and that the high temperature was 107 degrees Fahrenheit. He said it was the 20th straight day of triple-digit temperatures. Only a late wind change spared the town from being totally destroyed. In 2016, a jury decided that, \\"... IPS Engineering L.L.C. was responsible for 30 percent of the damage the wildfire caused, and Global Pipeline Construction LLC was responsible for the other 70 percent.\\" The two companies were ordered to pay 72 plaintiffs a total of $6.5 million in compensation.

He was a director of the family company, GH Michell and Sons, for 60 years, and instrumental in its rise to be the largest wool processing company in the world. Born in Adelaide, South Australia, Michell was educated at Prince Alfred College. Early life Michell was born in Adelaide on 3 August 1913 to George Howard Michell and Annie Jane Walters Michell was an active sportsman his whole life. He was a rower in the school First Eight, and later the Old Boy's Eight. In 1935 he joined the Adelaide Aero Club On 3 December 1938 Michell married Christine Valerie Tipping at St. Andrew's Church, Walkerville. =Mt Bogong tragedy= In August 1936, at the age of 23, Michell set out on a cross-country skiing expedition to Mount Bogong, Victoria with two experienced skiers, Cleve Cole and Mick Hull. Leaving Hotham Heights on 5 August, they set out across the Bogong High Plains carrying provisions for several days. They intended to reach the summit of Mt Bogong and then continue over the far side to the Staircase Hut, in which they had stored provisions for the return trip during the summer. On 6 August they were overcome by the worst blizzard in several years. The men dug a snow cave and waited four days for the blizzard to end. On 9 August, with food already running short, they decided to make a break for the Staircase Hut, but lost their way in the whiteout conditions. They were unable to retrace their steps, and therefore wandered for five days without food, descending the wrong side of Mt Bogong in the fog. On the 14th, the men reached Big River Valley and sought refuge in a hollow log, but they were severely weakened from exhaustion, starvation and exposure. Cole was unable to continue, and it was decided that Hull should stay with him while Michell set out in search of help. Late on the night of 16 August Michell reached the settlement at Glen Valley and raised the alarm. Search parties totalling eighty men set out the following morning. Michell, suffering frostbite to his hands and feet, was taken to Omeo hospital by car. All of his toes had to be amputated. A party of seven searchers located Hull and Cole early on the 18th. Using improvised stretchers, they were brought to Glen Valley. Hull began to recover but little hope was held for Cole, who was delirious and badly frostbitten. Cole died late on the night of the 19th. The following year, the Royal Humane Society of Australasia awarded Michell and Hull each a silver medal for gallantry. The ordeal led to the establishment of snow-lines and series of refuge huts on Bogong to render shelter to future skiers; these include the Cleve Cole Hut (built 1937) and Michell Hut (1967). Michell Hut was burnt in the bushfires of 2003, and a replacement built in 2005. GH Michell and Sons A couple of years after the Mt Bogong tragedy, Michell became managing director of the family company, GH Michell and Sons, then based at Hindmarsh. During his time, the company was buying 10‚Äì15% of the entire Australian wool clip. In the 1940s after the imperative of wartime production had passed, Michell set about modernising the company's operations. State-of-the-art British Combing machines were imported, using both the traditional Noble type and the more efficient French type. This enabled an increase in the overall output of wool tops by 30%, as well as the use of shorter-fibered wool varieties, which previously had been sent overseas for processing. The quality of tops was also improved by this method, producing wool suitable for the manufacture of fine clothing. In 1947, Michell pioneered an incentive wage scheme at the company's Hindmarsh and Fremantle processing facilities, whereby the typical worker could earn an average of 27% above the award wage for production beyond standard output levels. Michell consolidated its operations to its present Salisbury site in 1973. He also drove an international expansion of the company's wool and tannery operation, particularly in China and Ireland. In 1987, when the company closed down its wool processing operations at Botany Bay, Michell established an industrial park, Lakes Business Park, on the site. Philanthropy Howard and Christine Michell were keen supporters of the performing and visual arts. They made considerable contributions to the Art Gallery of South Australia, both financially and of works. They were involved in setting up the gallery's foundation in 1980. They also set up an endowment fund to support and purchase the works of young and emerging artists. In 1990 Michell was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for his services to the wool industry and the arts.

He was popularly known as Bamuni Konwar (Brahman prince) because of his upbringing in a Brahman's house. His reign marks the first stage in the growth of Hinduism in the Ahom dynasty. He initiated the Singarigharutha ceremony (coronation ceremony) of the Ahom kings, a tradition which was followed by his successors. Birth and childhood Sudangphaa was the son of Ahom king Tyao Khamti, from his younger queen. Tyao Khamti went on a military expedition against the Chutiya Kingdom, to avenge the murder of his elder brother, king Sutuphaa. He appointed his elder queen in charge of the kingdom, in his absence. The younger queen was pregnant at the time of the king's departure. The elder queen was jealous of the younger queen as the latter was more favourite to the king and also she was about to give birth to king's first child, which will enhance her position. Therefore, in order to get rid of younger queen, the elder queen took advantage of her position as regent to cause a false accusation to be preferred against her. The charge was investigated and declared true, whereupon the elder queen ordered her to be beheaded. The ministers however, seeing that she was pregnant, instead of killing her set her adrift on the Dihing on a raft. The Habung region at the time was under the control of Chutia kings. Rajkumar, Sarbananda,Chutiya, Bhuyan aru Matak Rajya,p.40. \\"Habung was a Chutiya dependency; that still earlier it was an autonomous principality of Brahmins; and that the latter's origins could be traced back to a circa 10th-century copper-plate and grant issued by king Ratnapala\\"\\"It appears that the novel designation of Barpatragohain was borrowed from the civil list of Habung, where the local ruler, a dependent of the Chutia king, had the title Vrihatpatra\\" She died after giving birth to a boy and told the Brahman about the real identity of the boy. The Brahman brought up the young prince along with his other children. The young prince took the Brahman and his family as his own and spent his childhood with them. Assassination of Tyao Khamti King Tyao Khamti was horrified to hear of the execution of his favourite wife, especially when a new and impartial inquiry showed that the allegations against her were false. He was, however, too much under the influence of his elder queen to venture to take action against her. This, and his failure to prevent her from committing numerous acts of oppression, irritated the nobles so much that in 1389 CE, they caused him to be assassinated. The notorious elder queen was also put to death and was entombed along with the king in Charaideo. Accession to the throne Since there were no suitable successors to the throne, Chaothai Khum Burhagohain and Borgohain ruled the kingdom without a king from 1389 to 1397. In 1397, an Ahom trader named Thao Cheoken went across the Brahmaputra to trade in cattle, and there, in Habung village, he saw the young prince. Curious of the young boy's noble appearance, he made inquiries about him, and learnt that he was the son of king Tyao Khamti's younger queen. The Burhagohain was informed of these facts and after verifying the story and consulting the other ministers, he brought the young prince, who was then fifteen years of age, to the capital Charaideo and placed him on the throne. He took the name Sudangphaa and took control of his royal authority. Reign =Introduction of Hindu religious rituals in Ahom court= Sudangphaa brought with him from the Habung country the Brahman who had sheltered him and his sons. The latter were given post of importance on the frontier, while the old Brahman himself was installed as his confidential adviser, and, under his influence, many Hindu rites and ceremonies began to be observed. The Brahman introduced the prayer of Lakshmi- Narayan Salagram in the royal palace. It was the beginning of Brahmanical influence and attraction towards Hinduism in the Ahom Dynasty. =Suppression of Tipam Chiefs= The Tipam Chiefs, who were dissatisfied with the new regime, hatched a plot against the young king. This came to his ears, but instead of at once taking open steps against the conspirators, he caused a stockade for catching elephants to be constructed, and having caught some elephants, invited them to join him in the celebrating the occasion by a feast. When the festivities were in full swing and all suspicion had been allayed, the conspirators were suddenly overpowered and put to death. According to a practice which was common among the Ahoms and many Asiatic tribes, their heads were piled up in a heap as a trophy. =War with Mongkawng= The reasons for the outbreak of war with Mongkawng (called Nara in Ahom chronicles), a shan state in Upper Burma, during the reign of Sudangphaa vary among the historians. One chronicle stated that Sudangphaa endeavoured to conciliate the rest of the Tipamias by marrying the daughter of one of their chiefs named Khuntai. The girl, however, had already become enamoured of a Tipamia named Tai Sulai, and the latter, after dining one night with the king, sent a ring to the queen by one of his servants. The king was informed of this, and called for an explanation from Tai Sulai, who fled forthwith to Surumpha, king of Mungkang, and begged for help. Some historians differ with this version of story. According to them, Tai Sulai was the youngest son of Ahom king Sukhaangphaa and princess of Kamata kingdom Bhajani (some sources say the princess name was Rajani; some said that Rajani and Bhajani were two sisters who were married to Sukhangphaa). After the assassination of Tyaokhamti, Tai Chulai attempted to become king, but the nobles led by Chaothai Khum Burhagohain opposed his candidature at that time. Later when Chaothai Khum Burhagohain and other nobles installed Sudangphaa as the king of Ahom kingdom, a disheartened Tai Chulai went to Mungkang and informed its ruler that the Ahom dynasty founded by Sukaphaa has ended and the kingdom was in the state of anarchy. However, it can be debated that Tai Sulai was actually a Tipamia and not the son of Ahom king Sukhaangphaa, as being the later would make him more than 68 years old by 1400 CE. Morever, here the writer seems to have confused Tai Chulai with the story of Chao Pulai; which is the exact same tale, but instead with Sukhaangpha's son Sukhrangpha. The rulers of Mungkang used to consider Sukaphaa and the Ahom dynasty as his kinsmen as both claim to be descendant of Lengdon or Indra, the god of heaven and earth. Surumpha, the king of Mungkang, sent a military expedition along with Tai Chulai, led by his minister, Tasim Pou Borgohain. Sudangphaa personally led his army against the invaders and a battle was fought near Kuhiarbari in the Tipam country. Sudangphaa sustained a slight wound from an enemy spear while riding on an elephant at the head of his army in the battlefield, but the battle turned in Ahom's favour and the invaders were defeated. Sudangphaa ordered Nangchukham Borgohain to chase the vanquished enemy, who chased them as far as Patkai hill range. At last, the commander of Mungkang army, Tasim Pou Borgohain, sought peace from Ahom side, to which the commander of Ahom army, Nangchukham Borgohain, agreed. A formal treaty was concluded in 1401 CE, by which the Patkai hill range was fixed as the boundary between the two countries. The meeting of the two Borgohains, who conducted the negotiations for peace, took place on the side of Nongnyang lake, twenty- eight miles south-west of Margherita and statues of them are said to have been carved in the rock there. A solemn oath of amity was sworn, and consecrated by the cutting up of a fowl. The word Patkai is said to be derived from this incident. The full name was Pat-kai-seng-keu, which means \\"cut-fowl-oath- sworn\\". The former name of the pass was Dai-kau-rang or \\"the junction of nine peaks\\". Nong-nyang means \\"lake shaking\\". =Transfer of capital and Singarigharutha ceremony= After the peace treaty with Mungkang, Sudangphaa decided to transfer his capital from Charaideo to Charguwa near Dihing river in 1403 CE. On the occasion of establishing a new capital, Sudangphaa performed the Singarigharutha ceremony, the traditional Tai-Ahom coronation ceremony of kings. The ceremony was termed as Singarigharutha because the woods of Singari tree were used to construct the main platform in which the King used to sit during the procedure of the ceremony. =Expedition against Kamata kingdom= Meanwhile, Tai Sulai, being deprived of his asylum, took refuge with the king of Kamata along with one Tipamia Konwar(who had earlier accompanied him to Mungkhang)Barua,G.C.,Ahom Buranji,p.50 Sudangphaa demanded extradition of Tai Sulai, but the ruler of Kamata refused. Sudangphaa dispatched Nangchukham Borgohain to invade Kamata. At that time, Muslim rulers from Bengal invaded Kamata. Therefore, the king of Kamata desired peace with Ahoms. He gave one of his daughters in marriage to Sudangphaa,E.A Gait wrote in the History of Assam that the name of the Kamata princess was Bhajani while another chroniclers denied it on the ground that Bhajani was the wife of Ahom king Sukhangphaa, Sudangphaa's grandfather with a dowry of two elephants and a number of horses and male and female servants, as well as a quantity of gold and silver. =Subjugation of Tipam, Khamjang and Aiton tribes= The chiefs of Tipam, Khamjang and Aiton tribes rebelled against the authority of Sudangphaa by refusing to pay tribute. It was found that the king of Nara (one of the Shan kingdoms in Upper Burma) was encouraging the rebels. Sudangphaa sent messengers to remonstrate with the king of Nara, who in turn warned the rebel chiefs not to expect any aid from him. This turn of events forced the rebel chiefs to submit to the authority of Sudangphaa. Death, character and legacy Sudangphaa died in 1407 after a reign of ten years. In his chronicle about the history of Assam, Gunaviram Barua stated that the king indulged most of his time in pleasure, which is also the reason for his demise at a young age, but its accuracy is doubtful since none of the old Ahom chronicles or Buranjis agrees with it. On the other hand, he was described as young and energetic. During his decade-long reign, he faced threats, both internal and external, yet he never lost his nerves and deals every problem with determination and wits. During the war with Mungkang, he personally led his army and gained decisive victory, despite being injured by an enemy's spear. Sudangphaa also introduced religious practices of Hinduism among the Ahom community, although it will take many more years to completely bring the Ahom community in its fold. The practice of Singarigharutha of Ahom kings was also introduced by him, which will be followed by his successors almost till the end of Ahom supremacy in Assam.

He spent time in Bali, and in Australia, where he was at the centre of the Merioola Group, before settling in London. Early life Fleischmann was born in 1896 in Pressburg, Austria-Hungary (now Bratislava, Slovakia). He studied medicine in Budapest and Prague, before turning to sculpture, and winning a scholarship to the Master School of Sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.  Australian years  \\"I Wish\\" (1946), in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney He left Europe in 1937, travelling to South Africa and Zanzibar before spending two years in Bali, where he converted from his native Judaism to Catholicism, with the encouragement of a Dutch colonial missionary, Father Buys. The forms of traditional Balinese dancers became a lifelong influence on Fleischmann‚Äôs work. Fleeing the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, Fleischmann moved to Australia in 1939, where he became the centre of the Merioola Group, named after his home in Rosemont Avenue, Woollahra. He was elected a member of the Society of Artists in Sydney, sculpting portraits of prominent Australians including Cardinal Gilroy, Governor-General Lord Gowrie, Sir Frederick Jordan, Sir John Butters, Sir Percy Spender, the pianist Gaultiero Volterra and violinist Jeanne Gautier.http://www.fleischmann.org.uk/biogaust.htmlArthur Fleischmann official website His two best-known works from this period are the 1946 wishing tree memorial I wish for the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney; and the Bronze Doors on the Mitchell Wing of the State Library of New South Wales, given by Sir William Dixson in honour of David Scott Mitchell. London years Birth of Aphrodite sculpted by Fleischmann in 1955 In 1948, Fleischmann returned to Europe and settled in London. He married his wife Joy in 1959 and their son, the photographer Dominique Fleischmann, was born in 1961. Fleischmann produced sculptures of personalities of the day, including Lord Robens, the opera singer Kathleen Ferrier, the actress Joan Collins, and the ballerina Svetlana Beriosova. His bust of Trevor Howard is in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. Fleishmann pioneered the use of perspex in sculpture, including some notable public pieces. In 1956, the Pacific Steam Navigation Company (PSNC) commissioned The Birth of Aphrodite for their ship '. Fleischmann carved the piece from a half-ton block of clear perspex built up from laminated sheets. For the 1970 World Expo in Osaka, Japan, he created a perspex fountain for the British Pavilion, entitled Harmony and progress. In 1963, he featured in a British Pathe newsreel about perspex sculpture. In 1977 his Crystal Crown, carved out of a massive block of acrylic, was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II at St Katharine Docks in London, in celebration of her Silver Jubilee. The acrylic block had originally been commissioned by Stanley Kubrick as the alien monolith in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, but Kubrick rejected it in favour of a piece made from black basalt. Fleischmann‚Äôs work was influenced by his Roman Catholic faith; he is the only artist to have sculpted four Popes from life. His Tryptych of the Holy Rosary (1958) was commissioned for the Lady Chapel at Westminster Cathedral. It consists of three clear perspex panels carved in relief. His bronze of Pope John Paul II was unveiled at the Venerable English College in Rome by the Pope on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the college in 1979. Other later portrait subjects include Sir Charles Mackerras, the ballerina Doreen Wells, and the actor Barry Humphries. His last work was a perspex water sculpture, Tribute to the Discovery of DNA; like his early \\"Bronze Doors\\", it is installed at the New South Wales State Library. Fleischmann died on 2 March 1990 at the age of 93, while on holiday in Tenerife, Canary Islands. Legacy In 2001, the Arthur Fleischmann Foundation was formed.

He is also commemorated with a plaque at his London home, 92 Carlton Hill, Westminster. The plaque was unveiled on 28 July 1998 by the Austrian and Slovak ambassadors, together with the Deputy Lord Mayor of Westminster, Joy Fleischmann, and former Arts Minister, Lord Gowrie.

He was, however, too much under the influence of his elder queen to venture to take action against her. This, and his failure to prevent her from committing numerous acts of oppression, irritated the nobles so much that in 1389 CE, they caused him to be assassinated. The notorious elder queen was also put to death and was entombed along with the king in Charaideo.Gait E.A.

His assassination resulted in another period of interregnum which lasted from 1389 CE to 1397 CE, until his son Sudangphaa by his second wife ascended the throne.

(released in German-speaking regions as Der Clou! 2) is a strategy/adventure video game developed by Neo Software and released by JoWooD Productions on 1 July 2001. It is the sequel to 1994's The Clue! (known as Der Clou! in German-speaking regions). Description The player assumes the role of Matt Tucker, a famous burglar who has just come out of prison in the city of Fortune Hills. In the beginning, Matt is reduced to a small-time crook who has to work his way back to his former glory. After performing several burglaries, alone or with the help of accomplices he has met at various locations around the city, he collects loot and fame. By selling the loot he is able to buy better tools to use in increasingly challenging missions, with the ultimate goal being the Ministry of Light. The gameplay consists of two modes, the planning mode and the live mode. The planning is done from Matt's apartment where actions and movements are carefully laid out. Then by going \\"live\\" the player will find out if the plan works or if everyone has gotten caught. Different locations can include patrolling guards and police, security systems, locked doors and cabinets and other obstacles. At the same time, Matt's different tools are useful in different situations as well as making different levels of noise. The in game map of the city of Fortune Hills The Sting! was one of the first third-person 3D games to allow the player to freely roam a city, with a transportation system (taxis) to facilitate this, many buildings he can explore and buy tools, meet accomplices or observe, prior to planning a burglary. Development The name The Sting! comes from the fact that the 1973 film The Sting has the German title \\"Der Clou\\". So when the game was called \\"Der Clou\\" in Austria, the English translation became The Sting. Reception The game received mixed reviews by the critics, with a Metascore of 73% according to Metacritic. Most of the reviewers praised the light-hearted tone of the game and the unique theme of it. IGN stated \\"I haven't played a game like this in a long time... or ever really I guess. Funny cartoony little games are much fewer and far between on the PC nowadays. While there are a share of those cartoony style games set in 2D landscapes, you'll have to look pretty hard to find more than a couple that take advantage of the third dimension to really bring colorful and silly worlds to life. Not only does the Sting do this fairly well, but it also provides some interesting gameplay\\" However, a number of problems held back the game's score on multiple occasions. Reviewers noted the clipping problems of the graphics engine, the slow pace of the game and problematic pathfinding AI as the most serious problems with the title.

The house was designed and built for Margaret Louisa Thompson Johnstone, the wealthy widow of John T. Johnstone. Completed during the late 1850s, it was destroyed in a fire during the mid-1920s. A replacement, part of a modern residential development, was later built at the site during the mid-20th century. Before the new mansion was built, Mrs. Johnstone commissioned what is known as the Chapel of the Cross, in memory of her late husband. This Gothic Revival-style structure was completed in 1852 on the plantation property. Johnstone deeded it and 10 acres to the Episcopal Diocese. The chapel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History John Taylor Johnstone, born on April 28, 1801, migrated with his family to Mississippi from Hillsborough, North Carolina, about 1820. He eventually obtained a number of farms totaling and became wealthy by enslaving people to plant and harvest cotton. The Johnstones had two daughters, Frances Ann and Helen Scrymgeour Johnstone, and two sons, Samuel and Noah Thompson Johnstone. Both sons died in 1840, the same year that the family moved to Mannsdale. Johnstone used part of his fortune to build Ingleside, a family plantation house in the Mannsdale area, for Frances and her husband, as she was his first daughter to marry. After his death, his widow Margaret Johnstone built a chapel and another plantation house, Annandale, on the large plantation property. She donated the chapel and some property to the Episcopal church in her husband's memory. The first Johnstone home on the Annandale plantation was a large log house. Tradition maintains that Johnstone was descended from the Johnstone family who once held the title Earl of Annandale and Hartfell in the Peerage of Scotland and that he named his plantation in their honor. Frances Johnstone married William J. Britton in 1844. Her father had Ingleside built for the couple as a gift; it was completed in 1846. The Italianate house, with a wide front facade, contained eight bedrooms, dressing rooms, a parlor, library, dining room, breakfast room, and an office. A side and rear view, taken during the 1910s. John T. Johnstone died on April 23, 1848, leaving Margaret a widow. Prior to building a new house at Annandale, Margaret Johnstone had the masonry Gothic Revival-style Chapel of the Cross, completed in 1852, built in memory of her late husband. Located on the plantation property, it was a quarter of a mile north of the future site of the Annandale mansion. After completion, she transferred ownership of the church and surrounding to the newly created Episcopal Diocese of Mississippi. The Chapel was assessed under the Historic American Buildings Survey in the twentieth century and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. A few years later, Mrs. Johnstone hired the architect Jacob Lamour from New York City to design a new mansion for her and her unmarried daughter, Helen. He adapted the design from a plan in Minard Lafever's Architectural Instructor, published in 1856. Construction of the grand three-story, 40-room mansion in the Italianate mode began in mid-1857 and was completed in 1859. It featured one-story arched arcades that encircled the entire structure and spacious interior hallways, providing abundant shade and ventilation. Helen Johnstone was engaged to be married in 1857 to Henry Grey Vick, descended from the founder of Vicksburg. Their wedding was set for May 21, 1859, but Vick was killed in a duel in Mobile, Alabama, on May 17, 1859. Helen later married the Rev. George Carroll Harris, an Episcopal priest, in 1862. During the American Civil War, her mother Margaret Johnstone cared for sick and wounded Confederate soldiers and supplied money and material to the military. Margaret Johnstone died at Annandale on March 16, 1880. The plantation was sold after her death. After many years of George and Helen Johnstone Harris' moving around while he served as an Episcopal priest, the couple built a grand house for their retirement, Mont Helena, in Rolling Fork. Situated atop an ancient platform mound, the two-and-a-half story mansion was built on land left to Helen by her family. The Britton home, Ingleside, burned down in 1906, and Frances Johnstone Britton died on March 24, 1907. Her sister Helen Johnstone Harris died on November 19, 1917. The Annandale mansion, then unoccupied, was destroyed in a fire on September 9, 1924. A Classical Revival-style replacement is at the site of the former mansion. The former plantation is now divided between two communities, Annandale Estates on the west side of Mannsdale Road and Reunion on the east. As golfing communities each has its own golf club, also on the former plantation lands, known as the Annandale Golf Club and the Reunion Golf and Country Club. Folklore Annandale Plantation has two ghost stories associated with it that have been published in at least two books. One, \\"The Ghosts of Annandale\\", in Jeffrey Introduces 13 More Southern Ghosts by Kathryn Tucker Windham details the supposed hauntings. One ghost is claimed in the story to be that of Annie Devlin, a former governess for Helen who died at the Annandale mansion in June 1860 and was purported to haunt its halls until the night it burned in 1924. The other is reportedly that of Helen Johnstone. The story claims that the ghost of Helen now weeps at the grave of Henry Vick, her former fianc√©, in the churchyard of the Chapel of the Cross.

The series was directed by the European University AssociationFormerly known as Standing Conference of Rectors, Presidents, and Vice Chancellors of the European Universities (CRE) and published by Cambridge University Press between 1992 and 2011. The volumes consist of individual contributions by international experts in the field and is considered the most comprehensive and authoritative work on the subject to date. It has been fully or partly translated into several languages.  Synopsis  The first volume is dedicated to the emergence of the university in the Middle Ages and its development until around 1500. Volume II describes and analyzes the university from the Reformation until the French Revolution (1500‚Äì1800), volume III the rise of the modern university until World War II (1800‚Äì1945) and the last volume the post-war period up to the present time. The structure of the book follows a standardized systematic pattern throughout all volumes: the first part (\\"themes and patterns\\") introduces the reader to the university as an institution of its time. The second part deals with the institutional \\"structures\\" of the university, the third with the \\"students\\", their education, activities and careers, and the fourth with individual fields of \\"learning\\" taught in the university. Each section is divided into several chapters which were composed by specialists in the various subjects. The main approach is holistic ‚Äì the book aims less at covering the history of individual universities, but rather the character and historical trajectory of the institution as a whole. As of 2011, the series has been published in full in English and German, while the first volumes have appeared in Spanish and Portuguese and translations into Russian and Chinese are in preparation.Walter R√ºegg (ed.): A History of the University in Europe.

Katz (April 19, 1912, Detroit ‚Äì January 28, 2008, Chicago) was a chemist at Argonne National Laboratory whose fundamental research on the chemistry of photosynthesis led to his election to the US National Academy of Science. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Czarist Russia. Neither parent had any formal education. Education and independent research His college education was in chemistry at the College of the City of Detroit (now Wayne State University). He worked for the next seven years at small companies in Detroit, developing adhesives, metal polishing compounds, lubricants and other specialty chemical formulations used in the automobile industry. While working in Detroit after receiving his bachelor's degree, Katz and several colleagues rented a room in a Detroit office building and used it as a laboratory. They carried out independent research from 1932 through 1939, trying to cure tuberculosis by finding a substance that could dissolve the fatty outer coating of the TB bacillus so that it would be vulnerable to being destroyed by a drug. He and a Detroit colleague published two papers on studies with the bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast-growing and non- pathogenic bacillus with similar physical properties to the tuberculosis bacillus. Unemployed in summer 1939, he followed a suggestion from a former teacher and applied to graduate school in chemistry at the University of Chicago. His thesis research in physical organic chemistry under the supervision of Frank R. Mayo was a study of the mechanism of addition of hydrogen chloride to isobutene in a solvent of low dielectric constant. He received the PhD degree in March 1942. Major publications * G. T.

Until the fifteenth century, Kulubnarti was a remote area. It was one of the last known refuges for Christians in Nubia, while Islam spread to the south. It has been inhabited since the time of the Christian kingdom of Makuria, approximately 1100 AD. Continuously inhabited from the eleventh century to modern times, it is the only Nubian location which has demonstrated through archaeologically investigation a continuous occupation from the Middle Ages to modern history. Kulubnarti has archaeological and anthropological significance because it has been subjected to one of the only systematic excavations of any site along the southern portion of the Nile. The primary motivation for excavation at Kulubnarti was to increase awareness and understanding of the cultural transition from Christianity to Islam in ancient Nubia. Nubia converted to Christianity by the late 6th century and Christianity prevailed as the dominant religion of the region until the 14th century when Moslems gained control of territory south of the 3rd Cataract. Christianity however, persisted into the 15th century in many regions lying north of the 3rd Cataract, including Kulubnarti. Prior to the archaeological study of Kulubnarti, this cultural transition was almost completely unknown archaeologically and only a few historical references were in existence. Geography Kulubnarti is an island located around southwest of Wadi Halfa. It sits just north of the Dal Cataract, which is situated between the 2nd and 3rd Cataracts. The island is in the Batn-El-Hajar region, a rugged, barren, and rocky area. The usual wide zone of alluvial fertile farmland on the banks of the Nile is missing; only small sections of the island are available for agriculture. The population lives mainly in the modern village at the north and south ends of the island. The altitude is about above sea level. There were several villages on this island, with castles, kourfas, houses, and churches. Before building of the Aswan High Dam, Kulubnarti was an island only at the season of the high Nile flood This remains true today in the sense that it is an island only when the level of Lake Nubia (the Aswan High Dam reservoir) is at its peak. Expeditions Johann Ludwig Burckhardt came on his first expedition south of the Nile to the 3rd Cataract in 1813. He was the first to view and describe the abandoned late Medieval era settlement situated on the southern end of Kulubnarti. He published his finds about the island and its small, domed church in his 1819 travelogue Travels in Nubia. The first archaeological investigation was done by Somers Clarke in the early 20th century; he explored Christian building remains along the Nile between Cairo and Soba, publishing his findings in 1912, Christian Antiquities in the Nile Valley. In 1969 and 1979, William Y. Adams led the University of Kentucky team's extensive excavations on the island and the neighboring mainland. There were a total of 19 Kulubnarti sites excavated by Adams and his team. Of the 19 local sites, excavation uncovered 10 settlements, one church, one Christian cemetery, one pottery manufacturing locale, and six rock picture zones. Each of the 19 sites, except for the six rock picture zones, dated to the late medieval period. Approximately 1300 finds were collected and archived. The results showed a continuous history of settlement and exemplified an understanding of the changes in social structures during the gradual transition from the Nubian-Christian empire to the period of Ottoman rule. Additional research groups investigated the cemeteries, including funerary remains. In 1979, a joint expedition between the University of Colorado and the University of Kentucky, led by Dennis Van Gerven, excavated over 400 burials from two cemeteries, one on the island (site 21-S-46) and one on the mainland (site 21-R-2). The island cemetery was initially thought to have been used in the Early Christian period, while the mainland cemetery was used during the Late Christian period. A recent reanalysis of textiles from the cemeteries and radiocarbon dates has revealed that both cemeteries date from the Early Christian period, though parts of the mainland cemetery are still in use by the modern-day villagers. The human remains from Kulubnarti are one of the best-studied bioarchaeological collections in the world and have contributed significantly to scientists' understanding of morphological variation, biological stress, and health and disease in the ancient and developing worlds. Notable landmarks Two notable buildings are the Kulubnarti fort, a fortified house which was converted into a castle, and the 13th-14th century domed Kulubnarti church. Graffito incised into the church building is depicted in three languages, Greek, Coptic, and Old Nubian. East of the fort were four residential buildings of mud brick with stone plinth from the Christian era. There were inscriptions in the western house. Two of the houses had an upper floor, the ground floor being of brick walls and carefully hewn stones. The ceiling on the ground floor rooms consisted of three long, adjacent barrel vaults. Biological Research at Kulubnarti Aside from the work of Adams several other research projects have been undertaken at Kulubnarti. Paul Sandberg provided an isotopic analysis of health and illness between the two cemeteries at Kulubnarti, site 21-S-46 and site 21-R-2. Another study conducted by Kilgore et al. assessed the Kulubnarti sample for evidence and prevalence of traumatic injury. Kilgore et al. found that when compared to other comparative samples, two from North America and two from Europe, Kulubnarti demonstrated a higher prevalence of healed fractures, proportionately greater rates of multiple injuries and severity of injury was generally higher at Kulubnarti. The high prevalence of trauma and the severity of the injuries were largely attributed to the uneven and treacherous terrain in the Batn-El-Hajar. Ancient DNA analysis of subadult specimens from these burial sites found that the mainland samples predominantly carried European and Near Eastern mtDNA clades, such as the K1, H, I5, and U1 lineages; only 36.4% of the mainland individuals belonged to African-based maternal haplogroups. By contrast, 70% of the specimens at the island burial site bore African-based clades, among which were the L2, L1 and L5 mtDNA haplogroups. In 2015, Sirak et al. analysed the ancient DNA of a Christian-period inhabitant of Kulubnarti. The scientists found that the medieval specimen was most closely related to Middle Eastern populations. The adults interred in the Kulubnarti cemeteries have been the subject of skeletal population genetics analyses focused on framing their relationship with other Nubian groups and select Egyptian samples. Both Kulubnarti cemeteries show some isolation from other Nubians and Egyptians, suggesting genetic drift at the site, which is a common finding when analyzing Nubian groups. Moreover, the S and R cemeteries plot separately in biological distance graphs, demonstrating some genetic differentiation between the island and mainland. An analysis of the biological distances examining Lower Nubian Christian period samples, only, demonstrated the adults in both Kulubnarti cemeteries cluster with the other samples, indicating broad genetic homogeneity among the Lower Nubian sites. Further, the genetic differentiation between the Kulubnarti cemeteries suggests the S cemetery did not have family areas and that unrelated adult individuals may be interred there, but they were not genetically different from individuals in the greater region. The results from a reanalysis of textile and architectural data discounted socioeconomic differences between the two cemeteries explaining any genetic differentiation and instead pointed to the cemeteries potentially being used by the monastery at site 21-S-10 and underscored the need to re-date the material to confirm or reject this hypothesis. Moreover, the S cemetery was shown to potentially be special-use for subadults as the odds of being interred in the S cemetery, as opposed to the R cemetery, were over 6-fold higher for infants and nearly 3-fold higher for other individuals under age 18, as compared to adult females (values were similar for males). It cannot be discounted the monastery and/or other inhabitants preferred to use the S cemetery to bury subadults. Finally, Kulubnarti has also been utilized as a comparative sample to assess cross ‚Äìcultural discrepancies in health, stress, disease, violent interaction and mortality levels throughout Sudanese Nubia. Archaeological findings at Kulubnarti The excavation of Kulubnarti, organized by Adams, was completed under the auspices of the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia. The main objective of the research team working at Kulubnarti was to clearly outline the cultural transition from Christianity to Islam using archaeological methods. Upon examination, the churches at Kulubnarti were all Christian in form and none of the structures showed evidence of being converted to a mosque. In fact, no mosques were uncovered in Kulubnarti, suggesting that the religious transition was not readily apparent from a study of the architectural remains. In similar vein, the artifactual remains also provided only minimal evidence of the transition from Christianity to Islam. The artifactual evidence of the cultural transition came in the form of several Islamic texts. The most informative aspect of Kulubnarti, pertaining to the religious conversion, was uncovered in the cemeteries of Kulubnarti. The two cemeteries excavated at Kulubnarti clearly yield evidence of both Christian and Muslim graves. None of the graves could be dated to identify a more precise time for the religious conversion at Kulubnarti. Further excavations of two Early Christian period (AD 550-800) cemeteries at Kulubnarti, one located on the mainland (R) and the other on an island (S), revealed the existence of two reportedly socioeconomically distinct local populations. However, recent research reanalyzed the evidence presented by Adams and Adams and showed looking at textile types concurrently, rather than individual frequencies as in Adams and Adams, revealed there are no socioeconomic differences. Additionally, the settlement (21-S-40) attributed to the S cemetery and cited as evidence of low socioeconomic status (SES), dates to centuries after the S cemetery. Similarly, the church attributed to the S cemetery at Kulb West dates to centuries later than the S cemetery, and was originally connected to a small settlement nearer to the church than the S cemetery. The biological evidence also does not support claims of socioeconomic differences. See also *Ifri n'Amr or Moussa *Kelif el Boroud *Luxmanda *Naqada References Further reading *Adams, William Y.

Early career Prior to running for office, Johnson served as an administrative assistant to Taunton Mayor Theodore J. Aleixo, Jr. and as Director of the Taunton Housing Authority. Mayor of Taunton In 1981, incumbent Mayor Joseph Amaral chose not to seek re-election and Johnson ran to succeed him. He finished first in the preliminary election with 4289 votes, defeating Amaral's administrative assistant Walter Precourt Jr. (2776 votes), City Councilman Tijuana Goldstein-Star (2729 votes), recent Syracuse University graduate David Goren (262 votes), and rock musician Russell N. Hurst (76 votes). He defeated Precourt in the general election 7266 votes to 6030. During Johnson's first term, the city suffered economic misfortune as Parker Brothers and Paragon Gear shut down their Taunton plants. Although the city suffered through an economic slump and high unemployment during Johnson's early years as mayor, by 1987 unemployment in Taunton was at the lowest point on record. In 1986, GTE chose Taunton as the location for its new plant. In 1989, The Pyramid Companies announced plans to build a mall in Taunton, which would become the Silver City Galleria. In 1990, Johnson prevented hip hop group 2 Live Crew from performing in Taunton, stating that he wanted to protect his community from the potential for violence and from the band's \\"outward display of immorality\\". In 1991, Johnson was defeated in his bid for a sixth term, losing to Robert Nunes 6922 votes to 6741. City Manager of Lowell Shortly after his defeat, Johnson was chosen by the Lowell City Council to serve as City Manager. In 1992, Lowell lost control of its budget to the state finance commission due to its unstable financial condition. It regained control in 1995. That same year, the City Council approved bond sales for the Tsongas Center and Edward A. LeLacheur Park.

'A classroom revolutionary' (The Guardian, 3 March 1994); Myra Barrs, 'Professor James Britton' (Gazette Independent, 10 March 1994); Nancy Martin 'An intellectual adventurer' (Times Educational Supplement, 11 March 1994); Gordon M. Pradl 'In Memory of Jimmy Britton', (English Education, May 1994).  Biography  Britton was born in Scarborough, England, on 18 May 1908. He graduated with a B.A. honours degree in English from University College London, where he held the Campbell Clarke Scholarship and the John Oliver Hobbes Memorial Scholarship. From 1933‚Äì1938, he taught English at Harrow Weald County Grammar School, in the state educational system. In 1938, Britton left his teaching post to become education editor for the publishers John Murray of London. Soon afterwards, he joined the Royal Air Force in World War II. Record and Recall: A Cretan Memoir (1988) details an episode in his war experiences when he escaped being captured by German paratroopers who invaded the island of Crete where he helped to staff a radar station in 1941. Returning from overseas, Britton worked at John Murray for several years before completing his M.A. at the University of London. From 1948‚Äì1952 he also taught education at the Birmingham College of Art. In 1954, Britton joined the English Education Department at the University of London Institute of Education where he spent the rest of his career, becoming Reader in Education, head of department, and eventually the Goldsmiths Professor. During the 1970s, he headed a major research group (including colleagues Nancy Martin and Harold Rosen) for the British Schools Council, which examined the instructional role of writing in the British Schools. This led to the publication of The Development of Writing Abilities, 11‚Äì18 in 1975 and the refinement of his theory of language use, which distinguished between participant and spectator language roles. This work helped teachers to see the importance of having students use expressive language and foregrounded the crucial role of audience in the development of language abilities. At this time, Britton was also an active member of the Bullock Committee, which issued its influential report, A Language for Life, in 1975. Britton's classic study Language and Learning (1970; 2nd Ed., 1992), contains his most fully developed statement about the relationship between children's active language use and their learning. Drawing on extensive samples of actual speech and writing done by his two daughters when they were growing up (Celia Britton, formerly Professor of French, University of Aberdeen, Scotland, and Alison Britton, one of England's leading ceramic artists), Britton showed how individuals use words to make both practical and moral sense of the world. He also helped to introduce, and make accessible, important psychological thinkers in the area of language, identity, and society, from the American George Kelly to the Russian Lev Vygotsky. In 1982, his selected essays appeared in Prospect and Retrospect; and finally, with his last academic book Literature in Its Place (1993),Hardy, Barbara , 10 September 1993, Secret life of books, (review of Literature in Its Place in Times Educational Supplement). Britton focused on the importance of poems and stories in people's lives. Owing to his wide international reputation, Britton served as a visiting scholar in numerous institutions around the English-speaking world. In 1963, he worked with teachers in South Africa and later in Australia to advise and consult. In Canada, he was especially associated with the University of British Columbia, the University of Calgary, and the Ontario Institute of Education. In the United States, he spoke at numerous National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) conferences and held many visiting professorships, notably at Bread Loaf Writers' Conference and New York University. The University of Calgary awarded him an honorary LL.D., and he received NCTE's David H. Russell award in 1977 for Distinguished Research in the Teaching of English. A collection, The Word for Teaching Is Learning, was published in 1988 to honor his eightieth birthday. In addition, the Conference on English Education recognises Britton's important influence on English teachers throughout the world by annually selecting a winner of the James N. Britton Award for Inquiry in English Language Arts. Britton also worked hard at establishing professional networks for teachers of English. In 1947, he helped found the London Association for the Teaching of English (LATE), which eventually led to the founding of the National Association for the Teaching of English (NATE) in the UK in 1963. His commitment to helping initiate and sustain an international conversation among teachers of English began with his role as a member of the British delegation to the Dartmouth Conference of 1966.Dixon, John. (1967). Growth through English. Oxford: Oxford University Press. In 1971, at the University of York, Britton was a key supporter of the first grassroots International Conference with its call for language and writing across the curriculum. In 1984, he edited English Teaching: An International Exchange for the International Federation for the Teaching of English (IFTE). See also *Clare Winnicott Bibliography * Britton, J. (1963).

Biography Fran√ßois Marie was born in Alba, Piedmont, in 1698. He was nephew to the reigning Duke of Modena and Reggio, Francesco III d'Este. His mother was Felicite De Canapan, and his father was Rinaldo de Reggio, Chevalier de Reggio, who was the brother of Duke Francesco, and son of Duke Rinaldo d'Este. When his father died, Francois himself became the Chevalier de Reggio. He ruled his lands strongly for many years, but fell victim to boredom. Looking for excitement, Francois moved to France, joined the French army, and fought in the War of the Austrian Succession with his close friend, the Duke of Richelieu. He proved to be an excellent soldier, and went on to distinguish himself greatly at the Siege of Bergen op Zoom. King Louis XV of France was so impressed by the Chevalier's valour during the siege, that he gave him a captaincy in the French army, and promoted him to the rank of Captain general. Soon after his promotion in 1747, the king sent Marie to Louisiana, which was a French colony at the time. Fran√ßois held the title of Captain-General of Louisiana until 1763, when the Spanish Empire took over the French colony. The Chevalier was well liked by the new Spanish officials, and was given a new title in the government of Spanish Louisiana: First Justiciary of the Estates and Property of the Crown. While holding this position, he met a young woman, by the name of Fleuriau. They married, and had many children. In his old age, Francois retired, and died in New Orleans, in 1787.

Set during Italy's tumultuous anni di piombo (\\"Years of Lead\\"), the film obtained a great commercial success.  Cast  *Enrico Maria Salerno as Commissioner Bertone *Mariangela Melato as Sandra *Franco Fabrizi as Francesco Bettarini *Cyril Cusack as Former Superintendent Stolfi *Mario Adorf as Deputy Prosecutor Ricciuti * Laura Belli as Anna Maria Sprovieri * J√ºrgen Drews as Michele Settecamini * Corrado Gaipa as Lawyer Armani Plot Commissioner Bertone is an upright officer in a Rome over-run by crime. Due to a justice system which protects the rights of suspects and citizens against the police, many crimes go unpunished with convictions not being obtained the criminals ending up back on the streets. However, some of the released criminals turn up dead. Bertone discovers an organized group of vigilantes are dealing with the criminals the police cannot obtain convictions for. A young criminal on the run after a bungled robbery costs the lives of two citizens is the syndicate's next victim, followed by an older criminal. The vigilantes start to target prostitutes and homosexuals active on the streets at night, as well as a trade union leader who was accused of killing a policeman during a riot, and even a criminal in custody. Bertone tries to bring the second kid involved in the robbery to justice legally, but the self-appointed executioners are closing in and his own officers are sympathetic to the 'clean up squad'. Style Italian film historian Roberto Curti stated that many critics have consider Execution Squad to be the initiator of the \\"poliziottesco\\" film genre. Curti opined that Execution Squad was just a logical continuation of Damiano Damiani's Confessions of a Police Captain. The film is credited to Stefano Vanzina, the first time in his career that Vanzina had abandoned his usual credit of Steno which he had used since 1949. The film is also a drastic change from Steno's usual output which consisted primarily of comedy films. Production The script and story were written by Lucio De Caro and Steno. Steno stated that the script was originally written for a different director, but \\"back then my colleagues were afraid to speak ill of the police\\". The lead role in the film was given to Enrico Maria Salerno, but was originally offered to Lando Buzzanca, one of Italy's most famous comedians at the time. The film was shot at Centro Incom in Rome and on location in Rome. Release Execution Squad was released in Italy on 25 February 1972 where it was distributed by P.A.C. It grossed a total of 1,696,360,000 Italian lire on its domestic release. Curti described the film as an unexpected box office hit in Italy. It was released in West Germany on 17 November 1972 as Das Syndikat.

The show ran during the tenure of head coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant from the 1958 through the 1982 seasons. Co-hosted by John Forney (1961‚Äì1965), Bill Austin (1966), Charley Thornton (1967‚Äì1981) and Steadman Shealy (1982), The Bear Bryant Show was a cultural phenomenon within the state of Alabama that contributed to the rise in popularity and awareness of the university's football program during the 1960s and 1970s. The show ran for an hour during its entire run. History Memorabilia on display at the Bryant Museum during its \\"Sundays at Four\\" exhibit. As part of Bryant's contract with the University, he retained all of the rights to Alabama football game films. As such, he became one of the first collegiate football head coaches to have his own television program with the start of The Bear Bryant Show in 1958. Bryant was paid $3,000 per show and insisted on it being an hour long in order to cover the game in its entirety and for its perceived recruiting benefits. In 1966, the show became one of the first television shows produced in the state of Alabama to be broadcast in color. During the 25-year run of the program, several persons served as its co-host alongside Bryant. From the 1961 through 1965 seasons, the show was co-hosted by former Alabama broadcaster John Forney. Bill Austin, Sports Director of WCFT-TV Tuscaloosa co-hosted the 1966 season, Charley Thornton was later brought on as co-host and served alongside coach Bryant through the 1981 season. At the conclusion of that season, Thornton left Alabama to become an executive athletics director at Texas A&M; University. In September 1982, former Crimson Tide quarterback Steadman Shealy was selected to serve as the co-host for the show. The announcement was made by the producer of the program, Sloan-Major Advertising. The show ended at the conclusion of the 1982 season with the retirement of Bryant as head coach of the Crimson Tide. During its run, over 250 episodes were produced and for several years the show was one of the highest-rated syndicated television shows in the country. Although over 250 episodes were produced, only 77 episodes survive on tape. So few recordings of the show remain as a result of both the show being aired live, and many of the videotapes used to record the show in the 1970s being reused week-to-week. Many of the tapes that date back to the 1970s were recorded at the request of the father of former Alabama halfback Mike Stock, so he could watch highlights of his son with the Crimson Tide. In 1992, Golden Flake and Coke donated the 77 surviving episodes to the Paul W. Bryant Museum, and in 2001 an exhibition that featured the show called \\"Sundays at Four\\" opened at the Bryant Museum. Efforts to re-release the show on DVD have been discussed at various times, but have yet to yield fruit. Sponsors The title sponsors of the show were the Birmingham Coca-Cola Bottling Company and Golden Flake Snack Foods. Their slogan was \\"a great pair, says the Bear,\\" and each episode opened with Bryant and his co-host opening a bag of Golden Flake potato chips and bottles of Coca-Cola. Legacy Culturally, the show reflected many of the values of the state not only in the way Bryant spoke about the game, but also in how he spoke about God, family and country. The ability of Bryant to connect with the fan base through the show helped to both \\"create and sustain the legend of Bear Bryant\\" as observed by Keith Dunnavant. During the 1960s and 1970s, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules prohibited teams from appearing in more than two televised games on ABC per season. As such, The Bear Bryant Show became the primary way that fans of the Crimson Tide from across the state were able to see the games. For years, the show aired on Sundays at 4:00 p.m., and its popularity regularly caused many of the stations that carried it to preempt live coverage of National Football League games during the same timeslot. In addition to providing the fans a way to see highlights from the weekly games, the show was also watched by Crimson Tide players to see what coach Bryant had to say about their individual performances.

The path is 7 kilometres (4.3 miles) in length. The Greenlink project was established in 2005, and was part of a 3-year partnership between many organisations, such as North Lanarkshire Council, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Commission Scotland. The route The path begins at the Bothwellhaugh Roman Fort in Strathclyde Country Park, and travels through the woodland area of the park, going over the West Coast Main Line. The path then goes through Bellshill golf course and along the south- east of the town, then travelling over the South Calder Water and the A721. It by-passes the Forgewood suburb of Motherwell heading towards Braidhurst High School, and subsequently travels under the Argyle Line heading towards the new site of the Cathedral Primary School and Fir Park nursery joint campus. The path concludes when it runs through the residential housing area and stops at the Aquatec sports centre next door to the town centre. Future Plans Cycle path at Strathclyde Country Park There are plans in future to extend the cycle path beyond Motherwell town centre to connect to the new town of Ravenscraig. The initial plans prior to formation of the path was to create a direct route from Strathclyde Park to the site of the former Ravenscraig steelworks. Those plans were put on hold due to the delay in the regeneration of Ravenscraig, and so the link only stops at Motherwell town centre. Awards In 2011, the cycle path received the Level 3 It's Your Neighbourhood award from Beautiful Scotland for developing.

Both sides take, lose, and retake a border village countless times during the entire movie. The village is taken and retaken by both sides so many times that the locals don't even pay attention to the battles any more and openly collaborate with whichever side is occupying the village at that time.

External signs of the disease may or may not be present. The internal blackening develops in plants exposed to environmental pathology such as drought conditions or poor soil.  Blossom-end rot  Blossom-end rot is another sign of plant disease that may accompany blackheart in the same plant. A black rot originates opposite the stem area of the plant fruit (the \\"blossom-end\\") and spreads over the fruit as a dark, hardened area. The causes of blossom-end rot and blackheart are the same.  Causes and treatment  The most common cause of blossom-end rot and/or blackheart is exposure to a prolonged hot, or drought period. These plant pathologies may also be caused by an extremely low calcium mineral content in the soil. Plant fruit that is afflicted by either blossom-end rot or blackheart should be picked and discarded, leaving the healthy fruit on the plant. While the condition is not contagious and it will not spread from fruit to fruit, removing affected fruit will enable the plant to concentrate strength towards the healthier parts of the plant. Additional water should be added to a plant suffering from the effects of a hot, dry spell. If low calcium in the soil is the cause, this can be treated with calcium-rich fertilizers, such as gypsum, limestone, or ground eggshells.

The island is situated between the 2nd and 3rd cataracts of the Nile, about southwest of Wadi Halfa, in the Batn-El-Hajar region. History Somers Clarke published a sketch in 1912 of the island's church, its walls made of mud bricks. It was fully excavated and recorded by the anthropologist William Yewdale Adams in 1969, and plans and elevations prepared by Friedrich Hinkel. Adams and Peter Grossmann date the church to the 13th or 14th century, Adams having dated pottery finds in the church to that period, and Grossman concurring with the dating on the basis of stylistic comparisons. Greek, Coptic, and Old Nubian language graffito was incised within the church. The church paintings, described by Adams in his 2011 book, were moved to the National Museum of Sudan in Khartoum. Architecture The small building has an almost square area. It is typical in all respects of the Late Christian Church Type 4d, having a rectangular rather than an apsidal sanctuary, and eastern corner rooms entered only from the aisles, not from the sanctuary. At the west end there is a staircase in the southwest corner room, but no corresponding room at the northwest corner. There was probably though not certainly a tall cupola over the center of the nave. Entrance, as in all Nubian churches, is through the north and south walls near the western end. There are three pairs of narrow slit windows high in the eastern wall, and two widely separated slit windows in the east and west walls. The entire building consisted of mud bricks with a single layer of rough stones at ground level.Adams 2009, 348-10. On the interior walls, fairly well preserved remains of two layers of murals were found in the east end of the sanctuary and in both aisles, but not in the eastern corner rooms. Recognizable designs included a Nativity, a figure of Christ Pantocrator flanked by the Disciples, an archangel, and a head of Christ within a tondo, with the symbols of the Four Living Creatures projecting from it. The murals were conserved in 1970 and are now partly on display in the Sudan National Museum. Otherwise the church remains largely as it was when excavated, for it is above the level of waters impounded by the Aswan High Dam. References Further reading *William Y. Adams, Kulubnarti I, 69-77.

Grant on 2 July 1872. 915-916 (Charles J. Kappler, ed., 1904). In 1892, Congress opened up part of the reservation to white settlement.. 441-443 (Charles J. Kappler, ed., 1904). In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson, with Congressional authorization, opened up more reservation land for settlement.. 966-969 (Charles J. Kappler, ed., 1929). =Lower courts= Seymour was charged with burglary in Okanogan County, Washington and pleaded guilty to attempted burglary. He was sentenced to 7-1/2 years in the state penitentiary. While incarcerated, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Washington Supreme Court. The state Supreme Court denied the petition on the grounds that the offense did not take place in \\"Indian country\\".In re Seymour v. Schneckloth, 55 Wash. 2d 109, 346 P.2d 669 (Wash. 1959). Indian country is defined in federal law as including all land within an Indian reservation, and within Indian country, only the Federal government has jurisdiction over crimes committed by Indians.., A Revisionist History of Indian Country, (1997)., 24 (1969). The court reasoned that the Congressional action that had opened the Colville Indian Reservation to settlement had reduced or diminished the size of the reservation and since the crime was committed outside of the diminished reservation, it was not in Indian country. The court denied the writ. Seymour then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the appeal and granted a writ of certiorari. Opinion of the court Justice Hugo Black, author of the unanimous opinion =Arguments= Glen A. Wilkinson argued the case for Seymour. Washington Assistant Attorney General Stephen C. Way argued the case for the state of Washington. At the request of the court United States Solicitor General J. Lee Rankin filed a memorandum with the court. =Unanimous opinion= Justice Hugo Black announced the opinion of a unanimous court. Black looked to the statutes that affected the Colville Indian Reservation and noted that the 1892 act expressly reserved the southern half for use of the tribes under control of the federal government. The 1916 presidential proclamation merely set forth the procedure for settlement, and neither the proclamation nor the enabling act had any language terminating the reservation., The Legacy of Solem v. Bartlett: How Courts have used Demographics to bypass Congress and Erode the Basic Principles of Indian Law, (2009). Black further noted that a 1956 statute. 750-751 (Charles J. Kappler, ed., 1971). recognized the continued existence of the reservation, and a 1953 statute. 591-592 (Charles J. Kappler, ed., 1971). explained how the state could obtain jurisdiction once certain conditions were met. Black observed that those conditions had not yet been met. The statutes opening up the reservation to settlement merely allowed non- Indians to move onto the reservation and did not end reservation status., 178-181 (1982). Black stated that \\"Since the burglary with which petitioner was charged occurred on property plainly located within the limits of that reservation, the courts of Washington had no jurisdiction to try him for that offense.\\" The case was reversed and remanded to the Washington Supreme Court.

A seventh victim died of his wounds in 2020. Page committed suicide by shooting himself in the head after he was shot in the hip by a responding police officer. Page was an American white supremacist and Army veteran from Cudahy, Wisconsin. Apart from the shooter, all of the dead were members of the Sikh faith. The incident drew responses from President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Dignitaries attended candlelight vigils in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and India. First Lady Michelle Obama visited the temple on August 23, 2012. Incident Following emergency calls around 10:25 a.m. CDT, police responded to a shooting at a Sikh gurdwara located in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. On arrival, they engaged the gunman, later identified as Wade Michael Page, who had shot several people at the temple, killing six. Page wounded an officer; after being shot in the stomach by another, he fatally shot himself in the head. He was armed with a 9mm Springfield XD(M) semi-automatic pistol. Page had legally purchased the gun in Wisconsin. Four people were killed inside the temple, and three people, including Page, died outside. Page killed five men and one woman, ranging in age from 39 to 84. Three men were transported to Froedtert Hospital, including one of the responding officers. Initial reports said the gunman had died from being shot by police officers at the scene, but the FBI later clarified that Page, after being shot by an officer, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Authorities released an audio recording of the incident, during which the first responding officer, Lieutenant Brian Murphy, was shot by the gunman. It contained the words \\"I have someone walking out the driveway towards me. Man with a gun, white t-shirt\\", followed by the sound of gunfire. In September 2012, authorities released video recordings taken by squad cars during the incident, including the moments when Murphy was shot, and the gunman being shot by another officer. Murphy was shot fifteen times by Page, but survived. The temple was preparing langar, a Sikh communal meal, for later in the day. Witnesses suggested that women and children would have been at the temple preparing for the meal at the time of the incident, as children's classes were scheduled to begin at 11:30 a.m. The Joint Terrorism Task Force investigated the site, and Oak Creek police chief John Edwards said his force treated the incident as a \\"domestic terrorism incident\\" in \\"the beginning stages of this investigation\\". Oak Creek police handed the investigation over to the FBI. They also investigated possible ties to white supremacist groups and other racial motivations. The FBI said there was no reason to think anyone else was involved in the attack, and they were not aware of any past threat made against the temple. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder described the incident as \\"an act of terrorism, an act of hatred, a hate crime\\". Victims The six victims killed included one woman: Paramjit Kaur, 41; and five men: Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65, the founder of the gurdwara; Prakash Singh, 39, a Granthi; Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; and Suveg Singh, 84. All of the male victims wore turbans as part of their Sikh faith. Four of the victims were Indian nationals, while the rest were Americans. The injured included a responding officer, Lt. Brian Murphy, who was shot fifteen times at close range, including once in the face and once in the back of the head. He was discharged from the hospital on August 22, 2012. Sikhs for Justice, a New York-based group, pledged a $10,000 award to Murphy. Two Sikh residents of Yuba City, California donated another $100,000 to officer Murphy and praised his bravery. Included among the injured was Baba Punjab Singh, a Sikh Priest who was shot in the head. He was left partially paralyzed from the wound for more than seven years and died on Monday, 2 March 2020. Perpetrator Wade Michael Page (November 11, 1971 ‚Äì August 5, 2012) was an American white supremacist living in Cudahy, Wisconsin. Page was born and grew up in Colorado. He served in the U.S. Army from April 1992 through October 1998, In the Army, Page had learned to repair the Hawk missile system, before becoming a psychological operations specialist. He was demoted and received a general discharge for \\"patterns of misconduct,\\" including being drunk while on duty and going absent without leave. After his discharge, Page returned to Colorado, living in the Denver suburb of Littleton from 2000 through 2007. Page worked as a truck driver from 2006 to 2010, but was fired after receiving a citation for impaired driving due to drinking. Page had ties to white supremacist and neo- Nazi groups, and was reportedly a member of the Hammerskins. He entered the white power music scene in 2000, becoming involved in several neo-Nazi bands. He founded the band End Apathy in 2005 and played in the bands Definite Hate and Blue Eyed Devils, all considered racist white-power bands by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Page's former step-mother apologized to the Sikh victims and said she had not been in touch with her stepson for the past twelve years, after divorcing his father. A former friend described him as a \\"loner\\" and said he had talked about an \\"impending racial holy war\\". According to his neighbors, Page lived alone, rarely left his apartment, and avoided eye contact with them. Page legally purchased the handgun used in the shooting on July 28, 2012, at a gun shop in West Allis, Wisconsin. Page passed the background checks required, and paid cash for the gun, along with three 19-round magazines. The owner of the gun shop said that Page's appearance and demeanor in the shop \\"raised no eyebrows whatsoever\\". Following the shooting, photographs of Page appeared in media reports showing him with a range of tattoos on his arms and upper body, which were said to show his links to white supremacist organizations. Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards declined to speculate on the motive behind the attack, saying \\"I don't know why, and I don't know that we'll ever know, because when he died, that died with him what his motive was or what he was thinking.\\" Reactions President Barack Obama offered his condolences, calling the Sikh community \\"a part of our broader American family,\\" and ordered flags at federal buildings flown at half-staff until August 10 to honor the victims. Obama called for \\"soul searching\\" on how to reduce violence. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and other officials also issued statements of sympathy for the victims of the shooting and their families.Pols React To Sikh Temple Shooting In Wisconsin Daily News (New York), August 6, 2012. Retrieved August 7, 2012 Nancy Powell, the United States Ambassador to India, attended prayers for the victims at Gurudwara Bangla Sahib in New Delhi. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the attack being at a Sikh temple added to the pain, and stated that India stood in support of all peace-loving Americans who condemned the shooting. Following the incident, there were vigils as well as some protests against the United States by Sikhs in India. On August 9, Indian members of parliament in New Delhi joined ranks in parliament to offer condolences to families of the victims. Jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh, the highest-ranking priest within the Sikh faith, called the shooting a \\"security lapse\\" by the U.S. government, and recommended that Sikhs in the United States adopt all possible security measures at their temples. Oak Creek Sikh residents said the incident had shocked their community. Many Sikh Americans did not approve of the protests in India against the United States, and strongly condemned the actions, such as flag-burnings, taken by the protesters. U.S.-based Sikh community groups pledged assistance to the victims and their families, and urged Sikh Americans to organize interfaith vigils. They also organized to send an emergency response team to Wisconsin. Many other Americans held candlelight vigils in support of the Sikh community, and dignitaries such as Governor Walker attended. Congressman Paul Ryan introduced a bill in Congress condemning the tragedy which stated the House \\"condemns the senseless attack\\". On September 19, 2012, a Congressional hearing addressed hate crimes in response to the tragedy, before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights convened by Senator Dick Durbin. In the aftermath of the shooting, Amar Kaleka, the son of Satwant Singh Kaleka, became involved in politics, supporting gun control and new legislation to reduce hate crimes. Kaleka criticized Obama, who visited the sites of other mass shootings, but not the Sikh Temple. As a member of the Democratic Party, Kaleka ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for the United States House of Representatives in in the 2014 election.

The furniture is made of clay and was executed by the artist in 1969-1970. The California Clay Movement (or American Clay Revolution) was a school of ceramic art that emerged in California in the 1950s. The movement was part of the larger transition in crafts from \\"designer-craftsman\\" to \\"artist-craftsman\\". The editor of Craft Horizons, New York-based Rose Slivka, became an enthusiastic advocate of the movement. Peter Voulkos Peter Voulkos was one of the movement's driving forces. He established the Ceramic Center at the Los Angeles County Art Institute (now the Otis College of Art and Design), where he created massive, abstract ceramic sculptures. He felt that his free-form ceramic works were like jazz compositions: improvisational and free spirited. Voulkos began creating ever larger ceramic works to break away from the conventional arts and crafts of his day. Some of his work, named \\"plates\\", \\"ice buckets\\" or \\"tea bowls\\", were \\"deconstructed\\" traditional forms of glazed pottery. Others, such as his \\"stacks\\", were non-utilitarian and purely sculptural. During a career that lasted almost half a century, Voulkos made over 200 \\"stacks\\", some as much as in height. Writing about the clay movement in 1963, a reviewer in Time said \\"Peter Voulkos' rough, ragged monuments are powerful weapons against the slick coffee-table pottery that often passes for modern art, and already a generation of fierce West Coast individualists has joined him at the barricades.\\" Pupils Voulkos profoundly influenced John Mason, Kenneth Price and Paul Soldner. Voulkos turned the Los Angeles County Art Institute into an important center for ceramic art between 1954 and 1959. Moving to the University of California in Berkeley he and sculptors such as Sidney Gordon and Harold Paris developed an influential school of sculpture. His pupils included Kenneth Price, Billy Al Bengston, Robert Arneson, Nancy Selvin and Stan Bitters. The work of Voulkos, Arneson and others typified Californian art in the 1950s and 1960s, and was featured in many exhibitions. Stephen De Staebler was another influential sculptor working mostly in clay and bronze who has been associated with the California Clay movement. A reviewer said of him that \\"He practically invented his own art form by beating and buckling tons of clay into awesome mountainous landscapes, but his human sculptures are also very moving.\\" Michael Frimkess is another master of the California clay movement. Frimkess was a student of Peter Voulkos, and adopted the abstract expressionist style of sculpture taught by Voulkos. In 2014, Frimkess received the Career Achievement Award from the Hammer Museum.Jessica Gelt, \\"Hammer Museum announces winners of 2014 Made in L.A. Mohn Awards\\", Los Agenels Times, 18 August 2014., Influence Voulkos had huge influence, not just on potters and sculptors but even on painters. Awareness of the movement quickly spread. In 1959 the Guyanese artist Donald Locke obtained a grant to study for a master's degree in fine arts at Edinburgh College of Art, a school in the University of Edinburgh. There he met the artists Dave Cohen, Sheldon Kaganof and Dion Myers, who introduced the ideas of the California Clay Movement to Britain. For many years his work reflected their influence.

Roosevelt and entered Missouri at the foot of Cardiff Hill which appeared in Twain's books The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. A crosswalk crossed the highway, connecting the Twain boyhood home with the lighthouse at the top of the hill. It originally carried the two-lane U.S. Route 36, but with the extension of Interstate 72 west across Missouri, a new bridge was needed and was built to the north of the original bridge. On the Missouri side, the bridge ran into downtown Hannibal, just north of Hill Street. On the Illinois side, the route connected to present-day Illinois Route 106 (Old US 36), now served by I-72's Exit 1 to go east to Hull, Pittsfield, and points beyond. The Mark Twain Bridge was initially a toll bridge.Missouri 1940 Highway Map Replacement In the late 1990s, construction started on a new bridge to carry I-72 west into Hannibal (I-72 turned into I-172 at milepost 4). Increased traffic on the deteriorating, old, narrow bridge was also a contributing factor. After the new bridge opened in 2000, the bridge was demolished.

She won six of her thirteen races, including the Listed Flower of Scotland Stakes and Kilvington Stakes, as well as being placed in the Group 3 Ballyogan Stakes. Since retiring from racing she has become one of Juddmonte Farms' top broodmares, foaling the undefeated, 10-time Group 1 winner Frankel. All of her first five foals have won races, including the Group winners Bullet Train and Noble Mission. Kind was trained by Roger Charlton and owned by Khalid Abdulla. Background Kind is a bay mare who was bred by Juddmonte Farms and foaled on 21 April 2001. She was sired by Danehill who won the Haydock Sprint Cup in 1989. He went on to become a leading sire and was champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Danehill also sired Danehill Dancer, Dansili, Duke of Marmalade, Dylan Thomas, George Washington and Rock of Gibraltar. Kind's dam is Rainbow Lake, a daughter of Rainbow Quest. Rainbow Lake won three of her six starts, including the Ballymacoll Stud Stakes and Lancashire Oaks. Kind was trained by Roger Charlton. Racing career =2003: Two-year-old season= Kind made her racecourse debut on 5 September 2003 in a six-furlong maiden race at Kempton Park. She was slowly away at the start, but ran on strongly in the closing stages to finish in third place, about two and a half lengths behind winner Unshooda. One month later Kind started as the odds-on favourite for another six-furlong maiden at Newmarket. She was slowly away again and finished fourth, four lengths behind winner Valjarv. =2004: Three-year-old season= In her first start as a three-year-old, on 14 April 2004, Kind stepped up in distance for a seven-furlong maiden at Newmarket. This time she got away from the start well and led the group that was racing on the far side of the course. She was overtaken near the finish and finished third, with the race being won by the filly Relaxed. On 22 May, Kind returned to Kempton Park, where racing against colts for the first time, she started as the odds-on favourite. She took the lead and went clear, with the other horses being unable to challenge her. Kind won the race by six lengths from Farewell Gift. Eleven days later she won again at Kempton, this time beating Swinbrook by a head over six furlongs. Racing at Kempton Park for the fourth time in her career on 23 June, Kind recorded her third successive victory. This was in the Williamhillradio.com Classified Stakes, where after tracking the leaders in the early stages, she took the lead with one furlong still to run and won by half a length from Celtic Thunder. In July Kind raced in her first Handicap, the Vibe FM Fillies' Rates Stakes at Newmarket. As with her previous race, she followed the front runners and took the lead one furlong out, this time winning by a short-head from Valjarv. In her final race as a three-year-old, she stepped up in class for the Listed Flower of Scotland Stakes at Hamilton. The pre-race favourite was Enchantment, who had finished fourth in her two previous runs in Listed races. Kind was priced at 8/1. Ridden by regular jockey Richard Hughes, she raced near the front of the field of eleven, just behind the leaders, in the early stages and took the lead inside the final furlong. She won the race by half a length from Autumn Pearl, with Frascati a further three quarters of a length behind in third place. =2005: Four-year- old season= Kind started the 2005 season in the Landsdown Fillies' Stakes at Bath, where she finished third behind winner Indian Maiden.

It was the location of the Qing Empire's detention of Sun Yat-sen, an important episode in the Chinese revolution of 1911. It remains today the focal point for events relating to China held in the United Kingdom, including celebrations in 2012 to commemorate 40 years of diplomatic relations between the UK and the People's Republic of China.Remarks by H.E.

In addition, there are Chinese consulates- general in Manchester, Edinburgh and Belfast.

There has been a Falun Gong protester sitting opposite the embassy for many years; this is referenced in the novel Saturday by Ian McEwan. Despite 2013 rumours that the embassy was to move from Portland Place to a new development in Nine Elms, in 2018 the Chinese government purchased Royal Mint Court with plans to develop the site for a new embassy building.  History  The Chinese Legation in London was established at 49 Portland Place in 1877 by the Qing Empire, becoming China's first permanent overseas diplomatic mission. As part of the settlement of the Margary Affair, the Qing Empire was required to send an Imperial commissioner to London to apologise in person to Queen Victoria. Guo Songtao, Deputy Minister of Arms, was appointed Minister to Britain and Minister to France in 1876 and sent to London. Guo arrived at Southampton on 12 January 1877. In preparation for his arrival, James Duncan Campbell, non-resident secretary of the Chinese Imperial Customs Service and head of its London office, leased 49 Portland Place, and the Chinese Legation was officially established on Guo's arrival in London on 7 February 1877. Kidnapped in London: Sun Yat-sen publicised his imprisonment in the Chinese Legation for political effect in this widely read pamphlet. The legation was the location of the detention of Sun Yat-sen, an important episode in the lead-up to the Chinese revolution of 1911. Sun's detention sparked a major diplomatic incident, but he was eventually released with the help of his friend James Cantlie. After the 1911 revolution, the Republic of China was established on 1 January 1912 and was recognised by the British government as the legitimate government of China on 6 October 1913. The Republic of China government took over the building from the Qing government, and extended the lease on No. 49 in 1924. In 1926, the Chinese government leased the adjoining 51 Portland Place as well, and obtained a 999-year lease on both No. 49 and No. 51. In 1935, the level of Chinese diplomatic representation in Britain was upgraded, and the Chinese Legation became the Chinese Embassy. After the revolution of 1949, the UK government for a short time continued to recognise the Republic of China as the legitimate government of China, but in 1950 switched recognition to the People's Republic of China, which inherited the buildings. British authorities agreed to a Chinese request to demolish the buildings and rebuild them as a single building with a sympathetic fa√ßade in 1973. The buildings were demolished in 1980, rebuilding took place between 1983 and 1985. The new building, while sympathetic to the original, retains only one doorway in place of the two doorways of the two houses it replaced.Chinese Embassy in London ‚Äì About the Embassy Building  Controversy  On 3 June 2014, members of staff at the Chinese embassy in London reacted angrily when people arrived to lay flowers to mark the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Wang Ti-Anna, the daughter of an imprisoned democracy activist and another women were shoved, their flowers thrown away, and they were shouted at by a member of staff, before calm returned to the scene.

It depicts the King dressed in ancient Roman attire and riding bareback. The sculpture was originally designed to sit on top of the Marble Arch at the entrance to Buckingham Palace, but was placed in its current location following the King's death. History Model of John Nash's original design for Marble Arch, featuring the statue of George IV on top of the arch Sir Francis Leggatt Chantrey originally designed the statue to stand on top of Marble Arch in its original position as the entrance to Buckingham Palace, following architecture work by John Nash. Edward Blore took over the work, and his redesign to reduce costs removed the Chantrey statue. Chantrey's work was funded by George IV himself, rather than by public subscription. The statue was cast in 1828. George IV died in 1830, and the statue was placed on an empty plinth in Trafalgar Square in December 1843, which was expected to be on a temporary basis, however it has remained there ever since. It was unveiled to little ceremony, with The Times describing it as \\"somewhat suddenly erected\\". It was the first statue erected on one of the pedestals, which were installed three years earlier with architect Charles Barry expecting them to be filled by groups of statues. An inscription was added towards the end of the 19th century as the public were no longer aware of whom it portrayed. The journalist Janice Turner questioned the need for a statue of George IV in Trafalgar Square in 2005; in rebuttal Lord Baker of Dorking argued that the monarch still deserved the statue due to his town planning legacy which remained in London. In 2012, the milliner Stephen Jones created crowns for both George IV and his horse to be added to the statue as part of the \\"Hatwalk\\" art project sponsored by the Mayor of London; in the project 21 milliners created new hats for famous statues around London.

Buxtorf explained to Gai that he himself was the translator, and sent him a copy of his dissertation \\"Diatribe\\" as a present. Gai wrote another letter to Buxtorf in Latin with a Hebrew introduction drawing his attention to works of which Buxtorf was unaware. Buxtorf subsequently commissioned Gai to purchase Hebrew books for him. Gai insisted particularly on obtaining Buxtorf's lexicons, as he planned to write a lexicon in collaboration with a cleric to whom he was giving Hebrew lessons.
