Using a variety of spices, blended with the fresh vegetables, meat and fish. Part of Indonesian cuisine, it demonstrates indigenous traditions, as well as influences from other Indonesian regional cuisine, Chinese and Indian. The island's inhabitants are predominantly Hindu and culinary traditions are somewhat distinct with the rest of Indonesia, with festivals and religious celebrations including many special foods prepared as the offerings for the deities, as well as other dishes consumed communally during the celebrations. Rice, the primary grain is almost always consumed as a staple accompanied with vegetables, meat and seafood. Pork, chicken, fruit, vegetables and seafood are widely utilized, however just like most Hindus, beef is never or rarely consumed. Bali is a popular tourist destination, and the area has many cooking schools with daily courses of Balinese cuisine. Night markets, warungs (food stands), and fruit vendors sell local delicacies. Festivals include ornately prepared foods as part of the celebrations. As a popular tourist area, many westernized foods are also available as well. Ingredients Pasar pagi, morning wet market selling fruits and vegetables in Ubud. Steamed rice is commonly consumed in every meal. Pork, chicken, seafood and vegetables are widely consumed.

Nevertheless, lesser Gusti (nobles) and common Balinese people might consume beef, albeit rarely. Spices include Kaempferia galanga (galangal), shallots, garlic, turmeric, ginger and Kaffir lime are used in Balinese cuisine. Balinese 8-spice is made with white pepper, black pepper, coriander, cumin, clove, nutmeg, sesame seed, and candlenut. Palm sugar, fish paste, and basa gede (a spice paste) are used.

Traditions, serving and outlets A warung in Bali. In Hindu Balinese traditions, certain foodstuffs are served in religious rituals, used as an offering for gods. During religious ceremony, festively decorated fruits and foodstuff are brought to the temple as an offering. Balinese believed that certain foodstuff is an appropriate offering for certain deities. For example, pork is favoured by Batara Kala, while ducks are favoured by Hindu gods, such as Brahma. Certain rare foodstuff such as turtle meat is also used in rituals. Balinese households usually purchase fresh ingredients from the local market every morning, cook and serve them in the late morning to be mainly consumed for lunch. The leftovers are stored to be heated again for family dinner. Other than homemade family dishes, Balinese cuisine are served from humble street side carts and warungs, to fancy restaurants in resorts and five-star hotels. Small family-run warungs are the budget options for street food, serving everything from family dishes for full meals, or snack foods. Balinese warungs or restaurants usually specified on certain menu, for example there are restaurants that specialized on solely serving babi guling (suckling pig), bebek betutu (crispy duck), or nasi campur (Balinese mixed rice). Some warung specialized on selling tipat cantok (similar to kupat tahu) or nasi jinggo mixed rice.

He surrendered the city of Santiago de Cuba on July 17, 1898, after the Siege of Santiago.

The region was in the midst of a mining boom, but Toral's family had a long history of military service. He entered the Academia General Militar at the age of 10, and served in the administrative branch of the Spanish Army. He saw active duty from the 1840s to the 1870s, serving domestically as well as in colonial posts during insurrections. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1889. In 1895, he was appointed the commander of the garrison of Madrid, which provided security for government buildings and officials as well as ceremonial troops for various functions.Konstam, Angus. San Juan Hill 1898: America's Emergence As a World Power. Osprey Publishing, 2013, p. 17. In late 1895, Toral volunteered for duty in Cuba. He was assigned to the Spanish Army garrison in Guant√°namo, where he performed his duties during the Cuban War of Independence. When the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out in April 1898, Lieutenant General Arsenio Linares y Pombo requested that Toral become his deputy at the garrison at Santiago de Cuba. Linares established a military commission to establish defenses for the city, and appointed Toral to this body. Afterward, Toral was assigned command one of two divisions that made up IV Corps‚Äîthe unit commanded by Linares which defended Santiago de Cuba.Pierpaoli, Jr., Paul G. \\"Toral y V√°squez Jos√©.\\" In The Encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars: A Political, Social, and Military History. Spencer Tucker, ed. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2009, p. 644. =Battle and surrender at Santiago de Cuba= On July 1, 1898, Linares was wounded in the Battle of San Juan Hill. Toral was named temporary commander of IV Corps. Toral inherited a poorly executed defense: Of the more than 6,000 troops at his command, Linares had dispatched 500 to hold the heights at El Caney and more than 1,000 to hold the harbor entrance. But just 1,200 of the remaining 4,000 soldiers had been sent to hold San Juan Heights ‚Äî the defensive key to the city.Walker, Dale L. The Boys of '98: Theodore Roosevelt and the Rough Riders. New York: Forge, 1999, p. 230-231. After the defeat at San Juan, most of the defenders pulled back within the city limits. The United States Navy had cut the telegraph cables to Guant√°namo on June 7,Hansen, Jonathan M. Guant√°namo: An American History. New York: Macmillan, 2011, p. 97. so Toral sent a messenger to Brigadier General F√©lix Pareja Mesa asking for reinforcements. Mesa never received the message. Early in the morning on July 3, U.S. Major General William Rufus Shafter asked Toral to surrender. Toral refused. Hours later, Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete's Atlantic Squadron attempted to leave Santiago de Cuba's harbor and was destroyed by the U.S. Navy's Flying Squadron and North Atlantic Squadron, commanded by Commodore Winfield Scott Schley.Tucker, Spencer C. \\"Santiago de Cuba, Naval Battle of (July 3, 1898).\\" In U.S. Leadership in Wartime: Clashes, Controversy, and Compromise. Vol. 1. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2009, p. 405-406. Shafter contacted Toral again late on July 3, and asked for his surrender a second time. Shafter warned him that the city would be bombarded on July 5 without it. Toral continued to negotiate, trying to buy time. On July 8, Toral offered to surrender ‚Äî but only if he would be permitted to withdraw his men and arms to the town of Holgu√≠n. Shafter, his V Corps decimated by disease and suffering from the extreme heat, poor supplies, poor sanitation, and poor housing,Sweetman, Jack.

But President William McKinley, consulted on the situation, demanded unconditional surrender.Keenan, Jerry. Encyclopedia of the Spanish- American and Philippine-American Wars. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2001, p. 382-382. Shafter warned Toral that bombardment of Santiago de Cuba would happen on July 10 unless he surrendered, and Toral again declined the request. U.S. Navy and U.S. Army troops shelled the city beginning at 4:00 P.M. on July 10 and ceased at 1:00 P.M. on July 11. Toral held his ground and continued to negotiate. Shafter offered to send all Spanish prisoners of war to Spain at American expense and allow Toral to evacuate his men and arms if the Spanish commander surrendered. Meanwhile, General Ram√≥n Blanco y Erenas, commander of all Spanish forces in Cuba, pressured Toral to surrender to spare the city further shelling. The Spanish government in Madrid was also pressing Toral to surrender. Toral declined to do so. But the Americans cut the water supply to the city and conditions for the civilian population deteriorated rapidly. General Toral unconditionally surrendered his remaining men at Santiago de Cuba, the 12,000 men at Guant√°namo, and six other small Spanish Army garrisons throughout Cuba on July 17, 1898. The surrender effectively ended land combat in Cuba for the duration of the war.Marley, David. Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict in the Western Hemisphere, 1492 to the Present. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 603-604. Concerned with his post-war reputation, Toral successfully demanded that the word \\"capitulation\\" rather than \\"surrender\\" be used in all documents and that his men be allowed to retain their weapons. Post-war life On July 22, the government of Spain requested peace terms from the United States.Fernandez, Ronald. The Disenchanted Island: Puerto Rico and the United States in the Twentieth Century. Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 1996, p. 3.

Vol. 2. Spencer C. Tucker, ed. Santa Barbara, Calif. : ABC-CLIO, 2013, p. 1177. Toral departed for Spain on August 15, 1898, under the terms of the Protocol of Peace. The Spanish people, however, blamed him for the collapse of the Spanish military effort in Cuba and his arrival was met with public demonstrations. Some of these were violent. In the city of Vigo, the crowd threw stones at him.\\"General Toral Dead.\\" Sacred Heart Review. 32:3 (July 16, 1904), p. 1. Accessed 2013-06-29. Toral was tried before a court- martial for surrendering Santiago de Cuba. He was defended by Juli√°n Su√°rez Incl√°n, and acquitted on August 9, 1899. Public attacks on his character and behavior continued frequently throughout the rest of Toral's life. He became depressed and slowly went insane. A few months before his death, he was placed in a psychiatric hospital in Carabanchel, a suburb of Madrid. He died there on July 10, 1904.

Foundations The congregation was founded at the initiative of Father Francis Mary of the Cross Jordan, founder of what was to become the Society of the Divine Savior, commonly known as the Salvatorians, as the female community of the Society. Jordan invited a young woman, Amalia Streitel (1844-1911), then a Carmelite nun in Germany, who had already been a Franciscan teaching Sister, to move to Rome to lead this effort. She left Germany for Italy, where she received the religious habit of the new Society and the religious name of Mother Frances of the Cross on 16 February 1883. She arrived to find that the housing Jordan had procured for her was an apartment lacking furniture and cooking utensils. As she was joined by other women, the Sisters took in orphans of the city, caring for them in their own apartment. Differences in vision arose between the two and in 1885, the Sisters separated from the Salvatorians. The 36 women who formed the community then went under the authority of the Diocese of Rome and were given the name by which they are now known. The congregation took the Rule of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis at that time, combining a life of service with that of contemplation. To support themselves, the Sisters provided home nursing care and worked in the sacristy of the Church of Santa Maria della Piet√† in Camposanto dei Teutonici, the German national church of Rome. In 1890 Streitel arrived in the United States at the request of the Bishop of Wichita in Kansas, that the congregation take over a hospital there which was faltering. From there they expanded to Wisconsin, where they established a number of hospitals. A health resort was later opened in Denville, New Jersey, and a mission was opened in Oklahoma. Final approval of the congregation was received on 6 March 1911 by Pope Pius X, the same day that Streitel died in Castel Sant'Elia, Italy. Current status Today the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother serve in Italy, Austria, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Germany, the United States, Grenada, St. Lucia, Tanzania and Trinidad and Tobago.

He played in the Cuban National Series, for the Cuban national baseball team, and in 2014 for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). Professional career =Cuban baseball career= Gonz√°lez pitched for La Habana in the Cuban National Series from 2007 through 2009. He played for the Cuba national baseball team in the 2009 World Port Tournament and 2009 and 2011 Baseball World Cups. He was playing for the Artemisa team when he was caught trying to defect in January 2012 and he was suspended from playing in the league at that point. He succeeded in defecting from Cuba to El Salvador in 2013, and then moved to Mexico. =American baseball career= Gonz√°lez pitched in some games for the Toros de Tijuana of the Liga Norte de M√©xico as a showcase for American scouts, including those from the Los Angeles Dodgers, Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs. On July 26, 2013, stories in the press reported that Gonz√°lez agreed to a six-year contract with the Philadelphia Phillies, worth $60 million. However, the Phillies never confirmed the report and subsequent reports mentioned that the deal might not happen. On August 30, 2013, the Phillies announced they had signed Gonz√°lez to a three-year, $12 million contract with a vesting option for 2017. Philadelphia Phillies in 2015 Spring Training Entering spring training, it was still unknown whether he would be a member of the big league starting rotation, bullpen, or whether he would start the season with the Phillies Class AAA affiliate, the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. Ultimately, he opened the season on the 60-day disabled list (DL) \\"after not exactly impressing in a poor spring\\"; the official reason for his placement on the DL was \\"right shoulder tendinitis\\". Upon returning from injury, Gonzalez ascended through the Phillies' minor league system on a rehab assignment, compiling 54 strikeouts in innings pitched. Used primarily out of the bullpen in his rehab stint, Gonzalez completed his minor league assignment with a 3.11 earned run average (ERA) and .231 opponent batting average. Deemed healthy and ready to begin his MLB career, Gonzalez was activated and assigned to the Phillies on September 2 as part of the roster expansion call-ups. He recorded a 6.75 ERA in innings pitched in the major leagues. Philadelphia Phillies in 2015 Spring Training A poor spring training in 2015 led to the Phillies outrighting Gonz√°lez to the minor leagues and removing him from the 40-man roster. He was released by the Phillies on April 1, 2016. Death Gonz√°lez was killed in a traffic accident in Havana, Cuba, on November 23, 2017.

Martian Watches allow for hands-free use of mobile phones via short distance wireless communication. Using Bluetooth and voice recognition technology, users can take calls, listen to or send text messages, see caller ID information, and send text using speech synthesis. The Martian watch is reportedly the first watch to utilize voice commands. Features Martian Watches were produced in several styles, each with an analog time display, a small OLED display screen, a speaker, and a noise-cancelling microphone. The small OLED displays scrolling text which can show caller ID information, text messages, and other information such as social media notifications. In addition, the watch can be used to trigger the shutter of the mobile phone's camera. The watches utilize Bluetooth 4.0, which supports regular Bluetooth, as well as Bluetooth low energy. The analog watch portion of Martian Watches is powered by a watch battery, and there is a side-mounted micro USB port for the rechargeable battery that handles the phone functions, in addition to an accelerometer. Awards Martian Watches was named a CNET \\"Best of CES Finalist\\" at CES 2013, and was selected for a Popular Mechanics CES 2013 Editor's Choice Award. In addition, the Edison Award for Productivity Tools was awarded to Martian Watches in April 2013. Kickstarter campaign Martian successfully launched their wireless smartphone-connected watches via the Kickstarter crowd funding platform on August 16, 2012, and the first watches were delivered to customers in early February 2013. A new Kickstarter campaign in 2018 has resulted in significant customer complaints, with users either not receiving their goods or receiving watches which do not work as advertised. The company has so far not responded to customer criticism and it seems that the Martian office phones are cut off, with support tickets also going unanswered. Update (May 23, 2018): Martian issued a statement to Kickstarter backers saying that after shipping the first batch of about 480 watches, they lack the funding to continue. They tried to acquire more funding to cover their costs (amounting upwards of $15,000,000) but they were unable to get funding. They are closing the company and liquidating their assets to pay investors. They will be issuing another update to Kickstarter backers in about 30 days, when they decide what they will do to repay their debts and issue refunds to their backers. Many backers are angry at their lack of financial planning as they greatly mislead users by setting a $30,000 goal and raised over ten times this amount, yet they are $15,000,000 short of fulfilling the orders. As this goes against Kickstarter terms of service by not providing a product or a refund, users await their next update in the coming months. SilverPlus SilverPlus, Inc., the U.S. distributor of Martian Watches, was established in 2007 by CEO Jeffrey Hsieh and CTO Dennis Kwan. The president of the company is Stan Kinsey. =Other products= In 2011, SilverPlus launched a home communication safety system for seniors called the SilverCare Personal Safety Alert Device that included a two-way voice communication watch/pendant and a base station connected to a home telephone line. The unique digital watch had a microphone and speaker that allowed the wearer, when within 100 feet of its base station, to call for help and speak to 9-1-1, family members, or a caregiver. In August 2014 it was revealed that Martian was teaming up with Guess to launch a range of branded smartwatches. In May of 2017, the company has reported that it filed for bankruptcy for failing to obtain ade- quate investors. We were very excited, like you, about the potential of Martin G2 watches. Unfortunately, we can not obtain the total investment needed to complete the project. We needed more funds to complete the remaining units without completing. We tried to find new funds from venture capitalists, private equity firms and a principal investor for a large round of financing of $ 15 million, but they were not successful. We tried to license our G2 intellectual property as a turnkey solution for other companies, but unfortunately the discussions took too long and we ran out of time. We also contacted our current investors, who previously lent $ 1.5M as convertible notes to the company, but declined to put in additional funds. As such, we recently completed all operations. We do not have enough liquid assets to pay all of our debts at this time. Our intention is to liquidate the remaining assets for distribution to creditors on a pro-rata basis. First, we need to determine the total number of creditors, the amount of your claims, the priority of certain groups of claims and then the best way to sell and realize the value of the company's remaining assets, which consist primarily of intellectual property rights, including patents related to the Martian Watch brand. We expect that approximately 30 days will elapse to develop the best way to proceed, at which time we will update it in the following steps.\\" https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/martianwatches/mvoice-g2-worlds-first- watch-with-voice-and-full-d/posts/2159639 Closure On 24 May, 2018, it was announced that Martian Watches will cancel the mVoice G2 product and permanently cease operations after 11 years in business due to financial troubles.Martian Watches goes out of business External links *Official site References Category:Watch brands Category:Watch manufacturing companies of the United States Category:Manufacturing companies established in 2007 Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 2018 Category:Bluetooth Category:Smartwatches Category:Ubiquitous computing ","title":"Martian Watches"},{"id":"39813813","text":"Asthena albidaria is a moth in the family Geometridae.

Second-language acquisition (often abbreviated to SLA) also refers to the scientific discipline devoted to studying that process. Second language refers to any language learned in addition to a person's first language, including the learning of third, fourth, and subsequent languages. It is also called second-language learning, foreign language acquisition, and L2 acquisition.  What is second-language acquisition?  Second-language acquisition can be described as all of the following: * Language acquisition - process by which humans acquire the capacity to perceive and comprehend language, as well as to produce and use words and sentences to communicate. Language acquisition is one of the quintessential human traits, because nonhumans do not communicate by using language. * Academic discipline - branch of knowledge that is taught or researched at the college or university level. Also called a field of study. Disciplines are defined (in part) and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong. A discipline incorporates relevant knowledge, expertise, skills, people, projects, communities, problems, challenges, studies, inquiry, approaches, and research areas. * Branch of science - systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. \\"Science\\" also refers to a body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied.  Branch of social science - academic discipline concerned with the society and the relationships of individuals within a society, which primarily rely on empirical approaches. * Branch of linguistics - scientific study of human language.  Branch of applied linguistics - interdisciplinary field of study that identifies, investigates, and offers solutions to language-related real-life problems. Some of the academic fields related to applied linguistics are education, linguistics, psychology, computer science, anthropology, and sociology. * A form of language education - teaching and learning of a foreign or second language. Language education is a branch of applied linguistics.  Branches of second-language acquisition  * English as a second or foreign language - use or study of English by speakers with different native languages. It is also known as English for speakers of other languages (ESOL), English as an additional language (EAL), and English as a foreign language (EFL). * Chinese as a foreign language - study of the varieties of Chinese by non-native speakers. * Spanish as a second language - teaching and learning of Spanish for those whose mother tongue is not Spanish, particularly immigrants, tourists, indigenous peoples and refugees. * Etc.  Related fields  * Teaching English as a foreign language -  Learning objectives: language skills  * Foreign-language vocabulary - * Linguistic competence - * Linguistic performance - * Language fluency - * Language proficiency - * Multilingualism -  Bilingualism -  Second-language acquisition resources  = Second-language acquisition methods and activities = * Extensive listening - similar to extensive reading, it's the analogous approach to listening. One issue is that listening speed is generally slower than reading speed, so simpler texts are recommended. * Extensive reading - large amount of reading, to increase unknown word encounters and associated learning opportunities by inferencing. The learner's view and review of unknown words in specific context will allow the learner to infer and thus learn those words' meanings. * Intensive reading - slow, careful reading of a small amount of difficult text ‚Äì it is when one is \\"focused on the language rather than the text\\". * Language immersion - teaching and self-teaching method in which the second language is the medium of instruction, with no use of primary language allowed. All educational materials and all communication are in the second language. * Paderborn method - learn a simple language first, such as Esperanto, and then the target second language. Saves time by making the second language easier to learn. * Vocabulary acquisition - = Second- language acquisition tools = * Dictionary - collection of words in one or more specific languages, often listed alphabetically, with usage information, definitions, etymologies, phonetics, pronunciations, and other relevant information.  Mono-lingual dictionary - dictionary in a single language. A mono-lingual dictionary in the language being acquired assists the reader in describing words (and thinking about the language) in the language's own terms.  Bilingual dictionary - also called a translation dictionary, is a specialized dictionary used to translate words or phrases from one language to another. * Unidirectional bilingual dictionary - lists the meanings of words of one language in another * Bidirectional bilingual dictionary - presents translation to and from both included languages.  Talking dictionary - some online dictionaries and dictionary programs provide text-to-speech pronunciation.  Visual dictionary - dictionary that primarily uses pictures to illustrate the meaning of words. Each component within each picture is labeled with its name. Visual dictionaries can be monolingual or multilingual. Visual dictionaries in the language being acquired are especially useful in language immersion approaches. * Media in the target language  Books * Audio books  Encyclopedias * Wikipedia (see language editions list)  Music * Lyrics (to read along) (see ColorSounds)  Videos * Movies * TV shows  Websites * Subtitles -  Closed captioning - * Word lists by frequency - lists of a language's words grouped by frequency of occurrence within some given text corpus, either by levels or as a ranked list, serving the purpose of vocabulary acquisition.  History of second-language acquisition  History of second-language acquisition  Second-language acquisition phenomena  * Second-language attrition - decline of second- language skills due to lack of use or practice of the second language and/or lack of exposure to it. * Code-switching - switching between two or more languages, or language varieties, in the context of a single conversation. * Communication strategies in second-language acquisition * Interlanguage - * Second-language phonology - * Silent period - stage in second language acquisition where learners do not attempt to speak. Silent periods are more common in children than in adult learners, as there is often more pressure on adult learners to speak during the early stages of acquisition. = Factors affecting the learning of a second-language = * Individual variation in second-language acquisition - * Foreign language anxiety * Language-learning aptitude - aptitude measurement via tests, the results of which correlate with how well the test takers will succeed at picking up a new language. Language aptitude test include:  Modern Language Aptitude Test - mainly authored by John B. Carroll, for adults, mainly used by government and military institutions to select employees for language training  Defense Language Aptitude Battery - developed and used by the United States Department of Defense to select candidates for jobs that will require them to attain fluency in a foreign language  Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery - authored by Paul Pimsleur, used to assess the language learning aptitude of students in grades 7 to 12  Modern Language Aptitude Test ‚Äì Elementary - mainly authored by John B. Carroll, designed to test children in grades 3 to 6  Cognitive Ability for Novelty in Acquisition of Language - Foreign - developed by Grigorenko, Sternberg, and Ehrman in 2000, using a new concept of language aptitude as a theoretical base * Motivation in second-language learning - * Willingness to communicate - students willing to communicate in the second language learn how, those who are not willing, not so much. * Metalinguistic awareness -  Hypothesized success factors  * Acculturation model - hypothesis in which effectiveness in acquiring a second language is due in part to how well the learner acclimatizes to the culture (and members) of the target language. The greater the social and psychological distances of the learner from the members of the target culture, the fewer opportunities he or she will have to learn the language. * Input hypothesis - * Interaction hypothesis - the development of language proficiency is promoted by face-to- face interaction and communication. * Comprehensible output hypothesis - * Competition model - posits that the meaning of language is interpreted by comparing a number of linguistic cues within a sentence, and that language is learned through the competition of basic cognitive mechanisms in the presence of a rich linguistic environment. * Noticing hypothesis - concept proposed by Richard Schmidt, which states that learners cannot learn the grammatical features of a language unless they notice them.H.S. Venkatagiri, John M. Levis \\"Phonological Awareness and Speech Comprehensibility: An Exploratory Study\\" Language Awareness.

The Beaver Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. History Close up on north tower The bridge was bid on December 19, 1947 to Pioneer Construction Company of Malvern, Arkansas. The construction foreman who led the project was M.R. Blair (1914-2014), who later served as lead foreman on numerous bridge and highway projects across Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee, and who led the construction of numerous dams, highways and bridges throughout the southwestern United States, including the 1964 Big I interchange of Interstates 25 and 40 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Remarkably, Mr. Blair and his team completed the project without the benefit of an industrial crane, using only a pickup-mounted, knuckle-boom type crane. Since the construction was coincident with the building of Table Rock Dam, completion was delayed until 1949 as the United States Army Corps of Engineers required the bridge to be raised . Upon completion, the bridge remained a vital link for the citizens of Beaver until its closure for major deck rehabilitation in 1981. Further rehabilitation occurred in 2003. The bridge has a 10-ton weight limit. The bridge was temporarily closed for inspection in October 2018 after two overweight buses crossed it.

On May 28, 2012, the third album Serdtsa v Atlantide was released. On September 15, the band organized a concert which featured four vocalists: Sergey Sergeev, Alexander Cap, Andrey Nefyodov and Mikhail Nakhimovich. It was not certain if one of these would become the new frontman. In July 2013, it was announced that the band had found a new frontman, but his identity remained a secret. It was assumed that the band would resume performing at new concerts in the Fall of 2013. Style and lyrical themes Grand Courage's style mostly resembles heavy metal with elements of power metal. Their songs contain themes such as human emotions (love, sorrow, hate, etc.), relationships, mythology, history, war, politics, and patriotism. Mikhail Bugaev, the band's primary songwriter, often draws inspiration from literature and films. For example, the song \\"Teoriya khaosa\\" (\\"–¢–µ–æ—Ä–∏—è –•–∞–æ—Å–∞\\", \\"Theory of Chaos\\") is based on the movie The Butterfly Effect. War as a theme appears in songs like \\"Te, kogo ryadom net\\" (\\"–¢–µ, –∫–æ–≥–æ —Ä—è–¥–æ–º –Ω–µ—Ç\\", \\"Those Who Are Not Around\\"), a song dedicated to those who died in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War), and \\"Na voyne\\" (\\"–ù–∞ –≤–æ–π–Ω–µ\\", \\"At War\\"), a song in memory of the veterans of World War II.

The document advocated the abolition of the Jewish sacrifices, esteemed James, the brother of Jesus as the leader of the Jerusalem church, and denigrated Paul of Tarsus as a Gentile and an opponent of Jewish Law. A Jewish Christian source document thought to be embedded within the Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions (1.27 or 1.33‚Äì71) and conventionally referred to by modern scholars as the Ascents of James may be related to the otherwise lost work mentioned by Epiphanius.

Paul is portrayed as a \\"certain hostile person\\" who prevents James from converting the Jewish people to Christianity (1.70.1‚Äì8). The text recounts the salvation history of Israel from Abraham to Jesus from a Jewish Christian perspective.

The last designs were proposed in 1944 towards the end of the Third Reich.Jean-Denis Lepage, Aircraft of the Luftwaffe, 1935-1945: An Illustrated Guide Except for the last one, all the aircraft designs were to be powered by pulse jets, the same engines used in the V-1 flying bomb. None of the Messerschmitt P.1079 projects saw mass-production and the pulsejet-powered fighter program was scrapped in December 1944, although Junkers continued developing its model until the last days of the war.Junkers EF 126 - Luft'46 History The P.1079 Messerschmitt designs span from 1941 to 1944, the latter being the year in which the High Command of the Luftwaffe took to call attention to the need of a strong defense against the devastating allied bombing raids, with its Emergency Fighter Program. Since pulsejets were cheaper to build, the possibility of using them to power aircraft was explored, owing to the overstretched industry and materials shortages of the Third Reich at that stage of the war. Thus the main German aircraft manufacturers were asked by the Luftwaffe to produce light fighter designs (Miniaturj√§ger), using a strict minimum of materials that would be fitted with one Argus As 014 pulsejet engine per unit. The projected planes were small, spartan creations, with no landing gear, no radio and almost no electrical equipment, but the mostly propaganda-based aim was to produce them cheaply and in large numbers so as to overwhelm the Allied bomber formations that flew daily over Germany's skies.Ulrich Albrecht: Artefakte des Fanatismus; Technik und nationalsozialistische Ideologie in der Endphase des Dritten Reiches All the P.1079 Messerschmitt designs remained on paper, but Junkers built the Ju EF 126 Ellie the only pulsejet-powered fighter project that reached the prototype stage right before the end of the war. For this venture Heinkel would use a He 162 airframe, powered by a pulse jet and Blohm & Voss submitted the Blohm & Voss P 213 At any rate the Argus pulsejets proved themselves unsuitable for manned aircraft that would have to take off unassisted, for they did not produce enough power at low speeds for takeoff. Since additional launch schemes would have to be added to the project, such as towplanes, aircraft catapults or rocket boosters, the goal of the program would be defeated and expenses would be far higher than projected. Thus the pulsejet-powered fighter project never saw mass production, being brought to a close already before 1945. The last of the Messerschmitt variants, the 1944 Me P.1079 51 project, used a ramjet instead of a pulsejet. But eventually ramjets were also dropped in favor of turbojets towards the end of the Third Reich. A further variant, the Me P.1079 18 Schwalbe, appears in some publications.Messerschmitt P.1079/18 Schwalbe But this \\"experimental aircraft\\" is a widely publicized hoax, not a real Messerschmitt project. Variants All of the Me P.1079 variants were small planes and none of them would have been able to take off unassisted. All projected aircraft were provided with retractable skids for landing.Jean-Denis G.G.

In Italy, discussions on \\"poetic theology\\" were articulated most notably by Boccaccio and Petrarch, both of whom promoted a philosophical life capable of withstanding the inquisitorial scrutiny of theological orthodoxy.Stanley Meltzoff. 1987. Botticelli, Signorelli and Savonarola: \\"Theologia Poetica\\" and Painting from Boccaccio to Poliziano. Firenze: S. Olschki. The Italian appeal to poetic theology finds its historical consummation in the works of Giambattista Vico, and most notably in his Scienza Nuova (1730 and 1744), where the political philosopher highlights the independence of pre- philosophical poetic theologians (\\"authors of gentile nations\\") from Biblical revelation, and thus too, Christianity's sacred history.G. B. Vico, Scienza Nuova (1744), \\"Of the Method,\\" final paragraph. Vico argues at length that the \\"authors\\" (autori) of civil society preceded by far its \\"writers\\" (scrittori), so that a problematic hiatus separates the two, as it does things and the records we have of them in words. Vico's enterprise consists of discovering the inherence of order in things‚Äîand of \\"right in human nature\\"‚Äîlest order and right be conceived as merely imposed upon things by \\"writers\\" according to their whims (a placito), as is the case with all dogmatic theology, but also‚Äîso argues Vico already in his De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia‚Äîwith modern \\"science,\\" insofar as it identifies what is true with what is \\"most certain\\" (certissima).De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia, Ch. I.1. While Vico's references to \\"poet theologians\\" (poeti teologi) point overtly to pre- philosophical authorities, Vico presents himself, if only tacitly or obliquely, as a poet theologian in his own right. In this respect, as Paolo Cristofolini Paolo Cristofolini, \\"Da Dante a Omero, Da Gravina a Vico,\\" in 2007. Giambattista Vico e l'Enciclopedia dei saperi. A. Battistini and P. Guaragnella, eds. Lecce: Pensa Multimedia. has shown, Vico recognizes himself as a \\"new Dante,\\" or a poet theologian who is at once a philosopher. Vico's own Scienza Nuova presents itself‚Äîmost notably in the first and last paragraphs of the work‚Äîas discovering the providence of a \\"metaphysical\\" human mind in the world of human wills (animi umani). If our own intellect (intelligenza) is at work in us prior to our recognizing it (indeed even when we live as brutes),G. B. Vico, Scienza Nuova (1744), \\"Of the Method,\\" par. 1-2. philosophy too must \\"covertly\\" precede sensory experience as the hidden author of our world (hence Vico's dictum, included in his De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia, Ch.

Their bodies were discovered on August 20, 1966, and the cause of their deaths has never been determined. Events On the afternoon of August 20, 1966, a young boy was flying a kite on the Morro do Vint√©m (Vint√©m Hill) in Niter√≥i, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, when he came upon the bodies of two deceased males and reported them to the authorities. The Morro do Vint√©m had difficult terrain, and the police were unable to reach the bodies until the next day. When a small team of police and firefighters arrived, they encountered an odd scene: the bodies rested next to each other, partly covered by grass. Each one wore a formal suit, a lead eye mask, and a waterproof coat. There were no signs of trauma or any evidence of a struggle. Next to the corpses, police found an empty water bottle and a packet containing two wet towels. A small notebook was also identified, on which were written the cryptic instructions, ('16:30 be at the specified location. 18:30 ingest capsules, after the effect protect metals await signal mask'). The two men were identified as Manoel Pereira da Cruz and Miguel Jos√© Viana, two electronic technicians from Campos dos Goytacazes, a town several kilometers to the northeast of Rio de Janeiro. Following an investigation, police reconstructed a plausible narrative of the men's last days. On August 17, Cruz and Viana left Campos dos Goytacazes with the stated intent that they needed to purchase some materials for work. The two men then boarded a bus to Niter√≥i, and arrived at 2:30 pm. Evidence shows that the waterproof coats were purchased at a shop there, and one bottle of water from a local bar. Upon being interviewed, the waitress from the bar described Miguel as \\"very nervous,\\" and noticed he frequently checked his watch. That is the last time they were known to have been seen alive; it is presumed they went directly from the bar to the spot at which they were discovered. No obvious injuries were discovered at the scene, nor later at the autopsy. A search for toxic substances did not occur. The coroner's office was very busy at the time and, when the autopsy was finally conducted, the internal organs of the two victims were too badly decomposed for reliable testing.According to a 2004 TV special: Linha Direta Justi√ßa ‚Äì M√°scaras de Chumbo Theories There are multiple theories that have been proposed to explain this case, ranging from foul play to UFOs. One theory revolves around the testimony of a friend of the two men, who claimed that they were members of a group of \\"scientific spiritualists\\". The men were apparently attempting to contact extraterrestrials or spirits using psychedelic drugs. Believing that such an encounter would be accompanied by blinding light, the men cut metal masks to shield their eyes and may have died of drug overdoses. This account is corroborated by the esoteric diary entry found at the scene and by mask-making materials and literature concerning spirits found at the men's homes.

He composed romances, a symphony, and an opera and was an amateur singer, violinist, and patron of the arts. Vielgorsky was a friend of Ludwig van Beethoven and an admirer of his music; the Russian premiere of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony took place at Vielgorsky's home in Saint Petersburg in 1836. The same year, Mikhail Glinka rehearsed parts of his new opera A Life for the Tsar at Vielgorsky's home, accompanied by the enserfed orchestra of Prince Yusupov. In the 1830s and 1840s, as Richard Stites notes in Serfdom, Society, and the Arts in Imperial Russia: The Pleasure and the Power, Vielgorsky's salon \\"played host to the most celebrated musical visitors to mid-century Russia: Liszt, Berlioz, the Schumanns, and Pauline Viardot among others ... Because of the attendance of Gogol, Zhukovsky, Vyazemsky, Lermontov, Odoevsky, Glinka, Dargomyzhsky, and Bryullov, a contemporary dubbed Vielgorsky's home \\"a lively and original multifaceted academy of the arts.' Berlioz called it 'a little ministry of fine arts.'\\" Vielgorsky presided over his salon with remarkable informality: in Stites' words, he \\"moved easily among all his guests. Returning from a formal court function, the count would doff his dazzling uniform embellished with sash and stars, don a simple coat, mingle with everyone, and charm them all. Though very close to the royal presence, he was known to comport himself equally to people of all classes.\\" Vielgorsky was the son of Polish szlachcic Jerzy Wielhorski and the brother of Maciej Wielhorski (Matvey Vielgorsky, 1794-1866), an amateur cellist who founded the Society of Lovers of Music with Prince Nikolai Borisovich Galitzin (also a friend of Beethoven) in 1828. Friendship with Maria Sergeyevna Durnovo Mikhail Vielgorsky knew Maria Sergeyevna Durnovo (Griboyedova), skilled piano performer and sister of famous Russian writer Alexander Griboyedov. According to the memoirs of Maria Durnovo: \\"Very often, the writer came to the sister's room. In the spring of 1823, whereas famed comedy remained a secret to public and majority of friends, Mikhail Vielgorsky, stumbled on several sheets of poem, written by the hand of Alexander Griboyedov, while assembling pages of sheet music on the piano of Maria Sergeyevna. Maria wanted to hide the accidentally discovered pages, but it was too late. The news of the new comedy rapidly spread around Moscow from the mouth of the well-known at the time musician\\".

The spiced minced meat is wound around bamboo, sugar cane or lemongrass sticks, it is then grilled on charcoal. Unlike skewers of other satay recipes which is made narrow and sharp, the bamboo skewer of sate lilit is flat and wide. This wider surface allowed the minced meat to stick and settle. The term lilit in Balinese and Indonesian means \\"to wrap around\\", which corresponds to its making method to wrapping around instead of skewering the meat. Variants As a Hindu majority island, the Balinese authentic version prefer pork and fish over other meat, and beef is originally seldom consumed in Bali. However to cater larger consumer that do not consume pork, such as Indonesian Muslim majority, in Balinese restaurant outside of Bali sate lilit often used chicken or beef instead. In Balinese fishing towns, such as the village of Kusamba, which faces the Nusa Penida Strait, sate lilit made from minced fish is favoured. Two of the favorite satay in Bali are sate lilit, and sate ikan (fish satay). Although there are fish sate lilit made with minced fish, sate ikan is using chunk of fish meat instead. The authentic Balinese sate lilit and sate ikan are rich in bumbu, a mixture of spices and herbs.

It is unclear what the Angles and Warini have to do with the Thuringians, but it might be a reference to all Germans living east of the Saale and Elbe rivers. is a law code that survives today in one 10th-century manuscript, the Codex Corbeiensis, alongside a copy of the Lex Saxonum, the law of the Saxons. The code was compiled in the first decade of the 9th century, probably 802‚Äì3, under Frankish patronage. The language of the law code is Latin and few Thuringians could have read it, nonetheless some must have cooperated with Frankish officials during the process of collecting and codifying the customs. The Lex Thuringorum, the Lex Saxonum, the Lex Francorum Chamavorum and the Lex Frisionum comprise the four so-called \\"Carolingian tribal laws\\" (karolingischen Stammesrechte), because they were produced at the same time at the direction of King Charles I in order to accommodate the differing legal customs of the nations living within his empire. They were neither totally faithful nor comprehensive reproductions of tribal law, but were created as part of a process of official christianisation. The historian Timothy Reuter writes that \\"the manuscript transmission does not suggest that [the Thuringian law] was extensively used, though there are enough different strata of law still visible in the text to suggest that it was not merely a literary exercise.\\" Per chapter 31 of the Lex Thuringorum, feuds were heritable: \\"To whomever an inheritance of land should descend, he also should receive the battlegear‚Äîthat is to say, the breastplate‚Äîand the [obligations] of vengeance for kin and the payment of wergild.\\"Ad quemncumque hereditas terrae pervenerit, ad illum vestis bellica, id est lorica, et ultio proximi et solutio leudis debet pertinere. Karl M√ºllenhoff cited this passage to show that heritable feuds were of German origin, but more recent scholarship has rejected the view that the early medieval Germanic law codes represent pure Germanic law; rather they fuse Germanic and Roman customs. In the Thuringian law, the severity of punishment for the crime of raptus (abduction) is equivalent to that for murder, an indication that the former was understood to include rape or sexual violence. Per chapter 47, a woman was permitted to have money, but not to spend it as she saw fit, nor was she to marry without permission. Notes Editions *\\"Lex Thuringorum\\", ed.

It was deemed significant as one of few surviving WPA school buildings in northeast New Mexico. The school was a four- room building built at cost of $6,000 which provided construction jobs, and which achieved consolidation of three former rural schools in the Dry Cimarron Valley. It was rural itself and at one point served 50 to 60 students in grades 1-10. It served until the 1960s when busing students to a larger school in Clayton became feasible. It was named for Felix Emmett Goodson, the county commissioner who achieved construction of the school, who was also a rancher; he managed Roberts Ranch, located just to the northeast of the school site; his wife Stella Goodson was a teacher at one of the schools consolidated.

WWE currently operates two Performance Center locations, which serve as training facilities for WWE wrestlers, as well as sports science and medical facilities. The first branch, located in Orlando, Florida, was opened on July 11, 2013. The second branch, located in Enfield, London, opened on January 11, 2019. History Today The Performance Center is home to WWE‚Äôs third brand, NXT. The facility covers and includes seven training rings (including a special padded ring for high-flying moves), a strength and conditioning program, edit and production facilities including an ultra-slow camera, and a voice-over room that performers and on-air announcers can use to practice. The facility was opened in 2013 and replaced the training center at WWE's former developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), which was based in Tampa and had been serving as WWE's developmental headquarters since 2008. The Performance Center trains around 65 to 70 wrestlers at any one time. Trainees have a variety of experience levels, from beginners from non-wrestling backgrounds to experienced wrestlers from the independent circuit. Wrestlers train to improve their in-ring performance, strength and conditioning, as well as working on their characters and personality. Upcoming referees, ring announcers, commentators, and backstage interviewers also train at the Performance Center. The trainees train full-time, while also performing at weekly NXT house shows and appearing on NXT television. In addition, established WWE Superstars often use the facility for training and injury rehab while mentoring new trainees. The Performance Center uses former wrestlers as trainers. The inaugural head trainer was Bill DeMott, who departed the company in 2015 and was replaced by Matt Bloom. Other trainers include Sara Amato, Robbie Brookside, Norman Smiley, Adam Pearce, Mike Quackenbush,https://torontosun.com/sports/wrestling/through-adversity-came- bliss-for-wrestlemania-35-host and Sarah Stock. Dusty Rhodes was responsible for developing the trainees' microphone skills and wrestling personas until his death in 2015. The Performance Center includes some guest trainers, including Kevin Nash and Scott Hall. In addition to training contracted performers, the Performance Center is also regularly used for tryouts which operate on an invite-only basis and include athletes from a wide variety of backgrounds, including established domestic and international professional wrestlers, amateur wrestlers, NFL and NCAA American football players, and individuals from a range of other sporting and non-sporting backgrounds. A second Britain-based Performance Center opened in Enfield, London on January 11, 2019. In April 2019, WWE announced plans to open additional Performance Centers in India and China. On March 12, 2020, WWE announced that live episodes of Raw and SmackDown would air from the Performance Center without an audience until further notice beginning with the following day's episode of SmackDown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the suspension of many professional sports leagues; the company had begun filming episodes of NXT without an audience the previous day. The last TV broadcast from the Performance Center was the August 17th episode of Raw. On March 16, it was announced that WrestleMania 36, set to take place on April 5 and previously scheduled for Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, would instead be moved to the Performance Center, again without an audience. The Performance Center would subsequently also host Money in the Bank, Backlash, and The Horror Show at Extreme Rules, before Raw, SmackDown, and pay-per-views moved to the new, larger-scale \\"ThunderDome\\" staging (under similar restrictions, but with a virtual audience on LED screens) at Amway Center beginning with the August 21 SmackDown and that weekend's SummerSlam. On October 4, 2020, WWE announced that they would move their NXT brand to the Performance Center full time, with the remodeled main arena being billed as the \\"Capitol Wrestling Center\\" as a tribute to WWE's roots, namely the Capitol Wrestling Corporation - the precursor promotion to WWE. Like WWE's \\"Thunderdome\\" set at the Amway Center used for Raw and SmackDown (also in Orlando), the \\"Capitol Wrestling Center\\" features fans appearing virtually on numerous LED boards, and will also have limited live fans. NXT to debut Capitol Wrestling Center - SI.com (Sports Illustrated) The first NXT event held at the \\"Capitol Wrestling Center\\" was NXT TakeOver 31. Locations =United States= The first WWE Performance Center facility was opened on July 11, 2013. The Performance Center replaced the training center at WWE's former developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), which was based in Tampa and had been serving as WWE's developmental headquarters since 2008. =United Kingdom= The British branch is located at the Great Cambridge Industrial Estate in Enfield, London and was opened on January 11, 2019. The center is 17,000 square feet and includes 2 rings. The school will be used to train potential future professional wrestlers from across the globe. 2015 shooting incident On August 31, 2015, Orange County Sheriff's Office deputies shot 29-year-old Armando Montalvo outside the Performance Center after he threatened them and charged at them. Montalvo was \\"obsessed\\" with female wrestler AJ Lee and made numerous attempts to trespass through the facility, despite an injunction against him by WWE. Days after the shooting, Montalvo claimed he was bipolar when he was questioned by detectives. He faced trial in February 2016 on charges of aggravated assault, resisting an officer with violence, and trespassing. A public defender representing Montalvo has entered a written plea of not guilty on his behalf. On April 19, 2018, WWE filed an emergency restraining order against Montalvo after he returned to the Performance Center the previous month and harassed the employees. In addition, Montalvo posted a threatening message to WWE wrestlers and staff on his Instagram account. On May 7, 2018, Montalvo was arrested for missing his court date with WWE.

The Chemistry of Powder & Explosives (1943) pages 296-297 Large quantities were manufactured for World War I and significant amounts remained unused after the war. Nitrocellulose deteriorates in storage, but military quantities of old smokeless propellant were sometimes reworked into new lots of propellants.Fairfield, A. P., CDR USN Naval Ordnance Lord Baltimore Press (1921) p.39 Through the 1920s Dr. Fred Olsen worked at Picatinny Arsenal experimenting with ways to salvage tons of cannon powder manufactured for World War I. Dr. Olsen was employed by Western Cartridge Company in 1929 and developed a process for manufacturing ball propellant by 1933.Matunas, E. A. Winchester-Western Ball Powder Loading Data Olin Corporation (1978) p.3 Reworked powder was dissolved in ethyl acetate containing small quantities of desired stabilizers and other additives. The resultant syrup, combined with water and surfactants, is heated and agitated in a pressurized container until the syrup forms an emulsion of small spherical globules of the desired size. Ethyl acetate distills off as pressure is slowly reduced to leave small spheres of nitrocellulose and additives. The spheres can be subsequently modified by adding nitroglycerin to increase energy, flattening between rollers to a uniform minimum dimension, coating with deterrents to retard ignition, and/or glazing with graphite to improve flow characteristics during blending.Davis, Tenny L. The Chemistry of Powder & Explosives (1943) pages 328‚Äì330Wolfe, Dave Propellant Profiles Volume 1 Wolfe Publishing Company (1982) pages 136‚Äì139 This manufacturing process also worked with newly manufactured nitrocellulose. Manufacturing time was reduced from approximately two weeks for extruded propellants to 40 hours for ball propellants. Rate of burning is controlled by deterrent coatings eliminating precision forming and cutting machines required for surface area control of extruded propellants. Safety was improved by performing most of the manufacturing process in water. Olin subsidiaries began manufacturing ball powder specification WC846 for .303 British ammunition during World War II. Hodgdon Powder Company salvaged 80 tons of WC846 propellant from disassembled .303 British military rifle cartridges in 1949 and sold the propellant to handloading civilians as BL type C. The C was to indicate the propellant burned \\"cooler\\" than traditional Improved Military Rifle propellants. Olin continued manufacturing WC846 for both civilian ammunition and 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridgesHarvey, Clay Propellant Profiles (1982) Wolfe Publishing Company pp.90,145,146&157 after the war.Simpson, Layne Propellant Profiles (1982) Wolfe Publishing Company pp.81 & 82 Manufacturing operations moved in 1969 from East Alton, Illinois, to the St. Marks Powder plant in Crawfordville, Florida. Constituents Olin's safety data sheet indicates the following composition of ball propellant: * 40 to 70 percent nitrocellulose * 10 to 60 percent nitroglycerin * 3 to 7 percent ethyl centralite * 1 to 5 percent dibutyl phthalate * 1 to 5 percent polyester adipate * 1 to 5 percent rosin * 1 percent diphenylamine * 1 percent ethyl acetate * 1 percent potassium nitrate * 1 percent potassium sulfate * less than 1 percent graphite * less than 1 percent N-Nitrosodiphenylamine Comparison with extruded (stick) propellants Aside from the manufacturing advantages, ball propellants metered more uniformly through powder measures used to load cartridges, had a longer storage life in loaded cartridges, and reduced erosion of rifle barrels when those cartridges were fired. On the other hand, ball propellant loadings were more difficult to ignite, produced brighter muzzle flash, and left heavier fouling in rifle barrels than had been common with extruded propellants. Some ball propellants burned satisfactorily over a narrower pressure range than extruded propellants. Some handloaders accustomed to extruded propellants had difficulty determining appropriate charges for the unique components they were assembling. Light loads might fail to ignite and burn properly while heavier loads might cause abrupt pressure increases to dangerous levels. Fouling difficulties increased as military loadings shifted from the .303 British and 7.62 NATO to the 5.56√ó45mm NATO. Some propellant lots clogged the gas tube of M16 rifles until concentrations of calcium carbonate stabilizers were reduced in 1970 as reformulated WC844 for the 5.56mm NATO cartridge. Civilian handloaders experienced similar fouling problems with smaller bore diameters. Some attributed the problem to residues of unburned deterrent coatings and suggested using magnum primers to improve ignition and burning at lower pressures. Ignition was ultimately improved by blending in a small percentage of uncoated propellant granules to improve the performance of standard primers. Expanded handloading options Hodgdon's original 80 tons of surplus BL-C introduced ball propellants to handloaders. Handloaders were ready to pay for newly manufactured ball propellants when the surplus supply was exhausted about 1960. =Hodgdon= * BL-C (Lot 2) for full-charge loads in the .308 Winchester and .223 Remington was newly manufactured by Olin in 1961 with 10 percent nitroglycerin, 10 percent diphenylamine stabilizer, and 5.75 percent dibutyl phthalate deterrent, but without the flash suppressant used in the surplus military propellant. * H110 was surplus .30 carbine powder introduced in 1962Labisky, Wallace Propellant Profiles (1982) Wolfe Publishing Company pp.83-97 for loading the .30 carbine and magnum revolver cartridges. * H335 was surplus Olin WC844 for full-charge loads in the .223 Remington and .308 Winchester. * H380 was Olin WC852 for full-charge loads in the .30-06 Springfield. * H414 was introduced in 1967 for full-charge loads in the .270 Winchester and .30-06 Springfield * H450 was for large capacity and magnum rifle cartridges. * H870 was surplus M61 Vulcan propellant introduced in 1959Hagel, Bob Propellant Profiles (1982) Wolfe Publishing Company p.109 for loading very large capacity magnum cartridges with bore diameter of or less. * HS5 was introduced in 1963 with 13.5 percent nitroglycerin for shotgun field loads. * HS6 was introduced in 1963 with 18 percent nitroglycerin for heavy shotgun loads. * HS7 was introduced in 1973 with 18 percent nitroglycerine for magnum shotgun loads. * Trap 100 was introduced in 1973 with 13.5 percent nitroglycerin for shotgun target loads. * HP38 was introduced in 1975 (similar to Olin 230) for target loads in handguns. =Olin= * 230P Pistol propellant with 40 percent nitroglycerin introduced in 1960 and replaced by 230 in 1973 for handgun target loads. * 231 reformulated 230 with 22.5 percent nitroglycerine and no deterrent coating so grain size and shape could be changed to minimize bridging in loading machines.Matunas, Ed Propellant Profiles (1982) Wolfe Publishing Company p.143 * 295P Pistol propellant introduced and discontinued in early 1960s. * 296 reformulated 295P introduced in 1973 with 10 percent nitroglycerin for magnum revolver loads. * 450SL Shotgun Loading propellant introduced in 1960 and discontinued in 1972. * 452AA replaced 450SL and AA12S in 1973. * 473AA replaced 500HS and AA20S in 1973. * 500HS High-velocity Shotgun propellant introduced in 1960 and discontinued in 1972. * 540MS Magnum Shotgun propellant introduced in 1960 and replaced by 540 in 1973. * 571 magnum shotgun propellant introduced in 1973. * 630P Pistol propellant introduced in 1968 and replaced in 1973 by 630 with 35 percent nitroglycerin and no deterrent coating for magnum revolver loads. * 680BR Ball Rifle propellant introduced in 1968 and replaced by 680 in 1973 for .22 Hornet, .218 Bee and .256 Winchester Magnum. * 748BR Ball Rifle propellant introduced in 1968 and replaced by 748 in 1973. * 760BR Ball Rifle propellant (similar to H414) introduced in 1968 and replaced by 760 in 1973. * 780BR Ball Rifle propellant introduced in 1968 and discontinued in 1972. * 785 (similar to H450) introduced in 1973 for the .243 Winchester. * AA12S introduced in 1968 for standard 12 gauge shotgun loads and discontinued in 1972. * AA20S introduced in 1968 for standard 20 gauge shotgun loads and discontinued in 1972.

The coalition is made up of approximately 40 Islamist parties and groups. History The coalition has called upon the opposition to break ties with figures they call \\"corrupt\\" from the Mubarak regime. Notably, the political wing of the group (the Building and Development Party) and the Wasat Party did not take part in protests held by pro-Morsi forces during the week of 18 October 2013. The alliance offered a new reconciliation initiative that does not include the reinstatement of Morsi on 26 October 2013; al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Homeland Party are not calling for the reinstatement of Morsi, while the Virtue Party, Authenticity Party and the Muslim Brotherhood are still demanding that Morsi be reinstated as president. The group has reached out to what it called \\"fellow revolutionaries\\" to cooperate with them against the protest law in Egypt in order to jointly organize protests; Kefaya objected to the call for cooperation. Members of the Building and Development Party, the political arm of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, wanted to meet with Yasser Al Borhamy, the deputy head of the Salafist Call as well as Emad Abdel Ghaffour, who is the head of the Homeland Party. Al Borhamy reportedly could not meet with the members, while Ghaffour asked them to stop demonstrations before talks could begin and rebuffed their demands for the reinstatement of Morsi and the bringing back of the Shura Council that was dissolved. Borhami denied being asked to serve as a mediator, though he stated that he would act as a mediator if there were no preconditions. The alliance has said it will boycott the 2014 constitutional referendum. Various groups and parties within the alliance including al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the Building and Development Party, the Islamic Party, the Freedom and Justice Party and the Virtue Party have criticized the Nour Party for its support of the draft constitution. The Islamic Party has not participated in meetings with the group because of what Mohamed Abu Samra (the secretary-general of the party) called the \\"brotherhood's radical thought\\". The Salafist Front issued a statement on 30 April 2014 that called on the alliance to temporarily stop its actions in order to avoid more violence; the alliance did not suspend its activities in response. Egyptian Prime minister Ibrahim Mahlab issued a decree on 16 October 2014 banning the alliance. Another decree was issued on 30 October 2014 which dissolved the alliance. A court postponed the appeal of the dissolution of the alliance until 13 November 2014. Affiliated groups Parties and organizations in the coalition include: Withdrawals The Wasat Party withdrew from the alliance on 28 August 2014. The Homeland Party withdrew from the alliance on 17 September 2014, though the reason for its leaving was to reorganize itself. The Authenticity Party was considering leaving the alliance because it has not achieved its goals. The Salafist Front had withdrawn from the alliance on 30 November 2014. The Independence Party announced on 4 December 2014 that it had withdrawn. The Arab Unification Party and the Islamic Party have withdrawn from the Anti-Coup Alliance. al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya is considering withdrawing from the alliance. Osama Hafez, the leader of the groups shura council, has called on the organization to withdraw from the alliance. Court cases A court verdict that could have banned the alliance was not given on 21 May 2014 because the Cairo Court for Urgent Matters ruled that it lacked jurisdiction. An appeal to dissolve the coalition was thrown out on 22 September 2014 partly because it did not indicate what parties are part of the alliance and did not indicate the coalitions alleged connections to \\"terrorist activities\\". Another verdict in September 2014 banned the alliance.

Gibraltar Parliament  Biography  Marlene Hassan Nahon is daughter of the late Chief Minister Sir Joshua Abraham Hassan and his second wife, Marcelle Bensimon, both Jews of Moroccan and Portuguese origin. Her sister, Fleur Hassan-Nahoum is a Barrister and current Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem. She has a BA in History of Art and Architecture from the University of Manchester. She also holds a PostGraduate Diploma in Journalism from the London School of Journalism. Political career After the death of minister Charles Bruzon, she launched herself as a candidate for the Gibraltar Social Democrats (GSD) in the by-election of 4 July 2013. In a press conference, she stated that she didn't have an agenda (besides the desire to contribute positively to Gibraltar), and said that she was \\"disappointed\\" with the policies of the ruling party (the GSLP) and willing to change the composition of the Parliament, where there is an \\"overwhelming number of lawyers\\" representing both groups of parties. Hassan Nahon received 39.95% of the total votes cast, but was not elected. =Member of the Parliament of Gibraltar= For the Thirteenth elections to the Parliament of Gibraltar, Hassan Nahon ran for a seat, resulting in her being elected on 26 November 2015 for the period starting on 9 December 2015 and ending in 2019.

The Gibraltar Women's Association, represented by the committee member Zohra El Gharbaoui, questioned the lack of attention to this matter by Gibraltarian government, adding that this was beyond a gender issue, a \\"complete lack of respect for a fellow MP\\". On 23 September Licudi issued a public apology to MP Hassan-Nahon.LICUDI APOLOGISES In 2017 she launched her movement, Together Gibraltar a grassroots civil society platform. On November 2018, the movement democratically voted to transition into a political party. On 24 September 2019 the party signed on for the Gibraltar General Elections. Together Gibraltar received an unprecedented result at the General Elections with party leader Marlene Hassan achieving the most votes in the Opposition Benches. Together Gibraltar received 21% of the overall votes, only coming 3% behind the current official Opposition. Hassan Nahon was a vocal critic of the Gibraltar government's handling of the British withdrawal from the European Union. As a result she was subject of attacks, many anti-Semitic in nature.

History Wanaparthy Samsthanam traces its history back to the 14th century after the Kakatiya kingdom declined. The successive Turkic Muslim dynasties, who invaded and settled in Deccan, found it ideal for Samsthanam to prevail. It was surrounded by three other Samsthanams. The vassal family Raja Rameshwar Rao II, who was a vassal of the Nizam of Hyderabad, died on 22 November 1922. As his successor, Krishna Dev, was a minor, his estate was managed as a Ward of the Court. Krishna Dev himself died before attaining majority and the crown passed on to his son Rameshwar Rao III, later to become simply J. Rameshwar Rao. With the surname 'Janampalli', Ram Dev Rao was the youngest son of the Raja of Wanaparthy. He had an older sister, Janamma, and elder brother Krishna Dev. The family roots have spread to the whole of Mahbubnagar district around Jadcherla and nearby talukas.

They scored a total of 689 goals and allowed a total of 566 goals and amassed 96 total standings points out of a possible 156 points. (The EISL awarded 3 standings points for a win, 2 for a shootout win, 1 for a shootout loss, and 0 for a loss in regulation.) The Bombers made the playoffs both years of their existence and played for the league championship in 1997. Connected to the Bombers by proximity, common ownership, and Interstate 10, the Lafayette SwampCats were the chief rivals of the Baton Rouge Bombers throughout the league's short history. More than half of Baton Rouge's regular season losses were to Lafayette and both of the Bombers' playoff losses were to the SwampCats. History =1997 season= The team's artificial turf did not arrive until one week before the team's inaugural home opener because the manufacturer, Tech Turf of Georgia, accidentally destroyed the turf they originally manufactured for the Bombers. The regular season ran from June through August 1997 with the playoffs taking place in early September. The Bombers finished second overall in the seven- team league. They finished the season with a record of 16 wins and 8 losses (including 1 shootout loss) for a total of 49 standings points. (The EISL awarded 3 points for a win, 2 for a shootout win, 1 for a shootout loss, and 0 for a loss in regulation.) The team reached the playoffs where they beat the Tallahassee Scorpions 23‚Äì16 in the semi-finals. The Bombers lost to the Lafayette SwampCats 12‚Äì9 in the inaugural EISL championship game.

The 1998 regular season ran from late May through mid August 1998 with the playoffs taking place in late August. The team averaged 3,004 fans per game over their 14 home games in the 1998 regular season, third-best in the league. On the field, the Bombers finished fourth overall in the seven-team league. They finished the season with a record of 16 wins (including 1 shootout win) and 12 losses for a total of 47 standings points. The Bombers made the playoffs, losing to the Lafayette SwampCats 2 games to 0 in the semi-final round. Rich Ryerson was named EISL Defensive Player of the Year for the 1998 season. Baton Rouge Bombers players named to the 1998 EISL All-League Second Team included defender Rich Ryerson and midfielder Olivier Grava. Players named to the EISL All-League Third Team included goalkeeper Dave Tenney.

The drum sound is deeper, more resonant, with more midrange. We‚Äôre talking small but important increments, but this is moving toward traditional rock values.\\" They went on to write that on a structural level, \\"It sounds upside-down and backward. Most Portal songs are loosely connected chains of arrangements; the unity is not on the song level but on the largest level, the band‚Äôs constant use of certain modes and rhythmic patterns. You don‚Äôt remember how the songs go, but you do remember their weird feeling, their atmosphere. Every beat is articulated, and because of the upward guitar strokes and the fast, ungainly drumbeat combinations, the rhythm sounds like rising rather than landing ‚Äî as if the beats were being pulled upward out of the drums.\\" Pitchfork noted in their review the unsettling, dissonant character of the album, writing that \\"the expected shapes have been mutated and multiplied into orders so strange they seem surreal. Rhythms stay the course where you expect them to shift before finally switching without warning. Sharp-barbed riffs emerge from and climb above dins that once seemed irreparably unordered. Songs that, for the first minute, appeared to have but one aim and direction find a half-dozen new missions and vectors in a five-minute span.\\" They also noted the wide-ranging influences beyond those typical for a death metal album, including doom metal, black metal, and noise rock. Spin wrote that \\"Where black metal conjures symphonic whirlwinds of minor-key mayhem and death metal froths with jagged pessimism, Portal have found a middle ground where all forms of extreme negativity work in concert.\\"  Critical reception  Vexovoid was met with positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic (a review aggregator site which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 from music critics), based on 7 critics, the album has received a score of 76/100, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The album has been noted for providing clearer production values than heard on previous albums, which renders the band's \\"intricacies...more apparent\\" without detracting from the band's mysterious qualities, which were described as a \\"temple to the inscrutable\\". Writing for Decibel Magazine, Rod Smith concurred, noting that, with Vexovoid, \\"Portal retire the idiosyncratic production style that had people mentioning vacuum cleaners and wind tunnels...The added clarity imparts a new sense of urgency\\" to the band's approach. Pitchfork praised the album's depth and complexity despite its short runtime, describing it as \\"meticulous\\" and \\"merciless\\". Tiny Mix Tapes emphasised the album's Lovecraftian and horror-related themes, describing the album as \\"a temple to the inscrutable, and the geometries and inscriptions featured in its blueprints seem inked in a language only accessible to those whose sanity the Old Ones have already shattered.\\" They went on to write that \\"It‚Äôs Portal‚Äôs ability to invoke the strange aeons beyond death that makes their music so uncannily horrific. Their death metal refuses to stop at death and continues even deeper into the darkness.\\" Track listing Personnel Personnel adapted from AllMusic credits. = Portal = * The Curator ‚Äì vocals * Horror Illogium ‚Äì lead guitar * Aphotic Mote ‚Äì rhythm guitar * Ignis Fatuus ‚Äì drums * Fugue ‚Äì bass guitar = Additional personnel = * Kriss Hades ‚Äì artwork * Nihilistic WarFucker - additional graphics * Industrie Chim√®re Noire - additional graphics, design References Category:Portal (Australian band) albums Category:Profound Lore Records albums Category:2013 albums ","title":"Vexovoid"},{"id":"39815157","text":"Albert White Hat (November 18, 1938June 13, 2013) was a teacher of the Lakota language, and an activist for Siƒçh√°≈ã«ßu Lak»ü√≥ta traditional culture. He translated the Lakota language for Hollywood movies, including the 1990 movie Dances with Wolves, and created a modern Lakota orthography and textbook.  Early life  Albert White Hat was born near St. Francis, South Dakota, on the Rosebud Reservation to a traditional family. \\"His grandfather was Chief Hollow Horn Bear.\\" He spoke only Lakota as a child. He attended day school in Spring Creek, South Dakota. Unlike many of his peers at St. Francis Jesuit Mission School, who were sent to boarding school at age five, he was not sent until age sixteen. > I grew up with a lot of the older people, listened to the stories. And those > stories were inside of me. And I went into a boarding school system, and > they killed those stories in that system. I came out of there totally > ashamed of who I am, what I am. In the late sixties, I went back to the > culture, on my own. I let my hair grow, I started speaking my language. And > one of those times, I fasted. I did the vision quest, for five years. Teacher of Lakota language and culture After graduating from St. Francis Jesuit Mission School, he held various jobs. White Hat pushed for instruction in the Lakota language in the Todd County, South Dakota school district when his children entered school in the 1960s. Lakota language was not a part of the South Dakota state curriculum at the time. Eventually he learned to create his own lesson plans, and became a Lakota language teacher himself. He became chair of the \\"Committee for the Preservation of the Lakota Language\\" in 1982. White Hat spent twenty-five years teaching the Lakota language at Sinte Gleska University on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, and became the head of the Sinte Gleska Lakota Studies Department.\\" He developed a teaching method that uses extensive examples from the culture of the Brule Lakota, and became known as a scholar of the language. He would teach Lakota culture to \\"both tribal members and non-Native Americans.\\" He has been quoted as saying, \\"When we teach a language to a student, we should develop in that student another heart and another mind.\\" He assembled his notes into a book in 1999, Reading and Writing the Lakota Language. He was the \\"first native Lakota speaker to publish a Lakota textbook and glossary.\\" He was active in traditional Lakota spiritual life. Rosebud Sioux Tribal President Cyril Scott called him \\"a great teacher\\" and \\"spiritual leader.\\" White Hat spoke at conferences and gatherings, including the 2008 \\"Planning for Seven Generations\\" conference in Boulder, Colorado, and was well known on the powwow circuit. A \\"Lakota Documentaries\\" video by Don Moccasin (1948‚Äì2009) features Albert White Hat speaking about the survival of the Lakota language, in Lakota with English language subtitles.

They have tube-shaped nostrils (hence the name) which assist them with their feeding. Discovery and etymology The Beelzebub bat is one of 126 new species found in the Greater Mekong region described in 2011. The holotype was collected in November 2007 in Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve, which is located in Vietnam. There were two other tube- nosed bats found in Southeast Asia in 2011: Ashy-gray tube-nosed bat (Murina cineracea) and Walston's tube-nosed bat (Murina walstoni). All three species are small for bats and M. beelzebub is medium-sized for a Murina bat. These three new tube-nosed bats were discovered by a team from the Hungarian Natural History Museum (HNHM) and Fauna and Flora International (FFI). Vespertilionid bats have many cryptic species. Eight new species of vesper bats were found in Southeast Asia between 2005-2009. The use of DNA technology has proved very useful in differentiating between the various species of Murina. Based on its morphology, it was placed into the suilla species group of the genus Murina. Members of the suilla group include: *Little tube-nosed bat (Murina aurata) *Bala tube-nosed bat (Murina balaensis) *Ashy-gray tube-nosed bat (Murina cineracea) *Eleryi's tube-nosed bat (Murina eleryi) *Slender tube-nosed bat (Murina gracilis) *Murina harpioloides *Greater tube-nosed bat (Murina leucogaster) *Murina recondita *Forest tube-nosed bat (Murina silvatica) *Brown tube-nosed bat (Murina suilla) *Scully's tube-nosed bat (Murina tubinaris) *Ussuri tube-nosed bat (Murina ussuriensis) *Walston's tube-nosed bat (Murina walstoni) It was named \\"Beelzebub\\" and \\"demon\\" because of its coloration and fierce behavior, alluding the use of the term \\"Beelzebub\\" as reference to the underworld in Christian texts. Description This bat is small enough to fit in a person's hand, weighing . Its nostrils are tube- shaped. Its color pattern is unique for the regional habitat: a white underbelly, black head, and dark back. It lacks the golden guard hairs so common in other members of the genus Murina. Its behavior tends to \\"flight\\" before \\"fight\\" and it is also quite shy, avoiding human contact. However, if captured they can be very fierce. Its forearm is approximately long. Its tail is long, and its hind foot is long. Its ears are long, and its tragus is long. Its dental formula is , for a total of 34 teeth. Biology and ecology As of 2013, there are still few details known about them and their ecology. Like other members of its genus, it is insectivorous. Range and habitat It lives in tropical forests of the Greater Mekong Subregion. It has been documented in Kon Ka Kinh National Park and Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve, both of which are in Vietnam. It is suspected there are many more species of bats yet to be discovered in the region. It has been captured at elevations of and above sea level. Conservation They are threatened by habitat loss via deforestation. As it is a relatively new species, it has not yet been evaluated by the IUCN.

Recruited through the Australian Red Cross Society, the group's nickname referred to the colours of their specially-designed uniforms. After arriving in France the nurses were split between different hospitals where they treated wounded and ill soldiers. They returned to Australia individually following the war and did not receive any medals or veterans' benefits from the Australian government. Selection Following the outbreak of World War I the Australian Red Cross Society contacted the French Government offering to provide a team of nurses. The French Government accepted this offer.Hetherington (2009), p. 58 The Red Cross Society subsequently placed an advertisement in the Australian press seeking medically qualified nurses who were able to speak French. A total of 90 applications were received. Of the applicants, the Red Cross Society eventually selected 11 Sisters, nine nurses and a masseuse, among whom was Dorothy Ellena Duffy, Sister Hilda Loxton and Sister Lynette Crozier. Most of these women were aged in their late 20s or early 30s. A French teacher was also engaged to accompany the team on their voyage to Europe. The nurses signed contracts agreeing to serve for twelve months or the duration of the war, whichever was shorter. While the nurses did not form part of the military, the Department of Defence funded their passage to Europe. The Australian Jockey Club initially volunteered to pay the first six months of the Bluebirds' salaries at the same rate as those of military nurses, but may have subsequently funded the nurses' salaries for the duration of the war. The department store chain David Jones donated the nurses' distinctive uniforms, which were made from dark blue material.

Deployment The Bluebirds left Sydney on board the hospital ship No. 2 Hospital Ship Kanowna on 4 July 1916, which sailed to the United Kingdom.Hetherington (2009), pp. 58‚Äì59 After arriving in France the nurses were split up and worked in different hospitals. Most served in permanently established hospitals well away from the war zone where they mainly cared for French soldiers. However, several of the nurses were assigned to a mobile hospital that operated near the front lines; this hospital was bombed by a German aircraft on one occasion, and was also near the edge of a region affected by a poison gas attack on another occasion. One of the Bluebirds was appointed the matron of a hospital, and two others were placed in charge of floors of their hospitals. None of the nurses were injured as a result of military action during the war, but several suffered from periods of prolonged illness.Hetherington (2009), pp. 59‚Äì60 Return The nurses returned to Australia individually after the war. In contrast with their departure from Australia, their return voyages were not organised by the Australian Government and several of the women paid for their passage by working as nurses on board ships sailing from Europe to Australia. The Australian Government also did not provide the Bluebirds with medals or veterans benefits as they were civilian rather than military nurses. However, several received the M√©daille de la Reconnaissance fran√ßaise from the French Government in recognition of their service.Hetherington (2009), p. 60 References ;Citations ;Works consulted * Further reading ¬∞ ¬∞Rogers, Irene (2017). \\"Breaking bread with the dead: the Australian \\"Bluebird\\" nurses of World War One seen through the lens of microhistory\\", PhD Dissertation, CQU.

It was aired on May 13, 2013. The episode was written by David Weddle & Bradley Thompson and it was directed by Omar Madha. Plot On a bus to New York, Nolan (Grant Bowler) escorts Rynn (Tiio Horn) to prison, while Amanda carries money raised by the town to pay for a mag-rail spur to Defiance. Also on the bus are an Earth Republic representative named Olfin (Jane McLean), her two husbands, Kasper (Milton Barnes) and Ziggy (Steve Lund), and a preacher named Preston (Andrew Musselman). During the trip, the bus is ambushed and the driver is killed by a bomb planted by Preston. Preston, joined by two hijackers, demand s the money Amanda is carrying. The ambush goes wrong; one of the hijackers and one of Olfin's husbands are killed. Preston is injured and takes Olfin as a hostage. During the ambush, Rynn escapes and disappears. Nolan and Amanda concoct a plan to rescue Olfin; killing Preston and the remaining hijacker, they discover that Olfin was a secret partner in the hijacking scheme all along. Her plan was to steal the money Defiance had gathered to force the town to take Earth Republic's funding for the spur. As Olfin tries to get the money, Rynn returns and captures her. Nolan arrests Olfin and takes her back to Defiance; Rynn leaves with Olfin's second husband. In Defiance, Olfin boards the next bus to New York in handcuffs; however, her supposed police escort immediately releases her as they depart. Olfin orders the police escort to find out everything they can about Amanda. In the meantime, in Defiance, Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) kidnaps a Castithan (Ben Cotton) because she believes he is the one who tortured her as a child. She tortures him in the same way, demanding he confess and explain his actions. Tommy (Dewshane Williams) sees Irisa's strange behavior, follows her and finds the captive Castithan. Tommy convinces Irisa to stop, which triggers the Castithan to confess and explain why he did what he did; he believed Irisa was a \\"destroyer/saver goddess\\", and to fulfill her purpose, she had to kill him after the tortures. Via flashbacks it is revealed that Nolan rescued Irisa as a child just before she was supposed to kill the Castithan. Irisa refuses to follow her supposed destiny, and releases him.

Kraft (born April 10, 1941) is a retired Democratic political consultant, best known as the campaign manager for the unsuccessful reelection bid of U.S. President Jimmy Carter. In September 1980, only weeks before the general election, he stepped down amid an uncorroborated charge, later resolved, that he had previously used cocaine. Background The son of a pediatrician, Kraft was born into a staunchly Democratic family in Noblesville, Indiana. He was raised in the then-Republican stronghold of Muncie, Indiana. In 1963, he graduated with a degree in government from Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire; from 1963 to 1965, he served in the Peace Corps in Guatemala. He worked part-time on the staff of U.S. Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, a Carter primary opponent in 1976. In 1966 and 1967, Kraft engaged in graduate work in Latin American studies at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.. Thereafter, he was something of a political wanderer during the era of the Vietnam War. Political campaigns Kraft first worked in a political campaign in 1970 on behalf of Jesse Unruh, the former Democratic Speaker of the California State Assembly, who failed to prevent the reelection of Ronald W. Reagan as governor of California, but later served as the California state treasurer. Kraft subsequently settled in New Mexico, where in the capital city of Santa Fe he became the executive director of the state Democratic Party. Though a paid position, he had to engage in the necessary fundraising to guarantee that he was indeed compensated. In 1974, Kraft worked to elect the liberal Jerry Apodaca as governor. Apodaca was running in a close contest against the conservative Republican Joe Skeen, later a long-term member of the United States House of Representatives. As the party executive director, Kraft met Carter, still the governor of Georgia, who came to New Mexico on Apodaca's behalf. In 1975, he connected once again with Carter in the early stages of 1976 presidential campaign, of which he was the national field director and then the national field coordinator. He was regional coordinator for the 1975 Democratic national telethon. Kraft also worked to solicit campaign contributions from ten western states so that Carter could qualify for federal matching funds under the amended 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act. He was sent to organize the Iowa caucuses; though Carter finished second to \\"None of the Above\\", he was proclaimed by the national media as the winner in Iowa and went forward to key primary victories thereafter in New Hampshire, Florida, and Pennsylvania, where Kraft also played a leading role in assembling the Carter partisans to eliminate the challenge of U.S. Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington state. Kraft offered Bill Clinton, then the unopposed Democratic nominee for Arkansas attorney general, two years before his first election as governor of his native state, the management of the Texas campaign for Carter and running-mate Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota, but Clinton instead worked within Arkansas for Carter, who easily won Arkansas. Hillary Clinton became a deputy field director for Carter-Mondale. After Carter unseated the non-elected incumbent, Gerald R. Ford, Jr., then of Michigan, he named Kraft as his appointments secretary, a post Kraft filled from 1977 to 1978. Then Kraft became an assistant to the president for personnel and political coordination. In 1980, he left the government position to manage Carter's national campaign against Ronald Reagan, who four years earlier had lost the Republican nomination to Gerald Ford. Some six weeks prior to the general election, Carter invoked the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 and retained Gerald J. Gallinghouse, a New Orleans Republican former U.S. Attorney for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, as the special prosecutor to investigate whether Kraft, who was known for his flamboyant life-style, had formerly used cocaine. The case against Kraft centered on his short-term predecessor as the 1980 campaign manager, Evan Dobelle, who claimed to have witnessed Kraft using the narcotic in 1978 in New Orleans. In 1981, Gallinghouse closed the case on the grounds that the \\"evidence did not warrant an indictment\\". Still Kraft was saddled with nearly $60,000 in unreimbursed legal expenses; later the Reagan administration obtained passage of a law that reimburses persons in such situations when cleared of wrongdoing, but the measure was not retroactive to cover Kraft. Similarly, another special prosecutor had earlier cleared the Carter chief of staff, Hamilton Jordan, of the same offense. Kraft and Jordan were close friends who had worked together from the beginning of the Carter national campaign. In 1980, Kraft, Jordan, and Patrick Caddell, the Carter pollster, had shared a house in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C. As the national campaign manager, Kraft was like Carter considered skilled in the details of politics; he organized the group known as the \\"Hispanic American Democrats\\" to increase the turnout of Hispanics, already Democratic in orientation but then known for less voter participation than the other minority groups. Working with Kraft was Robert Schwarz Strauss, a friend of U.S. Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas; Bentsen had also been a Carter primary rival in 1976. Strauss was in 1980 the chairman of the Democratic National Committee with responsibility for fund-raising and making the needed contacts with national party leaders and media representatives. In the 1980s, through his company Avanti Ltd., Kraft became heavily involved as a consultant in political campaigns in Latin America, an area in which he had developed rapport while he was in the Peace Corps. In 2003, he appeared in the failed campaign of former Governor Howard Dean of Vermont, who was attempting to win the Democratic nomination in 2004 to deny Republican President George W. Bush a second term in the White House. Retirement In 2004, Kraft lived in Corrales, New Mexico, also the home of former U.S. Senator Fred R. Harris of Oklahoma, another of the 1976 Democratic primary presidential candidates. As of 2008, Kraft is retired and lives with his wife, Molly, in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

It is a mini-blade chassis with built-in storage system. The VRTX comes in two models: a 19\\" rack version that is 5 rack units high or as a stand-alone tower system. Specifications The VRTX system is partially based on the Dell M1000e blade-enclosure and shares some technologies and components. There are also some differences with that system. The M1000e can support an EqualLogic storage area network that connects the servers to the storage via iSCSI, while the VRTX uses a shared PowerEdge RAID Controller (6Gbit PERC8). A second difference is the option to add certain PCIe cards (Gen2 support) and assign them to any of the four servers. Servers: The VRTX chassis has 4 half-height slots available for Ivy-Bridge based PowerEdge blade servers. At launch the PE-M520 (Xeon E5-2400v2) and the PE-M620 (Xeon E5-2600v2) were the only two supported server blades, however the M520 was since discontinued. The same blades are used in the M1000e but for use in the VRTX they need to run specific configuration, using two PCIe 2.0 mezzanine cards per server. A conversion kit is available from Dell to allow moving a blade from a M1000e to VRTX chassis. Storage: The VRTX chassis includes shared storage slots that connect to a single or dual PERC 8 controller(s) via switched 6Gbit SAS. This controller which is managed through the CMC allows RAID groups to be configured and then allows for those RAID groups to be subdivided into individual virtual disks that can be presented out to either single or multiple blades. The shared storage slots are either 12 x 3.5\\" HDD slots or 24 x 2.5\\" HDD slots depending on the VRTX chassis purchased. Dell offers 12Gbit SAS disks for the VRTX, but these will operate at the slower 6Gbit rate for compatibility with the older PERC8 and SAS switches. Networking: The VRTX chassis has a built in IOM for supporting ethernet traffic to the server blades. At present the options for this IOM are an 8 port 1Gb pass-through module, a 24 Port 1Gb switch (R2401) and a 20 X 10Gb (+2*1Gb) switch (R2210)R2401 & R2210 quick start guide, downloaded 3 July, 2017. The 8 port pass through module offers 2 pass-through connections to each internal blade slot where the 24 port 1Gb switch option provides 16 internal ports (4 per blade slot) and 8 external ports to be used to uplink to the network. The R2210 has 16 internal, 4 external and two additional 1Gb external ports. The I/O modules used on the VRTX are a different size to the I/O modules of the M1000e, so I/O modules are not compatible between the systems. Management: A CMC is responsible for the management of the entire system. The CMC is similar to the CMC used in the M1000e chassis. Connection to the CMCs is done via separate RJ45 ethernet connectors. Power and cooling: The system comes with four PSUs at 110 or 230 V AC. There is no option to use -48 V DC PSUs. Each 1100 watt PSU has a built-in fan. For cooling of the server-modules there are four blower-modules, each containing two fans, and for cooling of the rest of the chassis there are 6 internal fans which can only be reached by opening the chassis. The fans used are the same units as used in the PowerEdge R-720xd rack-server. KVM: Unlike the M1000e the VRTX doesn't have a separate KVM module, but it is built into the main chassis. The system only supports USB keyboard and mouse. Control of the KVM function is done via the mini LCD screen. These USB ports as well as the 15 pin VGA connector are at the front of the system. USB: The USB connectors are only for connecting keyboard and mouse; it doesn't support external storage via USB. LCD: Via the mini-LCD screen at the front of the system you can find status information of the system, configure some basic settings (such as CMC IP address) and manage the built-in KVM switch. The LCD screen functions can be controlled via a 5 button navigation system, similar to the system used on the M1000e. Serial: A single RS-232 serial communication port is provided at the back of the system. This connector is only used for local configuration to the CMC: it doesn't allow you to use this connector as serial port of a server in the system. Expansion slots: The system provides space for five PCIe Gen2 (2.0) expansion cards and 3 'full height' PCIe Gen2 (2.0) expansion cards. Via the management controller you can assign each slot to a specific server. You can only assign a PCIe slot to a server when the server is powered off as the PCIe card is recognized and initialized by the server BIOS at startup. Only certain PCIe cards are supported by Dell. Currently, VRTX support is limited to eight different PCIe cards, including six Ethernet NICs (Intel and Broadcom), a 6Git SAS adapter (LSI) and the AMD FirePro‚Ñ¢ W7000. Usage The VRTX is targeted at two different user-groups: either local offices of large enterprises where the majority of the IT services are centrally provided via remote datacenters - where the VRTX system provides local functions such as a relative small virtualisation platform to provide locally needed services as VDI workstations, local Exchange or Lync server and local storage facilities. The entire system will normally be managed by the central IT department via the CMC (for the chassis) and some IT manager as SCCM or KACE for the servers running on the system.Chris Cowley's BLOG: Dell announces VRTX, 4 June 2013. Visited: 30 June 2013 The other intended public is the SME market with limited IT requirements. The tower model is designed to run in a normal office environment. Dell claims that the noise level of the VRTX system is very low and can be installed in a normal office environment: there is no need to install the system in a special server-room. It is possible however to convert a tower-VRTX into a rack-mounted VRTX. Operating systems The server blades in a VRTX system (M520/M620/M820) have a different list of supported operating systems than their M1000e counterparts. The operating systems supported to run on the blades are: Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, VMware ESX 5.1, and VMware ESX 5.5. Support for running other operating systems is only supported as virtual machines on Hyper-V or ESXi. The main intended and marketed use will be as a system running Hyper-V or ESXiDell reference architectures with 3 typical setup's of VRTX: Exchange 2013 on Hyper-v, Hyper-V 2012 server and VRTX as VMware ESXi cluster, visited: 4 August 2013 The supported Hypervisors on the VRTX Chassis are Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware ESXi 5.1, and VMware ESXi 5.5. At this time other hypervisors, like Citrix Xenserver, are not supported. At launch no Linux based operating systems were supported, mainly because there was no Linux driver available for the MegaRAID controller for shared storage access.ServerWatch.com: Dell debuts VRTX for converged infrastructure, section 'Windows Only'. 5 June 2013. Visited: 30 June 2013 As of June 2014, Linux support for the VRTX Shared PERC 8 was released.

Depending from which island the women came, they may also be called Trinidadian women or Tobagonian women respectively.Trinidad and Tobago, everyculture.com Women in Trinidad and Tobago excel in various industries and occupations, including micro-enterprise owners, \\"lawyers, judges, politicians, civil servants, journalists, and calypsonians.\\" Women still dominate the fields of \\"domestic service, sales, and some light manufacturing.\\" By participating in Trinidad and Tobago's version of the Carnival, Trinidadian and Tobagonian women demonstrate their \\"assertive sexuality.\\" Some of them have also been active in so-called Afro-Christian sects and in running the \\"sou-sou informal rotating credit associations.\\" Gender roles in Trinidad and Tobago are influenced primarily by legacies of patriarchy and colonialism. Baptiste asserts that historical views of race and colonialism impact Trinidadian culture in such a way that are often excluded from Western feminist studies. \\"Caribbean gender theory has to wrangle with the boundedness of patriarchy at the same time as it tussles with the barnacles of colonialism and imperialism.\\" Gender performances in Trinidad and Tobago occupy three distinct spaces: physical, social, and cultural. Baptiste argues that the physical, public spaces represent a \\"postcolonial essentialist collage\\" in which performances are gendered by the socialization of gender roles according to very essentialist views of men and women. Many public spaces display African imagery, primarily from Nigeria and Ghana because these nations are still Trinidad and Tobago's closest political allies and cultural beacons. These social spaces provide an outlet in the face of a country struggling with increasing crime rates against women. Education On average, from primary to tertiary levels of schooling, girls outperform or have higher enrollment levels than boys in Trinidad and Tobago. This pattern has been observed for the past couple decades or so. Primary education: In primary schools, girls show a lower drop-out rate and repeater rate, and score higher than boys on the SEA examination. In 2015, girls constituted of approximately two thirds of the top students in the Second Entrance Assessment (SEA) examination and CAPE. Secondary education: In secondary schools, despite the fact that most secondary schools are structured based on a stratified system of prestige, girls consistently outperform boys in within-school and national testing. In particular, girls are more likely to take the examination and across the Caribbean, girls achieve higher CXC results in English, history and social studies. Tertiary education: There is a high enrollment rate of females in tertiary learning institutions‚Äìabout 65 per cent of total students enrolled at University of the West Indies, St. Augustine campus in 2009/2010 were female. Economy Women generally enjoyed the same legal rights as men, including employment, education, and inheritance rights. No laws or regulations require equal pay for equal work. While equal pay for men and women in public service was the rule rather than the exception, both the government and NGOs noted considerable disparities in pay between men and women in the private sector, particularly in agriculture. =Workforce participation= As of 2016, 60% of Trinidadian women participate in the labour to force, compared to 81% participation from the male population. Historically, female labour force participation rates in Trinidad and Tobago are lower than male participation rates. Over the past two decades (1990-2010), this disparity between these rates has been decreasing. Following the recession of the 1980s when the labour force participation rate dipped to 55.6 percent, the rate has hovered around 62 percent over the last decade. The size of the labour force has increased over the years, moving from 480,000 persons in 1987 to 619,000 persons in 2010‚Äìan annual average growth rate of 1.1 percent. Even though males continue to be predominant, the share of females in the labour force has steadily increased moving from 31.8 percent in 1980 to 41.4 percent in 2010. Generally, women are dominant in the service industry and as clerks and associate professionals. There is some level of equality at the professional level, however men have a greater presence at senior levels. Women whose highest level of education attained was primary were 13% more likely to participate, while those with secondary level attainment were 14% more likely to participate. Women with tertiary level education had a probability of participation of 8%. Trinidad and Tobago's female labour is also lower than some of its (commonly compared to) neighbouring countries. From 2000 to 2009, Barbados and Jamaica's rates averaged 65.1 per cent and 57.4 per cent, respectively. According to the 2012 National Gender Policy, despite high levels of education and employment, women are still the primary care-givers in the society with the majority of the responsibility for raising children, performing housework, taking care of the sick, the aging and elderly, and the disabled, and managing many of community- based organizations. =Gender wage gap= In 2016, Trinidad and Tobago ranked 91st in the world (out of 114 countries) in wage equality between men and women for similar work. Research shows that there are substantial wage differences between men and women in Trinidad and Tobago. While women account for the largest entry into both the workforce and education, a 2015 study shows that their wages are still less than men. On average, women earn US$22,656 a year, while for that same period, men earn US$41,527. In the private sector, it appears that female workers, regardless of their position along the wage distribution, face a similar degree of discrimination. At the aggregate level, there is a significant difference between male and female wages. Investigation showed that the demographics with the highest levels of discrimination were in the age groups 35-44, income levels $3,000-$5,999 and private sector employment vs public sector. As of 2015, the wage gap is found to be larger in the private sector than the public sector, and the gap is larger at the lower end of the wage distribution. In the private sector, at the 10th percentile the gender wage gap is 25.9 percent compared to 12.0 percent at the 90th percentile. Trinidad and Tobago has ratified several conventions related to labour and workforce standards including the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions including the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention, 1976 (No. 144), the Industrial Relations Act (1972), the Retrenchment and Severance Payments Act (1985), the Minimum Wage Act (1976), and most recently, the Equal Opportunity Act (2000). In particular, the Equal Opportunity Act (EOA) prohibits an employer or prospective employer from discriminating against an employee or a prospective employee because of their status (race, disability, ethnicity, marital status, religion, sex, or geographical origin). However, currently, Trinidad and Tobago does not have any legislation pertaining to equal pay for work of equal value. According to the National Council of State Administration Secretaries Research Corporation, there are six key factors that influence this wage gap: occupation, human capital, work experience, career interruption, motherhood and industry sector.CONSAD Research Corporation. (2009). An analysis of the reasons for the disparity in wages between men and women. US Department of Labor. Pittsburgh, PA. Retrieved from http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender_Wage_Gap_Final_Report.pdf Even with these in mind, Mahabir & Ramrattan assert that discrimination based on sex is apparent when critically examining similar scenarios affecting both men and women. The greatest disparity comes from the fact that married women or those in common law marriages still earn disproportiante wages compared to men in the same scenario. While Trinidad and Tobago is ranked 50 out of 148 countries by the Gender Inequality Index,Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. (2012). Closing the gender gap: Act now. Paris, France: OECD Publishing. Retrieved from: https://www.oecd.org/gender/Executive%20Summary.pdf the major factors that influence workplace disparities are inherently gendered. This is generally thought to be due to a combination of a strong patriarchal \\"old boys\\" network which favors each other regarding employment and wages, and a historical and cultural background that does not place as much value on women's work as it does men's. =Property rights= The Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago prohibits all forms of discrimination on the grounds of gender. ¬Ä The Trinidad and Tobago Succession Act was passed by Parliament in 1981 and Legislation on Property Rights was also passed, revising provisions on real property and women's property rights. As such, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago affirms women's rights to property ownership. Although there exists no legal restrictions to women's access to land tenure, Trinidad and Tobago still has a gender disparity of distribution of land ownership, with some studies indicating that only 14% of private land owners are female. Cited in Johan- Boodram 2011 It is suggested that this is predominantly male dominated due to the customary regimes like patriarchal inheritance practices. =Prostitution and sex workers' rights= Under the Sexual Offences Act, prostitution is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and those found guilty of an offence are liable of up to 5 years imprisonment. This includes person that \\"lives wholly or in part on the earnings of prostitution\\" and those who are \\"aiding, abetting or compelling the prostitution\\". Authorities continue to monitor, investigate, and prosecute major operators believed to be engaged in soliciting for prostitution. Family =Cohabitation/Common-law relationships= Cohabitation is legal, and common-law relationships can be found to be legally protected under the Cohabitational Relationship Act of 2000. The Act empowers the court to make orders for maintenance for a common- law spouse as well orders in respect of their rights to property provided that the common-law relationship has lasted for at least five years; or there is a child or children of the relationship; or the party has made substantial contributions to the common-law relationship. Under the Cohabitational Relationship Act of 2000, after the death of a common-law spouse who has left no valid will, the surviving common-law spouse or cohabitant is entitled to benefit from the estate of deceased once they lived with that person in a common-law relationship for at least five years immediately before the deceased died. The surviving common-law spouse is entitled to benefit from the estate of the deceased in the following ways: * where there are no children and no surviving legally married spouse, the common-law spouse is entitled to the whole estate, or; * where the deceased has a child or children and no surviving legally-married spouse, the surviving common-law spouse is entitled to half of the estate, or; * where the deceased has a surviving legally- married spouse, the surviving common-law spouse is only entitled to a portion of the deceased's estate acquired during the common-law relationship =Marriage= As of June 2017, the legal age of marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is 18. Prior to 2017, four Acts regulated the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tobago, leading to a number of inconsistencies: * The Marriage Act of 1923, which governs Christian and civil marriages, set the minimum age of marriage at 18 years but allowed exceptions on religious grounds. * The Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act set the minimum age of marriage at 12 for girls and 16 for boys. * The Hindu Marriage Act set the minimum age of marriage at 14 for girls and 18 for boys, * The Orisha Marriage Act set the minimum age of marriage at 16 for girls and 18 for boys. In May 2016, child marriage was the subject of heated debate after the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO) suggested that the country's marriage laws should not be amended, despite allowing girls as young as 12 to get married. In January 2017, the Attorney General Faris Al-Rawi announced a bill to harmonize the country's marriage laws and raise the legal minimum age of marriage to 18 years old, without exception. On 18 January 2017 this bill passed through the Senate and moved to be debated by members of parliament in the Lower House. According to the then Attorney General Faris Al-Rawi, in the past 20 years, the country had recorded 3,478 child marriages, and of this figure, a mere 74 were males under the age of 18, meaning that 97% of child marriages were girls. In June 2017, The Miscellaneous Provisions (Marriage) Bill 2016 was passed, setting the legal age of marriage to 18. In addition, the bill provides for a new offence where there is conviction on indictment for solemnising the marriage of persons under the age of 18 years, so marriage officers will be penalised if he/she conducts a marriage on a minor. =Divorce= Divorce is able to be granted to couples after at least one year of marriage, though there are exceptional circumstances under which the court would entertain a petition within a year of the marriage. Either spouse may file a petition for divorce. Either spouse must either be a permanent resident of Trinidad and Tobago, or must have been a resident for at least one year immediately before the divorce petition is filed. There is currently only one \\"ground\\" for divorce‚Äîthat is the marriage has broken down irretrievably. Generally, to satisfy the court that the marriage is beyond repair, at least one of five circumstances must be proven to exist in the relationship: adultery, irreconcilable behaviour, desertion of a continuous period of at least two years immediately before the petition is filed; separation of a continuous period of at least two years immediately before the petition is filed and your spouse agrees to get a divorce; and separation of a continuous period of at least two years immediately before the petition is filed. Spousal agreement is not necessary in this final instance. =Parental rights/Family law= Research from the University of the West Indies Cave Hill Campus indicated that in contested custody cases, fathers were granted custody roughly 50% of the time. It was found that the maintenance of the status quo was an important consideration as whoever had the children, kept them, even when the mother left because of violence. Gender stereotyping was evident; the mother's moral conduct falling short of an acceptable standard‚Äîwhich was usually higher than for fathers‚Äîseemed to influence the courts. In awarding fathers custody, courts invariably found a mother figure‚Äîa sister, mother, wife or girlfriend of the paternal figure‚Äîto assist with childcare. =Parental leave= Currently, the only parental leave supported by the government is maternity leave, as stipulated under The Maternity Protection Act, 1998 of Trinidad and Tobago. To qualify for parental leave, an employee must be employed full-time for at least 12 months. An employee is entitled to thirteen weeks maternity leave and may proceed on such leave six weeks prior to the probable date of confinement, i.e. the expected due date. During the period of maternity leave, an employee is entitled to receive pay from their employer to an amount equivalent to one month's leave with full pay and two months' leave with half pay. In May 2012, while the Maternity Protection Amendment Bill was in the Senate, there was a strong call for paternity leave from Senators on all sides of the political divide, citing the importance of father-child bonds made during early child development, single-father provisions. The bill also raised considerations for parental leave for people who adopt children, as well as issues regarding sexism in the workplace, with allegations of women being demoted or fired once they returned from maternity leave. The bill sought to increase maternity leave from 13 weeks to 14 weeks. Politics Trinidad and Tobago is a parliamentary democracy governed by a prime minister and a bicameral legislature. Anyone over the age of 18 is eligible to vote. Roughly 31% of parliament are female and 10% of ministerials position are held by women. In 2010, Kamla Persad-Bissessar became the first woman in history to become the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and Attorney General of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. She was born in April 1952 and later went on to attend University of the West Indies, Norwood Technical College (England,) and the Hugh Wooding Law School. She was awarded a B.A. (Hons.), a Diploma in Education, a B.A. of Laws (Hons.) and a Legal Education Certificate. In 2006 she obtained an Executive Masters in Business Administration (EMBA) from the Arthur Lok Jack Graduate School of Business, Trinidad. Persad-Bissessar went on to teach; after six years of lecturing she moved on to become a full-time Attorney-at-Law and later in 1987 she entered political scene. Her positions in the political scene are many and range from the years 1987-2016. The positions that she has served include alderman for St. Patrick County Council, Member of Parliament for Siparia, serving as Attorney General, Minister of Legal Affairs and Minister of Education. In 2006 she was appointed Leader of the Opposition becoming the first woman to hold that position from Trinidad and Tobago and as of August 2017, continues to serve in this capacity. She served as the Prime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago from 2010 to 2015. Reproductive rights =Contraception= Contraception is legal in Trinidad and Tobago, and varying contraception methods for both men and women are widely available throughout the country either through the government-run clinics under the Ministry of Health, organisations such as the Family Planning Association of Trinidad and Tobago and private medical practitioners. =Abortion= Under the Offences Against the Person Act, abortion in Trinidad and Tobago is illegal except in case of threat to the life or health of the pregnant woman. The punishment for a woman who has an abortion is four years in prison and the punishment for a doctor or other person who performs the procedure is the same. Aiding in the process of finding someone to perform an abortion or other preliminary steps is also illegal and subject to a two-year prison sentence. Although statistics on abortion in Trinidad and Tobago are not accurate, the practice is believed to be widespread. As for most of its Caribbean neighbours, unsafe abortion is the country's leading cause of maternal mortality, and a major cause of maternal hospital admissions. However, activism to introduce public policy and legislation that effectively address this aspect of women's reproductive rights and health is generally met with public outcry. The Roman Catholic Church has traditionally led the anti-choice movement, reacting forcefully and quickly to all calls for abortion law reform. The church wields considerable clout in Trinidad and Tobago. It is the largest denomination with nominal members making up 29% of the population.7Central Statistical Office, Trinidad and Tobago. Population and Vital Statistics Report. 1999 [Google Scholar] They are today bolstered by a number of other church-based anti-abortion groups, some from other Christian religions. While leaders of the Hindu and Muslim faiths have expressed opposition to abortion, several have noted grounds on which exceptions may be made, including threat to the mother's life, incest and rape. A 2007 national survey found that although almost half of respondents had an unfavourable perception of abortion, more than half of them were in favour of broadening the legal grounds for accessing terminations. Incest, rape and danger to a woman's life were cited as the most significant circumstances under which abortions should be permitted. The vast majority of respondents agreed that voting on abortion law reform by members of the legislature should not be based on personal beliefs. Notably, 74% of Catholic respondents were in favour of liberalising the abortion law. Also significant is that the proportion of respondents expressing an anti-choice point of view rose with age. Violence against women =Age of consent= As of May 2017, under the Children's Act, the age of consent for sexual intercourse in Trinidad and Tobago is 18. Prior to May 2017, a child was defined as persons under the age of 16 years and the Sexual Offences Act listed various offences for engaging in activities with persons under 16. Anyone who sexually touches a child under 16 can be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of $50,000 and to imprisonment for ten years; or (b) on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for 20 years. As a result, Trinidad And Tobago had a close-in-age exemption. \\"A close in age exemption, commonly known as 'Romeo and Juliet law' in the United States, is a law designed to prevent the prosecution of underage couples who engage in consensual sex when both participants are significantly close in age to each other, and one or both are below the age of consent. Depending on the situation, the Trinidad And Tobago close-in-age exemption may have completely exempted qualifying close-in-age couples from the age of consent law, or merely provided a legal defence that could have been used in the event of prosecution\\". The change in the age of consent from 16 to 18 created a need for the government to re-examine and change the laws related to the various Marriage Acts of the country. =Rape= Rape, including spousal rape, is illegal and punishable by up to life imprisonment, but the courts often hand down considerably shorter sentences. The government and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) report that many incidents of rape and other sexual crimes were unreported, partly due to perceived insensitivity on the part of the police. One group, the Rape Crisis Society, stated that there were 229 new cases of rape reported during the year, in addition to 615 continuing investigations. Over 60 percent of its clients were between 12 and 26 years of age. Many community leaders asserted that abuse of women, particularly in the form of domestic violence, continued to be a significant problem. The law provides for protection orders separating perpetrators of domestic violence, including abusive spouses, from their victims, as well as for penalties that include fines and imprisonment. While reliable national statistics were not available, women's groups estimated that from 20 to 25 percent of all women suffered abuse. Citing a 10 percent increase in the number of domestic violence cases filed in the magistrate's court during the previous year's law term, outgoing Chief Justice Sharma asserted that domestic abuse was a detriment to the country's peace and security. In January the Attorney General's Office provided a domestic violence manual to law enforcement officials. NGOs charged that police were often lax in enforcing the law. The Division of Gender Affairs (DGA) in the Ministry of Community Development, Culture, and Gender Affairs operated a 24-hour hotline for victims of rape, spousal abuse, and other violence against women, referring callers to eight shelters for battered women, a rape crisis center, counseling services, support groups, and other assistance. =Sexual harassment= Although related statutes could be used to prosecute perpetrators of sexual harassment, and some trade unions incorporated anti-harassment provisions in their contracts, no laws specifically prohibit sexual harassment. Furthermore, both the government and NGOs suspect that many incidents of sexual harassment go unreported. =Domestic violence & sexual assault= In Trinidad and Tobago, women and girls experience domestic violence, incest, rape and other forms of sexual violence and abuse to a degree that is staggering and almost common-place. Domestic violence-related homicide are second only to gang murders as the leading non-medical-related cause of death for women. In 2010, 940 reports of domestic violence were made to the Police, 68.2% of which were for \\"assault by beating\\". That same year, the Police received 215 reports of rape, 22 reports of incest, 158 reports of grievous sexual assaults, and 278 reports of sex with minor females 14‚Äì16 years of age (Crime and Problem Analysis Branch, TTPS). The degree of sexual assault and harassment suspected to be higher as many incidents of gender-based violence are not reported. #LifeInLeggings Near the end of November 2016, the hashtag \\"#LifeInLeggings\\" began circulating on Caribbean social media. Within the thread were countless tales of the sexual harassment and sexual and domestic violence that women in the Caribbean experience on a daily basis; from casual everyday street harassment, workplace sexual harassment, to explicit accounts of sexual abuse of girls, victim-shaming and protection of male abusers through a conspiracy of silence. The anecdotes reveal that even though many T&T;/Caribbean women may live independently, and may have a good education and a job, in the transactions of daily living they must still deal with pervasive sexism, gender prejudice entrenched deep within the culture, and active ill treatment from many men. Such men may routinely demean women, see women as inferior, and feel they have the right to control them, use them or abuse them. The heartfelt nature of the negative experiences shared with the hashtag triggered much heated public discussions in reaction to issues raised. Religion and spirituality =Cultural Spaces and Islam= As far as cultural spaces are produced, Trinidad and Tobago has a large interconnected Muslim population that showcases the duality of public/private spaces. Scholars point to the contrast in which Muslim women within the country perform gender in order to express self-empowerment. Many of these women do not identify as feminist due to the conflicting nature of Western feminism in relation to the historic patriarchal influence of Islam. Baptiste and other scholars point to expressions of piety from Muslim women to expose the monolithic narrative that all Muslim women‚Äîeven those living within the Western world‚Äîexperience oppression due to Islam. In fact, Baptiste argues that \\"an uncritical adoption of hegemonic feminist theory leads to the reproduction of somatic norms\\" within the culture. Public education within Muslim communities in Trinidadian culture does not require Islamic schools to adhere to any state curriculum; these cultural spaces operate in a unique, interconnected space. Here women can remain devout in their Islamic faith while simultaneously maintaining their social membership to a larger Trinidadian culture. Baptiste explores how Muslim women in Trinidad and Tobago \\"possess as much or as little spatial autonomy as any other woman in Trinidad. If there are constraints on the woman‚Äôs mobility, it is more gender than religiosity.\\" Music & Gender In an analysis of music and its influence in Trinidad and Tobago, Hope Munro Smith investigated the nuances of calypso music with respect to gender performance. She discovered that representation in calypso music was gendered by a large margin that favored male performers over females. Smith presents the historical context of public ordinances that forced the female influences on the culture underground. This resulted in public performances of calypso being co-opted by \\"middle-class businessmen who charged a set admission price.\\" Public performances by women were seen as uncivilized and Smith asserts social workers saw it as their duty to subdue the performances of these lower-class women. While male calypso performers were revered, the female performers were mocked and given names not unlike Jezebel that roused suspicion of the female's character. Calypso scholars point to the fact that the genre \\"became increasingly and almost exclusively a forum for the fiercely competing [male] egos\\". By the end of the twentieth century, female performers in Trinidad and Tobago had been socialized to be inferior and ultimately invisible. Smith believes they had all but disappeared entirely. This was a means of social control over women who saw the male performers of calypso as idea caricatures of men; \\"the ultimate sweet man\\" who has sex with anyone woman he wants because he is so desirable. Possession of women is seen as the ultimate reward both in bed and in society. Smith presents this \\"I'll do what the hell I like\\" as an attitude that is gendered to favour males and sexist against females. The performances are socialized in such a way that woman will fawn over male singers and present him with sexual favors and anything else that will keep him around. Smith's final assessment is that \\"music in Trinidadian context takes a very significant place alongside larger political projects and concerns.\\" The performances of male dominate the culture creating a narrative that man's rightful place is to dominate this and other arenas. Just like in calypso music, man's domination of women is a cultural experience that socially controls woman's position in bed, in family, and ultimately within Trinidadian society.

He was played by several child actors, being Daiki Sawada in the short movie 4444444444, Ry≈çta Koyama in the original two V-Cinema movies, Yuya Ozeki in the theatrical movies and The Grudge, Ohga Tanaka in The Grudge 2, Shimba Tsuchiya in The Grudge 3, Sh≈´sei Uto in Ju-on: White Ghost and Ju-on: Black Ghost, Kai Kobayashi in the 2014 Japanese reboot Ju-on: The Beginning of the End, and Garrett Masuda in the parody Scary Movie 4. He is characterized by his pitch-black eyes, pale skin, and the haunting meowing sounds he makes. Overview He can be considered a prominent character in the series, second to Kayako, his mother. His first appearance was in Takashi Shimizu's short movie 4444444444 and his haunting goes all through the franchise series in a house in Nerima, Japan. He is one of the enactors of the curse, which states that when someone dies amidst rage and intense wrath, those feelings remain at the death site and kill whoever it touches. His next appearance was in The Grudge 3, played by Shimba Tsuchiya. He also has a guest appearance in Ju-on: White Ghost and Ju-on: Black Ghost respectively, the 2009 Japanese sequels and both are played by Sh≈´sei Uto. Toshio has his first major appearance in the 2014 reboot Ju-on: The Beginning of the End and its sequel Ju-on: The Final Curse, where unlike the previous films, he is the main antagonist and the ultimate cause behind the curse. History and characteristics =Japanese timeline= Toshio was born to Takeo and Kayako Saeki, a Japanese couple residing in Nerima City, Tokyo on July 27, 1987.Ju-on: The Grudge. Dir. Takashi Shimizu. Prod. Taka Ichise. By Takashi Shimizu. Perf. Megumi Okina, Misaki Ito, Misa Uehara, Takashi Matsuyama, and Yui Ichikawa. Geneon Entertainment, 2003. Film. He was named after his mother's crush (Shunsuke, ‰øä‰ªã), afterward adding a character from his father's name (Takeo, ÂâõÈõÑ) to avoid suspicion. To commemorate Toshio's first day at elementary school, Kayako got him a black kitten that he named Mar. His father, despite being displeased with this, did not object to keeping the pet. His teacher happened to be his mother's old crush, and their meeting rekindled the woman's feelings. Takeo discovered her journal, in which she wrote of her love for Kobayashi. Furious, Takeo believed that Kayako was cheating on him and that Toshio was not his son. When Kayako came home that day, Takeo stabbed her to death. Takeo took Mar from Toshio and killed it with the same box cutter used previously to torture Kayako, then buried the cat in the dirt path beside their house. After Toshio was sent to his room, he escaped to the attic, where Takeo left him to die. There, Toshio found his mother's corpse and was shortly after spirited away by her ghost. This begins a curse upon that house, in which the ghosts of Kayako, Toshio and Takeo (who is killed by Kayako soon after her murder) attack people who enter, re-enacting the murders and following the victims wherever they go. In no portrayal of the ghosts do victims ever attempt to fight back. Toshio is often seen outside of the house without clothing and as chalk-white as his mother. He usually just haunts his victims ‚Äì instead of killing them, he spirits them away. 2014 reboot The 2014 reboot Ju-on: The Beginning of the End gives an entirely different backstory for Toshio and the Saeki family as a whole. In the film, before the Saeki family even moved in, there was another family who resided there: the Yamaga, whose eldest son, Toshio, was found dead in the second-floor closet during a heat wave. Thus, the house's curse is not entirely caused by the Saeki family, as a group of four schoolgirls who visited the house were killed solely by Toshio. Toshio is also the ultimate cause of the Saeki murders, as he became Kayako's child by \\"entering\\" her womb, while she was frustrated by her inability to conceive a child with Takeo. Takeo eventually found the truth years afterward and killed his wife, igniting the curse to include Kayako as well. In the sequel, Ju-on: The Final Curse, it is revealed that Toshio is capable of controlling anyone claimed by the curse under his control, not just Kayako, as shown when he directs Yayoi to kill her sister, as well as Reo and her mother. He is also able to possess a person and leaving them at will; doing this ensures the survival of his second mortal incarnation long enough to be adopted by Reo's family, thus dooming them. =American timeline= Similar to the original, Toshio's mother has a crush on his teacher ‚Äì in this case, Peter Kirk ‚Äì and this obsession leads to a misunderstanding with his father. After Takeo snaps Kayako's neck, he sees Toshio watching from the second floor. Takeo drowns Toshio, as well as his cat, in the bathtub. His maternal grandmother is Nakagawa Kawamata, his aunt is Kayako's younger sister, Naoko and his uncle is Daisuke. Differences between versions * In the American remake, Takeo kills Toshio by drowning him in the bathtub. He even kills the cat with a utility knife. He puts Toshio's body in the closet and seals it with duct tape. * In the Ju-on novel, Toshio hides in the attic from his father. Instead of coming after him, Takeo slams the cupboard door shut, leaving Toshio to starve to death. However, whilst in the attic, Toshio encounters the body (and the ghost) of his mother, so it is unknown if he did indeed starve, or if Kayako claimed him. Also in the novel, Toshio buries his own cat in the dirt, after both of their deaths. * In the Ju-on films, Toshio is six years old at the time of his death. In the Grudge films, he was either seven or eight years old (the online newspaper article that Karen reads states Toshio's age as seven, but a link to another online article on the search engine she uses states Toshio's age as eight). * In the Ju-on: The Beginning of the End reboot, there are two Toshio identified: Toshio Yamaga, who resided in the house nineteen years before the main timeline, and Toshio Saeki, who was reborn in Kayako's womb ten years before the main timeline. Toshio is also older than the previous continuities, being at least 9 years old at his death. While the backstory is completely changed as mentioned above, Toshio's pet cat, Mar, is still retained.

Maeda played an important role in Indonesian independence; he met Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta at his house in Jakarta on 16 August 1945 and his house was used for drafting the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence. After leaving military service, Maeda worked in the oil industry. Early life and career Maeda was born in the town of Kajiki, Kagoshima on 3 March 1898. His father was a school principal there, and he was part of a former samurai family. He joined a Marine College at the age of 18, specializing in navigation, and he was a first lieutenant by 1930 when he joined the Naval Staff. Military career =Pre-WW2= After joining the Naval Staff, he worked at the European Affairs section for one and a half years before moving to the Naval Station at ≈åminato, where he was stationed between 1932 and 1934. During this time period, his wife died, and Maeda did not remarry. In early 1937, Maeda became the adjutant to Rear Admiral Sonosuke Kobayashi during his visit to England to represent Japan in the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. They traveled aboard the cruiser Ashigara. Afterwards, he served as aide-de-camp to admirals Zengo Yoshida and Kiyoshi Hasegawa. Maeda became the Japanese naval attach√© to the Netherlands in 1940. In October that year, he went to Batavia in a diplomatic mission attempting to secure trade between the Dutch East Indies and Japan ‚Äì particularly in oil. In addition to trade negotiations, he was also tasked with espionage and establishing a fifth column, supported by civilians such as Shigetada Nishijima. Maeda returned to Japan in mid-1941, when he was made deputy of the European Affairs section under his elder brother Minoru Maeda. =Occupation and revolution= Maeda (front row, second from left) during Sukarno's visit to Makassar in 1945 Maeda was placed in charge of the Western New Guinea area during the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies. After the invasion, Maeda was dispatched again to Batavia/Jakarta in August 1942 as a liaison between the Japanese Sixteenth Army and the naval forces. In October 1944, following a declaration by Japanese Prime Minister Kuniaki Koiso promising Indonesian independence, Maeda sponsored a school known as Asrama Indonesia Merdeka. Maeda stated that the intent of the Asrama was to prepare a younger generation of Indonesian leaders. Following the 1945 surrender of Japan, nationalist leaders Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta, and Achmad Soebardjo went to Maeda's house on 15 August to confirm the surrender, which Maeda unofficially confirmed. Early the following morning, Sukarno and Hatta were kidnapped by nationalist youths (pemuda) and taken to Rengasdengklok, Karawang. Maeda and Soebardjo found out several hours later, and after guaranteeing the pemuda safety from the Kempeitai Maeda offered his house to be used as the site for negotiations. Fearing intervention from the still-present Japanese Army, Maeda pushed for a declaration of independence, wanting an orderly sovereignty transfer. Negotiations followed between Maeda, Sukarno and Hatta with army authorities ‚Äì who by the terms of surrender were required to maintain the status quo ‚Äì and the authorities agreed to allow a declaration of independence provided order was maintained and the Japanese were not involved. On 17 August before dawn, a group ‚Äì Maeda, Sukarno, Hatta, Soebardjo, Nishijima, Tomegor≈ç Yoshizumi and (an army representative) gathered in Maeda's house to compose the text of the declaration. After an agreement was reached on the text, the proclamation was read to the public later that day. Maeda also assisted with allowing the Naval Office press to be used to print copies of the proclamation text, which was distributed across Jakarta. Maeda was later arrested by allied authorities along with his staff and imprisoned for failing to maintain the status quo. He was later tried by a Japanese military court, found not guilty, and was released in 1947. He left military life. Later career In the 1950s, Maeda, Nishijima and Miyoshi published their memoirs which included their part in the declaration of independence ‚Äì though their contributions were denounced by Sukarno in a 17 August 1959 speech (specifically, Sukarno attacked accusations that the Indonesian National Revolution was Japanese-made). Just the previous year, Maeda had had a reunion with Sukarno during the latter's 1958 visit to Japan. Regardless, in 1962, following the West New Guinea dispute, Sukarno accepted Maeda's offer to resume oil exploration by Japanese companies in the Vogelkop Peninsula area. During Maeda's military time, he had been aware of the potential for oil production there. Prior to this, Maeda (and Nishijima) had also been involved with Indonesian crude oil exports through Permina (later merged to form Pertamina), and participated in a joint venture with a PKI-controlled company. Legacy Following the Indonesian independence, some political groups in Indonesia ‚Äì particularly those associated with Sutan Sjahrir ‚Äì attempted to discredit Maeda's contribution to Indonesia's independence, accusing the Asrama of being training centers for anti-communist infiltrators. On the other hand, Wikana's writings explicitly stated that Maeda was sincere in his support, and others noted that Maeda often intervened to save Indonesians who were being suspected by the Kempeitai. British historian Benedict Anderson proposed that Maeda and other Japanese collaborators had viewed the cooperation as beneficial to long-term relations between Indonesia and Japan. His former subordinate Nishijima regarded Maeda as \\"politically, a naive person\\" regarding his public involvement in the joint venture with the PKI. In 1973, Maeda was invited to Indonesia to receive the Bintang Jasa Nararya. After Maeda's death on 13 December 1977, Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik sent a telegram to Japan, acknowledging Maeda's aid in the declaration of independence and wrote that his name \\"will be written in the annals of Indonesia with golden letters\\". Maeda's former house is today the Formulation of Proclamation Text Museum.

He began singing as a boy soprano at St. Mary's (Anglican) Church, Kangaroo Point, Brisbane in 1894 He began acting with Pollard's Lilliputian Opera Company, led by Tom \\"Pollard\\" Sullivan, which toured Australasia and the East with considerable success until its disbandment in 1905 in Perth after a tour of South Africa (during which he married the company's danseuse). It was when he was engaged with this company that he came to the attention of J.C. Williamson, with whose Light Opera Company he remained the rest of his life; he appeared in operettas, particularly in Gilbert and Sullivan. His most memorable part came in 1924 when he played Franz Schubert in the Sydney premiere of Lilac Time and made it his own as far as Australia was concerned. Though only 51 years old and having a magnificent physique, Ralston suffered from poor health and was forced to stand down due to heart problems during tours of North Queensland and New Zealand. He traveled with the company to Perth and played, to great effect, The Grand Inquisitor in The Gondoliers, The Sergeant in Trial by Jury and Poo Bah in The Mikado and was scheduled for the company's production of Lilac Time, but was unable to take his place on stage.

It is the third and final installment of the Skinjacker trilogy.  Summary  The story continues with Mary Hightower being inside a glass coffin and Milos leading Mary‚Äôs Afterlights in a train heading west, while Allie the outcast was being strapped on the front of the train. While continuing on their journey until they stopped because there was a church on the way. Milos decided that he, Jill, Moose and Squirrel go reaping (an act of skinjacking someone to purposefully kill teens and children and make them citizens of Everlost). Right after they reaped, they met Jix, an afterlight whose specialty is skinjacking animals. Jix out of curiosity, went along with them to the train. After a while they moved the church out of their way and continued heading west. Nick (now just a figure made out of chocolate, who doesn‚Äôt remember a lot about his past.) and Mikey McGill recently got trapped by Clarence, a scar wraith (a person who can see and touch the living and Everlost worlds, that can extinguish Afterlights with the touch of his Everlost arm.). Nick escaped while Mikey was still trapped, telling Nick to run. Mikey told Clarence everything he knows about Everlost. Meanwhile, the train Allie was strapped in front of, was a target for an ambush full of Afterlights called the ‚ÄúNeon Nightmares‚Äù. Milos then ordered the conductor to ram into the mansion, thinking it was the same as the church; that it was placed in front of the train tracks and can be moved away by ramming into it. But they got derailed, Allie was rescued by Jix and gave her a coyote to furjack. The leader of the Neons, called Avalom ordered his comrades to push Jix down. But then Jill offered to trade her coin and Milo‚Äôs for his freedom. She then convinced them that there were more coins, and that she‚Äôll reveal the location of the coins only if they let her and Jix live. Avalom gave in to her offer, and brought them, the Interlights, and Mary Hightower back to their base in Alamo. Nick arrived at the derailed train confused. Milos, Moose and Squirrel managed to twist Nick‚Äôs memory into thinking that he was in love with Jill, and making him slowly forget about Allie. The skinjackers, Nick and the rest of the afterlights followed the direction the Neon‚Äôs were walking to bring back Mary. Allie head back to the train, or where it used to be then saw Nick‚Äôs chocolate footprints and followed it. She reached San Antonio and decided to look for Nick there. During her search, she found out that a guy named Seth Fellon was skinjacked to set a school on fire and helped him to break out of prison. While back at Alamo, in the Neon‚Äôs hideout area, Jix and Jill managed to send Avalom into the light, and lead the Neons, to the City of Souls, in Mexico. Nick, Allie, Mikey and Clarence interrupted Milos reaping. Clarence touched Squirrel, causing him to extinguish. All of the Interlights, including Mary woke up. Mary met Jill and Jix and told her everything that happened. They later reunite with Milos, Moose and the other Interlights. Then set a course to the City of Souls, while Mikey, Allie, Nick and Clarence went to Corpus Christi. At a bay, Mary and Milos betrayed Jix and let him sink in the ocean, Jill left Milos and Mary because Jix wasn‚Äôt with them. But Jix furjacked a few sea animals and made his way on land. He later found Jill and met Allie and the others. Jix and Jill decided to help them stop Mary‚Äôs plans. They split up in teams; Jill going back to Mary to learn the names of the skinjackers, Nick, Mikey and Jix to seek help from the King of the City of Souls, Clarence and Allie to subdue the skinjackers‚Äô bodies using the names Jill gave them. Allie found Milos' body and killed him, therefore relieving him of his skinjacking skills. When Mary found out Milos couldn't skinjack anymore and hence he was useless to her, she ceased to care about him, making him an ordinary Afterlight. Ever since Allie didn‚Äôt have any new information about the skinjackers‚Äô name, she decided to interfere with Mary herself. She and Clarence then drove to a huge deadspot, called the Trinity Vortex; where the first nuclear bomb exploded and where the actual bomb existed in Everlost. After a few moments of Allie‚Äôs plans not working, Mary ordered Milos to touch the scar wraith, knowing he'd oblige as he was still in love with her. After Milos extinguished, a storm appeared both in Everlost and the living world. Mikey, Nick, Jix along with the inhabitants from the City of Souls, and the statue made of coins arrived in the Hindenburg. By the end, Clarence managed to send nearly every Afterlight into the light, using the bomb and the coin statue. Jix and Jill found each other, and taught the new skinjackers the basics for a while. Mary sunk to the bottom of the earth, Mikey got into the light. Allie skinjacked her own body, and Nick became the ‚Äúnew Mary‚Äù, tending the Afterlights until they were ready to go into the light; without of course, Mary‚Äôs vision.  Setting  Everfound takes place in Everlost. Everlost is the place between life and death that all children or teenagers below the age of 18 end up after getting lost in their journey to the light at the end of the tunnel. Afterlights, are unseen by the \\"living\\" world. The Afterlights cannot interact with the real world unless they are skinjackers. These Afterlights can sink to the Earth's core if they stay still on living ground. Unless it is a \\"deadspot\\", a place where someone has died, where the Afterlights don't sink.  Characters  * Alexandra \\"Allie the Outcast\\" Johnson: A fourteen-year-old girl died in the same car crash as Nick. Allie is brave and \\"goal\\" orientated though not a planner. She was reborn nine months later in \\"Everlost\\" as an Afterlight. In the first book Everlost, Allie discovers that she has the gifted ability to \\"possess or skinjack\\" people. This book continues her quest to stop Mary‚Äôs plans and save the living and Everlost worlds. After she finished her plans, Allie skinjacks her own body. * Nicholas \\"Nick\\": A fourteen years old half-Japanese boy. He in the same car crash as Allie on the way to a wedding when he died with chocolate on his face; now he is stuck in formal clothes and a chocolate covered mouth for eternity. In Everfound, he joins forces with Allie, Clarence, Mikey, Jix and Jill to stop Mary‚Äôs plan of ending the living world. By the end of the book, he looks after the afterlights and makes sure they go into the light when the time comes. * Megan \\"Mary Hightower\\" McGill: The self-proclaimed expert on Everlost. She has written many books on living in the world between life and death. She also thinks of herself as the mother of the many children stuck in this world, being one of the oldest inhabitants at fifteen. She died in a green school dress which adds to her motherly appeal. She will do anything to keep the \\"lost\\" Afterlights in Everlost. Mary has a lunatic plan of destroying the world and bringing the children into Everlost to \\"save\\" them. But after seeing her plan fail, she then willingly let herself sink to the bottom of the earth rather than admitting she was wrong. * Mikey McGill: The brother of Megan McGill, he is fourteen years old, and is trying to redeem himself after spending nearly 30 years \\"kidnapping\\" afterlights after believing a prophecy in a Chinese fortune cookie that in exchange for 1000 souls, he can return to the land of the living. He tries his best to keep from returning to the old ways to please Allie. He accompanies Allie in her request to return to her home to meet her parents one last time. Mikey has the ability to change his form into anything he wishes. Mikey may come off as selfish and proud, but he secretly loves Allie with all his heart. After helping Allie defeat his sister‚Äôs plan he goes into the light, giving Allie the chance to go back to her own body. * Milos: A highly skilled Russian skinjacker the age of seventeen that serves Mary. He continues to tend Mery‚Äôs Afterlights while heading west. He eventually loses his ability to skinjack, and gets extinguished. * Jill: A skinjacker who worked for Mary. Also known as Jackin' Jill. She has messy and tangled blond hair with nettles in it. Jill is a tough Afterlight that does whatever she wants most of the time. She then met Jix and slowly falls in love with him. She then helps Allie foil Mary‚Äôs plans. * Moose: A skinjacker who is permanently in American football gear. His speech is impeded due to the mouthguard he is wearing. He travels with Milos. He loses his ability to skinjack, and falls in an endless loop of playing football all by himself. * Squirrel: A skinjacker who goes by his name by acting squirrely. He often repeats words more than once. He is the second traveler with Milos, along with Moose. He gets extinguished by Clarence, a scar wraith, which causes all the Interlights to wake up. * Jix: A skinjacker who possesses animals instead of people. He served the King in the City of Souls, until he went to the bottom of the earth. He meets Jill another skinjacker, and slowly falls in love with her. He decides to help Allie stop mary‚Äôs plan. He teachers the new skinjackers basic moves and rules along with Jill for a while. * Clarence: A scar wraith that helps Allie kill the bodies of the new skinjackers that Mary has. He then helps send nearly every afterlight to the light with the first atomic bomb, and the statue made of coins that can send any Afterlight to where they were going before they arrived in Everlost.

Fifteen firefighters were killed by the forest fire when a dry weather front caused the winds to suddenly increase and change direction. The fire quickly spread into dense forest, creating spot fires that trapped some of the firefighters in a firestorm. Nine firefighters died during the fire and six more died shortly thereafter from severe burns and respiratory complications. Another 38 firefighters were injured. The fire killed more professional wildland firefighters in the U.S. than any other in the 103 years between the Great Fire of 1910 and the Yarnell Hill Fire in 2013. The Blackwater Fire consumed of old-growth forest dominated by Douglas fir trees on the west slopes of Clayton Mountain. At the time the firestorm occurred, the temperatures were about and the relative humidity was only 6 percent. Though most of the firefighters consisted of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) employees, they were led by more experienced United States Forest Service (USFS) fire managers. Firefighters in the first half of the 20th century used mostly hand tools to suppress wildfires, and all gear was carried by the firefighters or by pack animals. Weather forecasting and radio communication were generally poor or nonexistent. Investigations and analysis of the event led the USFS to develop better ways to provide a more immediate response to combat fires; one of them was the development of the smokejumper program in 1939. Additionally, the Ten Standard Firefighting Orders, a standardized set of wildland firefighting principles, were developed in 1957. A year after the tragedy, survivors and their fellow employees constructed several memorials at the scene of the incident. Geographical setting Blackwater Creek originates on the north slope of Sheep Mesa at an altitude of in Shoshone National Forest and flows north through Blackwater Canyon. The creek is long and descends a steep gradient before it empties into the North Fork Shoshone River, across from U.S. Routes 14/16/20 immediately west of Mummy Cave and east of the border of Yellowstone National Park. The firestorm deaths occurred on the west slopes of Clayton Mountain, approximately south by trail into the canyon. The canyon consists of numerous ravines and small ridges, which form a washboard landscape shaped by extensive erosion of the volcanic igneous rock that constitutes the Absaroka Range. The canyon has moderate to steep slopes with a gradient of 20 to 60 percent. The regional flora is an upper montane mixed- conifer forest dominated by Douglas fir trees. When the fire swept through the area the forest was dense and mature with heavy fuel loads from dead trees, which also had dead limbs extending to the ground, providing a fuel ladder for fire to easily spread into the tree tops. Early 20th-century firefighting Firefighters use backpack water pumps and hand tools on the Blackwater Fire. In 1937, firefighters did not have portable radios for rapid on-scene communication or helicopters to bring supplies and provide water drops. Firefighters had some access to gas-powered portable water pumps (two were set up on the Blackwater Fire), but most used backpack pumps that were manually operated and held limited water. Firelines were dug by handcrews using shovels, axes and pulaskis (a tool that could be used as either an axe or a hoe). Most firefighters wore cotton and wool clothing, which provided poor protection from flames. Additionally, they did not have fire shelters, which first became available in the 1960s but were not mandatory until 1977. Later researchers believe the use of shelters might have saved lives depending on where the firefighters were when the firestorm occurred. The steepness and ruggedness of the terrain in Blackwater Canyon meant firefighters had to access the fire on foot, carrying all their supplies. On the Blackwater Fire, pack horses were used to ferry supplies from the access roads to an upper base camp. Many of the firefighters were employed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and had limited training in wildfire suppression and behavior, as the CCC was mainly engaged in construction projects. After a series of severe and deadly forest fire events in the early 20th century, officials established the 10 am rule in 1935, which recommended aggressive attack on all fires and to have them controlled by 10 am, the day after they are first detected. This was intended to prevent fires from remaining active into the afternoon when the rising temperatures and more turbulent air caused fires to expand and become more erratic. A scientific publication about fire behavior that could be used for widespread training of firefighters first became available in 1951. Fighting the Blackwater Fire =Detection and firefighter response= The Blackwater Fire was started by a lightning strike on August 18, 1937, but it remained undetected until early August 20, at which time it was estimated to be about in size. By the evening, it had expanded to , and 65 firefighters from the United States Forest Service (USFS), which included CCC company 1852 from the Wapiti Ranger District of Shoshone National Forest and employees of the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR), were constructing fire lines along two flanks of the fire. A gas-powered portable pump was delivered and set up using water from Blackwater Creek by midnight. Another pump arrived after that and firefighters installed of hose line on the north flank of the fire and another on the west flank. CCC workers from the National Park Service arrived at 2:30 am on August 21 and started construction of fire line along the north flank of the fire. Meanwhile, increasing winds had begun expanding the fire to the east. Blackwater fire at approximately 4 pm on August 21, 1937 Fire officials believed they needed more manpower, so CCC crews from Bighorn National Forest, to the east, and other districts of Shoshone National Forest started responding by the morning of August 21. By 12:30 pm, more than 200 firefighters were on duty and involved in digging fire line or in support of the firefighting effort. Along one of the small creeks flowing into Blackwater Creek, a small dam was constructed to pocket water supplies for use in backpack water pumps. Due to a long overnight journey, the CCC members from the Tensleep District of Bighorn National Forest did not commence response to the fire until after noon on August 21. As they arrived, the Tensleep CCC unit were told to relieve the Wapiti CCC unit that had been fighting the fire since the previous evening. More than 50 firefighters commenced construction of a new fire line along Clayton Creek and Clayton Gulch, a ravine extending east from Blackwater Creek. The construction was led by USFS Rangers Alfred Clayton and Urban Post, and their crews consisted mainly of the Tensleep CCC camp and some from other entities. Radio transmissions from Idaho to a weather service office in Riverton, Wyoming, indicated a dry weather front had pushed through and was heading east. It is believed that forest managers at the Wapiti ranger station received this information, but it did not reach the men on the fire lines because of a lack of radio lines. The USFS did have spotters in an aircraft providing aerial observation of the fire behavior that was radioed to the Wapiti ranger station. At 12:40 pm on August 21, several spot fires were reported near the fire lines by aerial observers. At 1 pm, the weather at Wapiti was with an extremely low relative humidity of 6 percent. Winds blowing generally from the southwest increased to as the dry front approached at 3:30 pm. At 3:45 pm, they shifted abruptly from southwest to west, causing increased crowning and spot fires over the fire lines. Convectional winds also increased and the fire front started up the drainage heading east. =Firefighters trapped by firestorm= Clayton Gulch after the fire USFS fire manager Urban Post was leading the Tensleep CCC crews in and passed USFS crew fire crew boss Alfred Clayton, who had only one firefighter with him. Post left six men to assist Clayton and the other firefighter so they could help suppress small fires that were spotting over the fire lines. Post then led his crews east up a ridge but saw more spot fires below where Clayton and his crew were. Clayton also saw the spot fires and moved to suppress them. At 4 pm, the spot fires started to crown and Clayton sent a handwritten note to Post requesting additional manpower. By the time the note reached Post, the firestorm commenced, racing east up the ravines and gullies and trapping Clayton and his crew near the dam they had built. There, Clayton and six others died. The eighth firefighter in his crew was rescued but died later in the hospital. Post led more than 40 firefighters, consisting of USFS, CCC, and BPR employees, up the ridge seeking an opening in the forest to take refuge. Spot fires blew ahead of Post and his crews preventing them from advancing further up the ridge, but they found a rocky outcropping and lay prone on the ground as the fire engulfed them. Crammed together on the outcropping, Post's men moved around to avoid the flames and USFS employee Paul Tyrrell (who later died) used his own body to keep several CCC firefighters from panicking and to shield them from the fire. The flames and heat nevertheless drove five firefighters to charge the flames in an attempt to escape to the other side of the firefront, but only one of them survived. A total of nine firefighters were killed on the fire lines and six more died later from their burns, while another 38 suffered various injuries. The Blackwater Fire is tied for fourth involving the greatest loss of life by firefighters on a wildfire in U.S. history. It killed more professional wildland firefighters in the U.S. than any other in the 103 years between the Great Fire of 1910 and the Yarnell Hill Fire in 2013. =Rescue and body recovery= News of the deaths and injuries started reaching the fire camps by 6 pm on August 21; by then the fire had calmed down as the dry front had passed and the wind decreased. Post led his party down through the burned area and calls went out for medical assistance. By that night, another 150 firefighters and rescue personnel had reached the fire. Rescue efforts commenced as soon as reports arrived and by the morning of August 22, almost 500 firefighters and rescue workers were on scene. The fire consumed but was not fully controlled until August 24. After 7 pm on August 21, the first fatalities were discovered by a team led by Paul Krueger of the USFS. They came upon a surviving member of Clayton's crew, finding him badly burned. Before succumbing to his injuries, he was able to direct rescuers to where Clayton and the other crew members were last seen. Post informed the rescue team that two of his party would have to be carried out and his men were too weary to do so; these two also died at the hospital. The following morning, the bodies of two other members of Post's crew that had tried to run through the flames were found. The rugged terrain made it necessary for the deceased to be carried out on either stretchers or slung over pack horses. The procession of pack horses carrying the recovered bodies passed through the fire camps where other firefighters were preparing to combat the fire. Aftermath =Fire investigation and results= The fatalities on the Blackwater Fire led the federal government to initiate their earliest rigorous investigation on such an event. The USFS investigation of the Blackwater fire incident was led by David Godwin, Assistant Chief of Fire Control for the USFS. His conclusions were that the firefighters were in good physical condition and most had some experience fighting forest fires. Godwin also determined that the managers on the incident were all fully trained and experienced firefighting professionals. Godwin stated that no fault should be assigned to the fire managers as the situation was beyond their control. He indicated that because of the distances involved in getting enough manpower to combat the fire while it was still relatively small (the Tensleep CCC crews had to travel ), the fire was not contained enough to prevent the rapid spread that occurred when the weather front approached. Godwin's findings indicated that rapid deployment of firefighters was critical to successful fire suppression. These findings were reinforced by A. A. Brown, head of the Division of Fire Control in the Forest Service's Rocky Mountain Region, who studied the fire behavior and the responses to the Blackwater fire. Dedication ceremony of the Blackwater fire roadside memorial along U.S. Routes 14/16/20 In an era when all fire was considered detrimental and with limited studies that documented the important ecological role of fire, immediate suppression using aggressive attack was considered the best way to protect the forests. Godwin believed that parachuting firefighters from airplanes as soon as fires were detected and as near to the fire as possible would provide the fastest way to get firefighters in place before a fire raged out of control. Consequently, by 1939 the first stages of the parachuting smokejumper program were initiated at Winthrop, Washington, and at two locations in Montana. A later review of 16 fatal fires, from the Blackwater Fire in 1937 through 1956, led managers of the USFS to implement the Ten Standard Firefighting Orders in 1957, which were later changed to FIREORDERS in 1987, with each letter designating one of the ten orders. Not long after the Ten Standard Firefighting Orders were implemented, 18 Watchout Situations were also developed to increase firefighter safety. Decades after the Blackwater Fire, forest managers had developed a better understanding of the ecological role of fire. Consequently, in 1977, the USFS dropped the 10 am rule from their firefighting strategic planning, and shifted their emphasis away from wildfire suppression to wildfire management. =Memorials= In 1938, several monuments were erected by members of the CCC to honor those killed and injured during the Blackwater Fire. The largest and most accessible is along U.S. Route 14/16/20. Another memorial was erected the same year near the location where Alfred Clayton and his crew perished. A third memorial was placed where Urban Post and his crews waited out the firestorm on the rocky ledge that was later named Post Point. Clayton also had several geographic locations named in his honor, including Clayton Mountain. Though only the roadside monument can be reached by car, the other two monuments can be visited by trail, which is a round-trip hike. The James T. Saban Lookout is a fire lookout tower renamed in 2015 in honor of one of the fallen firefighters.

One of its founders was Antonio D√≠az Soto y Gama, one of the founders of the Liberal Party of Mexico (PLM).Samuel Brunk, The Posthumous Career of Emiliano Zapata. Austin: University of Texas Press 2008, p. 65. COM served as a cultural institution promoting worker's education and social transformation through a rationalist, socialist orientation, and as the headquarters for a number of syndicates and unions on a mutual aid basis.  Formation and the revolution  The Casa del Obrero Mundial was founded in the capital in July 1912, during the presidency of Francisco I. Madero; its founders included Antonio D√≠az Soto y Gama, Manuel Sarabia, and L√°zaro Guti√©rrez.Charles C. Cumberland, Mexican Revolution: The Constitutionalist Years. Austin: University of Texas Press 1972, p. 252. The Casa del Obrero Mundial was at the center of the Mexican labor movement in the early 20th century, and was nourished in part by Spanish anarchosyndicalist exiles of the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo. At the time, the Mexican labor movement was relatively advanced, and though it was not a predominantly industrial economy its non-peasant workers were fairly conscious of popular struggle and their weight in society.James Cockcroft, Mexico: Class Formation, Capital Accumulation, & the State. Monthly Review Press 1992. It was founded in the general uprising of the Mexican Revolution after the long, heavy-handed repression of labor under the Porfiriato. The COM sought abolition of the capitalism and the coordination of worker's syndicates into a confederated socialist economy. In order to do this it engaged in many strikes that struck Mexico before and during the revolution, aiming for its preferred goal of general strike. In a heavily agriculture-based economy, however, its alliance with Mexican campesinos was crucial to its success, but in this aspect it failed, and, through the convoluted situation of the revolution, allied itself with Carranzista forces and formed Red Battalions to fight its supposedly counter-revolutionary enemies, namely the rural-based Zapatistas. After the suppression of Zapata's Morelos Commune, strikes were banned by Carranza and the House went into decline, ultimately pushed out of the labor opposition by labor unions more under government control, such as the CROM.

Wells. It was originally published in the Pall Mall Budget (6 September 1894), and then included in the collection The Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents, published by Methuen & Co. in 1895, and subsequently in his Complete Short Stories. It deals with what Wells describes as \\"certain odd possibilities of the negro mind brought into abrupt contact with the crown of our civilisation\\" and the narration displays racist attitudes common among British society of the time, in addition to the overt thuggish racism of the character Holroyd. Plot summary Azuma-zi, a character of ill-defined but dark-skinned race, apparently of South-East Asian origin, arrives in London from the Straits Settlements on board a steamer where he was a stoker. He speaks no English and is bewildered by the turmoil of London; he loses all the money he has earned serving on the steamer and eventually finds work, again as a stoker, in a power station at Camberwell which supplies power to an underground electric railway (given the date of publication, this can only be the City and South London Railway, although the power station supplying this line was actually at Stockwell). The power station is in the charge of one James Holroyd, an electrician from Yorkshire. He is a bully and a racist; he drinks whisky while on duty and beats Azuma-zi with a rod of copper wire. He is irreligious; he lectures Azuma-zi against religion, and suggests to him that the largest and most impressive of the three dynamos in the plant is more of a \\"Gord\\" than the one preached by missionaries. Azuma-zi is powerfully impressed by the humming, whirling machinery and comes to believe that the big dynamo is indeed a god. He starts to worship it; he salaams to it when he arrives at work, prays to it to save him from Holroyd, cleans and polishes it with devotional care, and anoints it with oil - by which he unintentionally damages an area of the insulating varnish on the coils, and on discovering this Holroyd orders him to stay away from the machine with threats of violence. Holroyd's bullying and Azuma-zi's dynamo worship combine to convince Azuma-zi that his god disapproves of Holroyd and eventually that it desires Holroyd as a human sacrifice. Azuma-zi surprises Holroyd, trips him and throws him against the exposed live terminals on the end of the dynamo, where he is electrocuted. Investigation of Holroyd's death is extremely perfunctory; the police are not called, Holroyd is presumed to have committed suicide, and nobody thinks to suspect Azuma-zi of murder. Holroyd is replaced by a character named only as \\"the scientific manager\\"; in contrast to Holroyd's bullying, he takes very little notice of Azuma-zi at all. Nevertheless, impressed by the swift death inflicted on Holroyd by the dynamo, Azuma-zi decides to make the scientific manager a sacrifice as well. The scientific manager fights back, and manages to keep himself clear of the live parts until a third person happens to arrive on the scene, at which Azuma-zi panics, abandons the struggle and seizes the live terminals in his own hands. Racism While Holroyd is depicted as a thuggish, unthinking bully who \\"liked a nigger [as an assistant] because he would stand kicking\\", the narration, although sympathetic to Azuma-zi, nevertheless describes him in terms that would be considered unacceptable in modern times. He is described as a \\"savage\\" and a \\"mere black\\", and it is implied that his worship of the dynamo is not merely the result of culture shock, but also owes something to the \\"negro mind\\".

Early history The first records of the castle date from the late 12th century and it is thought that is when the castle was first constructed. Far less grand than it is today, the original castle consisted only of basic walls and two towers. Over subsequent centuries, the castle had a number of owners including members of the House of Savoy. A family of local nobility (House of Roncas, or Maison de Roncas in French) purchased the castle in the 17th century and it was that family that expanded the castle into a large fortified residence.Saint-Pierre Castle (Museo Regionale di Scienze Naturali / Mus√©e r√©gional des sciences naturelles) Later history Thereafter, the castle fell into disrepair until its purchase by baron Emanuele Bollati in the 1870s.

Chen Pokong, as one the most prominent student leaders, then co- organized the massive 1986 students movement in Shanghai calling for democracy. In 1989, Chen Pokong initiated and organized a large-scale democracy movement in Guangzhou. After establishing a \\"democracy salon\\" in Sun Yat-sen University in January, on April 22, 1989, Chen Pokong joined Chen Wei, Yu Shiwen and other student leaders in launching student protests in Guangzhou in support of the student protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.

As a speaker in opposition, Chen Pokong pointed out: \\"While China exerts influence beyond its borders, I do not believe that China is interested in benefiting the world, but instead in China‚Äôs own self-interest, especially that of the Red Elite. \\"\\"As the world‚Äôs second-largest economy and newest superpower, China‚Äôs overseas impact is growing by the day. However, its methods, processes, and results all show that, generally, China‚Äôs overseas impact is not constructive, but rather destructive; and that China is not contributing to world peace, but rather introducing danger and risk to the world. \\"Oxford Union Chen Pokong was invited by The Cambridge Union to join a debate on May 3, 2018. The subject of the debate was This House Believes The Future Belongs To The East. As a speaker in opposition, Chen Pokong pointed out: \\"China‚Äôs single-party totalitarian government has killed the creativity of its people. Most of China‚Äôs technology has come from plagiarizing, pirating and stealing technology from the West. Other technology has come from acquiring Western companies together with their core technologies. It is shameless for Chinese government to show off its so-called ‚ÄúGreat Technological Leap‚Äù, because almost all of China's technology comes from the West.\\"\\"One of the prerequisites for free trade is the free flow of information. How can other countries expect China to lead free trade when it closes itself off from free information? Establishing the Great Firewall to isolate Chinese people from the rest of the world is extreme isolationism. \\"\\"For China, being prosperous and powerful, this is not the first time nor the last. In the history of thousands of years, there have been many times. However, because the political system has never changed, dictatorship, dictatorship, then dictatorship, power has never been constrained, finally resulting in unavoidable official corruption. Each time, a prosperous and powerful China had become a cloud of smoke. Today‚Äôs China, continuing to reject democracy and the rule of law, will certainly repeat the failure of history.\\" Works Chen Pokong was an assistant professor of economics at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, when the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations began in China.

He fled to Hong Kong and applied for political asylum, but was rejected. After being repatriated he was sent to forced labor. In a letter to the international community in 1994, Chen alleged that prisoners in the Guangzhou No. 1 Reeducation-Through-Labor-Center were often beaten and \\"subjected to conditions which amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.\\" Chen had the letter smuggled out of the camp in the latter half of 1994, when it was reported on by international human rights groups. He said that production quotas force prisoners to work over 14 hours a day, 7 days a week, with only 3 days of holiday per year. Heavy labor is done during the daytime, including transporting and loading stones from a quarry to a boat. At night, prisoners were forced to make artificial flowers for export, according to Chen's letter. The food supplied by camp authorities was often insufficient and consisted of \\"coarse rice and rotten vegetables,\\" according to Amnesty International. Part of Chen's letter said: \\"Inmates who labour slightly slower are brutally beaten and misused by supervisors and team leaders (themselves inmates). Inmates are often beaten until they are blood- stained all over, collapse or lose consciousness (shortly before I was sent here, one inmate was beaten to death.)... Many inmates, including myself, their hands and feet squashed by big stones, stained with blood and pus, have to labour as usual. As a consequence, many inmates were crippled for life.\\" In his letter, he said the Guangdong No. 1 Reform Through Labor, Quarry 1, Company 9 in Chini Town, Hua County, Guangdong was the \\"most vicious,\\" and that he was sent there so the Guangdong authorities could \\"vent their bitter hatred on me.\\" In a House Congressional testimony on the subject of Chinese forced labor, Nancy Pelosi characterized Chen's letter as \\"a compelling appeal for help, relating the terrible tale of ill treatment and slave labor\\" in Chinese prison camps.Full text of Chen Pokong's letter, submitted by Nancy Pelosi, Congressional Record Volume 140, Number 143 (Wednesday, October 5, 1994), House, Chinese Forced Labor.

It includes over 26 stores and services. Anchor stores are Belk, JCPenney, and Roses and a cinema owned by AMC Theatres. History The mall is part of a retail business concentration that developed along U.S. 25E beginning in the late 1960s. It opened in October 1983 with Belk, JCPenney, Kmart and an array of specialty merchants. The mall's first owner was David Hocker and Associates. The mall is an important retail center for a large rural area in the mountains of eastern Kentucky and nearby Tennessee. Sears joined the mall in June 1987 with a store, then added another in 1989. Kmart closed on June 1, 2002. Steve & Barry's opened in place of Kmart in 2006 but closed in 2009 following bankruptcy in the midst of the economic downturn. Roses opened to fill the Kmart store in 2010. Sears left in November 2012 and opened a new store north of the Mall on U.S. Route 25E. On June 4, 2020, JCPenney announced that this location would close as part of a plan to close 154 stores nationwide.https://companyblog.jcpnewsroom.com/storeclosings/ Since 2004, the mall has been owned by Ershig Properties, which is based in Henderson, Kentucky.http://www.ershigproperties.com Literacy programs Middlesboro Mall has a history of supporting community literacy programs. The mall's use as a site for adult literacy classes was cited in a 1993 academic paper as an example of the function of shopping malls as \\"public spaces\\" for their communities. The Children's Reading Foundation of Appalachia-KY has used the facility for Read Across America events and local events such as Malloween, Books with Santa, and a back-to-school fashion show. In 2013, the mall management announced that, after observing the importance of these activities for the community, it was donating space in the mall to house offices of the Children's Reading Foundation.

In 1940, the population was 8,400 but within five years, it more than doubled its size. The Las Vegas Valley had a population of 13,937 in 1940, increasing to 35,000 in just two years. 1940‚Äì44 In the early 1940s, the town experienced political problems resulting in two city governments, each claiming to have the right to rule. The militarization of Las Vegas began when the Army Gunnery School (now Nellis Air Force Base) was established in 1941; between 1941‚Äì45, 55,000 students attended classes here. The city of Henderson was established in 1941.Rothman, p. 77 During the World War II period, when defense spending was high, tourist traffic to Las Vegas necessitated raising of many new buildings on the Fifth street, Fremont Street and many other prime roads leading to the casinos. During the 40s and also in the 50s the resort sector also developed in a big way to the detriment of the residential houses in many of the residential streets. Suburbs with single family housing complexes and apartment blocks sprung up behind El Rancho and other hotels on The Strip. The city also modified its grid pattern layout, as the city extended southwards and realigned in north-south direction. As the casinos came into existence on the Strip along the Fremont street, the commercial establishments were moved to the Main Street and Commerce Street. In 1940, the Clark Inn Motel was built as a Regency modern type hotel. In the same year, the Chief Hotel came into existence as a remodeled version of the mission hotel. Both these were built on the Charleston Boulevard in the 1200 block. During the second World War period, the Las Vegas Boulevard witnessed proliferation of wedding chapels, auto courts and motels. In 1940, the hotel magnate of California, Hull was invited by James Cashman of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce to build one of his El Rancho Hotels with casino, which would be profitable. Cashman and his associates showed him a number of sites. But Hull had his own preference and built the El Rancho Las Vegas hotel at a large site of his choice. He built the hotel with a sprawling casino, coffee shops upscale restaurants, well-turned gardens and parks, swimming pool and a large parking lot which could accommodate 500 cars. Following this hotel, the next seven years witnessed the emergence of Last Frontier, Flamingo and Thunderbird hotels. It was built in the low rise western architectural style at the early developmental stage of The Strip. The El Rancho Vegas opened in 1941 on what became the Las Vegas Strip, serving as the model for future casinos. In 1942, Clark Gable was staying at the El Rancho when he learned that his wife Carole Lombard was in a commercial airplane crash near Las Vegas at Goodsprings, Nevada, in which there were no survivors. In 1941, John Grayson established the El Cortez Hotel and Casino. The Arizona Club, also known as the \\"Queen of Block 16\\", was the first Las Vegas saloon to have second story constructed for prostitution and was unchallenged until 1941. In 1942, Las Vegas closed its prostitution district, accommodating a request from the military, and by December 1942, bars and casinos were closed for an eight- hour period, starting at 2:00 AM.Rothman, p. 313 The West Side Club opened for African American customers in the early 1940s as, in 1942, Las Vegas city commissioners denied a permit for an interracial hotel-casino in the Downtown area. The Hotel Last Frontier was established in 1942. Its Western Frontier Village contained The Little Church of the West where Betty Grable and Harry James married in 1943. By 1944, the Army base's training range had been enlarged to 3.3 million acres. A riot in that year, resulting from an altercation between the police and black GIs who wanted to enter downtown bars and casino.Rothman, p. 264 The Huntridge Theater was built in 1944. At 16.5 percent of the labor pool, women made up a small minority of workers in 1940, numbering slightly more than 1,000. About half were in service, sales, or clerical work with thirteen percent in professional jobs, 10 percent working as proprietors or managers, another 10 percent engaged in domestic service, and the balance working in some operative business. In the decade of the 1940s, though the number of women of working age women increased 196 percent, their participation in the workfoce increased 413 percent. 1945‚Äì49 The post-war era was one of celebration for Las Vegas's tourism industry as all war period restrictions were lifted and tourist traffic boomed. A colorful feature of entertainment in the Last frontier in 1945 was the dancing shows of chorus girls. One of the chorus leading girl became the entertainment director of El Rancho Vegas. In 1945, Nevada Power Company noted that 77 million kilowatt-hours of electricity were being used by its customers. This more than doubled in two years, reaching almost 160 million kilowatt-hours.Rothman, p. 103 In December 1946, the Flamingo Hotel was opened by Bugsy Siegel and in the following year, the \\"Howdy, Pardner\\" city symbol (nicknamed Vegas Vic) was erected. Rededicated by an act of Congress in 1947, the Boulder Dam was renamed the Hoover Dam. By 1948, the Strip contained several casinos, including the El Rancho, Last Frontier, Fabulous Flamingo, and Thunderbird (later renamed Silverbird). Las Vegas' expansion beset the town with water shortages such that faucets ran dry at the Las Vegas Hospital in 1949. In the same year, the Nevada Natural Gas Company began coordination of a natural gas pipeline between the city and Topock, Arizona.Rothman, p. 104 With the dramatic growth of Las Vegas, the increasing water supply needs of the city and the county was brought to focus in 1946, in view of the county's inadequate ground water potential to meet the demand. Lake Mead was identified as a potential solution to the problem. The dismal sanitary conditions of the city was also discussed and sought to be resolved. In January 1946, efforts made by some lobbies to lift the ban on prostitution were turned down on health grounds. During World War II, the Rockwell Field which was a civilian airport of Las Vegas and Clark County since 1926 was closed and the new airport became a military base of the U.S. Army Air Corps from 1941 and functioned as \\"flexible gunnery training school\\". This airport was named as McCarran Airport, in honour of Patrick McCarran, the then U.S. senator of Nevada. After the war, the gunnery school was closed but the air force, in 1947, wanted to continue operating the airport for military purposes only. As a result, a new civilian airport location had to be chosen. This was selected at the Alamo Field. Clark County bought this land from its owner George Crockett but permitting him to retain his business in the airport. After the war ended, as part of tourism promotion, a new county airport was built starting with a referendum in May 1947 and commissioned on 19 December 1948. It served for 15 years till the jet planes made the airport ineffective. The stone pillars which marked the entrance to the old McCarran Airport were shifted to the new airport and rededicated to McCarran. Railroad underpasses were also planned and built by the Municipal authorities, and one such underpass which was built in 1949 on the Las Vegas western lands at West Charleston which was aimed to achieve the goal of extending the city westwards.

The h is silent, the An is slightly emphasized, the DA is stressed, and the O in l√≥n is accentuated. English and Spanish are the official present-day articulations of this surname. In the 12th century (1100s), there are early mentions of Andalo in northern Italy in descriptions of a historical Roman Catholic Church, its surrounding location, and the people living in the area.Girardi, S. (1973). Azienda autonoma di soggiorno di Molveno, Andalo e Fai della Paganella. Bologna: Edizioni Dehoniane. Istituto di scienze religiose in Trento.Cristoforetti, G. (1989). La Visita pastorale del cardinale Bernardo Clesio alla diocesi di Trento, 1537-1538. Bologna: Edizioni Dehoniane. Istituto di scienze religiose in Trento. The historical archives show that in references to Andalo, other iterations are used, such as di Andalo, Andaloni, and Andalone. Documents from this time period highlight people identifying as such, either through their first or last names. Members of this early Italian community appear to have migrated to neighboring regions, including Asturias in northern Spain. The spelling of their main identifying name was changed to Andall√≥n, reflecting the Asturian dialectical customs of the time and the prevalent Castilian Spanish language. Between the 13th and 18th centuries (1200s - 1700s), there are references to Andall√≥n in Asturias, Spain in descriptions of another historical Roman Catholic Church, its immediate environment, and the individuals inhabiting the community.Sanz Fuentes, M.J. y Ruiz de la Pe√±a, J.I.

Bolet√≠n Oficial del Principado de Asturias. N√∫m. 27 del mi√©rcoles 3 de febrero de 2010 The historical records show that in this part of Spain, Andall√≥n is also referred to as Anday√≥n. This is the case because both the Asturian dialect and Castilian Spanish language use the double ll and y interchangeably. Starting in the 18th century (1700s) in Guadalajara in New Spain of the Americas, there are people who appear with the Andal√≥n last name.Espa√±a, registros parroquiales y diocesanos, 1307-1985. Images. FamilySearch.com. Par√≥quias Cat√≥licas, Spain (Catholic Church parishes, Spain).Ancestry.com: Mexico and United States, 1700s - 1990s. Andall√≥ns migrated to the Americas and the spelling of their family name changed to Andal√≥n. One l in their name was dropped during the migration experience, reflecting the spelling customs in New Spain and the emerging Mexican Spanish vernacular. Mexico gained its independence from Spain in the early 19th century (the year 1810 was the call for independence; the year 1821 was the official declaration of independence). The historical records also indicate that Andall√≥ns immigrated to other Spanish territories outside of the Americas. In the Americas, the presence of Andal√≥ns continue in the early 19th century (1800s) in Guadalajara and in other central-west Mexican states.Espa√±a, registros parroquiales y diocesanos, 1307-1985. FamilySearch.com Par√≥quias Cat√≥licas, Spain.Ancestry.com: Mexico and United States, 1700s - 1990s. Beginning in the late 19th century (1890s), throughout the 20th century (1900s), and currently in the 21st century (2000s), we see Andal√≥ns immigrating to and being born in the United States.U.S. Naturalization Record Indexes, 1791-1992 (Indexed in World Archives Project).Border Crossings: From Mexico to U.S., 1895-1964 (Border Crossings and Passports) Texas, Birth Index, 1903-1997 Birth, Baptism, and ChristeningCalifornia, Birth Index, 1905-1995 Birth, Baptism, and Christening In the United States, both the accented and unaccented versions of this last name have been used. At the present time, individuals with the last name Andalon live on the West Coast of the United States, primarily in the :State of California and mostly in the :City of Los Angeles and neighboring municipalities. Andal√≥ns also live in central-west Mexico, specifically in the State of :Jalisco and mainly in the City of :Guadalajara, as well as in adjacent Mexican states. Over the years, they have settled in other regions of the United States and Mexico. While Andalons have lived in the United States about 100 years and in Mexico over 300 years, Italy and Spain is where they draw their early ancestry, which can be traced back several hundred years. The subsequent section provides a detailed account of the Andalon surname after its early Italian heritage, focusing on its extensive and well-documented history in Spain, Mexico, and the United States. In Spain, over several hundred years in :es:Las Regueras, a municipality of Asturias, Andalon (or Andall√≥n) has been used to identify a town, river, street, church, religious festival, military fortress, nobility residence, governmental palace, and Roman relic.Torner, J.

Spanish archives from the early 1600s to the late 1700s document Andalon as the last name of individuals in records pertaining to township residents, church parishioners, marriages, births, baptisms, deaths, and burials. These records come from the following northern communities of Spain: Las Regueras and Oviedo, Asturias; Montemayor de Pililla, Valladolid; Pembes and Mogrovejo, Santander; and Pamplona, Navarra. In the early- to mid-1700s and through the 1800s, the last name Andalon is seen in the Americas, specifically in records concerning the inhabitants of western Spanish territories that eventually became municipalities of Mexico, including: Guadalajara, Jalisco; Encarnacion de Diaz, Jalisco; Ameca, Jalisco; Tequila, Jalisco; Jalostotitlan, Jalisco; Teuchitlan, Jalisco; and Ahualulco de Mercado, Jalisco. While not as prevalent as in the state of Jalisco, the last name Andalon also appears in the archival records of these neighboring Mexican States: Nayarit, Aguascalientes, and San Luis Potos√≠. During the mid-1800s, the last name Andalon also begins appearing in official Mexican populace governmental records; that is, in non-church related records. Complementing existing Spanish Catholic Church archives, these Mexican civil documents provide information related to places of residence, parents and siblings, birth dates, marriages, baptisms, deaths, and other census-related demographics. In the United States, primarily in the southwestern states of California and Texas, the last name Andalon appears in Government Census and Immigration Records starting in the 1890s, throughout the 1900s, and currently in the 2000s. In these records, individuals with the surname Andalon are shown as being born in the United States, as well as in official documents relating to United States - Mexico Border Crossing Information. In summary, while Andalons have lived in the United States about 100 years and in Mexico over 300 years, Italy and Spain is where they draw their early ancestry, which can be traced back several hundred years. The varied spellings of this surname throughout history have been Andalo and Andaloni (Italian), Andall√≥n and Anday√≥n (Castilian Spanish), Andal√≥n (Mexican Spanish), and Andalon (American English). Currently, the early derivations of Andalon are reflected in the Italian commune of Andalo in the northern province of Trentino and in the Spanish township of Andall√≥n in the north-west province of Asturias. In Spain, the earlier derivation of Andalon has served as the name of a river, main street, church, religious festival, military fortress, nobility residence, governmental palace, and Roman relic. At the present time, individuals with the last name Andalon live in on the West Coast of the United States, primarily in the :State of California and mostly in the :City of Los Angeles and neighboring municipalities. Andal√≥ns continue to also live in central-west Mexico, specifically in the State of :Jalisco and mainly in the City of :Guadalajara, as well as in adjacent Mexican states. While not prevalent outside these geographic locations, individuals with this last name do live in other regions of the United States and Mexico.

It is known commonly as fodder galega and eastern galega. It is cultivated as a fodder and forage for livestock. This species is native to the Caucasus.Frame, J. Galega orientalis Lam. Grassland Species Profiles. FAO. Its native range includes parts of Russia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. It has been introduced to many other regions for use in agriculture. Description This species is a perennial herb with a taproot and rhizome system. It produces stems up to 2 meters tall which branch near the middle. The leaves are pinnate. The inflorescence bears up to 70 lilac-colored flowers, and some cultivars can produce more.Bale≈æentienƒó, L. (2008). Bio-morphological peculiarities of new cultivars of fodder galega (Galega orientalis Lam.) Agronomijas Vƒìstis 10 82-7. The fruit pod is up to 4 centimeters long and contains up to 8 seeds each a few millimeters in length. Biology The plant can grow on a variety of soil types, performing best on deep, light, friable, well-drained, higher-pH soils. It is quite tolerant of winter cold, but late- season frosts can damage fresh growth. It is somewhat tolerant of drought and flooding. It does not do as well on acidic, peaty, or water-logged soils. It responds well to supplemental phosphorus and potassium.Galega orientalis Lam. AgroAtlas: Interactive Agricultural Ecological Atlas of Russia and Neighboring Countries. Like many other legumes, it fixes nitrogen. Its root nodule bacterium is Rhizobium galegae. Growers must ensure that their seed has been inoculated with it to produce adequate plant growth. Some strains of R. galegae are more effective symbionts than others, and different strains compete on one plant. When a less effective strain outcompetes effective strains, the plant does not grow as well.Tas, E., et al. (1996). Assessment of competitiveness of rhizobia infecting Galega orientalis on the basis of plant yield, nodulation, and strain identification by antibiotic resistance and PCR. Applied and Environmental Microbiology 62(2) 529-35. The rhizome of the plant makes it persistent in the field; the rhizome spreads, sending up new stems, and the plant can live well over ten years, even exceeding 30 years in some areas.Adamovics, A., et al. (2011). Biogas production from Galega orientalis Lam. and galega-grass biomass. Grassland Science in Europe 16 416-18. Ecology The flowers are pollinated by bees. It produces good quantities of nectar and pollen. It makes a good honey plant.Raig, H., et al. Fodder Galega. Eesti Maaviljeluse Instituut, Estonia. 2001. The plant is host to several fungal species, some pathogenic, such as Ascochyta sp., which causes blight, Fusarium oxysporum, which causes Fusarium wilt, and the gray mould Botrytis cinerea. Other species include Humicola brevis, Acremonium strictum, and Cladosporium cladosporioides.Cwalina-Ambroziak, B. and J. Koc. (2005). Fungi colonising the above-ground parts of fodder galega (Galega orientalis Lam.) cultivated in pure sowing and mixed with smooth brome-grass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) Acta Agrobotanica 58(1). Uses This plant is grown to feed livestock. Its potential value as a fodder was first suggested in 1908, and trials began near Moscow in the 1920s. It is productive, persistent, and nutritious, with high protein. It contains high levels of carotene, minerals, and vitamins, especially vitamin C.Bale≈æentienƒó, L. and V. Spruogis. (2011). Experience of fodder galega (Galega orientalis Lam.) and traditional fodder grasses use for forage production in organic farm. Veterinarija ir Zootechnika 56 78. It produces many crops of vegetation, its rhizome continuing to produce stems as it grows. It can be cut down repeatedly and taken for hay and silage, and the stubble can be grazed. The whole plant is not generally suitable for grazing, though. It works well as a companion to a non-competitive grass such as timothy or fescue. In cold northern regions it is valuable because it produces vegetation earlier in the spring and continues later in the fall than some other forages. It is low in toxic alkaloid concentration, making it useful as feed when its alkaloid-rich close relative Galega officinalis is not. The cultivar 'Gale', developed jointly by Estonian and Russian breeders, was released in 1987. The cultivars 'Vidmantai', 'Laukiai', and 'Melsviai' have been bred in Lithuania. The plant has been investigated as a source of biogas, and it has produced a good amount in trials when mixed with grasses and manure. It has been tested as an agent of bioremediation of oil-polluted soils. Some of the bacteria it hosts can degrade soil pollutants such as toluenes.Kaksonen, A. H., et al. (2006). Rhizosphere effect of Galega orientalis in oil-contaminated soil. Soil Biology and Biochemistry 38(4) 817-27. It is also grown as an ornamental plant in gardens.Bourne, V.

He took an interest in acting during primary school and attended various acting schools and workshops. Since graduating from the National Theatre, Joab has appeared in several films and television, including City Homicide, Rush, My Year Without Sex, 10 Terrorists, and Conspiracy 365. In 2011, Joab successfully auditioned for the recurring role of Ajay Kapoor in the soap opera Neighbours. He was later promoted to the main cast. Joab left the show in May 2013. The actor has since appeared in SBS miniseries Better Man and feature film Lion.  Early life  Joab was born in Melbourne, Victoria. His parents divorced when he was five years old. Joab became interested in acting during primary school when he was around seven or eight. He told Tanu Kallivayalil from the Indus Age, \\"My parents like a lot of Indian parents wanted me to do something credible. But I did not want to become a lawyer or doctor or something like that. I wanted to do something that I was passionate about. In fact, I just finished high school because I did not want to make my mum sad.\\" Joab then attended various acting schools and workshops, before he moved to New York to study at the Actors Studio. Joab, who spent his childhood imitating the voices of characters he watched on television, did not need to undergo accent training. On his return to Australia, Joab joined the National Theatre, graduating three years later. He then began appearing in films and theatre productions, before being signed to an agent.  Career  In 2008, Joab made a guest appearance as Raj in the City Homicide episode \\"Examination Day\\". Joab had to put on an Indian accent for the part. The following year, he appeared in an episode of Rush and in the film My Year Without Sex. 2011 saw Joab cast in Big Mamma's Boy and Winston Furlong's Taj, alongside his future Neighbours co-star Coco Cherian. Joab was also cast as Judge Miki Miraj in Dee McLachlan's black comedy 10 Terrorists. Joab joined the cast of Neighbours as Ajay Kapoor in 2011 following a successful audition. On 7 December 2011, it was announced that Joab had been promoted to the regular cast and his on-screen family were being introduced. Following the announcement, several racist posts left on the Neighbours website had to be removed. Speaking to Paul Tatnell from the Herald Sun, Joab blamed the racism on a \\"lack of education\\". He elaborated \\"There is various pockets that will say it is un-Australian to have an Indian or an Indian family on Ramsay St. Those Aussies who are saying it is un-Australian will be the same ones who pretty much supported the White Australia policy back in the day, you are never going to get away from that kind of stuff.\\" Joab left Neighbours at the end of his contract in May 2013 to pursue acting work in Los Angeles. Joab starred in the twelve-part series Conspiracy 365 as Bruno in 2012. He also appeared as Inspector Ramesh in the SBS four-part miniseries Better Man, which began airing from 25 July 2013. That same year, he filmed a role in the 2014 film The Legend Maker. Joab made a guest appearance in Childhood's Endin 2015. He was also cast in the drama film Lion, alongside Rooney Mara and Dev Patel. In April 2016, Joab spoke out about having to put on an Indian accent when he attends auditions in Australia. That same year, Joab played the lead role of Amir Kapoor in the Sydney Theatre Company (STC) production of Disgraced.

It is a Germanic name consisting of the two elements hadu \\"battle, combat\\" and wig \\"fight, duel\\". The name is on record since the 9th century, with Haduwig, a daughter of Louis the German. The name remained popular in German high nobility during the 10th and 11th centuries. Other medieval spellings include Hathuwic, Hathewiga, Hadewich, Hadewic, Hathwiga, Hadwich, Hatwig, Hadwig, Hediwig, Hedewiga, Hedewich, Hedewiih, Hatuuih, Hetvic, Haduwich, Hadawich, Hatuwig, etc. Forms such as Hadiwih, Hadewi etc. suggest that the name is the result of a conflation of two separate names, one with the second element wig \\"fight\\", the other with the second element wih \\"hallowed\\".F√∂rstemann, Altdeutsches Namenbuch (1900:647). The Dutch form is Hadewych (Hadewijch). A German and Dutch diminutive is Hedy.

It is broadcast on ITV and hosted by Julia Bradbury. The show began airing on 22 July 2013 for a 30-episode run as a summer replacement for The Chase and finished on 30 August 2013. Format The show consists of three stages, with the aim primarily being to keep as many hourglasses from draining as possible, each timer containing different amounts of cash. In each episode four contestants compete against each other with the aim of answering as many questions correctly as possible. =Main round= At the start a question is posed to the player on the far left of the studio, The contestant can choose to Stick or Twist, depending on whether they think they know the answer or not. If they decide to Stick, they will answer the question themselves, however if they decide to Twist, they choose which of the other players will answer the question. Whichever option they choose, the three options to the question will then appear. If a player sticks and answers correctly, they get to light a Twister, but if incorrect, control passes to the next player in the line. If they Twist and the player the question is passed to gets the answer correct, they get to light a Twister, but if incorrect, the player who chose to Twist gets to light a Twister instead. Once the sixth Twister is lit, the player in control gets to 'Take on the Twisters' to bank some money. They face 60 seconds of quick-fire general knowledge questions, with the idea to keep as many of the Twisters in play as possible. Once the time is up, the values of the Twisters remaining in play are revealed and the total amount of money is placed in the contestant's bank. This is repeated 4 times each show. =Final Twist= The contestant who has banked the highest amount of cash from the main round goes through to play the \\"Final Twist\\" where they can win whatever they have banked in the main game. In this round, all 8 Twisters are in play and the idea is to keep as many of them in play as possible after 60 seconds of quick-fire questions. When the time is up, Julia will offer ¬£200 (¬£250 in later episodes) for each Twister that remains in play, for example if the player has 5 Twisters in play, ¬£1000 (¬£1250 under the ¬£250 a Twister rule) will be offered. The contestant's money has been placed behind one of the Twisters by an independent adjudicator. One by one, the Twisters in play are revealed to determine whether the money is there. If it is not there, a red \\"X\\" will appear on the display, but if the money is there, a gold \\"WIN\\" will appear. =The Twisters= There are eight \\"Twisters\\" in the show. The colours are red, yellow, blue, orange, green, pink, white, and purple, each worth different amounts of cash ranging from ¬£300 to ¬£1,000. The Twisters containing more cash will drain more quickly. If the values of all eight Twisters are revealed, then their amounts are worth double and will remain doubled for the rest of the game.

According to attack pieces in The Satirist, or Monthly Meteor, he was \\"countenanced\\" by Matthew \\"Monk\\" Lewis and Thomas Moore, and frequented the green room of Drury Lane Theatre until Charles Mathews and other actors complained he was spying for scandalmonger Anthony Pasquin. Gilliland's 1806 pamphlet Diamond cut Diamond defended the future George IV, then Prince of Wales, against Nathaniel Jefferys's attack, for which the Prince gave him 500 guineas.Breashears 2012 p.9 In 1809, Mary Anne Clarke, the royal mistress of Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany was about to publish scandalous Memoirs, until Gilliland helped arrange a deal to buy and destroy the publishers' copies.Breashears 2012 pp.9‚Äì10 Many attacks on the Duke were published the same year and erroneously rumoured to have been Clarke's memoirs. In 1810 Gilliland collaborated on The Rival Princes, a response to the attacks published in Clarke's name.Breashears 2012 p.17 In 1816 the Prince of Wales, now Prince Regent, granted Gilliland an annuity of ¬£400, formalised by a contract of June 1817.Breashears 2012 p.25 In 1827, Gilliland bought what he claimed was a portrait of Shakespeare, an identification not otherwise supported.; ; Edmund Henry Barker's Literary Anecdotes and Contemporary Reminiscences includes several he heard from Gilliland when both were imprisoned for debt in the Fleet in 1837.Breashears 2012 p.10; Works Gilliland wrote: * A Dramatic Synopsis, containing an Essay on the Political and Moral Use of a Theatre, involving Remarks on the Dramatic Writers of the Present Day and Strictures on the Performers of the two Theatres, London, 1804. John Joseph Knight said it \\"contains some sensible opinions\\". * Elbow Room, a Pamphlet containing Remarks on the shameful Increase of the Private Boxes of Covent Garden, London, 1804.

Problems with its underdeveloped V-8 engine prevented its production. Design and development The D.VII was a response by LFG to continued criticism of the pilot's limited forward and downward view from its fighters. The D.V and D.VI had attempted to address this problem though not very successfully. Since the height of the Mercedes D.III and Benz Bz.IIIa inline engines used in these two designs was part of the problem, LFG decided to install the new 60¬∞ V-8 Benz Bz.IIIb, lowering the cylinders and providing a gap between them. Apart from its engine, the D.VII had much in common with the D.VI, particularly with the original D.VIa variant. It was a single bay biplane with pairs of near-parallel interplane struts and blunt tipped wings of almost constant chord, though less staggered than on the D.VI. The upper wing was carried above the fuselage by a cabane; only this wing mounted ailerons. A small cut-out in its trailing edge above the cockpit enhanced the pilot's view. The vertical tail was rounded, with a deep, wide chord rudder that extended below the fuselage to meet a small ventral fin. Both types had Klinkerrumpf, clinker built fuselages, monocoques constructed with thin overlapping spruce strips over a light wooden internal framework and oval in cross-section. The engine was totally enclosed in the nose, driving a two blade propeller. The D.VII's conventional undercarriage had mainwheels on a single axle, supported by long V-struts to the lower fuselage and a tailskid on the leading edge of the ventral fin. Pilots agreed that the revised forward profile changed the view from poor on the D.VI to excellent on the D.VII. During development the D.VII acquired some of the features of the D.VIb, most noticeably overhung, balanced ailerons. The empennage was also modified to a form close to that of the D.VIb, with a small, lower, and broader fin and broad chord balanced rudder. The tailplane was lowered from the top of the fuselage to its midpoint. Development of the D.VII was interrupted by problems with the Benz engine, itself still under development. Nonetheless the D.VII took part in the second D. competition (for fighter types) held in May 1918. In the end the recurrent engine problems led to the abandonment of development. LFG fitted a second aircraft with a geared version of the Benz engine, a Benz Bz.IIIbm, redesignating it as the LFG Roland D.VIII; this also attended the second D. competition. Its report marked it unfit for series production; the reasons are not recorded, but it is known this geared engine, again in early development, suffered form severe vibration. Variants ;D.VII: direct drive, Benz Bz.IIIbo. One built. ;D.VIII: geared drive, Benz Bz.IIIbm. One built. ;D.XIII: D.VII based but with a K√∂rting Kg.III water cooled V-8 engine. The sole example was first flown in May 1918. Flight tests proved the engine unsatisfactory and it was returned to K√∂rting for modification, with the intention of refitting it. However, the engineless D.XIII was destroyed in a hangar fire that July. One built. ;D.XIV: As D.XIII, but with a Goebel Goe.III 11-cylinder rotary engine. It took part in the second D competition of May 1918 but its unreliable engine denied it production status. One built.

He co-founded the studio Vlambeer with Jan Willem Nijman in 2010, where among games they have developed include Ridiculous Fishing, Luftrausers, and Nuclear Throne.  Early life  Ismail was born in the Netherlands to an Egyptian father and Dutch mother, and was raised as a Muslim.  Vlambeer  Ismail had attended the Utrecht School of the Arts where he met Jan Willem Nijman. The two paired up during a game development course, producing what they thought was a potentially marketable game. When the school demanded rights to the game, both dropped out of the school and co-founded Vlambeer in 2010 as to produce more games without this type of interference. While many of Vlambeer's games were critically well received, the studio was propelled by the overnight success of the 2013 mobile game Ridiculous Fishing, which brought in more than in revenue within six months, helping to financially stabilize Vlambeer and both Ismail and Nijman. Through Vlambeer, Ismail led the development of presskit() and distribute(), free online tools for independent developers to prepare and distribution press kits and marketing materials, demo-ready copies of games, and other materials to press members.  Views  As a Muslim and frequently in contact with members of the video game industry outside of Western and Asian nations, Ismail has spoken about better reaching programmers in developing countries. He has also been strongly critical of policies like the Trump travel ban, which not only has affected his travels into the United States, but which he states puts a great cost towards these programmers from developing countries to attend important industry functions. In 2018, Ismail issued more criticism at the travel ban, as several non-Western or Asian developers were prevented from obtaining travel visas to attend the Game Developers Conference in the United States. In January 2019, Ismail announced the establishment of gamedev.world, a new game developer conference aimed for independent game developers from these affected countries; the inaugural conference was held via online streaming and other virtual conference services in June 2019. In the wake of the cancellation of the physical 2020 Game Developers Conference due to the COVID-19 pandemic, gamedev.world ran several charitable events to help developers who had lost non-refundable payments for attending the conference to help recoup costs.  Accolades  Ismail was given the Ambassador award from the 2018 Game Developers Choice Awards for his activism towards encouraging diversity within video games and helping to support game developers from less-developed countries. Variety named Ismail one of the Most Influential in Videogames in 2018 for his work in creating free tools for independent creators and GamesIndustry.biz named Ismail one of its People of the Year for 2018 for his continued support for engaging with developing countries.  Personal life  Ismail lives in the Netherlands. For five years, he had lived with his wife Adriel Wallick, another game developer, whom he met through his work in video games. With the help of Bungie, the two were virtually engaged within Destiny in October 2016, and were married by November 2017. The two separated by August 2018 and remain friends.

Another convention of G minor symphonies observed in Mozart's No. 25 and No. 40 was the choice of the subdominant of the relative key (B major), E major, for the slow movement; other non-Mozart examples of this practice include J.C.

At the time of its discovery, it was the exoplanet most similar to Earth in terms of mass, radius and mean density. Discovery Kepler-78b is the first planet to be found orbiting the star KIC 8435766 b, now known as Kepler-78. Transits and occultations of an Earth-sized planet in an 8.5-hour orbithttp://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi- bin/DisplayOverview/nph- DisplayOverview?objname=Kepler+78+b&type;=CONFIRMED_PLANET The planet was discovered in 2013 by analyzing data from the Kepler space telescope. The planet was detected as it passed across the surface of its host star, as viewed from Earth, and was also found by the effects of occultation as it passed behind the star. Reflected light from the parent star due to orbital phases was also detected. It was not at first designated as a Kepler object of interest, as data analysis failed to identify it due to its short period. Characteristics =Size, mass and composition= At the time of its discovery, Kepler-78b was the exoplanet most similar to Earth in terms of mass, radius and mean density. The planet is approximately 1.69 times the mass and 1.2 times the radius of the Earth. The acceleration due to gravity on the planet's surface is about 11 m/s2, slightly greater than the surface gravity of Earth. Two independent teams were involved in pioneering work to estimate the mass of the planet. Their estimates were made possible because Kepler-78b's gravity causes a 'wobble' in the orbit of the host star. While the method has been used to characterize gas giants, it is difficult to estimate the mass of Earth-sized exoplanets, because their gravity is too weak to produce a visible influence. In this case, the planet's orbit is close enough to its star to produce a detectable effect. One team, led by Francesco Pepe, used the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher-North (HARPS-N) spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in the Canary Islands to estimate that the planet has a mass 1.86 times that of the Earth and a radius 1.16 times greater. The other, led by Andrew Howard of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, used data from the High Resolution Eschelle Spectrometer on the Keck 1 Telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to estimate the mass as 1.69 times that of the Earth and the radius as 1.2 times larger. Both estimates put the planet's density at about 5.5 grams per cubic centimetre, which is equivalent to that of the Earth and possibly indicative of a rock- iron composition like Earth's. The iron core could build up to 40% of the planet mass. Kepler-78b is most similar to larger high-density, hot exoplanets like Kepler-10b, Kepler-36b and CoRoT-7b. =Environment= Kepler-78b orbits around its parent star once every 8.5 hours. It reflects 20% to 60% of the starlight it receives. Transits and occultation of an Earth-sized planet in an 8.5-hour orbit Due to its extremely close solar orbit, which is about 40 times closer than Mercury is to the Sun, the planet's surface is estimated to be at a temperature of to . This temperature is high enough to have stripped the planet of any stable atmosphere, but the liquid and solid portions of the planet should be stable. According to Francesco Pepe, the planet may be Earth- sized but \\"it can be imagined like a lava planet rather than an Earth-like planet\\". Origin According to Harvard‚ÄìSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics astronomer Dimitar Sasselov, \\"this lava world is an abomination. There‚Äôs no physical way a small world, only 20 percent larger than Earth, could have evolved in that location and there‚Äôs no known mechanism that could have transported it there.

He also wrote extensively on the theatre, and was a printer and publisher. Early life Oxberry was the son of an auctioneer, born on 18 December 1784 in Moorfields, London, opposite Bedlam. After a false start as a pupil of George Stubbs at age 14, he worked in a bookseller's shop, and in the office in Tottenham Court Road of a printer named Seale, an amateur actor. At a stable near Queen Anne Street, and subsequently at the theatre in Berwick Street, he took on parts including Hassan in Castle Spectre (Monk Lewis) and Rosse in Macbeth. Oxberry's indentures were cancelled in 1802, and he appeared under Samuel Jerrold, at the Watford theatre.He played Antonio in the Merchant of Venice. A performance of Dan in John Bull revealed talent in low comedy. He appeared at Sheerness, and played Richard III at Godalming. He joined, as low comedian, Trotter's company (Worthing, Hythe, and Southend theatres).For some time subsequently he made an occasional appearance in Shylock, Hassan, and other characters. More frequently he was seen in parts such as Lope Tocho in the 'Mountaineers,' and Old Frost in the 'Irishman in London.' Metropolitan actor In 1807 Henry Siddons recommended Oxberry to the Kemble management at Covent Garden Theatre. He made his first appearance on 7 November 1807 as Robin Roughhead in Fortune's Frolic, but was not a critical success.On 14 Nov he played Lord Duberly, alias Daniel Dowlas, in The Heir at Law, a part he substituted for that of Zekiel Homespun. After this he disappears from the bills. At the close of the season he was released from his engagement, and went to Glasgow, where he made a success as Sir David Daw in the Wheel of Fortune. In Aberdeen he was tried as Michael Ducas in Adalgitha: he then played other tragic roles. After returning to Glasgow, Oxberry accepted from Raymond an engagement in London at the Lyceum Theatre, then known as the English Opera House, and appeared in a piece by Henry Siddons, called 'The Russian Impostor,' in which he made a success. He was then engaged for the Lyceum by Arnold. An engagement at Drury Lane Theatre followed. and he played for the first time with the burnt-out company at the Lyceum, 25 September 1809, as the Lay Brother in the Duenna.He was, 20 Nov, the original Cuffee, a black servant, in Not at Home, by Robert Charles Dallas; and played, 24 February 1810, John Lump in The Review. The following season he was the original Laglast in Allingham's Transformation, or Love and Law; Daniel, a country fellow, in Masters's Lost and Found; Fabian in Dimond's Peasant Boy; Zedekiah in Arnold's Americans; and Timothy Scamp in Leigh's Where to find a Friend; and in 1811‚Äì12, Sir Charles Canvas in Moore's M.P., or the Blue- Stocking; Dick in Right or Wrong; Gregory in Kenney's Turn out!; Abrahamides in Quadruped, an alteration of The Tailors; and Petro in Arnold's Devil's Bridge. After the opening of the new Drury Lane theatre his name is not mentioned until the end of the season.He played, for Miss Kelly's benefit, Lord Listless in 'Rich and Poor,' and Gregory in an act of 'Killing no Murder.' At Drury Lane he remained until the close of the season of 1819‚Äì20.Playing parts such as John Grouse in the 'School for Prejudice;' Graccho in Massinger's 'Duke of Milan;' Master Stephen in Jonson's 'Every Man in his Humour;' Moses in the 'School for Scandal;' Don Ferolo in the 'Critic;' Slender in the 'Merry Wives of Windsor;' Dominique in 'Deaf and Dumb;' Simon Pure in 'A Bold Stroke for a Wife;' Bullock in the 'Recruiting Officer;' and Job Thornberry in 'John Bull.' He created many original parts in plays, dramatic or musical, by Arnold, Thomas John Dibdin, James Kenney, George Soane, and others.Among those were Sapling in 'First Impressions,' by Horace Smith; Isaac in the 'Maid and the Magpie;' Friar Francis in 'Flodden Field,' an adaptation of Scott's 'Marmion;' Humphrey Gull in Soane's 'Dwarf of Naples;' Jonathan Curry in Moncrieff's 'Wanted a Wife;' Dominie Samson in 'Guy Mannering;' and Friar Tuck in the 'Hebrew,' Soane's adaptation of the 'Talisman.' Oxberry as a comic actor was not always a distinguished performer. He was compared only to John Emery as Tyke, John Lump, Robin Roughhead; his Slender, Sir David Daw, and Petro were held to have been unsurpassed. When Robert William Elliston reduced the salaries at Drury Lane, he refused the offer, and starred at minor theatres (the Surrey, the East London, and Sadler's Wells). Later life Oxberry was for a long time manager of the Olympic, but the experiment collapsed. In December 1821 he took the Craven's Head chophouse at Drury Lane, a house of literary and theatrical resort. Here he died 9 June 1824. His remains were interred in a vault in St. Clement Danes Church, Strand. Works Illustration from Oxberry's Dramatic Biography and Histrionic Anecdotes, 1825‚Äì1826 Oxberry was author of: * The Theatrical Banquet, or the Actor's Budget, 1809, 2 vols. * The Encyclop√¶dia of Anecdote, 1812. * The History of Pugilism, and Memoirs of Persons who have distinguished themselves in that Science, 1814. * The Flowers of Literature, 2nd edit., London, 1824, 4 vols. * Oxberry's Anecdotes of the Stage, London, 1827. He also edited The New English Drama, consisting of 113 plays, with prefatory remarks, in 22 vols. 1818‚Äì24; and wrote The Actress of All Work, played in Bath on 8 May 1819, in which Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin assumed half a dozen different characters. He converted He would be a Soldier of Pilon into The High Road to Success, and produced it at the Olympic. He was responsible for an adaptation of Walter Scott's Marmion, played at an outlying theatre. For a short period he edited the Monthly Mirror, to which, and to The Cabinet, he contributed fugitive pieces. A portrait of Oxberry by Samuel De Wilde, in the Garrick Club, shows him as Petro in Arnold's Devil's Bridge. An engraving of him as Leo Luminati in Oh! this Love is in the Theatrical Inquisitor (vol. i.); and a second, presenting him in private dress, is in Oxberry's Dramatic Biography, a work projected by Oxberry, and edited after his death by his widow; it was published in parts, beginning 1 January 1825. After the completion of the first volume in April 1825 the issue was continued in volumes, and was completed in five vols. in 1826. Family In 1806 Oxberry married, at Southend, a young actress playing minor parts in the Trotter company, Catherine Elizabeth Hewitt.

It has pale grey, smooth bark with leaves that grow in clusters. Its small branches are covered in very fine hair. The tree produces flowers in the early part of the austral summer, and these progress from a pink to purple colour. They are sweetly scented and grow in small bunches on a peduncle. The fruit is round and is attached to a wing that becomes up to 40 mm long. The tree carries fruit between April and August.Ojewole, J. A.

Range and habitat It is found in various types of woodlands and in arid savannas, and its habit varies according to climate and altitude. It may be found on either sandy, acidic or rocky soils. It is native to the North West and Limpopo provinces of South Africa, and is locally present northwards in the African subtropics and tropics. In tropical savanna, it is especially found in miombo and caesalpinoid woodland.Stevenson, Philip C., Thamara K. Dayarathna, Steven R. Belmain, and Nigel C. Veitch. \\"Bisdesmosidic Saponins FromRoots: Evaluation of Deterrency and Toxicity to Coleopteran Storage Pests.\\" Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry (2009) Threats and conservation The species suffers from over-harvesting for use in local medicines.

It is listed on the National Forests Act of 1998 of South Africa, where it is noted as a protected tree. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, has also included the species in their ‚ÄúAdopt a seed - save a species‚Äù campaign. The campaign enables the public to purchase a Violet tree in order to protect the species and assist local communities in Mali. The initiative forms part of the Millennium Seed Bank Partnership. Common uses The uses of the plant include a great variety. In particular there are many different medicinal uses for this tree around Africa. It can be used to treat sicknesses as small as headaches or as severe as arthritis. This tree is also commonly used as pesticide against beetles in stored grains. This technique can be very helpful for small-scale subsistence farmers in Africa who are not able to purchase synthetic pesticides. The roots of the tree can be used for treatments to human ailments such as coughs, chest complaints, toothaches, gout, fevers, constipation, diabetes and microbial infections. It also possesses anti-inflammatory properties that help to reduce arthritic pains. Uses of this tree vary across different countries. A combination of both the methanol extract and the methyl salicylate component from the roots of the plant create a poison that is used for multiple purposes. This poison is used on arrows to hunt with in West Africa. In Limpopo, the VhaVenda people use the roots to prevent mental disorders and they believe that this remedy will also protect children from illnesses during breastfeeding. People in Zimbabwe use the roots to treat people who seem to be possessed by evil spirits and it is often used on snake bites.Ndou, Avhurengwi Phillemon. \\"Securidaca longipedunculata.\\" Securidaca longipedunculata. South African National Biodiversity Institute, Aug. 2006. Web. 20 Nov. 2013 Soap, fishing nets, and baskets can be made with the bark of the tree. This tree is also used to assist some subsistence farmers in maintaining stored grains. The bark and roots of this tree can be grounded up into powder and mixed in with stored grains to create a pesticide against various beetles. This alternative to synthetic pesticides is necessary for small-scale farmers in Africa who may not have the resources or money needed for synthetic pesticides. Practical information =As a pesticide= Its roots can be ground into a fine powder which is used to protect stored grains. Methyl salicylate is a well-known plant stress signal which often has insect repellent properties. Methyl salicylate constitutes up to 90% of the volatile component of its roots, which is very uncommon in other grains or legume seeds.Jayasekara, Thamara K., Philip C. Stevenson, David R. Hall, and Steven R. Belmain. \\"Effect of Volatile Constituents from Securidaca longepedunculata on Insect Pests Of Stored Grain.\\" Journal of Chemical Ecology 31.2 (2005): 303-313. A mixture of methanol extract and methyl salicylate creates a very effective natural pesticide against weevils and other insects in stored grains. Studies done on grains such as corn and cowpea indicated that after 6 days of exposure to S. longipedunculata, the mortality rate of adult beetles was 100% in an enclosed jar. In addition, when S. longipedunculata powder was applied to grains already infested with weevils, the damage done to the grains was reduced by 65%. The beetles that are most likely to infest stored grains are Sitophilus zeamais (maize weevil), Rhyzopertha dominica (lesser grain borer), and Prostephanus truncatus (larger grain borer). Studies suggest that the maize weevil is able to detect the scent of methyl salicylate and tends to avoid it. It is a repellent for insects as well as a poison, which helps to reduce the number of female eggs in the grains. As this type of pesticide use is very efficient, it allows storage of the grains for at least 9 months. This discovery provides some small-scale farmers in Africa with a low cost, natural alternative to synthetic pesticides. In some developing countries, it is difficult for poor farmers to access good quality and affordable synthetic pesticides. In addition these can harm the environment if they are not properly implemented. Such indigenous practices require further validation. =Constraints to wider adoption= The practice of using S. longipedunculata as a common pesticide for stored grains is not a widespread solution. Although it is very efficient to use this species as a tool to store grains for longer periods of time, there are constraints to wider adoption rates. A very significant problem is scarcity in natural resources.Isman, Murray B. \\"Neem and Other Botanical Insecticides: Barriers to Commercialization.\\" Phytoparasitica 25.(4) (1997): 339-344 S. longipedunculata is used for various different purposes, and they often involve the roots of the plant. If the root of the plant is always being cut, it is difficult for the plant to be harvested constantly. There is little incentive to invest in a project like this because there is no assurance that the starting material can be reproduced in sufficient quantities. In addition, studies have shown that a specific concentration of the active ingredient, methyl salicylate, is needed for the powder to effectively work as a pesticide. Improved technologies are needed in order to fully cover all the seeds with the powder in order for the repellent to work. Turning over the crops and mixing it by hand can be very labor-intensive for the farmer and it doesn‚Äôt always assure full coverage of the seeds. One solution could be to create an extract by mixing the powder with water. An extract would be useful for maize seeds because the glassy surface of maize prevents the powder from adhering to its surface. This will allow the pesticide to be evenly spread out, although more tests and studies need to be done to improve this technique.

He was a Portuguese American who came to California as a young man, and settled in Merced County.  Biography  Avila was born March 19, 1865 on S√£o Jorge Island in the Azores of Portugal. He immigrated from the Azores to California in 1883. For the first several years Avila worked as a laborer on local farms in Alameda County (Niles and Mission San Jose areas).\\"California\\" by Robert L. Santos; California State University, Stanislaus, Librarian/Archivist Avila then in 1888 moved to the Atwater-Buhach area in Merced County and planted a successful garden of sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas) from seeding stock of his country. Then he planted a field of 6 or 7 acres of sweet potatoes. Eventually, with his brother Antone, he bought a 20-acre farm field in Merced County for a $1 an acre that was flood land near the Merced River in a California valley. Avila planted sweet potatoes there and became a pioneer sweet potato grower in Merced County. He produced over one hundred sacks of sweet potatoes per acre. As of 1905, Avila was selling his sweet potatoes to buyers in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon, and shipping out up to one hundred and forty-five railroad carloads a year. This species of potato was originally native to Central and South America. It is thought that the sweet potato was originally introduced to Europe by Christopher Columbus. From Avila's original European Azore plantings of his sweet potato crop there grew a major commercial industry in the area of Atwater and Buhach, California. Avila promoted the spread of sweet potato cultivation in the Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley in California. The sweet potatoes that Avila introduced became popular in San Francisco eating establishments, restaurants, and hotels. In 1905, Avila lived on his forty acre ranch, located northwest of the town of Merced. Ten acres were devoted to growing sweet potatoes. The remaining acreage was used for farm produce such as fruit and alfalfa for farm animals. At this same time period he had a general merchandise store in Merced. The sweet potato industry in California during the beginning of the nineteen hundreds was controlled by a group of Portuguese growers called the \\"Big Four\\" of which √Åvila was one. By 1910 sweet potatoes were grown on over 2000 acres in Merced County alone, and on over 5,000 acres throughout California. Sweet potato growing became associated with dairy farming in the area: \\"Typically a family would buy twenty to forty acres, plant sweet potatoes the first season, and later start a dairy herd.\\" Avila was a city leader of Atwater and became a founder of the Atwater branch of the Bank of America. During 1912‚Äì13 √Åvila was the supreme president of the Cult of the Holy Spirit.  Family  Avila was married twice. Merced County records show that Avila had married for the first time on September 7, 1893 to a lady ten years his junior, Miss Imilia Pacheco.John Bettencourt Avila and Imilia Pacheco, 1893 accessed June 30, 2013 He had two daughters by her, Delfina and Belmira. Avila's second wife's name was Miss Pulisena Duarte. She was one year younger and also came from the Azores. By her he had an additional two daughters, Maggie and Mary.

Written some time after the poet was forced to marry the daughter of the Sultan of Langkat instead of his chosen love in Java, this collection consists of 24 titled poems and pieces of lyrical prose, none of which are dated. First published in the magazine Poedjangga Baroe, the collection has been republished as a stand-alone book several times. Analysis of Nyanyi Sunyi has focused on the theme of God and His relationship to humanity, as well as of aspects of human existence: fate, dissatisfaction, and escape. Literary critics H.B. Jassin and Zuber Usman view the collection as an attempt to address Amir‚Äôs worldly problems. The collection has been noted as difficult to read owing to its usage of rarely used Malay and Javanese terms and basis in Islamic culture and Malay history. Despite this, Nyanyi Sunyi has been described as freer in its form than traditional Malay poetry, with what poet Chairil Anwar termed \\"compactly violent, sharp, and yet short\\" sentences which brought a new style to the Indonesian language. Background Amir‚Äôs arranged marriage is thought to have heavily influenced Nyanyi Sunyi. Amir Hamzah (1911‚Äì1946) was a Dutch-educated Malay writer of noble descent and devout Muslim. He was well-oriented in traditional Malay literature, with favourites including historical texts such as Hikayat Hang Tuah, Syair Siti Zubaidah, and Hikayat Panca Tanderan. Amir likewise read works of Arabic, Persian, and Hindu literature. As a result, he had an extensive vocabulary. Poet Laurens Koster Bohang considers the poems included in Nyanyi Sunyi as having been written between 1933 and 1937, while Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw dates the poems to 1936 and 1937. The time was one of great emotional turmoil for Hamzah, who was required to marry the daughter of the Sultan of Langkat, who had funded his studies in Java. At the time Amir had reportedly fallen in love with a Javanese woman while studying, and was forced to leave her. Contents Njanji Sunji consists of twenty-four titled pieces and an untitled quatrain. Indonesian literary documentarian H.B. Jassin classifies eight of the works as lyrical prose, with the remaining thirteen as poems. None of the works in Nyanyi Sunyi (and indeed none of Amir's other works) are dated. At the end of the book is a couplet, reading \\"\\", which American poet and translator Burton Raffel translates as \\"A flower floating in a loose knot of hair / Gave birth to my sorrowful poems\\". The poems within the collection are: Untitled poems #Untitled quatrain (\\"Sunyi Itu Duka\\"; \\"Silence is Sorrow\\") Titled poems #\\"Padamu Jua\\" (\\"For You Too\\") #\\"Barangkali\\" (\\"Perhaps\\") #\\"Hanya Satu\\" (\\"Only One\\") #\\"Permainanmu\\" (\\"Your Games\\") #\\"Tetapi Aku\\" (\\"But I\\") #\\"Karena Kasihmu\\" (\\"Because of Your Love\\") #\\"Sebab Dikau\\" (\\"Because of You\\") #\\"Doa\\" (\\"Prayer\\") #\\"Hanyut Aku\\" (\\"I Float\\") #\\"Taman Dunia\\" (\\"World Park\\") #\\"Terbuka Bunga\\" (\\"Open Flowers\\") #\\"Mengawan\\" (\\"Climb to the Sky\\") #\\"Panji Dihadapanku\\" (\\"Banners in My Sight\\") #\\"Memuji Dikau\\" (\\"Praising You\\") #\\"Kurnia\\" (\\"Gift\\") #\\"Doa Poyangku\\" (\\"Prayer of My Ancestors\\") #\\"Turun Kembali\\" (\\"Descend Again\\") #\\"Batu Belah\\" (\\"Split Stone\\") #\\"Didalam Kelam\\" (\\"In Darkness\\") #\\"Ibuku Dehulu\\" (\\"My Mother, Before\\") #\\"Insyaf\\" (\\"Aware\\") #\\"Subuh\\" (\\"Morning Prayers\\") #\\"Hari Menuai\\" (\\"Harvest Day\\") #\\"Astana Rela\\" (\\"Palace of Resignation\\") Form The poems in Nyanyi Sunyi, unlike much of Amir's earlier work, generally did not follow the traditional pantun and syair format of four lines of four words. Teeuw notes that some, such \\"Batu Belah\\", followed traditional European forms such as the ballad. Others were more free- form, leaning towards prose poetry. Amir's diction depends heavily on old Malay terms which saw little contemporary use. He also borrows heavily from other Indonesian languages, particularly Javanese and Sundanes. The choice of words was influenced by the need for rhythm and metre, as well as symbolism related to particular terms. Ultimately, however, Amir is freer in his language use than traditional poets. Indonesian critic Bakri Siregar writes that the result is \\"a beautiful wordplay\\". Translator John M. Echols writes that the poems are \\"difficult reading even for Indonesians\\", while poet Chairil Anwar described the works as \\"obscure poetry\\" which could not be understood by persons without an understanding of Islam and Malay history. Indonesian literary scholar Muhammad Balfas notes that the work also has many allusions to religious texts, both Islamic and Christian. Anwar opined that Amir, through Nyanyi Sunyi, brought a new style to the Indonesian language, with its \\"compactly violent, sharp, and yet short\\" sentences. In a 1945 article he wrote (translation by Raffel), \\"Before Amir (Hamzah) one could call the old poetry a destructive force; but what a bright light he shone on the new language\\". Themes Religion and God are omnipresent throughout the collection, as evidenced from the first poem, \\"Padamu Jua\\". Amir often uses the word \\"Tuhan\\" (\\"God\\"). However, unlike his earlier poems which used it in a similar manner to \\"Dewa\\" (\\"Deity\\"), in Nyanyi Sunyi the word is used as understood in Abrahamic religions, such as Amir's own Islam; Amir shows influences from Sufism. In some cases, writes Teeuw, Amir treats God almost as a lover, using familiar terms such as \\"engkau\\" (\\"you\\") to address Him. However, Amir recognises that he cannot be one with God. Jassin writes that Amir seems aware of his own smallness before God, acting as a puppet for God's will; Teeuw notes that Amir recognises that he would not exist if God did not. This is not to say that Amir accepts his lower position in relation to God; in several cases, Jassin writes, Amir shows a feeling of dissatisfaction over his own lack of power and protests God's absoluteness. Teeuw likewise notes a sense of dissatisfaction throughout the poems, writing that Amir seems to treat God as an entity that \\"only toys with humans, allowing them to be pushed aside and erased\\". Elsewhere Teeuw writes that Amir questions fate and the need for him to separate from his love. Aside from themes of God and religion, Amir also shows an awareness of his own humanity, recognising his own instincts and drives. Jassin writes that \\"Amir's song is the song of a man's soul\\", showing sadness and joy which do not acknowledge class or creed. Teeuw notes a sense of distrust, a feeling that ‚Äì having once lost his love ‚Äì there is no reason Amir will not lose his next lover. Indonesian critic Zuber Usman, meanwhile, discusses the theme of love lost in relation to religion, writing that the loss of his Javanese lover led Amir closer to God. Jassin writes that Amir uses \\"sunyi\\" (\\"silence\\") as a way to address his worldly problems: regarding time, his own identity, God, and love. According to Jassin, by the end of the compilation physical love has drifted towards a spiritual one, with the answers supplied originating from the supernatural. Ultimately, however, Jassin concludes that Amir's soul has not reached maturity; he considers the collection's last poem, \\"Astana Rela\\", as but a temporary escape. Jassin finds that the theme of religion is likewise meant as an escape from Amir's worldly sorrows, an opinion echoed by Usman. Publication Nyanyi Sunyi was first published in the November 1937 issue of Poedjangga Baroe, a literary magazine which Amir had helped establish. It was later published as a standalone book, and by 1949 it had seen its third printing. In 1941 Amir published another collection of poems, entitled Buah Rindu (\\"Fruits of Longing\\"), which consisted mostly of his earlier works. Jassin notes that the works in Nyanyi Sunyi appear more developed and mature than those in the later collection. Teeuw notes that the later collection was more explicitly about romantic love, rather than the religious love of Nyanyi Sunyi.

Initial stages of the war  √âtricourt, France, during Operation Michael, 24 March 1918 With the expansion of military conscription and reserve systems in the decades leading up to the 20th century, the potential size of armies increased substantially, while the industrialization of firepower (bolt-action rifles with higher rate-of-fire, larger and more artillery, plus machine guns) was starting to multiply the potential amount munitions they required. Military logistical systems, however, continued to rely on 19th century technology. The main method of transportation of supplies at the start of the war was still by horse due to the lack of available alternatives in 1914, similar to that of the inclusion of cavalry within the armed forces, and the fast pace of the war in the first part of the war. When World War I started, the capabilities of rail and horse- drawn supply were stretched to their limits. As the war progressed it became increasingly difficult to supply soldiers in the traditional way by horse and carriage due to conditions at the front. The supply routes became muddy and impassable, improvement to artillery on both sides and other tactics meant that supplies became increasingly delivered under cover of night and were considerably slowed down.  Trench warfare and blockade of Germany  Russian ammunition baskets for heavy artillery shells. Supplying the artillery of WWI was a challenge which, for Britain, resulted in the Shell Crisis of 1915. However, as the war ground down into static trench warfare it became easier for armies to support their troops with the use of the railway, especially for the artillery. This made the transportation of supplies easier and quicker to get from the factories to the front line. This did have problems of their own, as seen by the Shell Crisis of 1915. Where the stalemate of trench warfare took hold, special narrow gauge trench railways were built to extend the rail network to the front lines. The great size of the German Army proved too much for its railways to support except while immobile.Creveld, pp. 138‚Äì141. Tactical successes like Operation Michael devolved into operational failures where logistics failed to keep up with the army's advance over shell-torn ground. On the seas, the British blockade of Germany kept a stranglehold on raw materials, goods, and food needed to support Germany's war efforts, and is considered one of the key elements in the eventual Allied victory in the war. On the Allied Side a huge producer of supplies was the United States of America, meaning the supplies had to be transported over the Atlantic Ocean to England and France. At the same time, Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare showed the vulnerability of shipping lanes despite Allied naval superiority. This revolutionised how war shipping was conducted and saw the first use of military convoys to counter the threat caused by German U-Boats. In June 1918 the Allies organized the Military Board of Allied Supply, which proved to be an invaluable mechanism for coordinating logistical requirements for armies working in close proximity during the final battles that autumn. The Board's report contains overviews of the logistical systems for the principal Allied armies.‚ÄúReport of the Military Board of Allied Supply‚Äù 2 vols. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1914. United States The trans-Atlantic distances and the American inexperience at large scale operations combined to make support of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) extraordinarily difficult. Mass production of munitions, including cargo ships, did not reach full potential until near the end of the war. In the meantime, the United States relied upon European allies for most weapons and upon Britain for shipping. In France, the Americans built or improved ports, railroads, depots, and other facilities to move the supplies to the front. Slowly the Americans learned the multiple functions associated with supporting a large-scale conflict, which allowed the AEF to operate as an independent force. Experience gained in World War I proved invaluable during later conflicts.Leo P. Hirrel, ‚ÄúSupporting the Doughboys: US Army Logistics and Personnel During World War I‚Äù Ft.

Its discontinuities are pictured with white discs outlines with blue circles. In mathematics, an integer-valued function is a function whose values are integers. In other words, it is a function that assigns an integer to each member of its domain. Floor and ceiling functions are examples of an integer-valued function of a real variable, but on real numbers and generally, on (non-disconnected) topological spaces integer-valued functions are not especially useful. Any such function on a connected space either has discontinuities or is constant. On the other hand, on discrete and other totally disconnected spaces integer-valued functions have roughly the same importance as real-valued functions have on non-discrete spaces. Any function with natural, or non-negative integer values is a partial case of integer-valued function.  Examples  Integer-valued functions defined on the domain of all real numbers include the floor and ceiling functions, the Dirichlet function, the sign function and the Heaviside step function (except possibly at 0). Integer-valued functions defined on the domain of non-negative real numbers include the integer square root function and the prime-counting function.  Algebraic properties  On an arbitrary set , integer-valued functions form a ring with pointwise operations of addition and multiplication, and also an algebra over the ring of integers. Since the latter is an ordered ring, the functions form a partially ordered ring: :f \\\\le g \\\\quad\\\\iff\\\\quad \\\\forall x: f(x) \\\\le g(x).  Uses  = Graph theory and algebra = Integer-valued functions are ubiquitous in graph theory.

The site has been occupied since at least the 12th century. The present buildings date from the 17th to 19th centuries, and include the chateau, a theater, a chapel, a pavilion and a unique water nymphaeum. The chateau and chapel were badly damaged during World War I, but have been repaired. They have been protected under various designations since 1945, and since February 1996 have had an overall designation as a historical monument. The park of the chateau with its views over the valley of Mortagne has been a classified natural site since 1999. Owners There are records of Gerb√©viller from 1179, when the Simon II, Duke of Lorraine gave the castle and estate of \\"Gilbert-Viller\\" to his son Frideric or Ferri de Bitche. He in turn passed it to his fourth son Philippe (died 1243). Later it passed to the house of Wisse, who held it for a long time. The estate then passed to the house of Deuilly and Chatelet, by the marriage of Hue du Chatelet with Madeleine Wisse de Gerb√©viller. Pierre du Ch√¢telet, their son, became counselor of state to Antoine, Duke of Lorraine, in 1521. He was the seneschal of the Duke of Lorraine and head of his council in 1530. He was made bailey of Nancy in 1541, and in 1543 represented the duke at the conference of Pont-√†-Mousson concerned with the introduction of Lutheranism in Metz. He took a firm stand, and protected Catholic interests. He died in 1556 and was buried in the church of Saint-Jean-Baptiste in Gerb√©viller. In 1589 Anne du Chatelet inherited the property. She married the count of Tornielle. In 1621 Charles Joseph de Tornielle was made Marquis de Gerb√©viller. The Tornielle family became extinct in 1737 with the death of Anne-Joseph, grand chamberlain of Duke Leopold. He had no children by Antoinette-Louise de Lambertye, and granted his title and estates to Camille de Lambertye. Prince and Duke Armand-Louis-H√©lie d'Arenberg (born 14 April 1904) married Gabreille de Lambertye-Gerbeviller on 9 August 1941. As of 2010 the chateau was owned by the Arenbergs. Ch√¢teau The chateau in ruins in 1915 The town was destroyed by Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy (1433‚Äì1477). It was destroyed again by Louis XIII (1601‚Äì1643), who razed the walls, fortified gates and the castle. The present chateau was built by Camille de Lambertye-Gerb√©viller during the reign of Louis XV (1710‚Äì1774). It was built sometime before 1750 by Germain Boffrand. During World War I it was partially destroyed by bombing on 24 August 1914. The architect Albert Laprade rebuilt the chateau for Charles de Lambertye-Gerb√©viller in 1920. Outbuildings include a theater from the second half of the 19th century. In February 1996 the chateau and outbuildings were designated a historical monument. Chapel The Palatine Chapel, opposite the castle outside the domain, has changed considerably over the centuries. There are records of a chapel in 1050, when the house of Lorraine rebuilt part of the choir. Around 1326 Jen Wisse built a nave and the sepulchral chapel that forms today's choir. It holds the tombs of the lords of Gerb√©viller. It was enlarged in the 15th century, and used as a parish church. The chapel was again enlarged in the 17th century. Christine Claude du Ch√¢telet gave it to the Carmelites in 1618. The chapel and Carmelite convent were sold as national property during the Revolution. The Marquis Ernest de Lambertye (1789-1862) redesigned the chapel almost entirely, thinking of offering it as an asylum for Pope Pius IX, who was in danger of being driven from his Papal States at the time of the unification of the Kingdom of Italy. The chapel suffered from the bombing of 24 August 1914. Between 1920 and 1923 the two towers and the entrance to the sacristry were restored. Park The nymphaeum The park was originally created around 1620 for Charles-Emmanuel de Tornielle, with a red-brick pavilion and a nymphaeum. The red pavilion also dates to 1620 and was built by Cl√©ment M√©tezeau, the architect of the Place des Vosges in Paris. The nymphaeum consists of three rooms embedded in a dip in the ground, reached by a stairway of two flights. It provides a passage between the upper and lower parts of the park. The rooms are richly decorated with mosaics of shells and colored pebbles. Jets of water flow in basins and spring from the ground. It is the only water nymphaeum in France. As of 2012 the Nymphaeum was benefiting from a campaign for full restoration to its original appearance. The landscaped park was redesigned in the English style around 1815 by Louis- Martin Berthault, the architect of the Empress Josephine, for whom he had designed the parks of Malmaison and Compi√®gne. The park is denoted a historic monument and a protected natural site. It covers of alternating meadows and stands of tall trees, and is crossed by the Mortagne River. There is a rose garden, a 19th-century garden divided in \\"rooms\\" separated by walls, and a \\"1900 garden\\" inspired by the √âcole de Nancy.

After winning twice as a two-year-old, Chamossaire contested all three legs of the Triple Crown in 1945. He finished fourth in both the 2000 Guineas and the Derby before winning the St Leger. He was retired to stud where he proved to be a successful sire of winners. Chamossaire died in 1964. Background Chamossaire‚Äôs sire Precipitation was a top class racehorse, best known for winning the Ascot Gold Cup in 1937. He went on to become a successful stallion, siring three other Classic winners in Airborne (Derby), Premonition (St Leger) and Why Hurry (Epsom Oaks), as well as the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Supreme Court. Precipitation himself was sired by the unbeaten champion, Hurry On, making him a representative of the Godolphin Arabian sire line. Chamossaire's dam, Snowberry, was a very fast filly who won the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot. She was a daughter of Myrobella, the leading British two-year-old of 1932, making her a sister of the 2000 Guineas winner Big Game. Snowberry went on to produce Ariana, the grand-dam of The Derby winner Snow Knight. With a combination of stamina from his sire and speed from his dam, Chamossaire was regarded as having an excellent classic pedigree. As a yearling, the colt was sold for 2,700 guineas to Walter Earl, acting on behalf of Stanhope Joel, a member of the influential Joel family. Chamossaire, named after a mountain in Switzerland was sent into training with Richard \\"Dick\\" Perryman at his Beaufort House stable in Newmarket. Restrictions imposed during the Second World War meant that many British racecourses, including Epsom, Doncaster and Ascot were closed and many races were either abandoned or run away from their traditional venues. Racing career =1944: two-year-old season= Racing exclusively at Newmarket Racecourse, Chamossaire won two of his three races. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the season's best two-year-olds, he was given a weight of 126 pounds, seven pounds below the top-rated Dante. =1945: three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Chamossaire finished third behind High Peak and Royal Charger in the Chatteris Stakes in May. He was nevertheless moved up in class to contest the 2000 Guineas, which was run that year over the July Course. In an exceptionally strong renewal of the race he finished fourth of the twenty runners behind Court Martial, Dante and Royal Charger. Chamossaire was closing on the leaders in the final strides, leading to his being strongly fancied for the Derby a month later. In June Chamossaire returned to the July Course for the \\"Derby Stakes\\", a substitute race for the Derby. In a field of twenty-seven runners he again finished fourth, beaten two lengths, a head and a neck by Dante, Midas and Court Martial. He continued to campaign at Newmarket in the summer of 1945, finishing second to Stirling Castle when strongly fancied for the Princess of Wales's Stakes and then recording a narrow victory in the Cavenham Stakes over one and a half miles. Despite the end of the War, Doncaster racecourse was not ready to stage a classic in the autumn of 1945 and the St Leger was run over fourteen furlongs at York Racecourse. Prize-money, however, returned to pre-war levels and with ¬£10,210 to the winner, the race was the most valuable run in Britain that year. Ridden by Tommy Lowrey, Chamossaire started at odds of 11/2 in a field of twelve runners with the Aga Khan's filly Naishapur starting 5/2 favourite. The race attracted a crowd estimated at 150,000 causing serious congestion on the roads leading to the racecourse: many spectators abandoned their cars and walked the final miles to the course. Stirling Castle took the lead after half a mile and led the field into the straight. Chamossaire took the lead a furlong from the finish and held off the late challenge of King George VI's colt Rising Light to win by two lengths, with Stirling Castle in third place. For his two remaining starts, Chamossaire returned to Newmarket and raced in all-aged competition. He finished second to Black Peter in the Jockey Club Stakes over fourteen furlongs and second by a neck to the filly Amber Flash in the two-mile Jockey Club Cup. Chamossaire remained in training as a four-year-old with the Ascot Gold Cup as his main objective, but he never ran again. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Chamoissaire an \\"average\\" winner of the St Leger. Stud record For most of his stud career, Chamossaire was a useful, but inconsistent stallion, based at the Snailwell Stud near Newmarket. His best winners included Le Sage (Sussex Stakes), Chamier (Irish Derby), Cambremer (St Leger, Prix du Cadran) and Your Highness (Irish Derby). In 1961 he sired Santa Claus whose wins included the Irish 2,000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and Irish Derby. The successes of Santa Claus earned Chamossaire the posthumous title of Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1964.

Dividend futures can be on a single company, a basket of companies, or on an Equity index. They settle on the amount of dividend paid by the company, the basket of companies, or the index during the period of the contract. For example, if company A pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 in 2012. If an investor buys a 2012 dividend future, the settlement price of the future will be equal to 4 x $0.25 = $1 per contract. The profit or loss the investor makes depends on the difference between the price they bought or sold the future and the settlement price. For instance, if the investor bought the 2012 dividend future at $0.90, he would make a profit of $0.10 per contract. Most dividend futures trades occur before the dividend is known, hence allowing investors to go \\"long\\" or \\"short\\" the future dividend payment. The \\"buyer\\" of the contract, is said to be \\"long\\", and the \\"seller\\" of the contract, is said to be \\"short\\". The terminology reflects the expectations of the parties: the buyer thinks the dividend is going to increase, while the seller thinks it will decrease. The contract itself costs nothing to enter; the buy/sell terminology is a linguistic convenience reflecting the position each party is taking (long or short). Dividend futures are usually traded in increments/lots/batches of 100 or 1000 and have a 1-year time span. When purchased, no transmission of share rights or dividends occurs. Being futures contracts, they are traded on margin, thus offering leverage, and are not subject to the taxes equity holders must pay when they receive dividend distribution on their stocks. They are traded in various financial markets, mainly in Europe, and Asia, and several Blue chip companies and Equity Indices are available with maturities going as long as 5 years for Equities and 10 years for Equity indices.  History  In 1999 Professor Michael J. Brennan of the University of California at Los Angeles proposed the creation of dividend strips for the S&P; 500\\\\. He argued that these would \\"enhance the ability of markets to aggregate and transmit information\\" and that \\"since the level of the market index must be consistent with the prices of the future dividend flows, the relation between these will serve to reveal the implicit assumptions that the market is making in arriving at its valuation. These assumptions will then be the focus of analysis and debate.\\" Before dividend futures existed, an investor who wanted a similar exposure did so by trading a dividend swap. Dividend swaps are the over-the-counter version of dividend futures. They allow two parties to agree to swap in the future a pre-defined amount of cash against the amount of dividends paid by the underlying stock, basket or equity index. Created in the early 2000s, dividend Swaps became very popular because they allowed equity holders to \\"sell\\" their future dividends in advance and hence hedge their future dividend stream. The biggest players were investment banks looking to cover their future dividend exposure from derivatives positions they had on their books. The first dividend future was listed in June 2008 by the derivatives exchange Eurex, a derivatives exchange, on the Euro Stoxx 50 dividends, and since then many new dividend futures were created on various exchanges. The exchange listing made these products available to wider range of investors who could not trade over-the-counter (OTC). There are currently dividend futures listed on Eurex, NYSE Euronext, MEFF, Borsa Italiana IDEM, London Stock Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, CME Group and the Singapore Exchange.  Uses  Dividend futures can be used by investors for investment, hedging or arbitrage. =Investment= Dividend futures allow investors to take a position on the future dividends paid by single names or indices such as the Euro Stoxx 50. An investor might believe that a company's future dividend payment expectations are too high or too low and can decide to take a position in dividend futures to express his views. By investing in a single stock dividend future, an investor has a proxy of a company's earnings. dividends paid by a company usually varying in line with its earnings, the investor can take a pure fundamental view by choosing which dividend, hence which earnings forecast, he wants to pinpoint. Because dividend future are finite, at one stage, the performance of the future will be driven only by the company's paid dividends rather than micro or macro economic news flow. By investing in an Index dividend future, investors have a similar exposure, except they're taking a view on a basket of companies. This is usually done to implement a macro view on future dividends in a country or a continent. =Hedging= Most equity derivatives instruments, like options, are sensitive to future evolution of dividends. In the past, the dividend future market players were pure derivatives players because they were the most sensitive to dividend outcomes. They use these futures, and before them dividend Swaps, to hedge their dividend exposure. dividend futures are also seen as an inflation hedge. Studies show that dividend and inflation growth are correlated, hence the use of long term dividend futures, like on indices, to hedge an investor's exposure to inflation. =Arbitrage= Like on any asset class, investors can take a relative value position on a market compared to another. In dividend futures, the arbitrage opportunities can be taken against its underlying stock or CDS. Going long a dividend future, for example, and short the underlying stock results in taking a position on a company's dividend yield. Another type of arbitrage, that is common with equities, is called Index Arbitrage. In dividend futures, Index Arbitrage consists of taking spread positions between an Index dividend futures and its components.  Market Players Historical players in this market were banks who offset the dividend risks from their structured products to their clients, mainly hedge funds, through dividend Swaps. Year 2008 saw the arrival of the first dividend futures and the collapse of the financial industry, hence market participants in dividend Swaps switched their position to dividend futures to eliminate counterparty risks. The listing also brought new players, who were not active in the Over- The-Counter market, such as asset managers, pension funds and family offices. The market not being anymore reserved to some few specialists, volumes picked up and number of participants grew.  A new asset class  From a hedging instrument, dividend futures have the potential of developing as an asset class on their own. From an investor perspective, dividend futures give exposure to a specific cash flow stream from a company. Unlike equities, where an investor is exposed to continuing dividend stream, dividend futures allow investors to choose the year they want to get exposed on. From a risk profile perspective, dividends are unique. When a company's profit improve, dividends usually rise; when they fall dividends are cut. However, dividends are somewhat resilient because companies tend to smooth the variations of their dividend payments. For these reasons, research have highlighted that dividends are in between stocks and bonds in terms of risk-reward.

In September 1999, Westheimer testified at National Labor Relations Board hearings on behalf of NYU graduate students. The students were attempting to form a union. Westheimer was the only non-tenured professor to testify. He had applied for tenure, and although both internal and external reviewers approved his request, it was later revoked due to 'insufficient scholarship'. Westheimer felt that his tenureship was revoked because of his defense of the rights of graduate students to unionize: \\"I remember that, shortly after I testified, I got a letter from an associate dean about something saying that he was \\"shocked and disappointed\\" at my behavior.\\" University authorities urged Westheimer to withdraw his bid for tenure \\"for his own good\\" so he would not have to put a failed bid for tenure on his CV. Doing so would have prevented him from taking further legal action, so instead he made the case public. At the start of 2002, the federal government charged the university with illegally firing Westheimer, as his 'extramural utterances' had no bearing on his academic work. After a five-month investigation, the Labor Board concluded that \\"the real reason for [Professor Westheimer's] denial of tenure was because of his union activities.\\"Fogg, Piper (2002, February 28).

As oldest brother, Robert believed he would be the natural successor to his father as the leader of the Durst Organization. When their father Seymour chose Douglas over him in 1992, Robert estranged himself from his entire family and in 2006 sued for his share of the Durst family trust. A $65 million settlement was reached that divested Robert of all future share of the Durst family wealth. In 2001, Robert Durst was charged with murdering a neighbor and dismembering his body in Galveston, Texas. Pleading self-defense, he was acquitted of the murder charge. Douglas was interviewed by The New York Times in January 2015, and was quoted as saying about Robert: \\"There's no doubt in my mind that if he had the opportunity to kill me, he would.\\" Douglas Durst told The New York Times in December 2015 that he believed, until 2001, in his brother's innocence regarding Kathleen McCormack Durst's \\"disappearance\\" in 1982.

Naff documented Arab immigration to the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This first wave of mostly Christian immigrants was the first major emigration from the Middle East to the U.S. Naff donated her collection of artifacts and oral histories from early Arab immigrants to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. Naff had driven throughout the nation to collect oral histories and family heirlooms for the collection. She amassed more than 450 oral histories, 2,000 photographs, and more than 500 artifacts.

In 1926, he was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives from Montgomery County and served as the only Republican member in the chamber for two two-year terms. He was the United States attorney for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas during the Little Rock Crisis of 1957‚Äì1958. He served a year on the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1966 as a temporary appointee of Democratic Governor Orval Faubus. Background Cobb was born near Hatton in Polk County, Arkansas, to the lumberman Philander Cobb (born 1869), who in 1916 was an active supporter of the Republican nominee, Charles Evans Hughes, who narrowly lost the election to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. Cobb's mother was the former Ida Sublette, a songwriter, playwright, poet, and the author of four books.Osro Cobb, Osro Cobb of Arkansas: Memoirs of Historical Significance, Carol Griffee, ed., (Little Rock, Arkansas: Rose Publishing Company, 1989, pp. 3, 6. In his memoirs, Cobb recalls that his mother \\"always made me feel that I was destined to do great things and make a meaningful contribution to my state and country of which she would be proud. She instilled in me the belief that by doing my very best, almost any objective I might seek would be within my grasp. She was right.\\"Cobb, p. 7. Reared mostly in Caddo Gap in Montgomery County, Arkansas, Cobb as a child often accompanied his father to work and hence developed an interest in the family business and later in the law.Cobb, p. 9. College years Because Cobb graduated from high school at the age of sixteen, he enrolled in 1920 at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, formerly known as Arkadelphia Methodist College or as Henderson Brown College. Cobb refers to Henderson as \\"a small Methodist college ideally suited to my needs. It took only a short time for me to establish my identity and to make numerous friends among my fellow students and with faculty members.\\" He lettered in baseball and was a member of the debate team and reports that he was falsely accused of plagiarism by an English professor regarding an article he wrote about moonshiners in Montgomery County.Cobb, pp. 10‚Äì12. At Henderson, Cobb became an advocate of two-party competition as a potential solution to Arkansas' lagging national standing both politically and economically. He graduated from Henderson in 1925 with two bachelor's degrees. Cobb reports having read: > the comparative annual ratings of the various states in education [and] per > capita income ... and noted to my dismay that Arkansas and Mississippi > always seemed to be the last two states. I also observed that most of the > outstanding graduates of our colleges were leaving Arkansas for greater > opportunities; Arkansas was at a standstill. It became my obsession to help > Arkansas throw off its shackles. > The major factors contributing to the state's problems were: > (1) Arkansas manufacturers had to pay three times the rates to ship their > goods east as eastern merchants had to pay to send the same goods west to > Arkansas. > (2) In those days, Arkansas was a rock-ribbed, solid, yellow-dog Democrat > state. ... political machines were spawned in various counties and they > corrupted the elections by any means deemed necessary. .... The Republican > Party had to be convinced that it must really work in Arkansas and across > the South to help establish a viable, competitive two-party system. There > was no chance for Arkansas to move forward until it could become a doubtful > state in presidential elections.Cobb, p. 14. Cobb left Henderson for a year when the family lumber mill at Caddo Gap burned‚Äîa $100,000 loss. In the summer of 1924, he went to Union County in south Arkansas to work in the oil boom in an office at Norphlet near Smackover. He recalls a bizarre murder case there. A barber in Norphlet offered Cobb some cake that the man's wife had mailed to him from Oklahoma. The cake was, however, saturated with poison, and the barber quickly died of eating it. On an errand, Cobb delayed eating the cake and later reflected that he \\"felt the Lord had intervened to take care of me. In fact, I have been spared on several occasions, and I feel there has been a Divine Protector looking after me.\\"Cobb, pp. 16‚Äì17. Cobb applied for a Rhodes scholarship, but the 1925 appointment went to J. William Fulbright, a student at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, who later became the UA president and a long-term U.S. senator.Cobb, p. 13. Cobb organized a Republican club at Henderson, having received encouragement from some faculty members. He became acquainted with Harmon L. Remmel of Little Rock, the Republican national committeeman during much of the 1920s and arranged to have his older friend Remmel deliver the 1925 commencement address at Henderson.Cobb, p. 15. Political career While serving in the Arkansas House, Cobb began studying for an LLB degree at what is now the William H. Bowen School of Law at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. In 1929, Cobb was admitted to practice law before the Arkansas Supreme Court. Several senior partners in the law firm where he was employed, Campbell, Mallory, and Throgmorton in the capital city of Little Rock, were Republicans. Through these contacts, Cobb became the assistant U.S. attorney under Wallace Townsend and alongside Drew Bowers. He also practiced law privately at the same time, a practice then permitted and not considered a conflict-of-interest.Cobb, p. 29. As the only Republican in the Arkansas House, Cobb was invited to meet with U.S. President Calvin Coolidge in what turned out to have been a failed effort to persuade Coolidge to sign into law a bill to create a national park in the Ouachita National Forest. The state, however, already had the health resort, Hot Springs National Park. Cobb met with Coolidge for more than an hour and found him not silent at all but talkative; it turned out that the president had wished that day to delay another appointment and used Cobb to fill in missing time. Coolidge also pocket-vetoed the national park bill, which had the support of Democratic U.S. Senator Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas, his party's 1928 vice-presidential candidate on the Al Smith ticket.Cobb, p. 42. In 1932, Cobb became chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party, a position that he retained for twenty-three years until 1955, when he was succeeded by Ben C. Henley of Harrison, Arkansas. In 1936, Cobb waged an active campaign for governor of Arkansas as a Republican against Democrat Carl Edward Bailey. Cobb stressed that he had been born in Arkansas, whereas the Missouri-born Bailey was a \\"northern man\\", a tactic which went nowhere. Bailey received 156,852 votes (85.4 percent) to Cobb's 26,875 ballots (14.6 percent). Cobb recalled that after the election: > many persons called and visited and complained that they thought a > substantial number of votes for me had not been counted. This probably did > happen, though to what extent no one can be sure. It also hurt the > presidential campaign of my friend, Governor Alf M. Landon of Kansas. This > reinforced my conviction that it was absolutely necessary for the rights of > the minority party to be protected in elections through the appointment of > precinct judges and clerks.Cobb, p. 62. In the late 1930s, Cobb formed the Cobb, Cazort, and Holt law firm in Little Rock, which was dissolved at the start of World War II. In 1942, Cobb joined the United States Army Air Corps, the forerunner of the Air Force at the rank of first lieutenant. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel and was a judge advocate at Berry Field in Nashville, Tennessee, and thereafter at Rosecrans Field in St. Joseph, Missouri. At Wright-Patterson Field in Dayton, Ohio, he worked on contracts to procure aircraft parts for the Army Air Corps. In 1946, he was discharged from the military and joined John E. Coates in the opening of a law firm in the Pyramid Life Building in Little Rock. Cobb represented timber companies and worked to organize the interest group, the Arkansas Wood Products Association, forerunner of the Arkansas Forestry Association. He also became involved in the Smackover oil field in Union County. In 1948, with the assistance of Sid McMath, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Cobb helped to pass Initiated Act 3, which guarantees that a member of the minority party be in place at each precinct in Arkansas. The act prevented Democrats from ignoring votes cast by Republicans in heavily Democrat precincts. US attorney In 1952, Cobb was challenged for the chairmanship at the state convention by Vern Tindall of Stuttgart but again prevailed.Cobb, p. 106. As a delegate to the 1952 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Cobb and the Arkansas delegation voted for U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio but quickly joined with the majority to endorse Dwight D. Eisenhower. Invited to meet with Eisenhower after the nomination, Cobb advised him not to concede a single southern state to the Democratic nominee, later Governor Adlai Stevenson II of Illinois. Cobb writes in his memoirs that Eisenhower \\"did not need to be sold on campaigning in the South because he already was convinced that it would be successful.\\"Cobb, p. 122. In 1954, Eisenhower appointed Cobb as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, a highly visible position during the desegregation of Central High School. In the fall of 1957, Cobb was in communication with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Department of Justice, and the White House regarding late developments. With United States Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr., Cobb represented in federal court the US government's case against Governor Faubus, who attempted without success to thwart desegregation. Cobb reached the conclusion that Faubus had exaggerated the likelihood that segregationists would engage in violence in a vain bid to block desegregation. In his memoirs, Cobb describes his relationship with Herbert Brownell: > ...Brownell had stuck by his guns for the hard line on the integration > dispute. His advice had been followed. The government was committed with no > easy way to extricate itself. Many people on both sides of the controversy > were becoming increasingly unhappy. I am inclined to believe that while Mr. > Brownell was genuinely pleased with the policy, he was grievously > disappointed that it had not achieved better results. The impass with > Governor Orval Faubus may have contributed substantially to [Brownell's] > decision to retire....Cobb, p. 251. Cobb, Faubus, and Rockefeller Late in 1965, Faubus asked Cobb to fill a vacancy on the Arkansas Supreme Court after Justice Sam Robinson retired. On January 11, 1966, Cobb took the position and served for the remainder of the year. Politically, Cobb's Republican activities paralleled the career of Wallace Townsend, an Iowa native who served as Arkansas's Republican national committeeman from 1928 to 1961. In 1964, Cobb refused to support Republican Winthrop Rockefeller for governor and instead endorsed Faubus who won his sixth and final two-year term. At the time, Cobb said that Rockefeller, a businessman originally from New York, had ignored the traditional GOP base in Arkansas. In his memoirs, Cobb reported, \\"\\"A stranger passing through Arkansas at this time and seeing Mr. Rockefeller's advertising on billboards would not know whether Mr. Rockefeller belonged to any political party. Certainly the fact that he is the Republican nominee has not been included. The evidence simply is unanswerable that Mr. Rockefeller is working for his own personal interest to the exclusion of all other considerations, which leaves the Republican Party in Arkansas hanging precariously at the whims of one individual.\\"Cobb, pp. 141‚Äì143. However, in 1966, Cobb endorsed Rockefeller as Faubus' successor. Rockefeller defeated the Democrat James D. Johnson of Conway, a former member of the Arkansas State Senate and the Arkansas Supreme Court who had been aligned with the segregationists in the Little Rock Crisis. Cobb writes of the changed scenario in his memoirs, \\"Arkansas Republicans were eager to work with Winthrop Rockefeller on another race for governor if he could be led to run as a true Republican to help build the party in the state. I liked him personally. He showed me many courtesies, and I still thought [despite feelings in 1964] that he would make a good governor and could be elected on the Republican ticket.... He had learned a lesson. And he won his next two races for governor.... His service contributed greatly to the enormous benefits of two-party government in Arkansas.\\"Cobb, pp. 143‚Äì144. Personal life From the late 1960s until his retirement, Cobb focused on his petroleum and timber interests. In 1938, Cobb married the oil heiress Audrey Umsted, whom he had met while golfing. Her father, Sydney Albert Umsted, had in 1924 drilled the Discovery oil well in the Smackover field but was subsequently fatally injured in a train accident in Mississippi and had died in a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.Cobb, pp. 77‚Äì78. The Cobbs adopted one son, John Cobb. Audrey Cobb died in 1976; the next year he married his neighbor, Martha Jane Rebsamen, the widow of Raymond Rebsamen, a prominent Little Rock industrialist and philanthropist.Cobb, p. 157. Shortly before the second marriage, two armed robbers wearing masks broke into Martha Jane's home and locked her, Cobb, and her housekeeper in a closet. The intruders left with Cobb's Cadillac but called police to tell them of the three people trapped in the closet.Cobb, p. 159. In 1989 and 1990, with assistance from the journalist-editor Carol M. Griffee (1937-2011),Carol Griffee is interred at Forest Park Cemetery in Fort Smith, Arkansas. then of Little Rock, Cobb published two editions of his autobiography entitled Osro Cobb of Arkansas: Memoirs of Historical Significance. Cobb died in Little Rock at the age of ninety-one. His papers are located in Special Collections of the Torreyson Library at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway.

He held office simultaneously as Lord Chancellor of Ireland and English ambassador to Portugal. In the latter role he and his son Paul negotiated the Methuen Treaty, the achievement for which John is chiefly remembered.Ball 1926, p. 14. Early life and career He was born in Bradford-on-Avon in Wiltshire, the eldest son of Paul Methuen (died 1667),Barker & Doyle 2009, p. 310. who was said to be the richest cloth merchant in England, and his wife Grace Ashe, daughter of John Ashe, whose lucrative cloth business was inherited by his son-in-law. The family, whose name was also spelt Methwin or Methwyn, was of Scottish origin: Paul broke with family tradition by not entering holy orders. On his death John inherited the estate which his father had bought at Bishops Cannings, near Devizes. His father's large fortune was divided between John, his six siblings and their mother; his brother William took over the family business. He attended St. Edmund Hall, Oxford but apparently did not take a degree. He entered the Inner Temple and was called to the Bar in 1674. He married Mary Cheevers (or Chivers), of Quemerford, Wiltshire, daughter of Seacole Chivers and Eleanor Roberts. Her father, like his, was a rich clothier. They had five children, including the diplomat Sir Paul Methuen, of whom three survived into adulthood. The marriage was unhappy, probably due to John's notorious infidelity, and ended in separation; as a result he was required to pay Mary substantial alimony. In 1685 he became Master in Chancery, a post he held for the rest of his life, despite numerous complaints about his inefficiency. He was elected to the House of Commons of England as member for Devizes in 1690 and served that constituency, with one short break, until his death. Envoy to Portugal He was appointed the English envoy to Portugal in 1691, to his delight, as he looked forward to a \\"not too onerous position in an agreeable climate\\". No doubt also the salary was welcome, as he was paying substantial alimony to his estranged wife.Heyton et al, ed History of Parliament The precise reason for his selection is unclear, but it may have been due to his family's prominence in the business world, as the English Crown anticipated that the two countries in due course would negotiate a commercial treaty. Tragedy struck the family in 1694 when John's younger son Henry was killed in a brawl with an English merchant in Lisbon. John established good relations with King Pedro II which were to be of value later in negotiating the Methuen Treaty, but was required to return to England on his appointment to the Board of Trade, while his son Paul remained in Lisbon to act as deputy envoy. John had two powerful friends at Court in James Vernon, the Under-Secretary of State, and Vernon's great patron Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland, who, though he was not then a Minister, was probably King William's closest political adviser. On the death of Sir Charles Porter they recommended Methuen as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Although Lord Somers, the English Lord Chancellor, evidently thought little of Methuen, saying that he knew of \\"nothing that qualified him for such an office\\", Sunderland at that time effectively controlled Court patronage, and Methuen was duly appointed. Methuen's crucial support for the Government during the attainder of Sir John Fenwick- in particular his eloquent speech refuting the argument that two Crown witnesses were necessary to support a Bill of Attainder, as was the case in a trial for treason- was another reason for giving him preferment. Lord Chancellor of Ireland Methuen's political experience in England and Portugal could not have adequately prepared him for the bitter and faction-ridden world of Irish politics. The Irish Parliament during his tenure as Lord Chancellor dealt with issues of security, trade, whether to honour (even in part) the articles of the Treaty of Limerick, and the Penal Laws, all of which were the subject of intense controversy and heated debate. Methuen, as Speaker of the Irish House of Lords, was heavily involved in these debates, and claimed that on the debates on the Limerick Treaty articles alone he had attended the House 22 times. He was however generally regarded as being singularly unsuccessful in managing Parliament. He clashed with the powerful William King, Bishop of Derry, and was severely criticised in England for his handling of the debates. He was required to spend more and more time in England, leading to complaints that he was an absentee Chancellor; Elrington Ball in his history of the Irish judiciary remarked that though he held office he could hardly be said to occupy it. Methuen complained that his reputation had been ruined and contemplated resignation, due to his belief that King William III had lost confidence in him. He quarrelled with the hot-tempered Thomas Fitzmaurice, 1st Earl of Kerry, who challenged him to a duel. The matter became public when Richard Ingoldsby, later one of the Lord Justices of Ireland, who carried the challenge, was arrested, but the King quickly ordered Ingoldsby's release.Chichester, Henry Manners \\"Richard Ingoldsby (died 1712)\\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885-1900 Vol. 29 p.11 The Irish born writer John Dunton, visiting Dublin in 1698, left a valuable sketch of the Irish Courts. He described most of the Irish judges as being men of such high reputation that \\"no one complains of them\\";Ball 1926 p.16 but made a significant exception for Methuen, who he remarked seems to be out of vogue.Ball 1926, p. 16. Return to Portugal He returned to Portugal as the English envoy and then as full Ambassador, holding this office with some intervals from 1702 until his death. Until 1703 he was permitted to retain the Irish Chancellorship, although he never sat as a judge again, but in that year the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde, insisted on his dismissal, saying bluntly that \\"he would not have him\\".Ball 1926, p. 22. In 1703 he received the title Ambassador Extraordinary, but not without some difficulty. Initially Lord Nottingham, the Secretary of State, refused it to him, causing him to complain to the royal confidante Sarah Churchill, who in turn complained to Queen Anne. The Queen, whose long friendship with Sarah was rapidly wearing thin, partly due to Sarah's notoriously bad temper, replied wearily that \\"I always took it for granted that Mr. Methuen was to have the title Ambassador Extraordinary\\".Gregg p.175 =Methuen Treaty= In 1702 Methuen persuaded the Portuguese Government to break their alliance with Louis XIV, and then began lengthy negotiations for an offensive and defensive alliance. Paul in his father's absence ultimately concluded the Treaty on 16 May 1703, a step of great significance in the War of the Spanish Succession. John, on his return from England, concluded a commercial treaty on 27 December 1703, opening Portugal to the English cloth trade in return for preferential rates of duty on the import of wine. How beneficial the Treaty was to either side in the long run has been debated; possibly its most important result was the development of the port wine trade, and it was popularly known as \\"the Port-Wine Treaty\\". Frey, Linda and Frey, Martha The Treaties of the War of the Spanish Succession: an Historical and Critical Dictionary Greenwood Press 1995 p.290 =Last years= Methuen in later life increasingly suffered from gout and rheumatism; his health failed and he died, while still in office, on 2 July 1706. His body was embalmed and he was buried in Westminster Abbey. His son Paul and his daughter Isabella (died 1711) are buried close by. Paul never married and as his brother Henry had predeceased him, his estates passed on his death to a cousin. Isabella, who died at 29, was also unmarried. Reputation Despite his undoubted skills as a diplomat, Methuen was a controversial figure, who made many enemies, including Jonathan Swift who dismissed him as \\"a profligate rogue without religion or morals, cunning enough but without abilities of any kind\\".Barker & Doyle 2009, p. 311. His much publicized affair with Sarah Earle, the wife of a diplomatic colleague, damaged his professional standing. Sarah appears to have been living with him at the time of his death, and he remebered her in his last will and testament. His speech on Fenwick's attainder shows him to have been a gifted lawyer, but as a judge he was not highly regarded in Ireland, although his admirers maintained that he mase several necessary reforms to the legal system. Inevitably his reputation suffered from the commparison with his predecessor, the brilliant and popular Sir Charles Porter. Even among his Whig colleagues, opinion on his abilities varied: James Vernon thought highly of him, but Lord Somers clearly did not, and his friendship with Sunderland did his reputation no good in the eyes of those (who were probably a majority of the political class) who regarded Sunderland himself as \\"the subtlest villain on the face of the earth\\".Kenyon p.329 Notes References *Ball, Francis Elrington (1926).

Biography Sakurai was born in Fukuoka as the eldest son of a former samurai retainer of Fukuoka Domain who had become an elementary school principal. He attended military preparatory schools in Kumamoto and Tokyo, and graduated from the 30th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in May 1918. He served as a junior officer with the IJA 36th Infantry Regiment, and graduated from the 37th class of the Army Staff College in November 1925. He had an active early career, serving as an instructor at the Army Toyama School, as a military advisor to the National Revolutionary Army in Beijing, on the staff of the IJA 10th Division, on the staff of the IJA 8th Combined Brigade, battalion commander on the IJA 24th Infantry Regiment, instructor at the Army Infantry School, and on the staff of the China Expeditionary Army and the staff of then the IJA 1st Army. In July 1938, with the opening of the Army's Nakano School, the Army's primary training center for military intelligence operations and unconventional warfare, Sakurai was picked as an instructor. By this time, he already had a reputation of eccentric manners and ruthless, unscrupulous behavior He was promoted to colonel in August 1939 and during the Second Sino-Japanese War, was a member of the Japanese negotiating team on the Hebei‚ÄìChahar Political Council assigned to the headquarters of the China Expeditionary Army. Sakurai was subsequently appointed chief of staff of the IJA 34th Division, which was at the Battle of Zaoyang‚ÄìYichang in 1940. In 1941, he served as an instructor at the Military Police School, and in 1942 was appointed commander of the IJA 65th Infantry Regiment based in Hubei. In August 1943, he was promoted to major general. Subsequently, as commander of the Infantry Group of the IJA 55th Division, Sakurai was assigned to the Japanese Burma Area Army and served as military advisor to the Burma National Army. He was the main Japanese commander at the Battle of the Admin Box in February 1944. After his return to Japan in April 1945, he was appointed commander of the IJA 212th Division, one of the new divisions raised to contest Operation Coronet, the projected American invasion of Japan, and was based near his native Fukuoka at the time of the surrender of Japan. In December 1961, Sakurai was arrested for illegal possession of firearms and swords, and on suspicion of assisting an ultra rightist organization in weapons training and planning a coup. However, he was released due to insufficient evidence. In June 1966, Sakurai took the tonsure, becoming a Buddhist priest, and lived at the temple of Ruriko-ji in Yamaguchi until his death in 1980.

It was created in July 1914, by Brother D√©odat. He planned to create a miniature version of the grotto and basilica at Lourdes, the Rosary Basilica. Some articles in the Daily Mail said that it \\"is the smallest functioning chapel in Europe, if not the world\\". The chapel is non- denominational.  History  The chapel was originally built by Brother D√©odat in March 1914 (measuring 9 feet long by 4.5 feet wide). After taking criticism from other brothers, D√©odat demolished the chapel. He finished a second chapel in July 1914 (measuring 9 feet by 6 feet). However, when the Bishop of Portsmouth visited in 1923, he could not fit through the door, so D√©odat again demolished it. The third and current version of the chapel started soon after the last demolition, and measures 16 feet by 9 feet. D√©odat went to France in 1939 and died there, never having seen his chapel finished. In 1977, a committee was established to restore the chapel, and today it falls under the care of Blanchelande College. In 2010, five stained glass windows were smashed, causing ¬£3,000 worth of damage and leading to condemnation of the vandals. The windows had been smashed previously, notably three times in 2003. The chapel has been described as \\"probably the biggest tourist attraction in Guernsey\\", and \\"intricate\\". In late 2013, there was major work on the overgrowth which was, in places, hiding parts of the chapel. In November 2015 it was closed to allow some major structural work to be undertaken. The works include underpinning the building, stabilising the foundations and weatherproofing the building, and are estimated to cost ¬£500,000. Fundraising is being undertaken. Fully open again to the public in April 2017, the major works such as stabilising the foundations are complete however additional fundraising is needed to finish the final phase of renovation.  Decoration  Surfaces of the chapel are covered with broken china The Little Chapel is decorated with seashells, pebbles, and broken china. \\"From a distance the colours and design make a pleasing whole, close-up it's amazing to see all the different pieces used to create the effect.\\" It has room for around eight people. The chapel was brought sudden fame following a Daily Mirror article, which led to islanders donating coloured china; the Lieutenant-Governor of the island offered mother of pearl, and other gifts came from around the globe. The mosaic style is \\"pique-assiette\\" or \\"Picassiette\\" (a French term based on a pun blending pique-assiette ‚Äì literally, plate-pincher, the sort of person crashing into a party to enjoy a free meal ‚Äì and famous artist Pablo Picasso). According to Mosaic Art Source, \\"[P]ieces of broken pottery, china, glass, buttons, figurines, and/[or] jewelry are cemented onto a base to create a new surface. Almost any form can be used as a base, and any combination of pieces can be applied, restricted only by the individual creator's imagination.\\" The style was the nickname of a French Art Brut artist, Raymond Isidore, who decorated his house near Chartres, known as Maison Picassiette, much in the same style as the Little Chapel.

La Resistenza a Roma He graduated from the University of Rome \\"La Sapienza\\" in Physics with a thesis about projects of construction of an isotope separator based on thermophoresis. His professional scientific career started when he was 25 (8 May 1948), when he published the article \\"Emission of Li8 in the Explosive Disintegration of Nuclei\\" with R.M. Payne in the science journal Nature.C. Franzinetti and R.M. Payne. Emission of Li8 in the Explosive Disintegration of Nuclei, Nature 161. 8 May 1948 Cosmic radiation research In 1947 he joined the University of Bristol as a Research Assistant at the H.H. Wills Physical Laboratory, under the guidance of Nobel Laureate Prof. C. F. Powell. Powell's team's research looked at the sub- nuclear structure of matter through the study of cosmic rays with nuclear emulsion. In 1950 he returned to Rome but he continued his study of cosmic rays. One of the ideas that came out of Powell's team was an expedition in the Mediterranean region to study cosmic radiation at high atmosphere (25 to 30 km) using aerostatic balloons carrying photographic emulsion. Carlo followed the expedition, which took place during the summers of 1952 and 1953 in Naples and in Cagliari, with researchers and students from 13 different physics institutes from various countries. Thirteen balloons were launched, 3 of which were test balloons. Of the other ten, 7 were recovered and 40% of the emulsions had been exposed to cosmic radiation.European Council for Nuclear Research Report on the Expedition to the Central Mediterranean for the Study of Cosmic Radiation.

The first report for the request of a common European Heavy Liquid Chamber at CERN was submitted by Andr√© Lagarrigue but, needing the support of Italian and possibly British physicists, he contacted Franzinetti. Franzinetti led the Italian group concerned with the proposal and construction of the Heavy Liquid Chamber, Gargamelle. At CERN he studied, at different energies, with neutrino and antineutrino beams, on different kinds of targets, the production of pions and strange particles, elastic and quasi-elastic interactions, and, through analysis of the interactions of Neutrinos, he studied the form factors of nucleons. Biophysics His interest in biophysics started during his time in Pisa. During his time in Turin he led a biophysics team of students from the Universities of Turin and Pisa, which conducted studies on visual perception.

One of the most popular artists in Sri Lanka, before the era of reality shows, he is regarded as a symbolic icon in modern Sri Lankan music industry. The health issues in 2014 made him to slow his singing career. Udugama recovered well from a successful liver transplant in mid-2015. Early life and career Udugama's father is a businessman and his mother is a housewife. He has two brothers and two sisters. He is the youngest in the family. Namal was educated at Thalathuoya Central college in Kandy. At school, he played guitar and performed at school events, before joining a band in Kandy. Udugama moved to Colombo, where he began to release albums. He composed and performed the song \\"Samuganne Na Wenwanne Na\\"; the song established his career in the Sri Lankan music industry. Udugama is married to actress Ruwanthi Mangala, and they have one daughter, Dehemi and one son, Nomitha. In February 2015, Udugama became severely ill due to a liver failure condition and admitted to the intensive care unit of a leading private hospital in Colombo. His wife announced that he needs A-negative blood type for the immediate cure. He underwent four life saving operations in Sri Lanka, but needed partial or total liver transplant as the final treatment. Sri Lankan Singers Association started to raise funds for the transplant with many country wide musical shows and some fans also donated money to Namal. After few days, there was a misleading news that he was dead. He was thereafter treated in Global City Hospital in India for the liver transplant . The required liver lobe was given by a cousin of his wife and the surgery was done by Dr Gomathy Narasimhan, who is a Senior Consultant HPB & Liver Transplant Surgery at Global Health City, Chennai. He returned to Sri Lanka with a successful transplant on June 5, 2015. Before the surgery he released Sanda Aithiya song and after recovery, he released a solo hit Thamath Oya in 2015, which gathered crowd back towards him.

Ion suppression is not strictly a problem unless interfering compounds elute at the same time as the analyte of interest. In cases where ion suppressing species do co-elute with an analyte, the effects on the important analytical parameters including precision, accuracy and limit of detection (analytical sensitivity) can be extensive, severely limiting the validity of an assay's results. History At its inception as a tool of analytical chemistry, LC-MS/MS spread rapidly and indeed continues to do so in (amongst others) bioanalytical fields, owing to its selectivity for analytes of interest. Indeed, in many cases this selectivity can lead to a misconception that it is always possible to simplify or (on occasion) almost completely remove the necessity for extensive sample preparation. Consequently, LC-MS/MS has become the analytical tool of choice for bioanalysis owing to its impressive sensitivity and selectivity over other, more conventional chromatographic approaches. However, during and after uptake by bioanalytical laboratories worldwide, it became apparent that there were inherent problems with detection of relatively small analyte concentrations in the complex sample matrices associated with biological fluids (e.g. blood and urine). Proposed mechanisms of ion suppression Put simply, ion suppression describes the adverse effect on detector response due to reduced ionisation efficiency for analyte(s) of interest, resulting from the presence of species in the sample matrix which compete for ionisation, or inhibit efficient ionisation in other ways. Use of MS/MS as a means of detection may give the impression that there are no interfering species present, since no chromatographic impurities are detected. However, species which are not isobaric may still have an adverse effect on the sensitivity, accuracy and precision of the assay owing to suppression of the ionisation of the analyte of interest. Although the precise chemical and physical factors involved in ion suppression are not fully understood, it has been proposed that basicity, high concentration, mass and more intuitively, co-elution with the analyte of interest are factors which should not be ignored. The most common atmospheric pressure ionisation techniques used in LC-MS/MS are electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). APCI is less prone to pronounced ion suppression than ESI, an inherent property of the respective ionisation mechanisms. In APCI, the sole source of ion suppression can be attributed to the change of colligative properties in the solute during evaporization (King et al, J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom 2000, 11, 942-950). ESI has a more complex ionisation mechanism, relying heavily on droplet charge excess and as such there are many more factors to consider when exploring the cause of ion suppression. It has been widely observed that for many analytes, at high concentrations, ESI exhibits a loss of detector response linearity, perhaps due to reduced charge excess caused by analyte saturation at the droplet surface, inhibiting subsequent ejection of gas phase ions from further inside the droplet. Thus competition for space and/or charge may be considered as a source of ion suppression in ESI. Both physical and chemical properties of analytes (e.g. basicity and surface activity) determine their inherent ionisation efficiency. Biological sample matrices naturally tend to contain many endogenous species with high basicity and surface activity, hence the total concentration of these species in the sample will quickly reach levels at which ion suppression should be expected. Another explanation of ion suppression in ESI considers the physical properties of the droplet itself rather than the species present. High concentrations of interfering components give rise to an increased surface tension and viscosity, giving a reduction in desolvation (solvent evaporation), which is known to have a marked effect of ionisation efficiency. The third proposed theory for ion suppression in ESI relates to the presence of non-volatile species which can either cause co-precipitation of analyte in the droplet (thus preventing ionisation) or prevent the contraction of droplet size to the critical radius required for the ion evaporation and/or charge residue mechanisms to form gas phase ions efficiently. It is worthwhile to consider that the degree of ion suppression may be dependent on the concentration of the analyte being monitored. A higher analyte/matrix ratio can give a reduced effect of ion suppression. Assessment of ion suppression during method validation Since it is accepted that ion suppression has the potential to affect the other analytical parameters of any assay, a prudent approach to any LC-MS method development should include an evaluation of ion-suppression. There are two accepted protocols by which this may be achieved, described as follows. = Monitoring of detector response under constant infusion = The more comprehensive approach to assessment of ion suppression is to constantly infuse an appropriate concentration into the mobile phase flow, downstream from the analytical column, using a syringe pump and a 'tee union'. A typical sample should then be injected through the HPLC inlet as per the usual analytical parameters. Monitoring of detector response during this experiment should yield a constant signal appropriate to the concentration of infused species. Once the sample has been injected, a drop in signal intensity (or a negative response) should be observed any time a species is ionised in the ion source. This should allow the retention time of any such species under the analytical parameters of the assay to be determined. Any species causing a negative response may be considered to be contributing to ion suppression, but only if such species co-elute with the analyte of interest. It is also important to consider that species contributing to ion suppression may be retained by the column to a much greater extent than the analyte of interest. To this end, the detector response should be monitored for several times the usual chromatographic run time to ensure that ion suppression will not affect subsequent injections. = Preparation of spiked plasma samples = Another approach to evaluation of ion suppression is to make a comparison between: * Detector response of calibration standard (either aqueous or in another suitable solvent) - This gives the best case scenario for detector response, i.e. under conditions of zero ion suppression * Pre-prepared sample matrix spiked with an identical concentration of analyte - This demonstrates the effect of ion suppression * Detector response of sample matrix spiked with an identical concentration of analyte and subjected to the usual sample preparation procedure - This can demonstrate the difference between any signal loss due to under-recovery during the sample preparation process and true ion suppression Approaches to negating ion suppression There are several strategies for removal and/or negation of ion suppression. These approaches may require in-depth understanding of the ionisation mechanisms involved in different ionisation sources or may be completely independent of the physical factors involved. = Chromatographic separation = If the chromatographic separation can be modified to prevent coelution of suppressing species then other approaches need not be considered. The effect of chromatographic modification may be evaluated using the detector response monitoring under constant infusion approach described previously. = Sample preparation = An effective sample preparation protocol, usually involving either liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) or solid phase extraction (SPE) and frequently derivatisation can remove ion suppressing species from the sample matrix prior to analysis. These common approaches may also remove other interferences, such as isobaric species. Protein precipitation is another method that can be employed for small molecule analysis. Removal of all protein species from the sample matrix may be effective in some cases, although for many analytes, ion suppressing species are not of protein origin and so this technique is often used in conjunction with extraction and derivatisation. = Sample concentration and mobile phase flow rate = Dilution of sample or reducing the volume of sample injected may give a reduction of ion suppression by reducing the quantity of interfering species present, although the quantity of analyte of interest will also be reduced, making this an undesirable approach for trace analysis. Similar is the effect of reducing the mobile phase flow rate to the nanolitre- per-minute range since, in addition to resulting in improved desolvation, the smaller droplets formed are more tolerant to the presence of non-volatile species in the sample matrix. = Calibration techniques to compensate for ion suppression = It is not always possible to eliminate ion suppression by sample preparation and/or chromatographic resolution. In such cases it may be possible to compensate for the effects of ion suppression on accuracy and precision (although not for analytical sensitivity) by adopting complex calibration strategies.  Matrix matched calibration standards  Using matrix matched calibration standards can compensate for ion suppression. Using this technique, calibration standards are prepared in identical sample matrix to that used for analysis (e.g. plasma) by spiking a normal sample with known concentrations of analyte. This is not always possible for biological samples, since the analyte of interest is often endogenously present in a clinically significant, albeit normal, quantity. For matrix matched calibration standards to be effective in compensating for ion suppression, the sample matrix must be free of the analyte of interest. Additionally, it is important that there is little variation in test sample composition since both the test sample and the prepared calibration sample must be affected in the same way by ion suppression. Again, in complex biological samples from different individuals, or even the same individual at a different time, there may be large fluctuations in the concentrations of ion suppressing species.  Standard addition  The standard addition approach involves spiking the same sample extract with several known concentrations of analyte. This technique is more robust and effective than using matrix matched standards but is labor- intensive since each sample must be prepared several times to achieve a reliable calibration.  Internal standard  In this approach, the sample is spiked with a species (internal standard) which is used to normalise the response of analyte, compensating for variables at any stage of the sample preparation and analysis, including ion suppression. It is important that the internal standard displays very similar (ideally identical) properties, with respect to detector response (i.e. ionisation), as the analyte of interest. To simplify the selection of internal standard, most laboratories use an analogous stable isotope in an isotope dilution type analysis. The stable isotope is almost guaranteed to be chemically and physically as close as possible to the analyte of interest, hence producing an almost identical detector response in addition to behaving identically during sample preparation and chromatographic resolution. To this end, the ion suppression experienced by both the analyte and the internal standard should be identical. It is important to note that an excessively high concentration of stable isotope internal standard may cause ion suppression itself, since it will co- elute with the analyte of interest. Hence, the internal standard should be added at an appropriate concentration. = Choice of ionization source = APCI generally suffers less ion suppression than ESI, as discussed previously. Where possible, if ion suppression is unavoidable it may be advisable to switch from ESI to APCI. If this is not possible, it may be useful to switch the ESI ionisation mode from positive to negative. Since fewer compounds are ionisable in negative ionisation mode, it is entirely possible that the ion suppressing species may be removed from the analysis. However, it should also be considered that the analyte of interest may not be ionised effectively in negative mode either, rendering this approach useless.

Kapambwe (born 3 September 1996), better known by his stage name Moonga K., is a singer-songwriter from Botswana.  Early life  Moonga was born in Kitwe, Zambia, with a twin sister, to a reggae singing father and gospel singing mother. He and his family moved to Gaborone, Botswana in mid-2000. He grew up around music ranging from reggae, gospel, hip-hop, jazz, R&B; and rock. He found an adoration for R&B;/Soul music from artists such as Beyonc√©, Andr√© 3000, Usher and Robin Thicke. K. started singing at the age of six, singing with his dad and his band as they would rehearse in their garage. In 2006, at the age of 9, he entered his primary school's first talent show and made his debut performance singing Destiny's Child's \\"Stand Up For Love.\\" Soon after, he began performing frequently at his school's events and learning more vocal techniques from his favorite artists. = 2008: Drakensberg Boys' Choir School = In 2008, his music teacher got him to audition for the Drakensberg Boys' Choir School and at the event he met his biggest supporting person, Rosalyn Beukes. \\"We were at Bothlale Primary School's Annual Talent Show, when during the interval, the school choir sang for us\\", said Rusette Auton, one of the organizers of MAD (My African Dream). \\"Out of the Choir we could hear this amazing voice ... We called the voice out, and identified it as belonging to a young man aged 12 years old. We insisted he enter My African Dream\\". 2009: My African Dream: Talent Search He made it through the Semi Finals and then proceeded to be selected as the Judges' Choice in the Grand Finale. As he stood on stage in the finals, conquering the stage fright that made him nauseous and shake in the wings, \\"I was so worried he was going to freeze on stage\\" Rusette said. \\"But he got half way through his song and every single one of the 650 people in the auditorium gave him a standing ovation. He sang with a passion that I had never seen .. It was quite phenomenal! Many of the audience (including myself) were moved to tears\\".‚ÜµHe had competed with more than 3000 hopefuls from all over Botswana to become the My African Dream Judges Choice of 2009.... but he did not stop there! That night, in front of 650 people, BTV's camera crew, and thousands watching at home on their televisions, Moonga's dream of becoming a professional singer took a step closer to becoming a reality. Mara Louw, internationally acclaimed singer, and former South African Idols judge, performed with all the finalists that night. She singled Moonga out, brought him to the front of the stage and told everyone that to ensure this young talent not be allowed to fall through the cracks, he needed professional training.‚ÜµSince then he was offered a place at the world-renowned Drakensberg Boys' Choir School in South Africa, with a scholarship to help part-fund the tuition fees. Drakensberg has a fantastic reputation, giving excellent academic schooling as well as first rate musical training. They've toured the worldwide, even singing behind the Iron Curtain and for the Pope. The school is multicultural and multilingual and has been since it started in 1967 (in the midst of apartheid). The boys learn classical, jazz, African and pop music, creating a diverse repertoire and breaking down cultural and musical barriers. He was invited to perform at the Barclay's Annual Fundraiser Show in November. He also performed for the President of Botswana, Ian Khama, for the first time singing his M.A.D. victory song, \\"Hallelujah\\" alongside Rose-Marie Hamoir and he performed in Stuart White's musical production, \\"Rags to Riches.\\" = 2010: \\"Keeping The Dream Alive\\" = In 2010, Rosalyn Beukes and Rusette Auton came up with the idea of Moonga hosting his own concerts to raise funds for Drakensberg. His first ever show, entitled \\"Keeping The Dream Alive\\" was a two-night show held during the Maitisong Festival on 27 and 28 April, and another in May, for the public and corporate. He and his friends arranged the show with multiple acts ranging from singing to dancing. Moonga, his family and friends tried to raise the rest of the money needed for his school fees, travel and other expenses so he could have started as soon as possible. Drakensberg Boys Choir had also recognised his incredible talent and were holding his space for him, but time ran out. He had another show held at Maitisong in September called \\"Moonga & Friends.\\" The idea was not to continue raising funds for Drakensberg \\"because it seemed we were getting nowhere,\\" said K. So they decided to use the funds for Moonga to get voice training locally and he learned Piano with David Slater Music.Article \\"On a Saturday evening, he put on a show that lasted two and a half hours. Sure, he had support ‚Äì he didn't sing every song, but he carried that show far more than certain stars I've been to see. Stars I've paid considerably more to see. He even moved me to tears at one point. He works hard and he's a nice kid, not a brat or a diva. He has a dream ... he's not looking for handouts ... he is asking the public to help him, help himself .. and he's working so hard to make that dream come true,\\" said Auton. In February, he was invited to perform at the Tachila Charity Event at the Gaborone International Convention Center, singing for and meeting the President of Botswana for the second time. In November 2010, he sang for the President of Botswana for the third time, with his twin sister, as he visited Rainbow High School to open their hall. He also was the only artist invited to entertain at the Botswana Youth Sports Meeting held at the GICC in November. In the same month, he was invited for the second time to perform at the Barclay's Annual Fundraiser Show at Maitisong. In December, he was invited to speak to orphans and children about social problems at \\"Inspiring Youth\\" (held at Mokolodi Game Reserve).  2011‚Äì13  In February 2011, Moonga was the youngest cast member of Mandi Mash's \\"My Funny Valentine Part II\\" held at the Gaborone Sun Conference Center. In March, he went against past My African Dream alumni for the Battle of The Finalists competition. He performed various renditions of songs with guitarist, Cedric Ncube, one of the major renditions being Jessie J's \\"Price TagBattle of the Finalists performance\\" and Rihanna's \\"What's My Name.\\"Battle of the Finalists He made it up to the Top 3, being eliminated at the Grand Finale.

The event was held at the Gaborone International Convention Center and was aired live on BTV. On 13 November, K. released a studio recorded version online of his M.A.D victory song, Hallelujah over Justin Timberlake and Matt Morris' instrumental version. In February 2012, Moonga and his twin sister performed a full set at the Maru-a-Pula School's 40th Anniversary Family Fun Day alongside Atomic Aura. On 11 May, a dance/club song entitled \\"One Love\\" was released. It was produced by The OmegA Man.

The building was formerly a national school and now accommodates 53 homeless people, providing training for a period of up to two years to try to get them into work. The St Mungo Community Housing Association, working as St Mungo's, is a charity registered in England to help homeless people. Soup run St.Mungo's Community began as a splinter group from The Simon Community which was started by a former probation officer Anton Wallich-Clifford and was unique among organisations for its success in alcoholic recoveries. This was essentially due to its controversial approach of allowing drinking actually on the premises. The lease for the East End shelter in Sclater street was ending and it was at a time when shortage of money drove the Simon Community into constant reorganisation. However, due to the good services of an M P James Allason, the chairman of the East End house managed to break through the almost impenetrable bureaucracy that surrounded the London County Council. Unaware that it was for a new charity they offered the short lease on a house in Home Road, Wandsworth, which was due to be demolished in two years time. It was unfortunate that once it was realised that St.Mungos was not yet even registered as a charity the young employee who completed the actual arrangement was sacked. Harry Stone had a choice of two people for the job of warden, one was the current warden of the closing Simon wet house the other a young ambitious worker at the Simon headquarters. The current warden was a reformed alcoholic and it was therefore felt he might not be able to withstand the considerable pressure he would almost certainly be under. So it was a fortunate gamble that Jim Horne was chosen. Jim was already acquainted with Geoffrey Fernyhough who had been managing director of the Green Line coaches and he agreed to become the new Chairman while Harry Stone became secretary. treasurer. and fund raiser. Jim ridiculed the suggestion the enterprise should be called The Home Road Hostel and pressed for the name St.Mungo‚Äôs. Being Scottish, he believed the powers of Glasgow Cathedral might be persuaded to make an ample donation if it was named after their patron saint. Unfortunately it proved to be a false hope. But otherwise Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and ability drove St. Mungo to a sure start and onwards with ever increasing success. Among his early helpers was Graham Parr who in turn broke away to start up the original Vauxhall Broadway hostel. Due to the enlightened support of Wandsworth Council, even though they had never been officially informed of the occupation in Home Road, the Mayor opened the second house, which was also in Home Road. It was not long before St. Mungos gained the interest of the Department of Health and Social Services and Jim inveigled the Head of the Department and even the Minister Sir Keith Joseph to spend an evening on the soup run. Even so it was a surprise when the department suddenly offered major financial support so that the Community could become an experimental embryo for further possible development. The amateur management had up to that time worked along unconventional lines. The Trustees had given Jim considerable licence over some of his machinations. So it had to be completely reorganised. Qualified accountants, medical practitioners and psychiatrists were appointed as additional trustees. Out of this it soon became clear that whenever either of the original Trustees held opposing views or questioned Jim‚Äôs dealings, the new Trustees, quite correctly, backed Jim since he had the responsibility for the daily running. In the late 1960s, it faltered. Its management started cutting back and so, in May 1969, its soup run was to be ended. The soup run was a nightly distribution of soup in six locations in London's West End where homeless rough sleepers or \\"dossers\\" gathered. This was provided by Wandsworth Council for a nominal rent and in 1970, the council provided three more houses nearby. The fourth house was used as an office by the developing organisation. Hostels Splits and mergers. The original trust is now Hestia Housing and Support while the separate housing association became the main St Mungo's charity which merged with Broadway Housing in 2015 becoming for a short period St Mungo's Broadway before reverting to St Mungo's in 2016. A large hostel, accommodating up to 200 people, was started in a disused Marmite factory in Vauxhall in 1973. This large building, on the corner of Kennington Lane and Durham Street, had previously been notorious for the disgusting smell of the production process. In the same year, another large hostel was opened in central London. This building, in Suffolk Street, had formerly been the Charing Cross Hospital. The hospital had been relocated to Fulham and Jim Horne negotiated cheap terms for occupation of the old building with the Greater London Council. There was a schism in the organisation in 1979. Jim Horne left and the organisation split into three. The Charing Cross hostel became the flagship of a new company ‚Äî St Mungo's Community Housing Association. The Marmite factory hostel became the foundation of another new trust ‚Äî Bondway Shelter ‚Äî which then became a housing association too. The original St Mungo's Community Trust remained to focus upon the soup run but then partnered with other organisations, such as the Shepherd's Bush Housing Association, to start another hostel in Fulham. In 1980, the soup run was passed on to the Bondway organisation and the original trust now operates as Hestia Housing and Support. It was renamed to avoid confusion with the St Mungo's Community Housing Association, which is also now a registered charity and operates as \\"St Mungo's\\" having briefly become St Mungo's Broadway in 2015 after merging with Broadway Housing. St Mungo's is now the largest charity dealing with the homeless in London. In 2010, it provided a bed for over 1500 people each night. In 2011, they had over a hundred sites across southern England providing accommodation or other services to the homeless. Projects The charity has pioneered a variety of novel programmes and initiatives. =\\"Bricks and Mortar\\" and \\"ReVive\\" training programmes= Bricks and Mortar provides the homeless with training and experience of bricklaying. ReVive is a similar scheme which develops other building skills such as plastering and decorating. =\\"LifeWorks\\" project= The LifeWorks project started in 2008, providing psychodynamics psychotherapy to homeless people, especially those who are addicted to drugs or alcohol. =\\"Putting Down Roots\\" project= Jonathan Trustram showing the use of self-seeding plants by the Putting Down Roots project in the Mint Street park. These guided tours formed part of the Chelsea Fringe in 2012. The Putting Down Roots project enables the homeless and hostel dwellers to develop gardens and other horticultural features. It was started by Martin Snowden for St Mungo's in 2000 and has been sponsored and supported by a variety of partners. In 2012, it was still going strong with Jonathan Trustram leading the development of gardens at St John's Church, Waterloo and other places. =Street stories= In 2009, for the 40th anniversary of the organisation, a project was started to record the oral history of the homeless. Six clients were given training in this and they then interviewed other clients, recording the history of their time on the streets and other recollections. These were then presented in an exhibition at the LSE and the results were then archived in Southwark Library.  Controversy  In March 2018, St Mungo's revealed to the Guardian newspaper that it had cooperated with Home Office immigration, compliance and enforcement (ICE) teams, who are responsible for identifying rough sleepers who were deemed as living in the UK illegally, even EU citizens who are lawful migrants. Other organisation in the charitable sector criticised St Mungo's involvement with the ICE teams. The North East London Migrant Action group said: ‚ÄúThe role of homelessness charities should be to uphold the rights of vulnerable people. St Mungo‚Äôs have forfeited the trust of asylum seekers and other migrants who sleep rough by working with the Home Office who have people deported from the UK'. While acknowledging that their outreach teams had worked with the Home Office, St Mungo's responded that their role was to protect the rights of the homeless: \\"We took the decision that it was better to be there to provide support to vulnerable people sleeping rough than not be able to advocate for them at these times. Our role should not be confused with that of enforcement agencies.\\" References External links *\\"Our history of helping homeless people\\", a history of the current St Mungo's *40 year history History of Hestia, the original St Mungo's Community Trust *A history of Thames Reach and homelessness in London, the successor to the Bondway spin-off *About the Simon community, which started the original soup run and has now restarted such outreach projects Category:Homelessness charities in the United Kingdom Category:Homeless shelters in the United Kingdom ","title":"St Mungo's (charity)"},{"id":"39819755","text":"Grega ≈Ωemlja defeated Martin Fischer 6‚Äì4, 7‚Äì5 in the final to win the first edition of the tournament.

Compiled by poet and critic Gerrit Komrij and published by Bert Bakker, it quickly became a hotly discussed book and a yardstick for canonicity, nicknamed \\"The Bible of Dutch poetry\\". Controversy over Komrij's selection erupted almost immediately and even led to a lawsuit (which was quickly dismissed); it is generally agreed, though, that the anthology has had significant influence on the canon of Dutch poetry. Background By the time he published the anthology, Komrij had established himself as a notable critic of literature and other cultural expressions, and as a poet had been honored with various awards (he won the poetry prize of the city of Amsterdam in 1970, for Alle vlees is als gras, and the Herman Gorter prize in 1982, for De os op de klokketoren). His own poetry, which critics sometimes found difficult to read and take seriously, was traditional in form and sometimes \\"bizarre-anecdotal\\" in content, very different from the formerly experimental poetry which, by the 1970s, had become the standard of Dutch poetry. Revisions and associated anthologies By 1987 the book was in its eighth edition, and in 2004 a revised edition was published under the slightly altered title Nederlandse po√´zie van de 19de t/m de 21ste eeuw in 2000 en enige gedichten. Komrij published similar anthologies of 12th through 16th- century, and of 17th and 18th-century poetry, De Nederlandse po√´zie van de 17de en 18de eeuw, in 1996. All three were bundled together in 1996, in 4100 pages, with an again-revised selection of the modern poetry. Inclusions and exclusions As soon as the book appeared, poets and critics began counting: Komrij had set ten as the highest number of poems to be included by any single poet. Controversy erupted very quickly over his meager selection of poetry from the Vijftigers (article in Dutch), the experimental poetry movement of the post-World War II period. Simon Vinkenoog, for instance, who is frequently seen as the founder of the movement, only got one poem in. Members and apologists of that movement criticized Komrij for selecting too little from the Vijftigers, and for not selecting their best poems. J. Bernlef, for instance, lambasted Komrij's anthology as \\"willful attempt to sweep one of the most important poetic movements from the 20th century under the rug\\" in a newspaper review.\\"Een welbewuste poging om een van de belangrijkste stromingen in de twintigste-eeuwse Nederlandse po√´zie onder tafel te werken\\", Zuiderent 842. Four of the country's best-known poets (Lucebert, Remco Campert, Gerrit Kouwenaar, and Bert Schierbeek) filed suit against Bert Bakker, irate that Komrij had not selected their best work and claiming that their publishers had not given permission for reproduction. The lawsuit was dismissed quickly, the judge ruling that such anthologies do not require copyright clearance if fewer than one hundred lines per copyright holder were printed. That Afrikaner poet Elisabeth Eybers was not included is seen as evidence that the Dutch literary establishment is not sure how to treat her. Noteworthy inclusions are the 19th-century poets frequently referred to pejoratively as \\"ministers\\" (they were theologians and Protestant ministers), the most notable example being Nicolaas Beets (others are Jan Jakob Lodewijk ten Kate, Petrus Augustus de Genestet, and Everhardus Johannes Potgieter). Komrij is credited with having restored those poets to canonicity‚ÄîBeets, in the 1996 edition, was represented with 11 poems, causing one reviewer to joke that he had become the ubergod in Komrij's poetic pantheon.

Contents Red Death refers to a malevolent entity spawned in ancient Egypt during the \\"golden age of magic.\\" It proceeded to wreak havoc for a few thousand years, promoting violence and catalyzing disasters. By the late 19th century, the era in which the game unfolds, the world totters on the edge of the abyss. The player characters are poised to challenge the Red Death and its minions. The Masque of the Red Death setting combines real-world history with legends and literature. Thus, necromancers practice dark arts among the slave traders of New Orleans, while Buenos Aires agricultural barons attempt to squelch rumors of monstrous winged serpents. Spirit creatures stalk the settlers of the American West. Sherlock Holmes shares a railroad car with Count Dracula. Unlike the basic Ravenloft setting, where mysterious mists divide the realm into distinct settings, the Gothic Earth setting has no divisions. Masque begins by replacing the traditional character classes with soldiers (like fighters, but can't specialize in favored weapons), adepts (wizards with limited magic and no school specialization), mystics (priests with limited magic), and tradesmen (like thieves, but without thief abilities). All player characters must be human. Additionally, player characters are encouraged to select character kits from a list of vocations such as Cavalryman, Journalist, and Laborer. Nonweapon proficiencies, optional in the standard AD&D; game, are required here; among the choices are Chemistry, Photography, and Criminology. Masque also introduces Ravenloft setting players to gunpowder. Armor provides no protection against firearms used at short range, and only modest protection at medium and long ranges. Characters attempting to empty their guns may take advantage of a two-part combat round, making half their attacks in part one, the rest in part two. To reflect the increased damage from bullets, any damage die showing a 6 is rerolled. A caster cannot use spells unless the caster makes a successful proficiency check. Magical items are rare, and in some cases, unavailable. Even acquiring a spell is risky; if a character attempting to learn a new spell fails a System Shock roll, he loses one point of Strength or Constitution. The rule book ends with an informative chapter of referee tips, covering rule modifications from the Ravenloft boxed set. Three fully developed adventures are included, each in its own 32-page booklet, called \\"Red Tide\\", \\"Red Jack\\", and \\"Red Death\\" respectively. Publication history Masque of the Red Death and other Tales is an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game supplement for the Ravenloft setting, published by TSR, Inc. as a boxed set containing one 128-page book, three 32-page books, one three-panel referee screen, one 21\\" X 32\\" map sheet, one 21\\" X 32\\" poster. Design was by William W. Connors with D.J. Heinrich, Colin McComb, and Shane Hensley; editing was by Anne Brown, Jonatha Ariadne Caspian, and Richard Pike-Brown. Illustrations were by Stephen Fabian and Ned Dameron, with a cover by Robh Ruppel. Reception Rick Swan reviewed Masque of the Red Death and Other Tales for Dragon magazine #216 (April 1995). He declares that Masque of the Red Death is cause for celebration, especially for players whose AD&D; game campaigns have gone stale. Not exactly the Ravenloft setting and not exactly a new game, Connors' little mutant is the most provocative AD&D; variant since the Spelljammer campaign.\\" He commented: \\"Balancing blood-soaked imagery with humorous flourishes [...] Masque deftly combines the gloom of White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade game and the whimsy of R. Talsorian's Castle Falkenstein game. Though Masque would've benefited form a tighter focus‚Äîwhy not just concentrate on Europe instead of struggling to cover the whole world?‚Äîthere's more to embrace than complain about.\\" Swan continued: \\"Still, Masque's drawing card isn't the Victorian setting. As good as it is, we‚Äôve been here before, not just in Castle Falkenstein, but also in Chaosium's Cthulhu by Gaslight (an expansion for the Call of Cthulhu game) and TSR‚Äôs own For Faerie, Queen, and Country supplement for the Amazing Engine game. The main attraction is the game system.\\" He added that for firearms, its \\"Simple, common sense rules ease the transition from crossbows to carbines\\" and for its rules on magic, \\"Reduced reliance on magic further nudges Masque in the direction of realism.\\" He commented on the three adventure booklets, saying that they \\"answer most of the questions about staging campaigns. Red Tide serves up few surprises‚Äîanyone who can't anticipate the plot twists hasn't seen enough late shows‚Äîbut plenty of action and a lot of fun. Red Jack, a Jack the Ripper take-off, put my entire party in the cemetery‚Äîconsider that a recommendation. Red Death uses Edgar Allan Poe as a springboard for a tricky mystery. Swan contended that graphically, \\"the Ravenloft campaign remains the most conservative horror RPG on the market; compared to the in-your-face White Wolf line, the Ravenloft setting is about as visually compelling as the Cryptkeeper cartoon series. [...] Though the referee screen does a nice job of displaying the tables, the posters don't amount to much. One features a more or less standard map of the world, intended, I guess, for those who don't have access to an atlas. The other depicts the cover art and the Ravenloft logo, intended, I guess, for those inclined to help TSR promote their products.\\" Swan concluded the review by saying: \\"The Victorian setting's fine, but it's a sidebar to the system overhaul. Masque of the Red Death makes a persuasive case for reality-based role-playing, where wits count more than muscle and a shotgun packs more punch than a fireball. Endearingly human, these are the only AD&D; game characters I'd consider using as investigators in a Call of Cthulhu game or, for that matter, as adversaries in a Vampire campaign. And nitpickers who've been clamoring for a streamlined, skill-based AD&D; game ought to be dancing in the streets. Masque of the Red Death doesn't qualify as the Third Edition of the AD&D; game, but it's a reasonable facsimile‚Äîcall it Second Edition, Version 2.0. May Connors' next mutant be just as ornery.\\" References Category:Ravenloft ","title":"Masque of the Red Death and Other Tales"},{"id":"39819820","text":"The Thoothukudi - Nazareth Diocese is a diocese of Church of South India in Tamil nadu state of India.The diocese is one among the 22 dioceses of Church of South India in India.The cathedral of the diocese is St. John's Cathedral at Nazareth, Tamil Nadu.

Contents Red Steel features a dust, vermeil, which grants extraordinary powers to anyone who brews it up and drinks it, but also may cause excruciating physical deformities, and rocks, cinnabryl, which can be formed into jewelry that fends off the side effects of vermeil, and shaped into weapons capable of wounding magical creatures. Both substances permeate the war-ravaged lands of the Savage Coast (introduced in 1985's X9 The Savage Coast module), spewing enchantments. The box includes two booklets, the larger one devoted the game systems, and the smaller one to the Savage Coast setting itself. Rounding out the package are three maps and a compact disc. Originally colonized by outcasts and criminals, the subtropical shoreline now consists of a string of self-contained city-states populated by lizard men, the feline rakasta, and intelligent spiders. Vermeil has tinted the plants, sky, and even the residents' skin a dull red. A thorough history provides insight into the region's brutal past. The Dream River, bordered by amber lotuses whose pollen induces sleep, runs from the canine kingdom of Renardy to the Plain of Dreams. The aranea, a race of devious arachnids, occupy Herath, the City of Mages. In addition to the usual humans and elves, player characters can be aranea, rakasta, lupins (dogheaded humanoids), or tortles (bipedal turtles). New character kits include the Gaucho and Webmaster. Virtually all intelligent creatures, PCs included, gain magical abilities called Legacies when they enter the area. Most characters get a single Legacy, though some, such as those taking the Inheritor character kit, may acquire several. Legacies resemble standard AD&D; game spells, but as soon as a character gains a Legacy, they begin to lose points from an ability score (chosen by the DM). The character also begins to turn red and develop a physical deformity related to their Legacy. These deformities may be avoided by wearing a cinnabryl amulet. Cinnabryl, however, loses its protective abilities at the rate of one ounce per week. Publication history The Red Steel set is an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game supplement published by TSR, Inc. as a boxed set containing one 128-page book, one 32-page book, three 21\\" X 32\\" map sheets, and one audio compact disc (15 tracks; playing time: 62: 28). Based directly on Bruce Heard's The Voyage of the Princess Ark articles published in Dragon and later in Champions of Mystara, development for the AD&D; Game was produced by Tim Beach, editing by Lester Smith, and illustrations by Randy Post and Dee Barnett. The audio was by Gordon Hookailo (producer), Flint Dille (interactive director), Buzz Dixon (associate producer and script), Tim Beach (script), and Dominic Messinger (score). Reception Rick Swan reviewed Red Steel for Dragon magazine #216 (April 1995). He commented: \\"Most AD&D; game supplements feature personalities and settings. Some feature treasures and monsters. Red Steel is the first to feature dust and rocks.\\" Swan compared the set to Masque of the Red Death and Other Tales, which he reviewed in the same column, suggesting that \\"Red Steel is the flipside of Masque of the Red Death; where Masque reduces the role of magic, Red Steel beefs it up, big time.\\" He commented about length about the included compact disc, \\"which I could've lived without. It's not that it's badly produced‚Äîin fact, it's better engineered than the last Green Day album‚ÄîI just can't figure out what do with it. Most of the disc contains mood music, some reminiscent of a film soundtrack, the rest sounding like it belongs in a medieval dentist's office. Elsewhere, a poor man's Bela Lugosi narrates a track of introductory material. For those wanting to enhance their game sessions with something other than the radio, the CD fills the bill. For everybody else . . . well, I wouldn't buy Red Steel just for the music. He comments that, \\"Sadly, there are no full-blown adventures, just a few outlines (though they're pretty good ones). And with so much territory to cover, we only get a‚Äîsigh‚Äîcursory peek at the various cultures.\\" Swan states that \\"as in Masque of the Red Death the setting is secondary to the rules. And the rules are a wacky delight.\\" Swan concludes his review by saying: \\"Engrossing and nervy, Red Steel takes the AD&D; game in a lot of unexpected directions, and I'm not just talking about fighters being able to blast magic missiles. The economics are different; consider the trade ramifications where cynnabryl is more precious than gold. The balance of power is different; how, for instance, does a ruler keep the peace in a community of self-absorbed spell-casters? Even the animals are different; it's possible to run into a werewolf with red fur or a spike-covered goblin. On the downside, Red Steel's emphasis on rules doesn't leave much room for the civilization. I wanted to know more about cynnabryl black marketeers, vermeil cultists, tortle armament merchants. Put it this way: if TSR offered to swap the CD for a Savage Coast source book, I'd Federal Express mine to them this afternoon. As it stands, Red Steel is a tantalizing introduction to an exciting world, one I hope TSR revisits soon.\\" References Category:Mystara ","title":"Red Steel (boxed set)"},{"id":"39819832","text":"Rogues in Lankhmar is an accessory for the 2nd edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game based on Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar setting.

The book provides hints on what player characters (PCs) may want to do in Huzuz: An ethoist priest wants to preach in the great Golden Mosque, so the Mosque entry tells whom to talk to.

Varney commented on the cover art: \\"Robh Ruppel's superb cover painting shows Halima gazing placidly from a palace window on the minarets and golden domes of Huzuz, the cat by her side. This quiet piece embodies the exotic Al-Qadim campaign better than any fight scene with genies and corsairs.\\" He also felt that \\"City of Delights excels in its clear view of what player characters (PCs) want to do in Huzuz.\\" He added that \\"the DM struggling to digest all this will appreciate the clear, useful campaign advice, unique in the Al-Qadim line\\". Varney concluded the review with his evaluation: \\"Whether the PCs visit the Caliph's splendid palace (based on Topkapi palace in Istanbul), Mad Aja in the Grand Bazaar, the sewer lair of the evil yak-men, Gorar the singing barber, or the hidden temple of the Flamedeath Fellowship, City of Delights meets the DM's needs for an exotic Baghdadian campaign base. Though it has the same demanding learning curve as the Land of Fate [reviewed in the same column], and it really needs an index, this imaginative box should prove more immediately and easily useful.\\" References Category:Al-Qadim ","title":"City of Delights"},{"id":"39819838","text":"Ruined Kingdoms is an accessory for the 2nd edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, published in 1994.

In these adventures, the player characters meet the gibbering beggar-prophet Adil, find a cursed ceramic disk, meet a pleasant mason wasp, fight yak men, and run afoul of an ancient Arch-Geomancer. Traveling to the jungles of eastern Zakhara to solve the mystery of the disk, the PCs model for three giant sisters who sculpt topiary shrubs, fight serpent cultists, visit the Isle of the Elephant, and learn that one PC is the long-lost heir of a rich merchant family.

The framing adventure, about the disk, starts the PCs at levels 4-6, but leads to a climactic fight against extremely tough villains where 9th-12th level heroes should expect a high body count.

Publication history Corsairs of the Great Sea was written by Nicky Rea. Reception Allen Varney reviewed Corsairs of the Great Sea for Dragon magazine #219 (July 1995).

Varney stated in his conclusion of the review: \\"This box makes more references than usual to the Forgotten Realms, where Zakhara is nominally placed. I'm uncomfortable with this, because the Realms already have three desert cultures (including one, Anauroch, with the same cultural roots as the Al-Qadim setting), and because Zakhara is more than a different place, it's a different genre of adventure. But Corsairs even brings in a spelljamming ship from Kara-Tur, which is about as non-Arabian as you get.

As part of the DMGR series, the information in this book is intended for use by the Dungeon Master to develop villains and NPCs, and is not recommended for use by players. Contents The Complete Book of Necromancers follows the format of the previous \\"Complete\\" books, covering character creation, kits, proficiencies, and devices. Unlike most \\"Complete\\" books, which are written for players as much as Dungeon Masters, the Complete Necromancer is intended for DMs. Character kits introduced include the Anatomist, Philosopher, and Deathslayer. The book presents history (the differences between Roman and Celtic witches, how Eastern societies viewed death) and sociology (the cultural stigma of necromancy, how wizards deal with discrimination). Humans can specialize in necromancy, as can drow, dragons, githyanki, even undead. The Allies chapter provides rules for apprentices, henchmen, and familiars. The death gods are described, and rounding out the book are a set of ready-to- play NPCs (one per character kit) and a fully developed campaign base called Sahu, Isle of the Necromancer Kings. The book also provides an analysis of the relationship between spells and alignments. It sorts spells into three color categories, each linked to a particular ethos: Black necromancy, encompassing spells that bring physical injury or spiritual annihilation, is associated with evil practitioners; gray necromancy, to which the majority of necromantic spells belong, are appropriate for neutral wizards; and good wizards are drawn to white necromancy, with spells that restore life and fortify living bodies. Finally, there are 15 pages of new spells. The book focuses on developing and playing characters of the Necromancer type of specialist wizard, with some attention given to death priests. Kurtz discusses the moral implications of characters who study the necromantic arts, as well as the way in which societies regard such characters. The book provides new spells for both wizards and clerics (as well as new priest spheres), new kits, and equipment geared toward practitioners of necromancy, as well as new nonweapon proficiencies. Additionally, the book covers organizations and schools for necromancers, as well as discussing ways in which studying necromancy may lead to physical disfigurement of the character. Similarly to the PHBR series of player aid books, The Complete Book of Necromancers includes advice on running a campaign involving necromancers, and provides details on the types of hirelings and retainers such a spellcaster might employ. Kurtz also provides examples of different types of necromancers, including Kazerabet, a villain character he initially created in the Al-Qadim supplement Cities of Bone, and details the island of Sahu, which was featured in his supplement Ruined Kingdoms. Publication history The Complete Book of Necromancers was written by Steve Kurtz for TSR. Published in 1995, the editing was by Matt Forbeck, black and white art by Karl Waller, and color art by Brom, Jeff Easley, and John and Laura Lakey, and Robh Ruppel. Reception Rick Swan reviewed The Complete Book of Necromancers for Dragon magazine #222 (October 1995). He comments that \\"Kurtz's literate, no-nonsense style makes this one of the most readable entries in the series. He employs, however, a pair of premises that may not sit well with everyone, especially those who like their AD&D; in-your-face and unconditional.\\" He found the character kits \\"intriguing but tame\\", especially the Anatomist and Philosopher, and noted that even the Deathslayer, \\"a selfless enemy of dangerous undead, comes off as a pussycat\\". Swan found that \\"the serious tone gives necromancers an unexpected depth, certain to satisfy those who prefer Masterpiece Theater to Beavis and Butthead. But players used to the unapologetic assault of Werewolf and Call of Cthulhu may find it all a little too, uh, nice.\\" He goes on to say, \\"If you buy the approach, however, you're in for a treat. Kurtz has packed the book with sharp insights and inspired mechanics.\\" Swan found the death gods to be \\"masterful inventions; the Queen of the Noose rules as the patron of premeditated killing, and followers of the God of Pestilence foster disease by harvesting slime from corpses.\\" Swan concludes in his evaluation: \\"If you're a DM who runs an ordered campaign, and you're in the market for necromancer NPCs, this is the book for you. But if you're a player interested in ruling a kingdom of zombies or sewing tentacles to your chest, keep looking. Reserved and brainy, The Complete Book of Necromancers is the role-playing equivalent of a college text, an erudite collection of provocative ideas.

Although mostly associated with the Vijayanagara Emperors it was built much earlier in 11th century by the Yadava rulers. History Chandragiri was under the rule of Yadavaraya for about three centuries and came under the control of the Vijayanagarayadava rulers in 1367. It came into prominence during 1560s during the reign of Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya. Later, the most famous Vijayanagara emperor Srikrishna Devaraya, was kept in this fort as a prince, till his coronation at Penukonda. It is also said that he met his future queen Chinna Devi at this fort. Chandragiri was the 4th capital of Vijayanagara Empire, Rayas shifted their capital to here when the Golconda sultans attacked Penukonda. In 1646 the fort was annexed to the Golkonda territory and subsequently came under Kingdom of Mysore rule. It went into oblivion from 1792 onward. The Raja Mahal Palace is now an archaeological museum. The palace is an example of Indo- Sarcen architecture of Vijayanagara period. The crowning towers represents the Hindu architectural elements. The palace was constructed using stone, brick, lime mortar and devoid of timber. Some of important kavyas or epic poems are written in this fort under the patronage of Vijayanagara kings. Inside the fort are eight temples, Raja Mahal, Rani Mahal and other ruined structures. Inside the fort are Raja Mahal and Rani Mahal which are quite well maintained for more than 300 years and Raja Mahal is converted as Archeological Museum by Arechological Survey of India. The museum holds models of fort, main temple and other structures of surrounding area. Both of these building were constructed without using wood and only lime, brick and morter was used. Rani Mahal has flat roof and at base level it has stable and epigraphical evidence says that this building was also used as commanders quarters. The fort is the place where the pact of granting lands for Fort St. George to the British was signed by Vijayanagara King Sri Rangaraya during August 1639. Vyasathirtha Sage Vyasatirtha used to reside here and was a spiritual advisor to King Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya and he was entrusted with worship at Tirumala temple. Vyasathirtha remained in Chandragiri in the court of Narasimha Raya II. The fort is at a distance of 11 km from the famous Tirupati Temple and there is a foot path to temple from this fort, which is the reason the sage resided here.

It was established in memory of Jimmy Reid, a well- known trade union activist, by the Editorial Board of the Scottish Left Review. It was officially launched on the first anniversary of Reid's death on 10 August 2011, with its activities focusing primarily upon the publication and dissemination of policy reports and an annual lecture (of which Alex Salmond, Len McCluskey and Nicola Sturgeon have been the first to deliver). The Foundation is run by a Project Board, a Director and Convenor, with an array of patrons including the likes of Alex Ferguson and Aamer Anwar. History The agenda of the Foundation is to promote and develop a form of socialism and social democracy in line with the views and perspective of Jimmy Reid. However, the Foundation is independent of any of the political parties that Reid was a member or supporter of, namely, the Communist, Labour and SNP parties. The Foundation's highest-profile project, started in 2013, is the Common Weal, a blueprint for an independent Scotland following the Nordic model of social security. The blueprint was set to be discussed at the Scottish National Party's annual conference in 2013, and was backed by figures such as Dennis Canavan and Jim Mather. The Common Weal was also discussed at Labour for Independence's first conference in July 2013. In August 2013, the Jimmy Reid Foundation led calls for a memorial to be erected in honour of those who opposed the outbreak of World War I. Its \\"alternative World War One Commemoration Committee\\" identified John Wheatley, John Maclean, Mary Barbour, Helen Crawfurd, Jimmy Maxton, Agnes Dollan, Willie Gallacher, Rev James Barr, and Keir Hardie in its list of prominent opponents of the war. Following the departure of the Foundation's first director, Robin McAlpine, to concentrate on the Common Weal, the Foundation has concentrated on a smaller number of projects, attempting to gain more subsequent follow through on each of those. The Foundation's work is initiated and monitored by its Project Board consisting of representatives from a number of unions (PCS, UNISON, Unite) as well as progressive and radical academics and policy analysts.

It was aired on May 20, 2013. The episode was written by Todd Slavkin & Darren Swimmer and it was directed by Andy Wolk. Plot A bounty hunter chases a Castithan through the Defiance marketplace. When the Castithan drops a locket that explodes injuring several people, Nolan knocks him down and arrests him. The bounty hunter turns out to be a friend of Nolan's and former comrade in arms, named Eddie (Rob Stewart). Eddie tries to convince Nolan to give him the outlaw but Nolan takes him under custody instead. Tommy (Dewshane Williams) identifies the Castithan as Pol Madis (Daniel Kash), the person who designs many weapons for wars. Eddie tells Nolan that Earth Republic wants Madis to try him for war crimes. While Yewll (Trenna Keating) examines Madis, he asks her if people of Defiance know about her involvement in the Pale Wars. He threatens her that if she does not help him escape, then he will tell everyone. Yewll denies any accusations and says that he is confusing her with someone else. Later, a bag of powder is dropped through the cell window that Madis can use to escape but it is unknown who dropped the bag. Nolan suspects that the person who dropped the bag was Eddie, but Eddie convinces him that he was not involved and they start searching for Madis together. Meanwhile, an Earth Republic representative, Conor Lang (Gale Harold), arrives in Defiance to take Madis and Amanda (Julie Benz) attempts to negotiate Madis' extradition. Conor, with who Amanda seems she had something in the past, tells her that Earth Republic wants Madis so much that they will tear the city apart just to find him. Madis, after his escape, goes to Datak's (Tony Curran) house forcing him to help him escape from the town. Datak, not having a second choice, drives him out of Defiance, but they are stopped by Nolan, Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas), Tommy and Eddie. Irisa and Tommy drive Datak back home and Nolan stays back with Eddie and Madis. Nolan plans to give Madis to Eddie but when he learns that Earth Republic does not really want Madis to try him but to use him for making new weapons, he kills him. Conor arrives at the scene and when he sees that Madis is dead he tells Nolan that this is not his jurisdiction. Eddie takes the blame of Madis' death and is arrested. Meanwhile, Quentin (Justin Rain) studies the book and the artifacts his brother left behind to understand what Luke was trying to do. Nicky (Fionnula Flanagan) sees him and she shows interest in his findings. When Quentin tells his dad Rafe (Graham Greene) about it, Rafe advises him to destroy the book, the artifacts and everything that has to do with this subject because they are the reason his brother is dead. Quentin is willing to do so, but when he has a vision of his brother telling him not to, he changes his mind and keeps the artifact. In the meantime, Birch (Steven McCarthy) breaks into Rafe's house to find the artifact. When Quentin gets back home, they struggle and Quentin kills him, egged on by another vision of his brother Luke. The episode ends with Nolan telling Irisa more about her \\"Uncle\\" Eddie; Quentin disposing of Birch's body in the mines; and Eddie being transported in shackles by Earth Republic forces. We see that Eddie has a bag of powder like the one Madis used to escape hidden in his boot that now he uses to escape.

The screenplay was written by Ray Bradbury (using the pseudonym of Douglas Spaulding) based upon his 1957 short story, \\"In a Season of Calm Weather.\\"Douglas Spaulding is a protagonist in several of Bradbury's works, most notably Dandelion Wine.First published in Playboy (January 1957) and later anthologized in the book A Medicine for Melancholy. Future Academy Award winner Vilmos Zsigmond was the cinematographer. There were two directors. Serge Bourguignon was the original director whose rough cut was rejected by Warner Brothers. Another director, Robert Sallin, was hired to reshoot some scenes and to do the changed ending. Even with the reworked scenes, the movie was never released to theaters in the United States. It was sold for distribution to TV networks and stations with Sallin receiving the director's credit. Plot summary George Smith (Albert Finney) is a bored, young San Francisco architect, at loose ends and feeling a bit depressed after finishing a project in which he felt his contribution was of little consequence. After he and his wife Alice (Yvette Mimieux) attend a vacuous party, they go home and George reassesses his life. George thinks about how much he admires Pablo Picasso, the great artist, who pursues his dreams with abandon. He suddenly feels an overwhelming urge to meet the artist and proposes to his wife that they fly to France that very evening in search of him. They arrive in the south of France and after a day or two of searching, arrive at the gate of his villa, only to be told that he sees no one. After a dismal dinner at a local restaurant, George goes off to a bar, while Alice returns to the hotel. The next morning, she is awakened by a drunken George, who returns with an equally drunken Frenchman whom he has befriended. By this time, George's obsessive quest has begun to wear thin. She refuses to accompany him to Spain in pursuit of a famous matador who, he has been told, is a friend of Picasso's and may be persuaded to furnish an introduction to Picasso. George goes off by himself and has an adventure in Spain with the matador, while Alice wanders about the French town alone. She meets a blind painter and his wife, who invite her home for supper and give her one of his paintings. George returns, thoroughly disappointed and disgusted that his great quest has come to nothing. He apologizes to Alice for taking her on such a miserable vacation. They go for one last swim at the beach before walking off into the sunset, failing to notice Picasso, at the same beach with his family, standing a few hundred yards away, drawing fantastic figures in the sand.

The role of Sahrawi women was central already in pre-colonial and colonial life, but was strengthened further during the war years (1975‚Äì1991), when Sahrawi women ran most of the camps' administration, while the men were fighting at the front. This together with literacy- and professional education classes produced major advances in the role of women in Sahrawi society. The return of large numbers of Sahrawi men since the cease fire in 1991 may have slowed this development according to some observers, but women still run a majority of the camps' administration, and the Sahrawi women's union UNMS is very active in promoting their role. The role of women in camps was enhanced by their shouldering of the main responsibility for the camps and government bureaucracy during the war years, as virtually the entire male population was enrolled in the Polisario army. Politics In the 2012 election for seats in the Sahrawi National Council, 35% of the parliamentarians were women.

An American‚ÄìNew Zealand co- production, the film is set in a post-apocalyptic world where entire cities have been mounted on wheels and motorised, and practice municipal Darwinism; its movie universe is different from that of the books. Jackson purchased the rights to the book in 2009, but the film languished for several years before being officially announced in 2016. Jackson picked Rivers, who won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for his work on Jackson's King Kong, to make his feature-length directorial debut with the project, and also brought on several members of his production teams from the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit film series. Filming took place from April to July 2017 in New Zealand. Mortal Engines had its world premiere on November 27, 2018, in London, was theatrically released in Australia and New Zealand on December 6, 2018, and in the United States on December 14, 2018. The film received negative reviews from critics, some of whom praised the visual effects and score with most criticizing the direction, screenplay and \\"lack of personality\\". The film grossed over $83 million worldwide against a production budget of at least $100 million and post-production costs of nearly $150 million, losing the studio an estimated $174 million and making it the biggest box-office bomb of 2018, and the worst loss in cinematic history ($174.8 millions).https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2549326/artemis-fowl-and-9-other- ya-franchises-that-stumbled-out-of-the-gate Plot Following a cataclysmic conflict known as the Sixty Minute War, the remnants of humanity regroup and form mobile cities, called \\"Traction Cities\\". Under a philosophy known as \\"Municipal Darwinism\\", larger \\"predator\\" cities hunt and absorb smaller settlements in the \\"Great Hunting Ground\\", which includes Great Britain and Continental Europe. In opposition, settlements of the \\"Anti-Traction League\\" have developed an alternative civilization consisting of \\"static settlements\\" (traditional, non-mobile cities) in Asia led by Shan Guo (formerly China), protected by the \\"Shield Wall\\". Relics of 21st-century technology such as toasters, computers, and smartphones are valued by historians as \\"Old-Tech.\\" The city of London captures a small mining town called Salzhaken, absorbing its population and resources, under orders of Lord Mayor Magnus Crome. Tom Natsworthy, an apprentice historian, arrives at London's \\"Gut\\" to collect Salzhaken's Old-Tech for London's Museum. Hester Shaw, a masked twenty- something woman among the Salzhakens, attempts to assassinate Thaddeus Valentine, Head of the Guild of Historians, but Tom intervenes, pursuing Hester to a chute. Hester escapes, but not before telling him that Valentine murdered her mother and scarred her face. When Tom informs Valentine of this, he pushes Tom down the chute. Tom and Hester are forced to work together to traverse the Hunting Ground, surviving Southies, Scavs on a night hunt, and finding refuge in a vehicle called Scuttlebug, but the owners lock them in a cell, intending to sell them as slaves. Hester confides that Valentine killed her archaeologist mother Pandora after stealing a piece of Old-Tech she found in a dig in the Dead Continent of the Americas, whilst young Hester escaped with a necklace her mother gave her. Meanwhile, Valentine frees Shrike, a reanimated cyborg known as a \\"Stalker\\", from the offshore walking prison Sharkmoor, to find and kill Hester. At the slave market of Rustwater in the Outlands, Tom and Hester are rescued by Anti-Traction League agent Anna Fang. During the chaos, they are pursued by Shrike, whom Hester reveals she knows. Hester explains that Shrike had found and raised her after escaping Valentine, and Hester promised to let him turn her into a Stalker like himself, but she left after discovering that London had entered the Great Hunting Ground, giving her a chance to kill Valentine. In London, Valentine's good-natured daughter Katherine grows estranged from her father, especially after Apprentice Engineer Bevis Pod informs her that Valentine pushed Tom down the chute, and they learn Valentine's energy project in the re-purposed St Paul's Cathedral is more than it seems. Hester and Tom travel on Anna's airship, the Jenny Haniver, to the airborne city Airhaven, meeting other Anti-Traction League members. After questioning Hester, Tom realizes Pandora discovered a computer core for MEDUSA, a quantum energy-based superweapon used by the belligerents during the Sixty Minute War to instantly destroy entire cities, albeit shattering the Earth's crust into a thousand pieces that have rearranged the former continents. The Guild of Engineers have stolen the remaining components from Tom's museum workshop and built a MEDUSA under Valentine's orders. Shrike catches up with them, resulting in a fierce skirmish that critically wounds him and destroys Airhaven. Realizing that Hester is in love with Tom, he frees her of her promise before perishing. As Hester, Tom, and Anna travel to the Shield Wall with the surviving Anti- Tractionists, Valentine kills Crome in a coup and musters support from Londoners by vowing to destroy the Shield Wall with MEDUSA and lead them to a new Hunting Ground in Asia. Anna convinces Shan Guo Governor Kwan to launch the Anti-Tractionist airship fleet against London, but MEDUSA destroys the fleet and blasts a hole through the Shield Wall. After coming upon a stone carving of Medusa, Hester discovers that her mother's necklace hides a \\"crash drive\\", a kill switch for MEDUSA. Hester, Tom, Anna, and the remaining Anti- Tractionists lead a raid against London, braving the city's anti-aircraft guns. Hester and Anna infiltrate St Paul's, and though Valentine mortally wounds Anna during a sword duel, Hester destroys MEDUSA with the crash drive. In a last-ditch attempt to destroy the Shield Wall, the now insane Valentine has his henchmen kill the city's control crew and put the city on full throttle on a collision course with the Wall. With Katherine's help, Tom uses the Jenny Haniver to destroy London's engine. Hester catches and fights Valentine aboard his airship, where he reveals that he is her father. Tom rescues Hester and shoots down Valentine's ship, which is crushed by London's slowing tracks, killing Valentine. The surviving Londoners, now led by Katherine, make peace with the Anti-Tractionists, whilst Tom and Hester leave in the Haniver to see the world.

Release  Mortal Engines had its world premiere at the Empire, Leicester Square in London on November 27, 2018. It was released in New Zealand by Universal Pictures on December 7, 2018 and was then released in the United States on December 14, 2018, in 3D, Dolby Cinema, and IMAX 3D. = Box office = Mortal Engines grossed $16 million in the United States and Canada, and $67.7 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $83.7 million, against a production budget of at least $100 million.

After making just $2.8 million on its first day (including $675,000 from Thursday night previews), weekend estimates were lowered to $7 million. It went on to debut to $7.5 million, finishing fifth at the box office. The film fell 77% in its second weekend to $1.7 million, one of the largest drops for a wide release of all-time, and finished in 13th when Aquaman, Mary Poppins Returns, and Bumblebee were released during the Christmas holiday. Reception =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 26% based on 186 reviews, with an average rating of 4.91/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Mortal Engines has no shortage of eye-catching special effects, but lacks enough high-octane narrative fuel to give this futuristic fantasy sufficient cinematic combustion.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 44 out of 100, based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

While praising the film's emotional depth and Junkie XL's score, Barker compared Mortal Engines unfavorably to other science fiction films such as Cloud Atlas and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. New Zealand news website Stuff reviewer Graeme Tuckett awarded 4 out of 5, praising director Christian Rivers for the film's tone, pacing, choreography, sets, and costumes while noting the film's references to other series, including Star Wars, Mad Max, and The City of Lost Children.

David Fear of Rolling Stone described the film adaptation as \\"a steampunk Frankenstein's monster made from spare parts\\", giving it 2.5 out of 5. Glenn Kenny of RogerEbert.com awarded the film 1.5 out of 4, describing the film's story pacing as \\"laughably portentous and kitschy\\" and likened the film to another box-office bomb, the Wachowskis' Jupiter Ascending.

NBBC's mission is to reclaim, protect and celebrate the waterways.\\"Goings on About Town\\" The New Yorker, April 8, 2013 History The North Brooklyn Boat Club (NBBC) started in 2010 as a way to reconnect people to the waterways with the goal of recreation, education and environmental stewardship. NBBC is an open, volunteer-run organization consisting of kayakers, canoers, sailors, environmentalists, boat builders, community leaders and activists. NBBC was formally organized with the support of Greenpoint Waterfront Association for Parks and Planning (GWAPP) and many in the community as a way to increase access to open space and the waterways by securing funding for the Greenpoint Boathouse. =Greenpoint Community Boathouse and Environmental Education Center= A 2008 settlement over pollution fines by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection led the state of New York to create a $7 million fund for projects that would tangibly benefit the community affected by the pollution with a priority given to projects relating to the environment. NBBC proposed building one of the largest boathouses in the city along the shores of the Newtown Creek. The project aimed to enhance the community‚Äôs open space, educational and recreational facilities and improve the perception of the Newtown Creek. The idea was that awareness and stewardship are inextricably linked so a boathouse would best connect people to the waterways. The proposal received strong community support and garnered the approval of elected officials and organizations, including: Congresswoman Nydia Vel√°zquez, Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, State Assemblyman Joe Lentol, City Council Member Steve Levin, Open Space Alliance for North Brooklyn (OSA) and Neighbors Allied for Good Growth (NAG). In a combination of the public polling and feasibility ranking, the Boathouse project was selected as the top priority project for the funding. Based on the public support and strength of the proposal the Boathouse was chosen to be funded. The Boathouse was allocated $3 million from the state. The City Parks Foundation will oversee the spending and construction of the Boathouse. As of 2014, negotiations are being made for 6,500 square feet on Ash Street. =The Broadway Stages Boatyard= In the interim period before the construction of the Greenpoint Boathouse the members of NBBC searched for a location with which to access the water and held monthly meetings at the Brooklyn Rod & Club. Christine Holowacz, of GWAAP, introduced NBBC to Tony Argento, the owner of the film company Broadway Stages. Argento granted NBBC the 150-by-20-foot empty plot next to the Pulaski Bridge and Newtown Creek to create a boatyard. The Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance and many of the more established boat clubs in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Long Island City provided expertise and spare equipment. NBBC received a grant for infrastructure expenses from the Hudson River Foundation and donations of materials, such as steel storage containers, from local businesses and organizations including Allocco Recycling, Box House Hotel, Build It Green! NYC and TNT Scrap Metal to transform the empty lot to the Broadway Stages Boatyard. The storage containers were modified to serve as boat storage, an educational center, and boat building workshop. Local artist, Duke Riley, designed NBBC's logo. The Boatyard was further improved with the addition of floating docks obtained in partnership with Urban Swim. The Manhattan Solid Waste Advisory Board (SWAB) and Citizens Committee for New York City has provided NBBC a grant to improve its composting and gardening initiatives. NBBC is also collaborating with LaGuardia Community College on building an educational center on site called the Ed Shed and the Newtown Creek Alliance on research projects. The Ed Shed received additional funding for more environmental research equipment from a grant created by a legal settlement from the Greenpoint oil spill. The Ed Shed has become a center for teaching and researching the Newtown Creek ecosystem by students, researchers, and community members. The Boatyard has been recognized for being fun for families, dating and as one of the top places to boat in New York City. Common trips include Red Hook, Brooklyn Bridge Park, Bushwick Inlet, and Roosevelt Island. Several local businesses and musicians such as the New York Distilling Company, Brooklyn Brewery, Aura Sonic, Hungry March Band and Sasha Dobson have made donations to help NBBC host benefit concerts to continue its programming. Projects The North Brooklyn Boat Club has led many projects related to nearby bodies of water. It has hosted free public canoe trips on the East River and Newtown Creek; boat building and restoration, performed weekly water quality testing; performed mycoremediation on Newtown Creek in order to clean it up from pollutants; and formed a Newtown Creek Armada to clean the polluted Newtown Creek. The club has also participated in environmental activities, such as gardening and composting; creating an environmental education center (Ed Shed) hosting birdwatching tours; performed wildlife monitoring; created a Living Dock for local fauna; and balloon mapped (see Public Lab) in the area. The NBBC has hosted concerts and events like the Summer Solstice benefit concert; Rock the Pulaski benefit concert; film showings; the SHORE Feast; and SeaChange: We All Live Downstream. Beautification projects include the Newtown Nets (found objects) and the \\"Don‚Äôt Put Your Butt in the Creek\\" campaign to install cigarette disposal containers along the Newtown Creek.

Chartered in 1867, the railroad started construction in 1869 and cost $868,687.50. It opened October 8, 1872 and was subsequently leased to the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) from January 1, 1875 and in July of that year, PRR formed the Frederick Division to operate the rail line. In the spring of 1896, it was liquidated in a judicial sale to the PRR for 10 percent of its 1896 book value. Pennsylvania reorganized the railroad in December, 1896 as the Frederick and Northern Railroad Company. In March 1897, this new company was itself merged with other PRR-controlled railways, the Littlestown Railroad Company and the Hanover and York Railroad Company into the York, Hanover and Frederick Railroad, chartered under the general laws of Pennsylvania and Maryland. In 1914, this railroad and the newly built Central Railroad of Maryland were then merged into the York, Hanover and Frederick Railway Company which remained a wholly owned stock subsidiary of the PRR into the creation of the PennDel Company on December 31, 1953, and then the Penn Central Transportation Company merger in 1968 and then bankruptcy in 1970. The Frederick and Pennsylvania Line segment and other former PRR properties in Maryland were sold by Penn Central to the State of Maryland in 1982 for $9,295,000.Frederick County Land records, folio 1169, page 712 In 2006, the State sold approximately 20 miles of the branch to the Maryland Midland Railroad for approximately $300,000.Frederick County Land records, folio 5856, page 477 As of 2017, all but two miles () at the southern terminus at Frederick still exist, operated by either the Walkersville Southern Railroad or the Maryland Midland Railway. Chartering the railroad company In January, 1866, organizers met in Frederick to discuss chartering a railroad from the District of Columbia to the Pennsylvania State line through Frederick. This required a legislative act by the Maryland General Assembly to incorporate and charter the railroad. Without it, the group could not solicit stock, purchase property through condemnation, or obtain financial backing in the form of stock subscriptions or bond sales from either the city or the County of Frederick. In March 1867 the Maryland General Assembly passed an Act to incorporate the Frederick and Pennsylvania line railroad. an Act to incorporate the Frederick and Pennsylvania line (F&PL;) Railroad Company (Accessed from Maryland State Archives) One of those senators voting to incorporate the railroad was its future president, Charles Edward Trail of Frederick. Volume 133, Page 694 The F&PL; was authorized to raise $1 million ($=), in capital (at $50 per share, US$s, 1867) to construct a railroad of one or more sets of tracks (within a right of way of less than one hundred feet () in width) from Frederick, Maryland, through Frederick and Carroll counties to the Maryland and Pennsylvania line, in the direction of Littlestown, Pennsylvania. The charter also required the road to make connections with the Western Maryland Railroad but made no specific references to requiring the railroad to serve any of towns along the line such as Walkersville or Woodsboro. The charter further required the line to commence construction by March 1870 (three years from passage) and be completed within ten years or be dissolved. :(see also The full text of the corporation charter as well as General Regulation applicable to all railroads incorporated in the State of Maryland prior to 1872.) In August 1868, the company was organized with John Loats elected as the first president of the railroad. This organizational effort required additional legislation. In 1868, John A. Lynch, John Sifford, and 356 others, citizens of Frederick, requested legislation to authorize the corporate authorities of Frederick to subscribe to the capital stock of the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line Rail Road, and to levy taxes on said city for such purpose. A similar measure was requested to authorize Frederick County to subscribe to the capital stock and endorse the mortgage bonds of four railroads, the Western Maryland Rail Road Company, the Frederick and Emmittsburg Rail Road Company, the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line Rail Road Company, and the Frederick and Williamsport Rail Road Company. On March 30, 1868, the Governor signed a bill authorizing the Mayor, Aldermen and Common Council of Frederick to subscribe to as much as $250,000 ($=) of Frederick and Pennsylvania Line Railroad Company stock and bonds subject to a vote approving such subscription. Frederick would issue its own debt to pay for the railroad capital and pay the bonds off with taxation on the real and personal property of Frederick. On May 4, 1868, the city had an election seeking approval which passed 797 to 80. The Frederick and Pennsylvania Line Railroad Company's incorporation act was modified a second time in 1870 by the Maryland General Assembly to authorize it to build a rail line south from Frederick, its then authorized terminus through Frederick and Montgomery Counties, and on to the boundary of the District of Columbia, so as to make a direct connection with the city of Washington. The F&PL; was authorized to connect with or cross over any railway in Frederick or Montgomery counties as well as construct one or more branches, none of which could exceed in length. The railroad was authorized to build a right of way in width, modified as necessary for cuts and fills. The company was authorized to issue another $3 million ($=) in stock or bonds for this purpose. The extension had to be commenced within five years (1875) and at least one set of tracks completed by 1880. This target schedule for starting construction was revised in 1874 to 1876 and complete one track by 1882, but the railroad was never extended south of its 1872 terminus. In April 1872 the state legislature revised Frederick's charter to allow any railroad in the city such as either the Baltimore and Ohio, or the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line to construct track on any of the city's streets, lanes, or alleys. Although the right of way for the track had been granted through Frederick, the railroad then had to negotiate with the connecting railroad (Baltimore and Ohio Railroad). In 1874 F&PL; was authorized by the Maryland General Assembly to lease its railroad to any party or group of persons it saw fit, subject to the assent of a stockholder majority. Legislation was passed allowing Frederick county to purchase stock of any turnpike built or starting construction after 1868. In 1878, the railroad issued preferred stock which if issued must pay a perpetual dividend of six per cent, per annum out of the profits of said company. In 1882, the railroad was ordered not to obstruct any streets in Taneytown, longer than five minutes nor to allow any of its engines to stop longer than five minutes noting in the law's preamble that a great inconvenience has been suffered by the citizens of Taneytown and vicinity. (Session Laws, 1882 Special Session) Two years later, the railroad is ordered to station a flagman or a signalman by day and by night, at the crossing over the Frederick and Woodsboro turnpike, near Frederick, in Frederick County. Volume 390, Page 1201 Engineering the railroad In the period just after the American Civil War, engineering a railroad consisted of locating the route, choosing locations for structures and their size and then contracting for the work. (See article on construction contracting) =Route location= The first step in locating a route is to establish the class of the road (Main line or branch line), the terminals and perhaps one or more intermediate points such as crossings or stations, etc. The road's organizers had promoted the preferable route as being terminated in Frederick and then proceeding north crossing the Monocacy river through Israel's Creek and into Pennsylvania using Piney Creek, which heads near Littlestown, offering a valley route almost the entire distance. Railroad topography can be broadly classed into three types: *(1) level prairie country offering no obstacles in the way of hills, valleys, etc., and allowing the locating engineer much latitude in the placing of his line, and consequently reducing distance and curvature to a minimum; *(2) rolling, hilly country through which several lines are possible, none of them departing to any great extent from the direct line between controlling points; and *(3) mountainous country, which taxes the skill and ingenuity of the locating engineer to the utmost. The railroad was promoted as a route of the second type and was almost an \\"air line\\". Reconnaissance and Preliminary Survey Cover page for 1867 Gitt survey for Frederick and Pennsylvania Line RR In 1867, Joseph Gitt and P.H. Irwin located a route for the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line Railroad. Unlike the 1865 survey for the Western Maryland, Gitt made a much shorter reconnaissance in the field on horseback for the proposed road and did not supplement that information with instrumental surveys. The major feature of Gitt's proposed route was that from Woodsboro south into Frederick, it was located between the Woodsboro and Frederick Turnpike, now Maryland Route 194 and Israel Creek. Aside from diverting in Walkersville, the road continued south along the eastern side of the turnpike,crossing over at the toll house and crossing the Monocacy just north of what is today Route 194 at Ceresville, Md.. The first route south of Walkersville terminated opposite the Court House, at Church Street, in Frederick, Md. on the west side. (The Frederick branch line was on the east side.) Gitt and Irwin conducted a second survey, this time starting in Frederick at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) depot at South Street in downtown Frederick, Maryland on the east end heading north out to intercept the line established by their first survey at Worman's Mill and intercept the first line near the river crossing. Gitt recommended a truss bridge crossing for the Monocacy river with an elevation of 30 feet, and two spans of 150 feet each with no references to any wooden trestle work on the north shore of any length or masonry foundations. Bridges were also required for Big Pipe Creek with an elevation of 50 feet, and span of 150 feet; Little Pipe Creek with an elevation of 58 feet, and span of also 150 feet with no references to any wooden trestle work on the south‚Äìnorth shore of any length or masonry foundations. Gitt developed the cost estimate for the road assuming single track operation, iron rail at 50 pounds per yard,ties on 24 inch centers, a road bed base fourteen foot in width, with slopes of one foot horizontal to each vertical for cuts and twelve foot in width for embankments with slopes of one foot and-a-half horizontal to each vertical, no excavation deeper than 25 feet or embankments over 30 feet. As in his Western Maryland work, the cost for right of way was not included in Gitt's estimate. The ruling grade for Gitt's proposed route was 52.8 feet to the mile, or 1% and no curve was shorter than 1,000 feet. The highest point on the line between Littlestown and Frederick at 520 feet was one mile west of Ladiesburg, Maryland while the lowest point on the line at 281 feet was at the Frederick station. (Data from 1953 USGS topo maps) At the end of their survey, Gitt and Irwin estimated that their proposed 30 mile alignment could be shortened by a half-mile with more careful work, or 29.5 miles. Gitt estimated that the cost of constructing the railroad, independent of right of way, was $604,752 ($= at today's prices) approximately $20,000 ($=) per mile or $ ($=) per kilometer. The advantage for the road was cutting the distance to the rail center at York, Pennsylvania by . The distance from Hanover Junction to Frederick was less than through the Frederick branch. The grades at no point on the proposed route exceeded sixty feet to the mile (%). Crucially, Gitt estimated the potential revenue for the road at $103,000 per year ($=) of which $10,000 was from passenger traffic. Final Location and Construction Survey Although Gitt surveyed a route in 1867, the railroad solicited proposals for final engineering and route location in late 1868 and in October of that year, the Board received separate proposals from Gitt and Irwin as well as its future chief engineer John A. Haydon. The Board minutes show that Haydon's proposal was selected for its detail. In December of that year, the railroad purchased survey instruments from the firm of Frederick W. King (1821 - 1889) and Richard King (1823 - 1905) Baltimore, Maryland. Haydon commenced work on the railroad in May 1869 (Ibid.) with fellow civil engineer Calvin L Fulton (1837-1911) as his assistant.Ashcroft's official railway directory.1870, page 97. Accessed on June 3, 2018. [New York]. In the following year (1869), at its June 2 meeting, the Board directed road engineer Haydon to resurvey road location from Littlestown to the state line. Haydon completed his resurvey and in December,1869 the Board approved relocating the line from Gitt's alignment along Israel Creek (the east-side route) through Woodsboro, Walkersville and into Frederick to Haydon's west-side alignment along Glade Creek. The Board ordered a review on the Harmony Grove segment in the Spring of 1870, but by the fall of 1870, Haydon's resurvey was complete and on September 27, 1870: Haydon presented his report on the west and east line location study with the east line in Frederick connecting with the B&O; being adopted. When construction was completed two years later, the road's total length had been shortened another mile to 28.5 miles. A number of changes had been made: :Heading north, the final alignment started on the east-side, going up east street in Frederick, Maryland in a direct line to Harmony Grove (west of Gitt's line) at an elevation of 315 feet and two miles. As constructed the line distance to The Monocacy river was milepost 3.75 miles, while Gitt's line called for crossing The Monocacy river at milepost 4.0; 1.5 miles to the southwest. :Beyond the Monocacy and up to Woodsboro, the road was aligned to the east slope of Glade creek whereas Gitt had placed the road on the western slope of Israel creek. :The road had 45 curves, one of 9 degrees in Frederick Md and the others at 5 degrees or less. Unlike Gitt's 1% grade, the largest grade was 1.44% also in Frederick. :The railroad was built with 56lb iron rail, not the 50 recommended by Gitt. 1916 ICC photograph of FPL Frederick Water tower, looking north. On June 12, 1872, Brevet Col, John A. Haydon was paid for completing the road in cash ($800), shares (4 shares) and second mortgage bonds. Other Engineering *The elements of engineering required for the final route location included bridges: Tuscarora Creek bridge Monocacy river bridge and viaduct Big Pipe Creek and Little Pipe Creek, near Keymar each of which required a bridge and viaduct. A bridge crossing for the Western Maryland Railroad at Keymar, Maryland along with facilities and connecting track. Piney Creek bridge *Numerous culverts, cuts, and embankments *Construction of two water tanks, one at Keymar, Maryland and the other at Frederick, Maryland. *Station facilities *Terminal facilities at Frederick, inclusive of the engine house and passenger stations. The rolling stock consisted of two locomotives, one sixty passenger wooden coach, fifteen house and gondola cars and a sufficient number of truck, dump and hand cars for the service of the road, the aggregate cost of which was $12,186 ($=). The article states that the C. Burr Artz Library received information in April 1945, relative to establishing the railroad and nothing more. Constructing the railroad Newspaper announcement that construction started at the State line between Maryland and Pennsylvania in 1870. On July 29, 1869, the railroad celebrated the start of construction near Woodsboro, Maryland roasting an Ox whole in barbecue style. The time required to award contracts for construction delayed the actual start of construction until the following January 15, 1870 with completion anticipated for June 1871. The March 5th paper, page 279 gave the report of the June 1871 completion. This was only weeks ahead of the 1867 charter requirement to commence construction by March 1870 or be dissolved. Later that year, the railroad advertised for proposals for the bridge masonry for the two Pipe Creek Bridges. :In July,1870, the \\"...troubles of the company in relation to money have been overcome, and no further trouble is anticipated on that subject.\\" Example of a piece of iron rail manufactured in 1872 by the Baltimore and Ohio railroad In December 1870, the railroad awarded a contract to Lochiel Iron Company of Pennsylvania for the iron rails to lay the railroad. Littlestown Press reported in an interview with A. W. Eichelberger, President of the Hanover Branch railroad and a director of the F&PL; railroad that the iron rails for the road had been purchased and would be laid to Taneytown by January, 1871. The remainder of the iron rail for the road into Frederick would be purchased in March 1872.March 9th, Loats is authorized to purchase the remaining iron rail for the road into Frederick City. During 1871, construction had progressed to the point where the road bed throughout the three divisions was practically completed including work in Frederick itself in Biser's field north end of Love Lane or East Street.July 7, 1871 Track-laying of the iron rail purchased from Lochiel had been carried from the State line to Little Pipe Creek eleven miles. Wendel Bollman's company Patapsco Bridge and Iron Works of Baltimore was awarded contracts for the Tuscarora and Monocacy River bridges as well as the viaducts over Little and Big Pipe creeks and by the end of 1871, Big Pipe creek was erected. These bridges were to be \\"Bollman suspension truss\\" a design patented by Bollman in 1852. Similar to the Savage Mill Trail bridge with two 80 foot spans and the Harper's ferry bridges, the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line truss structures were to be a mixture of wrought iron tension members and cast iron compression members,including other decorative elements, such as Doric styled vertical members and end towers, all cast iron and detailed. Bollman built about a hundred of these bridges through 1873 and these bridges at spans of 150 and 60 feet above water would be some of the last and largest bridges built by Bollman using his patent. Going into 1872, the railroad had five turnouts (switches), 3 miles of iron rail and 27,000 cross ties on hand for the work that year, but overall, progress on the road had been slowed for ..\\"want of labor\\". However, during that period, the first train passed in January, from Littlestown to the banks of Big Pipe Creek, a distance of fourteen miles and within a mile of the Western Maryland railroad, which interchange was to be completed by February. This completed connections with the PRR-controlled Hanover and Littlestown railroads as well as the Western Maryland, allowing the Pennsylvania Company to run their engines over the road bringing in all the iron from the North Central (Littlestown) and Hanover branch. In April, Patapsco Bridge and Iron Works completed the bridge and viaducts over Little Pipe Creek, a total length of 705 feet, the deck of the bridge with a span of 135 feet, 60 feet above low water; trestling consisting of 19 spans, eleven on the Frederick and eight on the Carroll county side of the creek was made of rolled iron plates, forming six angular tubular columns \\"securely riveted together, and apparently of great strength\\".Bridge located in the meadow lands of Samuel and Frank McGinnis Over the next several months, trackwork proceeded south from big pipe creek through Bruceville (now known as Keymar), then on to Woodsboro, and then in August, 1872 trackwork had been completed through Woodsboro and onto towards Walkersville, then at a point 3 miles south of Woodsboro. On September 28, 1872 the track was finished as far as the north side of 8th or North Street at the head of Love Lane or East Street in Frederick. Local citizens were offered rides on the newly completed line, noting the good substantial bridges over the Monocacy & Tuscorora built of iron. :\\"As they were nearly there yesterday, I went out to see them yesterday afternoon & Mr. Loats the president of the road invited Jacob Engelbrecht to take a ride in the train (hauling materials) which was just ready to start. Went to the Walkersville and Georgetown Depot (in contemplation) and tarried an hour or more & returned about 4¬Ω PM (Left about 2 PM) Nice road and good substantial bridges over the Monocacy & Tuscorora built of iron by Wendell Bollman Esquire of Baltimore. Passenger cars will run next week.\\"(Jacob Engelbrecht) The line was completed and ready for revenue service and on September 29, 1872, the first regular passenger train left Frederick (corner of East & Eighth Street) for Westminster (where they now have the Carroll County Cattle Show) with a round trip fare costing $1.35 ($=). At that time, no connection had been made with the B&O; railroad to the south and no station had been built in Frederick but a local citizen wished the road success because it had been met with great opposition.September 29, 1872 Revenue Service Years = Hanover Branch Railroad Management (June 1872-March 1873) = In June 1872, the Hanover and York Railroad Company also known as Hanover Branch Railroad reported as part of its annual report to stockholders that it would be providing operations assistance to the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line, Littlestown Railroad and the Bachman Valley Railroad. The Frederick and Pennsylvania Line itself was completed and ready for revenue service by the Hanover and York Railroad Company on September 29, 1872. The first regular passenger train left Frederick (corner of East & Eighth Street) for Westminster on September 29, 1872 with a round trip fare costing $1.35 ($=). At that time, no connection had been made with the B&O; railroad to the south and no station had been built in Frederick but a local citizen wished the road success because it had been met with great opposition. On October 7, 1872, the Board approved seven manned stations with annual compensation for its agents at $750 per year ($=). :David M. Scholl at Georgetown/Walkersville :Shank at Woodsboro :Issac Renner at New Midway :Samuel Birchey at Ladiesburg :U. Heiltabidle at Loat's Junction :Dr. Rinedollar at Taneytown :Shue at Shue's station. The following May, the railroad had regularly scheduled passenger service (two trains a day) between Frederick and the Western Maryland connection in Bruceville, Maryland and in Littlestown for connections north. By July, 1872, the railroad directly connected with the B&O; trackage on the Frederick branch at Pyfer's coal yard, lower depot.July 22, 1873 = Frederick and Pennsylvania Line Management (March 1873 - January 1, 1875) = Label for Board of Directors' Minutes Book for the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line RR In 1868 at the August 10th meeting control of the company was formally handed over to the newly elected directors from the commissioners as required by the charter with John Loats elected president. On February 13, 1872, Charles Trail would be elected president and serve in that capacity until the roads demise twenty-four years later. While Gitt had estimated that the road would produce over $100,000 as year in revenue, by September 15, 1873 (With revenue operations of almost a year) the Board heard a committee report that found that the cause of lower than expected freight revenue was due to a lack of freight sidings, switches and facilities such as public team tracks. On March 31, 1874, Board authorizes a statement that it is unable to pay interest on the first mortgage series due to winter damages and a lack of aid from the city and county. Still, the railroad had impacted travel in the county. An example was the October, 1874 Frederick County Cattle Show which had more attendance than at any former year with attendance estimated at 8 or 10 thousand persons. One reason was the railroads reduced their fare to one half. Governor William Bigler of Pennsylvania delivered an address on the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia to be held in 1876. Governor Bradford of Maryland was also there. A local observer noted that the town was ...\\"as lively as Broadway in New York.\\"October 13, 1874 The losses continued to mount however and in December 1874, the Board approved leasing the railroad to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company = Pennsylvania Railroad Management (January 1, 1875 - November 20, 1896) = Full text copy of the Pennsylvania Railroad Lease of the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line RR from Director's minute book On January 1, 1875, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company leased the Frederick & Pennsylvania and the Littlestown Railroads. It also leased the Hanover & York Railroad, effective July 5, 1875, the three roads having a total length of 55.5 miles, and extending the Pennsylvania Railroad from York, Pennsylvania to Frederick, Maryland. They were to be operated at cost and compensation for the use of their equipment. That same year on July 1, the Pennsylvania established the Frederick Division with the York Branch and the Columbia Bridge, formerly operated as a portion of the Philadelphia Division, being transferred to, thus making that Division extend from Columbia to Frederick, a distance of 69.5 miles. The earnings that first year were $33,000. In early 1876, the Pennsylvania Railroad made plans for a depot in Frederick, purchasing the following real property fronting on East Street (or Love Lane) between Church & Second Streets: :House & lot from Michael Lotz for $2000. :House & lot from Mrs. Lightner for $900. :House & lot from Mr. George K.Birely for $1800. :House & lot from Frederick Wertheimer for $1000. :House & Lot from George W. Cramer for $300. :(the old Justus Gerecht Property) for $604. :House & lot around the corner on Second Street from A. Sheffield for $1900. :House & lot on same street from Mrs. Buckels for $2000. :House & lot on same street from Mrs. Smith for $2000.January 6, 1876: Pennsylvania Railroad Depot for Frederick city:Sold January 3, 1876. Total $12,504. Going into 1896, the year of its bankruptcy and sale, the railroad still only had two scheduled trains a day northbound to Philadelphia coming out of Frederick going through Walkersville and Woodsboro with five trains out of York, Pennsylvania; travel time from Frederick to Walkersville was 16 minutes and 27 minutes to Woodsboro. No other station stops besides these. The morning mail run left Frederick at 9am. The stockholders meeting was publicized for February 28, 1896 in Baltimore at the Northern Central RR offices. Eleven directors were slated to be elected with five of those being the Frederick Mayor and Alderman. Trail was again, re-elected president; Stephen White, who was not only secretary to the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line, but a number of other PRR controlled railroads including the Northern Central and A. W. Hendrix as treasurer who like White served in similar positions to other PRR controlled railroads. Also attending this meeting was Mayor Aquilla R. Yeakle of Frederick as a member of the Board. PRR internal memo describing Frederick and Pennsylvania Line RR losses after judicial sale in 1896 The following month in March, newspapers reported that the railroad was being sold. On June 10, a public auction ordered by the circuit court was held at the Frederick county court house. With little attendance and no other bidders present, in nine minutes, the road was sold to George Massey,a lawyer for the Pennsylvania Railroad for $150,000. The sale was for property only as at that time the road owned no rolling stock. Aside from its initial purchase of equipment in 1872, all equipment had been provided through either an earlier agreement with the Hanover railroad, or the later PRR lease.The article mentions the loss sustained by the City and county in this sale but gives no details on what forced the sale. The following year in January, 1897 again in Baltimore, the railroad was reorganized into the Frederick and Northern Railroad Company. At that time, it was reported that the predecessor line was barely able to cover operating expenses and rarely turned a profit. It never earned the interest payable on its bonds, (Frederick was the largest bondholder) and at the time of its foreclosure, the unpaid interest exceeded the principal. = York, Hanover and Frederick railway (YH&F;) 1897-1953 = York Hanover and Frederick railway system map in 1918 In March 1897, this new company was itself merged with other Pennsylvania-controlled railways (Littlestown Railroad Company and the Hanover and York Railroad Company) into the York, Hanover and Frederick Railroad Company, chartered under the general laws of Pennsylvania and Maryland.

Unsatisfied with Western Maryland's freight tariffs, Tidewater approached the York, Hanover and Frederick Railroad in order to secure an extension to its plant, a distance of 5.146 miles.Public Service Commission of Maryland,(1911). Report. Baltimore. Accessed at The PRR's Frederick Branch,The Keystone, Pennsylvania Railroad Technical & Historical Society, 2000, Vol.33, No.1 As an incentive to build the spur, Tidewater agreed to guarantee a minimum shipment of 500,000 tons of cement over the line. In 1914, this newly built Central Railroad of Maryland was merged into the York, Hanover and Frederick Railway Company and renamed as the Union Bridge branch. The branch was abandoned in 1971 and track removed in 1972. The York, Hanover and Frederick Railway remained a wholly owned stock subsidiary of the PRR into the creation of the PennDel company on December 31, 1953 and then the Penn Central merger in 1968 and then bankruptcy in 1970. =Maryland Department of Transportation= The Frederick and Pennsylvania Line segment was transferred to the State of Maryland for use by the Maryland Department of Transportation in 1982 for $9.2 million. In 2006, the State transferred title to the Maryland Midland Railway for the following: :\\"real property, railroad track and appurtenant railroad facilities comprising portions of the lines of railroad known as the Western Maryland Railroad Company's former Highfield-Glyndon Line and Penn Central's Littlestown to Frederick Line. The portion of the former Penn Central Littlestown to Frederick Line subject to the PSA consists of approximately 20.25 miles of the railroad right-of-way beginning at valuation station 2091+56 (Mile Post 39) in Littlestown,(Pennsylvania), proceeding southwesterly to just north of North Glade Road, north of Walkersville,(Maryland)...\\" The Surface Transportation Board (STB) website has all of the following documents available on this matter.

G. Quintel, originally aired on Cartoon Network in the United States. Quintel originally created the series' pilot using characters from his comedy shorts for the cancelled anthology series The Cartoonstitute. He developed Regular Show from his own experiences in college, while several of its main characters originated from his animated shorts The Na√Øve Man from Lolliland and 2 in the AM PM. Following the success of its fourth season, Regular Show was renewed for a fifth season on November 1, 2012. The season ran from September 2, 2013 to August 14, 2014. Regular Shows fifth season was storyboarded and written by Calvin Wong, Toby Jones, Andres Salaff (who left to become a supervising director on Adventure Time), Madeline Queripel, Benton Connor, Hilary Florido (who moved on following this season to work on Steven Universe), Sarah Oleksyk (currently storyboard director for Sanjay and Craig), Minty Lewis, Ryan Pequin and Owen Dennis. The writers for this season were J. G. Quintel, Mike Roth, John Infantino, Sean Szeles, Michele Cavin, and Matt Price, who is also the story editor, while being produced by Cartoon Network Studios. The season aired with the first episodes, \\"Laundry Woes\\" and \\"Silver Dude\\". This season contains a half-hour Halloween special entitled \\"Terror Tales of the Park III\\" that aired on October 21, 2013, a half-hour Thanksgiving episode titled \\"The Thanksgiving Special\\" that aired on November 25, 2013, and a half-hour special based on the character Skips named \\"Skips' Story\\" that aired on April 14, 2014. Development =Concept= Two 23-year-old friends, a blue jay named Mordecai and a raccoon named Rigby, are employed as groundskeepers at a park and spend their days trying to slack off and entertain themselves by any means. This is much to the chagrin of their boss Benson and their coworker, Skips, but to the delight of Pops. Their other coworkers, Muscle Man (an overweight green man) and High Five Ghost (a ghost with a hand extending from the top of his head), serve as rivals to Mordecai and Rigby. The show usually revolves around Mordecai and Rigby's attempts to avoid work and enjoy themselves. However, they often, at times, have to pay for their irresponsible actions, as they always get into more trouble than they thought. This typically results in Mordecai and Rigby going through bizarre and surrealistic misadventures, many of which nearly kill them or others around them. =Production= Many of the characters are loosely based on those developed for Quintel's student films at California Institute of the Arts: The Naive Man From Lolliland and 2 in the AM PM.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56STDM667ds Quintel pitched Regular Show for Cartoon Network's Cartoonstitute project, in which the network allowed young artists to create pilots with no notes to possibly be optioned as a show. After being green-lit, Quintel recruited several indie comic book artists to compose the staff of the show, as their style matched close to what he desired for the series. The season was storyboarded and written by Calvin Wong, Toby Jones, Andres Salaff (who left to become a supervising director on Adventure Time), Madeline Queripel, Benton Connor, Hilary Florido (who moved on following this season to work on Steven Universe), Sarah Oleksyk (currently storyboard director for Sanjay and Craig), Minty Lewis, Ryan Pequin and Owen Dennis. The writers for this season were J. G. Quintel, Mike Roth, John Infantino, Sean Szeles, Michele Cavin, and Matt Price, who is also the story editor, while being produced by Cartoon Network Studios. The fifth season of Regular Show was produced October 2012 ‚Äì August 2013 with heavy use of double entendres and mild language. Quintel stated that, although the network wanted to step up from the more child-oriented fare, there were some restrictions that came along with this switch.

The book was written by Trofim Kichko, who worked at the Academy, who had past associations with Nazi Germany. The book argued that a worldwide Jewish conspiracy existed, that the Jewish people were attempting to subvert the Soviet Union, and had played a role in the 1941 Nazi-German invasion of the country. The book was illustrated throughout with caricatures depicting Jewish people in a stereotypical and prejudicial manner, very similar to those that had been seen in Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda. While the work was initially hailed as scientific work of distinction in analyzing the Jewish population of the Soviet Union and distributed for educational purposes across the nation, it was met with hostility from the international community. The work was condemned across Europe and the United States, leading to protests in Scandinavia when General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev toured the region. Communist parties in Europe and America also attacked the work and called for the Soviet government to withdraw its support for the work, and it from circulation. Under intense international pressure the Soviet government withdrew its support, and destroyed all copies. As a result, Kichko fell out of favor with the government. Although the book was destroyed, similar works continued to be published and several years later Kichko - having returned to grace - published a second anti-Semitic work. Historians agree that Kichko was working under instructions of the central government, and that his work was the beginning of a new wave of government- sponsored anti-Semitism within the larger structure of the Soviet Union's attack on religion. Furthermore, historians see the work as a Soviet attempt to cause friction between its Jewish and Ukrainian populations, which backfired. Background Under the rule of Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union exploited earlier traditions of anti-Semitism that existed in its territories. Official policy deemed Jews to be foreign and traitorous elements. During the Great Purge of the 1930s, leading Jewish figures and institutions were targeted. Between 1948 and 1953, anti-Semitism became official state policy. The murder of Solomon Mikhoels, the director of the Moscow State Jewish Theater, was the start of a wave of anti-Semitism that aimed to destroy \\"all the Jewish cultural institutions that were left from the 1930s or that had been established during\\" the Second World War. Following the death of Stalin, anti-Semitism waned allowing the Jewish population to live in fear no longer. However, anti-Semitism remained \\"invariably linked to the ideological and political concerns of the Kremlin and enjoyed strong roots in popular attitudes and behavior.\\" From the mid-1950s onwards, a new wave of anti- Semitism permeated the Soviet Union inspired by Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. This was further enhanced by Khrushchev's campaign against religion. The attack on Judaism, unlike those against other religions, \\"took on an antisemitic dimension.\\" Soviet propaganda began to push the idea that Jewish people venerated capitalism and promoted the economic exploitation of non- Jewish people. Between 1959 and 1964, 1,847 anti-religious publications were printed. While only eight percent were focused solely on attacking Judaism, the vast majority included some form of attack. \\"The proportion of anti- Judaism titles was ... seven times larger than the proportion of Jews\\" in the Soviet Union. This was exacerbated by the number of copies of anti-Jewish work in circulation. On average 27,000 copies of any single piece of anti-Christian material were printed and 6,000 copies of anti-Islamic material, compared to the 46,000 copies of anti-Jewish publications. This amounted to 2.5 million anti-Jewish publications in print between 1959 and 1964. By the early 1960s, 85 percent of synagogues had been closed. No Yiddish schools were permitted within Russia, nor did any institutions within the Soviet Union provide courses in Yiddish, Hebrew or Jewish history. Of the 110 death sentences promulgated during that period for economic crimes, over 70 of them were imposed on Jewish defendants. Content In October 1963, the Kiev-based Ukrainian Academy of Sciences published an initial batch of 12,000 copies of Judaism without Embellishment. This work was written by Trofim Kichko, a former Nazi German collaborator during the Second World War, a member of the Communist Party and a prot√©g√© of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. His work was \\"a reworking of the turn-of-the-century tsarist police hoax known as Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\". Kichko's work argued for \\"the existence of a universal Jewish conspiracy involving Judaism, Jewish bankers, Zionism, and Western capitalism\\". The Jewish population were depicted as being reactionary and subversive, all of which was based on a religious belief in \\"virtually every ... unattractive moral quality\\". The text was supported throughout by \\"galling ... caricatures ... which [were] reminiscent of Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda\\", the likes of which had been seen in the official Nazi party newspaper Der St√ºrmer (\\"the most viciously anti-Jewish Nazi publication\\"). The image on the book cover was of a \\"hooked-nose rabbinical figure, standing at his pulpit with a sack of overflowing gold coins in his clawlike hands.\\" While the work was similar to earlier literary attacks on Jews, Kichko went further, arguing that the German-led attack on the Soviet Union begun on June 22, 1941 was a joint affair between the Jewish people and Nazi Germany. Reaction Within the Soviet Union, Judaism Without Embellishment was widely praised as a \\"scientific work of distinction\\". Izvestia, the official newspaper of the Soviet government, praised Kichko's work for \\"us[ing] new material in analyzing the reactionary nature of Judaism as a form of religious ideology.\\" The work was extensively republished across the nation, and was \\"widely distributed ... among party cadres and educators.\\" On 24 February 1964, Morris B. Abram, the president of the American Jewish Committee, supported by a United States representative to the United Nations' Commission on Human Rights, brought Kichko's work to worldwide attention by attacking the book during a press conference. Shortly afterwards, international criticism was leveled at Kichko and his book. Communist parties worldwide condemned the work. The French communist newspaper L'Humanit√© denounced the book and demanded that the Soviet Union disavow the work. Gus Hall, the secretary- general of the United States Communist Party, stated, \\"[T]here is no doubt in my mind about the anti-Semitic character of what I have seen. Such stereotyped, slanderous caricatures of the Jewish people must be unequivocally condemned.\\" To exploit this discontent with the Soviet Union, the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had the book translated into French to be distributed to left-wing groups across Europe. When Khrushchev toured Scandinavia in the spring of 1964, demonstrations took place against the USSR's treatment of Jews, motivated in part by the publication of Judaism without Embellishment. In the Ukraine, reaction to the book was also negative. Ukrainian nationalist Mykola Lebed saw the book \\"as a Soviet attempt to paint Ukrainians with a broad anti-Semitic brush\\". This resulted in Ukrainians, especially among the former supports of Stepan Bandera, switching from using anti-Semitism as a weapon to use against the Soviet authorities to attacking the Soviet government for being anti-Semitic. Caving to international pressure, the Soviet government abandoned support for the book. On 4 April 1964, the Russian newspaper Pravda - the newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party - announced an official change in policy. The statement read, \\"The author of the book and the authors of the preface wrongly interpreted some questions concerning the emergence and development of this religion. ... [A] number of mistaken propositions and illustrations could insult the feelings of believers and might even be interpreted in the spirit of anti-Semitism.\\" The paper continued \\"There is no such thing as anti-Semitism in the USSR and cannot be.\\" The Soviet Communist Party's ideological committee withdrew the work from circulation and destroyed all copies. As a result, Kichko fell out of favor and \\"temporarily sank into obscurity.\\" Aftermath Despite the withdrawal of Kichko's work, it was soon replaced by similar works by other authors. On 4 October 1967, an article by Kichko was published in Komsomolskoye Znamya, a provincial newspaper in the Ukraine. On 20 January 1968, Pravda Ukrainy, the central newspaper of the Ukraine, \\"reported that Kichko was being rewarded with a scroll of honor for his 'services to atheist propaganda'\\". This was followed by the publication of his second work: Judaism and Zionism, an anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli work that reiterated the hoax of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy. Analysis Journalist Leonid Vladimirov asserted that information gleaned from friends in Kiev suggested that Kichko was able to overcome his background and rise to a position of authority within the Ukrainian scientific community owing to his devotion to anti-Semitic research. Vladimirov commented that \\"there are services in Russia for which even collaborators are pardoned\\". Maurice Friedberg states that the publication of Judaism without Embellishment was \\"a precursor of the resurgence of officially sponsored anti-Semitism\\". Commentators are unanimous in their understanding of why Judaism without Embellishment was published. Stefan T. Possony asserts that Kichko \\"was ordered to write\\" his book and \\"his fabrications were ordered to be published in the Ukrainian language\\" with the aim of embroiling \\"the Jews with the Ukrainians once again.\\" The Canadian- Ukrainian historians Ivan Katchanovski, Zenon E. Kohut, Bohdan Y. Nebesio and Myroslav Yurkevich are all in agreement. They argue that in an effort \\"to discredit Ukrainian nationalism\\", the Soviet government was attempting to \\"associate Soviet Ukrainian institutions with anti-Semitic publications\\", and that the best-known example of this was Kichko's work. Amir Weiner argues along similar lines, stating that Kichko's work was not an \\"accidental slip\\", as evidenced by the \\"belated Soviet reaction\\".

Swami Paramananda, a disciple of Swami Vivekananda, founded the Vedanta centres in Los Angeles and Boston. Hindu temples have emerged in the US in the urban areas in the same manner as in India. Los Angeles has witnessed the building of new temples in its suburbs, as the result of a significant community of Hindus living in Los Angeles County and the surrounding counties. The Los Angeles Hindu Society is based at the Pasadena Hindu Temple, which claims to \\"promote the religious, social and cultural activities and the spiritual well being of the Hindu community in the U.S. state of California. History =Background= The earliest history of awareness of Hinduism in the United States was in the early nineteenth century through the translated books of Bhagavad Gita from the Sanskrit text of the Hindus, which were very well received by noted scholars like Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson in the field of transcendentalism. This was followed by the visit of P. C. Mozoomdar, a scholarly teacher from India, to Massachusetts in 1880. When he returned along with Swami Vivekananda to attend the 1893 World Parliament of Religions, he was overshadowed by Swami Vivekananda with his great oratorical skill. The beginning of Hinduism‚Äôs influence on the US is attributable to Vivekananda who established the Ramakrishna Mission (a non- sectarian organization that does not subscribe to caste distinctions) in India after visiting New York and Los Angeles in 1895. =19th century= During his first visit to the US, Vivekananda established the Vedanta Society in 1894. His urge to live as a sanyasi (renunciation of worldly pleasures) made him convert two of his disciples as sanyasis, Madame Marie Louise and Herr Leon Handsberg, and changed their names as Swami Abhayananda and Swami Kripananda respectively so that they could continue the work of the mission of the Vedantha Society. This society even to this day is filled with foreign nationals and is also located in Los Angeles. He then traveled in August 1885 to Europe for the next few months and returned to the US in 1985. Vivekananda became the catalyst for establishing the Vedanta Societies, the first Hindu group in America in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Vivekananda sent Swami Saradananda from India to assist him in the work of his Vedanta Society and deputed him to New York first and then toured many places in the US giving lectures. In Los Angeles, Vivekananda delivered a series of lectures at several notable locations, and gave lectures on the concept of ‚ÄúThe Way to the Realization of the Universalization of a Universal Religion‚Äù and others. He spent a month at the \\"Home of Truth\\" and noted that of all Americans, ‚ÄúCalifornians are specially fit to understand the raja-yoga of intuitive meditation which he labeled Applied Psychology‚Äù. Thereafter, many Vedanta centers were founded in California under the stewardship of C.F. Patterson. To keep up with the pace of development he recalled Turiyananda as one of his disciples to California. During this period of his stay in Los Angeles, Vivekananda was gifted a large area of land by one of his devotees, which was a forested hilly terrain about 12 miles from Lick Observatory, an area of 160 acres, to build a retreat to house Vedanta students. He called it a Peace retreat or Santi Asrama. Turiyananda trained students here in the art of ‚Äúmeditation and austere monastic life of India.‚Äù After the death of Vivekananda, it was Paramhahamsa Yogananda who took over the control of the Vendantha centers from 1920 and stayed in the US permanently. In 1925 he instituted the Yogananda Satsang. The American headquarters of the Vedantha Society (one of the twelve) in USA is located in Los Angeles. There is a Vedantha Press in Hollywood which publishes Hindu scriptures and translates texts to English. =20th century-present= The renaissance of Hinduism was followed by Baba Bharati, a hermit who lived in the US for five years from 1904‚Äì09 and established his cult in various parts of the country. He established the Rama Krishna Temple in Los Angeles, which had 5,000 followers. His teachings centered on the theme of preaching \\"eternal Hinduism unadulterated by the West\\". The next to make an entry to the Los Angeles Hinduism scene was yogi Hari Rama. He preached Hinduism only for a brief period from 1925 to 1 September 1928 and established his National headquarters of the Benares League in Los Angeles. His main activity centered on yoga but interspersed with some teachings related sociology and theology with the ‚Äúprofessed aim of communal and international brotherhood.‚Äù However, the success of Hinduism had a setback when the Asian Exclusion Act was introduced in 1924. Nonetheless, Swami Yogananda came to the US in 1920, founded the Self-Realization Fellowship, and introduced techniques of Kriya Yoga. He trained Benedict Lust, a specialist in naturopathic medicine. Prior to this Ramacharaka and Yogendra had also contributed to the spread of yoga throughout the US. Following the introduction of the new Immigration Act 1965, there was a flurry of Hindu religionists who invaded the US. Several movements came into existence throughout US such as the Maharishi Mehesh Yogi of the TM movement and Swami Bhaktivedanta of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKON), and Swami Satchidananda, founder of the Integral Yoga Institute. This was followed by the temple building boom in the east in the 1970s, which was followed in the 1980s and 1990s in other urban centers such as Los Angeles, and many other centers. The miraculous feat of milk offered to Hindu gods being supposedly \\"taken\\" by them was also witnessed at the Norwalk and Chatsworth temples. Occurrences of anti-Hindu acts have been reported in Los Angeles. According to the Hindu Temple Society in Los Angeles, the board members meet frequently and discuss the issue of hate crimes against Hindus and has noted that the City Zoning Regulations are adversely interpreted against their temple. Temples The American Hinduism community is to a large extent built around the traditional temple culture. The three dominant traditions followed in temple building, known in Hinduism as sampradaya, are; the worship of Vishnu by the Vaishnavites in his several incarnated forms of Krishna, Rama, Venkateshvara and so forth; worship of the Lord Shiva and his consort Parvathi including their children Muruga and Ganesh; and worship of Shakthi in the form of Devi, Durga, Kali, Lakshmi and many other formats. In the initial years, the temples were sampradaya specific while over the years the temples have been built with a multi-religious focus within the same structure or as any annexe structure. The temples in Los Angeles belong to both categories; the Malibu temple is devoted to Venkateshwara while many others are of the mixed type. =Malibu Hindu Temple= Situated in the hills above Malibu, in Calabasas, the Malibu Hindu Temple, established in 1984, was the \\"first big Hindu temple\\" in Los Angeles. The Malibu Hindu Temple is a mountain spiritual retreat. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Venkateswara and is fully functional. The priests of the temple live within its precincts. It caters to Southern California's Hindu population. The temple was the venue for a small scene in the movie Beverly Hills Ninja, in 1997, starring Chris Farley. In 1998, a song sequence was recorded around this temple in the Tamil film Jeans. In January 2006, pop star Britney Spears had her 4-month-old son blessed in a large ceremony by the Hindu priests of this temple. The event was covered worldwide by the media. =Other temples= While all states in the US have one or more Hindu centers of worship, California tops the list with 296 centers. Of these there are many Hindu temples in Los Angeles County. These include the Aurobindo Center of Los Angeles, Culver City; Hare Krishna Temple, Los Angeles; Radha Govinda Gaudiya Matha, Venice; RamKabir Mandir, Carson; Swami Narayan Hindu Temple, Whittier; the Sri Ashtalakshmi Sametha Venkateswara Swamy Temple, North Hollywood. Brief features of a few other Hindu temples are given below. The Sanatana Dharma Temple has the main Hindu deities deified in a row and regular religious and cultural festivals are part of the temple schedule. On the east side of Los Angeles is the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, spread over an area of 4 acres of land. The navagraha (idols of nine planets) ceiling in the temple is a special feature. The oldest temple in southern Los Angeles, the Radha-Krishna Temple contains idols of Radha and Krishna and also of Ram Parivar (Family of God Rama) and also of Lord Shiva, which setting is in line with current trend of mixed sampradaya temples. Another temple promoted by the Sindhi community is the Sindhu Temple. It has idols of Radha, Krishna, Ram Parivar, Lord Shiva and Parvati, all Hindu gods and in particular the Sindhi god Jhulelal and also Guru Nanak.

School in Tirabin al-Sana The overall population is over 20,000 (as of June 2013). There are also Bedouin living in unrecognized villages whose exact number is unknown. The al-Kasom Regional Council, as well as Neve Midbar Regional Council are the main arena for the implementation of the Prawer Plan, which was shelved in 2013. History =Legal background= Prior to the establishment of Israel, the Negev Bedouins were a semi-nomadic pastoralist society undergoing a process of sedentariness since the Ottoman rule of the region. During the British Mandate period, the administration did not provide a legal framework to justify and preserve lands‚Äô ownership. In order to settle this issue, Israel's land policy was adapted to a large extent from the Ottoman land regulations of 1858 as the only preceding legal frame. Thus Israel nationalized most of the Negev lands using the state's land regulations from 1969 and designated most of it for military and national security purposes. =Sedentarization= Home in Drijat The 1948 UN Partition Plan, which was accepted by the Jewish leaders, envisaged most of the Negev (including most of the ancestral Negev Bedouin territory) as part of a planned Arab state, with the Jewish State of Israel situated to the north in areas with an existing Jewish majority. However, after the rejection of the UN plan by the united Arab nations, their subsequent declaration of war on Israel, and their eventual defeat in the 1948 Palestine war, the Negev became part of Israel and the Negev Bedouin became Israeli citizens. The new Israeli government continued the policy of sedentarization of Negev Bedouins imposed by the Ottoman authorities in the early 20th century, mirroring developments in nearby Arab nations. Early stages of this process included regulation of previously open lands used for grazing and re-location of Bedouin tribes. In the decades after the war of independence, the Israeli government was concerned about the allegiance of the Negev Bedouin to the new State, and thus re-located two-thirds of the southern Bedouin population into a closed area under the authority of the IDF. This situation was maintained until the late 1970s. Private residence and farm in Umm Batin Starting in the 1980s the civilian government took back control of the northern Negev Bedouin from the IDF and began to establish purpose-built townships specifically for Bedouins in order to sedentarize and urbanize them, and to allow for the provision of government services. The government promoted these towns as offering better living conditions, proper infrastructure and access to public services in health, education, and sanitation. The new development towns constructed by the state in the 1980s absorbed a large proportion of the Negev Bedouin population but were unable to handle the entire Bedouin population, and their later reputation for crime and poor economy, together with a cultural preference for rural life, caused many Israeli Bedouin to shun these towns in favour of rural villages unapproved by the State. Today, the government estimates that about 60% of Bedouin citizens of Israel live in permanently planned towns, while the rest live in unrecognised villages spread throughout the Negev.Bedouin information, ILA, 2007 These villages are considered illegal under Israeli law, and their legal status, coupled with their periodic demolition and evacuation by police, is the subject of considerable debate. =Abu Basma regional council= In 2003, the government decided to establish a new regional council, known as the Abu Basma Regional Council, in order to oversee the resettlement and development of Bedouin communities in the area around Be'er Sheva, Dimona, and Arad.Beduin in Limbo The Jerusalem Post, 24 December 2007 This was coupled by the formal recognition of a number of existing Bedouin villages within the council in order to encourage Bedouin to move from other unrecognised/illegal villages elsewhere in the Negev.Government resolutions passed in recent years regarding the Arab population of Israel Abraham Fund Initiative The council was established by the Israeli Ministry of Interior on 28 January 2004.The Bedouin Population in Transition: Site Visit to Abu Basma Regional Council Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute, 28 June 2005 At the time, the regional council had a population of approximately 30,000 Bedouins and a total land area of 34,000 dunams, making it the most populous regional council in the Southern District but the smallest in jurisdiction.Spatial Inequality in the Allocation of Municipal Resources Adalah, December 2004 There was considerable controversy within the Bedouin community regarding the establishment of this council. The Regional Council of Unrecognized Villages (RCUV) argued that while the creation of the Abu Basma Regional Council would set a precedent for the transformation of unrecognized villages into urban ghettos by limiting their boundaries to the area of habitation and zoning most Bedouin grazing grounds; this type of de jure recognition has not entailed the introduction of business districts or de facto recognition through equitable provision of education, health, transportation and municipal waste services long denied to, and demanded, by the Bedouin community.RCUV Requests Comment to the Goldberg Commission regarding Bedouin Settlement in the NegevJonathan Cook.Making the land without a people ; Al-Ahram Weekly, 26 Aug-1 Sep 2004 =Prawer plan= In September 2011, the Israeli government approved a five-year economic development plan called the Prawer plan.Cabinet Approves Plan to Provide for the Status of Communities in, and the Economic Development of, the Bedouin Sector in the Negev, PMO official site, September 11, 2012 One of its implications is a relocation of some 30.000-40.000 Negev Bedouin from areas not recognized by the government to government-approved townships.Al Jazeera, 13 September 2011, Bedouin transfer plan shows Israel's racismGuardian, 3 November 2011, Bedouin's plight: \\"We want to maintain our traditions.

A vast investment of NIS 1.2 billion was approved by the government to promote employment among Bedouin women and youth. Funds were allocated to the development of industrial zones, such as Idan haNegev, establishment of employment centers and professional training. Tirabin al-Sana mosque under construction, using dome from mosque in old Tarabin encampment near Omer As a part of this plan some previously unrecognized Bedouin communities in the Negev would be officially recognized and receive all basic infrastructure: electricity, water, sewage, education and medical services. One of the main principles of this plan was close cooperation with the local Bedouin communities. The Prawer plan is meant to find a solution to numerous land claims filed by the Negev Bedouin. They claim the ownership of land totaling some 600,000 dunams (60,000 hectares or 230 square miles) - it is 12 times the size of Tel Aviv. It's physically impossible to approve all of these land claims because it will have a negative impact on all the local population and make it impossible to build and improve the infrastructure. In order to accept all these claims the state would have to give up on constructing industrial zones, ecological parks, highways and railroads that serve all the population of Israel, including the Bedouin.

The coastal cliff formations are the result of the erosion of oolitic rock beds located to the west of the entrance to Loch Bay. Reached via a road from the Carsaig Pier, the track is strewn with volcanic rocks and boulders and involves about 4 miles of walking to reach it. The first arch is visible at the end of the trek while descending from the ridge and looks as if it is opening into the sea and the second one is hidden. The openings created by wave action have been likened to cave entrances that \\"lead to another planet.\\" They are most easily approached during low tides. Of the two arches seen below the cliff, one has been described as being like a railway tunnel \\"deep and dark\\" and the other rises high and overlain by debris which is conjectured as being of an earlier collapsed arch. One of the formations is a pyramidal mass of rock, perforated through the middle by an unusually shaped arch (called the \\"keyhole\\"), and surmounted by the solitary shaft of a basaltic pillar. Another arch (\\"tunnel\\") is massive, with columnar basalts appearing to hang from the top.) It is in height over a length of with a width of .

There he led technical tasks related to building and construction control. In 1905 ≈†en co-founded the Croatian architects club (Klub hrvatskih arhitekta). From 1908 to 1919 he was a professor at the Technical School in Zagreb. He was one of the founders, in 1919, of the Faculty of Architecture, University of Zagreb and one of its first professors. Later he was elected rector of the Faculty of Architecture, University of Zagreb. ≈†en's work is strongly influenced by historical eclecticism. His early eclecticism is characterized by the idiosyncratic elements on the main facade of the Croatia osiguranje palace in Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk street, Zagreb. After 1918 his work shows the influence of the Modern architecture, but that influence was not applied dogmatically. Representative public buildings, such as the Institute of Forestry (1926) in Bo≈æidar Ad≈æija street, Zagreb, is massed in large cubic forms expressing restrained monumentality. Other Sen's realization of that era are apartment buildings \\"Mervar\\" (former \\"Society humanity home\\") in Petrinjska street and residential building \\"Bezuk\\" in Bo≈°koviƒáeva street, all in Zagreb. During his career he worked with the Croatian architect Juraj Denzler. In 1930 ≈†en started to work with another Croatian architect, Milovan Kovaƒçeviƒá. Kovaƒçeviƒá was also his assistant at the Faculty of Architecture, University of Zagreb. ≈†en died in Zagreb on 16 June 1949.

The system, created by Rebecca Lancefield, was historically used to organize the various members of the family Streptococcaceae, which includes the genera Lactococcus and Streptococcus, but now is largely superfluous due to explosive growth in the number of streptococcal species identified since the 1970s. However, it has retained some clinical usefulness even after the taxonomic changes, and as of 2018, Lancefield designations are still often used to communicate medical microbiological test results in the United States. Enterococcus, formerly known as Group D Streptococcus, were classified as members of the genus Streptococcus until 1984 and were included in the original Lancefield grouping. Many - but not all - species of streptococcus are beta-hemolytic. Notably, Enterococci and Streptococcus bovis (Lancefield Group D) are not beta-hemolytic. Though there are many groups of streptococcus, only five are known to commonly cause disease in immune- competent human beings: Group A, Group B, both members of Group D (Streptococcus gallolyticus and Streptococcus infantarius, both members of the Streptococcus bovis group), and two groups that lack the Lancefield carbohydrate antigen: Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Classification *Group A - Streptococcus pyogenes *Group B - Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus halichoeri *Group C - Streptococcus equisimilis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae *Group D - Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans and Streptococcus bovis *Group F, G & L - Streptococcus anginosus *Group H - Streptococcus sanguis *Group K - Streptococcus salivarius *Group L - Streptococcus dysgalactiae *Group M & O - Streptococcus mitis *Group N - Lactococcus lactis *Group R & S - Streptococcus suis Other Streptococcus species are classified as 'non-Lancefield streptococci'.
