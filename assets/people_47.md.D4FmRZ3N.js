It is widely believed to be an early Norse sun compass. right  Discovery  The disappearance of the Norse Greenlanders at some point in the 15th century remains one of the great historical mysteries. In 1948, Danish archaeologist Christen Veb√¶k was excavating the ruins of the Norse site √ò149 located on the western shore of a fjord known to the Norse as Siglufjord and is today called Uunartoq (\\"the hot\\"), a name that denotes both the fjord and the islands at its mouth. One of the islands is the site of geothermal hot springs well known to the Norse and the Inuit and is today a popular destination among tourists. Hot springs on Uunartoq, formerly called Siglufjord by the Norse. The Uunartoq disc was discovered on the north shore of this fjord, in the center background. The ruins at site √ò149 include a church and it is generally accepted to be the colony's Benedictine Convent referenced by Ivar Bardarson, a Norwegian priest who lived in the colony in the mid 14th century as a representative of the Archdiocese of Nidaros and the Norwegian crown.Helge Ingstad, Land Under the Pole Star (New York: St. Martin's, 1966), pg. 250-253 Among other artifacts, Veb√¶k discovered a fragment of a wooden disc with triangular notches chip carved around the perimeter and a hole in the centre. It was fashioned from softwood, likely larch or spruce (some sources indicate oak)Carl S√∏lver, \\"The discovery of an early bearing dial\\" (Cambridge: The Journal of Navigation, 1953) 6, 294 and measured just 7 centimetres wide, 1 centimetre thick and the central hole 1.7 centimetres in diameter.C.L. Veb√¶k et al, \\"The Church Topography of the Eastern Settlement and the Excavation of the Benedictine Convent at Narsarsuaq in the Uunartoq Fjord\\" (Copenhagen: Meddelelser om Gr√∏nland, Vol. 14 1995) pg. 65-70 A modern speculative replica of the Uunartoq disc, considerably larger than the original.Danish marine captain and naval historian Carl V. S√∏lver examined the notches and deliberate scored lines on the disc and pronounced it to be a sun compass used to determine true north, with the hole in the centre intended for a handle that housed a horizontal directional pin and a vertical pin to cast a shadow.The Church Topography... pg. 65-70 S√∏lver drew a speculative illustration from which a replica was fashioned, and this explanation was ultimately accepted by Veb√¶k.The Church Topography... pg. 70-71 The discovery of the artifact prompted increased interest among historians about the possible use of navigational instruments by the Norse, as many experts assumed that they relied solely on non-instrumental resources such as celestial bodies, landmarks or intuition.George Indruszewski, \\"Maritime skills and astronomic knowledge in the Viking Age Baltic Sea\\" (Studia Ljubljana: Mythologica Slavica, 2006) pg. 16-18) The magnetic compass does not appear to have been in use in Europe until the early 13th century.Alan Gurney, Compass: a Story of Exploration and Innovation (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2004) While the North Star had become an important navigational tool by the time of Pytheas and regarded as the \\"Ship-star\\" by the 10th centuryRichard H. Allen, Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning (New York: Dover, 1963), mariners on the open ocean out of sight from any landmark would have had great difficulty in precisely determining true north during daylight hours. While some scholars continued to argue against the theory of Norse marine instrumentationSoren Thirslund, \\"The Discovery of an Early Bearing-Dial ‚Äì Further Investigations\\" (Cambridge: The Journal of Navigation, 1993) 46,1 pg. 33-48, the discovery of a similar artifact with gnomonic lines in a Polish archaeological site near Wolin in 2000 has given further credence to the sun compass theory, particularly since the site dates from a period when the Norse had considerable impact in the region.Maritime skills and astronomic knowledge...pg.28-29  Method of Use  Like a sundial, a sun compass features a vertical pin. The sun's rays cause the pin to cast a shadow which is longer in the morning and late afternoon and shortest at solar high- noon, and this shadow is used to create gnomonic lines. The disc is placed in a fixed level position and an observer regularly marks the shifting position of the pin tip's shadow across the disc during the course of the day. When these position marks are connected, the result is a west-to-east gnomonic line that comes closest to the vertical pin at high-noon. In the northern hemisphere, a straight line drawn from the base of the pin to that closest high-noon position will point directly to true north, which will then serve as the compass' north index mark. The gnomonic line will be essentially straight during the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, and downward concave at the summer solstice. Modern replica showing gnomonic lines for the summer solstice (bottom), vernal and autumnal equinoxes (middle) and winter solstice (top). The original Uunartoq disc does not feature a line corresponding to the winter solstice, which would likely have been impractical during the limited daylight and low sun angle in Greenland at that time of year. Once these lines have been inscribed on the face of the compass, it can be used during travel. The user holds the device level and rotates it until the pin tip's shadow touches the appropriate seasonal gnomonic line, and the index mark will point to true north. S√∏lver noted that the Uunartoq disc appeared to have gnomonic lines consistent with those produced during the summer solstice and the equinoxes (which in 1990 were microscopically shown to be deliberately double traced)The Church Topography... pg. 71 and also noted that the disc had 8 triangular dial increments per quadrant, for a total of 32, corresponding with the traditional mariner's compass. In addition to its gnomonic lines, it also had a round dimple on the 9th increment that corresponds with east, where the lines end with the setting of the sun in the west. Modern replica showing how a course of Northwest by West may have been plotted by the Uunartoq disc's user around the time of the summer solstice. The traveller rotates the disc while keeping it level until the vertical gnomonic pin tip's shadow touches the summer solstice gnomonic line (1), which reveals the direction of true north (2). The traveller then turns the horizontal directional pin five compass points to the west for NWbW, and adjusts course to match the direction of the pin (3). In 1984, Norwegian author and explorer Ragnar Thorseth led an international expedition in a replica of a Norse merchant ship, the Saga Siglar. For the passage between Iceland and Greenland, the crew had been given replicas of the Uunartoq disc to test against the ship's modern magnetic compass, and the deviation between the two was described as \\"negligible\\" and \\"...results were far better than the navigators had expected...\\"The Church Topography... pg. 69  Possible Use as Latitude Reader  In 2013, researchers from E√∂tv√∂s University in Hungary argued that the Uunartoq disc could have also been used to determine a traveller's latitude.Bal√°zs Bern√°th et al, \\"An alternative interpretation of the Viking sundial artifact\\" (London: Proceedings Of The Royal Society, 2013) pg. 13 The researchers pointed to a series of very short inscribed lines stacked atop one another on the disc's north index mark, whereas gnomonic lines by necessity run from west to east across the sun compass's face. Under this theory, the disc's user would have made a reference point at the north index mark at high-noon just prior to departure and then made subsequent high-noon marks during the course of the journey, and compared these against their home's reference point. If the journey's marks were in the same position as the home reference point, it meant that the user had been maintaining a consistent latitude. A high-noon mark coming in below the home reference meant that one was further south (although travellers also would have had to make allowances for the constant seasonal changes of the sun's position at high-noon).  S√≥larsteinn  Iceland Spar Whether the Norse used these sorts of devices primarily as compasses or latitude readers, both relied on the sun. It is believed that on overcast days, Norse mariners made use of a sun stone, likely clear Iceland Spar (Calcium Calcite) which can be used as a polarization analyzer to find the sun's position through the clouds.Gypsey Teague, \\"Early Norse Navigation Tools\\" (Columbus: 105th Annual Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Studies, 2015) presentation There are references to the possible Norse use of sun stones in two Icelandic Sagas; Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar (\\"The King looked about and saw no blue sky...then the King took the Sunstone and held it up, and then he saw where the Sun beamed from the stone\\") and the Saga of St. Olaf (\\"Olaf grabbed a Sunstone, looked at the sky and saw from where the light came, from which he guessed the position of the invisible Sun\\").Guy Ropars et al., \\"The sunstone and polarised skylight: ancient Viking navigational tools?\\" (Contemporary Physics: Volume 55, 2014) Issue 4 In addition to their work demonstrating the Uunartoq disc's possible use as a latitude reader, the E√∂tv√∂s University researchers also argued that if the disc was used with a pair of sun stones, it might have been possible to detect true north up to 50 minutes after sunset, thus serving as a \\"twilight compass\\" as well.Bal√°zs Bern√°th et al, \\"How could the Viking Sun compass be used with sunstones before and after sunset?\\" (London: Proceedings Of The Royal Society, 2014) pg. 1-18 A 2018 study by different researchers at E√∂tv√∂s found that \\"sky-polarimetric Viking navigation is surprisingly successful at spring equinox and summer solstice even in cloudy weather...\\" D√©nes Sz√°z and G√°bor Horv√°th, \\"Success of sky-polarimetric Viking navigation: revealing the chance Viking sailors could reach Greenland from Norway\\" (London: Proceedings Of The Royal Society, 2018) 5, 4  Appearance in Popular Culture  In the History Channel's television series Vikings, a sun compass very similar in appearance to the Uunartoq disc was a significant plot device in the first season, as it allowed the Norsemen to maintain a consistent latitude while sailing west on the open ocean to raid Britain, though it was shown floating in water rather than hand-held as envisioned by S√∏lver.

It was published in 1833 and is one of the Sc√®nes de la vie de province of La Com√©die humaine. Plot summary Felix Gaudissart is a successful and ambitious travelling salesman, based in Paris. He is nicknamed \\"The Illustrious Gaudissart\\". He has previously sold clothing and hats, but at the start of the story he has also taken up selling life insurance and subscriptions to newspapers. The latter include newspapers advocating Saint- Simonianism and republicanism, and he learns the Saint-Simonian doctrine without having any belief in it. He sets off to the Touraine area on a sales trip, and during this trip stays in the town of Vouvray. He tries to sell his items to a local man named Vernier, without realising that Vernier is strongly opposed to Saint-Simonianism. As a practical joke, Vernier recommends that he sells his items to his insane neighbour Margaritis. After a long discussion with Margaritis filled with comic misunderstandings, Gaudissart sells some children's newspaper subscriptions to him, and also agrees to buy two barrels of wine from Margaritis. Vernier eavesdrops on this conversation and brags about it to his friends. When he gets back to his hotel, the landlord tells Gaudissart that he has been fooled, and that the wine barrels he bought from Margaritis do not exist. Gaudissart is angry about this, and then confronts Vernier and challenges him to a duel. The next morning Gaudissart and Vernier meet for their duel and both deliberately miss their shots. They then reconcile, and a relieved Vernier agrees to buy some children's newspaper subscriptions from him. Gaudissart then threatens to take legal action over the nonexistent barrels of wine that Margaritis owes him, so Madame Margaritis agrees to pay him compensation for these instead.

Biography  Although more learned then his brother Gamaliel, his father had intended that Simeon only become the hakham of his yeshivah, while his elder brother Gamaliel was to be Judah's successor as nasi.Mishnah Ketubot 103b Simeon did not carry the title of nasi himself, but carried it in his patronymic. The Talmud states that Simeon transmitted traditions to illustrious contemporary scholars such as ·∏§iyya the Great with whom he learned Psalms and Bar Kappara, with whom he learned halakic midrashim of Leviticus. Neither Hiyya or Bar Kappara recognized Simeon as their teacher and refused to honour him as such, which apparently upset him.Mishnah Kiddushin 33a‚Äìb When his father was on his deathbed, he appointed Simeon as the hakham (similar to rosh yeshiva) of his yeshivah in Beit Shearim, previously stating that Simeon was \\"the light of Israel\\".Arakhin 10a; Menachot 88b Maimonides traditionally claimed 37 generations between him and Simeon, although, this has remained unproven. Teachings Simeon introduced several explanations in the Talmud, which he claimed to have been passed on from his father. The Talmud states that he did not approve of the fact that his father and grandfather, Simeon ben Gamaliel II cited sayings of R. Me√Ør without mentioning his name. One of his more famous teachings is in regards to the later chapters of Deuteronomy 12 which states a man will be rewarded for not drinking the blood of an animal sacrifice. On this Simeon states that \\"If a person is rewarded for refraining from partaking of blood, which is repugnant to man, how much more so will he and his future generations be deemed meritorious for refraining from robbery and incest to which men are attracted!\\". In other words Simeon explains that because one rewarded for resisting an unnatural urge, one is rewarded even more so for resisting a natural urge such as robbery or unnatural fornication.

No event could better summarize Cram's influence on American church architecture, for it was Cram himself, in his condemnation of \\"Carpenter Gothic\\" (and nineteenth-century American Gothic in general), who had succeeded in \\"revolutionizing the entire visual expression of American Christianity in this century.\\"Douglass Shand-Tucci, Church Building in Boston p. 99 Of \\"Carpenter Gothic,\\" for example, Cram had written, \\"the sheer savagery of these box-like wooden structures, with their toothpick pinnacles and their adventitious buttresses of seven-eights-inch board and their jigsaw ornament, find no rival in all history.\\"Ralph Adams Cram, My Life in Architecture p. 30 Cram forcefully argued that nineteenth-century American Gothic has resulted in nothing but sham and pretentiousness, and he considered the fifty-year period after 1930 to have been \\"worse than at any time or in any place recorded in history.\\"Cram, The Gothic Quest p. 148 Such a strident polemic was based on moral as well as aesthetic grounds. According to Cram, the nineteenth-century Gothicists had been guilty of practicing \\"archaeology\\" rather than art, through the servile imitation of historical models. Furthermore, by their use of sham materials and construction methods, they had added pretentiousness to their sins. Cram, thus, argued for a return to the first principles of Gothic architecture whereby the artificial, derivative qualities of the previous decades could be avoided and a new organic structural integrity as well as functional responsiveness could be gained. In short, he advised architects \\"to study the motives and principles of Medieval Christian architecture rather than the mouldings.\\"Cram, The Church Building p. 11 In addition, Cram, by way of Ruskin, had fully embraced the doctrine of honest structural expression which, in church buildings, became for Cram an inviolable law: \\"If a church is not honest - honest in its design, its construction, its decoration-it is nothing; and any added richness, if it is the richness of falsity, is only added sham.\\"Cram, The Church Building p. 85 History The parish was established in Americus, Georgia in 1864 as the second attempt by the Episcopal Church to establish a presence in the city. In 1869, Bishop John W. Beckwith presided over the placement of the cornerstone for the first church house. In 1905, Reverend James Bolan Lawrence became rector of the parish, a position he would hold until 1947. In 1910, the church hosted the annual convention for the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia. In March 1919, construction began on the current building, built on the same location as the original building. The architect in charge of the building's design was noted ecclesiastical architect Ralph Adams Cram. The building was completed in 1921. In 2000, major renovations were completed on the building. In 2014, the Georgia Historical Society erected a Georgia historical marker commemorating the history of the church. In 2017, the church and the nearby Lee Street Bridge were placed on the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation's list of Places in Peril due to concerns regarding the replacement of the Lee Street Bridge with a larger bridge that could negatively affect the historicity of the area. These concerns were later satiated, as the replacement bridge was the same height as the previous bridge.

Her mother, Ximena Bernales, was a competitive bodybuilder and owned personal training boutique fitness studios.  Career  King began her professional career as a dancer. She toured as a dancer and teacher and was the lead in a Cirque Du Soleil production in Las Vegas. In 2008, she was a Top 10 finalist on So You Think You Can Dance. She was dancing in a show in NYC when her producer suggested she take a meeting with Peloton, a new fitness startup looking for coaches. By the time she met with Peloton founder and CEO, John Foley, she had never been on a spin bike in her life. King began working as a cycling instructor at Peloton. During her instructor training, she learned the practical elements of the bike like resistance and cadence metrics as well as teaching tips like how to ride and speak simultaneously or how to map out a class. She found the transition from dance to fitness instruction to be easy and natural, particularly since she was well-practiced in musicality and performance. Her initial motivation for taking the Peloton job was because of a promise of fame and celebrity status by Foley. In recent years, however, she has described the power of connecting with riders and empowering people through fitness as the primary motivation for her work.  Personal life  King has been in a relationship with musician Sophia Urista since February 2015. They became engaged in September 2020, and live in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York City.

Clark Street in the Andersonville neighborhood in Chicago. The store was founded in 1979 by Ann Christophersen and Linda Bubon as a feminist bookstore and place to celebrate and support women authors and members of the Chicago community. Women & Children First specializes in books by and about women, children's books, and LGBT literature. Description Women & Children First is one of the largest feminist bookstores in the United States, with about 30,000 books in stock. Books are \\"curated with an inclusive and queer-minded lens\\" and the store is \\"known for its diversity and queer-friendliness\\". One of the goals of the bookstore is to \\"support the work of women in books and in community\\". Women & Children First carries not only important feminist literary works, but also focuses on works related to other political and progressive movements, with a particularly strong selection of books by and about the LGBTQIA+ community. Children's books make up twenty percent of the store's sales; other popular categories are cookbooks, art books, education, and parenting. Author readings and signings are frequent events, as are events for children such as drag queen story time. Notable speakers at the store have included former president Jimmy Carter, Gloria Steinem, Margaret Atwood, Alice Walker, Studs Terkel, and other activists and literary figures. Since a 2015 renovation which provided additional event space, more community-oriented activities have taken place including writing workshops, support groups, and social activities for local community groups. History Women & Children First was founded in November 1979 by Ann Christophersen and Linda Bubon, students at the University of Illinois at Chicago. They were part of the feminist movement and saw a market need when they had a difficulty finding books by the women authors they wanted to study. Bubon and Christophersen built the store's bookshelves themselves and spent $15,000 on stocking the store with feminist- themed material and children's books which promoted girls as active agents. Women & Children First's first location was located on Armitage Avenue in the Lakeview neighborhood; in the 1980s they moved to a location on Halstead Avenue, and settled in Andersonville in its current location in 1990. The bookstore had steady growth from its opening until the early 1990s, but struggled financially when large bookstore chains moved into Chicago. The store adjusted by selling textbooks and making staffing changes, but when Amazon and other Internet retailers sold books for far less than retail price as loss leaders in the early 2000s, Women & Children First faced some of its hardest years. In 2014, owners Bubon and Christophersen sold Women & Children First to two of their employees, Lynn Mooney and Sarah Hollenbeck. The next year, extensive renovations were completed for a dedicated events and community space for author readings and community group meetings, and a mural was created illustrating notable woman authors who had spoken at the bookstore. The 2016 presidential election energized young feminists, increasing foot traffic and visits to the store's website, and the store rebounded financially in the late 2010s. For its 40th anniversary in 2019, Women & Children First featured a panel of the store's former and current owners as well as presenting a list of the store's top 20 all-time best- sellers, with books including My Life on the Road by Gloria Steinem, Bad Feminist by Roxane Gay, and The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros. In popular culture TV series Portlandia gently mocked feminist bookstores, including Women & Children First, in a recurring sketch titled \\"Women and Women First\\", which was filmed in Portland feminist bookstore In Other Words.

It argues that, in order to manage the power shift from humans to increasingly advanced artificial intelligence, it will be necessary to instill human values into artificial intelligence, and to proactively develop oversight mechanisms.  Overview  Coleman argues that the algorithms underlying artificial intelligence could greatly improve the human condition, if the algorithms are carefully based on ethical human values. An ideal artificial intelligence would be \\"not a replicated model of our own brains, but an expansion of our lens and our vantage point as to what intelligence, life, meaning, and humanity are and can be.\\" Failure in this regard might leave us \\"a species without a purpose\\", lacking \\"any sense of happiness, meaning, or satisfaction\\". She states that despite stirrings of an \\"algorithmic accountability movement\\", humanity is \\"alarmingly unready\\" for the arrival of more powerful forms of artificial intelligence.  Reception  A review in Library Journal strongly recommended the book to \\"both the cyber crowds and those interested in human psychology\\". Kirkus called the book \\"meaty\\" and \\"energetic\\".

Narrative overview  Zoroastrian temple of Yazd, Iran. The text begins with the priest Narsai and his companion Shapur acquiring land and a land title in Rayy from the Zoroastrian convert Adarparwa to build a church. Adarparwa though is persuaded by the local mobad Adurboze to renounce the church Narsai had constructed, and instead, convert it into a Fire Temple. Adarparwa complies and converts the church into a temple while Narsai is absent, but upon his return, Narsai tosses the sacred items out and extinguishes the fire. This causes a crowd to form and Narsai is brought to Adurboze in Ctesiphon for interrogation; Adurboze requested Narsai to restore the temple but refuses. (Acts of Narsai, 173) Narsai was then ransomed but is later returned for interrogation by a marzban who was given orders from Yazdegerd I to release Narsai if Narsai denies his involvement with putting out the fire or is willing to replace it. Narsai acknowledges his involvement and refuses to apologize; Narsai is condemned to death. (Acts of Narsai, 175-6) Narsai is then escorted to the place of execution, but while being escorted, he passes by a monastery. There, monks offer him water but he refused, but Narsai requested that they pray for him instead. In his execution, a lictor who is a Christian apostate was supposed to execute Narsai but was struck down by God. Narsai though is eventually beheaded by a magian. (Acts of Narsai, 178-9) Narsai's head, blood, and body are then taken by Christians to be buried at a site built by Mar Marutha, bishop of Suf. The remains of Narsai are later taken by the author of the text and others to the place where Lawarne was martyred for the benefit and healing of the people, but also in concern that the magians would despoil the body during a new persecution. The text is concluded with a request from Christ, 'lord of the martyrs' to grant us an inheritance in the kingdom of heaven along side the martyrs 'who were crowned with his love'. (Acts of Narsai, 180)  Authorship  The Acts of Narsai is one of four hagiographical works composed in a monastery near Ctesiphon, the others are Tataq, the ten martyrs of Beth Garmai, and Jacob the notary which all have been dated to the middle of the 5th century and all recount similar events to that of the Acts of Abda. Paul Devos contributes all the texts to the monk Abgar who lived in Ctesiphon where the executions of the martyrs were taking place just outside the city in the field Sliq harubta. Sliq harubta is also where the monks of Abgar's monastery gathered the relics of the martyrs. Richard Payne dates the composition between 421 and 424, and notes that Abgar was the only hagiographer who's name and context was known in the fifth and sixth centuries that composed four hagiographical works that produced cults of martyrs from the reigns of Yazdegerd I and Bahram V.

Yankovsky (May 15, 1911 ‚Äì April 17, 2010) was a Polish-origin Russian writer and a sharpshooter. Born in the Russian Far East, his family moved to what is now North Korea, where he spent many years in the Gulags. There he wrote many accounts of his family and life in the region.  Biography  Yankovksy was born in the Vladivostok region to Yuri (\\"George\\", leading to the patronymic middle name Georgevich or Yurevich and corresponding initials G., I. or Y.) and Margarita, daughter of the shipping entrepreneur Mikhail G. Shevelev. His grandfather was the Polish settler Micha≈Ç Jankowski. At an early age he began to hunt with his parents and earned a reputation for sharpshooting. He was nicknamed \\"nenuni sonja\\" by the local Koreans as his grand father had been called \\"nenuni\\" or four-eyed for his legendary skills and supposed sixth-sense while out hunting. In 1922, the family moved to northern Korea where they established Novina and Lukomorye resorts near Chongjin. When the Japanese occupied Korea, the family supplied meat to the Japanese army. Valery went to study at the Harbin Men's Gymnasium followed by studies at the Forestry College in Pyongyang. The Japanese police who knew his sharpshooting and hunting skills once showed him a photograph of a rebel hiding in the local forests and offered him a bounty of 10000 yen for his head. Valery declined due to sympathies with the locals and many years later learned that this target had been Kim Il-sung. In 1944, he moved to Manchuria and from 1945 he worked in the Soviet Army serving as a translator with knowledge of Japanese, Korean, and Russian. In 1946 he was arrested because of the family history, both as a White Russian and \\"for assisting the international bourgeoisie\\", since his family had supported the enemy, the Japanese army. He went to labour camp for six years, which was then extended to 10 years, and an attempt to escape led to a further extension to 25 years. During his sentence at the Gulags, he obtained through the camp management, information on his father and was able to exchange some correspondence. He was released in 1952 after which he worked in a mine in Chukotka and then at Magadan as a forester. He married Vera Maslakova (1912-1980) in Harbin in 1943, but the marriage did not last. In 1944 he married Irma Mayer (1924-1997) and they had a son Sergei. But after his arrest his wife was unable to contact him and she moved to Canada along with her son. He was rehabilitated in 1957 and he married Irina Kazimirovna Piotrovskaya (1924-2010) and moved to lived in Vladimir in 1968 after their son was born. He was in communication with his sisters Musa and Victoria who lived in the United States of America. In 1986, under Gorbachev's relaxation of rules, he was allowed to visit Canada and he met his first wife Irma and his son, then aged forty. The family also had a reunion when a statue of his grandfather was unveiled on September 15, 1991 in the village Bezverkhovo. Attendees included Valery, his son Arseny, sister Victoria, her son and two grandchildren, a grandson of Captain Fridolf Heck, and staff from the Arsenyev Museum. A member of the Union of Writers of the USSR he published several stories and published in magazines. He was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War, 2nd degree, \\"For the victory over Japan\\".

The game follows the player's custom character as they work through a fictional social media account as they try to \\"climb the ladder\\" on a space station. The game's title refers to a redshirt, a stock character in fiction who dies soon after being introduced. Mitu Khandaker was inspired to create Redshirt after her experience from working at a social media startup. The game received mixed reviews from critics, who felt that the game had mostly shallow mechanics, despite generally complimenting its successfully focused nature on what it was lampooning.  Gameplay  Redshirt is a social simulation game, where the player controls a new character on a fictional space station in the future who is obsessed with \\"Spacebook\\" (a satire of Facebook). The player's character interacts with people and things on the ship through the Spacebook. As players interact with the environment, they gain interests and skills which help them advance throughout the game. Development Mitu Khandaker, the lead developer of the game, had been interested in the dynamics that social networks and games that emulated social behavior presented. Mitu had previously worked for a social media start-up, which had helped to inspire her work on Redshirt. She pitched the idea of a fake social network that was full of non-playable characters to Positech Games, who supported the idea but asked her to add a sci-fi theme to the work. She intentionally called the game a \\"disempowerment fantasy\\", focusing players on the banality of the future instead of presenting powerful opportunities to players. Red Dwarf was a large influence in the tone of the game, along with Star Trek references and social media in general. Mitu stressed in an interview that the game was designed to show how social resources use people as resources instead of highlighting them as people.  Reception  In a review for IGN, Rowan Kaiser felt that Redshirt was a \\"generally successful experiment in social simulation\\", but noted that there were some glitches (although they also commended the developer for quickly patching them). GameSpot's Britton Peele was more negative, noting that the game became repetitive, although commending the game for being an apt parody.

In October 1910 (one week after the establishment of the Republic) the name Teatro do Pr√≠ncipe Real was changed to Teatro S√° da Bandeira. One of his most notable entrepreneurs was Afonso Taveiro, who would die of apoplexy in the theater audience, when he was directing the general rehearsal of Eduardo Schwalbach's magazine \\"O dia do Ju√≠zo\\". However, in 1909 his greatest mentor emerged: Arnaldo Moreira da Rocha Brito great entrepreneur \\"free-thinker\\" who was entrepreneur of this theater until his death in 1970 completing 60 years of management. This man from Porto stands out because he was also the first tenant of the Coliseu do Porto ... having maintained this management for 8 years ... leaving for not agreeing with the then Salazarist politicism. It was one of the first, if not the first theater in Porto, to use electric lighting instead of gas lighting. In May 1899, when the D. Maria II National Theater Company of Lisbon appeared there, the advertising posters contained the indication that \\"In all the shows of this company, the room and the stage are illuminated by electric light, which provides viewers with a pleasant temperature \\". In April 2009 it went on sale for 5.5 million euros. On June 23, 2017, the Porto City Council purchased the theater for 2.1 million euros from the approximately 60 owners of the space, heirs of five families. The C√¢mara do Porto launched a classification process with the Directorate- General for Cultural Heritage, also awarding it the distinction as an Entity of Historical and Cultural or Social Local Interest. In March 2019, the Chamber of Porto decided to sell the theater at public auction for the base bid price of 2.190 million euros, considering that \\"the utility of maintaining the building in question\\" was exhausted\\". It was purchased by Livraria Lello on 30 May 2019 for 3.5 million euros.  Features  The building includes, in addition to the theater, three stores, and has a total of five thousand square meters of covered area. In addition to the main room, the theater has two more cinemas.

It is a free-to-play entry in the Dragon Quest series and was released in Japan on 12 September 2019. Gameplay The gameplay of Dragon Quest Walk is centered around interaction with various real-world locations in-game, with various monsters and characters from the Dragon Quest series being in the game. Players could battle monsters in order to improve their character and obtain items, or in order to advance quests. The quests system in the game require players to walk towards certain destinations in real life, which would unlock enemies or interactions with in- game characters. Various locations in the game would also restore the player character's hit points. The battles with monsters involve the player character, or their party with other players, engaging with one or more monsters. Once the battle is completed, players may receive items which could be equipped on their characters in order to improve their skills. As with other games in the JRPG genre or in the Dragon Quest series, players may opt to automatically resolve the battle without additional input. Occasionally, more powerful monsters may appear in the in-game map, which could be fought by up to 12 players simultaneously. Within the game, players could also establish \\"home\\" locations wherever they would like. These homes could be customized with various decorations, similar to the MMO Dragon Quest X. Development Walk was developed by Japanese mobile studio COLOPL, with planning and production being done by Square Enix. Its development was first announced in June 2019, and a beta registration was opened to enroll 20,000 beta testers (10,000 for Android and iOS each). Walk had Yuji Horii as General director, Akira Toriyama as character and monster designer and Koichi Sugiyama as composer. Dragon Quest Walk was released on 12 September 2019 in Japan for Android and iOS. Reception Within the first week of its release, the game had been downloaded over five million times. Analytics company Sensor Tower estimated that the game received 86 million in revenue during in first month, while throughout 2019, Walk generated US$201 million in revenue, making it the second-highest grossing location-based mobile game after Pok√©mon Go and ahead of the China-exclusive Let's Hunt Monsters in third place. In January 2020, a partnership with Suntory was established, where 14,000 of their vending machines across Japan would act as in-game locations to restore health and receive special missions.

It generally only known as a cultivated garden plant, but plants have been recorded a few times surviving in abandoned areas in northern Europe, especially in Finland. The cultivar 'Johanniswolke' is considered an attractive ornamental perennial plant. Description Like the other species of the former genus Aconogonon (all now classified in Koenigia), the hybrid is a perennial, growing from short rhizomes. It grows to about , with leaves up at least long and about wide. The hybrid is intermediate in appearance between its parents. It differs from Koenigia weyrichii in having less persistent ochreas (sheaths surrounding the stems), less pointed leaves with fewer hairs on the underside, pedicels that are jointed in the upper part, and larger tepals. It has broader leaves than Koenigia alpina, with a width at least 40% of the length. It usually does not produce fertile seed. Inflorescence The hybrid may have arisen a number of times in Europe. Reiersen, who had studied the taxon since the late 1980s, noted in 2000 that Danish plants had hairier leaves than the other Scandinavian plants, and that Danish plants produced fertile pollen and differed in other small aspects of the floral morphology. There were three plants known in Britain until the 2000s, two of them cultivated in botanical gardens, these differed from each other, and from the Scandinavian collections, with the plant from Yorkshire producing fertile seed. Taxonomy Scandinavian plants of Koenigia √ó fennica had originally been identified as K. mollis in Nordic floras, but in 1999 Reiersen described them as a new hybrid, Aconogonon √ó fennicum, both purported parents (now Koenigia alpina and K. weyrichii) then being placed in the genus Aconogonon. Clive A. Stace, who in the 1997 edition of the New Flora of the British Isles had classified the three known British plants as a variant of Persicaria alpina, promptly moved the taxon to P. √ó fennica in 2002, believing Aconogonon to be invalid as a genus. Aconogonon has since been subsumed into Koenigia. The genus Koenigia is placed in the tribe Persicarieae, whose taxonomic history has been described as \\"exceptionally convoluted, even by Polygonaceae standards\\". The generic boundaries within the tribe have varied considerably; Koenigia √ó fennica has also been placed in Persicaria and Polygonum. The orthographical variant Aconogonum is used by some sources. Distribution It was widespread in cultivation in Nordic countries, especially Finland, when first described in 1999. The first plants appeared in the 1970s in Finland. Reiersen in 2000 recorded over 100 instances of it being found in Finland, a dozen or so each in Norway and Denmark, and twice in Sweden. By 2018 it had been found 514 times in Finland. It is recorded as a \\"new resident alien\\" in the 2019 Checklist of the Vascular Plants of Finland, and \\"spreading in the wild\\". It has only been found once as a garden escape in Britain, a plant found in 1981 in Yorkshire. In Belgium it has been sighted twice as a garden escape on abandoned grounds, both in 2014. Horticulture The cultivar 'Johanniswolke' first appeared in Germany in the early 2000s as Aconogonon 'Johanniswolke', supposedly as a collection from Asia. It is often classified as \\"A. speciosum\\" in horticulture. Around the same time the hybrid was also being sold elsewhere in Europe under the name \\"Polygonum polymorphum\\" or \\"Persicaria polymorpha\\", and different other combinations of these names now exist in horticulture. Neither P. polymorpha nor Aconogonon speciosum exist as valid taxonomic names, these are horticultural inventions, whereas Polygonum polymorphum is a synonym of the related Koenigia alpina. The plant has been called \\"white dragon knotweed\\" in the USA. This plant is grown as an ornamental perennial. It grows to a height of . Flowering in June, or July to August in far northern latitudes, it has creamy white flowers which turn pink as they age. Although shrub-like in appearance, it is herbaceous, dying back to the ground over winter. It has been described as \\"very good value for almost instant impact\\" and an \\"eye-catcher\\", although some people find the flower scent to be unpleasant. In Finland the hybrid can even be grown in gardens in the north of the country. It is recommended for use as a hedge in climates where the weight of excessive snowfall destroys hedges made of shrubs. The cultivar 'Johanniswolke' is supposed to be somewhat smaller than the nominate form, although it grows just as tall as the plants circulating under the name P. polymorpha. It is furthermore said to be sterile, flowers which become dark pink after anthesis, and to have non-invasive rhizomes which stay short and compact. P. polymorpha is said to sometimes send up a shoot less than a meter from the main clump after many years, have a rhizome which is able to grow 50cm downward to escape a barrier, and to rarely produce black berries.

It was also commonly known as Parti de L'ind√©pendance. It was formed in 1966 to unite the Labour Party (Mauritius), Independent Forward Bloc (IFB) and Comit√© d'Action Musulman (CAM) at the time when the island nation was a colony of Great Britain. History The Independence Party was founded soon after a delegation of Mauritian representatives returned to Mauritius following the 1965 Lancaster Conference which was held in England. The main objective of forming an alliance of the 3 political parties (Labour, IFB and CAM) was to represent the voters who supported independence from colonial power Great Britain which administered the island since 1810. General elections were scheduled to occur in August 1967 to formally determine whether locals wanted a separation from United Kingdom. Since 1960 the British administration had started discussions with local representatives regarding their departure from the colony as it withdrew its military regiment from the island in the same year. The All Mauritius Hindu Congress (AMHC) did not form part of the Independence Party although it had been influential in prior elections such as in 1963. By 1969 the IFB had left the ruling coalition that had made up the original Independence Party. However the reduced alliance of the Labour Party and CAM kept using the name \\"Independence Party\\" for several years including the 1976 General Elections. Electoral victory The Independence Party won the 1967 General elections after their main rival anti-Independence Parti Mauricien Social D√©mocrate (PMSD) lost heavily. Indeed the Labour-IFB-CAM alliance secured 54.6% of votes compared to 43.5% of votes for its rival PMSD. It formed a Cabinet under Prime Minister Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam after securing 43 seats out of a total of 70. However whilst in office disagreements soon developed among the partners of the coalition and IFB gradually lost its influence. At the 1970 by-elections in Constituency No.5 the coalition lost its seat to a brand new party MMM's candidate. The 1970 by-elections had been triggered by the untimely death of IFB Attorney General Lall Jugnauth. Subsequently the 1972 general elections were cancelled due to political unrest. Then at the 1976 elections the Independence Party was made up of Labour Party and CAM only as IFB had opted out of the coalition. Ideology The Independence Party of Mauritius was a centre-left party. It practised a socialist way of government whilst supporting the growth of employment through private enterprise which was then dominated by the sugar industry. It later started to actively promote the growth of the tourism industry. In government the priorities of the Independence Party were education of the masses, control of the high population growth, reduction of unemployment, improvement of healthcare, water and sanitation. The Independence Party was only partially economically liberal especially given the predominance of private ownership of the mills and plantations of the sugar industry, and advocated limited government intervention in the economy. It supported the creation of a welfare state. The party attempted to be social liberal on some social issues and practised censorship of mass media. Political support During its existence the Independence Party had strong support of the majority of Hindu voters as well as Muslim voters. It was not popular with General Population (mixed ancestry Creole, Chinese and Whites) voters who were predominantly Catholic and Anglican. Gradually the influence of Hindu-centered IFB within the alliance withered during the first term in office. By the end of that term the leader of Labour Party already started to work closely with what used to be his ideological rival Ga√´tan Duval at PMSD, so much so that they collaborated to amend the Constitution in 1972 to cancel the planned general elections. Organisation The coalition of parties was active during the electoral campaign. Once the 1967 elections were over the constituent parties reverted to their individual structures and original way of operating. Leadership The Independence Party alliance was led by Labour leader Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, IFB leader Basdeo Bissoondoyal and CAM leader Abdool Razack Mohamed.

Discovery  A day after the discovery of the foot, the Investigations Police found the victim's head in the same sector, with two 9mm bullets, cuts on the cheeks and with a sliced off nose. On March 29th, his arms were found, with the hands removed and four tattoos torn off. The day after, his left foot was also discovered. On April 2nd, two female plastic collectors reported to the police the discovery of two hands with fingerprints ripped off in a bag at the end of Avenida Santa Rosa, in Puente Alto. The next day, in the commune of San Bernardo, a woman found the victim's torso, with its guts and buttocks removed, inside a garbage container.  Investigation  Genetic testing was carried out on all the located parts, which confirmed that they indeed belonged to one person, but the police didn't know the decedent's identity with certainty. To find his name, forensic experts reconstructed his ten fingerprints from the edges that were left on his buds and from small flaps of skin that the killer didn't tear off three of his fingers. During the process, a Cupid tattoo which was ignored by the killer also aided the investigators, who photographed it to be shown in various jails around the country, hoping that some prisoner might recognize them. This tactic paid off because one inmate claimed to have made that tattoo tom one of his former cellmates, confirming that the victim was recorded in the archives of the Gendarmerie. Once the portraits of the fingerprints were obtained, they were compared with three registers: those of the Civil Registry, of the Civil Police and the Gendarmerie. At this time, Hans Pozo's name had already been disclosed by the press as a possible identity for the hitherto named \\"Dismembered of Puente Alto\\", which was leaked online. His facial composite, made by the Legal Medical Service, was also publicly available by order of the South Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office. Despite thirteen alleged relatives undergoing DNA tests, none tested positive, since Pozo's real family, until then, had not claimed the body or filed a complaint for his alleged death.  Identification  On April 6, 2006, ten days after the discovery of the first clue, the Investigations Police confirmed that the victim's name was Hans Hern√°n Pozo Vergara, born in the commune of Independencia on July 2, 1985. Known in his home with the nicknames ¬´El Rucio¬ª and ¬´El Julipi¬ª, his last recorded residence was located in San Ram√≥n. After his identification, his family contacted the police. Thereafter, the press reported, among other things, that Pozo had a 3-year-old daughter, had a criminal record for theft and robbery, was a drug addict, sporadically worked as a construction worker and displayed homosexual behavior. According to a report in the newspaper La Cuarta, based on sex workers who knew Pozo, he engaged in the trade near Plaza de Armas in Santiago in 2006. In the same article, the president of Sidacci√≥n confirmed that Pozo went to that organization in 2004 to test if he had HIV, although an ELISA test was never performed. Pozo had been abandoned by his mother at age four, for being the son from a previous relationship. In 2005, Hans went to the Carabineros de Chile to get his mother's address, but when he went to meet her, he was chased away with a knife by his stepbrother. As a child, he went through several orphanages until one of his uncles, Francisco Pozo, began to take care of him, however, when he was 16, Pozo began to take drugs and ended up on the street, as his family couldn't endure his continuous robberies which were to fuel his addiction to cocaine paste.  The prime suspect  Days before the murdered, Hans Pozo spent the night with four men at a shelter at Paradero 30 on Santa Rosa Avenue. When they were separately interviewed by the Homicide Squad, all mentioned the surname \\"Mart√≠nez\\". Thanks to forensic entomology carried out by the Carabineros' Criminalistics Laboratory, the authorities were able to determine that the killer had refrigerated the remains before dumping them in various areas around the city. According to the researchers, the fly larvae present in Pozo's remains had the same level of development. Furthermore, due to the size of the victim's body, it was deduced that it couldn't have been kept in a domestic refrigerator, but an industrial one. This led the investigators to 41-year-old Jorge Iv√°n Mart√≠nez Ar√©valo, an official from La Pintana and owner of an ice cream parlor located next to his home, also at Paradero 30 in Santa Rosa. When the authorities went to Mart√≠nez's house for questioning, he was not there, so he was summoned to testify. At the same time, the prosecutor in charge of the case, Pablo Sabaj, gave the order to the OS9 group to investigate further. On the afternoon of April 8, 2006, the OS9 operatives entered the Mart√≠nez ice cream parlor for a routine interview. According to the Carabineros, upon hearing them enter, the suspect ran to his bedroom, screamed for a couple seconds and committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. This version was refuted by Mart√≠nez's relatives, especially his brother and colleague, Robinson, who claimed that the Carabineros entered the house and shot Jorge twice. After Mart√≠nez's death, his wife found a twenty-page suicide note at his home, in which he explained the type of relationship he had with Hans Pozo. In the note, Mart√≠nez claimed that Pozo was extorting him because he was his biological son and constantly threatened with revealing the secret to his family. According to Jorge, to avoid this, he contacted two police officials - who were never identified - who, in exchange for money, would intimidate Hans by jailing him for some time. However, when he saw the news about the \\"Dismembered of Puente Alto\\", Mart√≠nez knew that it was Pozo, seeing himself involved in a bigger problem. He also admitted his cowardice and his intention to \\"disappear\\". What triggered him to write the note was an alleged extortion by the hired killers, who were demanding more money from him for their work. Mart√≠nez constantly gave Pozo money in the face of his threats. He believed that Hans was his son, because in 1984, he had a brief relationship with a blonde woman. However, after his death, a DNA paternity test was performed and ruled out any relation between the two men. On May 3, 2006, the OS9 group collected biological samples from Mart√≠nez's ice cream parlor. There, using luminol, a blood stain that had been washed off was detected. The stain corresponded to Pozo, and by its shape, it was deduced that the corpse had been in that place after being shot. Later, Mart√≠nez's brothers, after questioned by prosecutor Sabaj, assured the press that they themselves were wounded once and that the blood was theirs. They also denounced the Carabineros, claiming that they tried to implicate them in Pozo's death, which they flatly denied. More blood samples were found in Mart√≠nez's van, specifically in the passenger seat and the back seat, which also belonged to Pozo.  Funeral  On Friday, April 14, 2006, the Legal Medical Service delivered Hans Pozo's remains to his adoptive family, who organized a wake for him at the \\"La Casona\\", in La Pintana. The next day, some three hundred people accompanied him at his funeral, which ended at the Jardin Sacramental cemetery in San Bernardo. On May 5, 2006, Pozo's ex-partner and mother of his daughter filed a complaint in the Puente Alto Court against those who were responsible for leaking his case file, including twelve images of Pozo's dismembered body, which were circulated on the internet via chain emails.  Outcome  In 2007, the South Prosecutor's Office concluded that Jorge Mart√≠nez Ar√©valo was guilty of the murder and subsequent dismemberment of Hans Pozo. For his part, Mart√≠nez's family insisted that the man did not commit suicide, but was shot by the Carabineros. However, the Second Santiago Military court later established that his death was due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound. In March of that year, Pozo's ex-partner, Linda Baeza, filed a complaint against Miguel Mart√≠nez Ar√©valo, Jorge's brother, on the grounds that he was also involved in the crime. On April 18, 2013, the prosecutor in charge of the case, Pablo Sabaj, requested the dismissal of the case, which was granted by the Puente Alto Guarantee Court. This decision was made because during the seven years of investigation, it was never verified that Jorge had acted with the help of a third party. In April 2016, Jorge Mart√≠nez's widow filed an appeal for protection in the San Miguel Court of Appeals to order the cessation of reports and audiovisual publications, both for her and her daughter, and for all the information relating to the Hans Pozo case. This legal action, which is protected by the right to be forgotten, was specifically aimed at free-to- air television channels.  Legacy  Hans Pozo's case inspired some literary works, such as 'Pozo' and 'Sin El Rucio: Keys to the crime of Hans Pozo', both published in 2007. The playwright Luis Barrales Guzm√°n premired his play 'H.P. (Hans Pozo)' in 2007, which received the 'Best Literary Work' award from the municipality of Santiago and the National Council for Books and Reading. Also in 2007, visual artist Felipe Santander presented his work Hilvanado at Galer√≠a Bech, which included a series of compositions made of synthetic leather and other materials that represented different scenes from the life of Hans Pozo. In 2009, the docufiction 'El Rucio, the story of Hans Pozo' was released, with actor Julio C√©sar Serrano playing the role of Pozo. In 2018, the Chilean poet Clemente Riedemann published the book 'Riedemann Blues', which contains a poem titled 'Hans Pozo blues'. In Puente Alto, near Marta Brunet, where some of Pozo's remains were found, people moved by his story erected a small animita to venerate him. Over time, some followers of Hans Pozo began to attribute miracles to him, for which reason various gifts and offerings in gratitude are given at the animita.

The festival also promoted art installations, performers and all events were held in garden styled locations. The lineup featured international and Australian music acts, from various genres including alternative rock, indie rock, indie folk and shoe-gaze.

The Eels also leaked their inclusion on the festival ahead of the official announcement. On 26 June 2013 it was revealed that Soundwave Touring was having possible issues locking in a Sydney venue due to conflicts with the government. The first lineup announcement was made on 28 June 2013. with a second announcement on 21 August 2012. Tickets went on public sale on 28 June 2012. On 9 September 2013, AJ Maddah released a series of comments on Twitter raising concern that the future of the festival could be in doubt, blaming \\"lack of interest\\" and Big Day Out festival for a lack of available bands to book as their festival started to shift into a more \\"Harvest-centric line-up\\". The future of the festival was put into uncertaintly when AJ Maddah expressed on 12 September 2013 \\"that pressing ahead with the event is ‚Äútoo risky‚Äù and is making other arrangements to salvage Australian appearances by the acts featured on the already announced bill\\". A second announcement had been planned, but ticket sales were low with \\"the promoter telling Fairfax that just 18% of the 17,500 tickets for Harvest‚Äôs Brisbane event had been sold, and around 30-40% of the 20,000 tickets for Sydney.

Black Rebel Motorcycle Club announced that the festival had been cancelled ahead of any confirmation from Soundwave Touring. In the next few hours, it was announced that AJ Maddah had bought a part share in the competition, the Big Day Out festival, announced that the festival looked to be 99% cancelled, then a few hours later he announced via Twitter that the 2013 festival had been officially cancelled. Many of the bands on the lineup would be rebooked for their own individual shows or would be moved to the Soundwave or Big Day Out lineups where appropriate. In 2014, AJ Maddah put any possible rumours to rest that Harvest would return in 2014 The remaining two festivals that AJ Maddah was involved in running also were cancelled in the next few years, Big Day Out was cancelled in 2014 and Soundwave in 2016. = Locations = * Werribee Park, Melbourne, 10 November 2013 * The Domain, Sydney, 16 November 2013 * City Botanic Gardens, Brisbane, 17 November 2013 = Lineup (First Announcement) = References  Category:2011 concert tours Category:2012 concert tours Category:Music festivals established in 2011 Category:Music festivals disestablished in 2013 Category:Music festivals in Australia ","title":"Harvest (music festival)"},{"id":"64021478","text":"Josep Nin i Tud√≥ (date unknown) Daoiz and Valarde Josep Nin i Tud√≥ (20 August 1843, El Vendrell - March 1908, Madrid)Obituary, Notas de Arte, Online was a Catalan painter.

Overseen by E.Y. Ponder and his younger brother, Zeno Ponder, it dominated politics in the county, particularly in the Democratic Party, from the 1950s until the 1980s.  Background  Madison County = Madison County, North Carolina was formed in 1851. The county was politically dominated by the Republican Party, and eventually hosted an entrenched Republican political machine. Between 1851 and 1950 the office of Sheriff of Madison County was always held by a Republican, except for a single member of the Democratic Party that was elected to one term in 1932. = Ponder brothers = Zeno Ponder and Elymas Yates \\"E. Y.\\" Ponder‚Äîthe latter older than the former by 11 years‚Äîwere brothers who grew up in a predominantly Republican family on a farm in Madison County. After earning a university degree in soil chemistry, Zeno worked for the United States government on the Manhattan Project during World War II. In the late 1940s he returned to Madison County and began teaching classes provided for by the G.I. Bill for returning war veterans. In these classes Ponder began to espouse his political beliefs, particularly promoting the desire for a strong Democratic presence in Madison County. He had been inspired by Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal agenda, and also stated that since the North Carolina General Assembly was long dominated by Democrats, Madison County would need a solid Democratic base to attract appropriations for public works and development. After complaints were made by the local Republican Party about the politicization of Zeno's classes, the government suspended them. = 1950 Madison County Sheriff election = In 1950 Zeno Ponder was appointed precinct registrar for the upcoming elections. He then set about aggressively registering local voters with the Democratic Party. That year E. Y. Ponder ran for the office of sheriff as a Democrat, challenging the Republican incumbent, Hubert Davis. In the November 7 election Ponder was declared the winner by 31 votes. Davis disputed the results, alleging electoral fraud. Backed by his sheriff's deputies, he refused to vacate the office. Ponder filed a lawsuit in the North Carolina Superior Court to have his victory confirmed. On December 4, both men were sworn into a term of office by different court officers. Denied access to the courthouse facilities, Ponder created an office in the Madison County Jail. While the results were disputed, a \\"Republican jail\\" was maintained in opposition to the \\"Democratic jail\\". Republicans placed a machine gun outside their jail, and Democrats would drive by at night and throw firecrackers to frighten them. In early January 1951 the Superior Court ruled in Ponder's favor and ordered Davis to vacate his post. Davis appealed the case to the North Carolina Supreme Court, which affirmed the previous ruling on November 1. Even after the dispute was settled, Ponder kept the sheriff's office in the jail.  Style and function  As sheriff, E. Y. Ponder wore a suit instead of a khaki law enforcement uniform and rarely carried a gun. He was well known in the county and relatively popular with local residents. He maintained a wide network of informants to gather information regarding criminal cases. He was generally lenient towards local offenders who voted for the Democratic Party, but pursued more aggressive action against outsiders. In contrast to E. Y., Zeno Ponder had a harsher reputation, and often carried a gun with him. By his own account, he and a Democratic registrar once had an armed standoff with four Republicans at a voting precinct. He served as secretary of the Madison County Democratic Executive Committee. Zeno never held elective public office, but served as the appointed chairman of the Madison County School Board from 1954 to 1966 and was chairman of the Madison County Board of Elections for a time. In the 1980s he served as the superintendent of Madison County Schools. According to a former operative in the Ponders' political machine, every election operatives would deliver two ballots boxes to each voting precinct, one empty and the other full of pre-marked ballots. After voting, the operatives would take the boxes to the courthouse and alter the contents of the boxes of official results in favor of their preferred candidate. According to a western North Carolina district attorney, Zeno Ponder and his operatives would go to local graveyards and take names off of the tombstones so ballots could be filled out in their name. Jokes about such \\"graveyard voting\\" in the county were frequent in North Carolina at the time. In a 1984 interview Zeno denied having ever participated in ballot box tampering but said, \\"I'd be the last to pretend all my friends are saints. I'm not that stupid‚Äîto think anybody would believe me.\\" Members of the machine assumed posts on county governance boards, allowing the organization to control patronage via the disbursement of jobs and funds. The Ponder brothers collected kickbacks from county school teachers. Republican Dedrick Brown, who later succeed Ponder as Sheriff of Madison County, alleged \\"If anybody wanted on food stamps or welfare or a job in the county they had control of‚Äîeven state jobs at that time‚Äîhe would go through the sheriff and he could put you on or take you off.\\"  History  Early history = In 1954 Zeno Ponder was appointed by the General Assembly to chair the Madison County Board of Elections. In that capacity, he dismissed and replaced all of the local registrars and election judges. Contrary to longstanding custom, he ignored the Republican Party's recommended appointees for precinct offices and instead appointed Republicans who were more agreeable to his own policy preferences. That year a Republican poll monitor was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill Zeno Ponder. Zeno left the elections board in 1956. The following year the Ponder brothers were arrested and charged with altering the contents of ballot boxes during a 1954 election. United States Attorney James M. Baley Jr. reported that he had collected more than 200 allegations of people being bribed for their vote and ballots being improperly notarized. The Ponders were tried in federal court before an all-Democratic jury, which found them not guilty. In the 1960 United States presidential election, John F. Kennedy became the first Democrat to earn a majority of votes in Madison County in a presidential election since 1876. That same year a statewide bond referendum was defeated in North Carolina by fewer than 3,000 votes, a margin within which the number of votes in Madison County proved decisive. North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Bill Cobb wrote a letter to the governor, accusing Zeno of altering Madison County's returns, and forwarded the letter to several news outlets. Zeno sued Cobb for libel. A jury initially found in Zeno's favor, but on appeal the State Supreme Court overturned the jury's finding and ordered a new trial. The second civil trial failed to materialize after Cobb became enveloped by a personal political scandal. In November 1962 a Republican poll monitor accused Zeno Ponder of pulling a gun on him during an argument at a voting precinct. Zeno admitted to drawing a gun but maintained that he only set it on the table and did not threaten the monitor. The Mayor of Marshall cleared Ponder of any wrongdoing. = 1964 elections = In 1964 the Ponder brothers agreed to back John Jordan Jr. in the Democratic primary election for the office of Lieutenant Governor. Another candidate, Robert W. Scott, traveled to the mountains and convinced Zeno to support him. Zeno then called Jordan, telling him, \\"I'm going to give you a few votes, but I can't give you the county.\\" Scott subsequently won the county by a large margin. Simultaneously, Zeno ran for a seat in the North Carolina Senate. On the day of the Democratic primary election, anti-Ponder Democrats marched into Marshall carrying signs saying \\"Save our schools from crooked politics.\\" That evening a brawl broke out at the Mars Hill polling place between anti-Ponder Democrats and E.Y. Ponder's sheriff's deputies after the former questioned the voting procedures following the discovery of an \\"extra\\" ballot box in a closet filled with ballots marked for Ponder. Zeno was declared the winner of the primary. His opponent, Clyde Norton, decried the results as marred by irregularities and called upon the State Board of Elections to initiate an investigation. The board subsequently complied. When the State Bureau of Investigation attempted to examine Madison County's poll books, the records went missing and were never found. The person who had last handled the books also disappeared. The board also impounded the county's ballot boxes, but 23 of them were unable to be found. The board ultimately overturned the results of the senate primary, citing irregularities, and dismissed three members of the county board of elections. Norton won the primary runoff election. In that year's general elections Republicans won a large number of county offices. E.Y. Ponder lost reelection as sheriff to Roy Roberts, a Republican. In the same election, Liston B. Ramsey, a Democrat and staunch ally of Zeno, lost his bid for reelection to his seat in the North Carolina House of Representatives to a Republican, F. Crafton Ramsey. The Ponders thus had no direct representation in state government, but Zeno dispatched Liston Ramsey to Raleigh, the state capital, anyway to take up residence while the General Assembly was in session. Ramsey quickly formed a bloc with fellow Democrats from mountain counties, including Representatives Mark Bennet and J. Thurston Arledge, to represent his concerns in state government. The group worked together to prevent changes to state procedure for jury selection that would allow for bipartisan input, as the under the existing system jury selection in Madison County was controlled by a single Democratic official. In May 1965 Crafton Ramsey proposed a bill in the House that would unseat the all- Democratic school board chaired by Zeno and replace it with a new board including Republican representation in preparation for its transformation into a non-partisan body. The bill was rejected by the Democratic-dominated House Education Committee. = Later history = In 1966 a group of \\"reform\\" Democrats led by Joseph Huff challenged Zeno Ponder's dominance on the local Democratic Party committee. At the Democratic Party's county convention on May 14, the local committee chairman was absent, so Ponder ran the meeting even though that responsibility should have fallen to the vice chairwoman. Huff's group filed a complaint with the North Carolina Democratic Party's Credentials and Appeals Committee, bemoaning the impropriety of Zeno's chairmanship and accusing him of dismissing concerns about voting irregularities brought up at the convention. The state credentials committee ultimately ruled that party rules \\"were not followed in toto\\" but refrained from taking any action on the grounds that an intervention \\"would not materially affect the makeup\\" of the local committee. In November 1968 dynamite was placed along the fence along Zeno Ponder's property and detonated, damaging the fence and blowing out some windows of his house. Zeno told reporters that he thought a Republican was responsible. E.Y. Ponder regained the office of sheriff in 1970. In 1981 Zeno Ponder was elected chairman of the Madison County Democratic Executive Committee. That year Governor Jim Hunt appointed him to the State Board of Transportation. He was reelected county Democratic chairman in 1983. In the 1984 United States Senate election in North Carolina, Republican incumbent Jesse Helms expressed his fear that Zeno would shift the electoral outcome to the Democratic candidate's favor. The following year United States Attorney Charles Brewer had him indicted for allegedly profiting off nonpublic information he gleaned from his position on the transportation board. Zeno attributed the federal legal proceedings against him to Helms, who he accused of maintaining a vendetta against him. A federal judge dismissed the charges, and two years later a Madison County Superior Court jury acquitted him on similar charges. = Decline = In the 1980s Republicans and anti-Ponder Democrats united to oust the Ponder machine. In 1986 E.Y. Ponder was challenged in his reelection bid by Dedrick Brown, a Republican and former sheriff's deputy who had lost to Ponder in 1970. A United States Marshal and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents established an outpost in a store owned by a Republican in Walnut to monitor the election. Voter turnout during the election was almost 75 percent, much higher than in previous years. Ponder ultimately lost to Brown by fewer than 400 votes. That December three Madison County public officials were dismissed, an action anti-Ponder locals attributed to the Ponder machine. In the late 1980s Brewer launched Project WestVote, an expansive federal investigation into voter fraud in western North Carolina. Anti-Ponder locals hoped the inquiry would remove the Ponder brothers' dominance from Madison County, while Zeno denounced it as a publicity stunt. Brewer started investigating the county in 1987 but left office before he could finish his work. In 1989 Brown arrested E. Y. Ponder after the latter shot and wounded a man he claimed attacked him in his yard. A Madison County grand jury subsequently decided not to indict him. Brown was one of the few Republicans to be reelected to a local office in 1990. Growing Republican electoral strength in the early 1990s greatly weakened the Ponders' political dominance.  Legacy  Zeno Ponder died in 1994. E. Y. Ponder died in 2001. The Ponder machine was the most famous \\"courthouse machine\\" of its time in North Carolina. Despite its termination, Democratic politicians continued to dominate local offices in the following years, and members of the Ponder family held elected office. Democratic influence waned some in the 2000s, and Madison County's electorate has favored Republican presidential candidates since 1996.

It was initially reported as the first known Jupiter trojan asteroid to display cometary activity, but its classification as a Jupiter trojan was retracted after closer examination and a longer observation arc revealed its orbit to be unstable like a typical Jupiter family comet and implied that its position near the trojans is temporary.  Discovery  was discovered in images by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) at the Mauna Loa Observatory taken on 10 June 2019. Upon discovery, astronomers Alan Fitzsimmons and David Young at Queen's University Belfast suspected a faint coma around . Follow-up observations by the Las Cumbres Observatory in 11 and 13 June 2019 confirmed the cometary appearance of , which now had a more apparent coma and tail. Later observations by the ATLAS-MLO in April 2020 showed that still retained its cometary appearance, suggesting that it has been continuously active for almost a year. The discovery of 's cometary activity was announced in a press release by the University of Hawai ªi Institute for Astronomy on 20 May 2020, purporting it as the first known active Jupiter trojan, as it was discovered near Jupiter's Lagrangian point where the Greek camp trojans reside. However, upon closer examination of 's orbital dynamics by amateur astronomer Sam Deen, was found to be a Jupiter-family comet with a chaotic orbit instead of a Jupiter trojan.

Rao is also the Director of the Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine and is the principal investigator of the Rao Lab. Rao discovers novel ion channels and explores their roles in human health and disease. The Rao Lab identified the oncogenic role of SPCA2 in breast cancer through an aberrant method of signalling to calcium channels.  Early life and education  Rao was born in India. She pursued her undergraduate degree in Chemistry and Biology in 1980 at Mount Carmel College in Bangalore, India. Rao graduated with a Bachelors of Science in 1983. Rao then moved to the United States to conduct her graduate studies at the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York. Under the mentorship of Alan E. Senior, Rao explored the biochemistry of the alpha subunit of Escherichia Coli F1-ATPase enzyme. In her graduate work, Rao discovered that three catalytic sites in the ATPase enzyme needed to interact to achieve maximal enzymatic rate and that this occurs in a cyclical mechanism. She later found that the binding of ATP to the alpha subunit of the F1-ATPase and the associated conformational changes are abolished when the Lysine-175 residue is mutated. Her work suggests a critical role for this specific residue on the nucleotide binding of ATP to the ATPase enzyme. Following the completion of her PhD in 1988, Rao pursued her postdoctoral work at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Rao worked under the mentorship of Carolyn Slayman to gain experience in the field of genetics. During her postdoctoral work, Rao was funded by an American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship from 1990 to 1991. Rao‚Äôs work explored the functions of the H+-ATPase in yeast. She used site directed mutagenesis to probe the role of specific amino acid residues in the function of the enzyme. Rao also developed a novel system with which to probe the function and structure of the H+ATPase. Since ATPases are essential for the survival of a cell, mutating them will lead to cell death and render the preparation difficult to study. In order to maintain wildtype expression of ATPases while studying the effects of certain mutations on ATPase function, Rao created a way to rapidly express the mutant ATPase in a secretory vesicle pool such that these vesicles could be isolated to study the catalytics of the enzyme. Rao found Following her postdoctoral work, Rao worked for one year as an Associate Research Scientist in the Department of Genetics at Yale University.  Career and research  In 1993, Rao was recruited to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine where she became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physiology. In 1998, Rao was promoted to Associate Professor and then in 2004, she became a Full Professor in the Department of Physiology. In 2008, Rao was promoted to Director of the Graduate Training Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine. Rao also acts as a faculty mentor within several other departments at Johns Hopkins and teaches several classes as well such as Pathways and Regulation, the Human Body, and Molecules and Cells. Rao is also a member of several national and international societies including the American Association of Science the Federation of American Society of Experimental Biology. As the Principal Investigator of the Rao Lab, Rao leads a research program focused on exploring the role of intracellular cation transport in health and disease. The lab uses yeast as a model organism with which to study the biology of cation transport channels. The specific transporters they focus on are H+-ATPases, Ca2+-ATPases, and Na+/H+ exchangers. The Rao Lab defined the secretory pathway Ca2+, Mn2+-ATPases (SPCA) and later discovered their roles in breast cancer development. A specific isoform of SPCA that is upregulated in breast cancer cells seemed to mediate aberrant calcium signalling, leading to increased calcium influx and promote tumorigenesis. = Cation transporters in neurological disease = After becoming the first to clone the endosomal Na+(K+)/H+ exchanger (eNHE) and recognize it as a separate exchanger from the plasma membrane NHE, the Rao Lab has begun to explore this exchanger in the context of neurological diseases such as autism. Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease, and glioblastoma. Since rare mutations in the NHE gene had been associated with autism, Rao probed the function of autism-associated variants of this transporter. Normally, the transporter mediates increased uptake of glutamate and stabilizes expression of the transferrin receptor and the GLAST transporter. However, the variants of the NHE in autism led to loss of function in the glial cells called astrocytes. Their finding highlighted the possibility of autism-associated mutations exerting their effects through loss of astrocyte function in the brain. The Rao Lab then discovered that NHE9 expression in glioblastoma is associated with poor clinical prognosis. NHE9 is an exchanger of Na+ and H+, and when blocked in glioblastoma it attenuates tumor growth and improves the efficacy of typical glioblastoma treatment, EGFR inhibitors. Cation channels have also been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease. The Rao Lab found in 2018 that defects in the NHE6 exchanger of Na+ and H+ led to defective clearance of amyloid beta by astrocytes. Through epigenetic modulation, they were able to restore the ability of NHE6 to maintain alkalinity in the endosome and this improved amyloid beta clearance by astrocytes.

An inner defence on the summit encloses ; outside this are defences built at later stages on the north and east side. Each are single ramparts of dry stone and earth; there are traces of a ditch outside the inner rampart.Christopher Houlder. Wales: An Archaeological Guide. Faber and Faber, 1978. Page 180. Within the inner defence are three stone cairns, regarded as Bronze Age burial mounds. In the fort there are at least 227 hut platforms. The remains represent a long period of occupation of the fort, and it is supposed that not all the dwellings were in use at the same time. Their builders evidently respected their Bronze Age predecessors, as the cairns were not plundered for the stone.

Most recently, he served as MD/CEO of Ambuja Cement. Prior to which he was CEO of Tata Steel UK. During the course of his tenure in Europe, Bimlendra was responsible for re-structuring several under-performing assets using his expertise in Theory of Constraints to turn them to profitability and eventually sell them off. Bimlendra came into the limelight in the U.K with several high-profile restructuring deals such as rescue and sale of British Steel (erstwhile Long Products Europe business of TSE) to Greybull Capital. The deal saved an estimated 5000 direct jobs for the struggling entity. Bimlendra was chosen to lead Tata Steel UK as its CEO in April 2016 to further restructure the business and stop it from bleeding a million pounds per day. In a ¬£100-million deal, Bimlendra hived off the specialty steel business to Liberty House and launched a transformation program called Delivering our Future for performance improvement in Port Talbort and its linked supply chain in the U.K. Even as the business stopped bleeding and turned positive on EBIDTA, Bimlendra was famously quoted by BBC Wales, ‚Äúwhether you drown one feet in water or ten feet, you still drown‚Äù. This is when he helped negotiate with the unions, a change in Britain's largest private pension scheme from defined benefits to defined contributions to de-risk the business, in a deal with the British Government that grabbed major headlines. In March 2020, Bimlendra founded IgnitingMinds Guru Pvt. Ltd and Mechi Enterprise.  Tata Steel  Bimlendra began his career at Tata Steel Limited as a Graduate Trainee in 1990. Early in his career, he held some key roles such as Chief of ASPIRE, Executive in Charge Tata Growth Shop, and Principle Executive officer to M.D. Tata Steel.  Tata Steel Europe  In 2013, Bimlendra moved to Europe and was appointed to the Executive Committee of the TSE to bring in fresh thinking at a strategic and tactical level by creating a role that combined Group Strategy and Supply Chain. The legacy of British Steel and Corus was a non-synergistic portfolio of products and businesses. Here, Bimlendra worked with Exco to shape portfolio restructuring options leading to possible strip focused JV with Thyssen Krupp Steel. In mid-2015, with mounting losses tata steel was faced with a tough decision of closing down the long products business in Europe putting at rick 5000 Jobs. Bimlendra volunteered to turn around the business and find a buyer by the end of the year. He was subsequently appointed, Executive Chairman of Longs Steel Europe. He turned around the business, taking some tough calls such as closing down the Plate operations and Coke ovens. In a mere seven months, the business returned to profitability. It was then successfully transferred to Greybull Capital in a ¬£1 deal and re-branded under the iconic British Steel name. In the summer of 2016, the steel industry in the UK faced a major existential crisis with insolvency announced by two major steel players and Tata Steel in the UK losing more than a million pounds a day. This threatened more than 18000 jobs in the UK subsidiary (circa ¬£4.5Bn turnover) and put a ¬£15Bn pension fund at risk. Following the successful turnaround of British Steel, in April 2016, Bimlendra was offered the role of CEO TS-UK, to save the business from insolvency. Here, he worked with Employees, Trade Unions, Government and suppliers to execute a massive turn around and portfolio restructuring program without losing a single customer, in a process that saved over 8000 jobs. He also de-risked the UK business from the valuation vagaries of a pension fund that has been restructured without hurting employees or the scheme's 130,000 pensioners.  Ambuja Cements  Bimlendra returned to India in February 2019 as MD & CEO Ambuja Cements Ltd. In a short span of 1 year, it turned around the business to have the second-highest EBITDA in a decade. Bimlendra also Launched 6 new products, introduced a new project management technique to initiate and speed up a new greenfield integrated plant site, and reduce the shutdown time below industry standards by a significant margin. He also introduced a highly successful influence management program and sales force incentive scheme, during the course of which some Ambuja plants broke their own record several times over.

In grattage various common tools scrape wet paint to simulate natural patterns or to create new ones.Marie MacDonnell Roberts, The artist's design: probing the hidden order, Fradema Press, 1993 The scratches created bring out the colors of the underlying pictorial layers and create chromatic contrasts. In the grattages, the scraping of the surface layers of paint over an assortment of objects serves to stimulate the mind to engage itself in the automatic process of ‚Äúdiscovering‚Äù images lying hidden within its innermost recesses.Haim Finkelstein, The Screen in Surrealist Art and Thought, Routledge, 2017  Artists  Max Ernst rediscovered the frottage technique (based on the rubbing principle); in 1927 he transposed this drawing technique - generally applied to paper - to oil painting, thus creating the grattage process.Max Ernst, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2005 Grattage allowed Max Ernst to free the creative forces full of suggestions and evocations, less theoretical and more unconscious and spontaneousUwe M.

Biography  Buor was born to the family of Marie-Fran√ßoise Marchand de la Mulni√®re, and of Fran√ßois-Andr√© Buor de La Charouli√®re. Buor joined the Navy as a Garde-Marine on 6 August 1756. He served on Duc de Bourgogne in 1756, on Z√©phyr in 1757, and later on √âveill√©, on which he took part in the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. In October 1764, he was promoted to Ensign and appointed to Utile, in which he took part in the Larache expedition. In 1776, Buor served on Prot√©e with a training cruise with the Escadre d'√©volution. He was promoted to Lieutenant on 4 April 1777. Buor captained the 80-gun Couronne, as flag captain to Guichen. He took part in the Battle of Martinique on 17 April 1780, as well as in the actions of 15 May and 19 May 1780. Buor returned to France in October 1780. On 9 May 1781, he was promoted to Captain and appointed to the command of the 80-gun Triomphant. In June, he transferred to the 110-gun Bretagne as Major d'escadre. In 1783, he married Marie-Marguerite-Charlotte Cairon de Merville. In 1786, Buor served as major d'escadre for the 12-ship Escadre d'√©volution, on the 74-gun Patriote, under Chef d'Escadre Albert de Rions. He was at Cherbourg when a naval review and a simulated naval battle took place as Louis XVI visited the harbour. That same year, Navy Minister Castries tasked Buor to write a treaty about naval tactics. Trait√© de tactique navale was published in 1787, drawing stiff criticism from De Thy. In 1790, Buor was given command of the 75-gun Orion. He retired with the rank of Contre-amiral on 1 January 1792. General Bonaparte requested his help to organise the French campaign in Egypt and Syria in 1798, but Buor's failing health prevented him from taking command. He died in poverty in Olonne on 2 April 1803.

It is located between Mapua and Motueka, 45km from Abel Tasman National Park and 40km from Nelson. The Tasman area covers a small peninsula on the southern and eastern side of the Moutere Inlet. It includes Kina Beach, a Tasman Bay beach with rock pools which is only fully accessible during low tide. The population of Tasman Village and Kina Beach is approximately 400. There is a general store, a medieval cafe, a vineyard, and a nine-hole golf course with views of Mt Arthur and Abel Tasman National Park.

Country singer-songwriter Aly Cook and four- time adventure racing world champion Nathan Fa'avae were both raised in Tasman. A Harley Davidson motorbike group, Sons of Tasman, also originates from Tasman. At the annual Muddy Buddy event, attendees in fancy dress get caked in mud from the inlet and are then cleaned off with fire hoses. History Tasman was originally named Aporo (the MƒÅori word for apple), but was renamed in 1906 after Dutch explorer Abel Tasman. The economy was originally based around orchards, but is increasingly based on arts, crafts, vineyards and tourism. In March 2018, work began on a new 96-lot housing development south of the main village. Landowner Alan Trent, an American businessman, had originally proposed a development with 130 resident sections, 55 apartments, shops, a village plaza, open space, and lifestyle farmland. The plans were scaled back due to community opposition. Trent had put his nearby home on the market for $8.9 million in January 2016. In December 2018, a local landowner sought planning approval for a small industrial development next to the village. Some residents opposed it, arguing it would affect the village's \\"rural charm\\". Education Tasman School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of .

He took over 150 acres in 1872, and was clearing, sowing and farming most of it by 1905. * Rueben Pakard, who moved to the area with his parents a few years later, also took up 150 acres, which he cleared for sheep and beef farming. * Joseph Packard was born in Suffolk, England in 1826 and was the oldest early settler. He originally purchased a 50 acre block, before taking a 300 acre block which he used to graze a few cows and sheep and plant about 300 lemon trees. * Thomas Harwood, who was born at sea to parents from Yeovil in Somersetshire, England, purchased 235 acres of forested limetone land in 1868, which he began clearing and farming 1876. He initially farmed cattle, but transitioned by sheep farming in the early 20th century. By 1905, he had cleared and cultivated about 130 acres of the property.

She mainly painted scenes of rural life in Portugal. Background Susanna Roope Dockery was born in Porto, the daughter of Cabel Roope, who came from Dartmouth in England and Elizabeth Whitaker. He was a partner in Hunt, Roope, Teage and Co., of Porto (or ‚ÄúOporto‚Äù as it was then widely known by the English), which was an important company that both imported salted codfish from Newfoundland and exported wines to the United Kingdom. Watercolour of wheat threshing by Susanna Roope Dockery While marriage between the English families of Porto was common, Roope chose to marry Alfred Victor Dockery, the United States Consul in Porto between 1873 and 1876. He was transferred to Leeds, England, where the couple married in 1878. They had three children. Dockery, who was born in 1851 in North Carolina, came from a prominent family of plantation owners. He owed his diplomatic career after the American Civil War to the family‚Äôs support of the Republican Party, but when the Democrats took over the presidency in 1885 he was forced to return to the USA. He did not take his family with him. Apparently lacking financial support from her husband, Susanna Roope Dockery, returning to Portugal, became for a time dependent on her extended family and friends. To earn some money, she took up watercolour painting as a profession. Her paintings were of the Porto area and she also took a small cottage at Afife to the north of Porto in what is now the municipality of Viana do Castelo. Many of her works feature the stone buildings and bridges of that area. Initially she sold her paintings to British people in Porto and some are still to be found in the houses of Anglo- Portuguese families. The favourable reception of her work encouraged her to seek a wider audience and in February 1897 she exhibited \\"76 Watercolour drawings of North Portugal\\" at a gallery in London's Mayfair. In 1889 her watercolours of Costumes of Minho and Douro were exhibited in Lisbon and two of the paintings were purchased by the Queen. In 1901 she exhibited at the Royal Academy and she continued to exhibit at commercial galleries in London. Although it is not known for sure, the development of Dockery‚Äôs painting skills may have been as the result of her visits to her mother‚Äôs house in Witley to the southwest of London. This village was home to artists such as Myles Birket Foster and Helen Allingham. It is also known that she received some tuition from the Irish artist, Claude Hayes. In 1909, 21 of her painting were chosen to illustrate a book by W.H. Koebel, entitled Portugal, Its Land and People. The book was reprinted in 2010.An exhibition of her paintings was held in London, timed to coincide with the original publication of the book. From 1911, Roope Dockery experienced a series of tragedies. In that year both her brothers died and in the following year her elder son succumbed to tuberculosis. Her younger son, who had emigrated to Africa to be a farmer, died in mysterious circumstances a decade later. She was to die in September 1927.

After the Indonesian independence, he was appointed as the member of the People's Representative Council of North Sumatra, .  Early life Harahap was born on 15 July 1905 in Sarolangun, Jambi. He was born as the son of Mangaradja Gading, a Bataknese civil employee. He was the second child of the six children his parents had. After Harahap's birth, Mangaradja Gading moved to the Jambi city. In the city, Mangaradja Gading enlisted Harahap to the Europeesche Lagere School (ELS, European Primary School) in 1914, to follow his older brother that had already study there. He only studied for two years there, as his father was transferred to the city of Sibolga in 1916. In Sibolga, Mangaradja Gading was still employed as a civil employee, but with a higher rank. Abdul Hakim continued his ELS at Sibolga. He graduated from the school in 1920, and continued studying at the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (literally Extensive Primary Education, equal to Junior High School). He graduated from the school in 1924, and went to the Prins Hendrikschool (Prince Hendrik School, high school for economy) until 1926. During this time, he was involved in the nationalist movements in the Dutch East Indies, such as Jong Islamieten Bond (Young Islamic Association), Jong Batak (Young Bataks) and Jong Sumatra Bond (Young Sumatran Association).  In the Dutch East Indies After his graduation from the Prins Hendrikschool, he briefly took a course about customs and excises. After completing the course, in 1927, he was employed at the customs and excises office in Medan. During his time in Medan, he stood as the candidate for the alderman of the MedanGementeraad (municipal assembly) election in 1930. He was elected to the council, obtaining 131 votes out of 408. He was elected again in 1934, this time obtaining 365 votes. Alongside his job as an alderman of the Gementeraad, he opened French and English lessons. He also contributed to the funding of several central markets and public hospitals. He resigned from the position in 1937, after being transferred to Batavia to work as a functionary in the Department of Finance. In Batavia, he met with his old colleagues from the Jong Batak organization. They discussed how their homeland in North Sumatra, Tapanuli, was less developed than East Sumatra, due to the Bataks living in Tapanuli opted to start their career in Medan, East Sumatra. Thus, the Committee for the Development of Tapanuli was set up, with Harahap being one of its members. In 1941, due to the oncoming Japanese threat to the Dutch East Indies, Harahap was appointed as the deputy head of the financial department in Pontianak. He was moved to Makassar 6 months later with the same position.  During the Japanese occupation  After the Japanese occupation, he was still employed by the Japanese in his previous position, only with a different name. The Department of Finance has changed the name to the Kosei Kyoku and Kaikeikyoku (Bureau of Welfare and Finance). Due to his proficient job, he was transferred to Tarutung, the capital of Tapanuli, as the secretary of the Tapanuli Council.  Indonesian National Revolution  After the independence of Indonesia, he joined the Masyumi Party. Shortly after, he was appointed by the Resident of Tapanuli, Ferdinand Lumbantobing, as the deputy resident of Tapanuli. He was tasked by Lumbantobing to handle political and economic task. In his capacity, he began printing the \\"Money of the Republic of Indonesia for Tapanuli\\" (ORITA, Oeang Republik Indonesia Tapanoeli) as a way to maintain financial stability in the residency. The money was printed by hand, but the signature was manually signed. Initially, Harahap himself signed the money, but after being tired of signing all of the money, he tasked his aide with the job. Due to the successful monetary system that Harahap has created, Mohammad Hatta, the vice president of Indonesia, appointed him as the resident of Riau. As there was no running government in Riau, he refused the appoinment, stating that he \\"didn't want to govern a place without any government\\". Hatta threatened to remove Harahap from his position if he didn't accepted the appointment. He still didn't accepted the appointment, so he was removed from the position. After the removal, he was chosen as the member of the Central Indonesian National Committee, representing Sumatra. He went to Jakarta to attend the Central Indonesian National Committee session in Malang. He returned to Tapanuli after attending the session. On 12 December 1948, Harahap was inaugurated as one of the 45 members of the People's Representative Council of North Sumatra. During the Round Table Conference, Harahap was appointed as one of the general advisor to the Indonesian delegates.  Deputy Prime Minister of Indonesia  On 22 January 1950, Harahap was inaugurated as the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Indonesia in the Halim Cabinet. During his tenure, he was involved in the dissolution of the United States of Indonesia and restore the unitary state. In his statement on 8 May 1950, he pointed out that the Republic of Indonesia must led the dissolution process and that all of the other federal states shall bear the results of the dissolution. The cabinet resigned after the formal dissolution of the United States of Indonesia on 15 August 1950.  Ambassador of Indonesia to Pakistan  On 28 October 1950, he was appointed by the president as the ambassador of Indonesia to Pakistan, replacing the late Syamsuddin.  Governor of North Sumatra  On 25 January 1951, Harahap was inaugurated as the Governor of North Sumatra by Makmun Sumadipradja, representing the Minister of Internal Affairs, Assaat. He was the first definitive governor of North Sumatra, after the abolishment of the post and the appointment of Sarimin Reksodihardjo as the acting governor. = Work trip and problems = Shortly after his inauguration, he went on a work trip around North Sumatra. Between January and February 1950, he went to Aceh and Tapanuli. In Aceh, Harahap faced problems regarding to the irrigations, education, transportation, and health affairs. He also heard several demands from the Achense people who wants autonomy in the region. After his work trip, he began improving the government system in North Sumatra. He appointed several coordinating residents for Aceh and Tapanuli, while the coordinating resident for East Sumatra is seated in the governor's office. He refused to continue the agrarian program enacted by the previous governor, Sarimin Reksodihardjo, by stating that \\"agrarian affairs is handled by the central government\\". He also faced problems about labor force and veteran, both of which complained that they weren't being treated by the government. = Constructions = To repair the post-war condition of North Sumatra, the government began to build institutions aimed to improve standard of living. In 1951, Abdul Hakim began the construction of the Teladan Stadium, which was eventually finished in 1953. He also established several universities in North Sumatra, namely the University of North Sumatra and the Indonesian Islamic College.  Later life  Harahap participated in the 1955 Indonesian legislative election. He was elected as the member of the People's Representative Council from North Sumatra, representing Masyumi. After the council was dissolved in 1959, he was appointed as the member of the transitional People's Representative Council, until the council was dissolved on 24 June 1960.

It is a system of self-defense and personal development rooted in South Asian heritage. Butthan has been developed by Mak Yuree, an internationally acclaimed Grandmaster and known as Superhuman as dubbed by the Discovery Channel. It has been described as the ‚Äònoble art of stopping-fight and enlightenment that produces physical, mental and spiritual balance‚Äô. Butthan was approved as a national sport of Bangladesh by the National Sports Council, Ministry of Youth and Sports in Bangladesh in 2013. As a combat sport, the martial art is practiced in different parts of the world under the International Butthan Federation. History The word Butthan is a Sanskrit word, meaning upliftment or defense with distinction. Butthan, as a form of martial art rooted in ancient South Asia, was founded by Grandmaster Mak Yuree. The Pashupati seal was found as the world‚Äôs oldest evidence of body-mind training in the archeological site of Mohenjo-daro. The systematic form of martial art was developed in ancient India. Indian monk Bodhidharma traveled from Kanchipuram to Shaolin Temple in 520 AD. The systematic forms of self-defenses were later nourished at Shaolin Monastery. Bodhidharma introduced rich psycho-physical training to the Shaolin monks which was vital in strengthening the internal and external organs. However, over the centuries the Indus valley civilization lost its heritage as the thriving ground for martial arts. After two and half millennia, Mak Yuree Vajramuneethe, with his research and development, created an international movement to revive that heritage of martial arts under the flag of Butthan. The practice of Butthan began in 1981 in the Bangladeshi city of Rajshahi. In 1985, under the guidance of Mak Yuree, the first national-level Butthan competition in Bangladesh took place at Rajshahi Government College. Butthan evolved through Mak Yuree‚Äôs accomplishment in forty different Martial arts styles and progressive research and development. Butthan was spread across Bangladesh with the formation of training camps in different districts of the country. At the beginning of 1990s, Butthan was adopted by different law- enforcement and security organizations in Bangladesh, such as Special Security Force, National Security Intelligence, Army, Police, RAB, Cost Guard, United Nations Peace Keeping Force as a way to train their law enforcement personnel. In 1991, Burmese Grandmaster Khing Maung Gyi presented a successorship document containing the overview of Bando, a Burmese form of martial art, in Dhaka. At the ceremony, Butthan was showcased by Bangladeshi martial artists. The event was publicized through mainstream media. In 1992, American army official Frank White took the initiative to spread Butthan beyond the map of Bangladesh. In 1994, Butthan was introduced as mandatory physical training in all the cadet colleges in Bangladesh. Andy Scott, a trainer at the National Security Academy of Texas, USA, supported the spread of the martial art in the USA. In an effort to spread Butthan around the world, World Butthan Federation was formed in 1998 in Houston, United States. The organization was renamed to International Butthan Federation in 2002 in a conference attended by Butthan trainers and advisors in England. Internation Butthan Federation promotes the martial art in South East Asia, Europe and the United States. Myanmar Thaing Federation, in 2004, honored the founder of Butthan Mak Yuree in a reception, which was attended by 32 Grandmasters of the country. In the reception, Myanmar proclaimed its solidarity with the global Butthan movement. Mak Yuree traveled to Swindon, England in 2005 in the pursuit of spreading Butthan. The mayor of Swindon, Steve Wakefield received training of Butthan and helped in the promotion of Butthan. In 2007, World Martial Arts Hall of Fame recognized Mak Yuree as the ‚ÄòGrandmaster of the Year‚Äô. Combat, a magazine on martial art from United Kingdom, published a cover story based on Mak Yuree, which helped Butthan to garner attention globally in martial arts circle. The then editor of the magazine, Paul Cliffton sincerely supported the publicity and spread of Butthan. Furthermore, Darique Montaut, a politician of Swindon, actively supported the spread of Butthan in England. In 2010, International Butthan Federation participated with promotional stall in the International Martial Art Exhibition held at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, England. Butthan was approved as a national sport by the National Sports Council, Ministry of Youth and Sports in Bangladesh in 2013. In 2015, Martial Art Illustrator published its cover story based on Butthan. Brunei Darussalam government officially approved practice of Butthan nationally in their country in April, 2018. Philosophy and overview Butthan, as a form of martial art, is a realistic system of self-defense, personal development and modern form of safe sport with South Asian heritage. It aims to transform the human body through balance of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual spheres and thereby attaining self-mastery and beyond. Butthan characterizes 'Co- competition' system to depict the non-aggressive, cooperation-based path of empowerment. The sport is based on cooperation, empathy, personal development and positive motivation. Butthan emphasizes mindfulness training and conscious use of mind to activate the physical movement, thereby maximizing the efficiency and delivery of power which is known as Mon-Chala. The practice of the martial art produces balance through a process of inculcating self- discipline and pragmatic restructuring of personal habits known as Vaz-Sodhon. Butthan also uniquely stages a mental test as a part of the tournament rules to ensure the quality of participants‚Äô mental and physical prowess equally which is called Jhalak Khela. The system of Butthan has the essence of knowledge and scientific principles of psychology, trigonometry, human anatomy, physiology, logic, human nervous system, Vajra Pran, Siddha medical knowledge blended with selected self-defense methods combining the arts such as Bando, Vajra-mushti, Varma kalai, Tibetan and Chinese Kempo, Ming Jing, Bansahy, Lathi khela and other selected strategies of the ancient Indian, Burmese and Tibetan unarmed and weapons systems.

The Pregnancy Outcome Prediction (POP) Study is a prospective cohort study of 4,512 women that have never given birth recruited at the Rosie Hospital (Cambridge, UK) between January 2008 and July 2012.  Staff and funding  The Principal Investigator is Gordon Smith of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (University of Cambridge, UK). Lab work using the biobank of samples is led by Stephen Charnock-Jones of the same department. The POP study is supported by the Women‚Äôs Health and Paediatrics theme of the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), which is based at the Cambridge Biomedical Campus (UK). Other funding sources for the projects related to the POP study are the Medical Research Council (UK), the NIHR, the Wellcome Trust, the British Heart Foundation, and the Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society (Sands), as well as Industry supported studies. Background In 2007, Cambridge (UK) received funding from NIHR to establish a comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre (BRC). The Cambridge BRC Women‚Äôs Health and Paediatrics theme focuses on tackling the origins, treatment and prevention of many of the health issues that affect women during their reproductive years. The bulk of the Cambridge BRC funding for the first five years of the theme supported the POP study. Over recent years, we have witnessed a great improvement in population-based screening methods for fetal abnormalities as a result of technological developments in ultrasound, biochemical screening and molecular genetics. However, the methods for screening the low risk population for other complications of pregnancy such as fetal growth restriction (FGR), pre- eclampsia and stillbirth have remained largely unchanged for the past 20-30 years. The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has highlighted a number of research priorities in their guidelines for pregnancy care. These include a focus on improving the screening of apparently healthy pregnant women and identify those at high risk of complications. This area is the main focus of the POP study. 500x500px Design and aims Nulliparous women with a viable singleton pregnancy were recruited to the POP study when attending their dating ultrasound scan at The Rosie Hospital (Cambridge, UK). The only clinical exclusion criterion was multiple pregnancy. Participants had serial ultrasound scans and blood obtained at recruitment, 20, 28 and 36 weeks of gestation. DNA samples and height/weight measurements of the partners were also collected. After delivery, biopsies of the placenta, placental membranes, umbilical cord, and a sample of cord blood were collected. Thorough design of the POP study and careful sample collection allowed the creation of an extensive, optimally phenotyped biobank of complicated and healthy pregnancies, including approximately 230,000 blood and tissue samples stored in -80¬∞C freezers, 24,000 formalin fixed placental biopsies, and 4,000 paternal DNA samples. The types of samples collected during the POP study reflect, first of all, the focus on the role of the placenta and its altered development and function in several major complications of pregnancy. Second, they reflect the interest in circulating biomarkers since, despite years of intensive research, screening for these conditions is still largely based upon clinical grounds rather than ultrasonic and/or biochemical assessment of placental function. Therefore the projects based on the samples from the POP study have the following aims: 1) understanding the mechanisms leading to placentally-related complications, such as pre-eclampsia, FGR and stillbirth; 2) studying the association between pregnancy complications and the presence of infectious agents in the placenta; 3) evaluating the performance of known biomarkers and serial ultrasonography in assessing maternal and fetal well- being; 4) discovering novel, placentally-derived circulating biomarkers which reflect the underlying pathology and are highly sensitive and specific in predicting the associated disease. 700x700px  Key findings  Multiple projects based on this extremely valuable resource of data/specimens have been published and many are currently on-going. The key findings obtained so far studying the samples from the POP study are (see paragraph ‚ÄúResearch papers‚Äù for a complete list of publications): * Universal use of ultrasound to screen nulliparous women in the third trimester roughly triples the detection of small for gestational age (SGA) infants; moreover, combining ultrasound measurements of the estimated weight and of the growth velocity of a fetus identified a subset of small babies at increased risk of neonatal morbidity. * Maternal serum level of Delta-like homolog 1 (DLK1), protein involved in the regulation of maternal metabolic state and fetal growth in mice, differentiates constitutionally small and pathologically small (or fetal growth restricted) human fetuses. * Fetuses of mothers who developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) grow faster already before the time GDM was diagnosed (women are typically screened at 28 weeks of gestation), suggesting that screening for GDM should be performed earlier (at 24 weeks). * A predictive model using blinded ultrasound estimated fetal weight (EFW) at 36 weeks, maternal age, height, BMI and weight gain correctly identifies women at increased risk of emergency C-section: in this study 48% of screen-positive women delivered by C-section. * Third-trimester screening of nulliparous women by universal ultrasound fetal biometry increases the detection rate of large for gestational age (LGA) infants and, combined with ultrasound measurements of fetal growth velocity, identifies those at increased risk of adverse neonatal outcome. * A clinically useful screening test for pre-eclampsia and FGR combines placentally-derived proteins measured in the maternal serum (i.e. the ratio of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFLT1) to placental growth factor (PlGF)) and ultrasonic estimation of fetal weight. * The placenta exhibits a unique sex-dependent difference in polyamine metabolism, which is associated with placental-specific escape from X-chromosome inactivation by the enzyme spermine synthase (SMS); moreover, maternal serum levels of polyamine metabolites differ by fetal sex and strongly differentially associate with the great obstetrical syndromes, namely higher maternal serum levels of N1,N12-diacetylspermine (DiAcSpm) increases the risk of pre- eclampsia but decreases the risk of FGR. * A novel biomarker for pre- eclampsia, 4-hydroxyglutamate, improves current first-trimester prediction of the preterm disease. * Universal late-pregnancy ultrasound in nulliparous women could identify around 14,826 otherwise undiagnosed breech presentations across England annually and could, therefore, reduce emergency cesarean section and fetal mortality in breech presentation; moreover, it would be cost effective if fetal presentation could be assessed for less than ¬£19.80 per woman. * The human placenta does not have a microbiome and placental bacterial infection is not a common cause of adverse pregnancy outcome; however, the placenta is a potential site of perinatal acquisition of S. agalactiae (group B Streptococcus), a major cause of neonatal sepsis. * A maternal serum metabolite ratio predicts FGR at term and approximately doubles the discrimination capacity between cases and controls as compared to the sFLT1:PlGF ratio. * The presence of inherited, chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) DNA in the feto-placental unit is associated with an 2-3 fold increased risk of the mother to develop pre-eclampsia; moreover, this study did not identify any other viral associations with pre-eclampsia and FGR. To externally validate the POP study findings, some of the above projects also involved collaboration with investigators from the Born in Bradford study. Moreover, additional collaborations included the Cambridge University School of Biological Sciences (in particular, the Centre for Trophoblast Research, a major international centre for placental research including >20 research groups), the Cancer Research UK (CRUK) Cambridge Institut and the Wellcome Sanger Institute. These studies also benefited from collaborations with industrial partners such as GE Healthcare and Roche.

The first POP study generated a simple screening test which is strongly predictive for pre- eclampsia and FGR at term. The test combines maternal risk factors, ultrasound measurements and levels of placentally-derived proteins in maternal serum (sFlt-1:PlGF ratio). The goal of POPS2 is to collect similar data and samples from approximately 4,500 unselected nulliparous women to address the following aims: 1) to assess whether the test generated by the POP study works in an independent cohort; 2) to nest a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of screening and intervention within the cohort in order to evaluate whether pregnancy outcome can be improved by inducing labour early (from 37 weeks) in women who screen positive; 3) to collect more blood samples in order to develop and validate new predictive tests to detect a bigger proportion of pregnancy complications and to identify them earlier in pregnancy. Logo of the POPStar study. = POPStar = Pregnancy Outcome Prediction Study: transgenerational and adults review (POPStar) is a follow-up study of the original POP study, conducted by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in collaboration with the Department of Paediatrics (both University of Cambridge). The study is funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) and the children‚Äôs charity, Action Medical Research. POPStar looks at the long-term health and development of the children and the mothers of the POP study cohort. POPStar started in June 2020, when the children were between 8 and 12 year old. The study is based on the link between routinely-collected data (e.g. from the UK National Health Service and the Department for Education) and the results from POP study in order to determine which pregnancy parameters could predict a high risk of health or developmental problems. Using the existing and follow-up data collected during the POP and POPStar studies, the research team aims to make connections between conditions during pregnancy and current maternal and children health.

He left his native Holland at an early age and worked in Venice and Vienna. In the latter city where he likely lived the rest of his life, he was part of the circle of Dutch and Flemish artists with contacts to the Imperial court.

On 10 July of that year the painter Petrus Vignois addressed a petition to the Hof van Holland (Court of Holland, at that time the highest judicial authority in the Dutch Republic) from the jail in The Hague where he was locked up. In his petition Vignois recounts the events that had led to his arrest: on the evening of 25 August 1647 he and his fellow painters Hans de Jode, Carel Codde and Bartholomeus Appelman were strolling through The Hague when two men started following and harassing them. Despite the painters' entreaties for them to back off, they were forced to draw their swords. In the ensuing scuffle de Jode injured one of the men so badly that he died immediately. De Jode fled The Hague the same night. The three other painters stayed in The Hague until each of them set off on their study trip to Italy. The bailiff only started his proceedings against the foursome in 1653. Codde who was the only one who had come back to The Hague could quickly prove his innocence and was let go. The three others residing abroad were not even aware that proceedings had been commenced against them. Vignois was locked up upon his return from Italy in 1656. He mentions in his petition that it was believed that de Jode was at that moment residing in Venice or in Constantinople.Abraham Bredius (ed.), K√ºnstler-Inventare.

Here he is likely to have encountered both Johann Anton Eismann, a painter of marine and battle scenes from Salzburg and Joseph Heintz the Younger, a painter of mythological and religious scenes from Augsburg. He is assumed to have travelled on to Rome, the destination of most Netherlandish artists of his time. The influence of the painterly and dramatic style of the Rome-based artist Salvator Rosa on de Jode's work seems to support such visit to Rome. De Jode's landscapes further reprise motifs of the so-called Bamboccianti, a group of mainly Dutch and Flemish genre painters active in Rome who created small cabinet paintings of the everyday life of the lower classes in Rome and its countryside. Wide river view with bathers De Jode left Italy for Vienna no later than 1659, the year in which he painted the View of the Tip of the Seraglio with Topkapi Palace (Kunsthistorisches Museum). The next year de Jode worked along with Jan van Ossenbeeck and Nikolaus van Hoy on a publication documenting the stage set made for the premiere of Giovanni Francesca Marcello's play 'Il Pelope Geloso'.Miroslav Kindl, Die niederl√§ndischen K√ºnstler der zweiten H√§lfte des 17. Jahrhunderts in Diensten der F√ºrsten von Liechtenstein in Feldsberg (Valtice), in: Liechtensteinisch-Tschechische Historikerkommission (Hrsg.), 'Die Liechtenstein und die Kunst' Band 3, Vaduz, HWFL, 2014, pp. 172‚Äì173 The only lifetime record on de Jode was made on the occasion of his wedding with Elisabeth Gaillet on 8 January 1662 in the Schottenkirche (Scottish church) in Vienna. Witnesses at the wedding were two Flemish artists from Antwerp, the painter Jan de Herdt and the printmaker Franciscus van der Steen. Van der Steen had arrived in Vienna when Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria gave up his position as governor of the Spanish Netherlands and returned to Vienna in 1656. The presence of two Flemish artists at his wedding demonstrates that de Jode moved in the circle of Netherlandish artists who worked in Vienna, often on commissions of the imperial court. De Jode died not long after his marriage as no paintings by him dated after 1661 are known. Between 1677 and 1680 Prince Karl Eusebius, Prince of Liechtenstein, the founder of the Liechtenstein collections, acquired 11 paintings by de Jode for the picture gallery in his palace at Valtice in the South Moravian Region. Many of these sales were brokered by the Flemish landscape painter Renier Meganck from Brussels. Stylistic similarities between the works of Meganck and de Jode suggest that Meganck spent some time in the latter's workshop and possibly even took over de Jode's workshop after his death. Meganck clearly acted as de Jode's testamentary executioner. Work View of the Tip of the Seraglio with Topkapƒ± Palace De Jode was a specialist landscape painter who created marine paintings, harbour scenes and Italianate landscapes. His oeuvre reflects the ideas and motifs with which he familiarised himself during his residence in Italy. Johann Anton Eismann likely aroused in him an interest in marine painting while Joseph Heintz the Younger's use of dramatic lighting was influential on the use of light in his work. The painterly qualities and dramatic lighting in the work of the Salvator Rosa were further influences. The Bamboccianti painters with their representations of low-life scenes of every-day life amidst landscapes informed the choice of some of his paintings. The Dutch Italianate landscape painters such as Karel Dujardin or Nicolaes Berchem who created harbour views and Arcadian landscapes bathed in a warm southern light can also be found in de Jode's work. Fishermen by a waterfall Two of de Jode's signed landscapes now in the Castelvecchio Museum in Verona, which are dated 1657, clearly show the influence of these disparate inspirations. This is particularly marked in the Harbour scene with classical elements, where the Bamboccianti inspiration is evident in the staffage on the quay and the influence of Salvator Rosa and the Duch Arcadian landscape painters in the classical elements and towers.Hans de Jode, Marina con barche all'approdo e torrioni at Finarte auction of 20 May 2008 Milan lot 28 The Northern-European influence is also visible in the figures and his attention to the atmospheric rendering of the scene, in particular through the modulation of the light. His View of the Tip of the Seraglio with Topkapƒ± Palace (1659, Kunsthistorisches Museum) is regarded by some as evidence that he visited Constantinople in the 1650s. However, as his view includes certain inaccuracies it is more likely that he based the view on multiple sources, including prints, of the city which he conflated into his composition.

The course provided formal military education to senior officers who had not previously received it.  History  The predecessor to KUVNAS was the Military-Academic Course for Higher Command Personnel, established at the Military Academy of the Red Army (later renamed the Frunze Military Academy) in accordance with an order of the Revolutionary Military Council of 8 August 1921. The course, which had a nine-month training period, was disbanded by an order of 6 June 1924, which mentioned a need to develop a new academic course for senior officers. This was necessary because the origins of the Red Army in the Russian Revolution resulted in a large number of senior officers who had no formal military education or only junior officer training in the Imperial Russian Army. This group included all senior commanders except for those military specialists who had graduated from the Imperial General Staff Academy. The formation of the Course for the Improvement of Higher Command Personnel (KUVK) at the Military Academy of the Red Army, significantly expanded from its predecessor, was announced by an order of 12 August. The KUVK was merged with the Military-Political Academic Course (VPAK) on 11 May 1925 to become KUVNAS, which included military and political departments. A series of rapid changes followed as on 27 March 1926 the political department was split off and the course renamed the Course for the Improvement of Higher Command Personnel, but on 1 September 1928 the political course was merged again and the combined course became KUVNAS. The course was generally taught by graduates of the Imperial General Staff Academy. By 1928, 4.6% of Red Army officers had been educated at either KUVNAS or an academy. Economic and military mobilization departments were established in 1930. The course was disbanded in 1936 as a result of the creation of the Military Academy of the General Staff, which took over its role. In addition, the course had become redundant as the younger generals had already received military education through military schools and advanced courses. A KUVNAS with a seven-month training period was later established at the Military Academy of the General Staff in late 1940.

It was a strategic military road to supply the southern sector of the Eastern Front. The large scale constructions works started in early 1942 to support the German advance towards Stalingrad. It ran for over from Lviv east to Stalino (now Donetsk). Organisation Todt was responsible for the construction which was sub-contracted to several private construction firms. It was constructed by forced laborers ‚Äì Soviet prisoners of war, local civilians, and Jews ‚Äì who were procured by the SS and guarded by the Schutzmannschaft battalions. One of the largest forced labor projects undertaken by Nazi Germany that involved Jewish labor, it marked a transition between using Jews as forced laborers to the practice of \\"extermination through labour\\". Construction In December 1941, Heinrich Himmler inspected the southern sector of the Eastern Front and experienced poor road conditions first hand. He even had to cancel a meeting with Eberhard von Mackensen, commander of the III Army Corps as road conditions made it too difficult to reach the unit. Himmler quickly agreed that road improvement was a top priority. The planning for the road started in fall 1941. It was not a new road but a widening (to ) and modernization of a late 18th-century Russian road built by Catherine the Great. The planned road stretched approximately from Lviv in District of Galicia of the General Government via Ternopil, Letychiv, Vinnytsia, Haisyn, Uman, Kirovograd (now Kropyvnytskyi), Kryvyi Rih, Dnipropetrovsk (now Dnipro), Stalino (now Donetsk), and Taganrog to Rostov-on- Don in Russia. The road had two branches ‚Äì DG IVb from Lviv via Brody, Dubno to Rivne and DG IVc from Kirovograd via Oleksandriia, Kremenchuk to Poltava. At Vinnytsia, the road would intersect with the proposed Durchgangsstrasse V that would connect to Werwolf, F√ºhrer Headquarters, and go south up to Zhytomyr. There were further plans to extend the road into Caucasus as the Wehrmacht advanced further into Russia. The initial plans called for the road further south, but the plans were modified to avoid Transnistria Governorate controlled by the Romanian allies. When the project was discussed with Adolf Hitler, he insisted that the road be primitive and the surface should last only two to three years. Other projects undertaken under the auspices of DG IV included the repair of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station and building a bridge over the Kerch Strait and a bridge over the Southern Bug at Mykolaiv. In District of Galicia, SS and Police Leader Fritz Katzmann ordered Jews to work on the road in October 1941 (some photos of DG IV were included in the Katzmann Report of June 1943). Historians have proposed that when Reinhard Heydrich made a reference to Jews working on road construction during the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, it was an allusion to the DG IV project. The large-scale constructions works started in 1942 in preparation for the German advance towards Stalingrad. Organisation Todt was charged with constructing the road and provided technical supervisors while Legion Speer transported supplies. Various German constructions companies were contracted to build different sections of the road. The SS was tasked with providing forced laborers and their guards. Himmler put Higher SS and Police Leader Hans-Adolf Pr√ºtzmann in charge of the SS units involved in the construction. Pr√ºtzmann organized a special task force (Einsatzstab) commanded by Oberstleutnant Walter Gieseke. He commanded four Oberbauabschnittsleitungen (Senior Construction Sector Directorates) based in Vinnytsia, Kirovograd, Kryvyi Rih, and Stalino. In total, about 5,000 Germans worked on the road. A network of small camps for forced laborers was set up about every . About 50 camps for Jews have been documented. These camps were guarded by various auxiliary police battalions of Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Cossack Schutzmannschaft.The main tasks of forced laborers was to produce, collect, and transport materials (e.g. sand, gravel), construct the road, and build protections (e.g. walls against snowdrifts or ditches for drainage). The road was also an anchor for various support facilities ‚Äì field hospitals, veterinary clinics, motor pools, repair shops, supply depots, etc. In July 1943, a directive from Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski transferred the protection of all thoroughfares from the SS to the Wehrmacht. As Red Army began its advance in late summer and fall 1943, sections of the road came under fire and were captured by the Soviets. The last labor camps were liquidated in December 1943. The Operations Staff on DG IV was disbanded in January‚ÄìFebruary 1944. Forced laborers Even though private construction companies contracted to build DG IV paid SS for the forced laborers and their rations, the conditions were very poor and rations were meager. Germans used Soviet POWs to construct the road. The POWs were taken from POW camps and placed into a network of transit camps (Durchgangslager) along the road. The conditions were poor resulting in high rate of deaths. A March 1942 report from one of the camps stated that out of 1,052 POWs taken for works, 183 had already died and 174 had fallen ill. POWs provided insufficient labor force and Germans forced civilians living within on either side of the road to work on DG IV. Conditions of the civilians were better as they were paid for their work and could return home after the workday. However, civilians were also needed to work in agriculture. To protect the labor force, civilians living within the 50 km zone were not to be taken for forced labor to Nazi Germany. The Germans also used Jews to construct DG IV, but there were few located in the vicinity of the road who had survived the mass executions in 1941. Therefore, Germans looked for Jews in the Transnistria Governorate where Jews deported from Bukovina and Bessarabia were housed in various camps. In August‚ÄìNovember 1942 and May 1943, groups of Jews were taken from various camps, including the Pechora concentration camp, in Transnistria to work on DG IV. The food ration were very poor and many Jews died from starvation and exhaustion. Jews unfit for labor were shot. Jewish camps were also liquidated due to impending epidemics or once the assigned section of the road was completed. For example, a camp with about 1,250 Romanian Jews in Lityn was liquidated in September 1942. Despite facing manpower shortages, various German units pursued the Final Solution. According to post-war investigations by the district attorney in L√ºbeck, approximately 50,000 POWs, 50,000 civilian workers, and 10,000 Jews worked on DG IV in 1942. The number of laborers decreased to 70,000 in 1943. This estimate is significantly lower than numbers provided by Hans-Adolf Pr√ºtzmann in a June 1943 letter to Himmler. Pr√ºtzmann stated that more than 140,000 laborers were working on the road and were guarded by about 12,000 men from Schutzmannschaft. In a June 1943 report, Fritz Katzmann stated that about 20,000 Jews \\"passed through\\" the camps built for DG IV and that of road was completed in District of Galicia. German historian estimated that some 25,000 Jews were killed in labor camps related to DG IV in 84 known mass shootings when the labor camps were liquidated in late 1943 and early 1944. Post-war investigations Arnold Daghani, a Jewish artist, managed to escape from one of the camps in near Haysin. In 1960, his diary was translated and published in West Germany. The publication spurred the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes to investigate SS officer Walter Gieseke. He was questioned in 1960 and, after his subordinates provided additional information, in 1968. Both times, Gieseke denied responsibility and shifted the blame to his superior, Hans-Adolf Pr√ºtzmann. No charges were brought against Gieseke due to insufficient evidence. In 2006, a 11-minute film was found in a Baptist church in Cullompton, Devon. It shows high-ranking Nazis off-duty and one man inspecting a camp and receiving a column of slave laborers. Harry Bennett, associate professor at Plymouth University, identified the man as Gieseke which could prove his role in the atrocities along DG IV. In 1966, after a decade-long investigation involving 1,500 interviews, two cases related to atrocities committed at Ternopil were brought before court. Ten men were tried in the first case; two (Paul Raebel and Hermann M√ºller) received life sentences and five others received prison sentences. The second case involved 15 men; received a life sentence while other nine men received prison sentences ranging from 2.5 to 5 years. Other cases were brought in L√ºbeck against Franz Christoffel and Oskar Friese in 1965, in Bremen against Otto Fach in 1970, and in Dortmund in 1971. All these proceedings resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence. Investigation into Walter Mintel, commandant of the Mykhailivka camp, was dropped in 1976. J√ºrgen Stroop, who was inspector of DG IV, was executed in 1952 for his role in the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto.

The film stars Saiyami Kher and Roshan Mathew, with Amruta Subhash and Rajshri Deshpande appearing in supporting roles. Set against the backdrop of 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation, the film tells the story of a bank cashier who discovers a stash of cash hidden in her kitchen sink. It released on Netflix on 5 June 2020. Plot Sarita Pillai and Sushant Pillai are a married couple that live in a lower middle class neighborhood of Mumbai, trying to make ends meet with their young son. While the movie shows the daily struggles of a lower middle class family in Mumbai with all its up and downs, a flashback shows that Sarita and Sushant have a musical background and during a reality singing show, Sarita freezes onstage when the lights reveal a large audience. This past experience chokes her frequently, bringing stress and anxiety. Sarita is now the breadwinner of the family, working as a bank teller while Sushant remains frequently unemployed or engages in small schemes to make money with his neighbors. The burden on Sarita to work long hours at the bank with full responsibility at home causes frequent fights and issues between them. In midst of this, viewers learn that an unknown man brings a heavy suitcase in the same building as the Pillai's who rolls up large cash bundles in a ziploc bag and stuffs it in the bathroom drain. This hidden location is meant to imply hiding of black-money, which is learned to be the cause of choking the water sewage pipe, often causing unusual noises in Pillai's kitchen sink. One night, Sarita wakes up to drink water and she hears loud noises in the same pipe. She goes to check and starts to open and clean up the dirty water. To her surprise, she finds those hidden stuffed bags containing cash. She is astounded and after verifying the validity of the cash at her bank, she uses that cash to pay off Sushant's debt and indulge in buying high- end items for her home. Upon Sushant's inquiry, she responds that she has extra cash from her mother's fixed deposit. Amidst this, episodes of the struggles of her neighbors and continued acrimony between them is shown. In particular, she shares a friendly yet stressful relationship with her neighbor downstairs, whom she adoringly calls Tai (meaning sister in Marathi). With nightly rituals of waking up and un-choking her kitchen pipeline, she continues to benefit from the new source of endless cash and uses it to indulge herself. However, all this free money ends abruptly, when she learns that Prime Minister Modi has introduced demonetization with banning notes of Rs. 500 and 1000. She and her neighbor Tai are distraught as Tai is preparing for her daughter's wedding and Sarita finds her free money ending, putting her back in the same struggle filled life that seemed to resolve with new money. Sarita's life becomes even worse than before with angry customers, long hours and stress at the bank from the demonetization. Meanwhile, Sushant suspects that Sarita is having an extra-martial affair after being shown a video from Sarita's encounter with Reddy, a man from whom Sushant has borrowed money that Sarita had previously paid off from the \\"choked\\" money. Sarita goes to check the kitchen pipe and finds new currency notes of Rs. 2000 denomination, exciting her that despite cash restrictions imposed by the national government, she continues to get this \\"choked money\\" and uses it. Sarita goes to great lengths to hide this secret, even from Sushant by frequently locking up her kitchen and preventing unwanted guests from even sleeping in the kitchen. Unfortunately for Sarita - her cash gathering comes to an abrupt end when thieves hold bank employees at gunpoint and steal all the money, including the cash that Sarita kept with her in her purse. She returns home saddened and dismayed that she loses at the most important moments in her life - during the reality singing show and now with this cash that gave her hope. Despite reassurance from Sushant, she hides the new money information and remains home. Unknown to her, the police are engaging in a criminal investigation into large sums of Rs. 2000 denomination notes haven been given to a local politician who extracted that from a corrupt bank officer in a different city. When questioned by the police, Sarita is dumbfounded, as she feels that her mere use of the \\"choked money\\" will now lead to an unnecessary criminal act against her as police inquire about the large sums of money that she had kept with her. However, Sushant intervenes and tells the police about the ziplock bagged money. During this revelation, the Pillai's neighbor deduce that the large bags being brought in their building were indeed by an assistant of the local politician that were actually newly minted money. They run up and take large sums of cash with them and return to their homes uncaught. After the police encounter the large bags of cash in the house of the assistant, then get Sushant's details. One year later - upon returning from a trip, the Pillai's happily learn that they have been asked to come and collect 10% of the cash that the police encountered during their raid. Upon asking how much money that would be - the movie ends.

There are sporadic moments of stylistic flashiness but mostly the storytelling, like Sarita, is subdued. There is little of the raw, visceral energy we associate with the filmmaker. But as usual, he elicits solid performances from his actors.\\" Rohan Naahar from Hindustan Times gave a mixed response saying, \\"Choked might not be up there with the filmmaker‚Äôs finest, but it‚Äôs his most unusual movie since No Smoking ‚Äî and it most certainly fulfils its duty and performs the Heimlich on a streamer that is gasping for air after a string of back-to-back blunders..\\" Shikhar Verma from High On Films gave a mixed review saying \\"In Choked, the theme and metaphors feel stamped-on rather than organically infused.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2020 films Category:Films directed by Anurag Kashyap Category:Hindi-language Netflix original films Category:Indian direct-to-video films Category:Indian films Category:2020 direct-to-video films Category:Indian drama films Category:Films set in 2016 Category:2020s Hindi-language films Category:2020 drama films ","title":"Choked (film)"},{"id":"64023225","text":"Peter Boas BangBoas legally removed 6 March 1939. was a Danish engineer and entrepreneur. In the year 1925 he founded the company Bang & Olufsen with Svend Olufsen.  Childhood  Peter Boas Bang was son of Camillo Cavour Bang (1861-1949) and Augusta Pouline Boas (1868-1919). His brother Poul Bang was filmdirector and direktor of Saga Studio. Peter Bang grew up in a wealthy house in Kopenhagen, that was well equipped: Electricity, phone and Phonograph. The family owned a car. At the age of nine he went to N√¶rum Kostskole. Because of his mother's frailty he was busy with everything to do with mechanics. He spended his pocket money on batteries, rings and switches. Peter was early interested in technics and radios, and he remembered having heard a record of Enrico Caruso at the age of five. At 14 he left the boarding school and entered the middle school. He was assisted by his cousin Isse Wulff, who was an assistent at Teknologisk Institut. 1917 he finished school, where his practical abilities were pointed out. This led his father Camillo Cavour Bang to let him work in the Siemens & Halske forge, where he did experiments in the night; including a windmill, to supply the sommerhouse of the family.  Studies at Aarhus Elektroteknikum  Peter Bang learned four years und after a short break his father agreed to a study of electrical engineering at the Aarhus High School in Aarhus (Aarhus Electrotechnikum). Here he built several radio sets, for the family in Kopenhagen and the family of the mother, too. During his studies he also experimented with radio technology, and he kept asking his father for money for batteries. So he built in the third year of his study a receiver that did not need any batteries.  Stay in the USA  Peter Bang 1924 When the broadcasting industry, especially in the United States, rapidly developed, Peter Bang went back after his graduation in the US. He and his brother Poul travelled in autumn of 1924 in the US, where Peter studied the production of radios and worked for six months in a radio-factory. Before leaving he talked to his father about the idea of starting a production in Denmark zu beginnen. He could not start immediately, but after his return to Copenhagen he was contacted by his fellow student Svend Andreas Gr√∏n Olufsen, who built a small receiver in Kvuistrup. He needed a sparring partner. Peter went to Svend, and with money Svend's mother earned by selling eggs, the engineers got started. It was the begin of a collaboration for years.

Each founder had a share of 4.000 Nkr, their fathers each 1.000 Nkr. Camillo Cavour Bang was elected for president of the board. After a slow start and small success with a \\"Lichtstromempf√§nger\\" both found out, it was a more profitable market for a product, that supplies batterypowered receivers with energy from the mains. This product, came closest to a generator, was called Eliminator. 1926 it was the first commercial product and was the livelihood of the company for the first years. Then Bang & Olufsen appeared radio installation by Peter Bang as technical innovator. Bang was a man, who tackled and solved ‚Äì often brillantly ‚Äì, without ever realising, how brillant it was. He often got up at night, to perform experiments. As Svend Olufsen died in 1949, Peter Bang ran the company alone until his death 1957.

Opened in 1995, the bar is known for its nightly drag shows. It is a sister establishment to Industry, a nightclub, and Elmo, a restaurant. Barracuda is home to \\"Star Search\\", the longest-running bar show in New York City, which began in the early 1990s and may have served as an inspiration for RuPaul's Drag Race. In the 1990s and 2000s, Barracuda was a popular celebrity hangout, and it was frequently the site of promotional events for new music and Broadway plays. HistoryDrag= alt=Picture of the interior of Barracuda Barracuda opened in Chelsea 1995. Its current owner, Bob Pontarelli, founded the bar with his friend and former partner Stephen Heighton, who died in 2010 or 2011. Heighton was a fan of drag and wanted to showcase that art form at the new establishment. In an interview with The Advocate, several of Barracuda's earliest performers said that it was \\"the first performance- and drag-based bar in Chelsea\\" and one of the first venues in New York to offer one-woman shows to drag queens. It was also among the first to feature a drag show every night. Pontarelli and Heighton had previously co-owned Crobar, a venue in Manhattan's East Village, where a weekly drag show called \\"Star Search\\" began in 1991. They subsequently moved the show to Barracuda, where it still runs. Nashom Wooden, who performed in drag as Mona Foot, hosted \\"Star Search\\" there in the 1990s, and Mimi Imfurst hosted it in 2011. Sherry Vine, Candis Cayne and Hedda Lettuce began their drag careers in the show, which, according to The New York Times, \\"preceded RuPaul's Drag Race by more than 15 years and probably served as one of its inspirations.\\" It is currently the longest- running drag show in New York City. Wooden (as Mona Foot) also hosted the first annual edition of the Glam Awards at Barracuda in 1997. The event, a ceremony √† la the Oscars for the queer nightlife community of New York, is now typically held at larger venues. Jackie Beat, Peppermint and Miz Cracker also started drag at Barracuda. Vine had her own show at the bar until the early 2010s, when she moved her performances to Industry, Pontarelli's nightclub in Hell's Kitchen. Cayne worked at Barracuda for 10 years. Prior to winning season 8 of RuPaul's Drag Race, Bob the Drag Queen was also a fixture at the bar. One of Barracuda's current regular performers is Tina Burner. =Celebrity hangout= Nathan Lane patronized Barracuda weekly. Through the early 2000s, Barracuda was a popular destination for high-profile names and promoters in the entertainment industry. A 2001 New York Times article said, \\"[T]his neighborhood gay bar keeps drawing celebrities, who often appear free, along with record executives, Broadway show promoters and perfume designers in search of the elusive holy grail of cool.\\" Visitors included Eartha Kitt, Mackenzie Phillips, Charo, Tonya Harding and many Broadway stars. Peter Galvin of Atlantic Records stated that music industry executives saw Barracuda as a strategic place to promote new music, and his company \\"organized more than 25 events at the club, like an appearance of Duncan Sheik.\\" Similarly, Broadway promoters took advantage of Barracuda's atmosphere and reputation as a \\"cool and hip place\\" to generate publicity for plays; they frequently arranged for cast members of their shows to appear at the bar. Actor Nathan Lane used to visit Barracuda weekly. While attending a drag show one night, Betty Buckley delivered an impromptu performance of the song \\"Memories\\" from the musical Cats, which was then in its first run on Broadway. Additionally, \\"[t]here was [a] fabled lounge appearance of Australia's Queen of Yodeling, Mary Schneider, who presided over the club until 4 a.m. after singing a powerful version of 'The William Tell Overture.' The former television evangelist Tammy Faye Bakker Messner came calling... to promote a documentary about her life.\\" Pontarelli embraced the spontaneity that such events injected into the atmosphere at Barracuda, and he tried to further cultivate \\"the mood of the unexpected\\" by changing the bar's decor and visual themes up to twice per year. Reception In 2014, Michael Musto ranked Barracuda sixth on his list of \\"the 30 Best Gay Bars in Manhattan\\". Time Out magazine called the bar \\"[a] classic, no-attitude gay lounge in Chelsea [that] has outlasted many others due to its combination of cozy couches, awesome drag shows, generous happy hours and friendly bartenders\\". In a 2019 interview, Miz Cracker said that Barracuda was the first gay bar she ever entered and that it was still her favorite. She further said, \\"[I]n recent years Barracuda has been overshadowed by glitzier hot spots in Hell's Kitchen, including businesses run by the same owner, like Industry Bar. But she's still the only gay bar where I can kick up my feet and genuinely relax for a laugh in the dark with people of all kinds.\\" See also * LGBT culture in New York City * LGBT history in New York  References External links * Category:1995 establishments in New York (state) Category:Chelsea, Manhattan Category:LGBT culture in New York City Category:LGBT drinking establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Barracuda Lounge"},{"id":"64023368","text":"Catherine Vidal (born July 7 1951) is a French neurobiologist, feminist and essayist.

She pursued a research career at the Pasteur Institute, from 1981 to 2014; she was appointed research director there in 1997 and worked in areas including infection of the brain by the AIDS virus, neuronal death in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and prion infections. She authored popular science books on the ethical issues of neuroscience, determinism in biology, neuroplasticity, brain sex and gender. She suggests that rather than just genetics, the differences in the skills and behaviour of men and women are the products of a cultural environment and social construction related to gender which influences brain development because of neuroplasticity. She is a member of the √âmilie duCh√¢telet Institute, UN Women France, the Equality Laboratory, the Women & Science association and is co-director of the √âgale √† √âgal collection. She was co- founder of the NeuroGenderings network (:fr:R√©seau NeuroGenderings) in 2010 and has been a member of the Inserm ethics committee since 2013, where she is co-director of the Gender and Health Research working group. Lauren Bastide wrote a biographic radio broadcast of her on Les Savantes, on France Inter on July 15 2017. Professional criticism In the journal L'Obs in 2014, the biologist Jacques Balthazart criticised the theories of Catherine Vidal, not questioning neuroplasticity but expressing the opinion that biology plays a significant role in the differentiation of male and female behavior as well as in sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2014, researchers Franck Ramus and Nicolas Gauvrit published in the journal Science et pseudo-sciences an article entitled La 'M√©thode Vidal', in which they express the opinion that \\"the synthesis that Catherine Vidal makes of it is extremely biased, incomplete, and that the arguments it uses do not support its conclusions.\\" In 2016, Claudine Junien, Jacques Balthazart, Franck Ramus and six other signatories, in a free forum published by Le Monde, cite several works on the differences between men and women at the cerebral level and contest Vidal's opinions about cerebral plasticity.

Pathalgadi literally translates to 'carving a stone'. On these stones orders would be carved by the tribals, orders such as restricting the entry of outsiders.  About  Tribals from Scheduled Tribes in Jharkhand would sometimes erect engraved stones in times of birth or death. This tradition took on a new shape with the passage of the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA Act). Two civil servants started erecting stones with the PESA Act and Fifth Schedule of the Constitution of India on them, so as to spread awareness among the tribals about their rights. Essentially, the stones were taken to indicate self-rule, demarcate sovereign territory and prohibit entry of outsiders. An example of what is written on one of the slabs: The words on the slab are not a direct representation of the meaning as is conveyed in the Constitution. These slabs were initially erected in four districts of Jharkhand - Khunti, Gumla, Simdega and West Singhbhum.  History  In May 2016, the central government introduced two ordinances which enabled transfer of tribal land to the government as well as for commercial purposes. Following this the Pathalgadi movement regained prominence to fight for the tribal Jal-Jungle-Jameen (water-forest-land) and new stones were erected. The first tribal villages to start the practice were in Khunti district, the birthplace Birsa Munda. The ordinances had to be withdrawn. The tribals behind the movement also boycotted the 2019 Indian general election. In 2018, a list of demands had been sent to various officials, including the President. However by June 2019, many of the tribals, out of fear of arrest or harassment, have moved away from the movement. In blocks such as Khunti, Arki and Murhu, nearly 10% of the population was booked. People‚Äôs Liberation Front of India (PLFI) leaders associated with the movement had been arrested, thousands of tribals were arrested and FIRs filed against at least 14000 people. Some people were booked for sedition. Among the leaders included Father Alfonso Aind, charged in the Kochang gang rape incident, which had been carried out as revenge against women who dared to enter a Pathalgadi village for the purpose of spreading awareness about human trafficking. While the movement has faded away in a number of areas, in some places like Garhwa village in Khunti it continues. However in early 2020, seven people were beheaded in violence related to the movement. An opium cultivation connection as well as a Maoist connection has been described in the India media. Media coverage of the movement, though expansive, is critical, and considers the movement \\"anti-development\\". \\"Samu Oreya, Birsa Oreya and Babita Kacchap involved in Pathalghadi movement in Jharkhand were detained in Gujarat. They were trying to incite people in Vyara and Mahisagar against the government,\\" the Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) said in a statement.\\"They were trying to incite people against the present government in Gujarat's Vyara and Mahisagar.

A group of women active in international affairs voluntary clubs and professional fields created the committee as an counterpart to the National Council of Women. The committee established itself as an independent non-profit organization shortly after it began. Founding and mission Oriented toward anti-communism, the organization convened its first meeting in 1952 to answer the question, \\"what steps should be taken to rally the women of the free world to counteract communist propaganda?\\" Over time, the Committee evolved into a communications network that aimed to bring women's clubs around the world into closer contact. The Committee sought to make an impact on a diverse international network of clubwomen and professionals. Its efforts promoted cooperation across national borders and encouraged the development of women's non- governmental organizations affiliated with the United Nations. An advisory organization rather than a membership group, the Committee consisted of a governing board of roughly a dozen women and a small paid staff, which, at times, included field workers who carried out Committee projects in foreign countries. The Committee sought \\"to provide an international communications link for the exchange of ideas, information and experience among women leaders throughout the world.\\" It did so by cultivating contacts with \\"correspondents,\\" representatives of women's groups from around the globe who subscribed to the organization's newsletter and participated in its conferences and educational initiatives. Ultimately, five thousand women in 140 countries participated in Committee ventures. The committee was named after the associations through which American Revolution leaders shared information and created alliances across geographical divides. Other names that the Committee of Correspondence considered in its first year included Committee on Constructive Action, Blank Committee, and, referring to its work countering Communist propaganda, the Wreckers Committee. Membership and activities The membership of the Committee of Correspondence was largely white and elite. Well-situated women active in voluntary clubs-including Constance Forrest Anderson, a leader in the Young Women's Christian Association of the US, and Rose Parsons, an officer of the International Council of Women-were able to donate considerable time to the organization. Others - notably Eunice Carter and Dorothy Height, both officers of the National Council of Negro Women, as well as Eleanor Coit, like Height, a long- time employee of the Young Women's Christian Association ‚Äî had professional leadership roles in other such groups. The Committee attracted correspondents who were elite volunteers or middle-class professionals. Such women were able to travel internationally and often receptive to the anti-communist tenor of the committee. While the organization was a product of Cold War liberalism, one its more influential lines of work pointed to an emergent model of internationalism based more on empowering the grassroots and facilitating small-scale community development rather than middle-class uplift. In the early 1960s the Committee hired field workers for short-term programs in leadership and skills training for community leaders in foreign countries. Sarale Owens, a former YWCA executive, earned considerable acclaim during her two years spent in East Africa as a Committee field worker. The committee also sent personnel to Latin America. Revelations of C.I.A. funding and dissolution Despite the committee's successes at promoting contacts among women's organizations and hosting conferences both in and out of the United States, it could not recover from revelations published in Ramparts magazine in 1967 that it was among the international organizations covertly funded by the Central Intelligence Agency. Supportive of the committee's commitment to liberal anti-communism, the CIA had funneled funding for the Committee through private foundation grants. The degree to which the CIA had an influence on the committee's programming is disputed. Some members were in contact with CIA agents; others were not aware of such activities. Several Committee efforts were directed at countries of special interest to the CIA. These included a 1961 conference for Latin American journalists that coincided with the Bay of Pigs invasion. Another was a 1963 conference in Iran on the \\"Role of Women in the Community.\\" The event garnered the participation of Ashraf Pahlavi, twin sister to Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the Shah who had taken power after the 1953 CIA-sponsored coup. After the expose in Ramparts, which was further publicized in a series of New York Times articles, President Lyndon Johnson curtailed CIA funding of private foundations. Unable to fill the breach through traditional fundraising methods, the Committee of Correspondence elected to dissolve in 1969.

Early life Thomas Mark Lucas was born in Bristol around 1764. Little is known of his early life or family, except that he received a pocket Bible from his father at a young age and \\"remained a man of deep religious conviction throughout his life\\". By the early 1800s, Lucas was living at Castle Street, Bristol, and was employed as a merchant and teacher of shorthand, an abbreviated symbolic writing method that increases speed and brevity of writing. It was around this time that Lucas became interested in teaching the blind to read and he soon came up with the solution of using simple shorthand characters which could be felt as well as seen. Lucas system Lucas Type, a British tactile alphabet system introduced by Thomas Lucas in 1838 and used to teach blind people, especially children, to read Around 1830‚Äì1832, Lucas developed his so-called Lucas system (or Lucas type), a form of embossed text or tactile alphabet system using a sort of \\"stenographic shorthand\\" with arbitrarily chosen symbols; some strokes had a dot on the end and others did not. The Lucas system signs for different characters appeared simple in outline but in practice could be confusing as similar signs were used in many positions. Consequently, it was not widely used. The Lucas system was one of the first shorthand systems for the blind to be invented and was in use before Braille had been introduced to the UK. Sometime between 1830 and 1832, Lucas set up a small, free school for blind children at Old Market Street, Bristol, where he taught shorthand and English grammar to blind children. In February 1836, 16 prominent Bristolians including Lucas formed The Bristol Society for Embossing and Circulating the Authorised Version of the Bible for the use of the Blind, to provide funds to print a portion of the Bible using the Lucas system. In 1837, Lucas published Instructions for Teaching the Blind to Read with the Britannic or Universal Alphabet, and Embossing their Lessons &c; to assist in the promotion and wider use of his system, which he also referred to as the Britannic or Universal Alphabet. Lucas also delivered public lectures to promote his system wherein his blind pupils would demonstrate their reading ability. Lucas aspired to a single, universal and standardised system of teaching the blind to read \\"by feel\\", but by the 1830s and 1840s multiple systems were in use including his own. In order to publicise his system further, in 1838 Lucas travelled from Bristol to London to demonstrate his system and the successes of his pupils. This led to the foundation of the London Society for Teaching the Blind to Read, later the Royal London Society for Blind People (RLSB). Here, 31 pupils received instruction in reading and writing using the Lucas system. Lucas died on 18 May 1838, shortly after coming to London. Legacy The Lucas system continued to be used after his death and there are two surviving examples of Lucas system books in the Royal National Institute of Blind People collections, The Gospel According to Saint John (1837) and Mother's Last Words (1868). The latter was published after Lucas's death. Between 1838 and the 1860s the Lucas system was developed for foreign languages and music, and secular and religious works in the Lucas system were distributed throughout Britain and the British empire as well as in India and China. All of the nearly twenty surviving publications in the Lucas system held by major UK libraries are religious texts or instructions on how to teach and use the Lucas system. One of the last books published in the Lucas system was Fifty Anecdotes on Various Subjects. In T. M. Lucas's Embossed Stenographic Characters, by Reverend J. W. Gowring and embossed by blind pupils at the London Society for Teaching the Blind to Read, published in 1867. A rare ‚Äì perhaps the only surviving ‚Äì example of embossing apparatus used for the Lucas system is held by the Science Museum, London. In 1871, the Lucas system was still in use in seven institutions for the blind, whereas Braille was only used in four; it was not until 1891 that the Royal London Society for Blind People discontinued the production of materials which used the Lucas system although they had ceased to teach the system in 1861. By the 1890s, the Braille system had became the standard form of \\"reading by feel\\" for the blind. Publications *T.M.

Starvation and its associated illnesses killed about 20 million people in Europe and Asia during World War II, approximately the same as the number of soldiers killed in battle. Most of the deaths from starvation in Europe were in the Soviet Union and Poland, countries invaded by Germany and occupied in whole or part during the war. A central focus of Germany's war policy was overcoming chronic food deficits by conquering Poland and the fertile chernozem, or \\"black earth,\\" region of Ukraine and neighboring republics of the Soviet Union, and expelling, starving, or killing the native populations. German farmers were to be resettled on the vacated lands, thus assuring Germany self-sufficiency in food and enabling Germany to take a secure place alongside the United Kingdom and the United States as a world power. As it worked out, Poland and Ukraine became only minor contributors of food to the civilian population of Germany, as more food came from western European countries such as France and Denmark. To maintain domestic agricultural production while millions of men were serving in the military, Germany imported millions of workers as forced labor. The German state managed to keep its population reasonably well-nourished until at least autumn 1944, but at the cost of killing or starving to death millions of non-Germans. Germany's early successes of conquest and ethnic cleansing came to nothing as it was defeated by the allied powers and after the war suffered some of the hardships that it had inflicted on other countries. Before World War II In the 19th century Germany faced a problem of growing enough food for an increasing population. With competition from imports of inexpensive wheat from North America in the 1870s, Germany adopted a protectionist policy, subsidizing German agriculture by imposing high tariffs on imported food. Agricultural self sufficiency was seen as an important component of national security. In 1891, German Chancellor Leo von Caprivi said \\"In a future war feeding the army and the country will play a decisive role.\\" Despite this emphasis on agricultural self-sufficiency, Germany entered World War I in 1914 as a substantial importer of food and fodder. Blockades and trade embargoes exacerbated shortages. By the end of the war in 1918, Germany's urban population was starving. 763,000 people were estimated to have died from malnutrition and the incidence of many serious diseases increased. The loss of 13 percent of its territory, including agricultural land, as a consequence of being defeated in World War I increased the difficulties of Germany becoming self-sufficient in food. During the years between the two World Wars (1918‚Äì1939), Germany isolated itself from the world market for food, attempting to become self-sufficient. Nazi organization of the agricultural sector of the economy achieved modest successes in the 1930s. When the Nazis took power in 1933, Germany was 80 percent self sufficient in basic crops such as grains, potatoes, meat, and sugar. In 1939, Germany had become 83 percent self-sufficient in basic crops. The Nazi government also took measures to achieve \\"nutritional freedom\\" by discouraging the population's consumption of foods such as white bread, meat, and butter and centering the German diets on brown bread and potatoes. Consuming imports such as coffee and oranges were discouraged. Two nutritional innovations promoted by the Nazis were quark, a milk product formerly used as animal feed, and eintopf, a one-pot casserole of leftovers eaten the first Monday of every month. The nutrition policies resulted in a decline in consumption of 17 percent for meat, 21 percent for milk, and 46 percent for eggs between 1927 and 1937. The dietary austerity encouraged by the Nazis resulted in a \\"continuous and chronic state of undernourishment\\" for some Germans, especially the urban poor. Lebensraum In February 1939, Nazi leader Adolf Hitler told a group of German military officers that food was the most important problem facing Germany. The solution proposed to alleviate Germany's dependence on food imports was to create more Lebensraum (living space) for the German people by conquest and colonization. The Nazis did not create the concept of Lebensraum but adopted it as a central element of their racial and economic objectives. Germany indeed had a shortage of arable land. In 1937, farmers in Germany tilled an average of each compared to for each French farmer, for each British farmer, and a munificent for each American farmer. Moreover, Germany agriculture was backward with too many small or inefficient farms and agricultural workers. Farmers and agricultural workers made up 26 percent of Germany's labor force in 1939. (compared to about 17 percent of the U.S. labor force in the same year which produced a large surplus of food.) The Reichsn√§hrstand (Reich Food Corporation), an all-embracing government entity created in 1933 to promote agriculture, said that Germany needed 7 to 8 million hectares, about , of additional farm land to achieve self-sufficiency in food, insulate Germany from the food shortages that contributed to its defeat in World War I, and enable Germany to match the United Kingdom and the United States in power and influence. To obtain additional farmland, achieve self-sufficiency, and resettle some of its farmers, Germany looked eastward and the conquest of Poland and the Ukraine which was part of the Soviet Union at that time. Ukraine, in particular, was of interest to the Germans because of the extremely fertile \\"black soils\\" (chernozems) of about one half of its land area. Germany and the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Poland in September 1939. Germany began planning an invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1940 and invaded the country in June 1941. World War II German-inspired map with Nazi-specified borders, 1942. Gray-green shade, prewar Germany; inside red lines, area annexed to Germany; white area, German control and German allies; yellow, neutral countries =German policy in Poland= After the conquest of Poland, the former country of Poland was divided into three roughly equal zones. The western part of Poland was annexed by Germany and the eastern part was annexed by the Soviet Union. Between these two zones was the General Government, controlled, but not annexed, by Germany. In the annexed part of Poland, the German objective was to replace the Polish population with ethnic German farmers, deporting most of the Polish population further east to the General Government, but retaining some Poles as serfs on German farms. The annexed area had a population of 8,530,000 people (including about 1 million Polish Jews) and the Germans hoped to replace most of them with 530,000 ethnic Germans who had been repatriated from Eastern Europe in 1939 and 1940. In reality, the plan for massive population transfers and resettlement of Germans on Polish farms fell far short of its goals. Only 180,000 Germans were resettled on formerly Polish farms and by the end of 1940 only 305,000 Poles had been deported to the General Government. Instead millions of Poles were conscripted to work on German farms. The colonization by Germans of Polish farms had little favorable impact toward achieving German self-sufficiency in food production. With the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the General Government area also became an areas for German resettlement and some of its native population of Poles were deported eastward into the Soviet Union. =The Hunger Plan= For Hitler the economic prize sought in the German conquest of eastern Europe were the rich farmlands of Ukraine. The Hunger Plan was developed by Herbert Backe, an agronomist and SS officer, in late 1940 and early 1941 as part of the preparation for the German invasion on the Soviet Union. The Ukraine was the breadbasket of the Soviet Union and Backe envisioned that its grain production, mostly wheat, and oilseeds would be diverted to Germany. The consequence, according to the plan, would be the death by starvation of 20 to 30 million people. The German army invading the Soviet Union would live off the land, \\"forbidden on pain of death to give a Russian even a piece of bread.\\" Once the Soviet Union was defeated, German farmers would take over the land of dispossessed (and likely dead) Ukrainians. Thus a permanent and secure food supply would be ensured for Germany. Although millions of Soviet citizens starved during World War II, the Hunger Plan was never fully implemented and by 1943, ethnic Germans were fleeing eastern Europe ‚Äì not for the purpose of settling on Polish or Ukrainian farms, but rather to escape the advancing Soviet army. The expectations of Germany for obtaining mountains of grain from Ukraine were never met. The Soviet army in retreating from the German army followed a scorched earth strategy. In 1942 and 1943, the two years in which Germany controlled most of Ukraine, the total amount of Ukrainian grain obtained by Germany, including grain for feeding the German army in the Soviet Union, supplemented German domestic production of grain by only 14 percent. =Farm labor= An estimated 13.6 million soldiers, including a few women, served in the Wehrmacht, the German military forces, during World War II‚Äîdrawn from a German population of about 80 million. 4.3 million were killed during the war The heavy military demand for manpower caused severe shortages of labor in Germany for both industry and agriculture. To meet the demand for labor, Germany by 1943 had imported more than 7 million workers from other European countries, many of them forced labor. These additional people had to eat and Germany sat up a system of providing generous rations to the military, an adequate diet for the German population, and a near-starvation diet for the foreign workers. Imports of workers for agricultural work began as early as September 1939 when 100,000 Polish prisoners of war were transported to German farms to dig potatoes. By autumn 1941, 1.1 million Poles and Ukrainians, half of them women, were working on German farms as were 1.2 million prisoners of war, mostly Russians and French. The forced labor of imported workers was responsible for about 20 percent of the food production in Germany during the war. =Requisitioning food= Despite the emphasis on exploiting the agricultural production of Poland and Ukraine and achieving self-sufficiency from domestic production, Germany also imported (or forcibly requisitioned) substantial quantities of food from other countries. In order of the value of their exports from 1939 to 1944, the most important countries exporting food to Germany were (1) southeastern Europe (Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Turkey); (2) Denmark; (3) Italy: (4) France; (5) Netherlands; and (6) Soviet Union (mostly Ukraine). Polish agricultural production from the area annexed by Germany is not included in this total, and most of Polish production in the non-annexed area of the General Government was used to feed the German army. Likewise, the large amounts of food requisitioned in Ukraine and other republics of the Soviet Union to feed the German army are not included in this valuation. There seems a reverse correlation between the repression of the Germans and the amount of food they were able to obtain from other countries. The small country of Denmark, where the German hand was relatively light, exported large quantities of food to Germany (mostly beef, pork, and butter), while much- larger Ukraine, under the heavy hand of the Germans, did not fulfill German expectations that it would be a major source of food for the civilian population of Germany. Author Collingham asserts, \\"The German occupiers would have had a better chance of squeezing more food out of western Europe if they had invested in restructuring agriculture, rather than concentrating on plunder.\\" German confiscation of food in Greece led to the worst famine in western and southern Europe. Half a million Greeks are estimated to have died of starvation during the war. =Rationing and nutrition= Until late 1944 and early 1945 when American and British military advances in the west and Soviet advances in the east cut Germany off from its non-domestic food sources, the German civilian population received an average of 2,500 calories daily with supplements for people engaged in hard labor and pregnant women. Foreign workers received less food as did \\"useless mouths\\" such as prison and concentration camp inmates.

It contains a single species, Koreozospeum nodongense. Etymology The name of Koreozospeum derives from Korea, where this genus was first found. The second part of the name refers to its similarity to the European subterranean carychiid genus Zospeum.Jochum, A., Prozorova, L., Sharyi-ool, M., & P√°ll-Gergely, B. (2015). A new member of troglobitic Carychiidae, Koreozospeum nodongense gen. et sp. n.(Gastropoda, Eupulmonata, Ellobioidea) is described from Korea. ZooKeys, (517), 39. Description Koreozospeum has a thin, squat ovate-conic shell, which shows fine spiral rows of interconnected pits constant throughout the teleoconch. The peristome has an oblique, ear-shaped (auriform) form. The shell shows a conspicuously pleated lip folded back onto the body whorl. Koreozospeum has an interrupted lamellar ridge on the next to last whorl, which then develops a uniformly shaped annular lamella. Distribution and habitat This species is only known from the type locality, Nodong cave in Danyang County in the North Chungcheong Province in South Korea, where the shells were collected in 2000 at an altitude of ca. 271 m. Individuals occur on moist muddy walls in the cave. Conservation The caves in Danyang County are majorly threatened due to large cement factories located in the region. In addition, the caves of Nodong, Gosu and Cheondong are popular tourist attractions. The frequent human traffic is an immediate threat for the species. Currently, Koreozospeum nodongense is known to inhabit only one locality and this area is declining due to human encroachment.

The hairstyle was popular among young Japanese women in the 80s. It is a layered haircut that hides the eyebrows with bangs, and the sides are blown outwards and the back is curled inwards.  History  The feathered hairstyle became internationally popular with Farrah Fawcett, whose hairstyle was referred as the \\"Farrah-do\\", \\"Farrah-flip\\", or simply \\"Farrah hair\\". Some Japanese singers and idols in the late 1970s such as Sakiko Ito had similar hairstyles to the Seiko-chan cut. Seiko Matsuda wore this hairstyle even before her debut; she is seen with the hairstyle in the drama Odaiji ni and on the cover of the first single \\"Hadashi no Kisetsu\\". The hairstyle was established with the release of the second single \\"Aoi Sangoshou\\" and became Matsuda's trademark. It is thought that Matsuda was imitating Olivia Newton-John who at the time had feathered hair. Matsuda kept this hairstyle until the end of 1981. With the release of her single ‚ÄúRed Sweet Pea‚Äù in January of the following year, Matsuda bore shorter hair with a perm, which surprised fans and the public in Japan. According to Matsuda, she wanted to cut her hair, which had a lot of volume since the time of the single ‚ÄúKaze Tachinu‚Äù.  Trend in Japan  When Matsuda debuted in 1980, she became popular among ordinary girls and high school students. From this time on, the names ‚ÄúSeiko cut‚Äù and ‚ÄúSeiko-chan cut‚Äù were established. Popular idols called such as Kyoko Koizumi, Iyo Matsumoto, Chiemi Hori and Yu Hayami debuted with the Seiko-chan cut in 1982. Akina Nakamori, made her debut with a longer Seiko-chan cut, and she later extended it into a ponytail. Later in 1984, idols Momoko Kikuchi and Yukiko Okada, who were juniors of Matsuda, debuted with the Seiko-chan cut. Other idols who debuted with the Seiko-chan cut include Miho Nakayama, Yui Asaka, Hiroko Moriguchi, and Tomomi Nishimura. The trend began to wane in the late 1980s, but pianists such as Toyoyo Nakamichi kept this style until the 1990s. In the 2013 continuous TV novel Amachan, Haruko Amano (Kyoko Koizumi), who played the youth, appeared with a Seiko-chan cut as an aspect of the time.

During his incumbency, he advocated for education for all, a receptive and accountable government, focusing on the best interests of the nation and a strong rule of law. Pohanmal Moeen Marastial migrated to Melbourne, Australia in September 1982. During his early years, Marastial founded a partnership business between Afghanistan and Australia. He also worked as a Legal Interpreter and translator for The department of immigration and border affairshttps://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/ Moeen returned to Afghanistan in the Summer of 2001, following the Borne conference in Germany, where he was appointed as the Deputy Minister of Education. In 2003, Marastial was appointed as a Senior Adviser to the Minister of Interior Affairs and at the mean time , The general director for The Afghanistan Stabilisation Program. Marastial was a Member of the Parliament of Afghanistan from 2003 to 2009. In 2009, he was appointed as a political advisor to Hamid Karzai's Campaign team for presidency. Karzai went on to win the elections in 2009, voted as President. In 2014 Marastial worked in the political and media campaign team of Ashraf Ghani, who is the current president of Afghanistan. Following his election as President in September, Ashraf Ghani wished for Marastial to work with him in the government, but he respectfully declined, saying he preferred to lead his own political party \\"Rights and Justice Party of Afghanistan\\", now known as the Truth and Justice Party or Hezb-e-Haq-wa-Adalat.

The frequency spacing (the address frequency) is unique for every AFBS in the interrogation circuit and does not change when the AFBS is subjected to strain or temperature variation. An addressed fiber Bragg structure can perform triple function in fiber-optic sensor systems: a sensor, a shaper of double-frequency probing radiation, and a multiplexor. The key feature of AFBS is that it enables the definition of its central wavelength without scanning its spectral response, as opposed to conventional fiber Bragg gratings (FBG), which are probed using optoelectronic interrogators. An interrogation circuit of AFBS is significantly simplified in comparison with conventional interrogators and consists of a broadband optical source (such as a superluminescent diode), an optical filter with a predefined linear inclined frequency response, and a photodetector. The AFBS interrogation principle intrinsically allows to include several AFBSs with the same central wavelength and different address frequencies into a single measurement system. Figure 1: A schematic of a refractive index change of a 2œÄ-FBG-type addressed fiber Bragg structure (a), its spectral response (b). ŒªB is the central (Bragg) wavelength, Œ© is the address frequency, S1(Œª) - S3(Œª) denote transfer matrixes describing the uniform sections of the AFBS, SœÜ(Œª) denotes transfer matrix describing the phase-shift section of the AFBS.  History  The concept of addressed fiber Bragg structures was introduced in 2018 by Airat SakhabutdinovSakhabutdinov A.J. Microwave-Photonic Sensor Systems Based on Address Fiber Bragg Structures and their Application for Solving Practical Problems. D.Sc. Thesis. Kazan: Kazan National Research Technical University named after A.N. Tupolev-KAI Publ., 2018. (in Russian) and developed in collaboration with his scientific adviser, Oleg Morozov. The idea emerged from the earlier works of Morozov and his colleagues,Morozov O.G. Symmetrical double-frequency reflectometry for the monitoring of natural and artificial media. D.Sc. Thesis. Kazan, 2004. 333 p. (in Russian)Ilyin, G.I.; Morozov, O.G. Single-frequency coherent radiation in two-frequency conversion method. Patent RU No. A 1338647 SU 4 G02F 1/03. Request 13.04.83; Published 20.04.2004. where the double-frequency optical radiation from an electro-optic modulator was used for the definition of the FBG central wavelength based on the amplitude and phase analysis of the beating signal at the frequency equal to the spacing between the two components of the probing radiation. This eliminates the need for scanning the FBG spectral response while providing high accuracy of measurements and reducing the system cost. AFBS has been developed as a further step towards simplification of FBG interrogation systems by transferring the shaping of double-frequency probing radiation from the source modulator to the sensor itself.  Types of AFBS  Thus far, two types of AFBS with different mechanisms of forming double-frequency radiation have been presented: 2œÄ-FBG and 2Œª-FBG. = 2œÄ-FBG = A 2œÄ-FBG is an FBG with two discrete phase œÄ-shifts. It comprises three sequential uniform FBGs with gaps equal to one grating period between them (see Fig. 1). In the system, several 2œÄ-FBGs must be connected in parallel so that the photodetector receives the light propagated through the structures. = 2Œª-FBG = A 2Œª-FBG consists of two identical ultra-narrow FBGs, the central wavelengths of which are separated by an address frequency. Several 2Œª-FBGs in the system can be connected in series, so that the photodetector receives the light reflected from the structures.  Interrogation principle  Figure 2: An interrogation scheme for two addressed fiber Bragg structures (2œÄ-FBG-type): 1 - a wideband optical source; 2.1 and 2.2 - addressed fiber Bragg structures; 3 - an optical filter with a pre-defined linear inclined frequency response; 4, 7 - photodetectors; 5, 8 - analog-to digital converters; 6, 9 - fiber-optic splitters; 10 - fiber-optic coupler; a - e - optical spectra. Fig. 2 presents the block diagram of the interrogation system for two AFBSs (2œÄ-FBG-type) with different address frequencies Œ©1 and Œ©2. A broadband light source 1 generates continuous light radiation (diagram a), which corresponds to the measurement bandwidth. The light is transmitted through the fiber-optic coupler 9, then enters the two AFBSs 2.1 and 2.2. Both AFBSs transmit two-frequency radiations that are summed into a combined radiation (diagram b) using another coupler 10. At the output of the coupler, a four-frequency radiation (diagram c) is formed, which is sent through a fiber-optic splitter 6. The splitter divides the optical signal into two channels ‚Äì the measuring channel and the reference channel. In the measuring channel, an optical filter 3 with a pre-defined linear inclined frequency response is installed, which modifies the amplitudes of the four-frequency radiation into the asymmetrical radiation (diagram d). After that, the signal is sent to the photodetector 4 and is received by the measuring analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 5. The signal from the ADC is used to define the measurement information from the AFBS. In the reference channel, the signal (diagram e) is sent to the reference photodetector 7 for the optical power output control, and then it is received by the reference ADC 8. Thus, the normalization of output signal intensity is achieved, and all subsequent calculations are performed using the relations of the intensities in the measuring and reference channels. Assume that the response from each spectral components of AFBSs is represented by a single harmonic, then the total optical response from the two AFBSs can be expressed as: :F(t)=\\\\left[{\\\\sum_{i=1}^NA_i\\\\sin(\\\\omega_it)+B_i\\\\sin((\\\\omega_i+\\\\Omega_i)t)}\\\\right]^2, where Ai, Bi are the amplitudes of the frequency components of the i-th AFBS; œâi, is the frequency of the left spectral components of the i-th AFBS; Œ©i is the address frequency of the i-th AFBS. The luminous power received by the photodetector can be described by the following expression: :P(t)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\sum_{k=1}^N\\\\left({A_iA_k\\\\cos((\\\\omega_i-\\\\omega_k)t)+A_iB_k\\\\cos((\\\\omega_i-\\\\omega_k-\\\\Omega_k)t)+ \\\\atop B_iA_k\\\\cos((\\\\omega_i-\\\\omega_k+\\\\Omega_i)t)+B_iB_k\\\\cos((\\\\omega_i-\\\\omega_k+\\\\Omega_i-\\\\Omega_k)t)}\\\\right). By narrowband fitering of the signal P(t) at the address frequencies, a system of equations can be obtained, using which the central frequencies of the AFBSs can be defined: :\\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\sum_{k=1}^N\\\\left({A_iA_k\\\\exp\\\\left ( -\\\\frac{(\\\\Omega_j-\\\\omega_i-\\\\omega_k)^2}{2\\\\sigma^2} \\\\right )+A_iB_k\\\\exp\\\\left ( -\\\\frac{(\\\\Omega_j-\\\\omega_i-\\\\omega_k-\\\\Omega_k)^2}{2\\\\sigma^2} \\\\right )+ \\\\atop B_iA_k\\\\exp\\\\left ( -\\\\frac{(\\\\Omega_j-\\\\omega_i-\\\\omega_k+\\\\Omega_i)^2}{2\\\\sigma^2} \\\\right )+B_iB_k\\\\exp\\\\left ( -\\\\frac{(\\\\Omega_j-\\\\omega_i-\\\\omega_k+\\\\Omega_i-\\\\Omega_k)^2}{2\\\\sigma^2} \\\\right )}\\\\right)=D_j, j=\\\\overline{1,N}, where Dj is the amplitude of the signal at the address frequencies Œ©j, and the exponential multipliers describe the bandpass filters at the address frequencies.

After Roosevelt takes office, the United States conquers Mexico \\"for its own good.\\" = Main plot = In September 1916, the United States has not yet declared itself a participant in World War I. President Roosevelt wants to stay out of World War I. However, the war is going very well for Germany and Roosevelt learns that the Germans have a new weapon whose characteristics are unknown. Luz O'Malley Ar√≥stegui is a senior field operative for the Black Chamber, a U.S. spy and security agency. Luz, who is ethnically Cuban-Irish, impersonates a Mexican-Irish revolutionary in order to contact a German agent who she learns is Baron Horst von D√ºckler. They become lovers and Luz learns that the weapon, called \\"The Breath of Loki,\\" is a poisonous gas that kills on contact. Luz convinces Chiara Whelan, an Irish- American with a grudge against the U.S. to help her. Eventually, Luz has to deal with the German plan to keep the United States out of the war by bringing the poisonous gas to the east coast.

He was a son of Elizabeth Carmichael (1514-1550) and James V of Scotland. His mother later married John Somerville of Cambusnethan.James Somerville, Memorie of the Somervilles, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 385‚Äì9, has 'Katherine' Carmichael. Stewart was given the estates of Coldingham Priory, and was usually called the Prior or Commendator of Coldingham, or \\"Lord John\\". His father, James V, wrote to Cardinal Rodolfo Pio da Carpi, in July 1541 that John should be Prior of Coldingham in place of Adam Blackadder, who became Abbot of Dundrennan, and his son would be able to prevent Protestant doctrine spreading from the nearby border with England.Denys Hay, Letters of James V (Edinburgh, 1954), pp. 358, 426. Stewart was in Paris in February 1551 and wrote to Mary of Guise, who was his step-mother. His letter concerns a property in France, the Abbey of Flavigny en Auxois, a gift to him from Henry II of France.Annie I. Cameron, Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 342-3. In April 1558 he wrote to Mary of Guise from Coldingham about a dispute amongst his tenants in Glasgow who were now threatened with legal action by Robert, Lord Sempill, as Sheriff of Renfrew. Stewart wanted Guise, who was now Regent of Scotland, to intervene in favour of his tenants.Annie I. Cameron, Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 414-5. In January 1560 he sighted the English fleet commanded by William Wynter off Dunbar sailing towards the Isle of May and sent a boat to investigate.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 273, 295. John Stewart's wedding was celebrated at Crichton Castle Mary, Queen of Scots made him keeper of Dunbar Castle when she returned to Scotland in August 1561. The English diplomat Thomas Randolph wrote that Lord John was in the queen's favour in October 1561, for his \\"leaping and dancing\\", and would marry the Earl of Bothwell's sister, Jean Hepburn.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 563. Lord John, his half-brother Lord Robert, the Marquis of Elbeuf and others performed in a tournament in December 1561 on the sands of Leith. There was \\"running at the ring\\", with two teams of six men, one team dressed as women, the other as exotic foreigners in strange masque garments. Mary, Randolph, the French ambassador Paul de Foix, and a Monsieur de Moret, envoy from the Duke of Savoy attended this entertainment. There had been a similar tournament at Amboise involving Mary's uncle Francis, the Grand Prior, dressed as a gypsy with a baby, and the Duke of Nemours as a townsman's wife with a bunch of keys, and in 1594 another event involving cross-dressing was staged at the baptism of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 576, 579: Joseph Robertson, Inventaires de la Royne Descosse (Edinburgh, 1863), p. lxxvii citing Brant√¥me: Michael Bath, Emblems in Scotland: Motifs and Meanings (Brill, 2018), pp. 93-6. Lord Robert married Jean Kennedy, sister of the Earl of Cassilis on 13 December 1561. Soon after this Lord John was involved in a disturbance in Edinburgh that started as a kind of masque in the town.Sarah Carpenter, 'Masking and politics: the Alison Craik incident, Edinburgh 1561', Renaissance Studies, 21:5 (November, 2007), pp. 625-636. He and the Earl of Bothwell and the Marquis of Elbeuf went to the house of Cuthbert Ramsay where Alison Craik, a merchant's daughter and mistress of the Earl of Arran was lodged. When they were not admitted they broke down the doors. There were complaints to the queen and she issued a reprimand. Bothwell and Lord John ignored this and the next day there was a face-off between their followers and the Hamiltons in the market place.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 582-3. Lord John's efforts to capture the Earl of Huntly ended in failure. Mary sent him to arrest the Earl of Huntly at Huntly Castle in October 1562. On the day William Kirkcaldy of Grange and the Tutor of Pitcur arrived first and surrounded the house. While Kirkcaldy was talking to the porter, the castle watchman on the tower spotted Coldingham and the Master of Lindsay and their troops a mile off. He alerted the Earl, who hopped over a low wall at the back of the castle and found a horse before Pitcur could stop him. Elizabeth Keith, Countess of Huntly then welcomed the queen's men in and gave them a meal and showed them around the place.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 657-8. He entertained Mary at Dunbar Castle on 30 December 1562.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 674. He died at Inverness in November 1563. John Knox told a story about his last words. Someone told Mary, Queen of Scots that Stewart's deathbed wish was that she would become a Protestant. Mary declared without hesitation that this version of Coldingham's speech was a lie invented by the treasurer John Wishart of Pitarrow and her brother Moray's secretary John Wood.David Laing, Works of John Knox, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1848), pp. 392‚Äì3. Marriage and children He married Jean Hepburn, daughter of Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell. The wedding was celebrated at Crichton Castle on 3 January 1562.

Life Ellis was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1892. Her mother was Mary Sharpe Taylor and her father would be made the first Lord Mayor of Newcastle in 1907 and he would in time be Sir Joseph Baxter Ellis. She was the first of their four children. Ellis signed up to join the volunteer FANYs in 1915. Ellis was awarded a medal in 1918 by the Queen of Belgium for her service during World War I. The FANYs in Belgium were reluctant to leave their life together and return home in 1919. Their commander Grace McDougall's decision was made for her because her mother was dangerously ill so she had to return. It fell to Ellis to demobilize the FANY's and send them \\"back to blighty\\". The decision was made after seeing soldier/mechanics returning from the war and unable to get work. It was felt that men should have the jobs. The FANY would have been completely disbanded, but the organisation escaped this because they were all volunteers. However the organisation became peripheral and it was due to leadership of Ellis and others that the FANY continued. She was leading the Northumberland section in 1928 and she rose to lead the corps in 1932 taking over from \\"The Boss\\" Lilian Franklin OBE. Helen Gwynne-Vaughan was first made Chief Controller of the newly formed Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) in 1939. This was a role that Ellis had turned down as she preferred to lead the volunteer First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANYs). Ellis agreed however to supply 1500 women to serve with the ATS as long as they could be independent. This was agreed but Gwynne-Vaughan broke the agreement and forced the attached FANY staff to be absorbed. Gwynne-Vaughan held the role to 1941. Ellis would become a deputy-director at the ATS throughout the war. Whilst Marian Gamwell took over the leadership of the remaining FANYs and her sister took a special interest in the FANYs who ran the Special Operations Executive. Ellis retired in 1947 and was succeeded by Maud MacLellan. Ellis went to live with her loyal friend the artist Marjorie (Tony) Kingston Walker where they painted and cared for dogs at Bellingham and West Woodburn and died in a hospital in Corbridge in 1968.

Page (1894-1983) was an American dentist and alternative health advocate known for his pseudoscientific views on dental health, dieting and disease. Biography Page was born at Picture Rocks, Pennsylvania and established a dentistry practice in Muskegon, Michigan, in 1919.Tucker, S. D. (2018). Quacks!: Dodgy Doctors and Foolish Fads Throughout History. Amberley Publishing. pp. 58-67. Page was influenced by the pseudo-nutritional ideas of Weston Price. He joined the staff of a nearby hospital where he conducted blood chemistry tests and developed pseudoscientific ideas on dental health. Page argued that for bones and teeth to stay healthy there has to be a calcium-to-phosphorus ratio of 10:4 present in the blood and if this ratio was maintained then absorption of dentures would not occur. Milk and sugar consumption are not recommended as they destroy the correct calcium-phosphorus balance and rot the teeth. Page's ideas were not well received in the dentistry profession and he was deemed a quack. He moved to Florida and whilst waiting for a new dentistry licence took up a career as a fisherman. Page obtained a new licence and set up a clinic in St. Petersburg in 1940. The clinic conducted unusual practices for example, his dental patients stayed at the clinic for two weeks and were fed seaweed supplements and had their body chemistry examined. Page coined the term \\"balancing body chemistry\\" which was described by medical experts as a quack concept without scientific basis.Sutton, Amy L. (2008). Dental Care and Oral Health Sourcebook. Omnigraphics. p. 647. He considered tooth decay to be an \\"outstanding example of systemic chemical imbalances.\\" He promoted the \\"Page Food Plan\\" which encouraged people to eat green vegetables and trace minerals to balance their body chemistry. He also utilized micro doses of endocrine extracts to balance the body chemistry of his patients. One of Page's irrational methods was to measure the length of his patients arms or legs. These anthropological measurements allegedly reflected the \\"genetic disposition\\" of how much juice their bodies needed. Page clashed with the Federal Trade Commission (FDA) as he marketed a mineral supplement known as \\"Ce-kelp\\" with false health claims.Gardner, Martin. (1957). Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science. Dover Publications. pp. 222-223 In 1940, he was stopped by the FDA for selling Ce-kelp as he advertised the product as curing everything from cataracts to cancer.Trimmer, Eric J. (1965). Live Long and Stay Young: An Essay on Positive Health and Rejuvenation. Allen & Unwin. p. 27 The FDA charged Page with \\"unfair and deceptive\\" acts based on his false claims that Ce-kelp would supply minerals missing from modern diets due to rainfall having washed them from the soil and restoring impoverished glands by supplying necessary salts. Opposition to milk In his book Degeneration-Regeneration, Page argued that cow's milk is an \\"unnatural\\" poison and people should not drink it or give it to their children.Whelan, Elizabeth M; Stare, Frederick J. (1992). Panic in the Pantry: Facts & Fallacies About the Food You Buy. Prometheus Books. p. 19. He stated that milk consumption is the underlying cause of many diseases including colds, sinus infections, colitis and cancer. Price believed that milk was corrupting modern society and had destroyed ancient civilizations. Page predicted that \\"cancer will soon be discovered to be due to constitutional tendency, to consumption of sugar, and to consumption of milk.\\" Instead, he advised people to eat seaweed supplements which he sold under the brand Ce-kelp. Page claimed that more people die of cancer per capita in Wisconsin than any other state and this is evidence that milk is a dangerous food as Wisconsin is a dairy state, known for its milk production. Science writer Martin Gardner described this as one of the \\"most elementary of statistical fallacies\\" and noted that \\"people in Wisconsin tend to be long- lived and since cancer is a disease of middle and elderly years, it is a more frequent cause of death in Wisconsin than in many other states.\\" Page managed the Biochemical Research Foundation.

The film was directed by Milan Chams, written by Pradeep Bhardwaj, produced by Milan Chams, and executive produced by Arpan Sapkota under the banner of Chams Entertainment. The film stars Paul Shah, Barsha Siwakoti, Najir Hussain, Buddhi Tamang, and Desh Bhakta Khanal. Bir Bikram 2 is a sequel to the 2016 film Bir Bikram, and received mixed reviews from the critics. Comedian Pranesh Gautam was arrested and detained for nine days following a complaint filed by Chams about Gautam's negative review.  Plot  Two best friends, Bir (Paul Shah) and Bikram (Najir Hussain), fall in love with the same girl, Badal (Barsha Siwakoti). She falls in love with Bir. Then Baag Bahadur (Buddhi Tamang) also falls for Badal. He breaks the two best friends apart and kidnaps Badal. Bir and Bikram swear to get Badal back, and eventually do. In the end, she forgives Baag Bahadur for kidnapping her.  Cast  * Paul Shah as Bir * Barsha Siwakoti as Badal * Najir Hussain as Bikram * Buddhi Tamang as Baag Bahadur * Desh Bhakta Khanal  Reception  Abhimanyu Dixit of The Kathmandu Post said the film was sexist, writing, \\"Even in Bir Bikram 2, both the male leads take sneaky pictures of Barsha Siwakoti's character without her knowledge. Is this acceptable behaviour? In one scene, a character blatantly says \\"Budi ko fariya ho ra chyatna lai?\\" (Am I your wife's skirt to tear?). How's that not sexist?\\" Rupak Risal of Moviemanu wrote, \\"The entire climax could have been shortened to sharpen the final act. Controlled performances from all, however, Buddhi Tamang is overly dramatic at the beginning. His performance is much more convincing in the second half\\". Pranesh Gautam, a comedian, produced a review of the film, calling it \\"unnecessarily loud\\" and noting that \\"the story is strikingly similar to the Bollywood hit Sholay (1975), and the film has nothing new to offer\\". He was arrested and detained for nine days after a first information report was filed by the director, Milan Chams, who accused Gautam of \\"defamation, libel, expressing sexist, racial remarks through social media while reviewing the movie\\" and of cyber crime. Gautam was arrested under the Cyber Crime Act. This caused an outcry among Nepali youths. Gautam was released after nine days in jail.

He began his career while Angola was still under the rule of the Portuguese Empire and his music often expressed left-wing and anti-colonialist sentiments. After Angola obtained independence from Portugal in 1975, he was given the official position of Director of Music in the incoming MPLA regime. His career only lasted for about a decade, but he established himself as one of the biggest name in the \\"golden age\\" of Angolan music of the early 1970s. He was killed during or after a failed coup that took place in 1977 and his music was banned from radio for more than a decade.  Early and personal life  He was born David Gabriel Jos√© Ferreira on August 23, 1944, in Quifangondo, Luanda Province. He was the son of Gabriel Jos√© Ferreira and Carolina Jos√© Afonso, both choristers of the Methodist Church. He attended primary and secondary education in the province of Cuanza Norte. For a while he worked at a foundry in Hoji Ya Henda. In November 1976 he married Maria Trindade, while on military duty in S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. He had four children, Miguel Gabriel Ferreira, Maria Carolina David Ferreira, Deolinda David Gabriel Ferreira and David Gabriel Jos√© Ferreira.  Career  In 1966, David Z√© met the singer Urbano de Castro, who convinced him to pursue a musical career. His first record, released that same year, was \\"Kadica Z√©\\". Along with de Castro and Artur Nunes he formed a trio of the most popular singers of the early 1970s, a period which is described by music historians as the \\"golden era\\" of Angolan music. Their music was central to the new cultural and nationalistic sense of identity which developed in Angola at the time, making them targets of the Portuguese authorities. They were known for politically charged music which drew inspiration from several genres including semba and rebita, as well as blending in Latin and psychedelic influences. His 1975 abum \\"Mutudi Ua Ufolo/Vi√∫va Da Liberdade\\", released in the year of Angola's independence, is considered his most celebrated work and among the most iconic albums from that era. = Independence = After Angola obtained independence, David Z√© enjoyed great appreciation from the newly installed president Agostinho Neto, who commissioned him to attend the independence celebrations of Mozambique, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and Guinea-Bissau, where he performed the song \\"Quem matou Am√≠lcar Cabral\\". He was coordinator of the musical group Alian√ßa Fapla-Povo, who accompanied Neto on all his tours, whether home or abroad, and was meant as a sort of itinerant embassy of Angolan culture.  Death  On 27 May 1977, Nito Alves, a hardline member of the MPLA and leader of the Fractionist group, launched a failed coup against Agostinho Neto, which lead to a wave of reprisals that left thousand dead. Z√©, alongside fellow musicians de Castro and Nunes were among those killed, but no official account of their death exists. David Z√© was seen as supporter of Neto, which he made abundantly clear in his lyrics, so the reasons for which he was singled out by the regime remain unclear. According to some sources, he was a member of the coup or at the very least, sympathetic towards it, while historian Marissa J. Moorman maintains that the popularity of MPLA's musicians began to eclipse that of its leaders, who were beginning to be seen increasingly as out of touch, and that worried the authorities enough to eliminate them.  Legacy  After his death, David Z√©'s music was unofficially banned from radio and remained banned for more than a decade after his death. The clampdown on free speech and cultural activities that followed the coup, as well as the demise of the Companhia De Discos De Angola record label, which released much of Z√©'s music, further contributed to the erasure of his legacy. After the end of the Angolan Civil War, a renewed interest in Z√©'s music developed. In 2001, an annual festival called \\"Super Caldo do Poeira\\" was established to celebrate the music of David Z√© and other early pioneers of semba music. In 2004, a double CD edited by R√°dio Nacional de Angola and titled Memorias de David Z√© was released, collecting a substantial part of the singer's work. The song \\"Friends\\" by Nas and Damian Marley samples \\"Undenge Uami\\", which appears on Mutudi Ua Ufolo.

The roller coaster is being manufactured by Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC) and is set to open in 2021. It is themed to the Jersey Devil, a mythical creature rumored to live in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. The coaster is one of RMC's single-rail raptor models.  History  On August 29, 2019, Six Flags Great Adventure announced that the Jersey Devil Coaster would be built and opened for the park's 2020 season. It would be replacing the old Looney Tunes Seaport area of the park. Jersey Devil Coaster is considered one of the top 10 new roller coasters anticipated for the 2020 season according to USA Today. Due to the growing concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic, Six Flags announced a suspension of operations across the company on March 13, 2020. This included all operations at Six Flags Great Adventure, including the construction for the new coaster. The park resumed operations on July 3, 2020, with the Jersey Devil Coaster still fenced in for construction. Earlier in April 2020, Six Flags announced measures for the company to survive the pandemic, including deferring capital projects across the company that was slated for the 2020 season. In June 2020, the park announced that the opening of the Jersey Devil Coaster had been delayed to the 2021 season. Ride experience The Jersey Devil Coaster will use four trains, each containing 12 rows, with one passenger per row. It will be a single-rail roller coaster with two inversions. According to renderings, after going up the tall lift hill, the train will go down a 87¬∞ drop, which leads into a dive loop and then an 180¬∞ stall. It will then go up into a turnaround, which drops down into a zero-G roll. After a mid-course brake run, the train will go over a few airtime hills, before fully braking at the end, and turning around to go back into the station.

In March 2016, El- Waylly and her husband opened a diner called Hail Mary in Brooklyn, which attracted favorable reviews. However, it closed after 11 months, which El- Waylly attributes in part to opening Hail Mary without other investors, and in part to the expectations of white customers. In a 2017 interview with GQ, El- Waylly explained that customers often entered Hail Mary expecting \\"foreign or exotic ingredients\\" because of the owners' cultural backgrounds; she stated \\"There would have been more leeway allowed in the food shrouded by illusion of ‚Äòauthenticity‚Äô...There are white chefs that can pull from different cultures without explanation, but us making white food always needs a thesis behind it.\\" El-Waylly worked at Serious Eats as a culinary editor through most of 2018 and joined Bon App√©tit magazine in August 2019.

Early life He was the first son of Hugh Lewis of Presaddfed and his mother was Agnes, daughter of Sir William Gruffydd of Penrhyn. Between the deaths of his father and grandfather he was the ward of John Puleston. CareerOffices held= He was Sheriff of Anglesey in 1548‚Äì9, 1557-8 and 1571‚Äì2. He was commissioner of relief in 1550. He was commissioner of goods of churches and fraternities in 1553. =Official records= He makes few appearances in official records until the reign of Edward VI, though later records show he leases of lands to him in Anglesey started before the end of the reign of Henry VII. He was a plaintiff in the Star Chamber against Richard and Thomas Bulkeley concerning the making of a mill dam. The dispute was part of a developing row between Lewis and Sir Richard Bulkeley. Lewis and Bulkeley were cousins. =MP= Lewis was elected to the first parliament of Mary I, which was disputed by Sir Richard Bulkeley. Bulkeley claimed the sheriff had falsely returned Lewis despite Bulkeley getting the majority of votes. In the actions by the attorney-general of the Exchequer and Bulkeley himself the judgements went against the sheriff and thus against Lewis. By the time the common pleas reached their conclusion in Trinity term 1555 Bulkeley had twice been elected for Angelsey after Lewis. It isn't known if Bulkeley ran for parliament in autumn 1555, but Lewis was returned as MP. The feud between Lewis and Bulkeley continued and it was deplored by William Llyn in a poem of 1560 as poisoning the social life of the island. Lewis was not among the members of the first Marian parliament to oppose the restoration of Catholicism. Neither was he one of the fourth Marian parliaments known to have voted against government bills. Twenty years later he was listed as a Catholic by an agent of Mary, Queen of Scots. He was however able to serve the Elizabethan regime. Personal life He married Margaret, daughter of John Puleston MP. They had three sons and seven daughters. His second marriage was to Ellen, daughter of Edward ap Hugh Gwyn of Bodewryd. They had one son and one daughter.

The only fossils that have been recovered are from the Willwood and Fort Union Formations in the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming, United States, and date to the Clarkforkian to Wasatchian, about 56 to 50 million years ago. Fifty-six collections that have been recovered thus far include the remains of Azygonyx. Azygonyx survived the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum along with other mammals like Phenacodus and Ectocion, both of which were ground-dwelling mammals. Azygonyx probably was a generalist terrestrial mammal that may have roamed around the ground, but was also capable of climbing trees.  Etymology  The genus name comes from the \\"a-\\" meaning absent, \\"zygos-\\" meaning joining, and \\"onyx\\" meaning claw referencing the unjoined claw-like incisors.  Taxonomy  Azygonyx is placed in the suborder Tillodontia, an extinct group of mammals characterized by rodent-like incisors, clawed feet, and an elongated rostrum and mandibular symphysis. Azygonyx belongs to the family Esthonychidae, but differs from other esthonyids by having an unfused mandibuar symphysis. Five species of Azygonyx are currently known and includes the type species Azygonyx gunnelli (Gingerich and Gunnell, 1979) and the additional species Azygonyx ancylion (Gingerich and Gunnell, 1979), Azygonyx grangeri (Simpson, 1937), Azygonyx latidens (Simpson, 1937), and Azygonyx xenicus (Gingerich and Gunnell, 1979). The genus has a relatively problematic taxonomic history, as the type species Azygonyx gunelli and other species of the genus are alternatively named Esthonyx by Lucas and Schoch (1998). The type species comes from Park County in northwestern Wyoming, and is composed of teeth, cranial, and postcranial bones. The bone fragments were broken and scattered suggesting a taphonomic pathway that includes trampling before burial. The holotype specimen (UM 83874) from Wyoming, USA consists of upper and lower dentition with dentary bone. Post cranial remains include the scapula, ulna, radius, ankle bones, and others.  Description  No complete skeleton of Azygonyx has been recovered, making the exact appearance and body size of the animal relatively difficult to determine. Compared to other tillodonts, Azygonyx was relatively small, as indicated by an ulna length of about and a mandible about . The upper dentition of Azygonyx includes three inciscors (I1‚ÄìI3), one canine (C1), premolars (P2‚ÄìP4), and molars (M1‚ÄìM3), and the lower dentition includes two incisors (I1‚ÄìI2), one canine (C1), premolars (P2‚ÄìP4), and molars (M1‚ÄìM3). An lower first incisor has not actually been recovered, but is believed to be present due to the available space in the lower jaw. A lower third incisor was likely extremely reduced or absent. The incisors of Azygonyx are tall and nearly vertical. The anterior teeth, the incisors and canines, were crowded. The second incisor has a massive oval crown. Lower premolars have smooth enamel set in a relatively deep jaw and the third premolar crown is large and bulbous.  Paleoecology  Tillodonts are considered to be generalists and some may have been rhizophagous. The large and laterally compressed claws and shallow trochlea of the astragalus suggests that the mode of life of Azygonyx was scansorial, or adapted for climbing. In contrast, bones of the foot suggest a somewhat cursorial or fossorial lifestyle. Worn enamel on the teeth additionally suggest Azygonyx stripped vegetation. Azygonyx likely spent a lot of time in trees, but also occasionally searched for food on the ground or dug for roots.  References  Further reading  * W. C. Clyde. 1997.

The shootout became controversial due to the death of two civilians including a 7-year-old girl in the cross-fire. Director Leopoldo Bataoil, chief of the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO), described the shootout as the bloodiest firefight between lawmen and criminal elements in Metro Manila. Background In the 2000s, many cities in Luzon were beset by crimes conducted by various robbery groups, many of whom were of Waray ethnicity.Reynaldo, Richard. Kapobrehan Ha Aton Nayon. Visayas State University SP. June 5, 2005 Poverty during President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's administration caused many in faraway provinces to form or join a gang. Hold-ups were the primary activity, where they would rob cars, buses and trucks in rural roads, as well as banks and stores in urban areas. August 27, 2015 At that time, they became notorious for their shootouts with the law enforcement and open anti-authoritarian stance, with one gang member proclaiming once how he hated the police during a robbery in Pampanga.

The latter were driving in SUVs and motorcycles when they sensed that they were being followed. After spotting the officers, the gang started to open fire. Law enforcement consisted of the Highway Patrol Group, Special Action Force, National Capital Region Police Office and Southern Police District fired back. Both parties were well-armed, with the gang sporting M16s fitted with underbarrel grenade launchers. In the gunfight that ensued, the SAF unit managed to kill eight suspects inside a vehicle, while the HOG killed two more armed men on motorcycles. During their escape, the gangsters tried to blow up a diesel tanker to divert the cops' attention. An OFW seaman by the name of Jun De Vera and his daughter Lia, were caught in the crossfire and killed. By the end of the hour-long battle, sixteen people died including ten criminals but many had managed to escape. December 08, 2008 Barangay tanod Bernard Tuncab died as he was rushed to the hospital.

He was a lecturer for the workers' education movement, co- founder of the Communist Party of Germany, professor at the University of Rostock, and rector of East Germany's trade union academy.  Biography  Duncker was born in Hamburg as a merchant's son. He studied music at the Leipzig Conservatory, then history, economics and philosophy at the University of Leipzig. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1893. In 1898 he married K√§te Duncker (n√©e Doell) who was then a teacher, but also became a socialist politician, journalist and feminist. The couple had three children: daughter Hedwig (1899‚Äì1996, physician), and sons Karl (1903‚Äì1940, Gestalt psychologist) and Wolfgang (1909‚Äì1942, journalist and film critic). In 1900, Duncker started teaching at the Leipzig workers' educational association. In 1903 he completed his Ph.D. under supervision of Karl B√ºcher and Karl Lamprecht. In the same year, Duncker became a journalist at the SPD- affiliated Leipziger Volkszeitung. In 1904, he founded a \\"workers' secretariat\\" (information and advice centre for the labour movement) in Leipzig, and in the following year in Dresden. In 1907, the family moved to Stuttgart from where Hermann Duncker toured the country as an itinerant teacher for workers' education. During the First World War, Hermann and K√§te Duncker were protagonists of the SPD's leftist, internationalist and pacifist wing. Together with Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg and Clara Zetkin they were among the founders of the Spartacus League that became the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) during the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919. Both K√§te and Hermann Duncker were elected to the KPD's first central committee. He resumed his lecture tours and directed KPD schools on the regional and national level. In 1925 he co-founded the Berlin Marxist Workers' School. In the KPD central committee he was responsible for education and instruction. He represented the relatively moderate \\"Middle Group\\" within the party that aimed for a united front with the Social Democrats. Therefore, he was sidelined from the radicalising party leadership after 1929. After the Nazis' seizure of power, Duncker, like most communist leaders, was taken into \\"protective custody\\" in February 1933, but he was released in November of the same year. In 1936 he emigrated to Denmark, then to England and France. Duncker was distraught over the persecution of his son Wolfgang and his comrade and friend Nikolai Bukharin during Stalin's Great Purge in the Soviet Union (Wolfgang died at Vorkutlag in 1942, but his parents were uncertain about his fate until 1948). Duncker also fell out with the KPD's Moscow leadership over the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, which he strongly opposed. K√§te Duncker had fled to the United States, living with their son Karl who suffered from depression and committed suicide in 1940. When the German Wehrmacht invaded France in the Summer of 1940, Duncker fled from Paris to Vichy France's so-called zone libre. His wife organised a visa for Duncker's entry to the United States in late-1940. During a stopover in Casablanca (French Morocco), he was temporarily detained, and only arrived in New York in September 1941. In the US, Duncker joined the Council for a Democratic Germany in 1944. Grave of Hermann Duncker at the Memorial to the Socialists, Friedrichsfelde central cemetery After the end of the war, K√§te and Hermann Duncker returned to Germany (Soviet occupation zone) in May 1947. He joined the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED; created in April 1946 by the forced merger of KPD and SPD). In the same year he was appointed professor at the University of Rostock, teaching history of social movements, and dean of the faculty of social sciences. In the German Democratic Republic (GDR; East Germany), Duncker became the rector of the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB) academy in Bernau bei Berlin in 1949. Almost blind by that time, he held that position until his death. From 1955 to 1960 he was also a member of the East German trade union federation's executive board. Duncker was awarded the Order of Karl Marx (highest decoration of the GDR) in 1953, an honorary doctorate of the University of Leipzig in 1954 and the highest class of the Patriotic Order of Merit in 1955. He was buried near the Memorial to the Socialists at the Berlin Friedrichsfelde central cemetery.

His father was James Hackett FitzPiers, from an Old English family at Ballytarsna near Cashel, County Tipperary. From his Gaelic Irish mother Mair√©ad N√≠ Chearna (Margaret Kearney) of Littleton he seems to have gained knowledge of Gaelic legends and folklore. He joined the Dominicans in Limerick about 1625 and went to the Irish College, Louvain in 1628, returning to Ireland in 1638 as prior of St. Dominic's Abbey, Cashel. The Butlers of Dunboyne were related to his mother and patrons of his; the 1640 death of Edmond [Eamonn] Butler, Baron Dunboyne was a turning point in his personal and poetic life. He wrote a (lament) for Eamonn whose metre became usual in of the subsequent decades.Deane et al 2002 p.411; √ì Tuama 1998 p.4 He supported the 1641 Rebellion and in the ensuing Catholic Confederation he was a preacher in the Munster army.

While the number of genera and species is less agreed upon, it has been determined that two apatemyid genera, Apatemys and Sinclairella, existed sequentially during the Eocene in North America. The genus Apatemys, living as far back as 50.3 million years ago (mya), existed through part of the Wasatchian and persisted through the Duchesnean, and Sinclairella followed, existing from the Duchesnean through the Arikareean. Examinations of specimens belonging to the genus Apatemys suggest adaptations characteristic of arboreal mammals. Etymology The genus name Apatemys likely derives from the Greek apate meaning ‚Äúdeceit‚Äù and mys meaning ‚Äúmouse‚Äù. In Greek mythology, Apate represented deceit and was one of the evil spirits released from Pandora's box. While the Greek word ‚Äúmys‚Äù is used in reference to the mouse- like size of apatemyids, the relationship between the Greek word ‚Äúapate‚Äù and the genus Apatemys is unknown.  Taxonomy The family Apatemyidae has no sister taxa and has faced much disagreement regarding its origins and affinities. Apatemyids are scarce even in the faunas where they are most often discovered, and constructing valid taxonomy is challenging since the specimens are typically retrieved in small sample sizes. Early hypotheses for apatemyid affinities include relations to ungulates and rodents, but the most popular early suggestions were classifying them with Insectivora or assigning them to their own order of Apatotheria. It was later proposed that apatemyids belong to the order Cimolesta, which deemed apatemyids more closely related to carnivores than to rodents. However, the relationships of the Apatemyidae continue to be speculated, with connections to other groups like primates being proposed. More valid taxonomic information is known about the genus Apatemys and the species belonging to the genus. Apatemys has 14 sister taxa also belonging to the family Apatemyidae, including Apatemyinae, Carcinella, Eochiromys, Frugivastodon, Heterohyus, Jepsenella, Labidolemur, Russellmyinae, Russellmys, Sinclairella, Stehlinella, Teilhardella, Unuchinia, and Unuchiniinae. There are 13 species belonging to the genus Apatemys. The type species for the genus is Apatemys bellus. Apatemys bellus was named by Marsh (1872), and its type specimen (YPM 13512) consists of a mandible. The species of the genus Apatemys belong to the suborder Apatotheria, whose sister taxa are Didelphodonta, Cimolestidae, Palaeoryctida, Pantodonta, Pantolesta, Pentacodontidae, Sarcodontidae and Todralestidae. Description Apatemyids are highly specialized eutherian mammals prevalent throughout Tertiary deposits of North America, Europe, and India. Most apatemyids were similar in size to the extant Dactylopsila trivirgata, otherwise known as the New Guinea striped possum. A skeleton of Apatemys chardini that was found in southwestern Wyoming was measured to be 36 cm, with its tail being nearly two thirds of its total length. With a body-and-head length of 15 cm, the size of Apatemys chardini is indeed comparable to that of the New Guinea striped possum, which has an average body length of 12 cm. The skeleton of apatemyids was rather slim, and their skull was large in comparison. Other information on skull morphology has been limited due to the skulls of the few complete skeletons of the Apatemyidae being crushed. Significant postcranial adaptations include the elongated second and third digits and elongated and gracile tail. Apatemyids are also characterized by various dental features including a large and procumbent first lower incisor, a vertically oriented first upper incisor, an elongated and blade-like second lower premolar, small and narrow upper and lower cheek teeth, and the presence of an additional antero-buccal cusp and a reduced paraconid on the lower molars. Ecology Apatemyids were arboreal, or tree-living mammals, occupying a niche filled by the modern-day aye-aye and woodpecker. Both the woodpecker and aye-aye are capable of penetrating wood to reach invertebrates, but the aye-aye does so by poking holes in the wood using its elongated incisors and then extracting the insects using its slender third digit. The highly specialized hands and teeth of apatemyids suggest they were able to pick the larvae of wood-boring insects out of trees in a similar manner. The elongated digits II and III allowed apatemyids to reach within the tiny crevices of tree bark and extract the larvae to feed on. Other behaviors of apatemyids resembled that of the modern-day squirrel or lemur. With narrow and long clawed toes, apatemyids were adapted for grasping to trees, which is a behavior consistent with arboreal mammals.

She is considered to be the first woman to receive an engineering diploma in the Netherlands and was one of the first three female city councillors in Delft.  Early life and education  Bes was born in Tilburg in 1882, the daughter of Klaas Bes and Johanna Bes (n√©e Stoel). Her father worked as a mathematics teacher at the Tilburg secondary school. After completing her primary school education in 1894, Bes became the first female student in Tilburg to be admitted to the secondary school. Permission for this had to be sought from, and granted by the minister. In 1899, she successfully completed her final school exams, and the following year she started as the first female student at the Polytechische School te Delft, studying in the Technology department. On 27 July 1904, Bes graduated in chemical engineering from the Polytechnic, becoming the first female graduate engineer in the Netherlands. That same year, she was appointed as an assistant in physics at her former college, which was upgraded in status to a technical college and renamed the Technische Hoogeschool Delft in 1905, to emphasise the academic quality of the education. In 1910 Bes became an assistant for theoretical and applied physics there, and in 1919 she was appointed as a permanent member of staff. In 1926 she left her job because of health issues.  Political career  In the 1910s, Bes became politically active, joining the Vrijzinnig Democratische Bond (VBD) (transl. Liberal Democratic League), a progressive liberal political party in the Netherlands. This led to Bes becoming was one of the founders of the national Vrijzinnig Democratic Vrouwenclub along with a number of women including Aletta Jacobs, a physician and leading women's suffrage activist. Bes was a member of the VBV's central board. In 1918, Bes ran as a candidate for the Liberal Democrats in the national Tweede Kamerverkiezingen elections held on the 21st May. The election was the first held after a series of reforms, known as \\"the Great Pacification\\" which introduced universal male suffrage and proportional representation, replacing the previous first-past-the-post voting in single member constituencies. Women could stand for election but were not able to vote themselves, only gaining that right in 1919. The liberal parties lost the most seats and Bes was not elected. The following year 1919 Bes became party leader for the VDB in the municipal elections in Delft. She received about two thirds of the total 182 votes cast for the party, and sat on the Delft city council until March 1920. She made a name for herself on the council as a campaigner for alcohol control.  Marriage and death On July 15, 1920, Bes married the Evangelical Lutheran pastor Theodoor Gotlieb Stellwag (1888-1935). The couple lived in the presbytery of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, a historic building at 253 Oude Delft. After her marriage, Bes became active at the Lutheran Church in Delft, where among other things she worked as a teacher in the Sunday school. After the death of her husband in 1935, Bes moved, with her maid, to The Hague, where she died on August 7, 1938 at the age of 56. Bes was buried in the Jaffa cemetery in Delft on August 10, 1938.  Commemoration  The Marie Besstraat, a street in Delft, was named after her in 1988. In 2017, Marie Bes was awarded a place in the Alumni Walk of Fame, created to celebrate the 175th anniversary of TU Delft, to celebrate her place as the first woman to graduate as an engineer from the University.

By many criteria he was the most successful lyricist in the German Democratic Republic between 1955, when he wrote his first song-text, and 1990. Since 1990 his work has been less to the fore, even though during the years of division a number of his songs became popular with Schlager fans in the west.  Biography  An orphan in wartime = Dieter Schneider was born in Berlin-Wei√üensee in 1937. His mother's identity is not known. The first year of his life was spent in the Stephanusstift orphanage. After a year a foster family was found for him. However, at the end of the summer of 1939, war broke out and his foster parents, convinced that they would be unable to support the infant through another war, \\"gave him back\\". Over the next few years much of his upbringing was disruptively institutionalised. He worked his way through the usual childhood illnesses, spending much of the war period in hospital. There was no scope, under the circumstances, for structured convalescence or restorative procedures. One of the diseases he underwent was the Spinal Polio which has left him physically handicapped. By 1945, when the war ended, he was an inmate at the Evangelical Johannes Orphanage in Berlin-Spandau, where he witnessed the destructive final months of the fighting and the arrival of the Soviet troops. But he had survived. The foster mother who had given him up in 1939 had also survived and now came looking for him. Having found him, she took him back into her home. Their walk across Berlin from Spandau to Wei√üensee took them through the heart of what had been a city. The boy had passed through his eighth birthday a few weeks earlier: memories of what he saw as he walked with his foster mother across the city would remain with him for the rest of his life. During the immediate post-war period there was no possibility of attending a school, but he learned to read and write, partly on his own and partly with the help of an uncle who was progressively losing his sight. Little Dieter used to read the newspaper to his uncle: the arrangement suited both of them. He was able to enroll at school locally in the fourth year, which under normal circumstances would have corresponded with 1948, the year of his eleventh birthday. It was immediately clear that he was different from the other children, presumably through some combination of his natural inclinations and his physical difficulties following Polio. While the others played outside or took part in \\"physical education\\" / gymnastics classes, Dieter stayed in the class room and worked on composing his first verses. = Transition years = Sources are vague over the final part of his school career, with suggestions that he became a serial truant, often taking time out to track down popular composers and offer them his hand-written verses, hoping they might become the basis for new popular songs. This involved a lot of walking the streets and a lot of knocking on doors, but success was limited. There is also mention of his having worked as an unpaid intern in various media businesses during the period between leaving school and becoming established in his chosen career, but it was nevertheless a difficult time. At one stage after his foster-mother died he found work as a trainee telephone operator. There were also more imaginative approaches that could be deployed when the money ran out. He discovered a coin operated telephone box at the Tiergarten (zoo) Train Station which, with a well practiced half-twist of the telephone dial, could be persuaded to spit out four telephone tokens. In the context of the intense austerity overhanging Berlin through the immediate post-war years, these could readily be exchanged for money's worth with local shops. = Career launch = His prospects improved when one of his song lyrics came to the attention of a man called - slightly improbably - Franz Schubert. Schubert worked for a music publisher turned record produced called Lied der Zeit (loosely, \\"Song of the Moment\\"). He arranged for the would-be songwriter to meet up with Hans Bath, a composer of Schlager music. The upshot of their meeting was a collaboration between the lyricist Schneider and the composer Bath on a song called \\"Wenn die Gro√üstadt schlafen geht\\" (\\"When the big city goes to sleep\\"), which appeared in 1955. The lyricist was still only 18. The first radio successes were not long in coming, and even though what followed was by no means a one-way street to fame and fortune, sound foundations had been set for a remarkable career. = Career success = Working always on a freelance basis, in the end he produced approximately 3,000 song lyrics, set to music by around 200 composers. Inevitably plenty of them were \\"bread and butter\\" texts, written because he needed the money, but his overall output also included many well known hits, performed by East Germany's new generation of popular singers. Some of Schneider's earlier successes were sung by Uta Bresan (\\"Ich w√ºnsch mir mehr als die Nacht\\" / \\"I wish for more than the night\\"), Chris Doerk (\\"Jedes junge M√§dchen wird mal gek√ºsst\\" / \\"Every young girl is kissed\\"), Monika Herz (\\"Kleiner Vogel\\" / \\"Little bird\\", \\"Charly ad√©\\"), Olaf Berger (\\"Es brennt wie Feuer\\" / \\"It burns like fire\\", \\"Es kommt so oder so\\" \\"It comes like this or like that\\"), Brigitte Ahrens (\\"Wo ist die liebe Sonne\\" / \\"Where the dear son is\\"), Hauff and Henkler (\\"Heut ist wieder Vollmond\\" / \\"Today it's full moon again\\") and Frank Sch√∂bel (\\"Looky, Looky\\", \\"Gold in deinen Augen\\" / \\"Gold in your eyes\\", \\"Ja, der Fu√üball ist rund wie die Welt\\" / \\"Yes, the football is round like the world\\"). He wrote several texts for songs that were performed by East German \\"Pionierchor Omnibus\\" (\\"Omnibus youth choir\\"), including \\"Endliche Ferien\\" (loosely, \\"Holidays at last\\"). His texts were also used by popular singers in West Germany. Examples included Renate Holm (\\"Lebe wohl, kleine Schwalbe\\" / \\"Fare well, little swallow\\"), Tina York (\\"Gib dem Gl√ºck eine Chance\\" / \\"Give luck a chance\\"), Marika Kilius (\\"Erst kam ein verliebter Blick\\" / \\"It started with a loving glance\\"), Manuela (\\"Wie viele Wege\\" / \\"So many ways\\", \\"Ich hab mich verliebt in dich\\" / \\"I fell in love with you\\"), the Jacob Sisters (\\"Sonne und Regen\\" / \\"Sunshine and rain\\"), the Hazy Osterwald sextet (\\"Looky, Looky\\"), Ted Herold (\\"Bin schon vergeben\\" / \\"Already taken\\"), Bruce Low (\\"Ein Souvenir aus Berlin\\") and Ralf Bendix (\\"Gott sei Dank ist sie schlank\\" / \\"Thank God she's slender\\"). Schneider also diversified into German-language versions of originally non-German songs which opened up the relatively large German- language market for Schlager songs to the most important songs by artistes whose mother tongue was not so widely used in central Europe. One of these was the Hungarian Zsuzsa Koncz with \\"Endlich, Endlich\\" (\\"At last, at last\\") and \\"Farbstifte\\" (\\"Colored crayons\\"). Others included the Warsaw band, \\"Czerwone Gitary\\" (\\"Red Guitars\\") with their hit song \\"Anna Maria\\", Lili Ivanova from Sofia with \\"Bunte Wagen\\" (\\"Colorful cars\\") and Karel Gott from Prague with \\"F√§llt ein Stern aufs Meer\\" (\\"If a star falls onto the sea\\"). Success within the world of Schlager-style popular music was als marked by a large number of prizes, both nationally and at international song competition festivals. Dieter Schneider won the \\"Golden Orpheus\\" prize in Bulgaria and the \\"Bratslava Lyre\\" prize in Czechoslovakia. Closer to home he was a winner of the National Arts Prize (Kunstpreis) of the German Democratic Republic. For nearly ten years Dieter Schneider was the editor in charge of the popular \\"sailors' series\\", Klock 8, achtern Strom, transmitted from the East German Television studio at Rostock, a ninety minute \\"feel-good\\" Schlager music show (which some western commentators thought flagrantly copied its format from equivalent West German television programmes). Through his song lyrics and songs, he was also centrally involved in various other East German television entertainment shows such as Ein Kessel Buntes and Da liegt Musike drin. = Germany unified = After reunification in 1990 Schnieder successfully negotiated the reconfiguration of the country's music business, with new songs for performers such as Dagmar Frederic, Edith Prock, Gerd Christian, Wolfgang Edenharder and \\"Little Toni\\" from De Randfichten. Nevertheless, although he sustained his career in the newly enlarged Germany, the beating heart of his fan base continues to rest in the so-called \\"Neue Bundesl√§nder\\" (\\"New Federal States\\") - those parts of Germany that before 1990 comprised East Germany.

Life He was the son of the stockbroker Alexander Trotter and his first wife Jacqueline Otter, daughter of William Otter, born on 1 August 1837 in Hampstead; the electrical engineer Alexander Pelham Trotter was his half-brother, and Henry Dundas Trotter his uncle. He was educated at Harrow School, and matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1855, graduating B.A. in 1859, and M.A. in 1862. Trotter was elected a Fellow of Trinity College in 1861. In 1863 he was ordained deacon to a curacy in Kidderminster, where he stayed for two years. He then went to Germany to study experimental physics under Hermann von Helmholtz and Gustav Kirchhoff. After spending some further time in Italy, he returned to Trinity College, where in 1869 he was appointed lecturer in physical science, a post which he held until 1884. Settled in Cambridge, Trotter became an influential figure in university administrative affairs, in part because of a polymathic understanding of academic subjects. From 1874 onwards he was a member of the council of the Senate of the university. There were changes in the statutes in 1882, and his role was particularly important for the increased attention to natural science. He was a reformer, and in politics a Liberal. The drive for reform began in Trinity College itself, after William Whewell died in 1866, where Trotter had allies in Henry Sidgwick and Henry Jackson.Gerald L. Geison, 4. Foster Meets Cambridge: Trinity College, University Reform, and the Rise of Laboratory Science, book chapter, pp. 81‚Äì115, at p. 99. In Trinity, Trotter became junior dean in 1870, and senior dean in 1874. He was tutor of his college from 1872 to 1882, and was appointed its vice-master in 1885. He died unmarried in Trinity College on 4 December 1887:at the time he was president of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, and vice-president of the council of Newnham College. He left much of his library, with a bequest in money, to Trinity College, and the remainder of his library and his collection of scientific instruments to Newnham College. Legacy From the time of Trotter's death, Trinity College has offered the Coutts Trotter studentship, supported by a bequest of ¬£7,000. The chosen areas were experimental physics and physiology. It was held, for example, by Ernest Rutherford.

Specifically, Carpodaptes can be found between the Tiffanian and Clarkforkian periods of North America. Although little evidence, this genus may have made it through to the early Eocene. They are known primarily from collections of jaw and teeth fragments in North America, mainly in southwestern Canada and northwestern America. Carpodaptes are estimated to have weighed approximately 53-96 grams which made them a little bigger than a mouse. However small, Carpodaptes was a placental mammal within the order Plesiadapiformes that appeared to have a high fiber diet. This insect-eating mammal may have been one of the first to evolve fingernails in place of claws. This may have helped them pick insects, nuts, and seeds more easily off the ground than with paws or claws. Carpodaptes was thought to only exist in North America but recent discoveries of dentition fragments have been found in China. Dentition The fossil record of Carpodaptes is relatively sparse excluding jaw and teeth fragments. However, much can be concluded off of these few fragments. Their upper jaw had a dental formula of 2:1:3:3 and 2:1:2:3 on their lower jaw. Carpodaptes are characterized by their plagiaulacoid dentition seen on their first lower premolar. Their p4 had 5-7 apical cusps depending on the specimen. This enlarged p4 would have potentially allowed the mammal to have crack open nuts and seeds as well as act as a slicing function on invertebrates. Their p3 is characterized by lingual apical cusps that are flattened and sometimes even concave. In some species of Carpodaptes, their upper M1 indicates a specialized wedging function that acts in accordance with their p4. The varying development of dentition between Carpodaptes species indicates they were adapting their teeth to conform with a high fiber diet. However, their teeth are still rather primitive in comparison to other early-diverging primatomorphans of this era. Carpodaptes are also recognized by the loss of their p2, and some species even show to have a shortening of their mandible to potentially exert a greater biting force. Finally, their upper molars are studded and file-like which would have assisted with breaking open nuts and seeds. Taxonomy and phylogeny Carpodaptes is part of an early diverging group of primates that lived approximately 60 million years ago. This genus was first identified in 1921 by Matthew and Granger. They are sister taxa to Carpolestes and Carpocristes. Carpocristes, unlike Carpolestes and Carpodaptes, dominated Asia whereas the other two thrived in North America. Within the genus, 7 species have been identified: Carpodaptes aulacodon, Carpodaptes cygneus, Carpodaptes hazelae, Carpodaptes hobackensis, Carpodaptes jepseni, Carpodaptes rosei, and Carpodaptes stonleyi. It was originally thought that Carpodaptes was a subset of the genus Carpocristes until recent discoveries found the progression of ridges, serrations, and apical cusps more well defined in Carpodaptes than Carpocristes. This suggests that Carpocristes diverges from an earlier common ancestor with Carpodaptes rather than Carpodaptes being a direct descendant of Carpocristes. The brief connection of North America with Europe could help explain how Carpodaptes expanded to Asian localities, however it is perplexing that no fossil evidence has been recovered from European regions. This may suggest Carpodaptes survived more efficiently in a warm and dry climate than a warm and moist one. Paleoecology Carpodaptes prospered during the late Paleocene and some species made it through the early Eocene. Fragments of Carpodaptes have been notably found in the Swan Hills of Canada, Big Horn Basin, and Clark Forks Basin in Wyoming. This suggests that Carpodaptes lived in a subtropical, humid climate in which there would have been plenty of flora to seek refuge from larger animals. This coincides with the hypothesis that Carpodaptes mainly consumed fruits and nuts as there is a corresponding diversification of plant species in the late Paleocene. At the same time, insects began to recover from the Paleocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum which allowed Carpodaptes to expand into broader niches with a broader dietary requirement. The radiation of insect herbivores in the late Paleocene is a possible explanation of a rise in CO2 levels at the end of the Paleocene. This would have been in part of Carpodaptes radiation into scansorial insectivores. It could also explain why many species of Carpodaptes did not survive through the Paleocene-Eocene boundary.

History AACA Museum, Inc. was formed in 1993 as a public charitable organization with a mission to construct a museum to preserve all forms of historical motor vehicles. In 1996, the incorporation purchased 25 acres of land near the national club headquarters located in Hershey, Pennsylvania to be used as the site for the future museum building. Initial costs for the building were estimated at $11 million, and in 2000, the William J. Cammack Supporting Organization Trust pledged a multi-million dollar testamentary commitment, along with three 1947 Tucker Torpedo automobiles. Much of the rest of the fundraising was accomplished during the AACA annual car shows hosted in Hershey, PA. The museum opened on June 26, 2003 with roughly 70 cars donated, or on loan from, the club's members. Rather than display their cars in long rows, the AACA Museum incorporated an educational approach in its displays by adding scenery and set designs that complement the period in which each car was built.

Born in Heidenheim an der Brenz, Loderer undertook an apprenticeship as a metal cloth maker, but was called up to served in the navy before he could complete this. He served until May 1945, when he was captured by the British. He returned to his former career, and joined the Iron and Metal Industry Association, which soon became part of IG Metall. He joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD), and gradually rose to more prominent positions in the union. From 1959, he was its district secretary for youth work and shop stewards. IG Metall was affiliated to the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB), and in 1963, Loderer was elected as the federation's Baden-W√ºrttemberg district secretary. In 1966, he took a leading role in an anti-fascist rally outside the conference of the National Democratic Party of Germany, and this propelled him to national attention. In 1968, Loderer was elected as deputy president of IG Metall, with the backing of president Otto Brenner. He was the union's lead on public relations, human resources, organisation, and administration. Brenner died in 1972, and Loderer was elected as his successor. While Loderer initially campaigned on issues such as banning lockouts, and expanding the role of workers in company management, the economic crisis led him to a more defensive position, and a focus on collective bargaining. He also presided over five major strikes. He was staunchly opposed to communists in the union, or to any co-operation with unions affiliated to the communist World Federation of Trade Unions, and criticised the peace movement for not spending enough time attacking the Soviet Union. In 1974, Loderer was elected as president of the International Metalworkers' Federation. He was elected in the European Parliament election, 1979, for the SPD in Hesse, but he stood down in January 1980, as he found the workload was incompatible with remaining leader of the union. He retired from his trade union roles in 1983, and later moved back to Heidenheim.

Thomas Short (1690‚Äì1772) was an English physician, epidemiologist, and medical historian. He is known for writing extensively on population theory and the history of disease outbreaks affecting England.  Life and career  A draft deed indicates Thomas Short was the son of a merchant named James Short. From an early point in Thomas's life he was interested in chemistry and mineral water, and as a young man was educated in medicine at Trinity College in Oxford. After his studies he either practiced medicine or was counseled in Coventry from 1723 to 1728, and Short began officially working as a physician in Sheffield around 1725 or 1728. He published books about what he learned as a doctor treating patients. One of Short's earliest publications, in 1728, was medical literature on the negative health effects of obesity: In A Discourse concerning the causes and effects of Corpulency, etc he writes about how fat separates from the blood and why some individuals are more vulnerable to health problems than others. Short was at a prolific stage of writing medical literature by the 1740s. Retaining his interest in mineral waters from early in his life, he began the decade by publishing An Essay Towards a Natural, Experimental, and Medicinal History of the Principle Mineral Waters. In 1746, he published Medicine Britannica: Or, a Treatise on such Physical Plants as are Generally to be Found in the Fields or Gardens in Great Britain. One of his more famous works was published at the end of the decade in 1749, A General Chronological History of the Air, Weather, Seasons, Meteors, &c.;, in Sundry Places and Different Times: More Particularly for the Space of 250 Years: Together with Some of Their Most Remarkable Effects on Animal (especially Human) Bodies and Vegetables. His descriptions of sixteenth century influenza pandemics in Europe, their pathologies, and recorded treatments have been cited by medical historians. Short's works were also read by contemporaries such as Benjamin Franklin. In 1750, at age 60, Short had his Discourses on Tea, Sugar, Milk, Made-Wines, Spirits, Punch, Tobacco with Plain and Useful Rules for Gouty People published. The same year he also published New Observations, Natural, Moral, Civil, Political, and Medical, on City, Town, and Country Bills of Mortality, his first publication where Short focused his demographic interests discussing how diseases affected and altered populations. This was the checkpoint in his literary career where he became known for his writings on population theory. In 1762, Short moved to Rotherham, where he lived for 10 years before dying in 1772.

He was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. His father Robert Rivard was an actor. Michel began his career at an early age appearing in a Canadian television series (Rue des Pignons) and in TV commercials. Rivard's career as a writer and composer began in earnest when he became a member of the theatrical group Quenouille Bleue, established in 1970. Later, he became a member of Th√©√¢tre Sainfoin, when it was founded in 1973. Beau Dommage and beyond In 1974, Rivard and other members of Th√©√¢tre Sainfoin, formed the group Beau Dommage (an old Qu√©b√©cois expression meaning \\"certainly\\" or \\"damn right\\"). Rivard wrote and composed for Beau Dommage. Beau Dommage became a very popular group, and as a result of his songwriting ability Rivard's popularity increased as well. Perhaps his most popular song from this era is \\"La complainte du phoque en Alaska\\". Although Beau Dommage disbanded in 1978, there were reunion concerts in 1984 and 1994, both of which Rivard participated in. Characteristic of Rivard's creative energy, he also put out his first solo album in 1977, M√©fiez-vous du grand amour. In 1978, as a sign of his increased prestige, Michel opened for Maxime Le Forestier and was accompanist for Forestier at the Olympia in Paris. Although an unlikely pairing, it resulted in a continued friendship. Rivard released his second LP, De Longueuil √† Berlin, in 1979; that year also marked the beginning of Rivard's appearance in a series of concerts in Paris. The 1980s The following years saw Rivard involved in various collaborations, including film collaborations. These film collaborations included roles in Les Enfants de Kennedy, and Maria Chapdelaine. He also wrote scores for films, such as Andr√© Melan√ßon's L'Espace d'un √©t√©, and Jean-Michel Ribes's Rien ne va plus. He also acted playing the lead Yves Simoneau's Pourquoi l'√©trange Monsieur Zolock s'int√©ressait-il tant √† la bande dessin√©e? (Why is the Strange Mr. Zolock so interested in Comic Strips?) (1982). He joined the LNI (Ligue nationale d'improvisation [National Improvisation League]) in 1980 and performed for several years. Not wanting to miss an opportunity for some political humour, Rivard was a candidate for the satirical Rhinoceros Party of Canada in 1980 when he ran against former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He returned to music in 1983 with the release of his third LP, Sauvage. This LP included \\"Schefferville, le dernier train\\", a tune that became quite popular and which was written for the film Le Dernier glacier. (Rivard also acted in this film). Rivard made a music video of another song on Sauvage: \\"Rumeurs sur la ville\\". It was directed by Louis Saia and Andr√© Gagnon and won the F√©lix Video Clip of the Year for 1985 ‚Äì awarded at the ADISQ (Association du disque, de l'industrie du spectacle qu√©b√©cois et de la vid√©o)ADISQ was created to promote the Quebec recording industry and its artists. The first president of ADISQ, Gilles Talbot, launched the idea of an annual gala because many Qu√©b√©cois artists were dissatisfied with the fact that they were only rarely nominated to compete in the annual Juno Awards. award ceremonies. During this time Rivard toured Quebec. He released a fourth LP, called Bonsoir... Mon nom est Michel Rivard et voici mon album double. This was a live recording made during his 1983 and 1984 concerts. These live show recordings display his adeptness at comic improvisation as well as his musical creativity. In December 1988 Rivard played the Convocation Hall in Toronto. It was the first time in ten years that a Qu√©b√©cois sang in French there. Rivard continued to garner awards: In 1988 he won two more F√©lix awards \\"Concert of the Year\\" and \\"Male Singer of the Year.\\" He also participated in concerts supporting political and humanitarian issues, among them: the Amnesty International concert \\"Human Rights Now!\\" along with Youssou N'Dour, Tracy Chapman, Bruce Springsteen, and others. What was to become his most popular album, Un trou dans les nuages was issued in late 1987. It included songs that would be enduring hits for him: \\"Ma blonde et les poissons\\", \\"Lib√©rer le tr√©sor\\", \\"Je voudrais voir la mer\\", \\"Le priv√©\\", and \\"Un trou dans les nuages\\". Rivard received many awards for this album including the Charles-Cros Academie International Grand Prize. Rivard released another album in 1989, Michel Rivard a compilation of greatest hits. He continued to perform concerts in Canada and Europe. The 1990s Rivard's seventh album Le go√ªt de l'eau‚Ä¶et autres chansons na√Øves came out in 1992. It too became another award-winning album for him and in 1993 Rivard performed at the Olympia theatre in Paris. At this point in time Rivard's prominence as a creative musician and poetic lyricist with a broad humanitarian vision put him on a par with the two great performers of a previous Qu√©b√©cois generation, Gilles Vigneault and F√©lix Leclerc. Rivard's \\"Complainte du phoque en Alaska\\"' was one of the few songs recorded by Leclerc that Leclerc did not write himself. Rivard also shares with those two men, though more moderately, a concern and interest in Quebec's nationalist aspirations. In 1998, Rivard released the haunting and personal Maudit Bonheur. He had his own variety television show, Studio TV5, for a couple of years, where he invited musicians, songwriters, and singers that he enjoyed performing with and jammed with them. The 2000s Rivard's concert career continues and he also continues to perform in theatre. In 2002 his album Simple (a live concert album) came out, and in 2004 Bonsoir‚Ä¶mon nom est toujours Michel Rivard et voici mon album quadrupleWhile Rivard's CDs are available in Canadian music stores that carry Qu√©b√©cois performers, they are not at all available through major international distributors, such as Amazon.

Political career  Karad fought elections from his native Latur rural (Vidhan Sabha constituency), which was part of Renapur assembly constituency. Renapur was influenced by then BJP leader Gopinath Munde. Karad is a follower of Munde. Latur rural constituency was created in 2009 by division of Renapur and Latur constituencies. Karad kept the party alive in Latur rural after the death of Munde. It was not easy to face then chief minister late Vilasrao Deshmukh directly. But Karad fought alone in Latur rural. Karad is dreaming to be a legislator since 2009 due to Karad family's legacy and organization in rural region. He fought 2009 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election, in which Vaijnath Shinde of Indian National Congress defeated Karad by 23,500 votes. Trimbak Bhise of INC defeated Karad in 2014 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election by 10,500 votes. But Karad didn't leave hope after two consecutive defeats. He continuously remained in contact with his voters. In 2018 legislative council election, he filed a nomination from Nationalist Congress Party against Suresh Dhas of BJP. But he shocked NCP leader Dhananjay Munde, by drawing back nomination and returning to Pankaja Munde's group. Environment was set in 2019 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election. He started works as per the orders of the party. Karad's followers had been claiming openly that, BJP left the seat to Shiv Sena to ease the victory of congress leader Dhiraj Deshmukh. Since then Karad didn't appear in the election. But the party attempted to remove his upset by giving him designation of district president for Latur rural . He filed nomination papers for legislative council election along with three other BJP members in 2020.

The year Simon joined Pfizer, the company paid the largest ever health care fraud settlement in DOJ‚Äôs history (totaling $2.3 billion) for fraudulent marketing of a drug. In 2007 Simon co-founded medical research think tank FasterCures with Michael Milken. Milken received a pardon from President Trump in 2020 after being convicted of illegal trading that collapsed investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert. The Milken Institute has been a leading proponent of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúopportunity zones‚Äù policy ‚Äî tax breaks aimed at encouraging investment and real estate purchase in economically distressed areas. In at least one instance, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin directly intervened to help Milken profit from an opportunity zone designation. After resigning as Trump‚Äôs FDA Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb quickly joined the boards of FasterCures and Pfizer. In addition to Gottlieb, FasterCure‚Äôs board includes executives from Citi, Google, Deloitte, Pfizer, and the Heritage Foundation. In the same year that he co-founded FasterCures, he also co-founded the Melanoma Research Alliance with Leon Black, Milken‚Äôs former Drexel colleague and current CEO of vulture fund Apollo Global Management. In Joe Biden‚Äôs 2020 U.S Presidential Campaign, Simon represented Biden at a surrogate fundraiser in February 2020.

Often associated with his younger brother Andrea, he was active in Lombardy, Venice and Trentino. He was known for his bronze, wood and marble creations, and considered the premier sculptor in early sixteenth century Brescia. Artistic re-examination During the twentieth century, Olivieri was the subject of a misunderstanding in the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia, after Antonio Morassi, in two studies of the 1930s, transformed his biography from that of a bronze artist and woodcarver to the principal Brescian stone sculptor of the early 16th century. The reconstruction, based on an incorrect assumption, i.e. the dating of the Martinengo mausoleum, and conducted purely deductively without the aid of documentary sources, generated considerable confusion in the attribution and cultural framework of many works of art. Only from 1977, with the archival researches of Camillo Boselli, was Maffeo Olivieri's oeuvre restored to its correct artistic sphere, following the organic reconsideration of Gasparo Cairano and his work. Works The Botticino Crucifix (located at the Diocesan Museum of Brescia) has been attributed to Olivieri, as well as the Erbusco Crucifix, and the crosses of Lograto and Ghedi. The cross of Sarezzo was executed by Olivieri on the basis of a contract signed on 9 June 1538 for its construction. The wooden statues of Saint Catherine of Alexandria and of Saint Bernard (in Brescia) as well as of Saint Sebastian in Gargnano's Church of San Martino (1530‚Äî1535) are also due to him. In the province of Cremona, in the Church of Santa Maria del Boschetto (Soresina), Olivieri has been identified as the creator of the wooden statuary of the Saints Siro, Giobbe, Rocco and Peter the Martyr, as well as the sculpture of Sant'Antonio Abate located in the sacristy. Maffeo Olivieri, Medallion of Altobello AveroldiIn the region of Trentino, Olivieri's first work may have been the altar at Tione di Trento (1515) with the statues of the Madonna and Child with Saints Sebastian and Rocco. This was in collaboration with his brother Andrea, who appears to have assisted him in all his works in the area. Between 1520-1530, he built the wooden altar at the Church of Santa Lucia in Giustino. This was previously attributed to Stefano Lamberti. The current structure does not correspond to the original one and likely the group of about twelve sculptures and reliefs, came from two different altars. The statues of Santa Lucia and Sant'Agata, part of the original complex, are currently preserved in the Diocesan Museum of Trento. From the parish of Nago-Torbole come the wooden statues of two Deacons, also preserved in the Diocesan Museum of Trento, after being recovered from its archives and restored. His greatest work in wood carving is considered the monumental altarpiece of the Assunta carved and painted for the church of Santa Maria at Condino, which he began in 1538 and Andrea completed in 1546. Matteo Olivieri was also a fine bronze-worker in the classical vein. His greatest work in this field are the two candelabra, dated and signed, placed on the sides of the altar of the Chapel of the Madonna of the Mascoli in St Mark's Basilica in Venice, donated by the Brescian Cardinal Altobello de Averoldi. He also created various bronze statuettes in the style of Andrea Briosco: a Bust of a woman, and a Venus with Cupid, now in the Louvre museum, a Meleager in the Museum of Piazza Venezia in Rome. He also produced many medallions, including one for Altobello de Averoldi (around 1520) and others for Venetian patricians; also medallions with allegorical subjects, such as one from the Kress collection and kept at the National Gallery of Art, Washington. His style has been related to Francesco Giolfino, a Veronese carver active in Brescia in the first half of the sixteenth century. =Works reattributed to others= The bronze and stone apparatus of the Mausoleum of Martinengo in the Museum of Santa Giulia, Brescia, the ark of Sant'Appollonio in the Duomo Nuovo of Brescia, the altar of San Girolamo at the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi were all restored to Gasparo Cairano's oeuvre in the 2000s, while the bronze statues of the Martinengo mausoleum have been shown to be the works of Bernardino delle Croci. The funeral monuments of Altobello de Averoldi and Raffaele Riario in the Santi Nazaro e Celso, Brescia were reattributed to Lorenzo Bregno in 1990.

It was part of a branch line off the main line between Belfast and Dublin, connecting to Droghedahttps://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf. This line was connected to the Midland Great Western line from Clonsilla to Navan in 1862. The Oldcastle line itself was not opened until March 17, 1863 and served for a hundred years. According to commemorative plaques on the site of the old station, the line was just under 13 miles long, took two and a half years to build, and cost ¬£73,683,14s,3d. History Oldcastle's train yard consisted of a warehouse and station master's house built in Italianate style. By the early 1910s, four trains operated on the line; none on Sundays. The station handled parcels, passengers, furniture, carriages, portable engines, and livestock, serving as the heart of Oldcastle's market economy. The station had a crane capable of lifting 3 tons. According to commemorative plaques, the rail line was also useful for locals who traveled in and out of Oldcastle; the workhouse would use the line to send patients down to Dublin for specialised treatments. In 1895, a \\"development committee\\" promoted the rail line as a means of boosting tourism in Oldcastle. During World War I, Oldcastle housed a detention camp for prisoners of war. On 12 December 1914, the rail line was used to transport 68 German prisoners into the town. Two days later, another 26 civilians were moved into the camp. This continued steadily from late 1914 to 1915; 304 inmates were in the camp by February 1915. This number increased to 579 by June 1916. This was reported on by the Meath Chronicle, writing 'The long expected German prisoners arrived this week in Oldcastle and took up quarters in the disused workhouse'. John Smith also wrote an article on the subjectThe Oldcastle Prisoner of War Camp 1914‚Äì1918, John Smith, Riocht Na Midhe ‚Äì Records of Meath Archaeological and History Society 2010, Vol XX1. In 1950, nationalisation of CI√â (the State transport company in the Republic) threatened the existence of several lines, and in April 1958, the Oldcastle railway lost its passenger service. For most of its history, steam locomotives operated on the Oldcastle railway, but between 1949 and 1960, huge investment was made in diesel engines. On 30 April 1963, goods transport was closed and the line was dead. Dismantlement and legacy After 1963, the Oldcastle line was left to deteriorate. Most tracks were ripped up but a single-arch bridge, Cooney's Bridge, built over the line in the late 1800s remains intact to this day (the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage argues that the bridge was built in 1880 but carvings in the bridge's stonework clearly date it back to 1862). The station master's house is now a private residence. The train yard has been broken up between the Oldcastle Co-Operative Limited and Gleneagle Woodcraft Limited In the late 2010s, the Oldcastle Tidy Towns Committee created a garden and set up plaques in commemoration of Oldcastle Railway. Oldcastle Co-Operative co-funded the community project. The old station's crane was restored and placed in the garden.

History Located in front of Retiro railway station, Plaza Canad√° was conceived by the Argentina-Canada Cultural Institute and was dedicated in July 1961. A carved totem pole that was donated by the Canadian government stands in the center of the plaza. The totem pole sits as a tribute to the shared Indigenous heritages found in both Canada and Argentina. Canadian totem Original totem pole in 2006 After the plaza was named, Canadian Ambassador Richard Plant Bower worked to arrange the delivery of a totem pole from Canada to Buenos Aires. In 1963, Kwakiutl carvers Henry Hunt and his son Tony Hunt Sr. were commissioned by Ambassador Bower to carve a totem pole for the plaza. Carved from a 2,000-year old British Columbia red cedar, the totem pole depicted an eagle, a killer whale, a sea lion, a beaver, and a cannibal bird called a hok hok. After being shipped to Buenos Aires, the pole was erected in Plaza Canad√° in May 1964. By the early 2000s, the totem pole had severely deteriorated, and in 2008 Hern√°n Lombardi, the Minister of Culture for the City of Buenos Aires, announced that restoration project would be started for the totem pole. The totem pole was cut down from its stand in the plaza and cut into pieces to facilitate repair. However, by the time restoration efforts took place, the totem pole had deteriorated beyond repair leading the city government to request a new totem pole. In 2011, the Argentine Embassy to Canada sought for a carver from the Hunt family to carve the new totem pole. Stanley C. Hunt, a son of Henry Hunt, was commissioned to carve the new totem pole. The new totem pole was carved from a 1,500-year old five-ton British Columbia red cedar and depicts a double-headed serpent called a sisiutl, a bear holding a halibut, a chief holding a copper shield, a killer whale, and a chief holding the creator raven.

Career Graydon was graduate from the Classical course at Butler University in 1878 and began teaching Greek at a school in Indianapolis school replacing her own professor, John O. Hopkins, after his death in November 1877. In 1883 she gained her master's degree from Indiana University Bloomington and was subsequently appointed as the assistant professor of Latin and Greek there. Graydon's teaching career at Indiana was cut short after her relationship with Lemuel Moss, President of the university, was exposed by a group of students who spied on the couple through peep holes drilled into the attic above her seminar room. The relationship was published in several national newspapers. Graydon resigned under protest, stating that Moss had threatened her with dismissal from her position if she refused his advances. Moss did not contest his dismissal and fled Indiapolis, even before his family could sell their home. Graydon briefly attended Radcliffe College in 1885-1886 but returned to Indianapolis before the end of her studies due to poor health. After a gap of two years from academia, Graydon joined Hastings College, Nebraska in 1888 where she remained until 1892. After 1892 she spent several years as a private tutor for the children of naturalist John Muir, whom she had known since childhood through his links with her aunt Catharine Merrill. After studying, but not graduating, from the University of Chicago in 1898‚Äì1899, Graydon took up a position as teacher of Greek and English at Oahu College in Honolulu. She remained in this position until 1907 when she returned to Butler University to take up a chair in English, named after her by-then deceased aunt Catherine Merrill. In 1928 she received an honorary doctorate in literature from the college. Whilst at Butler, Graydon edited the Butler Alumnal Quarterly from its first edition in 1922 until her retirement in 1929. During the First World War she kept correspondence with Butler students and alumni serving abroad and published these letters, with details of Butler men who had served in the American Civil War and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, in a 1922 volume. The book was intended to raise funds for memorials to those who had died in these conflicts. Graydon died in 1934 and was buried at Crown Hill Cemetery. =Legacy= Her effect on her students was so profound that former students formed a Katharine Merrill Graydon Club which met off-campus during and after her lifetime.

She was the first female fellow of the Institution of Structural Engineers. Chatterton designed some of Zimbabwe's first skyscrapers. Biography She was born Marjem or Marynia Znamirowska in Warsaw, Poland, in 1916, as an Orthodox Jew. In 1932 the family emigrated to Palestine. Chatterton had intended returning to Poland but by 1934 it was clear that the situation was becoming dangerous for Jews in Poland so Chatterton attended the Technion ‚Äì the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa to study engineering. Chatterton's aunt Rachel Shalon was on faculty there. Chatterton graduated from her civil engineering course in 1939 and began working in the Technical Office of the Collective Settlements Association. By 1947 Chatterton had married a British man, Frank Chatterton, and they moved with their family to Southern Rhodesia. Chatterton got a job working as a reinforced concrete designer immediately. Chatterton was working with Lysaght and Company until 1957 when she initially started consulting. In 1969 she established her consulting firm, M. Chatterton and Partners. Chatterton used her experience with concrete to design some of Zimbabwe's first skyscrapers, banks and building societies as well as cotton, fertiliser, and sugar industrial buildings. During this time Chatterton became a member of the Institution of Structural Engineers. She was the first woman to win the Andrews Prize and also won the Wallace Premium Prize. In 1954 she became the Institute's first female fellow. When the political situation in Zimbabwe deteriorated in 1976 Chatterton moved to Leeds to work in the University as a lecturer. Chatterton was involved in encouraging girls into engineering careers through the university's and girl's schools campaign. Chatterton returned to her consultancy in Zimbabwe in 1984. She also took on a teaching role in the national university. The country's independence in 1980 ensured development investment and building projects. Chatterton's last big project was the tallest office building, the 26-storey Reserve Bank. Chatterton continued working until 1999 when the political situation again became unstable and she retired and returned to the UK. Chatterton died on 27 January 2010. She is buried in Exeter.

She served in World War II as well as a variety of domestic missions. After decommissioning she was acquired by the Dominican Republic Navy and renamed Almirante Didiez Burgos. She is still active as the flagship of the Dominican Navy.  Construction and characteristics  USCGC Buttonwood buoy deck Buttonwood was built by the Marine Iron and Shipbuilding Company of Duluth, Minnesota. Her original cost was $880,018. Her keel was laid down on October 5, 1942, and she was launched on May 20, 1943. She was christened by Duluth's war loan campaign queen Mary Elizabeth Peterson. She was commissioned in Duluth on September 24, 1943. Her hull was constructed of welded steel plates, framed with steel I-beams. As originally built, Buttonwood was long, with a beam of , and a draft of . Her displacement was 935 tons. While her overall dimensions remained the same over her career, the addition of new equipment raised her displacement to 1,025 tons by the end of her Coast Guard service. Buttonwood had a single propeller driven by a diesel-electric propulsion system. Two Cooper-Bessemer GND-8 4-cycle 8-cylinder Diesel engines produced 600 horsepower each. They provided power to two Westinghouse generators. The electricity from the generators ran an electric motor which turned the propeller. She had a single cargo boom which could lift 20 tons onto her buoy deck. The ship's fuel tanks had a capacity of approximately . Buttonwood's unrefueled range was at 13 knots, at 12 knots, and at 8.3 knots. Her potable water tanks had a capacity of . Considering dry storage capacity and other factors, her at-sea endurance was 21 days. Her wartime complement was 6 officers and 74 enlisted men. By 1964 this was reduced to 5 officers, 2 warrant officers, and 47 enlisted personnel. Ironwood was armed with a 3\\"/50 caliber gun mounted behind the pilot house. She also had two 20mm guns, one mounted on top of the wheelhouse and one on the aft deck. Two racks of depth charges were also mounted on the aft deck. All of her on-deck armament was removed by 1966, leaving only small arms for law enforcement actions. At the time of construction, Buttonwood was designated WAGL, an auxiliary vessel, lighthouse tender. The designation was system was changed in 1965, and Buttonwood was redsignated WLB, an oceangoing buoy tender. Her namesake was the American sycamore, Platanus occidentalis, often referred to as buttonwood because its fine-grained wood was used to make buttons that resisted cracking.  World War II service  After her launch and commissioning in Duluth, Buttonwood sailed down the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River to reach the Atlantic. She arrived at the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland on November 1, 1943, where she had her armament and sensors installed. From here she sailed through the Panama Canal to join the Third Fleet. She arrived at Guadalcanal on May 1, 1944 via the Galapagos Islands, Bora Bora, and Espiritu Santo. She was assigned to Naval Base Tulagi. Her primary mission was to establish and maintain aids to navigation. On June 1, 1944 Buttonwood was sent south to Australia where she built and repaired a number of light structures. She departed in mid-September for Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea where she worked on aids to navigation until mid-October. Buttonwood reached San Pedro Bay in Leyte Gulf in the Philippines during an air raid on November 4, 1944. This was two weeks after US ground forces had landed in the Philippines and the area was still contested. Buttonwood endured 269 attacks by Japanese aircraft, including 11 air raids in one day. On November 24, 1944 she shot down a twin-engine bomber with her 3\\" gun. On November 26 she shot down another plane. When not engaged by air raids, Buttonwood charted the surrounding waters and placed buoys to guide Allied ships. On Christmas Day 1944 Buttonwood sailed for the nearby Guiuan Bay. She arrived in time to see the Dutch vessel MV Sommeisdijk torpedoed by a Japanese aircraft. The ship burned furiously as its cargo of lumber caught fire. Buttonwood assisted in firefighting and rescued 182 men from the burning ship. In between air raids, she continued her surveying and buoy tending activities in Guiuan Bay, Lauaan Bay, and San Pedro Bay. She sailed to Australia for repairs at the end of March 1945, but was back in the Philippines on June 12, 1945. She continued with her work maintaining aids to navigation in the Leyte Gulf area until August 22, 1945.  Post-war service  Honolulu, Hawaii was Buttonwood's homeport after the war. She maintained aids to navigation in Hawaiian waters but also ranged widely in the central and western Pacific on similar duties. In 1953, for instance, Buttonwood took a two-month cruise to maintain buoys in Samoa, and Kanton, Jarvis, Enderbury, Baker, and Howland Islands. The ship also brought supplies to remote LORAN stations throughout the Pacific, such as the one at French Frigate Shoals. Buttonwood was also responsible for search and rescue activities. She towed a number of disabled vessels back to port including Sea Dragon in June 1951 and Yellow Fin in 1952. Most of her tows were broken down fishing boats, but in 1971 she brought the yacht Graybeard safely to port after she lost her rudder during that year's Transpac Race. In September 1956 Buttonwood rescued 16 crewmen of a Navy Lockheed Super Constellation that had ditched about 100 miles short of Guam. In 1970 she rescued the 18-man crew of a Japanese ship that had gone aground on Laysan Island. Buttonwood was called on to support other Coast Guard missions. She enforced fishing regulations several times in Hawaiian water with both Japanese and Russian violators.. The King of Tonga was given passage home by Buttonwood after a regional conference in 1976.. In February 1981 Buttonwood sailed from Hawaii for the last time. She was transferred to Galveston, Texas where she replaced the USCGC Blackthorn, which was sunk in a collision with an oil tanker the previous year. USCGC Buttonwood crew mess after SLEP upgrade Buttonwood arrived in Galveston on April 9, 1981. Her primary mission was servicing more than 135 aids to navigation in Texas and Louisiana waters. This duty was particularly difficult in the wake of Hurricanes Alicia and Danny which did significant damage. The ship also cooperated with NOAA to maintain weather buoys in the Gulf of Mexico. She was part of the Coast Guard response to the oil spill from the Norwegian tanker Mega Borg in 1990. On April 15, 1991 Buttonwood sailed from Galveston for the Coast Guard Yard for a major overhaul as part of the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). She was replaced in Galveston by USCGC Papaw . The SLEP refit was extensive. The hull was sand-blasted, inspected, and repaired where corrosion warranted. A bow thruster was added to improve maneuverability. Living quarters were modernized. Additional space was provided for female sailors. New navigational electronics were installed. Buttonwood's refit was not completed until early 1993. The total cost of her renovation was budgeted at $13,023,000. In January 1993 USCGC Blackhaw sailed from her homeport of San Francisco to the Coast Guard Yard in Maryland where she was decommissioned. Her crew was detailed to Buttonwood. They sailed back to San Francisco, which became the ship's new home port. Her primary responsibility was maintaining aids to navigation, but she was also active in search and rescue, and oil spill response. Buttonwood's most newsworthy deployment during this posting was recovery or debris associated with the crash of an US Air Force HC-130 off the California coast in November 1996. She hauled wreckage onto her buoy deck for later analysis on shore. Buttonwood was decommissioned in San Francisco on June 28, 2001.. She received a number of awards during her government service including the Coast Guard Unit Commendation, Meritorious Unit Commendation, World War II Victory Medal, Navy Occupation Service Medal, and at least four battle efficiency awards.  Dominican Republic service  Alimirante Didiez Burgos (ex USCGC Buttonwood) in 2008 Almirante Didiez Burgos and USS Anzio during UNITAS Atlantic 2012 exercise Buttonwood was transferred to the Dominican Republic Navy on June 30, 2001 at a ceremony in San Francisco. She was renamed Almirante Didiez Burgos. She is the flagship of the Dominican Republic Navy. The ship is used for transport and supply missions, coastal patrol, smuggling and drug interdiction, and as a training vessel. She is stationed at the 27th of February Navy Base in Santo Domingo. Her complement is 12 officers and 45 enlisted men. She has been rearmed for her new role as a patrol vessel with two M-2 0.50 caliber machine guns and two single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The ship's namesake is Rear Admiral Ram√≥n Julio Didiez Burgos who was head of the Dominican Republic Navy at various times between 1947 and 1955. In 2010 Almirante Didiez Burgos took part in a joint United States Coast Guard-Dominican Republic training exercise in Dominican territorial waters. She sailed in the UNITAS Atlantic 2012 exercise with US and other navies. Almirante Didiez Burgos sailed to Baltimore to participate In Fleet Week celebrations in 2012. The ship delivered emergency supplies to the Bahamas in the wake of Hurricane Dorian in 2019.

During this time, she was helping Professor Deryugin to conduct practical classes with students. Soon she began a course of lectures on hydrobiology.  Work  In 1929, Gurjanova graduated from the graduate school and was transferred to work at the Zoological Institute. At the Zoological Institute Gurjanova studied two groups of crustaceans ‚Äì Isopoda and Amphipoda ‚Äì becoming one of world‚Äôs specialists in the field and writing capital monographies on this subject. In the 1930‚Äì1960s Gurjanova took part in many expeditions in the western part of the Pacific Ocean. She explored marine biology, working in the White and Bering seas, Kuril and Sakhalin islands areas, and the northwestern Pacific Ocean. From 1939 to 1952 Gurjanova was a member of the department of hydrobiology and ichthyology at Leningrad State University. After the death of Professor Deryugin, she took over responsibility for the department. Since 1946, Gurjanova was in charge of the Department of Higher Crustaceans at the Zoological Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.

It is endemic to Cameroon and is only known from Mount Oku where it occurs near Lake Oku. It has not been observed after 2010 and might already be extinct. The specific name njiomock means \\"eleventh\\" in Oku language and refers to the name \\"Phrynobatrachus sp. 11\\" that used in 1978 to refer to a specimen collected near Lake Oku. Common name Lake Oku puddle frog has been proposed for this species. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The body shape is compact and the hind limbs are strong. The tympanum is indistinct or only scarcely visible. Fingers lack webbing and have small but distinct discs. Toes are moderately to extensively webbed and have small discs. Dorsal coloration varies from greyish brown to dark brown. Coloration may appear uniform but typically includes some lighter and darker spots, often with reddish spots on head and limbs. Some individuals have a light brown mid-dorsal stripe. Males have light brown mottling on the throat. Habitat and conservation Phrynobatrachus njiomock occurs in or close to streams in montane forest at elevations of above sea level, as well as near the shores of Lake Oku at 2,219 m a.s.l. It is predominantly crepuscularly and nocturnally active. Breeding might take place in streams. Tadpoles commonly develop in the shallow waters of Lake Oku. Phrynobatrachus njiomock used to be the most abundant frog at Lake Oku (apart from the fully aquatic Xenopus longipes), but it has declined in recent years; as of 2019, it had not been observed since 2010 despite monthly monitoring in the area. The decline is similar to declines associated with chytridiomycosis, although the causal link remains unproven. Another threat is potential introduction of fish to Lake Oku. Although a large portion of the species' small range (14 km¬≤) is within Kilum-Ijim Plantlife Sanctuary, livestock grazing and agricultural expansion occurs within the area.

Director Ganesh Dev Panday filed a writ in the Supreme Court of Nepal in May 2016, citing freedom of expression. Nepali filmmakers Nischal Basnet, Khagendra Lamichhane, Sunil Pokhrel, Sunil Thapa, and Deepak Raj Giri protested the board's decision. Panday felt that the title spoke to \\"the soul of the movie\\", with gaja for 'marijuana' and baja for the film's music, and did not wish to alter it. The FDB was criticized for not clearly defining content guidelines for films, making its censorship decisions appear arbitrary, and for not developing a rating system for mature content. Panday and production house Tuka Entertainment won the two-year legal battle. In March 2018, the FDB approved the film's release under an adult certificate, with all of the \\"vernacular dialogues\\" to be muted. Moviemandu reported that the film trailer had been bleep censored.  Release and reception  The film was released domestically in theatres on 9 March 2018. A review in Online Khabar stated: \\"Overall the movie is entertaining\\" and praised the two lead actors and the bonding between their characters. It found the dark comedy to be engaging, particularly in the first half, but felt that the ending was too sudden. Timothy Aryal of The Kathmandu Post said Gaja Baja was one of four independent Nepali films released that year which broke from foreign formulaic narratives, describing it as \\"a trailblazer in its own right, for it brought a new genre‚Äîthe stoner comedy‚Äîto the Nepali film industry\\".

The OWA and its chapters also engage in provincial and municipal governance, both through advocacy on behalf of their membership and contributions to government publications. As of 2020 the OWA has 20 local chapters, primarily located in Southern Ontario but ranging from Algoma and North Bay in the north to Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry in the east, and Lake Erie in the south. While privately owned woodlots exist throughout the province, the vast majority of woodlands in the southern part of the province are privately owned, totalling over 4,000,000 ha. Forest management is of particular importance in Southern Ontario, because forests in this part of the province are part of the important Mixedwood Plains Ecozone, which covers only 1.3% of Canada's land area; the rest of the province is covered by the Boreal Shield. Land development, led by the growth of the Golden Horseshoe, has had a major negative impact on forests in Southern Ontario. History The OWA was founded in 1992 as the Ontario Woodlot and Sawmill Operators Association (OWSOA). At the time, the Ontario government was proposing changes to legislation including the Trees Act and wetland policy. The Managed Forest Tax Rebate Program (MFTRP) was also cancelled, which led to increased property taxes on private woodlots. Woodlot owners felt that these changes would diminish their ability to sustainably manage woodlots, leading to the formation of the OWSOA as a grassroots advocacy organization. In 1996, the province established the Managed Forest Tax Incentive Program due in part to OWSOA's lobbying. The organization adopted the name Ontario Woodlot Association around 1997. Projects The OWA publishes a quarterly newsletter, ‚ÄúThe Ontario Woodlander‚Äù (formerly the S & W Report) and a monthly eLetter to all members and supporters. The organization also offers workshops and courses on best practices in forest management. The OWA operates a Forest Services Directory and a Woodlot Marketplace as well as producing a number of publications. In addition to its activity in Ontario, the OWA is an active member of the Canadian Federation of Woodlot Owners. After the ice storm of 1998 left forests in Eastern Ontario devastated, the OWA worked on behalf of landowners to get assistance with cleanup and restoration. The OWA joined with several governmental and non-governmental stakeholders to form the Ice Storm Forest Recovery Group. The work of this group included the Forest Recovery Assistance Program, which provided financial assistance to approximately 1000 woodlot owners to assist with assessment and clean-up. The OWA was commissioned by Environment and Climate Change Canada to produce a report on firewood production in Southern Ontario. Firewood is an important source of fuel for heating, as approximately 7% of homes use firewood for heating, the third most prominent fuel source. The study also found that ash and beech are prominent sources of firewood due to the prevalence of emerald ash borer and Beech bark disease in provincial woodlots.

Its nearest neighbor is Cloudy Peak to the southwest, and the nearest higher neighbor is Bonanza Peak, to the northeast. North Star Mountain was originally named Bonanza Peak, and vice versa, but the USGS‚Äô first 1904 topographic map of the region mistakenly interchanged the names. Precipitation runoff from North Star drains into Agnes Creek and Railroad Creek, both tributaries of the Chelan River. Geology North Star Mountain is located in the Cloudy Pass batholith, an intrusive formation that was formed approximately , during the early Miocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008.CLOUDY PASS BATHOLITH AND ASSOCIATED ROCKS USGS The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is southwest of North Star Mountain, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. Glaciation was most prevalent approximately , and most valleys were ice-free by .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Subduction and tectonic activity in the area began during the late cretaceous period, about . Extensive volcanic activity began to take place in the oligocene, about . Climate North Star Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. This climate supports the Grant Glacier in a cirque on the north side of the mountain. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

Along with Baixo Islet to its south, Praia Islet is one of two main breeding places of Monteiro's storm petrel, an endemic marine bird of the Azores. Geography Praia Islet is a basaltic, palagonite islet formed by pyroclastic lava flows during the Graciosa Caldera's last eruption. It measures about , or , in area and approximately in perimeter. The islet's highest altitude is above sea level. The ocean is not very deep around the islet: its depth does not exceed within a radius around the islet. The ocean floor near Praia Islet consists of lava flows covered in boulders‚Äîmuch like the islet itself‚Äîwith some small sandy patches in the deeper zones. =Biome= Praia Islet boasts deep soil and is highly vegetated, in contrast to some of the smaller Azorean islets. It is home to endemic Azorean flowering plants including Azorean carrot (Daucus carota azoricus), Azorean heather (Erica azorica), bracel-da-rocha fescue grass (Festuca petraea), Carex vulcani, Spergularia azorica, Tolpis succulenta, and vid√°lia (Azorina vidalii). These plants had to be reintroduced to the islet in the late 19th century, after extirpation of invasive rabbits. The islet also serves as a marine bird sanctuary and breeding ground. Along with Baixo Islet to its south, Praia Islet is one of two main breeding places of Monteiro's storm petrel, an endemic marine bird of the Azores. Of the estimated 250 to 300 total breeding pairs of Monteiro's storm petrel, 71 nested on Praia Islet in 2009‚Äîup from 13 in 2001 when researchers first installed 151 artificial nests on the islet. Other seabirds breeding on the islet include band-rumped storm petrel, Barolo shearwater, Cory's shearwater, common tern, roseate tern, and sooty tern. Terrestrial birds sometimes alight on Praia Islet. Researchers have observed Madeiran wall lizard‚Äîan introduced species endemic to Madeira‚Äîon the islet, which is of particular concern because the lizards occasionally predate on Monteiro's storm petrel chicks. The waters around the islet are also biodiverse. They are home to barred hogfish (Bodianus scrofa), bluetail parrotfish (Sparisoma chrysopterum), bogue (Boops boops), and European spider crab (Maja squinado). Aquatic plants present in the area include the brown algae Cystoseira and Dictyota dichotoma, and the red algae Asparagopsis armata and Corallina officinalis. Because the islet hosts endemic birds and plants, it is a protected natural area with restricted human access. Since March 1990 the islet has been protected through the European Environment Agency's Natura 2000 initiative and recognized as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International. In 2008 the islet was protected locally as part of the Nature Park of Graciosa, one of the protected areas of the Azores. When ornithologists and other scientific researchers need to access Praia Islet, they do so easily by sea, as the islet has a small natural harbor.

After serving as an ordinary soldier in the final stages of the Russian Civil War, Kazanov became a political commissar during the 1920s but shifted over to command and staff positions from the mid-1920s. He rose to chief of staff the Central Asian Military District by the time Operation Barbarossa began, and 1942 and 1943 served as chief of staff and deputy commander of fronts, with a stint as commander of the 69th Army during the Third Battle of Kharkov. Kazakov commanded the 10th Guards Army from early 1944 as it advanced into the Baltic states and blockaded the Courland Pocket. Postwar, he rose to command of the Southern Group of Forces and the Leningrad Military District, ending his career as first deputy chief of the General Staff.  Early life and Russian Civil War  A Russian, Kazakov was born to a peasant family on 9 October 1901 in the village of Velikusha, Vologda Governorate. He completed primary school and after the October Revolution in 1917 became a member of the local revolutionary committee and a soldier in a food detachment. Conscripted into the Red Army in July 1920 during the Russian Civil War, Kazakov was sent to the 3rd Reserve Regiment in Arkhangelsk, and a month later became secretary to the regimental commissar. He fought on the Southern Front from August 1920 as a copyist in the office of the commissar of the 136th Brigade of the 46th Rifle Division, then as a Red Army man of the 407th Rifle Regiment. Kazakov participated in the battles against the Army of Wrangel in the Nikopol bridgehead, the Perekop‚ÄìChongar Operation in November and the elimination of anti-Soviet forces in Crimea in December.  Interwar period  After the end of the war, Kazakov served as a political commissar in the 46th and 3rd Crimean Rifle Divisions, serving as a company political commissar in the 21st Rifle Regiment from July 1921. In January 1922 he became assistant commissar of the regiment, then became commissar of the 19th Rifle Regiment in March. Kazakov subsequently became a party organizer in the 7th Regiment before transferring to the 2nd Red Cossack Cavalry Division in June 1924 to become commissar of its 8th Cavalry Regiment. With the division, he became an instructor and propagandist of the division political department before moving to a command role as assistant regimental commander for supply. Kazakov as a major general in 1940 Kazakov graduated from the Novocherkassk Cavalry Officers Improvement Course (KUKS) in 1927 and the Frunze Military Academy in 1931. This education prepared him to assume operational positions, and he became deputy chief of the administration and supply department of the Frunze Academy upon his graduation in May 1931. He transferred to the 2nd Cavalry Corps, stationed in the Kiev Military District, to serve as chief of the 1st section of its staff in June 1933, and became commander and commissar of the 29th Cavalry Regiment of the 5th Cavalry Division in March 1936. Promoted to colonel in the same year, Kazakov was sent to study at the General Staff Academy, being appointed deputy chief of staff of the Central Asian Military District upon his graduation in July 1937. Kazakov succeeded to the position of chief of staff of the district in April 1938, rising to the ranks of kombrig on 15 July of that year and komdiv on 31 December 1939. When the Red Army introduced general officer ranks on 4 June 1940, he became a major general.  World War II  Shortly after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, Kazakov became chief of staff of the 53rd Separate Army, formed from the Central Asian Military District for the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. While the army was stationed in Iran, he served as its acting commander in late October. After the army headquarters was disbanded, Kazakov's request to be sent to the front was granted and in January 1942 he became chief of staff of the Bryansk Front. Transferring to serve in the same position with the Voronezh Front on 20 July, Kazakov participated in the organization of training and planning for the Ostrogozhsk‚ÄìRossosh Offensive and the Voronezh‚ÄìKastornoye operation. Promoted to lieutenant general in January 1943, Kazakov commanded the 69th Army in February and March 1943. After the Third Battle of Kharkov, he became assistant commander of the forces of the Reserve Front, which ultimately became the Steppe Front, in April. In July he transferred to become deputy commander of the Bryansk Front, which became the Baltic Front on 10 October and then the 2nd Baltic Front ten days later. Kazakov was given command of the 10th Guards Army of the front on 20 January 1944 and led it for the rest of the war in the Riga Offensive and the blockade of the Courland Pocket. He was promoted to colonel general in September. For his \\"skillful leadership and personal courage\\" displayed in the war, Kazakov was made a Hero of the Soviet Union in February 1978.  Postwar  After the end of the war, Kazakov commanded the army until August 1946, and participated in the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945. Transferred to the Transcaucasian Military District, he became district deputy commander in August 1946 and its chief of staff in February 1947. Relieved from his post for \\"an incorrect attitude to the issues of national formations\\" in the district, Kazakov was appointed assistant commander of the forces of the South Ural Military District, effectively a demotion. This proved temporary as he was appointed chief of staff of the Odessa Military District in November 1950 and commander of the Ural Military District in May 1953. Promoted to army general in August 1955, Kazakov was appointed deputy commander-in-chief of the Ground Forces for combat training in January 1956. His rise to senior posts continued and he commanded the Southern Group of Forces in Hungary from December of that year and then the Leningrad Military District from October 1960. Kazakov was appointed chief of the Combined Staff of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and simultaneous first deputy chief of the General Staff in November 1965. This proved to be his last active post as in August 1968 he was effectively retired as an inspector-advisor of the Group of Inspectors General. Kazakov died in Moscow on 25 December 1979 and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

A feminist, her controversial 1925 autobiography, My First Thirty Years (published in Paris, France) received some favorable reviews but was also suppressed, and she soon after disappeared. Decades after her death, researchers found that when she returned to the United States in the late 1920s, she was committed to a state mental asylum in New York for the rest of her life. Life Edna Gertrude Beasley was born on June 20, 1892 near Cross Plains, Texas. Her father was an itinerant, subsistence farmer. She was the ninth child of a 13-child, poor family, and according to Beasely, her own birth was the product of marital rape. After her last sibling was born, her mother left the marriage, with the children, and moved to Abilene, Texas. Unlike the rest of her family, Beasley was interested in school and education. She became a teacher and obtained a teaching degree. She left Texas to pursue a masters in education at the University of Chicago, which was awarded to her in 1918. According to a later newspaper article, she also worked as a journalist in Chicago. By 1920, Beasely was in Tokyo, Japan where she wrote for The Far East. There, she also wrote for National Geographic. She then spent time working as a writer in China, and in Moscow, Russia. In Paris, France, Contact Editions published Beasely's autobiography, My First Thirty Years, in 1925. The book received some favorable notices, although according to literary reviewer, H. L. Mencken, \\"This book, I suspect, comes out with a Paris imprint because no American publisher would risk printing it\\", for its frank descriptions. Philosopher Bertrand Russel said the book was \\"truthful, which is illegal\\". Beasely was in London, where the authorities tried to deport her for her obscene book. Eventually in the late 1920s, she did sail for America, and en route she wrote a letter to the U.S. State Department about her mistreatment and claimed authorities in Britain and the U.S. were trying to silence her. Almost as soon as she arrived in New York, she was committed to the state mental asylum in Islip, where she died decades later in 1955. Rediscovery In 1989, Texas author, Larry McMurtry, along with reviving favorable interest in her book, ignited interest in what seemed like a mystery regarding what came of Beasley. Researchers, particularly, Alice W. Specht, were eventually able to put together what happened regarding her seeming disappearance, and the abrupt end to Beasley's writing career.

There are terrestrial ecosystems, which includes prairies, boreal forest, and tundra. Manitoba is also the home to a number of aquatic ecosystems, including wetlands, rivers, and lakes. There is also a wide variety of wildlife and plants that thrive in this particular region. However, human impact has become more apparent and the need to protect and conserve is becoming clear. The Province of Manitoba created a protection act in March 1990 called The Endangered Species Ecosystem Act. The Act protects animals, plants, and ecosystems by supporting and monitoring development at a provincial level. This includes monitoring the land use, protection areas, planning, environmental assessment, and natural resources harvesting policies by incorporating the biodiversity values in their decision making. In June 2003, the federal government created the Species at Risk Act (SARA). The Act is to prevent wildlife species in Canada from disappearing, provide recovery of wildlife species that are endangered or threatened as a result of human activity, and prevent future loss of species (Canada.ca, 2020). A key component of the success of SARA is the participation of other levels of government to contribute in enforcing and protecting wildlife. Consulting and having cooperation of aboriginal communities and all stakeholders that may be affected in the protection of wildlife is another component of the Act's success. There are a number of Manitoban species on the SARA list that are now protected at a federal level, which will help reinforce their safety. More information about what Manitoba is doing to help protect the environment apart from biodiversity can be found on their website. The website highlights a number of subcategories of concerns regarding the environment, including: * Invasive species * Air quality management * Climate change * Pollution prevention * Pesticide use * Management of protected areas * Protection of at-risk species * Biodiversity conservation * Management of invasive species * Ecological reserve programs * Storage and handling of hazardous products like petroleum  References  * Benitez-lopez, A., Alkemade, R., & Verweij, P.

The film stars Henry Roussel, and was based upon the short story of the same name by Andr√© de Lorde. De Lorde adapted the story from the stage play he wrote with Georges Montignac, which was first performed in 1912 at the Grand Guignol in Paris. The film was believed to be lost until a partially damaged copy was discovered in 2007, and it was subsequently re-released by French film restoration, publishing and production company Lobster Films. Though the tradition of \\"Chambers of Horror\\" in wax museums dates back to late 18th century, the film has been noted as among the first pieces of horror fiction to involve a wax museum, prefiguring 1924's Waxworks, 1933's Mystery of the Wax Museum, and 1953's House of Wax among others. Plot Following a discussion of the nature of fear at a raucous cabaret, a man named Pierre claims that the emotion is unknown to him (\\"sensation m'est inconnue\\"), and accepts a bet to will stay at a sinister location all night. His friend Jacques, who proposed the bet, chooses a wax museum as the \\"sinister location.\\" Pierre pays the employee or proprietor of the wax museum (described simply as \\"l'homme aux figures de cire,\\" literally \\"the man with wax figures\\") to allow him to stay in the museum overnight. The man is reluctant, but agrees on the condition that Pierre not damage anything. He shows Pierre in, and leaves him there. At first, Pierre is bored, but as he wanders the grim tableaux, he gradually becomes more anxious. Eventually, terrified, he tries to get out, but discovers he is locked in. Meanwhile, Jacques, having left the cabaret around two AM, sneaks into the wax museum through a back entrance. Pierre sees his shadow behind a paper screen, and, frantic with terror, wildly stabs him. The final intertitle reveals that when Pierre is discovered at dawn, he has lost his mind and \\"his dagger had added another figure to the wax museum\\" (\\"son poignard avait ajout√© au mus√©e de cire une figure de plus\\"). The film ends with a wild, knife-wielding Pierre standing over the body of Jacques while police survey the scene. Cast * Henry Roussel as Pierre de Lionne * Emile Tramont as Jacques (credited as \\"M. Tramont\\") * Henri Gouget as \\"L'Homme aux figures de cire\\" (credited as \\"M. Gouget\\") Production Director Maurice Tourneur, scenarist Andr√© de Lorde and actor Henry Roussel had worked together previously a year earlier, in the 1913 silent horror film Le syst√®me du docteur Goudron et du professeur Plume (The System of Doctor Goudron, released in the US as The Lunatics), which itself was based on Edgar Allan Poe's 1845 short story The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether and, like Figures de cire, was originally staged as a play at the Grand Guignol in Paris in 1903 (where it had starred Henri Gouget). Though Figures de cire had originally been written as a stageplay by de Lorde (who wrote hundreds of plays for the Grand Guignol), the film credits state that it is based on his short story (in French, \\"nouvelles\\"), which he adapted from his play and published in an eponymous collection in 1932 (the story was first published in English as ‚ÄúWaxworks‚Äù in the 1933 anthology Terrors: A Collection of Uneasy Tales, anonymously edited by Charles Birkin).

She advised the German government on the SARS and Influenza A virus subtype H2N2 outbreaks.  Early life and education  In 1996 Ammon completed her doctorate in medicine at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where she studied the quality of life for patients that have palliative therapy for metastatic liver disease.  Career  Ammon joined the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin in 1996. Between 2002 and 2005, she was Head of Department for Infectious Disease Epidemiology. At the Robert Koch Institute, Ammon was responsible for the German national outbreak surveillance system, coordinating their response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Influenza A virus subtype H2N2. As part of this effort, Ammon investigated in-flight transmission of SARS and found that it was uncommon; and only likely if infected people fly during symptomatic phases of their illness. In 2005, Ammon joined the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), where she was appointed Head of Surveillance. She was one of the first employees at the ECDC, and has since been described as \\"instrumental\\" in establishing the surveillance strategy. The ECDC looks to standardise infection control across the European Union, ensuring consistent practise took place in the surveillance networks of member states. In this capacity she was responsible for the formation of The European Surveillance System (TESSy), a uniform, long-term data acquisition system for the European Union. TESSy launched in April 2008. Ammon was responsible for evaluating the European Dedicated Surveillance Networks (DSN), which included the EURO TB and EURO HIV networks, eventually incorporating them into the framework of the ECDC. In 2011 she was made Deputy Director of the Resource Management and Coordination unit. A few years later, she led the European Scientific Conference on Applied Infectious Disease Epidemiology. As part of the conference, in the wake of the Western African Ebola virus epidemic, Ammon oversaw sessions on food-borne diseases, zoonotic viruses and globalisation. She succeeded Marc Sprenger as Acting Director of the ECDC on 1 May 2015. She was subsequently appointed Director on 22 March 2017 and took office on 16 June 2017. In 2017 the ECDC and WHO announced that whilst cases of tuberculosis were on the decline in Europe, Tuberculosis in relation to HIV was on the rise. During the COVID-19 pandemic Ammon was involved with the global response to coronavirus disease. On January 26, Ammon and the ECDC advised governments in the European Union to strengthen their healthcare capacity. Unfortunately, the ECDC had over-estimated the stocks of personal protective equipment and lab testing capacity in individual member states, resulting in considerable spread of coronavirus disease across Europe. She has since said that the extensive spread of coronavirus in Europe can be linked to the return of holidaymakers from skiing trips in early March. In early May, Ammon gave evidence before the European Parliament on public health, and said that the United Kingdom was behind other European member states in their response to coronavirus disease. In an interview with The Guardian on May 20 2020, Ammon emphasised that there was likely to be a second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections, ‚Äú...the question is when and how big,‚Äù. = Selected publications =   References  Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:German physicians Category:German women physicians Category:German women academics Category:Coronavirus researchers Category:Public health doctors Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni ","title":"Andrea Ammon"},{"id":"64027795","text":"Coucy-l√®s-Eppes station (French: Gare de Coucy-l√®s-Eppes) is a railway station located in the commune of Coucy-l√®s-Eppes, in the department of Aisne, northern France.

The battery was constructed in 1914 at Downing Point, then part of the Earl of Moray‚Äôs Donibristle Estate. The site is now situated within the new town of Dalgety Bay in Fife. Forth defence lines In the First World War three lines of defence were established on the Firth of Forth to protect Rosyth Naval Dockyard, then home to the Battle Cruiser Fleet. These lines of defence were known as the Outer, Middle and Inner Defence Lines. War Office chart showing the three Forth Defence Lines in WW1 The Outer Line ran from a gun battery at Kinghorn to a battery at Leith Docks, with fortified gun emplacements on the island of Inchkeith. The Middle Line ran from Braefoot Battery in the North to a battery on Cramond Island in the South, with fortified gun emplacements on the islands of Inchcolm and Inchmickery. The Inner Line was situated close to the Forth Bridge, with batteries at Downing Point on the North coast and Hound Point on the South coast of the firth. Additional batteries were located at Carlingnose Point, Dalmeny, and on the island of Inchgarvie. Each line of defence also had an associated anti- submarine boom. Battery specification A QF 4.7-inch gun at Fort Peninsula, Quebec, the type of gun initially mounted at Downing Point The Downing Point Battery incorporated two gun emplacements, each was initially equipped with a QF 4.7-inch Mk I ‚Äì IV naval gun, designed to engage enemy surface vessels threatening ships at anchor in the Firth of Forth and the naval facilities at Rosyth Dockyard. Each 4.7 inch gun could fire a shell weighing 20kg out to range of 11km. In June 1917 the two 4.7 inch guns were transferred to the battery on Inchcolm Island and replaced with two QF 12-pounder 18 cwt naval guns taken from the island. These 12-pounder guns could fire a 5kg shell out to a range of 8.5km. A thin promontory of rock runs to the East from gun emplacements, this promontory housed two Defence Electric Lights - powerful searchlights designed to illuminate targets for the guns at night. One DEL was of the kind where the light could be moved to follow a target; the other produced a fixed beam, illuminating an area of water on which the guns were already pre-ranged. QF 12-pdr 18 cwt guns mounted on the Battleship HMS Dreadnought, the same type installed at Downing Point in 1917 War Office plan (1916) showing the design of Blockhouse No.5 as installed at Downing Point Battery The battery was manned by men of the Forth Royal Garrison Artillery and Royal Engineers. Downing Point Battery site plan dated 1916 showing the ring of defensive blockhouses, wire fence and barbed wire entanglements. It was important to ensure that coast defence batteries were not put out of action by enemy troops landing and attacking them from the landward side. The Downing Point battery was surrounded by both a plain wire fence and a barbed wire entanglement that ran out onto the beach along the northern side. There were also four blockhouses within the perimeter. The battery was further defended by an outer perimeter of six blockhouses positioned between 250 and 400m from the battery. The blockhouses were built of wood with pitched wood and felt roofs, internally there was a stove and bunks for 10 men. The blockhouses were made bulletproof with the addition of a sandbag wall placed approximately one metre away from the wooden structure. History Authority to proceed with construction was given in September 1914 with a budget of ¬£450. To equip the battery two 4.7 inch guns were transferred from the Kinghorn Battery and mounted at Downing Point in October 1914. Later in the war the fleet anchorages moved East of the Forth Bridge and consequently the Outer and Middle Defence Lines were given priority and strengthened at the expense of the Inner Line. The 4.7 inch guns were transferred to the Inchcolm Battery in June 1917, with a pair of 12-pounder guns transferred from the island and installed at Downing Point. Current status Remains of the Western gun emplacement at Downing Point overlooking the River Forth Visitors today can still access the two concrete gun emplacements from the Downing Point Battery, which offer a commanding view over the River Forth. A range finder post is situated between the two gun emplacements but this is now partially collapsed. Part of an information board erected by the Community Woodlands Group in Bathing House Wood which provides some history of the Downing Point Battery and a site layout map The site can be accessed by the public via Bathing House Wood, on a trail that forms part of the Fife Coastal Path. The Dalgety Bay Community Woodlands Group maintain the surrounding woodland area and have erected an information board commemorating the battery site. Unfortunately the majority of Battery buildings such as the barracks, magazine, engine room and defensive blockhouses are no longer present at the site. The surrounding area was developed in to residential housing during the 1960s. However it is still possible to observe the exposed concrete bases of the magazine, generator house, and ablutions blocks to the north of the site.

She won the Canadian Barrel Racing Championship in her sport in back-to-back wins in 1990 and 1991, and repeated in 1999 and 2005. She was reigning champion of the Ponoka Stampede in 2005, 2006, and 2007. She trained Tia, the horse who was awarded the Most Heart designation of the Canadian Finals Rodeo in 1991 and 1992 and in a single year had five horses that she trained qualify for the Canadian Finals Rodeo. She was inducted into the Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame in 2017. Early life Rayel Call was born in 1964 in Redding, California, but moved with her family to 150 Mile House, British Columbia, Canada when she was ten years old. Around the same time, she began competing in barrel racing events. She graduated from Columneetza Senior Secondary School in Williams Lake, British Columbia in 1982. That year, she won all-around cowgirl at the National High School Finals Rodeo, held in Wyoming. Based upon her performance at the rodeo, she was offered a scholarship to attend Casper College in Casper, Wyoming. In June 1983, she won the Central Rocky Mountain Regional barrel racing trophy and the following month, took top honors in barrel racing at the Williams Lake Stampede. While she was in school, Call met Bruce Robinson, a member of the faculty of Casper College, at a rodeo event and they married in 1984. Her husband participated in calf roping events and first qualified for the Canadian Finals Rodeo in 1985, two years after his wife had first qualified. Career Shortly after their marriage the Robinsons began training horses and located to Sundre, Alberta, where they operated an 80 acre ranch. In the winter months, the couple competed and trained in Arizona, returning to Canada in mid-March. In 1990, Robinson won the Canadian Barrel Racing Championship and the following year, repeated as champion. In 1991, she qualified for the first time for the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas, having set the earnings record that year in the Canadian finals. Her earnings represented the first time a woman had broken the $30,000 barrier in a single season for the Canadian Pro tour. Her horse Tia won the \\"Horse with the Most Heart\\" award from the Canadian Finals Rodeo in 1991 and 1992, which is the award honoring the barrel racing horse with the fastest time. By the end of the 1990s, Robinson had moved to Alix, Alberta, when she repeated as Canadian Barrel Racing Champion in 1999, aboard her Quarter Horse Bud. In 2004, she won the Barrel Futurities of America World Championship mounted on Lady Perks, owned by Grant Little. She won her 4th Canadian barrel racing championship in 2005, astride the same horse and that year, won the first of her three consecutive annual championships at the Ponoka Stampede. In 2007, she won her 19th trip to the Canadian Finals Rodeo, a qualifying record among barrel racers. Robinson married Grant Little after 2010, and the couple resided in Thorsby, Alberta, for half the year and in Maricopa, Arizona, for the rest of the year. Little continued to train horses and compete, but devoted most of her time in barrel racing to futurities rather than professional racing. In 2017, Little was inducted into the Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame. Among her many accomplishments, it was noted that she had trained five horses who all qualified for the Canadian Finals Rodeo \\"in a single year\\".

Early career The 'Macarte Lion' in 1874 - The Illustrated London News Thomas Macarte was born in Cork in Ireland in about 1839. He was married but had no children. There are claims that he was a member of the famous Macarte family of circus and music hall entertainers that included the equestrienne Marie Macarte and the high-wire act Macarte Sisters, but this cannot be verified. He had worked in menageries for much of his adult life including with the circus of Messrs. Bell and Myers and the American Hippodrome Circus before joining Manders‚Äô Menagerie as Massarti the Lion-Tamer after the death of the famous lion tamer Maccomo in January 1871. On 20 November 1862 Macarte was working with lions as an assistant to Alfred Moffat of the American Hippodrome Circus. While the circus was performing in Liverpool Macarte was walking past the lion cage when a lioness seized him by the left forearm, causing such severe damage it had to be amputated.London Daily News, \\"The Horrible Death at Menagerie,\\" January 6, 1872, p. 6 Perhaps as a result of this attack, Macarte did not always feel comfortable working with big cats and on occasion was known to imbibe hard spirits before a performance for a little \\"Dutch courage\\". Mander's Menagerie As Maccomo's successor at Mander's Menagerie Macarte's act was expected to be as thrilling as his predecessor's. Being new to Mander's he was not permitted to work with the tigers but immediately commenced working with the lions. However, despite his undoubted expertise Macarte was nervous around big cats and in addition had a habit of turning his back on them in the ring, leading to his being described as a \\"very bold and adventurous man [who] had been frequently cautioned respecting his rashness\\". Despite having been warned of the dangers this practice risked he continued to do so in his act which may have contributed to his death during his final performance. His wife later testified at the inquest that on the day of his death he had left her at about 2 p.m. and had not come back for his tea. One of the lions in his act had bitten Macarte earlier in the week and he confided to his wife that he was afraid of the animal. After his death this lion would become known as 'Macarte's Lion'. His wife related to the coroner that at the time he had left her that afternoon he had been sober, but it was alleged by others that he may have had a few drinks before the evening's performance so that by the time he entered the ring in his Roman gladiator costume he was unsteady.Massarti The Lion-Tamer - The Social Historian websiteHelen Cowie, Exhibiting Animals in Nineteenth-Century Britain: Empathy, Education, Entertainment, Palgrave Macmillan (2014) - Google Books] Death in the ring 'Terrible Scene in Manders' Menagerie - A Lion Tamer Killed' - The Illustrated Police News (1872) On the evening of 3 January 1872 Macarte was due to perform before a crowd of about 500 people for Manders‚Äô Menagerie in the marketplace at Bolton in Lancashire. After giving his usual talk about the big cats to the audience Macarte stepped into the cage, where he was attacked by the lions, which he attempted to fight them off with his sword and a pistol loaded with blanks but they overcame him.DEATH 'OF MASSARTI, THE LION TAMER'.

Other members of the show eventually forced the animals back into an inner cage but they dragged Macarte with them. Eventually rescued after a quarter of an hour of being mauled, he said \\"I am done for\\". He died on the way to the hospital.

Karlstrom et al. informally raised the Uncompahgre Formation to group rank in 2017, assigning the Vallecito Conglomerate as a member.Karlstrom et al. 2017  Geology  The Uncompahgre Formation is a sequence of quartzite and black phyllite some in thickness. It is exposed in a curving belt from the northwestern to northeastern Needle Mountains with outliers near Ouray and Rico, Colorado. It is interpreted as metamorphosed marine and fluvial sandstone, mudstone, and shale. The formation overlies plutons with an age of 1707 Ma and detrital zircon geochronology confirms a maximum age of 1709 Ma. Ar40Ar/39Ar dating of muscovite in an intruding dike gives a minimum age of 1704 Ma, allowing the age of the Uncompahgre Formation to be tightly constrained. Dating of contact metamorphism aureoles show the formation was deformed by metamorphosis at around 1460 to 1400 Ma, concurrent with the Picuris orogeny.

After completing the Novocherkassk Cavalry Improvement Courses for Commanders (KUKS) in 1931, Khetagurov returned to the Transbaikal to command a battalion of the 2nd Priamur Artillery Regiment of the 2nd Priamur Rifle Division of the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army from December 1931, and in October 1932 became chief of artillery of the 1st Rifle Regiment of the army. After serving in the same position with the 4th Volochayevka Rifle Regiment, Khetagurov became chief of artillery of the De-Kastri Fortified Region in November 1933 before returning his previous post with the 4th Regiment in March 1934. He commanded the 3rd Separate Field Artillery Battalion from August 1935 and the 181st Artillery Regiment of the RGK from August 1937. By now a colonel, Khetagurov was sent to study at the Higher Education Courses for Higher Commanders at the F. E. Dzerzhinsky Artillery Academy in February 1938. He did not complete the course, as he was dropped from them in August to be appointed chief of artillery of the 20th Rifle Corps of the 2nd Red Banner Army, back in the Soviet Far East. This proved brief and in October Khetagurov returned to his command of the 181st Artillery Regiment, which became part of the 2nd Red Banner Army. He was sent west to the 1st Moscow Proletarian Motor Rifle Division to serve as its chief of artillery in August 1939. While with the division, he completed two classes of the night school department of the Frunze Military Academy in the same year. From March 1941 Khetagurov served as chief of artillery of the 21st Mechanized Corps of the Leningrad Military District.  World War II  After Operation Barbarossa began, Khetagurov and his unit fought in the border battles on the Northwestern Front from 23 June, defending in the area of Daugavpils and in the sector of Pskov. During these actions, he was wounded. From November he served as chief of staff of the 30th Army of the Kalinin Front in the Battle of Moscow. Khetagurov transferred to hold the same position with the new 3rd Guards Army of the Southwestern Front in the Battle of Stalingrad. He commanded the army between 14 March and 22 August 1943, a period in which it conducted an active defense on the line of the Seversky Donets in the area of Lysychansk. Khetagurov resumed his post as chief of staff for the recapture of Left-bank Ukraine later that year. He was transferred to serve as chief of staff of the 1st Guards Army in January 1944, participating in the Zhitomir‚ÄìBerdichev Offensive and the Proskurov‚ÄìChernovitsy Offensive. Khetagurov commanded the 82nd Guards Rifle Division from May 1944. As part of the 29th Guards Rifle Corps of the 8th Guards Army of the 3rd Ukrainian Front, his division fought in the fierce fighting to expand the Butor bridgehead on the western bank of the Dniester. In June the 82nd Guards and the army were withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and relocated to the 1st Belorussian Front for Operation Bagration and the Lublin‚ÄìBrest Offensive. In the latter, Khetagurov led the division in the fighting for the Magnuszew bridgehead, after which it defended its positions in the bridgehead. Khetagurov led his division in the attack out of the bridgehead during the January 1945 Warsaw‚ÄìPoznan Offensive, in which it broke through German defenses and captured ≈Å√≥d≈∫ on 19 January. The division reached Pozna≈Ñ on 23 January and within a month captured the city in street fighting. For his \\"skillful leadership\\" of the division and \\"courageous actions,\\" Khetagurov received the title Hero of the Soviet Union and was awarded the Order of Lenin on 6 April. In late March, the division fought in the fighting for Kustrin, then in the Berlin Offensive. Taking command of the 29th Guards Rifle Corps on 26 April, Khetagurov led it in the Berlin Offensive, during which it advanced to the Reichstag. Army commander Colonel General Vasily Chuikov recommended him for another award of the title Hero of the Soviet Union, but this was downgraded to the Order of Suvorov, 1st class. After the end of the war in Europe, Khetagurov was sent to the Far East in July to command the 59th Rifle Corps of the 1st Red Banner Army in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. He led the corps in the Battle of Mutanchiang and the subsequent capture of Harbin.  Postwar  After the end of the war, Khetagurov returned to his previous command, now with the Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany, in February 1946. After completing Higher Academic Courses at Voroshilov Higher Military Academy in April 1949, he was appointed commander of the 30th Guards Rifle Corps of the Leningrad Military District. In August 1952 he returned to Germany to serve as assistant commander of the 8th Guards Army, rising to command of the army in September 1954. Khetagurov advanced further to command the Northern Group of Forces in April 1958 and the Baltic Military District in March 1963, being promoted to army general in 1968. He remained in this post until assuming the sinecure post of inspector-advisor in the Group of Inspectors General in June 1971, which he held until his death in Moscow on 3 September 1975.

The mountain is situated on the crest of the Cascade Range, on the shared border of Snohomish County and Chelan County, also straddling the boundary between the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and the Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is Napeequa Peak, to the south. The peak is set on Chiwawa Ridge with Napeequa, and other notable peaks on this ridge include Fortress Mountain, Buck Mountain, Brahma Peak, Mount Berge, and Chiwawa Mountain. Topographic relief is significant since the western aspect of the mountain rises 4,000 feet above the Suiattle Valley in approximately . This mountain has small, unnamed, hanging glaciers in cirques surrounding the summit. Precipitation runoff from the peak and meltwater from the glaciers drains east to the headwaters of Napeequa River; or west into the Suiattle River. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. Glaciation was most prevalent approximately , and most valleys were ice-free by .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Left to right: Napeequa Peak, Cirque Mountain, and Peak 7529 seen from High Pass Subduction and tectonic activity in the area began during the late cretaceous period, about . Extensive volcanic activity began to take place in the oligocene, about 35 million years ago. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is west of Cirque Mountain, began forming in the mid-Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to Glacier Peak's proximity to Cirque Mountain, volcanic ash is common in the area. Climate Cirque Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

It was established by the Washington State Legislature in 1947, replacing an earlier system. The department has been led by commissioner Suzan G. LeVine, who was formerly U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein, since 2018. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the state unemployment system was the target of an international fraud scheme from Nigeria that cost over $650 million in losses. The system had processed claims for 30.8 percent of civilian workers in Washington, the highest of any state in the United States. The fraud ring, named \\"Scattered Canary\\" by security researchers, had also filed fraudulent unemployment claims in six other states and is under investigation from the U.S. Department of Justice. By early June, the state government had recovered $333 million out of the $650 million lost to the fraud scheme. The ESD had also implemented stricter reviews for unemployment claims that were later rolled back. In August, the ESD announced that benefits for 86,449 fraudulent accounts totaling $576 million had been paid out, of which $340 million had been recovered. The ESD's trust fund originally held $4.7 billion in March 2020, but was reduced to $2.8 billion within three months and is expected to be depleted by 2021.

The islands are mountainous, and Mount Binaiya (3,027 meters) on Seram is the highest point. The islands that make up the ecoregion are part of Wallacea, a group of islands that are part of the Australasian realm, but were never joined to either the Australian or Asian continents. The islands of Wallacea are home to a mix of plants and animals from both terrestrial realms, and have many unique species that evolved in isolation.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J.

The Seram Sea bounds the ecoregion on the north and east, and the Banda Sea lies to the south. Lydekker's Line runs through the Seram Sea; the line demarcates the islands of Wallacea from the islands on the Australia-New Guinea continental shelf which were joined together during the ice ages when sea levels were lower. Climate The ecoregion has a tropical rain forest climate.

He was appointed the pope's representative to a group of missionary countries but died just as he was taking up that assignment. Biography Arthur Hughes was born on 25 August 1902 in the Clapton neighborhood of London, to parents who had immigrated from Ireland and Wales. He was raised without religion and chose to be a Catholic after leaving school at age 14 and studying independently. He was sent to study at the minor seminary of the Missionaries of Africa in Bishop's Waltham and then in Carthage. He was ordained a priest of that order on 28 June 1927. He taught briefly in Bishop's Waltham and then led a parish in West London while preaching throughout the United Kingdom. His first missionary posting was in Uganda where he worked in education from 1933 to 1942. Then he arrived in British-occupied Egypt as a welcome alternative to the apostolic delegate there who was Italian, but he maintained his independence from his countrymen. He functioned as papal representative though he lacked the title. He attended to prisoners of war and occupying troops evenhandedly. And he focused on establishing cordial relations with the various Christian and non-Christian communities. On 3 March 1945, Pope Pius XII appointed him titular archbishop of Hieropolis and Apostolic Delegate to Egypt. Egypt then worked toward establishing full diplomatic relations with the Holy See, the first Muslim state to do so. On 23 August 1947, Pope Pius XII appointed him titular archbishop of Aprus and Apostolic Internuncio to Egypt. He died on a visit to his family in England on 12 July 1949 at the age of 46.

He was a member of the House of Assembly of Zimbabwe for Mbare East from 1990 to 2000 and served as deputy minister of local government, rural and urban development from 1995 until 2000. Before entering Parliament, he was a member of the Harare City Council and served as mayor of Harare from 1985 to 1986. Born in Gatooma, Gara worked as an accountant for companies in Southern Rhodesia and Malawi. He returned to Rhodesia in 1975 to become chief executive officer of Negondo Industries, a chemical and cosmetics manufacturing company. Having joined the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) in Malawi, he held a series of leadership positions within the party in Rhodesia and later Zimbabwe, eventually serving as the ZANU‚ÄìPF chairman for Harare Province. In 1979, Gara was elected to the city council in Salisbury (renamed Harare in 1982), becoming its first black member. He served as deputy mayor from 1984 to 1985, and was then elected mayor, serving for one year. In 1990, he was elected to Parliament and made news for a controversial statement he made comparing President Robert Mugabe to Jesus Christ. He was reelected in 1995 and named deputy minister of local government and national housing in Mugabe's cabinet, but lost reelection in 2000 to the candidate of the newly-formed Movement for Democratic Change. He died of cancer six years later.  Early life and education  Gara was born on 17 April 1939 in Gatooma, Southern Rhodesia. He was raised in rural Zvimba District. He attended the Mashonganyika, Mbizi, and Tsungai primary schools between 1950 and 1957. He attended Moleli High School in Chegutu District, and later completed his Advanced Levels via correspondence. He went on to earn a diploma in accountancy.  Career  Business career = In 1963, Gara began working as an assistant accountant for Goodwood Hotels, before going to Malawi to work as an accountant for Blantyre Hotels in 1966. In 1972, he began working at the Rennies Group as a divisional accountant. In 1975, he left Malawi and returned to Rhodesia, where he joined Blue Moon Investments as group accountant. In 1980, he was named chief executive officer of Negondo Industries, a chemical and cosmetics manufacturing company, a position he held until 1995. After leaving parliament, Gara ran his own chemicals company and also owned a chain of hair salons. = Political career = Gara joined the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) upon its formation in Malawi. From 1980 to 1982, he was chairman of the party's Harare Central district. Between 1982 and 1984, he served as chairman of the Mount Pleasant district and as the party's deputy secretary for administration for Harare Province. He was appointed ZANU‚ÄìPF secretary for administration for Harare Province in 1987. He became a member of the party's central committee in 1994. In 1998, he was elected ZANU‚ÄìPF provincial chair for Harare Province, defeating former ZAPU member Rodrick Nyandoro. His deputy chairman, Oliver Chidawu, was a fellow former Harare mayor. Gara became the first black member of the Harare City Council (then Salisbury) in 1979 when he was elected to a seat representing Greendale. He later became the city's first black alderman, an honorary title awarded to councillors who have served ten years or more. He served as deputy mayor from 1984 to 1985. He was elected mayor of Harare on 29 July 1985, with Solomon Tawengwa as his deputy. In the April 1990 election, Gara was elected to Parliament for the Mbare East constituency. He received 12,522 votes out of 17,880 cast, easily defeating Zimbabwe Unity Movement candidate Biston David, who came in second with 4,420 votes. That year, he made news for a controversial statement he made comparing President Robert Mugabe to Jesus. In his first speech before Parliament, he said, \\"This country and its people should thank the Almighty for giving us His only other son, by the name of Robert Gabriel Mugabe.\\" Gara's statement was criticized by churches and individuals within Zimbabwe, with letters to local newspapers accusing him of blasphemy and sycophancy. The Catholic magazine Moto argued that Zimbabwe did not need a cult of personality like that of Kim Il-sung in North Korea. Gara later denied making the comparison and said his words were taken out of context, asking, \\"How can I liken Mugabe to Jesus? There is only one Jesus and he can't be matched by anybody.\\" Gara was reelected to Parliament in 1995 with 15,762 votes (86%), defeating Patricia Mpange of ZANU‚ÄìNdonga, who received 2,510 votes. After the election, he was named to the new cabinet as deputy minister of local government, rural and urban development, an office he held for five years. He lost his bid for reelection in 2000 by a significant margin, receiving 4,265 votes against 10,754 votes cast for Tichaona Munyanyi, the candidate of the newly-formed Movement for Democratic Change opposition party. On 4 January 2002, Gara's name was included on a government list published in The Herald of around 100,000 black Zimbabweans selected to receive land seized from white farmers. Gara was listed as having been allocated a commercial farm seized from a white farmer in Mashonaland West, the country's richest agricultural province. In 2004, Gara sought to rejoin the ZANU‚ÄìPF Central Committee, but lost to Edward Chataika. In 2005, he attempted to run for Parliament in the Mbare constituency, but lost the primary election to Tendai Savanhu. In May 2005, Gara was named to a five- person monitoring committee created by local government minister Ignatius Chombo to wrest authority over Harare from the capital's MDC-dominated city council. In July 2005, Gara and colleague Shepherd Chironga filed a Z$110 million defamation lawsuit against Namion Modern Chirwa, chairman of ZANU‚ÄìPF's Joshua Nkomo District in Mbare. Gara and Chironga claimed that Chirwa had accused them of being homosexuals in front of a church congregation. Chirwa denied making the statement in question and said the issue was political. He claimed that Gara was bitter after the party's Harare Province passed a vote of no confidence in him earlier that year for his alleged attempts to set up a rival party district in Mbare.  Later life and death  Gara died on 14 November 2006 around 6 a.m. at St Anne's Hospital in Harare. He had been suffering from cancer for almost six years, and had recently been in and out of the hospital. He was survived by his wife, seven children, and six grandchildren. Mourners gathered at his home in the Mount Pleasant suburb of Harare, and he was buried two days later on 16 November. President Robert Mugabe, who was Gara's cousin, spoke at his funeral.

The ecoregion includes the lowlands of Sulawesi and neighboring islands. Geography Sulawesi is the largest island in the ecoregion, with an area of 180,681 km¬≤. Sulawesi is the fourth-largest island in Indonesia, and the eleventh-largest in the world. The ecoregion includes many neighboring islands, including the Banggai and Sula Islands to the east, the Sangihe Islands and Talaud Islands to the north, the islands of Buton and Muna to the southeast, and the Selayar Islands to the south. Sulawesi and the other islands are mountainous. The islands that make up the ecoregion are part of Wallacea, a group of islands that are part of the Australasian realm, but were never joined to either the Australian or Asian continents. The islands of Wallacea are home to a mix of plants and animals from both terrestrial realms, and have many unique species that evolved in isolation.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. The Makassar Strait separates Sulawesi from Borneo to the west. The strait is part of the Wallace Line, which demarcates the western boundary of Wallacea. Borneo and other Indonesian islands west of Sulawesi are part of Sundaland, and were connected to the Asian continent when sea levels were lower during the ice ages. The mountains of Sulawesi above 1000 meters elevation are part of the separate Sulawesi montane rain forests ecoregion. Climate The ecoregion has a tropical wet or rain forest climate. Flora The main plant communities are tropical lowland evergreen rain forest, and semi-evergreen rain forest, seasonally-dry monsoon forests at the tip of the southeast peninsula, and areas of freshwater swamp forest and peat swamp forest.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. Fauna The ecoregion is home to 104 mammal species, of which 29 are endemic or near-endemic to the ecoregion.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. Larger mammals include three pigs, the Celebes warty pig (Sus celebensis) the North Sulawesi babirusa (Babyrousa celebensis), and Togian babirusa (Babyrousa togeanensis). The Celebes warty pig lives in the lower lowland and lower montane rain forests of Sulawesi and other islands of Wallacea. The North Sulawesi babirusa lives in both the lowland and montane rain forests of northern and central Sulawesi. The Togian babirusa lives only on the Togian Islands, which lie in the Gulf of Tomini between Sulawesi's northern and eastern peninsulas. The endemic lowland anoa (Bubalus depressicornis) is a dwarf buffalo which stands only 90 cm (35 in) high. The Celebes rusa deer (Rusa timorensis macassaricus) is a subspecies of the Javan rusa, which may have been introduced from Sundaland to Sulawesi by humans in ancient times. There are two endemic marsupials in the ecoregion, the Banggai cuscus (Strigocuscus pelengensis) which is endemic to the Banggai and Sula islands, and the Sulawesi bear cuscus (Ailurops ursinus), which lives in the lowlands of Sulawesi, Muna, Buton, and the Banggai and Togian islands. There are three endemic macaque species on Sulawesi. The Celebes crested macaque (Macaca nigra) lives in both the lowland and montane forests. The Moor macaque (Macaca maura) is endemic to the south peninsula. The Booted macaque (Macaca ochreata) is endemic to the southeast peninsula, Muna, and Buton. Sulawesi's tarsiers include many endemics ‚Äì the Makassar tarsier (Tarsius fuscus) from southwestern Sulawesi, Gursky‚Äôs spectral tarsier (Tarsius spectrumgurskyae) and Jatna's tarsier (Tarsius supriatnai) from the northern peninsula, spectral tarsier (Tarsius spectrum) from Selayar, and Peleng tarsier (Tarsius pelengensis) of Peleng Island in the Banggai Islands. There are two endemic bats, Acerodon humilis and Neopteryx frosti, and eleven endemic species of Murid rodents: Rattus koopmani, Rattus bontanus, Rattus elaphinus, Maxomys hellwaldii, Haeromys minahassae, Margaretamys beccarii, Taeromys celebensis, Taeromys punicans, Taeromys taerae, Echiothrix leucura, and Melomys caurinus. Eight other mammals are Sulawesi endemics, and live in both the lowland and montane forest ecoregions: the Sulawesi palm civet (Macrogalidia musschenbroekii), Elongated shrew (Crocidura elongata), Sulawesi shrew (Crocidura lea), Sulawesi tiny shrew (Crocidura levicula), Crested roundleaf bat (Hipposideros inexpectatus), Minahassa pipistrelle (Pipistrellus minahassae), Gaskell's false serotine (Hesperoptenus gaskelli), and Yellow- tailed rat (Rattus xanthurus).

It was written by Marcus Schaefer, a professor of computer science at DePaul University, and published in 2018 by the CRC Press in their book series Discrete Mathematics and its Applications. Topics The main text of the book has two parts, on the crossing number as traditionally defined and on variations of the crossing number, followed by two appendices providing background material on topological graph theory and computational complexity theory. After introducing the problem, the first chapter studies the crossing numbers of complete graphs (including Hill's conjectured formula for these numbers) and complete bipartite graphs (Tur√°n's brick factory problem and the Zarankiewicz crossing number conjecture), again giving a conjectured formula). It also includes the crossing number inequality, and the Hanani‚ÄìTutte theorem on the parity of crossings. The second chapter concerns other special classes of graphs including graph products (especially products of cycle graphs) and hypercube graphs. After a third chapter relating the crossing number to graph parameters including skewness, bisection width, thickness, and (via the Albertson conjecture) the chromatic number, the final chapter of part I concerns the computational complexity of finding minimum-crossing graph drawings, including the results that the problem is both NP-complete and fixed-parameter tractable. In the second part of the book, two chapters concern the rectilinear crossing number, describing graph drawings in which the edges must be represented as straight line segments rather than arbitrary curves, and F√°ry's theorem that every planar graph can be drawn without crossings in this way. Another chapter concerns 1-planar graphs and the associated local crossing number, the smallest number such that the graph can be drawn with at most crossings per edge. Two chapters concern book embeddings and string graphs, and two more chapters concern variations of the crossing number that count crossings in different ways, for instance by the number of pairs of edges that cross or that cross an odd number of times. The final chapter of part II concerns thrackles and the problem of finding drawings with a maximum number of crossings. Audience and reception The book can be used as an advanced textbook, and has exercises provided for that use. However, it assumes that its readers are already familiar with both graph theory and the design and analysis of algorithms. Reviewing the book, L. W. Beineke calls it a \\"valuable contribution\\" for its presentation of the many results in this area.

The ICRC describes its primary purpose as being to advance the humanitarian and political protection of persecuted Assyrian Christians who live in post-war Iraq, whose population has dwindled from 1,500,000 in 2003 to about 150,000 just 17 years later in 2020 due to ongoing persecution and instability in their homeland. History and activitiesFounding and early history= The Iraqi Christian Relief Council was founded in 2007 by Juliana Taimoorazy. Taimoorazy started the organization in response to ongoing Assyrian persecution in their homeland of Iraq. According to Taimoorazy, the ICRC did not initially receive very much attention from American officials until the 2014 ISIS invasion of the Assyrian homeland. Since then, it has raised awareness through political advocacy, humanitarian support, and hosting public events, such as candlelight vigils. =Humanitarian activities= The ICRC predominantly provides humanitarian aid to Assyrians in Iraq. The majority of the aid goes through the Assyrian Aid Society and Dominican Sisters of Saint Catherine of Siena in Northern Iraq. The ICRC also provides humanitarian assistance to Assyrian refugees from Iraq in other countries in the Middle East, including Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. In the year 2016, the ICRC provided humanitarian aid to 95,000 Assyrian Christians in Iraq. The ICRC launched Operation Return to Nineveh in 2016. The project has allowed for the rebuilding of community centers, schools, homes, and churches destroyed by ISIS in predominantly Assyrian-Christian areas of Iraq. It has also further encouraged the establishment of Nineveh Plain Province to act as a safe haven for Assyrians in Iraq. =Assyrian Political advocacy= Taimoorazy has also met with Iraqi parliamentarians on behalf of ICRC to discuss the creation of a Christian province in Iraq. In August 2019, the ICRC and 15 other Assyrian organizations released a coalition letter thanking Representative Josh Harder for the creation of House Resolution 537, which would have the United States officially recognize the Assyrian genocide if passed. On behalf of the ICRC's leadership, Taimoorazy criticized the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) independence referendum for its potential negative impact on the Assyrian population of the region, and criticized the threats of violence issued by the KRG against Assyrians who protested the referendum. The ICRC released an official statement in 2020 condemning the refusal of the government of Turkey to investigate the disappearance of Assyrian couple Hurmiz and Shimoni Diril. =COVID-19 response= In 2020, the ICRC started the Save Those Who Save Lives Campaign. The campaign pledged $5,000 on behalf of ICRC to provide masks to healthcare workers in the United States as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ICRC also joined 27 other Non-governmental organizations and signed a letter calling on Iraqi authorities and the United Nations to implement measures aimed at preventing a humanitarian and security catastrophe in Sinjar, Tel Afar, and the Nineveh Plain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

India of South Asia was historically one of the top sellers in art in Southeast Asia, although there had been indigenous art in the region that predated Indian influence. The art is inspired by many different countries around the world.  Inspiration  Art culture in Southeast Asia is usually inherited from the art produced in China of East Asia and India of South Asia. Some of the art culture was changed after being invaded by other colonies such Dutch East Indies in Indonesia.  Countries  Brunei = Art in Brunei was not a focus until the early 1950s, Brunei's government then took a stand to support culture. They created a building for artists to sell their works. In 1984, the art market had grown enough that it had to move to a larger space. Weaving skills have been passed across generations. Brunei produces fabric for making gowns and sarongs. \\"The weaving and decoration of cloth as well as wearing, display, and exchange of it, has been an important part of Bruneian culture for years (Orr 96).\\" Weaving became significant in the 15th century. Antonio Pigafetta visited Brunei during his travels and observed how the clothes were made. One example was a Jongsarat, a handmade garment used for weddings and special occasions. It typically includes a hint of silver and gold. It can be used for wall coverings. = Cambodia = The history of Cambodian art stretches back centuries to ancient times, but the most famous period is undoubtedly the Khmer art of the Khmer Empire (802‚Äì1431), especially in the area around Angkor and the mainly 12th- century temple-complex of Angkor Wat, initially Hindu and subsequently Buddhist. Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the Khmer Rouge. = East Timor = Art in East Timor began to popularize since the violence during the 2006 East Timorese crisis. Children living in the country began graffiting walls into peace murals. The East Timor Arts Society promotes the art in the area, and house many different artworks produced in the country. = Indonesia = Indonesia has 300 ethnic culture groups, which heavily influences art in the country. Many forms of art in Indonesia are based on religion, sometimes Hinduism or Buddhism. = Laos = Art in Laos has slowly been changed recently after the country has been exposed to other countries around the world, which influenced many other artists. The Laotians have many forms of art, which they always experiment with. The Ho Phakeo temple (built in the 16th century by King Setthatirath) is a popular museum that houses many famous artworks that have been created in the country. Unfortunately, all films and music in Laos are required to be sent to government studios for official censorship (except for foreign films and music). = Malaysia = Traditional Malaysian art is mainly centred on the crafts of carving, weaving, and silversmithing. Traditional art ranges from handwoven baskets from rural areas to the silverwork of the Malay courts. Common artworks included ornamental kris and beetle nut sets. Luxurious textiles known as Songket are made, as well as traditional patterned batik fabrics. Indigenous East Malaysians are known for their wooden masks. Malaysian art has expanded only recently, as before the 1950s Islamic taboos about drawing people and animals were strong. Textiles such as the batik, songket, Pua Kumbu, and tekat are used for decorations, often embroidered with a painting or pattern. Traditional jewelry was made from gold and silver adorned with gems, and, in East Malaysia, leather and beads were used to the same effect. = Philippines = Art has developed and accumulated in the Philippines from the beginning of civilization in the country up to the present era. There are many branches of the art in the Philippines including folk architecture, weaving, literature, pottery, music, and many other art forms. = Singapore = Art in Singapore is almost entirely based on the art produced in Nanyang, China. The earliest form of Nanyang art were of the Bali paintings rendered by Chinese artists. = Thailand = Many of the art in Thailand is based on Buddhism. The first period of art occurred during the Sukhothai Kingdom, which began in the 13th century. The art during the period was mostly artworks drawn of Buddha. = Vietnam = Art in Vietnam was first introduced as clay pots created during the Stone Age. It is estimated that Vietnamese art began when indigenous groups began creating pottery. The art has been forged many times in the past. Some of the art at the Fine Arts Museum in Ho Chi Minh City had actually been forged.

The regiment was formed on November 7, 1862 when the 1st Missouri Infantry and the 4th Missouri Infantry were consolidated as a result of heavy battle losses in both units. The regiment served in several battles in the 1863 Vicksburg campaign, including a charge that almost broke the Union line at the Battle of Champion Hill. When the Siege of Vicksburg ended with a Confederate surrender, the regiment was captured and later exchanged. In 1864, the regiment fought in the Atlanta campaign, and suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Franklin. On April 9, 1865, the regiment surrendered at the Battle of Fort Blakely, and was paroled in May when the war ended for all effective purposes. Organization On November 7, 1862, the 1st Missouri Infantry and the 4th Missouri Infantry were combined into a single unit. The consolidation occurred because both units had suffered heavy losses. Because Archibald MacFarlane, the colonel of the 4th Missouri, had been severely wounded at the Second Battle of Corinth and was unfit for further service, Amos Camden Riley, colonel of the 1st Missouri, commanded the regiment. Hugh A. Garland served as the regiment's major; the regiment did not have a lieutenant colonel until Garland was promoted to that rank on May 1, 1863. The regiment's company organization as of November 7, 1862, was: * Company \\"A\\": Originally Company \\"A\\" of the 1st. Commanded by William C. P. Carrington. * Company \\"B\\": Originally Companies \\"A\\", \\"F\\", and \\"G\\" of the 4th. Commanded by Francis McShane. * Company \\"C\\": Originally Companies \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" of the 4th.

Commanded by Charles L. Edmondson. Service history1863=Grand Gulf and Champion Hill After organization, the new regiment was assigned to the First Missouri Brigade. The First Missouri Brigade, commanded by Colonel Francis M. Cockrell, was transferred to the vicinity of Grand Gulf, Mississippi in early March 1863. While at Grand Gulf, the brigade built fortifications. The 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated), along with the 2nd Missouri Infantry, 3rd Missouri Infantry, and Henry Guibor's artillery battery, crossed the Mississippi River to Louisiana to observe Union movements. On April 15, the Missourians were ordered back to Grand Gulf, and the regiment participated in artillery fire with Union naval ships at the Battle of Grand Gulf. After Union Major General Ulysses S. Grant landed in Mississippi in order to move against Vicksburg, Bowen sent many of his men from Grand Gulf to Port Gibson, Mississippi to try to stop Grant. However, the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) was on detached duty guarding a bridge, and missed the ensuing Battle of Port Gibson on May 1. Battle of Champion Hill After Bowen withdrew from the Port Gibson area, the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) was next engaged at the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16. Bowen's division was under the commanded of Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton, and Pemberton had aligned his troops near Champion Hill to try to stop Grant's advance towards Vicksburg. A strong Union assault broke the left flank of the Confederate line, and Cockrell's brigade was sent to try to prevent a complete collapse of the line. The 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) formed on the right end of Cockrell's line, and soon came under heavy Union fire. The regiment then charged the Union position, buying time for Brigadier General Martin E. Green's Confederate brigade to arrive. Together, the brigades of Cockrell and Green, including the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated), charged the Union line, which was driven back some distance. After driving Union troops from a crossroads and recapturing some cannons the Confederates had lost earlier in the battle, the Confederates charged towards the Champion family plantation, which was on a hill and was a key terrain feature. Brigadier General Alvin P. Hovey's Union division was broken by the Confederate charge, and the Confederates kept pressing forward. However, Union reinforcements and a strong line of artillery blunted the charge, and Bowen's men were forced to give up the ground they had gained. The 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) lost six flagbearers at Champion Hill. In total, the regiment lost 46 men killed, 80 wounded, and 52 missing in the fight, for a total of 178. Vicksburg After the retreat from Champion Hill, the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) was next engaged on May 17, at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge. Cockrell's brigade, Green's brigade, and a brigade of Tennessee soldiers commanded by Brigadier General John C. Vaughn had formed a line protecting the bridge over the Big Black River. A Union charge broke the Confederate line, forcing most of the Confederates into a retreat that turned into a rout towards the river crossing. The 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) provided a rear guard for the fleeing Confederates, and was one of the few Confederate units to leave the field without routing. After the fight at the Big Black River, the Confederate army retreated within the defenses of Vicksburg. During the Siege of Vicksburg, the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) helped defeat Union attacks on May 19 and 22, and the regiment captured the flag of the 8th Missouri Infantry (Union) during the former engagement. The regiment also saw action on July 1, helping to plug a gap in the Confederate line after a Union mine exploded a portion of the Confederate line. During the siege, the regiment lost 34 men killed and 59 wounded; the remaining 344 men of the regiment were captured by Union forces when the Confederate garrison surrendered on July 4. After the surrender, the men of the regiment were paroled, and were ordered to wait at Demopolis, Alabama until officially exchanged. Many of the Missourians did not report to Demopolis. The prisoner exchange process was completed on September 12, allowing the unit to rejoin Confederate service. In October, the regiment became part of the division of Major General Samuel French at Meridian, Mississippi. The regiment was later transferred to Mobile, Alabama, and then served patrol duty for a time in northern Alabama. =1864=Atlanta campaign The 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) and Cockrell's Missouri Brigade fought as a unit of the Confederate Army of Tennessee during the Atlanta Campaign from May to September 1864. During the campaign, the regiment was part of French's division of Major General Leonidas Polk's corps. Cockrell, now promoted to brigadier general, still commanded the brigade the regiment was in. Besides the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated), Cockrell's brigade contained the 2nd and 6th Missouri (Consolidated), the 3rd and 5th Missouri (Consolidated), and the 1st and 3rd Missouri Cavalry (Consolidated). The regiment was engaged at the Battle of New Hope Church on May 25 and 26, where Colonel Riley was killed in action. Regimental command then passed to Hugh Garland, who was promoted to colonel on May 30. The regiment was then in combat at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on June 27. At Kennesaw Mountain, the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) and the rest of Cockrell's brigade was part of the Confederate line at a promontory named Pigeon Hill. Cockrell's brigade had deployed skirmishers, who were quickly driven in when the Union troops charged the position on Pigeon Hill. Cockrell's men drove back all of the Union assaults made against their position, and were engaged in combat for about an hour. Cockrell's brigade, including the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated), participated in several smaller engagements during the Atlanta campaign, as well as the Siege of Atlanta. The regiment lost 19 men killed, 57 wounded, and 4 missing over the course of the campaign, for a total of 80. Franklin-Nashville campaign Colonel Hugh A. Garland Jr., killed in action at the Battle of Franklin Cockrell's Missouri troops were heavily engaged in the Battle of Allatoona on October 5, 1864. General John Bell Hood, now commander of the Confederate army, dispatched French's division, which contained Cockrell's brigade, to capture a fortified Union position at Allatoona Pass. At Allatoona, Cockrell's four-regiment brigade aligned with the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) second from the left. Cockrell's brigade initially drove in Union skirmishers and captured an outer redoubt. The 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) captured the flag of the 39th Iowa Infantry. However, the Confederates were unable to capture the main Union fort, and were forced to withdraw. At Allatoona, the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) lost 5 men killed, 37 wounded, and 2 missing, for a total of 44. The regiment also participated in the Battle of Franklin on November 30, 1864. In Franklin, as at Allatoona, the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) was aligned as the second regiment from the left in Cockrell's brigade. Cockrell's brigade reached the main Union line near a cotton gin, where the brigade ran into very heavy fire. Cockrell was wounded during the charge, and command of the brigade fell to Colonel Elijah Gates of the 1st and 3rd Missouri Cavalry (Consolidated), who was also wounded, but remained with the unit. The Confederates were able to break a hole in the Union line, but a strong counterattack drove the Confederates out of the main Union line. The First Missouri Brigade was decimated at Franklin, suffering 419 losses out of the 696 engaged in a frontal assault on the fortified Union lines. The 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated)'s commanding officer, Colonel Hugh A. Garland, was also killed in the charge. Garland had been carrying the regiment's flag when he fell; the flag was captured by Union troops. The regiment had entered the battle with around 100 men, and lost 35 of them killed, 25 wounded, and 2 missing, for a total of 62. The regiment, as well as the rest of the First Missouri Brigade, was on detached duty after Franklin, and missed the Battle of Nashville. =1865= After the failure of the Nashville campaign, the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) was ordered to Mobile, Alabama, where it participated in the defense of Fort Blakely. During the Battle of Fort Blakely on August 9, 1865, the Confederate defenses, including the 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated), were overrun by a strong Union assault. The Missourians were forced to surrender during the fall of the fort, and were sent to Ship Island, Mississippi as prisoners of war. The survivors of the regiment were paroled on May 13, while at Jackson, Mississippi; the war had ended for all effective purposes by that time. Commanders The 1st and 4th Missouri (Consolidated) was commanded by Riley and Garland. Garland had served as lieutenant colonel for the regiment previously, and the consolidated regiment's majors were Garland and Bradford Keith.

While the former hacker has had a long career in music beginning in the underground demoscene in Europe, he is best known for his chiptune, synthwave, and nerdcore tracks. Biography 1974 - 1992: Early Life = Juan Irming was born to Swedish parents on the Spanish island Mallorca in 1974. In the '80s, Irming began to frequent a local computer store in Malm√∂ called Computer Corner. The store had an Atari 130XE in the window that Irming was able to program with scrolling text displaying the store name. The store owners were so impressed, they brought the preteen on as a paid programmer. It was at this time Irming discovered his life-long passion for computer engineering which eventually led him to the demoscene, phone hacking (phreaking), early cracking underground, and computer hacker subculture in Europe. Amplitude Problem's track Computer Corner was a tribute to the store's impact on his formative years as a young hacker. The music video for the song was created by German pixel artist Valenberg, the artist for the point-and-click cyberpunk video game VirtuaVerse. =1992 - Present: Immigration to US= Juan Irming immigrated to the United States from Sweden in the early '90s, to attend Musicians Institute in Hollywood. After his graduation, he spent time to focus on fatherhood and his programming career. Following his steps, his son, Maxwell \\"Max James\\" Irming also earned his degree at Musicians Institute and has pursued a professional career in software engineering and music production. The duo performed on the main stage together at the 2019 DEF CON 27 gathering in Las Vegas. Irming resides in Los Angeles, California and currently works as a senior level software engineer and continues to produce music. Music Juan Irming participating at a Global Game Jam as a music producer in 2019. = 1986 - 1993: Demoscene and Early Career = Juan Irming, known at the time as 7an, began in the European demoscene in the late '80s as a member and composer for the Atari ST demo crew and hacking group SYNC. Irming's \\"tracker music\\" placed first in several demo music contests. It was during this era that Irming began to make extensive use of vintage home computer hardware such as the Commodore 64, Atari 130XE, and the Atari ST in his productions, favoring the SID6581 and YM2149 computer sound chips to create a distinctive style of chiptune music. = 2014 - Present: Chiptune, Synthwave, and Nerdcore = In 2014, Juan Irming, under the new moniker Amplitude Problem, would produce music for American hacker and nerdcore rapper YTCracker and other artists. Amplitude Problem has composed and produced video game inspired synth and chiptune tracks for a number of projects and records. Amplitude Problem produced YTCracker's cyberpunk album Introducing Neals which released on November 5th, 2014 on Guy Fawkes Day. Amplitude Problem's Crime of Curiosity (2019) features well-known American hacker Loyd Blankenship, also known as The Mentor, reading his essay The Hacker Manifesto (originally titled The Conscience of a Hacker) which serves as a guideline and moral code of hackers around the world. Crime of Curiosity is also featured as the official soundtrack to the demoscene history book THE CRACKERS: The Art of Cracking from 1984‚Äì1994. Amplitude Problem has been featured on albums alongside artists like Mitch Murder, Lazerhawk and GUNSHIP. He has appeared live at events and venues such as DEF CON, Comic Con, and Game On Expo with YTCracker, Dual Core, and MC Frontalot. Amplitude Problem produced the album Blue Bots Dots which released in 2015 and garnered favorable reviews. In 2017, he followed-up with the nu jazz album The Frequency Modulators Orchestra, Vol. 1 which critics have described as \\"an artificial world of high-tech joy, pop music for Donkey Kong to jam to.\\" Tracks from the album aired on FM jazz radio stations across the United States. Influences include first-generation chip composers Rob Hubbard, Ben Daglish, Martin Galway and Maniacs of Noise in addition to electronic, industrial, jazz and hip hop acts such as Damokles, Kraftwerk, Jean-Michel Jarre, Alphaville, Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, Herbie Hancock and Public Enemy. He has called his own work \\"retro-future music for geeks, cyberpunks and the occasional normal human being.\\"  Craigslist Hack Marketing Stunt  On November 23, 2014 at 8pm, there was a massive breach on the American classifieds website Craigslist. The attack was allegedly part of a guerrilla marketing campaign for YTCracker's album Introducing Neals on which Amplitude Problem was the lead producer. Visitors of the Craigslist website were forcibly redirected to hacking website DigitalGangster.com, with a following redirect to a YouTube video which Gizmodo describes as a \\"very strange animated rap video [that] filled your ears with lyrics about freedom, privacy, and net neutrality\\". YTCracker denied claims that he was behind the attack and noted he'd likely be accused due to his previous involvement in the criminal hacking scene. It is not yet known which individual or group performed the hack.
