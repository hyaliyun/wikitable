Nevertheless, these decorated eggs have retained much of their pagan symbolism. Examples of Croatian pisanica Many Slavic ethnic groups, including the Belarusians (пісанка, pisanka), Bulgarians (писано яйце, pisano yaytse), Croats (pisanica), Czechs (kraslice), Macedonians (вапцано јајце, vapcano jajce), Poles (pisanka), Serbs (писаница / pisanica), Slovaks (kraslica), Slovenes (pisanica, pirhi or remenke), Sorbs (jejka pisać) and Ukrainians (писанка, pysanka) decorate eggs for Easter. Many of the names derive from the Slavic root pisa which relates to painting (and cognate with Latin pictura). In Slavic tradition, the egg (similar to icons) is written, not drawn or painted. This is a Central and Eastern European and not strictly Slavic tradition, since non-Slavic ethnic groups in the area also practice it: Hungarians (hímestojás), Lithuanians (margutis), and Romanians (ouă vopsite, incondeiate or impistrite). The pattern is often applied to an egg by the process of wax-resist, similar to batik. A stylus is used to apply hot wax to the shell of an egg, which is placed in a series of dye baths. The wax seals the dye into the egg; the colors and pattern are revealed when the wax is removed (by melting it off) at the end. Other techniques include \\"drop- pull\\" eggs, a variation on batik which uses a simple pin head to apply wax; a \\"scratch\\" technique, where dye is applied to an egg and then patterns scratched onto the shell; painted eggs, where the shells are painted using a brush; and various versions of appliqué, where items (straw, paper, beads, sequins) are glued to the shell of an egg. While decorated eggs of various Slavic nations have much in common, national traditions vary.

The campaign was over the control of Taiyuan, the capital of the . The campaign resulted in a communist victory. Prelude After the end of the Central Shanxi campaign, the majority of the province had fallen into the communist hands, and the nationalists were left with only two cities in entire Shanxi: Taiyuan, the provincial capital, and Datong. In order to completely annihilate their nationalist opponents and take control of the entire province, the communists decided to launch the Taiyuan campaign in mid October 1948. The communist commander Xu Xiangqian was put in charge, facing his adversary Yan Xishan, his nationalist counterpart who had just suffered a humiliating defeat in the hands of Xu Xiangqian in the Central Shanxi campaign, but this time, Yan was determined to put a good fight to the end and repeatedly claimed in public that he would die with the city of Taiyuan. Yan Xishan was right in that the communists under the command of Xu Xiangqian had a tough time in taking the city. The communists began to mass their troops in places including Qingyuan (清原), Taigu (太谷) and Yuci (榆次) for the preparation of the attack on the provincial capital. Order of battle First Stage: *Nationalists: 6 Armies totaling 20 Divisions 14 infantry divisions 3 Columns (Divisions) 3 Specialized Divisions *Communists: Units of 7th Column Units of 8th Column Units of 13th Column Units of 15th Column Second Stage: *Nationalists: 2 Corps totaling 6 armies X Corps XV Corps *Communists: Units of XVIII Corps Units of XIX Corps Units of XX Corps Units of the 7th Army Units of the 1st Artillery Division of the Fourth Field Army Units of the 3rd Artillery Division of the communist North China Military Region Strategy Defensive forces map of Taiyuan City NRA defense The nationalist defenders had some significant advantages in terms of geography: the rugged mountainous terrain strongly favored the defenders and prevented large numbers of attackers from being effectively deployed. When the attackers were forced to reduce their numbers, they were furthered confronted by a large numbers of complexes of fortifications and bunkers. The nationalist defense parameter bordered by the Yellow Camp (Huang Zhai, 黄寨) and Zhou Family's Mountain (Zhou Jia Shan, 周家山) in the north, Wuxiu (武宿) and the Town of Little Hotel (Xiao Dian Zhen, 小店 镇) in the south, Rocky Thousand Peak (Shi Qian Feng, 石千峰) in the west, and Han (罕) Mountain in the east. Within this defense parameter, there were more than 5,000 large bunkers outside the city wall alone, and additionally, important positions such as regions of Ox and Camel Camp (Niu Tuo Zhai, 牛驼寨), Lesser Yaodong Head (Xiao Yao Tou,小窑头), Mountain Peak (Shan Tou, 山头), and Zhuo Ma (淖马) to the east of the city, the Twin Pagoda Temple (Shuang Ta Si, 双塔寺) to the southeast of the city, and Crouching Tiger Mountain (Wo Hu Shan, 卧虎山) to the northeast of the city were all fortified as bunker complexes. The nationalist 30th Army was airlifted from Xi'an to Taiyuan to further strengthen the urban defense, while the total nationalist artillery pieces gathered for the defense of the city was more than six hundred. The defenders of Taiyuan itself first divided the city into four sectors, the eastern, western, northern and southern sectors, but this was soon further split into five when the eastern sector was further divided into northeastern and southeastern sectors. A total of eleven divisions were tasked to defend these five defensive sectors while another six divisions were used as mobile strike force. The rest three divisions were used as reserves. To counter the nationalist defense, on September 28, 1948, Xu Xiangqian decided the communist strategy of gradually annihilating the defenders in the outskirt of the city, hopefully when they were out of their fortifications, and then to take the city. The first step was to breach the nationalist defense from southeast and northwest, and preventing the use of the two airports by artillery bombardment. The second step would be taking the nationalist strongholds of Mountain Peak (Shan Tou, 山头), Zhuo Ma (), the Twin Pagoda Temple (Shuang Ta Si, 双塔寺) and others, and the last step was to take the city from northeast and southeast. First stage In order to strengthen the defense of Taiyuan, Yan Xishan had to take as much food and able-bodies recruits as possible from the rural area, so on October 2, 1948, he sent out seven nationalist divisions to do so, and these divisions pushed southward in the region between the Fen River in the east and Tianjin-Pukou Railway in the west. By the next day, the nationalist 44th Division, 45th Division and units of the nationalist 72nd Division reached the region of the town around Little Hotel (Xiao Dian, 小店) and the Village of Southwestern Shore (Xi Nan Ban Cun, 西南畔村) while the nationalist 40th Division, 49th Division, and the 73rd Division reached the region of Autumn Village (Qiu Cun, 秋村) and Western Warm Village (Xi Wen Zhuang, 西温庄), and the nationalist 66th Division and the 69th Division reached the region of Red Temple (Hong Si, 红寺). The communists decided to take this great opportunity of striking the enemy out in the open when they came out of their fortifications by launching the Taiyuan campaign ahead of the original planned schedule. At the dawn of October 5, 1948, the communist 7th Column crossed the Fen River at Qingyuan (清原), and struck eastward to the region north of the town of Little Hotel (Xiao Dian, 小店). In conjunction with the communist 7th Column striking eastward strike, the communist 15th Column struck westward to the north of Wuxiu (武宿) Airport from Tai Gu (太谷) and Yu Ci, (榆次), thus cutting off the escape route of the nationalist forces at Wuxiu (武宿) Airport and Little Hotel (Xiao Dian, 小店) region to Taiyuan. The communist 8th Column and 13th Column besieged the nationalist forces that had just taken regions of Little Hotel (Xiao Dian, 小店) and Southern Black Yaodong, (Nan Hei Yao, 南黑窑). By the early morning of October 6, 1948, the nationalist 44th Division and 45th Division were completely annihilated, while the nationalist 49th Division and 72nd Division were badly mauled. Riding on these successes, the communist took Wuxiu (武宿) Airport and approached the nationalist positions at Eastern Mountain (Dong Shan, 东山) from its southern flank. In accordance with the communist offensive in the Little Hotel (Xiao Dian, 小店) region, communist 7th Column launched its own offensive against nationalists positions at the Phoenix Pavilion Ridge (Feng Ge Liang, 凤阁梁) to the north of the city, annihilating a regiment of the nationalist 68th Division and a battalion of the nationalist 39th Division, and shelled the New Urban (Xin Cheng, 新城) Airport to the north of the city. After eleven days of fierce battle, three nationalist divisions were badly mauled, suffering over 12,000 casualties, and the enemy was at the first defensive line of the city. Both sides took a brief break for regrouping. On October 16, 1948, units of the communist 7th Column, 8th Column, 13th Column, and 15th Column attacked nationalists positions at Eastern Mountain (Dong Shan, 东山) simultaneously from both the south and the north. By October 19, 1948, nationalist stronghold at Eastern Mountain (Dong Shan, 东山) including positions at Black Camel (Hei Tuo, 黑驼), Stone Person Ridge (Shi Ren Liang, 石人梁), Greater Yaodong Head, (Da Yao Tou, 大窑头), Greater and Lesser Northern Point (Da Xiao Bei Jian, 大小北尖), Elm Grove Level Ground (Yu Lin Ping, 榆林坪), Meng's Family's Well (Meng Jia Jing, 孟家井), and Ox and Camel Camp (Niu Tuo Zhai, 牛驼寨). The defenders of the main peak of the Eastern Mountain (Dong Shan, 东山), Mt. Rear (Han Shan, 罕山), consisted of a regiment, was forced to surrender. Yan Xishan deployed the nationalist 30th Army and the 10th Column (Division) consisted of former Japanese troops to launch continuous counterattacks on the communist 7th Column under the artillery coverage, which averaged over 10,000 per day on a position that was merely three hundred square meters. After three days of fierce fighting and suffering extreme heavy casualties, the nationalists were finally able to dislodge the enemy and take back the position. However, the enemy would not give up so easily and was determined to take the position. By October 26, 1948, the communists readjusted their tactics and deployed units of the communist 7th Column, 8th Column, 13th Column, and 15th Column to once again take nationalist positions at Ox and Camel Camp (Niu Tuo Zhai, 牛驼寨), Lesser Yaodong Head (Xiao Yao Tou,小窑头), Mountain Peak (Shan Tou, 山头), and Zhuo Ma (淖马). With air support, the defenders attempted to counterattack but without success, and even with the deployment of gas attack and incendiary rounds, the enemy was able to have the newly gained positions firmly in their hands. After fierce battles of nineteen days, by November 13, 1948, all four nationalist strongholds at Eastern Mountain (Dong Shan, 东山) had been taken and in addition to the 22,000+ casualties suffered, the defenders also lost an entire division when the nationalist 8th Column (Division) defected to the communist side. Meanwhile, units from the communist Central Shanxi Military Region also the town of Green Dragon (Qing Long Zhen, 青龙镇) to the north of the city, the Temple of Xu (Xu Tan, 许坛) to the south of the city, and the South-North Dyke (Nan Bei Yan, 南北堰) on the western bank of Fen River, thus further isolated the defenders by strengthening the siege. The nationalist commander of the 30th Army, Huang Jiaosong (黄樵松), was disillusioned with the nationalist regime and decided to defect, and the communists sent liaison officers into the city to help. However, the conspirators were sold out by one of Huang's subordinates, a divisional commander named Dai Bingnan (戴炳南) and everyone involved was arrested. Based on the letters captured, Yan Xishan erroneously believed that the lead communist liaison officer, Jin Fu (晋夫) was Hu Yaobang, and eventually sent all of the captured conspirators to Chiang Kai-shek, who had all of them executed after failing to obtain any information from them. However, nationalists had committed a serious blunder that would cost them dearly for the rest of the Chinese Civil War: Commander Dai Bingnan (戴炳南) was paid in huge amount of gold for his action but he was not allowed to be evacuated when the fall of the city was imminent. After the fall of the city, Dai Bingnan (戴炳南) attempted to hide under a table in a house and carried the gold on him, but of course he was captured by the communists. After the much publicized propaganda of his capture and a humiliating public trial, Dai Bingnan (戴炳南) was executed in public. The nationalist failure to save lives of informers such as Dai Bingnan (戴炳南) had greatly alienated those within the nationalist own ranks, and since then, most showed their objection to defection by either not joining in or leaving the defecting nationalist units, instead of revealing the conspirators. The idea to leave those informers behind was that since they had no way out, they would fight to the death in the face of communist attack, but this idea rumored to be approved by Chiang had backfired seriously, as proven later in many other similar incidents in the rest of the Chinese Civil War. After the end of Liaoshen campaign, the nationalist force in North China headed by Fu Zuoyi became almost exposed and isolated. The communists feared that if the city of Taiyuan was taken too early which would lead to the complete exposure isolation of the nationalist force in North China, the nationalists would withdraw and avoid annihilation. Furthermore, if the nationalist force in North China was redeployed elsewhere in China, the communists would have great difficulties later on. As a result, a decision was made to temporarily stop the offensive on the city to finish Pingjin campaign first, and then take Taiyuan afterward. While the order was given on November 16, 1948 to stop the assault on the city itself, preparation was also done to further isolate the city. The I Corps of the communist North China Military Region acted accordingly by taking nationalist strongholds to the north of the city, including the Village of Su (Su Cun, 苏村), Yangqu (阳曲), the Orchid Village (Lan Cun, 兰村), and nationalist strongholds to the south of the city, including Huaqitou (化七头), Zhao Family's Village (Zhao Jia Shan, 赵家山), Qi's Ditch (Qi Gou, 邱沟), and nationalist stronghold to the east of the city, the Pine Tree Slope (Song Shu Po, 松树坡). While the defenders were forced into a region of 15 km centered at the city, the communists stopped their offensives and launched another round of psychological warfare by stepping up the political pressure and sending the relatives of the defenders to the front to ask the defenders to surrender. As a result, from December 1, 1948 thru March, 1949, over 12,000 defenders defected to the communists. Second stage After the end of Pingjin campaign, the I Corps, II Corps, and III Corps of the communist North China Military Region were renamed as the XVIII Corps, XIX Corps, and XX Corps respectively, while the 7th Column of the communist Northwest Field Army was renamed as the 7th Army of the First Field Army. In March, 1949, the communist XIX Corps, XX Corps, an artillery division of the Fourth Field Army and another artillery division of the communist North China Military Region were sent to Taiyuan to assist the communist XIX Corps in taking the city. On March 17, 1949, the communists formed the Taiyuan Frontline Command headed by Xu Xiangqian to coordinated the upcoming attack on the city, and Xu was further assisted by Peng Dehuai when he joined the Xu on March 28, 1949. The total communist force totaled more than 320,000, achieving absolute numerical superiority. However, the communists soon realized that due to the mountainous terrain of Taiyuan that strongly favored the defenders, the increased number of communist troops only provided excellent target practice for the defenders of the city because the harsh terrain had prevented large number of attacking force from being deployed in great numbers. In order to avoid wasteful casualties, the communists were forced to reduce their attacking force back to the original level of 100,000 troops in the first stage of the Taiyuan campaign while the rest were deployed as reserves. However, the newly boosted force did provide a welcome relief for communist veterans of the first stage of the campaign, and they were replaced by the fresh communist forces newly arrived. In the first stage of the Taiyuan campaign, Yan Xishan had lost over 40,000 troops, but he was able to rapidly replace the loss with large scale drafting, and decided to fight the communists to proclaiming that he would die with the (Taiyuan) city. The nationalist 83rd Division was airlifted from Yulin, Shaanxi to Taiyuan, and the nationalist force defending the city totaled more than 70,000 troops in six armies, which was reorganized into two corps: the nationalist X Corps and the nationalist XV Corps. A total of twelve divisions were deployed in nationalist strongholds outside the city wall and two divisions were deployed within the city, while the rest of the division served as mobil strike force. However, Yan Xishan was well aware the end was near and he was by no means of having any confidence in the defense of the city and his public proclamation was nothing other than morale boosting only showpiece. On February 5, 1949, Yan Xishan betrayed his promise of dying with the city by fleeing the city via air, and left his trusted lieutenants, Sun Chu (孙楚), the commander of the nationalist X Corps and Wang Jingguo (王靖 国), the commander of the nationalist XV Corps as the commander-in-chief and the deputy commander-in-chief of the urban defense of Taiyuan. On March 31, 1949, the communist Frontline Command of Taiyuan decided to take good positions that could be used to assault the city by first continuously isolating and annihilating defenders in nationalist strongholds outside the city wall, and then taking the city by concentrating available forces. Units of the communist XX Corps and a division from the communist 7th Army would attack the defenders in the nationalist stronghold to the north of the city from northeast and northwest, and other divisions of the communist 7th Army and units of the communist XVIII Corps would attack the city from the east, and units of the communist XIX Corps would attack the city from south and southwest, while the communist XX Corps would attack the city from northeast and southeast. The 1st Artillery Division of the Fourth Field Army and the 3rd Artillery Division of the communist North China Military Region would be under the direct command of the communist Taiyuan Frontline Command, while the 4th Artillery Division of the communist North China Military Region would be attached to the communist XIX Corps and XX Corps. On April 20, 1949, a general assault was launched and with strong artillery support, nationalist strongholds including New City (Xin Cheng, 新城), Crown Price's Head (Tai Zi Tou, 太子头) to the north of the city, Northern Fen River Bridge (Bei Fen He Qiao, 北汾河桥), Greater King's Village (Da Wang Cun, 大王村), Lesser King's Village (Xiao Wang Cun, 小王村) to the southwest of the city, Village of Di (Di Cun, 狄村) and Old Soldiers' Camp (Lao Jun Ying, 老军营) to the south of the city, Hao Family's Ditch (Hao Jia Guo, 郝家沟) and Scissors Bay (Jian Zi Wan, 剪子湾) to the east of the city. By April 22, 1949, the last nationalist stronghold outside the city wall had fallen into the enemy hands and the communists had completely annihilated four nationalist armies garrisoning these strongholds. The communist success meant that two critical locations, the two highest points, the Twin Pagoda Temple (Shuang Ta Si, 双塔寺) and Crouching Tiger Mountain (Wo Hu Shan, 卧虎山) were controlled by the attacking enemy. On April 22, the communists asked the surviving nationalist defenders of the city to surrender in order to minimize the destruction of the city, but their request was refused. In the early morning of April 24, 1949, after shelling the city with over 1,300 artilleries, the final assault on the city begun. The communist XX Corps first breached the city defense at the city wall to the east of the Lesser Northern Gate (Xiao Bei Men, 小北门), and the communist XVIII Corps and XIX Corps soon breached the city defense elsewhere, and fierce street fights broke out within the city. By 9:00 a.m., the nationalist headquarter had fallen and the nationalist commander-in-chief Sun Chu (孙楚) and his deputy Wang Jingguo (王靖 国) were both captured alive along with their Japanese advisory group headed by Nakamura and Iwata by the attacking communists. By 10:00 a.m., the fighting ended and the campaign concluded with the communist victory. Outcome The nationalist defeat in the Taiyuan campaign cost the nationalists over 135,000 troops and the most immediate result of the campaign was that the nationalist garrison at Datong totaling more than 10,000 realized that it was all over after witnessing the nationalist defeat in Taiyuan, and surrendered to the communists without a fight. Communist victory cost them 45,000 troops plus many civilian laborers and it had not only completely ended the 38-year-old reign of Yan Xishan in Shanxi, but also effectively ended the nationalist reign of Shanxi. The Provincial Government with the remaining 500 officials staged a show by mass suicide taking cyanide pills, blew the building up to show their heroic brave defense and loyalty to the Nationalist China. There is a commemorative statue erected in Taiwan with writing from Yan.

In February 2015 he became the BBC's South Asia Correspondent, based in Delhi. In June 2019 he became the BBC's Chief Environment correspondent. Education Rowlatt was born in London in June 1966 and was educated at Hampstead Comprehensive in Cricklewood, and then at Mansfield College, Oxford University. Career Rowlatt has been a correspondent on Newsnight, Channel 4 News and Panorama and has been nominated for Royal Television Society and BAFTA awards for his work. =Early career= One of Rowlatt's first jobs in television was as an assistant producer on current affairs documentary Panorama, where, among many other stories, he worked on a programme which showed how Mercedes, Volkswagen and Volvo car dealers were fixing prices in Britain. During his time on Channel 4 News, he was a passenger on the train involved in the Hatfield rail crash in 2000, reporting that he \\"watched the carriages skid and whip around on the gravel besides the track\\".BBC News Online, page about the crash. =Ethical Man= Justin Rowlatt became widely known in Britain when in 2006 he became Newsnight's \\"Ethical Man\\". On Rowlatt's first day at the programme, Peter Barron, the editor, challenged him and his family to spend a year trying to reduce their impact on the environment. It made him an \\"accidental green hero\\", according to The Guardian. In 2003, that paper had commissioned Leo Hickman to spend a year with his young family on a similar project, which resulted in a book entitled Life Stripped Bare: My Year Trying To Live Ethically. Rowlatt, who acknowledges his debt to Hickman (and to Lucy Siegle, author of Green Living in the Urban Jungle), continued in this vein, focusing on environmental impact, especially his carbon footprint\\"We are told climate change is the biggest threat facing the world but is there anything the average family can do about it? On Monday we find out. The BBC has forced one of its reporters and his family to \\"go green\\" for an entire year. Their challenge? To make as big a cut in the family's carbon footprint as they can.\\" from \\"Go Green or else\\"\\"It has been a long year (it actually started last February) but, I think, a successful one. Take a look at Professor’s Tim final carbon footprint for us. My family’s ethical endeavours succeeded in reducing our total carbon footprint by 20%.\\" from \\"We are all ethical men and women now\\" (rather than, say, labour rights). The strand became popular, with Rowlatt reporting on global warming and environment issues across all BBC outlets. Panorama broadcast an Ethical Man special \\"Go Green or Else\\". In 2007 Rowlatt presented an hour-long prime-time programme exploring how the United States is engaging with the climate issue for BBC Two's This World, titled \\"Can Obama Save the Planet?\\". =Later career= Much of Rowlatt's career has focussed on current affairs and business and economic reporting. He was part of the original reporting team for BBC One's popular prime time factual programme, The One Show, \\"reporting on current affairs with flair\\". He was a relief presenter for BBC Breakfast in 2010 and for BBC Radio 4's PM programme in 2014. During his time as a Newsnight correspondent he caused a minor scandal when the President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, complained about his dress sense. As the host of the World Service's occasional series Exchanges on the World Economy, Rowlatt has interviewed some of the most high-profile economists in the world, including Joseph Stiglitz and Nassim Taleb. He was the main presenter on the World Service's flagship business programme, Business Daily. He presented the Radio 4 popular science/economics strand \\"The Elements\\", which explored the role of the chemical elements in the world economy, and co-presented two series of the BBC Two personal finance programmes MoneyWatch. He presented the Business section of the Today Programme. In 2008 Rowlatt became the first television journalist to interview a serving MI6 agent; the intelligence service was seeking to broaden its recruitment. Rowlatt says of his interviewing technique, \\"It wasn’t like a Paxman interview but I was trying to get under his skin a bit and understand what it was like to do his job.\\" Under the hot camera lights, the agent's false moustache slipped from his lip. His technique evidently annoyed Sir Alan Sugar, the entrepreneur at the centre of The Apprentice. In a 2014 interview Rowlatt asked him about alleged bullying; Sugar objected, accused him of \\"gutter journalism\\", and walked out. Rowlatt has presented a number of prime time television series including The Trouble with Working Women with Sophie Raworth. The May 2009 programme caused controversy when at management consultancy Accenture he suggested a female-heavy office must have been full of secretaries. In 2011 he presented The Chinese Are Coming, a pair of documentaries looking at the growing influence of China in Africa and in the Americas. Also in 2011 he co-presented, with fellow journalist Anita Rani, the two-part documentary travelogue India on Four Wheels, a road trip around India sampling the changes and problems the growing car usage has brought to the country in the last two decades (see Transport in India#Automobiles). The format proved successful, and the pair collaborated on two two-part follow- ups, first China on Four Wheels, which aired in September 2012, (see Transport in China#Motor vehicles) and then Russia on Four Wheels (see Transport in Russia#Roads and highways), which aired in January 2014. Rowlatt and Rani had a \\"jokey, human interest, quick-in-and-out approach\\" Rowlatt reports regularly for From Our Own Correspondent. His dispatches have included reflections on his experiences with the Awa tribe in the Amazon, the time he discussed gay rights while taking a sauna with two homophobic Russians, and what India's space scientists and street children have in common. Rowlatt was a foreign correspondent, as the BBC's lead reporter for the entire South Asia region. He took up the post in Delhi for two years, starting February 2015. One of his first assignments was the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. That summer he went undercover to Thalsevana, a holiday resort taken over by the Sri Lankan military during the civil war. Since 2019 he has been chief environment correspondent.Justin Rowlatt Q&A; BBC; 12 June 2020 Personal life Rowlatt is married to writer and former BBC World Service producer Bee Rowlatt and they have four children. The family appears in the year-long filming of Ethical Man, and \\"Ethical Wife\\" contributed independently to the series by investigating his oil company holdings. She has written of their relationship and family life in her book Talking About Jane Austen in Baghdad. The couple jointly presented the 2013 documentary Make Me a German. Rowlatt's paternal great-grandfather, Sir Sidney Rowlatt, was a prominent judge on the King's Bench Division of the High Court of England and Wales. In 1918, he headed the controversial Rowlatt Committee to evaluate terrorism and seditious movements in British India, and drafted the repressive Rowlatt Act, which authorised stricter press censorship and the arrest and indefinite detention of suspects without due process. The passage of the Act in March 1919 ignited protests across the subcontinent and led directly to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (also known as the Amritsar Massacre); it has been cited as a major factor in stimulating and expanding the Indian independence movement. As the South Asia correspondent for the BBC, Justin Rowlatt acknowledged his family connection in August 2017. In a BBC article examining the post-1947 India-British relationship, he said he had initially been worried his surname would prove a handicap during his posting in India, but that it had not, as the nation had largely moved on. His maternal grandfather, Theo Ionides, was born in 1900 and, although eager to participate in World War I, just missed action. He studied engineering at Oxford University, and went to India to work with Ralli Brothers until it folded in the 1930s. When World War II started, Ionides joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve.

Jahangiri was the minister of industries and mines from 1997 to 2005 under President Mohammad Khatami. Before that, he was the governor of Isfahan Province. He was also a member of Parliament for two terms. Early life and education Jahangiri was born on 21 January 1958 in Sirjan County, Kerman Province. He graduated from University of Kerman with a degree in physics. He was active in revolutionary groups prior to the Iranian Revolution and once was wounded by the forces of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. He later received a PhD from Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch, Tehran in industrial management. He is married to Manijeh Jahangiri and has four children, Hossein, Hesam, Faezeh and Hoda. Political career President Rouhani and Jahangiri in Saadabad Palace Jahangiri began his political career following the Iranian revolution. He became deputy head of the agriculture department in Kerman in July 1980. Then, he was appointed its head in 1982. He was elected to the Iranian Parliament in 1984 election. He was also reelected in next election. He was appointed governor of Isfahan on 1 September 1992 by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to replace with Gholamhossein Karbaschi. He held the position until 20 August 1997 when he was nominated by Mohammad Khatami as the minister of mines and metals and was confirmed by the Parliament. His portfolio was later changed to the minister of industries and mines and he held that position until President Ahmadinejad's cabinet took over in 2005. In 2008, it was rumored that Jahangiri would run for a seat in the Parliament but he denied it. =2013 presidential election and vice presidency= Jahangiri was a potential reformist's candidate in 2013 presidential election but he withdrew in favor of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and then became Rafsanjani's campaign manager. He was a co-founder of Executives of Construction Party and served as its secretary general from 2006 to 2010. He was also a member of Mir-Hossein Mousavi's presidential campaign in 2009 presidential election. On 23 July 2013, it was reported that Jahangiri would be the next First Vice President and would be appointed by Rouhani after his inauguration.هشت نفر از اعضای کابینه روحانی نهایی شدند +اسامی Iran Elect On 29 July, it was confirmed officially, pending his appointment for the post in the inauguration day.اسامی 33 نفر از اعضای کابینه دولت تدبیر و امید/ تغییرات در فهرست نهایی تا روز تحلیف ادامه دارد Iran Elect He was formally appointed on 4 August by Rouhani as his first vice president, replacing Mohammad-Reza Rahimi. =2017 presidential election= In April 2017, it was announced the Jahangiri would register as a candidate for the 2017 Iranian presidential elections. He was successfully vetted and approved by the Guardian Council on 20 April 2017 and officially became a presidential candidate. Many viewed his decision to run for the presidency as a tactical decision to support Rouhani throughout the debates and then withdraw before the voting commenced. He withdrew on 16 May 2017. Later, Hassan Rouhani won the election and Jahangiri was reappointed as first vice president. COVID-19 outbreak On 4 March 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic became known to have spread to Iran, the IranWire website reported that Jahangiri had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019. However, there was no immediate confirmation from Iranian officials. On 11 March, his infection was confirmed by semi-official Fars News Agency. On 15 March, his office announced that he \\"tested negative for coronavirus and since he has fully recovered, he returned to his office and resumed his job\\".

It's now most commonly seen as part of gilded picture frames, but was in use for many smaller decorative mouldings from the later part of the Baroque period.  Compo recipes  A basic compo recipe can have many variations. Some understanding of what each ingredient is doing helps when adjusting the basic recipe: * Whiting gives body. * Pearl glue acts as a binder. * Linseed oil makes the mixture soft. * Rosin makes the mixture elastic. * Venice turpentine prevents cracking. * Glycerine tempers the glue. * Zinc oxide prevents formation of mould.

It runs from PR 391 northwest of Thompson to local streets in Gillam. The route is long, which during its length, passes several large lakes and intersects with one provincial road, PR 290, just north of Gillam. The route is very scenic, passing through dense forests and rural lands. The route supplies three municipalities, Thompson, Split Lake, and Gillam. From its terminus north of Thompson, Manitoba to the town Gillam, PR 280 is classified as a Class A1 Provincial Route. PR 280 was designated in 1987 as a connector from Thompson to Gillam with a spur to Sundance.  Route description  PR 280 begins at an intersection north of Thompson on the shores of Birch Tree Lake with PR 391\\\\. PR 280 runs northeast from PR 391 as a two-lane gravel road through the dense woods north of Thompson Airport. As the road bends to the northeast, it runs west of Mystery Lake, which is connected by a gravel road that runs to the shoreline. Continuing northeast, PR 280 leaves the Mystery Lake area and soon reaches a dirt road that connects to nearby Moak Lake. After Moak Lake, PR 280 continues northeast past Wasakamew Lake and Orr Lake while paralleling the Burntwood River. After Putkawakan Lake, PR 280 turns eastward along the Burntwood River, which soon drains into Split Lake. The road turns northeast away from the river and runs into a junction with a winter road that connects to the settlement of Split Lake. Paralleling the north shore of eponymous lake, PR 280 runs to the northeast from Split Lake and starts wandering through the dense woods of northern Manitoba. Yellow single vehicle bridge on PR 280\\\\. Approaching the western end of Stephens Lake, PR 280 turns east and soon to the southeast as it reaches the northern shore of the lake. Passing a local connector to the shore, the route reaches a junction with the southern terminus of PR 290, which connects to the abandoned settlement of Sundance. At this junction, PR 280 turns west, reaching the shores of the Nelson River. The route crosses over the Nelson River and reaches the settlement of Long Spruce. After Long Spruce, PR 280 runs west along the southern shore of the Nelson River then turns south and southwest away from the river. The route winds west, then turns to the northwest, approaching the river and Stephens Lake. Paralleling railroad tracks, PR 280 passes an electrical substation as it enters the city of Gillam. Through the northeastern section of Gillam, the route crosses over the railroad tracks and turn north and west in short order. Running southwest, PR 280 reaches the access point to Gillam Airport and soon enters downtown Gillam. Through downtown Gillam, PR 280 reaches a junction with Batnau Road, which marks the eastern terminus of the highway. Batnau Road connects to downtown Gillam.  \\"Worst road in Manitoba\\"  In a Canadian Automobile Association survey conducted in April 2015, PR 280 was voted the worst road in Manitoba. On May 16, 2016, CBC News reported that vehicles were becoming stranded or damaged by \\"big bogs of mud\\" on PR 280. Later that same month, local protestors blockaded the road to demand remediation of its unsafe \\"potholes and ruts.\\" A representative of Tataskweyak Cree Nation reported trucks, buses and private vehicles becoming stuck in mud.  History  Brown single vehicle bridge on PR 280\\\\. Before PR 280 existed, the only ways to the northern terminus town of Gillam was via a nearby airport to the southeast of town and the railway line that stretched from Thompson to northern parts of Manitoba. The railway opened in 1929. PR 280 was designated by the Manitoba Ministry of Infrastructure and Transportation in 1987 as a designated gravel road from PR 391 northwest of Thompson to Gillam with an unnumbered spur to Sundance. PR 290 was designated on the spur in 1989. On March 28, 2002, the government of Manitoba order out an CAD$84.8 million plan to work on its province's roads. $940,000 was spent for gravel stabilization beginning at PR 391 and ending in Gillam. This work was also under the Community Main Access Gravel Road Stabilization Program. $700,000 of this $84 million went for additional gravel between 391 and PR 290. $600,000 went to road development near Wasakamew Lake, north of PR 391.

The earliest experiments were done by Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and improved upon by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (1784–1846). A much more accurate experiment using a torsion balance was carried out by Loránd Eötvös starting around 1885, with further improvements in a lengthy run between 1906 and 1909. Eötvös's team followed this with a series of similar but more accurate experiments, as well as experiments with different types of materials and in different locations around the Earth, all of which demonstrated the same equivalence in mass. In turn, these experiments led to the modern understanding of the equivalence principle encoded in general relativity, which states that the gravitational and inertial masses are the same. It is sufficient for the inertial mass to be proportional to the gravitational mass. Any multiplicative constant will be absorbed in the definition of the unit of force. Eötvös's original experiment If the ratio of F1 to F2 differed from the ratio of G1 to G2, the rod would rotate. The mirror is used to monitor the rotation. Direction of the centrifugal force in relation to gravity on the surface of earth. Eötvös's original experimental device consisted of two masses on opposite ends of a rod, hung from a thin fiber. A mirror attached to the rod, or fiber, reflected light into a small telescope. Even tiny changes in the rotation of the rod would cause the light beam to be deflected, which would in turn cause a noticeable change when magnified by the telescope. As seen from the Earth's frame of reference (or \\"lab frame\\", which is not an inertial frame of reference), the primary forces acting on the balanced masses are the string tension, gravity, and the centrifugal force due to the rotation of the Earth. Gravity is calculated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which depends on gravitational mass. The centrifugal force is calculated by Newton's laws of motion and depends on inertial mass. The experiment was arranged so that if the two types of masses were different, the two forces will not act in exactly the same way on the two bodies, and over time the rod will rotate. As seen from the rotating \\"lab frame\\", the string tension plus the (much smaller) centrifugal force cancels the weight (as vectors), while as seen from any inertial frame the (vector) sum of the weight and the tension makes the object rotate along with the earth. For the rod to be at rest in the lab frame, the reactions, on the rod, of the tensions acting on each body, must create a zero net torque (the only degree of freedom is rotation on the horizontal plane). Supposing that the system was constantly at rest – this meaning mechanical equilibrium (i.e. net forces and torques zero) – with the two bodies thus hanging also at rest, but having different centrifugal forces upon them and consequently exerting different torques on the rod through the reactions of the tensions, the rod then would spontaneously rotate, in contradiction with our assumption that the system is at rest. So the system cannot exist in this state; any difference between the centrifugal forces on the two bodies will set the rod in rotation. Further improvements Initial experiments around 1885 demonstrated that there was no apparent difference, and Eötvös improved the experiment to demonstrate this with more accuracy. In 1889 he used the device with different types of sample materials to see if there was any change in gravitational force due to materials. This experiment proved that no such change could be measured, to a claimed accuracy of 1 in 20 million. In 1890 he published these results, as well as a measurement of the mass of Gellért Hill in Budapest.R. v. Eötvös, Mathematische und Naturwissenschaftliche Berichte aus Ungarn, 8, 65, 1890 The next year he started work on a modified version of the device, which he called the \\"horizontal variometer\\". This modified the basic layout slightly to place one of the two rest masses hanging from the end of the rod on a fiber of its own, as opposed to being attached directly to the end. This allowed it to measure torsion in two dimensions, and in turn, the local horizontal component of g. It was also much more accurate. Now generally referred to as the Eötvös balance, this device is commonly used today in prospecting by searching for local mass concentrations. Using the new device a series of experiments taking 4000 hours was carried out with Dezsö Pekár (1873–1953) and Jenő Fekete (1880–1943) starting in 1906. These were first presented at the 16th International Geodesic Conference in London in 1909, raising the accuracy to 1 in 100 million.R. v. Eötvös, in Verhandlungen der 16 Allgemeinen Konferenz der Internationalen Erdmessung, G. Reiner, Berlin, 319,1910 Eötvös died in 1919, and the complete measurements were only published in 1922 by Pekár and Fekete. Related studies Eötvös also studied similar experiments being carried out by other teams on moving ships, which led to his development of the Eötvös effect to explain the small differences they measured. These were due to the additional accelerative forces due to the motion of the ships in relation to the Earth, an effect that was demonstrated on an additional run carried out on the Black Sea in 1908. In the 1930s a former student of Eötvös, János Renner (1889–1976), further improved the results to between 1 in 2 to 5 billion., with abstract in German Robert H. Dicke with P. G. Roll and R. Krotkov re-ran the experiment much later using improved apparatus and further improved the accuracy to 1 in 100 billion. They also made several observations about the original experiment which suggested that the claimed accuracy was somewhat suspect. Re-examining the data in light of these concerns led to an apparent very slight effect that appeared to suggest that the equivalence principle was not exact, and changed with different types of material. In the 1980s several new physics theories attempting to combine gravitation and quantum mechanics suggested that matter and anti-matter would be affected slightly differently by gravity. Combined with Dicke's claims there appeared to be a possibility that such a difference could be measured, this led to a new series of Eötvös-type experiments (as well as timed falls in evacuated columns) that eventually demonstrated no such effect. A side-effect of these experiments was a re-examination of the original Eötvös data, including detailed studies of the local stratigraphy, the physical layout of the Physics Institute (which Eötvös had personally designed), and even the weather and other effects. The experiment is therefore well recorded.

Background Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, the conflict also rooted from the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had realized that his nationalist regime simply lacked the troops or the transportation to deploy his troops into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Unwilling to let the communists, who already dominated most rural regions in China to expand their territories by accepting the Japanese surrender to control the Japanese-occupied regions, Chiang ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet regime not to surrender to the communists but to keep their fighting capabilities to \\"maintain order\\" in the Japanese-occupied regions and to fight off the communists as necessary, until the final arrivals and completion of the deployment of the nationalist troops. As a result, most members of the Japanese puppet regime and their military forces rejoined the nationalists. However, most of the former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime forces were not from Chiang's own clique but were mainly consisted of troops of warlords, who were only nominally under Chiang before the war since they were nationalists in name only and mostly maintained their independent and semi-independent status. The warlords wanted only their own power and defected to the Japanese invaders, who offered to let them keep power in exchange for collaboration. After the war, the forces of thw Japanese puppet regime once again returned to the nationalists for the same reason they had defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to get rid of the warlords immediately as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, which would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks. The former Japanese puppet regime's warlords could still help the nationalists gain more territories by holding on to what was under their control until Chiang completed the deployment of his own troops to take over the regions. Chiang objective was to solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the communists together, which proved to be an extremely-fatal mistake for his nationalist regime later, as would be shown in the conflict. Nationalist strategy In accordance with his strategy to solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, Chiang Kai-shek and his followers had hoped that these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords who rejoined the nationalists would be able to hold on to the regions long enough for Chiang to deploy his own troops by holding off communistss. If the communists were victorious in such conflicts, however, the result would still benefit to Chiang and China because the power of the warlords would be reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, and the warlord problem plagued China for so long could thus be greatly reduced, and the communists would be weakened and so Chiang's own troops would have an easier time to take control. For the former nationalist forces that turned toward the Japanese puppet regime forces, the warlords and their troops had no problem to follow Chiang's orders, and they were eager to prove themselves. The warlords and their troops were well aware that their collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War made them hated by the general population in China, including the nationalists who refused to surrender to the enemy and fought the enemy until the eventual victory. Therefore, in the impending demilitarization after World War II, they were certainly be disarmed and discharged, which would probably be the best outcome, and the power of the warlords would be reduced or even completely eliminated as a result. Chiang orders not to surrender to the communists and to them fight off the saved the warlords, whose troops could legitimize themselves and thus retain their power. Communist strategy The communist strategy was much simpler than that of the nationalists because there was not large division im the communist ranks, unlike for the nationalists. The communists already earned considerable popular support by being the only Chinese force left in the region fighting the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime after the nationalists withdrew, and after successfully establishing communist bases in the rural regions, a better life was provided to the general populace than to that of Japanese-occupied regions. The general Chinese populace agreed that the communists deserved to represent China, to accept the invaders' surrender in the region, and to take over the regions occupied by the invaders. Battle After the former nationalist forces that turned to the Japanese puppet regime and then rejoined the nationalists after World War II had refused to surrender to the communists, the only Chinese forces in the region was under the command of Chiang Kai-shek's regime, a unit of the communist New Fourth Army, from the 4th Sub-Military Region of the communist Central Jiangsu Military Region, launched its offensive in Rugao, Jiangsu, China against those units. Unable to fend off the communist attack and without any popular support from the local populace, the entire nationalist Independent Brigade of the Second Front Army garrisoning Rugao, totaling more than 3,000, was completely annihilated. Everyone, including the commander Kong Ruiwu (孔瑞五) and the deputy commander Li Ruisheng (李瑞生) was either killed or captured alive. Also, the communists succeeded in capturing two mortars, 22 machine guns, and more than 2,600 other firearms. Aftermath Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, thw conflict also showed that Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism simultaneously proved to be a fatal mistake. Although the result of the campaign turned out exactly as Chiang and his subordinates had predicted, and consequently the power of the warlords in this region was indeed reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists and so the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long was thus reduced for that particular region. Chiang's secondary objective was achieved here, but any positive gains obtained by the nationalists were negated by the political fallout. The reason was that the success of achieving the secondary objective came at a huge cost in nationalists' loss of popular support in the region, which had been dominated by the Japanese, because the local population had already blamed nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders. It also reassigned the former Japanese puppet regime forces as the nationalist forces to fight the communists, the only Chinese force left in the regions, which only further alienated the local populace and strengthened the popular resentment to Chiang's nationalist regime.

It is named after Indra in allusion to Lord Indra, the king of deities in Hindu mythology. Arthur Coke Burnell, a renowned orientologist, in his 1875 book, \\"On the Aindra school of Sanskrit grammars\\" details this school. Burnell believed that most non- Pāṇinian systems of Sanskrit grammar were traceable to this school of grammar, believed to be the oldest and reputed to be founded by Indra himself. Aindra, Katantra schools and the Tolkappiyam Burnell's search for the Aindra school took him to Southern India where he came across the Tamil grammatical work Tolkappiyam. A preface of this work, written during the twelfth century CE by Ilampuranar describes the work as aindiram nirainda Tolkappiyam ('comprising Aindra'). This, Burnell posits is an allusion to the pre-Pāṇinian Aindra school of grammar. Further, Burnell proceeded to do an exhaustive comparison of the Tokappiyam with two non-Pāṇinian schools of grammar, namely, the Katantra school of Sanskrit grammar and the Kaccayana, a Pali school of Southern India. Based on the comparisons and allowing for divergences due to the structural differences between Tamil and Sanskrit/Pali, Burnell concluded that the Tolkappiyam corresponds to the Katantra school minutely and across the board. He also demonstrated that many of the technical terms of the Tolkappiyam and of later Tamil grammars were merely simple translations of Sanskrit terms which he attributes to the Aindra school or the other pre-Pāṇinian texts. While his demonstration of the influence of Sanskrit on the Tolkappiyam has met with some approval, his attribution and approximation of all non Pāṇinian schools of Sanskrit grammar with the Aindra school has met with resistance.George Cardona, Pāṇini: a survey of research (1998), Motilal Banarsidass Publ., pp 151Takanobu Takahashi, Tamil Love Poetry and Poetics (1995) Brill Academic Publishers pp 26 Some scholars have also taken a less committal line on the question of Sanskrit influence itself.\\"...it has been identified that Tolkappiyam and other Sanskrit grammar works share some charactersitics, but also show significant dissimilarities...\\" - Rajam, V. S.

Its plot follows the seventeen-year-old Hava Aaronson, an Orthodox Jewish girl living in New York City, as she is invited to live in Hollywood for the summer to star on a fictional television show, The Goldbergs. Plot summary Living in Los Angeles is Hava's first experience living outside the Orthodox Jewish world, however, and she finds herself questioning her relationship to Judaism, to Orthodoxy, and to God. These are illustrated through quirky, often humorous episodes, including one where Hava is unwittingly kept working until Shabbos, and another where she stumbles into a man who may or may not be Orson Welles. The book's unconventional tone and unpredictable nature have elicited comparisons to Kurt Vonnegut and Francesca Lia Block. The book's centerpiece, a scene where Hava and her friend Moish flee the sitcom set and road-trip to Berkeley, California. Some of the personalities are based on real people, including an Orthodox film director and a Hasidic rebbetzin who is also a hip- hop M.C. Background Roth has admitted that much of the book pertains to his own struggle between his Orthodox religion, punk culture, and not fitting in with other fundamentalists. Its title was not originally intended as a reference to The Goldbergs, the radio show created by Gertrude Berg in 1929, which Roth has said he discovered halfway through writing the novel, but he kept it as a panegyric.

(via Aol Auto) and concerns several things: maximum service life in either mileage or time (duration), relationship of components to this lifespan, identification of factors that might afford control in extending the lifespan. Barring an accidental end to the lifespan, a car would have a life constrained by the earliest part to fail.\\"Report: Cars, trucks racking up more miles\\" USA Today 28 January 2006 Some have argued that rust and other factors related to the body of a car are the prime limits to extended longevity.Bob Sikorsky \\"Family Car can last 1,500,000 Miles or a Lifetime The Auto Channel Background An automobile is a highly engineered collection of complex components, each of which has its own lifespan and longevity characteristics. The MTBF (mean time between failures) of some components is expected to be smaller than the life of the car, as the replacement of these is considered part of regular maintenance. Other components, which typically experience less wear, are expected to have a longer life; however, a large longevity may very well require replacement of several of these, raising issues of economics. The most expensive part of an electric car built in the 2020s is the battery, and its lifetime is expected to be about 16 years, or about 2 million kilometres (1.2 million miles) if the car driven a lot. The motivation for pursuing longevity can vary. The economic trade-off of the remaining value versus repair cost is usually considered when deciding to repair or discard. Other factors, such as emotional attachment or a desire to reduce waste, may also be involved. The life of the auto, as the collection, follows, according to a very common model, a bathtub-like pattern. After an initial phase, where failure because of design and manufacturing defects as opposed to wear-out, is more likely (hence the offering of the warranties by the manufacturer), there may be a long period of unlikely failure. The maximum lifespan and future value as a classic for any car are typically not known when the car is purchased. Research into longevity of vehicles will improve the ability to predict car life, with such things as a life table for cars. Statistics In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency assumes the typical car is driven 24,000 kilometres (15,000 miles) per year. According to the New York Times, in the 1960s and 1970s, the typical car reached its end of life around 161,000 kilometres (100,000 miles), but due to manufacturing improvements in the 2000s, such as tighter tolerances and better anti-corrosion coatings, the typical car lasts closer to 322,000 kilometres (200,000 miles). Factors related to longevity of vehicle Sikorsky and others, have developed lists that itemize steps that a car owner can take, or identified operating and maintenance rules, to ensure maximal longevity. :1. Regular oil changes :2. Monitor the key fluids :3. Maintain the transmission :4. Change the spark plugs as needed :5. Replace the timing belt as recommended (if applicable) :6. Replace air filter as required :7. Know and use your maintenance manual :8. No sudden starts and stops :9. Plentiful low cost replacement parts being available In a public economics sense, Kasmer argues that retrofitting autos with a newer transmission would extend the lifespan while at the same time increase fuel efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, and prevent the sudden influx of discarded vehicles into the waste bin as cars are junked to be replaced by a modern vehicle. However, with replacement parts for modern cars becoming ever more high tech, expensive and proprietary and therefore difficult to obtain (due to OEM copyright), many critical components are no longer available at low cost from third party aftermarket suppliers. Due to this fact, most modern cars can no longer be maintained once repair cost of the car exceed resale value. This trend has led to the modern cars being labeled as the first ever \\"disposable\\" cars. Notable examples of high mileage Some car manufacturers support a \\"high mileage\\" club. For example, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz have a \\"High Mileage Award\\" program in which owners who drive 250,000, 500,000, 750,000, and 1 million kilometres (156,000, 311,000, 466,000, 622,000 miles) are awarded with a certificate and a radiator grille badge. Many non-commercial vehicles (both auto and truck) have exceeded 1,610,000 kilometres (1,000,000 miles). For instance, in 2013, East Patchogue, New York resident Irv Gordon (1940-2018) had accumulated 4.82 million kilometres (3 million miles) in his 1966 Volvo P1800. The car had amassed 5.15 million kilometres (3.2 million miles) by Gordon's death on 15 November 2018.\\\\- The First Car to 3 Million Miles?

Notes and references Category:Virginia Tech shooting Virginia Tech shooting ","title":"Timeline of the Virginia Tech shooting"},{"id":"10762779","text":"Peace Like a River (2001) is a best-selling novel by Leif Enger, who took the title from the lyrics of the hymn \\"It Is Well with My Soul\\", which was performed at his wedding. Enger wrote the novel to amuse his family, taking story suggestions from his children and giving the lead character asthma to encourage one of his sons, who also has asthma.  Synopsis The novel opens in 1951 when Reuben Land is born with faulty lungs; it is his father, Jeremiah, who miraculously and heroically saves his life. Reuben, the eleven- year-old narrator, goes on to explain that his father performed several true miracles in his lifetime, the first of which was the aforementioned bringing Reuben to life. Jeremiah is an extremely religious single father to three children: Davy, the oldest, Reuben, the middle child, and the youngest and only daughter, Swede. The Lands lead a calm life in the small town of Roofing until Jeremiah, who is also the school janitor, prevents the town's bullies, Israel Finch and Tommy Basca, from attacking Davy's girlfriend in the school locker room. After this, the Lands go on a hunting trip at Jeremiah's old friend August's house, at which Davy avoids his father and Reuben attempts to shoot a gun. When they return home, they find that their front door has been tarred, presumably by Basca and Finch. One evening Jeremiah takes Reuben to the new church he has been attending, but Reuben skips out of most of the ceremony to spend time with his crush, Bethany Orchard. When he returns to the main chapel, he finds several people including his father speaking in foreign tongues and writhing on the ground, and when the two return from church, they find that the visibly-shaken Swede has just returned from being briefly kidnapped by Basca and Finch. They celebrate her 9th birthday the next day and try to distract her with Western-themed gifts, which she adores and happily accepts, as well as a nicer-than-usual dinner. However, Lurvy, a travelling salesman and friend of Jeremiah’s, interrupts their dinner, greedily eating a lot of Jeremiah's specialty soup. Surprisingly, however, they never run out. Sometime after Swede's birthday, Reuben wakes up in the middle of the night to two people breaking into their house. Davy, who also happens to be awake with a gun clutched in his hands, warns Reuben to remain quiet. When Finch and Basca appear at the bedroom door, Davy commands them to turn on the lights before shooting both of them dead. Life for the Lands quickly deteriorates; Davy goes to jail, and Jeremiah is fired from his job. For the trial, the Lands stay with their lawyer, Mr. DeCuellar, as well as his wife. At the trial, Reuben testifies and realizes that, partly due to his own faults during his testimony, Davy is not going to win. Because of this, Swede and Reuben later concoct a plan to break Davy out of jail, but, when waiting, they fall asleep, and when they wake, the siblings find out that Davy has already escaped on his own. The Lands wait to hear about Davy. (He had first stolen a horse before hitchhiking his way to August's, then borrowing a car and leaving for some unknown destination.) Meanwhile, the police and a federal investigator named Andreeson press the Lands for information and encourage them to turn in Davy if he makes contact, but Jeremiah refuses to cooperate. Furthermore, Jeremiah, based entirely on faith that he will find his son, decides to sell the house and pursue Davy in a new mobile home that he inherited from the now dead Lurvy. Jeremiah, Reuben, and Swede pack up all of their things and head West for August's house. They learn that Andreeson has been by and he is likely following them, but still no one knows where Davy is headed. While they are resting in a small town in North Dakota, Andreeson approaches them from his nearby car, but Jeremiah rebukes everything the \\"fed\\" has to say. And while this was being done, Swede secretly sabotages Andreeson's car, meaning that the Lands can now escape. Subsequently, they all travel for hours without stopping at a gas station because Andreeson had placed police officers all along their route to look for them. Miraculously, they do not run out of fuel, though, and they are never spotted, despite the distinct mobile home. Finally, they stop into a gas station in the badlands. A woman named Roxanna Cawley runs it, and she invites them to stay in her home and wait out the incoming snowstorm. The Lands resume a somewhat normal life at Roxanna's: Jeremiah recovers from pneumonia that he had contracted back in Roofing and begins to court Roxanna. Even still, Andreeson appears from time to time, and eventually, Jeremiah gives in to the officer's requests for help looking for Davy, as it appears that Andreeson just wants to get Davy back. One day while he is near the barn, Reuben sees a figure on a horse atop a hill and instantly recognizes it as Davy. Despite his troubled lungs, Reuben decides to hike up the snowy hill and reunite with his brother. After some convincing, Davy reluctantly agrees to show Reuben where he is living. A man by the name of Jape Waltzer owns—even this is put into question—the small cabin where Davy is living and also has a young girl named Sara that he intends to marry once she is old enough. He has taken in Davy, which was kind, but is a cruel man and the antithesis of Jeremiah. After he sees this, Reuben is conflicted about telling anyone about Davy's whereabouts, but Davy makes him promise to keep it a secret. Andreeson, hot on the case, goes missing during a snowstorm, and Reuben theorizes that Waltzer lured the federal agent away from the nearby town to kill him. Because of this, Reuben tells Jeremiah. As a result, a search party attempts to find Waltzer and Davy, but nothing comes of it. The Lands and Roxanna eventually move back home and rent a farm; soon after, Jeremiah and Roxanna are married. Life returns to normal until Davy shows up one night with Sara in a car he stole from Waltzer. The family reconnects that night, knowing that Davy will have to leave the following day. As Davy prepares to leave the next morning, Waltzer shoots from where he had been waiting, hitting both Jeremiah and Reuben. As the commotion continues, Reuben describes a beautiful meadow where he and Jeremiah meet, presumably heaven, with his dad laughing and then drifting away in a river. Reuben wakes up to find himself alive, Jeremiah dead, Davy gone, and Waltzer never to be seen again. The narrative jumps forward in time, explaining that Roxanna continued to raise them and Sara stayed on the farm. Swede, with her flair for drama and love of literature, became a famous writer, Davy escaped to Canada, and Reuben happily married Sara.

In the 1950s and 1960s during Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution his reputation came under attack and his body was exhumed and burned.  Biography  Wu was born Wu Qi () as the seventh child among his siblings, at Wuzhuang, Tangyi county (堂邑县, a part of Guan county nowadays). His father died when he was a child, leaving him to fend for himself. Too poor to attend the local academy, Wu determined to promote universal free education,Suzanne Pepper, Radicalism and education reform in 20th-century China: the search for an ideal development model, Cambridge University Press, pp.167-169. supposedly because he was swindled for his illiterateness. A wandering beggar, Wu educated himself and used his little money to develop business ventures. Eventually he achieved success as a businessman, but he continued to beg, using the money he got to fund the foundation of local academies in Shandong. In the last decade of his life, Wu was a successful money lender and landlord, and he used his earnings to found three charity traditional academies. He got the bestowed name Xun from the court later. Wu never married, and he fostered the second grandson of his eldest brother. Reputation Wu's life and work was promoted as exemplary by many leading figures in the imperial court of the Qing dynasty. After his death in 1896 a memorial temple, the Wu Xun Temple in Guan County, Shandong, was created to honor his work. He was portrayed as a Confucian hero and his body was preserved. He continued to be regarded as a hero in Shandong, and the phrase \\"the spirit of Wu Xun\\" was used to refer to the social ideal of progress through education and traditional Confucian ideals of service.  Reaction  In 1950 a film about his work, The Life of Wu Xun, was made. It was quickly criticised by radicals within the Chinese Communist Party for promoting Wu, whose life was attacked as counter-revolutionary. The campaign was the \\"first major politico-ideological campaign in the Chinese Communist regime\\".Henry Yuhuai He, Dictionary of the political thought of the People's Republic of China, M.E. Sharpe, 2001, p. 297. It was initiated by Mao's wife Jiang Qing, who loathed the \\"bourgeois reformism\\" epitomised by Wu. She persuaded Mao himself to write an article denouncing Wu as a promoter of \\"feudal\\" culture.Ross Terrill, Madame Mao: the white boned demon, Stanford University Press, 1999, p.174. The backlash against the film led to an attempt to destroy the cult of Wu. Red Guards exhumed his corpse and carried it to a public square where it was subsequently given a trial and ordered burned. The Red Guards broke the body into pieces before setting light to it with gas.MacFarquhar, Roderick. \\"Red Terror.\\" Mao's Last Revolution. Cambridge: Harvard University. 2006. p. 120. After Mao's death, Wu's reputation was restored. In 1985 the People's Daily stated that the criticisms of Wu \\"cannot be said to be even basically correct\\".

E. Bates and illustrated by Edward Ardizzone. Inspiration Bates's Uncle Silas figure, and many of the lineaments of his character, were based on a real person named Joseph Betts, the husband of H. E. Bates's maternal grandmother's sister Mary Ann. Betts lived in a village in the Ouse Valley, was born in the early 1840s, and lived to the early 1930s. The figure he portrays is Rabelaisian and robust, a true countryman of pithy and roguish character, simultaneously earthy and whimsical, crabbed and wicked, yet full of humour and \\"strong original devilishness.\\" Bates considered that, if anything, he had understated the true English rural character. The delightful stories and scenes were drawn from his own fragrant memories of a Northamptonshire childhood, from stories actually told by his great-uncle, or from a more general country lore of apocryphal legends such as any attentive child might be aware of. The boy (representing the author in childhood) enters into most of the stories, sometimes as a listener and sometimes a participant: his relationship to Silas and the old man's way of putting a slant on his stories for the boy's benefit are essential parts of the whole effect. Publication The first collection of stories (My Uncle Silas) was published in 1939, though the first story (introducing the character), The Lily, was first published separately about six years previously, and had been followed by The Wedding and The Death of Uncle Silas. In a large public correspondence to the author, the British and colonial public demanded the resurrection of Uncle Silas; and so a further 11 stories were written to complete the volume, illustrated by Edward Ardizzone. Various book-club editions and reprints have followed. In 1957 Michael Joseph Ltd of London published a further volume for Bates of 12 additional Uncle Silas stories, accompanied by 25 more Ardizzone drawings, under the title Sugar for the Horse. A single Uncle Silas story, Loss of Pride was published in 1976 in the posthumous collection of Bates' short stories The Yellow Meads of Asphodel. Adaptations Two series of the short stories were adapted for television. The first aired in 2001 and the second in 2003. They featured Albert Finney as Silas. The BBC also produced some radio adaptations.  Sources  *H.E. Bates, 1939, My Uncle Silas (with author's preface: illustrated by Edward Ardizzone). (Jonathan Cape). *H.E.

He served as governor of Tucumán from 1675–1678, governor of Buenos Aires from 1678–1682 and governor of Chile from 1682-1692. In Spain, he was military commander of the garrison at Gibraltar and Captain General of the Basque Country, a charge which he held until his death in 1702. In the colonies, his nickname was \\"El Santo\\" (\\"The Saint\\") for his religious piety. He is most well known for his successful attack on the competing Portuguese settlement at Colonia del Sacramento, constituting the first Spanish capture of the town. Beginning of his military career Garro was born in Mondragón, Guipúzcoa. As a youth, Garro enlisted in the Spanish Army and participated in campaigns in Catalonia and Portugal, until he reached the rank of colonel (maestre de campo, the rank immediately below Captain General) of a tercio. His career in Spain then suffered a setback: according to historian Diego Barros Arana, \\"Due to a violent altercation with a General who had rank of Grandee in Spain, Garro was subjected to the vengeance of a powerful enemy. Preferring instead to live away from the Court, he requested a post in the Indies and obtained the governorship of the province of Tucumán.\\"Diego Barros Arana: \\"A consecuencia de un violento altercado con cierto General, que tenía el rango de grande de España, Garro se vio expuesto a las venganzas de un enemigo poderoso. Prefiriendo por esto mismo vivir lejos de la Corte, solicitó un destino en las Indias y obtuvo el de gobernador de la provincia de Tucumán.\\" In Argentina For four years, from 1675 to 1678, Garro served as governor of the isolated province of Tucumán, dependent to the Real Audiencia de Charcas and part of the Viceroyalty of Peru. During his tenure, he organized three punitive expeditions to Chaco, with no major consequences except the foundation of Fort El Pongo to the east of Jujuy to protect that city. After this, Garro was promoted to become the governor of Buenos Aires, a province of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. =Expulsion of the Portuguese from Uruguay= In 1680, Garro undertook the expulsion of the Portuguese from Colonia del Sacramento, founded in 1679-1680 in present-day Uruguay by Manuel de Lobo, governor of Río de Janeiro. In that campaign, Garro surprised the Portuguese garrison with a militia including 3,000 Guaranían Indians from the Jesuit Reductions. The city was captured after a battle in which 100 of the Portuguese colonial army of 1000 were killed, with the Spanish army taking enemy troops and residents prisoner and seizing Lobo himself, who was later remitted to the custody of Chile. The seizure of Colonia del Sacramento, as it was undertaken without his permission, was disavowed by the king of Spain, and the settlement was returned to Portugal the next year, in 1681, following a provisional treaty made in the expectation of further negotiations including the setting up of a boundary commission, eventually concluding with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Governor of Chile thumb Garro was Royal Governor of Chile in 1682-1692. As Royal Governor of Chile, Garro could not embark on the major campaigns against the Mapuches that he desired, after such a plan was disapproved of by the King of Spain. After earlier Spanish failures, Garro had proposed to the viceroy of Peru, the Duke of La Plata, and the King of Spain that the Mapuche chiefs and elders be invited to a conference where they were to be imprisoned so that Araucanía could be pacified relatively bloodlessly. However, in 1686, King Charles II of Spain rejected the plan as deceitful. He was also unable to dedicate as much time to the frequent legal disputes that arose with the magistrates of the Real Audiencia of Chile, nor to the promotion of the monastic life to which he was especially devoted. Nevertheless, Garro was known for his moral leadership, for which he was known as \\"El Santo\\" (\\"The Saint\\"), particularly in the exile of two audencia judges, Sancho Garcia Salazar and Juan de la Cueva y Lugo, for sinful conduct. Instead, Garro's service was consumed with defeating the expeditions of privateers, which occurred more frequently each month. =Privateers= Garro decreed the depopulation of the Isla Mocha, with the goal of denying resources to pirates who had ravaged the Pacific coast. Notable privateers operating in the area at this time included Englishmen Edward Davis and Charles Swan in 1684, Englishman William Knight in 1686, and Jean Strong in 1690. With the depopulation of the Isla Mocha, the man in charge of the project, Jerónimo de Quiroga, recorded that the local indigenous people: \\"went in baskets of bulrush a distance of 12 leagues all without losing a thing.\\"\\"...pasaron en canastos de totora un golfo de 12 leguas todas (...), sin pérdida ninguna...\\". At the same time, Garro decreed the construction of the Castillo (Castle) San José de Valparaíso, the first fortification of that port town. He also organized novenas and acts of devotion praying that the danger be averted. Return to Spain Garro's actions in America were well received at the Court, and he was given the command of Gibraltar. While there, in 1691, he was fined 4,000 maravedíes for failing throughout his period of office there to order the reforestation of the nearby hills.

Dean Madden was born to a New York City family, and was raised in the Protestant church. He was educated at Yale and New York University and worked both as an instructor and administrator at the latter while he was engaged in business as an accountant; he was also a member of Alpha Kappa Psi professional business fraternity. From 1927–1940, Madden was dean of New York University's business school, serving as a professor through the thirties until 1947, while rendering procurement training to the military in World War II. Dean Madden started an early form of inmate education using his faculty at Sing Sing. Dean Madden is quoted as saying \\"This idea is a mighty fine one, especially at this time. There are many men here who would not have been here five years ago. They committed no strange offenses. They merely carried on the business practices they had been used to. But these practices, with the advent of Depression, became criminal.\\" In 1929, Dean Madden became the third President of Alexander Hamilton Institute, a highly successful distance education business course started by his fellow New York University (NYU) instructor and predecessor as dean.

He stated in his text, \\"Budgetary Control\\" (1930) that it has \\"became apparent that, due to the amount of dollars at stake, purchases are more effectively handled by an individual who could concentrate on the business of procurement. In transforming requests into materials for their organizations, procurement professionals also have to perform market analysis and do product forecasting as well as understand the law of contracts.\\" Dean Madden authored numerous texts of accounting, currency, mortgage banking and other business practices ; accounting historian Julia Grant names him as one of the \\"fathers of modern accounting\\". The educator and business leader was president of Theta Nu Epsilon from 1926–1932, and again (of the splintered TNE) from 1935 to 1946 and was active in the Andiron Club.

The town offers a range of activities, such as the local art gallery (Black Sands Studio), the church, swimming pool, and the newly renovated Birch Park Pool, which is situated on the Taranaki side of Maxwell district. Forest abounds around the Maxwell district. Maxwell beach is a popular attraction as well; many come to see the small waterfall that runs from the farmland to the shore. Maxwell's population in 2013 was 1,644, with females outnumbering males 831 to 813. The local Pākaraka Marae and Te Whānau Pani II and III meeting houses are a traditional meeting place for the Ngā Rauru hapū of Ngāti Maika II.

Its first version was written in 1830 and its last amendment was made in 2004. Uruguay's first constitution was adopted in 1830, following the conclusion of the three-year- long Cisplatine War in which Argentina and Uruguay acted as a regional federation: the United Provinces of Río de la Plata. Sponsored by the United Kingdom, the 1828 Treaty of Montevideo built the foundations for a Uruguayan state and constitution. Attempts to reform the 1830 constitution in 1966 led to the adoption of an entirely new document in 1967. A constitution proposed under a military dictatorship in 1980 was rejected.  Versions  = Original Constitution (1830 - 1918) = The 1830 Constitution of Uruguay coming into force When it became independent on August 25, 1825, the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (República Oriental del Uruguay) drew up its first constitution, which was promulgated on July 18, 1830. This text has been regarded as Uruguay's most technically perfect charter. Heavily influenced by the thinking of the French and American revolutions, it divided the government among the executive, legislative, and judicial powers and established Uruguay as a unitary republic with a centralized form of government. The bicameral General Assembly (Asamblea General) was empowered to elect a president with considerable powers to head the executive branch for a four-year term. The president was given control over all of his ministers of government and was empowered to make decisions with the agreement of at least one of the three ministers recognized by the 1830 constitution. Like all of Uruguay's charters since then, the 1830 constitution provided for a General Assembly composed of a Chamber of Senators (Cámara de Senadores), or Senate (Senado), elected nationally, and a Chamber of Representatives (Cámara de Representantes), elected from the departments. Members of the General Assembly were empowered to pass laws but lacked the authority to dismiss the president or his ministers or to issue votes of no confidence. An 1834 amendment, however, provided for juicio político, or impeachment, of the ministers for \\"unacceptable conduct\\". As established by the 1830 constitution, the Supreme Court of Justice (Suprema Corte de Justicia), and lesser courts, exercised the judicial power. The General Assembly appointed the members of the high court. The latter – with the consent of the Senate in the case of the appellate courts – appointed the members of the lesser courts. The constitution also divided the country into departments, each headed by a governor appointed by the president and each having an advisory body called a Neighbors' Council (Consejo de Vecinos). Although the 1830 constitution remained in effect for eighty-seven years, de facto governments violated it repeatedly. In the 1878-90 period, the Blancos and Colorados initiated the framework for a more stable system through understandings called \\"pacts between the parties.\\" This governing principle, called coparticipation (coparticipación), meaning the sharing of formal political and informal bureaucratic power, has been formally practiced since 1872. The anniversary of the 1830 promulgation of this original constitution on July 18 is now a public holiday in Uruguay. = Second Constitution (1918 - 1934) = In 1913 President José Batlle y Ordóñez (1903–07, 1911–15), the father of modern Uruguay, proposed a constitutional reform involving the creation of a Swiss-style collegial executive system to be called the colegiado. A strong opponent of the one-person, powerful presidency, Batlle y Ordóñez believed that a collective executive power would neutralize the dictatorial intentions of political leaders. It met intense opposition, however, not only from the Blancos but also from members of his own Colorado Party. The proposal was defeated in 1916, but Batlle y Ordóñez worked out a deal with a faction of the Blancos whereby a compromise system was provided for in the second constitution, which was approved by a plebiscite on 25 November 1917. The history of successive constitutions is one of a lengthy struggle between advocates of the collegial system and those of the presidential system. Although the 1917 constitution worked well during the prosperous time after World War I, recurring conflicts between the president and the colegiado members made the executive power ineffective in coping with the economic and social crises wracking the country. These conflicts eventually led to the presidential coup of 1933. The ad hoc government suspended the constitution and appointed a constituent assembly to draw up a new one. = Third Constitution (1934 - 1942) = The 1934 constitution abolished the colegiado and transferred its power to the president. Nevertheless, presidential powers remained somewhat limited. The executive power once again was exercised by a president who had to make decisions together with the ministers. The 1934 charter established the Council of Ministers (Consejo de Ministros) as the body in which these decisions were to be made. This council consisted of the president and the cabinet ministers. The constitution required the chief executive to appoint three of the nine cabinet ministers from among the members of the political party that received the second largest number of votes in the presidential election. The General Assembly, for its part, could issue votes of no confidence in cabinet ministers, with the approval of two-thirds of its members. The constitution divided the Senate between the Blancos and the Colorados or, as political scientist Martin Weinstein has pointed out, between the Herrerist faction of the Blancos (named after Luis Alberto de Herrera) and the Terrist wing of the Colorados (named after Gabriel Terra; president, 1931–38). The party that garnered the second largest number of votes automatically received 50 percent of the Senate seats. In addition, the 1934 charter empowered the Supreme Court of Justice to rule on the constitutionality of the laws. This system, which lasted eighteen years, further limited the power of the president and his government. = Fourth Constitution (1942 - 1951) = Uruguay returned to a more democratic system in 1942. = Fifth Constitution (1951 - 1967) = On 13 July 1951, a formal pact between a fraction of the Colorados and the Herrerist Movement of the Blancos called for a plebiscite on constitutional reform. The plebiscite the following December 16 drew less than half of the 1.1 million voters to the polls, but the collegial system was approved by a small margin. A fourth constitution was promulgated on 25 January 1952 as the culmination of an effort to reestablish the colegiado and the plural executive power, the National Council of Government (Consejo Nacional de Gobierno), with six majority-party seats and three minority-party seats. This nine-member colegiado was ineffective because the president lacked control over the ministers and because the majority was seldom united. In the end, the ineffectiveness of these governments caused the public to turn against the colegiado arrangement. = Sixth Constitution (1967 - 1997) = In the elections of 27 November 1966, nearly 59 percent of Uruguayans voted to amend the 1952 constitution and to reestablish a presidential system of government, thus ending a fifteen-year experiment with the colegiado. The new constitution, which became operative on 15 February 1967, and has remained in effect since then, created a strong one-person presidency, subject to legislative and judicial checks. In free and fair elections, Uruguayans approved the new charter and elected the Colorado Party to power again.  Dictatorial period (1973-1985)  In 1976, however, the military government issued a series of constitutional decrees that amended the 1967 constitution by creating the Council of the Nation (Consejo de la Nación) to serve as the supreme governmental body, with executive and legislative functions. It consisted of the thirty members of the Council of State (Consejo de Estado), the body created by the regime in June 1973 to act in lieu of the General Assembly, which was dissolved by the regime and the twenty-eight senior officers of the armed forces (sixteen from the army, six from the navy, and six from the air force). The Council of the Nation appointed the president of the republic and the members of the Council of State, the Supreme Court of Justice, and the Tribunal of Administrative Claims, which was later dissolved in 1985. Eight institutional acts substituted for many of the functional provisions and guarantees of the 1967 constitution. For example, in addition to giving the Council of the Nation the power to appoint the president of the republic and to set general policy for the country, institutional acts deprived previous officeholders and candidates of their political rights and permitted the arbitrary dismissal of public employees.  Back to institutionality  In 1985, Julio María Sanguinetti was sworn in as the new democratically elected president, after 12 years of dictatorship. The military question was tough to address; after much political bargaining, at the end of December was passed the Expiry Law, which constituted an amnesty of sorts for military people who had committed human-rights abuses. The constitutionality of this law was challenged, but ultimately the citizens backed the law in a plebiscite held in April 1989. = Current (1997 - present) = The 1967 Constitution is still in effect, though it was amended in 1989, 1994, 1996, and 2004. Though some consider the amendments of 1996 to have created a new constitution, Parliament continues to consider them changes to the Constitution of 1967. The most important concepts that changed in 1996 were those related to elections. From 1999 onwards, the election cycle starts in June, with primary elections for all the parties, in order to choose single presidential candidates; in October, general elections are held, if no presidential candidate scores an absolute majority, a second round of voting is held in November; and finally, in May of the following year, municipal elections are held in all the Departments.

It is situated approximately south-west of Goole town centre and lies at both sides but mainly south of the A161 road (Swinefleet Road), covering an area of . It is bordered to the east by the Swinefleet Warping Drain, to the south by the Blackwater Dike, and to the west by the railway line from Goole to Doncaster.Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map, 2006 History Goole Fields is in the north-western sector of the marshes of Hatfield Chase drained by the Netherlands civil engineer Cornelius Vermuyden in 1626–28. Before this diversion of the River Don, the area bore the name of Marshland—still occasionally used—or \\"Merscland\\" in the Domesday Book. The civil parish contains no substantial centre of habitation but consists of a number of farms and a former council estate \\"The Square\\". There are no shops nor a church or even a post box. A phone box can however be found in \\"The Square\\" and there are a total of five street lamps. The only addresses in Goole Fields other than those referred to by farm name are \\"The Barracks\\" (formerly the site of a military barracks) and \\"The Square\\". The only mentionable landmarks in Goole Fields are the windmill and the recently heightened riverbank. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Goole Fields was the location of Goole Equestrian Centre which has since closed. There have been three Caravan Club rallies within Goole Fields (all in the 1990s). In 2004 former Apple Recording artist Brute Force accompanied by the Birmingham group Misty's Big Adventure performed in Goole Fields. The performance consisted of a one-off recital of a song specially penned to celebrate the 30th birthday of the thoroughbred mare \\"Premier Bid\\". The event was covered in the Goole Times. (A recording of the event does exist!) According to the 2011 UK census, Goole Fields parish had a population of 184, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 111. The parish was part of the Goole Rural District in the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1894 to 1974, then in Boothferry district of Humberside until 1996. A wind farm of 17 units: \\"Goole Fields II\\" was constructed in the area between 2012 and 2017. =Buildings= There are several listed buildings within the parish. Goole Hall is situated close to the A161 road, and is a rectangular house built in classical style in the 1820s for Jarvis Empson. It is built of red brick with dressings and chimneys of ashlar sandstone, with two storeys and a basement. It was extended in 1985–6, and is a grade II* listed structure. In the grounds are some grade II listed stables with a coachhouse, built at the same time, although the upper part of the coachhouse was removed and a new roof fitted in the twentieth century. Some to the south is Burying Hill, used as a graveyard for the Empson family who lived at the hall in the early eighteenth century. Although most of the early tombstones are broken, one to Ewan Empson, his two wives and daughter, dated 1728, is not, and is grade II listed. Goole windmill is located to the east of the hall, and was a six-storey tower mill, built in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries. It carries the date 1871, but this is thought to refer to the date on which Thomas Burke became the miller, rather than the date of construction. Only the tower remains, and all machinery has been removed. In addition, the farmhouses at Ash Tree, Field House, Ivy Lodge and Home Farms are all grade II listed. =Peat works= There was formerly a peat works to the north-west of Goole Hall. This was owned by William Smith and Son, who owned another works at Creyke's Siding. Peat was brought to the mill from the moors by a gauge tramway, which ran alongside Earnshaw's Warping Drain and passed just to the east of Goole Grange. The tramway was about long, with a siding into the Grange. Motive power was provided by a steam locomotive, but no further details of the machine have been found. Both of Smith's mills were bought out by the British Peat Moss Litter company, which was formed in 1896 from an amalgamation of the Hatfield Chase Peat Moss Litter Company and several similar operations working on Thorne Moors. The mill continued to operate for only a few years, closing soon after 1902, although peat was stored there until 1914, and the buildings and tracks were not removed for many years afterwards. =Goole Moors= Part of the parish is designated as a site of special scientific interest under the name Thorne Crowle and Goole Moors. The site covers which form the largest lowland raised mire in England although it has been modified by peat cutting. The mire is very important due to its invertebrate fauna with several nationally rare insects, including crickets (Metrioptera brachiptera), moths (Orgyia recens), butterflies (Globiceps woodreftei), and beetles (Bembidion humerale).

Adams, and Gabriel Sunday, who also served as second unit director, additional camera operator, and music editor along with starring in, co-editing, and co-producing the film. It won the best feature film prize for the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival's youth film section Generation 14plus. Music producers Jimmy Iovine and Polly Anthony and actor Harold Ramis served as executive producers, It received a limited theatrical release in the United States on September 23, 2011, and was released to home media on December 6, 2011. Premise Archie is a compulsive and deliberately unsociable 17-year-old. For the final project of his cinematography class, he announces to commit suicide in front of the camera, causing a widespread sensation and, above all, admiration from his peers. Doing so, Archie attracts the attention of his comrades, as well as that of a psychiatrist with a more twisted mind than his own, and, more than anything, the attention of Sierra, the prettiest girl in the school. Cast Co-editor Jordan J. Miller appears as \\"Jordan Jah! The Titty Twistah\\", and co-writer and director David Lee Miller portrays a garbage scrounger. Co-writer Eric J. Adams and executive producer Karen Dean Tritts are credited as background players. I Am an Archie I Am an Archie is a social media marketing campaign aiming to promote teen suicide awareness. After attending an early screening of Archie's Final Project, a Miami teenager created a video in which he identified as an Archie. Since then, thousands of teens have identified themselves as Archies. When asked why the campaign resonated so well with teens, Gabriel Sunday said \\"I think the reason this whole IAmAnArchie campaign started is because kids in the festival circuit would be like, “Oh, that’s me. Archie is me.” There are so many ways you can connect with that character and kids always connect with him, no matter what place or what country they’re in. They feel that sh that he’s going through, and they’re living it. So they started giving that feedback and saying \\"I’m an Archie because I’m depressed and I hate my family, or I’m creative and I love making art but people don’t understand it.\\" I’ve been connected to the issue of suicide for six or seven years, and I know that what kids need to hear more than anything is that they’re not alone. That ended up being our message with IAmAnArchie: “Yeah, I’m scared, I’m depressed, I’m obsessed, I’m whatever, but I’m also an Archie because there’s a million Archies and they’re all going through crazy s*.” Actor/director Adrian Grenier also has identified himself as being an Archie.

According to New Line's website, Misery was the first New Line Home Video release.New Line Cinema : About Us It was responsible for the distribution of all New Line Cinema theatrical films for release on DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The company also distributed some feature films from the specialty studio Picturehouse – formerly a New Line/HBO joint venture – as well as films or non-theatrical programs produced or acquired by New Line Home Entertainment and New Line Television.  History  In May 1991, New Line purchased the home video and foreign rights to films held by Nelson Entertainment (whose library included films inherited from Embassy Pictures) for $15 million, and thus obtained roughly 600 films. Shortly afterwards, New Line acquired the home video rights to the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise from Media Home Entertainment.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- Billboard/90s/1991/BB-1991-05-18.pdf Before New Line formed its own video division, many of the company's films were released on video by various distributors. Initial offerings of New Line product came from MGM/CBS Home Video (now MGM Home Entertainment) (for The Street Fighter and Return of the Street Fighter), Magnetic Video (for Leonor and Sympathy for the Devil, both through Viacom), Wizard Video (for Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble, Sister Street Fighter, and The Street Fighter's Last Revenge), and HBO/Cannon Video (formerly called Thorn EMI Video and Thorn EMI/HBO Video, later called as HBO Video, now — HBO Home Entertainment) (for Xtro, The Evil Dead, The First Time, The Exterminators of the Year 3000, Warriors of the Wasteland, Stunts and Polyester). Later offerings came from RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video and its successor, Columbia TriStar Home Video, Media Home Entertainment (for the first five Nightmare on Elm Street films, and The Hidden among others),http://vhsplatter.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-vhs-index-media-home- entertainment.html and LIVE Entertainment (for Drop Dead Fred, Glengarry Glen Ross and the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film, through Family Home Entertainment). When New Line formed the video division, RCA/Columbia and Columbia TriStar distributed VHS releases, while Image Entertainment released the films on Laserdisc. The New Line-Sony partnership stopped in early 1995, when Turner Broadcasting System bought New Linehttps://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-01-28-fi-16459-story.html and from 1995 to 1996, New Line's video releases were distributed by Turner's video division. One New Line film the company merely distributed, The Swan Princess, was released solely on video on August 3, 1995 by Turner Home Entertainment. After 1996, during the Time Warner ownership, New Line distributed their own films through New Line Home Entertainment. Their Blu- rays and DVDs not only featured advertisement for New Line, but also advertisement for its then sister studio Warner Bros., who advertised special releases from Warner Home Video. The same went for Warner Home Video's Blu- rays and DVDs; New Line Home Entertainment would advertise their special releases on Warner Home Video's Blu-rays and DVDs. On January 5, 2008, New Line Cinema announced, as did its now parent company's own film studio, Warner Bros., that it would exclusively support Blu-ray for their films and drop support of HD DVD. The only New Line Home Entertainment HD DVD ever released was Pan's Labyrinth.New Line Details Transition to Blu-ray  High-Def Digest As New Line had been an autonomously run arm of its parent company, it pursued a policy of regional lockout with its Blu-ray titles.https://forum.blu- ray.com/showthread.php?t=43556 This was in direct contrast to its corporate sibling Warner Home Video which left its Blu-ray titles region-free. With the studio being folded into Warner Bros., Warner has decided to discontinue this lockout policy with future titles. In mid- to late-2008, New Line Home Entertainment then folded into Warner Home Video. The company parted ways with Canadian film distributor Alliance Films. Warner Home Video continues to use the NLHE logo on Blu-ray and DVD releases of titles prior to Valentine's Day (2010 film).

The Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of the game were developed by Amaze Entertainment. The game was first released in North America on October 4, 2007, in Europe on October 12, 2007 and in Australia on October 18, 2007. It is the first game in the Crash Bandicoot series not to have a Japanese release. It was the last game to be published by Vivendi before Activision merged with the company the following year. Crash of the Titans is the fourteenth installment in the Crash Bandicoot video game series, and the sixth game in the main franchise. The game's story centers on the discovery of a substance known as \\"Mojo\\", which series antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and his niece Nina harvest to turn the inhabitants of the Wumpa Islands into an army of ferocious mutants known as \\"Titans\\". The protagonist of the series, Crash Bandicoot, must stop Cortex and Nina by using the technique of \\"jacking\\" to take control of and destroy the Titans while collecting mojo; he must also rescue his sister Coco, who has been kidnapped and forced to help build a doomsday machine that will assist the Titans in Cortex and Nina's bid for world domination. The console versions of Crash of the Titans received mixed reviews upon release, while the DS version generated a favourable response. Although critics generally praised its jacking concept and level of variety, the game's overall execution was deemed to be middling, particularly due to its short length. Despite this reception, the game was nominated for three awards. Gameplay Crash of the Titans is a beat-em-up game with platforming aspects in which the player controls Crash Bandicoot, whose main objective is to rescue his sister, Coco, and save his home, the Wumpa Island, from being destroyed by the main antagonist's gigantic robot. The player's first goal is to rescue the sentient mask Aku Aku, who gives the player basic instructions, shields Crash from enemy attacks, and can be used as a board to help Crash traverse slippery terrain. From there, each level (known as an \\"episode\\") asks players to complete fights against large groups of enemies or simply progress through the episode. Crash starts the game with four lives. The length of each of Crash's lives is tied to his health meter, which decreases whenever Crash is damaged from enemy attacks or falls down a bottomless pit. The player can replenish Crash's health meter by collecting Wumpa Fruit. Each time the health meter is fully depleted, Crash loses a life. However, the player can gain an additional life for Crash by collecting 25,000 units of the magical substance Mojo or by collecting a rare type of Golden Wumpa Fruit. After the last life is lost, the player can continue playing by restarting the current episode. Each episode contains a portal leading to a simple mini-game arena, where the player must accomplish a task in a set time. Generally the task involves collecting a specified quantity of Mojo, jacking a titan and using it's abilities, or simply defeating a select number of enemies. At the end of each episode, the player earns a rank of a bronze, silver, or gold voodoo doll; the rank can be improved by defeating a set number of minions, destroying three robotic toilets or inflicting a minimum number of consecutive hits in combat. All three tasks must be accomplished in an episode if a gold voodoo doll is to be obtained for that episode. Hidden voodoo dolls unlock concept art packages for each episode. The Nintendo DS version of Crash of the Titans contains similar gameplay to that of previous Crash installments. The game takes place on four islands, each with two levels and a boss. When a boss is defeated, a new island is unlocked. Each island has its own \\"Pachinko board\\" where players can win \\"on-demand items\\"; items that can be used to restore health, provide temporary invincibility, and set off Nitro explosions among other things. Additional content can also be won at these Pachinko boards, such as gallery art, cheats and a large quantity of Mojo. =Combat= Crash Bandicoot and \\"Carbon Crash\\" have jacked the Titans Snipe and Spike, respectively Whereas the previous games featured Crash spinning into or jumping on an enemy to attack, Crash of the Titans gives him more options for attack. Early in the game, Crash has a light-powered attack and a heavy-powered attack and can also block, dodge or break an enemy's block. When he defeats an enemy or destroys an object, a magical substance known as Mojo is released. When Crash collects enough Mojo, he will earn either an ability upgrade or a new move, such as the Norris Roundhouse or the Triple Dragon. His classic spin attack, named \\"Old Skool\\", is an unlockable move, along with an aerial variant that allows Crash to float over chasms. While small minions require only a single combo attack for Crash to defeat, larger enemies, known as \\"Titans\\", require more effort to subdue. Each of the fifteen unique Titans in the game possess a star meter that indicates how close they are to being stunned. The meter rises when Crash starts attacking a Titan, and depletes when he stops. When it is full, the Titan is stunned and susceptible to \\"jacking\\", meaning Crash can mount the creature and control it. While controlled by the player, the Titan possesses a similar moveset to Crash, although some jacked Titans can shoot projectiles. Besides greater health, the Titans controlled by Crash have a purple Titan Meter. When this meter is full, players can make the Titan unleash a special attack, which fully drains the meter in the process. A Titan's durability depends on its size; larger Titans will take more effort to defeat than others and a few are immune to Crash's attacks. To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them. On defeating the larger Titan, he can dismount the Titan he previously jacked and directly jack the larger Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed. =Co-operative play= A player using a second controller can join the game at any time in the form of a white-furred version of Crash known as \\"Carbon Crash\\". The second player appears in the first player's backpack, and can usually enter or exit the pack. However, the second player has to stay in the backpack if the first player is in mid-air or climbing a wall. This method of play is useful for overpowering enemies and collecting Mojo faster. There are two modes of co-op play; in \\"Leapfrog Mode\\", the players swap control each time the front player jumps, swings, or slides, while in \\"Piggyback Mode\\", each player is equipped with their own backpack and can hide in the other player's backpack if the action becomes too intense, such as when jumping over a chasm. Plot =Setting= The setting of Crash of the Titans features twenty levels. Each level is referred to as an \\"episode\\", and each has a distinctive subtitle that is usually a punning reference to popular culture (such as \\"The Blizzard of Claws\\"). Like the first Crash Bandicoot game, episodes must be played in order, although the player can replay any episode that has been completed. The game moves through five major themes taking place on Crash's homeland, the Wumpa Islands. The story starts in the jungle near Crash's residence and leads to an ancient temple. Later in the game, Crash travels through a wood-cutting and mining area and a land flowing with lava that features giant steel mosquitoes sucking minerals out of the ground. The next few episodes take place on an artillery-bombarded beach, where Crash infiltrates Doctor N. Gin's missile factory, which resembles the Statue of Liberty. The penultimate area is a gigantic tree located in the middle of the island. This tree holds up an entire house owned by Uka Uka, one of the major antagonists of the series. The final moments of the game take place in the antagonist's Liberace-style lair, and finally inside the Doominator. =Characters= The main cast of Crash of the Titans sporting their new \\"punk\\" look Nine characters from previous Crash Bandicoot titles star in the home console version of Crash of the Titans, all of whom were redesigned with a \\"punk\\" aesthetic that is distinct from other and Japanese video game characters. The protagonist of the game, Crash Bandicoot, is a bandicoot who must defeat the main antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and use the Titans against each other while collecting Mojo to upgrade his fighting techniques. Aiding Crash is Aku Aku, an ancient wooden mask who acts as a shield, a skateboard, and a weapon. He can also help Crash jack Titans. Crash's other two allies are his genius younger sister Coco Bandicoot and his muscular friend, Crunch Bandicoot, who is absent in the Nintendo DS version. Doctor Neo Cortex is a mad scientist who captures Coco and Aku Aku and wants to use stolen Mojo to create an army of mutants. Uka Uka, who is also absent in the Nintendo DS version, is behind Cortex's plot for world domination; after tiring of Cortex's incompetence, Uka replaces him with his cyborg niece, Nina Cortex. Aiding the Cortexes are Doctor N. Gin, who is Cortex's hysterical right-hand man, and Tiny Tiger. Dingodile, another minion of Cortex, exclusively appears in the DS and Game Boy Advance versions of Crash of the Titans as a boss character. Aiding the villains are a number of small fodder enemies that attempt to hinder Crash in his journey. Each fodder is affiliated with a certain villain in the game. The first fodders encountered are Neo Cortex's Ratnicians, which appear as bipedal, chihuahua- like animals dressed as laboratory researchers. These characters appear in the first four episodes of the game, and are replaced by other enemies as the game progresses. The later enemies include Tiny Tiger's Southern-accented Koo-alas, Doctor N. Gin's monkey wrench-wielding Doom Monkeys, Uka Uka's spear-chucking Voodoo Bunnies, and Nina Cortex's Brat Girls. Radical Entertainment sought to give these minor characters personalities by giving them a large number of distinctive quotations. =Story= In the beginning of the game, Crash aids Coco with a butter-recycling device. When Dr. Cortex arrives, not only he captures Aku Aku and Coco, but encases Crunch in ice. Crash throws Coco's machine at Cortex's airship, severing the chain holding Aku Aku's cage, which causes the cage to fall into the nearby forest. After Crash rescues Aku Aku, they discover that Cortex and Uka Uka are stealing Mojo from a nearby temple and decide to stop them. On reaching the temple, Cortex reveals his plot to use the stolen Mojo to create an army of loyal mutants, which will be used to build a robot known as the Doominator, that will crush the Wumpa Islands and take over the world. After failing to defeat Crash with his Yuktopus cyborg, Cortex boasts that Crash will never find his base and flies off, leaving Crash and Aku Aku to follow him. At Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides Cortex for failing to destroy Crash and replaces Cortex with his niece, Nina Cortex, despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger. Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her participate in the construction of the Doominator. Throughout the course of the game, Crash and Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger, Doctor N. Gin and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco. When they confront Nina inside the Doominator robot, she summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights Crash. Crash eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), sparing much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from the collapsed Doominator, Cortex praises Nina for betraying him, and promises to be more evil in the near future. The Bandicoots decide that it is time for celebration, leading Crash to shout his first word in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes. The DS version of the game largely follows the story of the home console versions, but with minor alterations such as Nina Cortex having a greater role and the inclusion of Dingodile. Near the end of the game, Nina teams up with Crash to stop Doctor Cortex and his dancing \\"CortexBot\\". The Game Boy Advance version also includes Dingodile, some plot differences, such as the Arachnina (referred to by its old name, \\"Spiderbot\\") not being the last boss, and Cortex being reinstated after Nina's defeat in the N. Trapment Island. Development Development on Crash of the Titans began after the completion of Crash Tag Team Racing. The graphics of the Wii version of the game was one of Radical Entertainment's main focuses in the game's development, with Radical stating that the Wii has \\"a lot of horsepower under the hood\\" and expressing their desire to make full use of it. They also considered implementing a feature to connect the Wii to DS during gameplay, but stopped due to technical issues and time. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 version got a few extra months of development time to improve its graphics before setting a final release date. While the game was being developed, the title's main character, Crash Bandicoot, became the new mascot of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's \\"School and Youth\\" programs in an effort to promote the battle against blood cancer. In a bid to further promote the game, a Hummer (with a Wii inside) was painted with imagery from the game and displayed at the Annual Balloon Fiesta in Bristol, United Kingdom. A \\"Monster Edition\\" of the game was released exclusively in Europe on October 12, 2007 for the PlayStation 2. This special edition of the game features \\"Making-of\\" videos, water-on tattoos, game hints, a cheat code list, and the game's E3 and theatrical trailers in multiple languages. Due to its \\"mild cartoon violence and language\\", the game received a PG rating from the BBFC. =Music= Unlike Crash Tag Team Racing, Radical did not hire the composer of the music in the previous Crash games, the a cappella band Spiralmouth whose members Rebecca Kneubuhl and Gabriel Mann left to compose musical pieces to The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night and The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon from Crash's companion franchise Spyro the Dragon, to write the music for Crash of the Titans. Instead, they assigned the job to their in-house composer Marc Baril, who took Spiralmouth's work on the previous games as references for Crash of the Titans. Radical Entertainment has expressed its pride with some of the music featured in the game, such as Doctor N. Gin's polka theme. A 32-track soundtrack was made available on the iTunes Music Store on December 18, 2007. The music in the Nintendo DS version of the game was created by Nathaniel Papadakis. =Voice cast= To avoid repetitive audio, Crash of the Titans features more than 7,000 lines of dialogue, many of which contain references to popular culture, such as the film Brokeback Mountain. To achieve a natural feel for their dialogue, the voice actors performed all their lines three times. Many of the voice actors from Crash Tag Team Racing reprised their roles, including Jess Harnell as Crash Bandicoot and Lex Lang as Doctor Neo Cortex. Characters who were regulars in the series but did not appear in Crash Tag Team Racing were given new voice actors for Crash of the Titans. These replacements include Greg Eagles as Aku Aku, Chris Williams as Tiny Tiger, and John DiMaggio as Uka Uka. The DS version features full voice acting for cutscenes and in-game elements by some of the same voice actors from the home console version of the game, though some of the voice actors were substituted, such as Debi Derryberry in the role of Coco Bandicoot, and Nolan North in the role of N. Gin. Dingodile, who appears only in the DS and GBA versions, is voiced by Nolan North. To make enemies memorable on their own; Radical Entertainment scripted conversations between the enemy characters that can be overheard as the player approaches. Several voice actors provide the audio for the small enemies, including Tom Kenny from Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants. Adding to the game's numerous pop-culture references, the voices and mannerisms of some of the characters are based upon those of real people, including Mike Tyson, Mr. T, Jerry Lewis, and Peter Lorre. Reception Crash of the Titans received mixed to average reviews upon its release, except for the DS version, which received positive reviews. GameSpot credited it as a \\"fairly sturdy, combat-heavy platformer with a good hook\\", but concluded that it lacked the distinctive style of past Crash Bandicoot games. The DS version of the game was reviewed positively, with IGN naming it \\"one of the better handheld Crash games to hit the market\\". Nintendo World Report gave the DS version a higher score than the home console version by half a point, but dismissed it as \\"a short game that has very little gameplay variety\\". GameSpot proclaimed that \\"there's plenty to do, and controlling the enemy is a neat twist\\", but criticized the game's small length of only six to eight hours. The more negative reviews include those from Nintendo Power, who criticized the game for its \\"fixed and unforgiving\\" camera, which they felt made the platforming experience \\"frustrating\\". GameSpy also criticized the game for its camera along with its unsteady framerate, but praised the game's attractive graphics and offline co-op mode. IGN described the game as \\"a good idea wrapped in a mediocre game\\", dismissing the game's music as \\"forgettable\\", and hoping that the jacking concept would be refined for a possible sequel. Eurogamer was also critical of Crash of the Titans, deriding its graphics as \\"designed primarily with the PS2 and Wii in mind, with a fairly lazy high-def makeover late in development\\". The PSP version received less praise than its console counterparts, with IGN remarking that it \\"loses out to the consoles in a number of areas; especially when it comes to multiplayer\\". Crash of the Titans was a nominee in the Writers Guild of America's inaugural video game writing awards, competing against Dead Head Fred, The Simpsons Game, The Witcher and World in Conflict; Dead Head Fred won the award. Crash of the Titans was also selected as a nominee in the \\"Best Sound Design\\" and \\"Best Character\\" categories of the Second Annual Elan Awards. It lost both awards to Skate and Mass Effect's Commander Shepard respectively. In Australia, Crash of the Titans was the second highest-selling game in its first week below Halo 3. The game was not as successful in the United Kingdom, where the PS2 version of the game debuted at #32 in the sales charts. The game made £3.35 million in the UK, by the end of 2007. Despite the poor sales in the UK, the game was re- released on Platinum for the PlayStation and for the Xbox 360 Classics.

History The North Bend school district awarded its first four-year diplomas in the spring of 1908, the first high school in Coos County, Oregon, to do so. The school was operating out of the Central School building at that time. Even prior to that, in the fall of 1907, the school colors of brown and gold were chosen for the school. The superintendent at the time, A.G. Rabb, had graduated from Baldwin College in Ohio, which had those same colors. Raab also instituted a tradition of annually tying a ribbon with the name of each year's graduates to a shovel used to plant a sprig of ivy or a tree to beautify the schools campus.Coos Bay Harbor (North Bend), January 29, 1926> By the 1909-1910 school year a new building, Kinney High, was built to provide a place of higher education in North Bend, Oregon. Only one student graduated from Kinney High in 1910. A year later the school was renamed North Bend High School when it was discovered that the man who donated the property for the school, Lorenzo D. Kinney, did not have clear title to the land. In 1928, the high school's letterman club (Order of North Bend) suggested a Bulldog mascot for the school. It was first mentioned in the local newspapers in the fall. It remains the school's mascot.Coos Bay Harbor (North Bend), February 17, 1928 and October 19, 1928> In May of 2018 a story popped up regarding North Bend High School that got national coverage. Two LGBT students accused the district of discrimination against their sexual orientation, and claimed that they had been harassed and assaulted by other students, including the principal's own son. Bill Lucero, the principal of the high school, has been reassigned to the middle school due to a legally binding contract signed by the Oregon Department of Education and the District.http://www.ktvz.com/news/north-bend- hs-faces-anti-gay-discrimination-hearing/744529651 Academics In 1987, North Bend High School was honored in the Blue Ribbon Schools Program, the highest honor a school can receive in the United States. In 2008, 78% of the school's seniors received their high school diploma. Of 198 students, 154 graduated, 28 dropped out, 3 received a modified diploma, and 13 are still in high school.

PCHL/NWHL era (1928–1941) The first incarnation of Portland Buckaroos played their home games at the Portland Ice Arena. The Buckaroos initially played in the four-team Pacific Coast Hockey League (PCHL) from 1928 to 1931. The PCHL folded in 1931, and in 1933, the Buckaroos joined the new North West Hockey League. In 1936, the Buckaroos rejoined the reconstituted four-team PCHL, and won league championships in 1937 and 1939. With the onset of World War II, the PCHL folded again in 1941. In 1944, it was again resurrected, but this time, Portland's team was the Portland Eagles (known as the Portland Penguins for one season). WHL/WIHL era (1960–1975) In 1960, Portland was granted a franchise in the minor league Western Hockey League (WHL) for its newly built 10,500 seat Memorial Coliseum, and the Buckaroos name was reincarnated. The new Buckaroos were composed mostly of players and coaches from the New Westminster Royals, including its head coach Hal Laycoe. The Buckaroos went on to beat the Seattle Totems in the league championship and win the Lester Patrick Cup in its first season of existence. That 1960–61 Buckaroos team was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1990. The Buckaroos won another league championship under Laycoe in 1964–65, and a third in 1970–71 under coach and former team captain Gord Fashoway. In the early '70s, the Buckaroos served as a minor league affiliate for a variety of National Hockey League teams, most notably the Los Angeles Kings. In 1974, the WHL folded and the Buckaroos moved to the semi-pro Western International Hockey League for the 1974–75 season, and to the startup Northwest Hockey League the next year,http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/159.html but that league did not last a full season.

In the late 17th century, during his search for a corrosion-resistant coating for iron, he developed a recipe that included asphaltum, linseed oil and burnt umber. Once applied to metal and heated the coating turned black and was extremely tough and durable. Pontypool is in a steep valley in South Wales, surrounded by coal and iron working. The iron used was produced by the furnaces of Blaenavon to the North, and most of the \\"Pontypool ware\\" was actually produced in nearby Usk or Newport, at the Southern end of the valley. Background In the late 17th century, there was a developing trade in metal goods made of thin iron sheet, spurred by development of the rolling mill. Rustproofing this iron was important. Tin plating had been developed in Germany, and British manufacturers needed to compete. While it was the growth of the iron foundries and tin plating that gave birth to japanning on metal, tin plated iron was not the only metal used. There are examples of brass, copper and bronze used as substrates. In France copper was the metal primarily used. Because it had to be hammered into shape rather than rolled and stamped the surface was uneven. This did not provide the best surface for japanning thus it has a greater tendency to flake off than the smoother English tinware. When the French made tinware it was often trimmed with bronze. The use of metal allowed a variety of forms that were required to withstand heat and water. Coffee pots, tea sets, candle sticks and other household items could all be japanned and decorated in the popular fashion. These japanned metal objects are very stable so a great many still survive. Many pieces survive today with little rust. In most cases it is easy to ascertain the underlying metal because it can be seen in losses or scratches. If the japanning is intact, a magnet can be used to identify iron. Most iron trays show some rust on the back where only a single coating was applied. Even the tin plated iron objects show rust in some areas. It is worth remembering the unavailability of effective paint, at this time. The surface finishes that did exist either had poor adhesion to their substrate, or required either a porous or an organic substrate to bond to. Today's resin-based paints for metals had not been invented. Recipes Similar recipes or \\"secret varnishes\\" were also used in Birmingham. In his book on Pontypool japan (W. D. John, 1953), published one of the recipes the workmen had handed down through generations: * 448 pounds of raw linseed oil * 22 pounds of lump umber * 20 pounds of flake litharge * 100 pounds of asphaltum * 5 pounds of cobalt resinate * 406 pounds of white spirit or turpentine The linseed oil was heated together with the umber and the asphaltum while the litharge and cobalt were added slowly. According to the recipe, the varnish was ready when a drop of varnish dripped onto cold glass remained in a ball. After cooling, the turpentine was added. There was also a pale clear version which omitted the asphaltum and the cobalt. In modern tests, this varnish worked equally well on papier mâché and metal plates. Three coats produced a durable glossy black finish. This recipe is similar to one for gold size published by both (Robert Dossie, 1764) and (Stalker and Parker, 1688). In that version, linseed oil is boiled together with gum animi, asphaltum, litharge and umber in approximately the same proportions as the Pontypool recipe. (Watin, 1755) also describes the use of asphaltum as an addition to the well-known spirit varnishes of the day. It appears that the secret recipe for Pontypool japan had been in existence for some time before its use for japanning metal.

Legal marketing is a broader term referring to advertising and other practices, such as client relations, blogging, cross-selling, public relations and maintaining contact with alumni. Australia In Australia, legal advertising is regulated by the Legal Services Commission of the State they practice in. Generally, Australian lawyers must ensure their advertising isn't false, misleading or deceptive, offensive or prohibited by law.https://www.qls.com.au/Knowledge_centre/Ethics/Resources/Advertising England and Wales Legal marketing has been permitted in England and Wales since 1986, when the Law Society of England and Wales first permitted lawyers to advertise. The Financial Services Authority now licences helplines and claims management agencies - except trade unions - which typically advertise and refer claims to lawyers. European Union From the 1990s, other jurisdictions in continental Europe progressively opened way for advertising. Advocates in Spain and France are among those able to freely use instruments of communication. Germany In Germany, prior to 1990, it was considered professionally improper to market your law firm. Because of the opinion that the law was above advertisement, the use of a logo anywhere was forbidden, and something as innocuous as a telephone book listing was subject to scrutiny. It was forbidden to give any sort of detailed information on your firm’s practice areas or specializations anywhere, even in yellow page listings. Only the name of the firm, physical address, and telephone numbers were allowed. Law firms began to question the fairness of this prohibition in their profession. In the 1990/1991 annual issue of the yellow pages for Nürnberg-Fürth, published by Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, the listing Dr Kreuzer & Coll, Nürnberg, Germany, broke with the status quo. The listing included not only the address, telephone, fax and telex numbers for the firm, but also the names of the founder of the firm, Dr. Günther Kreuzer, his partner Felix Müller, and the names of two of their attorneys as well as all of their specializations or areas of focus; Fachanwalt für Sozialrecht (Specialist for Civil Law), Fachanwalt für Arbeitsrecht (Specialist for Employment Law), Rechtsanwältin für Verkehrssachen (Lawyer for Traffic Law) and Rechtsanwalt für Familiensachen (Lawyer for Family Law). As soon as that edition was published, there was an objection filed by a fellow member of the bar. They complained that Dr Kreuzer & Coll had broken the code of professionalism and asked for a disciplinary hearing, stating a severe breach of professional etiquette.CaseSummary ;Final ruling The disciplinary court, an appellant court and ultimately, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany's Senate for Law Matters returned a decision in favor of the defendants and ruled that no breach of professional etiquette had transpired as the information that was posted was true and that there was no reason that firms should not be able to give such detailed information in their listings. India In India, an advocate shall not solicit work or advertise, except through a medium maintained by the Bar Council of India, either directly or indirectly, whether by circulars, advertisements, touts, personal communications, interviews not warranted by personal relations, furnishing or inspiring newspaper comments or producing his/her photographs to be published in connection with cases in which they have been engaged or concerned. Their sign-board or name-plate should be of a reasonable size. The sign-board or name-plate or stationery should not indicate that they are or have been a president or member of a bar council or of any association or that they have been associated with any person or organization or with any particular cause or matter or that they specialize in any particular type of work or that they had been a judge or an advocate general. Soliciting work or advertise as used in this clause of the code would not mean and include setting up of a web-site by an advocate or a law firm giving only basic information about the names and number of lawyers in a law firm, the contact details and areas of practice. This similarly applies to lawyers’ brochures and law directories. Under the amended rule, advocates can mention in their chosen websites, their names, telephone numbers, e-mail ID, professional qualification and areas of specialization. Israel In Israel, legal marketing managers in big law firms were active since 2006. Their activity expanded due to the late-2000s recession which affected law firms, and due to the large number of lawyers per capita in Israel. Italy In Italy, the Bersani Decree of July 2, converted into law in January 2007 gives lawyers the right to advertise. United States Lawyer advertising in the United States is legal, although subject to ethical rules promulgated by state bar associations. Commonly encountered forms of lawyer advertising include television and radio commercials, print advertisements, billboards, direct mail marketing, law firm websites, and participation in telephone directories, commercial directories and referral services, and through online advertising and social media. In 1908, the American Bar Association (\\"ABA\\") established its first ethics code, known as the Canons of Professional Ethics, which condemned all advertisement and solicitation by lawyers. Due to the progression of the legal profession and the desire to update the Canons of Professional Ethics, the ABA created the Model Code of Professional Responsibility (\\"Model Code\\") in 1969. The Model Code was an effort by the ABA to create practical rules that went \\"beyond the pretty details of form and manners\\" and addressed \\"the chained relationship of the lawyer to his clients, to his professional brethren and to the public.\\"Olson, Emily, \\"Ethics of Attorney Advertising: The Effects of Different State Regulatory Regimes, The\\" Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics, The (2005) http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/geojlege18÷=57&id;=&page;= The first major case law decision on legal advertising is the Supreme Court ruling in Bates v.

It has been used as the default \\"wastebin taxon\\" for Pseudocrenilabrinae cichlids of the East African Rift, and as such became the \\"largest\\" fish \\"genus\\". Many of these cichlids are popular aquarium fishes; like similar Haplochromini they are known as \\"haplos\\", \\"happies\\" or \\"haps\\" among aquarium enthusiasts.Linke & Staeck (1994) The genus was established by F.M. Hilgendorf in 1888. It was originally conceived as a subgenus of A.C.L.G. Günther's \\"Chromis\\", at that time an even larger \\"wastebin genus\\" for Pseudocrenilabrinae cichlids. The type species of Hilgendorf was H. obliquidens. \\"Chromis\\" of Günther turned out to be a junior homonym of G. Cuvier's ocean fish genus Chromis, already established in 1814, and was abolished. As the years went by, other genera of (mostly) Haplochromini were lumped with and split again from Haplochromis, and the final delimitation of the clade around H. obliquidens is not yet done. Extinction crisis in Lake Victoria The introduction of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) to Lake Victoria after 1954 severely upset the lake's ecosystem. By the late 1970s, the perch's population was approaching carrying capacity, and the smaller cichlids were fair game for the huge carnivorous Lates, the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), an adaptable generalist, was also introduced and competed with the often specialized endemic cichlids of the lake for food and other resources. When the Nile perch stocks finally declined again in the late 1980s, an estimated 200 Haplochromini species (mostly Haplochromis) may have become extinct – many of these had only been scientifically described a few years before their demise, and additional ones were only known or suspected to exist, but never properly studied or described.Linke & Staeck (1994), Kishe-Machumu et al. (2008), IUCN (2009) While the stocks of those species that survived are in many cases recovering, the lake ecosystem has changed irrevocably. The entire trophic web has been observed to be upset. But still, evolution runs its course: those Lake Victoria Haplochromis species that still exist are in many cases adapting to new food sources, and in time, speciation is likely to set in and produce a new adaptive radiation of these fishes. Until then, however, the ecological balance of the lake is still on the brink, and many of the cichlids that survived the peak population of Lates are still critically endangered and close to extinction.Kishe-Machumu et al. (2008), IUCN (2009) Systematics and taxonomy Haplochromis is the type genus of the tribe Haplochromini. Most of the tribe's members were at one time or another included in the present genus, but in many cases this was only temporary. Around the year 1900, as well 100 years later, the trend was to split up the genus; especially in the mid-20th century, on the other hand, most authors lumped any and all Haplochromini that were not conspicuously distinct in the type genus.FishBase [2009b] While a number of African Rift Valley cichlids are certainly very close relatives of H. obliquidens, the type species of the present genus, it is not very clear where to draw the boundary of Haplochromis with regard to its relatives. Still, several genera are now recognized as distinct by many authors and scientific databases, such as FishBase (see below); in particular the Haplochromini from Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi are usually removed from Haplochromis. The genus delimitation in the entire tribe remains badly resolved, however, and further changes in taxonomy are likely in the future. In particular, between Haplochromis, Astatotilapia and Thoracochromis, species have been moved to and from over the years. The habit of Pseudocrenilabrinae to hybridize is hampering molecular phylogenetic studies based on mtDNA alone, while trophic morphs of a single species may appear to be distinct \\"species\\" if they are not phylogenetically studied. Several proposed genera are again included in Haplochromis at present, but it cannot be ruled out that some of these will eventually be recognized as valid again.Nagl et al.

A number of them are likely to represent undescribed distinct species; others might just be subspecies or color morphs. Whether they all belong in Haplochromis is, of course, doubtful. Some of these populations are: * Haplochromis aff. bloyeti * Haplochromis sp. '75' * Haplochromis sp. 'Amboseli' * Haplochromis sp. 'backflash cryptodon' * Haplochromis sp. 'black cryptodon' * Haplochromis sp. 'Chala' * Haplochromis sp. 'dusky wine-red fin' * Haplochromis sp. 'frogmouth' * Haplochromis sp. 'Kyoga flameback' * Haplochromis sp.

'small obesoid' =Formerly in Haplochromis= Adult male Golden Mbuna (Melanochromis auratus) Giraffe Hap (Nimbochromis venustus) Adult male Sciaenochromis fryeri Among other genera of Haplochromini that were formerly included here, many are small or monotypic. The distinctness of these is highly doubtful, as they may just be distinct lineages of Haplochromis or other haplochromines. That nonwithstanding, Haplochromini genera to which some former \\"Haplochromis\\" have been removed are in particular:Linke & Staeck (1994), FishBase [2009b] * Astatoreochromis (3 species) * Astatotilapia (8 described species) * Aulonocara (22 species) * Buccochromis (7 species) * Caprichromis (2 species) * Champsochromis (2 species) * Cheilochromis (monotypic) * Chetia (6 species) * Copadichromis (25 described species) * Ctenochromis (5 living and 1 extinct described species) * Ctenopharynx (3 species) * Cyrtocara (monotypic) * Dimidiochromis (4 species) * Eclectochromis (2 species) * Fossorochromis (monotypic) * Hemitaeniochromis (monotypic) * Lethrinops (24 species) * Maylandia/Metriaclima (25 species) * Mchenga (6 species) * Melanochromis (27 species) * Mylochromis (21 species) * Naevochromis (monotypic) * Nimbochromis (5 species) * Nyassachromis (8 species) * Orthochromis (14 species) * Otopharynx (13 species) * Pharyngochromis (2 species) * Placidochromis (43 species) * Protomelas (15 species) * Pundamilia (4 species) * Pseudocrenilabrus (3 species) * Sargochromis (8 species) * Schwetzochromis (monotypic) * Sciaenochromis (4 species) * Stigmatochromis (4 species) * Taeniochromis (monotypic) * Taeniolethrinops (4 species) * Thoracochromis (12 species) * Tramitichromis (5 species) * Trematocranus (3 species) * Tyrannochromis (4 species) Some other Pseudocrenilabrinae were also – mainly by early authors – included in Haplochromis, though they are not members of its tribe. These are: * Anomalochromis thomasi of the Hemichromini * Altolamprologus compressiceps of the Lamprologini * Tilapia jallae of the Tilapiini =Synonyms of Haplochromis= With all the taxonomic and systematic confusion affecting Haplochromis and its allies, it is hardly surprising that the genus has a large number of junior synonyms. Most referred to small or monotypic genera that were once considered distinct, but are now included in Haplochromis again, if only to wait for a major review of their status. Synonyms are: * Allochromis Greenwood, 1980 * Cleptochromis Greenwood, 1980 * Enterochromis Greenwood, 1980 * Gaurochromis Greenwood, 1980 * Harpagochromis Greenwood, 1980 * Labrochromis Regan, 1920 * Lipochromis Regan, 1920 * Platytaeniodus Boulenger, 1906 * Prognathochromis Greenwood, 1980 * Ptyochromis Greenwood, 1980 * Psammochromis Greenwood, 1980 * Tridontochromis Greenwood, 1980 * Xystichromis Greenwood, 1980 * Yssichromis Greenwood, 1980 Sometimes other genera listed above are also synonymized.

Retrieved February 17, 2018. is the CEO of Fender Musical Instruments Corporation and former chairman of Disney Consumer Products (DCP). Mooney joined the Walt Disney Company as president of DCP in December 1999 and was promoted to chairman in May 2003. Vertical businesses under Mooney's leadership and the DCP umbrella were The Baby Einstein Company, Disney Publishing Worldwide and newly re-acquired retail chain The Disney Store. He is credited with pioneering the $45 billion Disney Princess franchise. Early life Andy Mooney is a native of Whitburn, Scotland, United Kingdom. He holds an Accounting Certificate in the UK. He played the electric guitar in various bands during and after high school in hopes of becoming a professional musician. He was a semi-professional musician through his 20s until he moved to the United States from the UK. Career Prior to Disney, Mooney spent 20 years with Nike, Inc. Originally joining Nike's United Kingdom division as chief financial officer, he transitioned to marketing in 1982, holding several senior positions before becoming chief marketing officer for Nike in the United States in 1994. Immediately prior to joining DCP, Mooney was chief marketing officer and head of Nike's $3 billion Global Apparel organization with additional responsibilities for worldwide marketing strategies for the Nike and Jordan brands. He led the reorganization of Nike's brand marketing activities and introduced new advertising strategies. In 2000, Mooney, having recently been made chairman of Disney Consumer Products Worldwide, went to see a Disney on Ice show in Phoenix, Arizona, where he saw little girls dressed as princesses, wearing handmade gowns with mismatched jewelry. Though he noted the deep affection for the characters with which these outfits were made, he imagined that ones assembled professionally by Disney could be lucrative. He packaged the Disney Princesses under a single brand, which sold items such as a yellow organza Belle costume, Sleeping Beauty pajamas and matching accessories. As of 2011, the franchise is a $4 billion-a-year brand featuring 26,000 products.McClellan, Jennifer (April 5, 2011). \\"4/7-10: Disney on Ice 'Princess Classics' in Phoenix\\". The Arizona Republic. In early 2001, his executive assistant, Pamela, brought him an idea of creating a line of wedding dresses inspired by the Disney Princesses. Giving the go-ahead, Pamela approached Vera Wang for the opportunity to design the gowns. Ms. Wang declined the opportunity, which resulted in Mooney pulling together a group of Disney creative people. Under Mooney's leadership this team, the Disney Global Creative team created he Disney Fairy Tale Weddings line. The wedding dresses are inspired by the princess characters, and they later were designed by Kirstie Kelly. Mooney announced his resignation from Disney on September 6, 2011 to pursue interests with other companies. In March 2012, Mooney joined the Board of shopkick, the mobile shopping application, along with Kleiner Perkins and Reid Hoffman. In January 2013, Quiksilver announced that Mooney would be its new President and Chief Executive Officer, replacing Bob McKnight. On March 27, 2015, Quiksilver announced the termination of Mooney as CEO of the company. He was replaced as CEO by Pierre Agnes, who had worked at Quiksilver for 27 years and was promoted to president in November 2014. On June 2, 2015, Mooney was appointed CEO of Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, replacing Scott Gilbertson.

Most of the town competitions were held in customized trailers outside of department stores. It was based on scoring points in a special Game Pak. The three Super Nintendo Entertainment System games (Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, Super Mario Kart, and Ken Griffey, Jr. Presents Major League Baseball) were played within a time limit of six minutes. Games The tasks on the games are as follows: # Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels: Players must complete the first level as quickly as possible. # Super Mario Kart: Players must finish the first track of five laps. # Ken Griffey, Jr. Presents Major League Baseball: Players must play a home run derby and hit as many home runs as possible. After the time expires, the final score is calculated like this: Score from Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels+ ((Coins collected in Super Mario Kart x 1,000) + Finishing position score)+ ((Total distance in Major League Baseball x 100) + (Number of home runs x 10,000 in the regional events or 1,000,000 in the Finals)) = Grand Total City competitions Local competitions took place over three days with the finals happening late Sunday afternoon. Eight finalists were chosen from the top eight scores achieved during the weekend. Top Eight First round occurred in two parts because four people could play at a time. The players who had the top four scores played first followed by lower four scorers. Top Four and Top Two The top four scores from the Top Eight round played and from that the Top Two played head-to-head for the Town Title. The winner was crowned Town Champion. World finals The Nintendo World Championships II held their finals in San Diego, California. Town Champions were grouped into four teams: # Cyclones # Hurricanes # Tornados # Typhoons The Tornados scored the highest at the World Championships in San Diego, California. Results The final two players were Mike Iarossi and Brandon Veach on the Tornados team and played head to head on a specialized cartridge of Donkey Kong Country. Mike Iarossi had the highest score and was crowned the 1994 Nintendo World Champion. Cartridge Nintendo PowerFest '94 Cartridge connected to SNES Nintendo produced around 33 cartridges for the PowerFest '94. These were used in stores across the country in 1994 for around 130 different events. The winners of each event won a trip to San Diego, CA to play in the World Championships. The second-place winner at each event got a Star Fox Jacket, which had been left over from the Star Fox Competition the year before. Out of the 33 cartridges, only two exist today. The rest were returned to Nintendo where they were reused for parts. The remaining cartridge was supposedly put up for auction on myebid with a buy it now price of $300,000; there were no bidders. A second cartridge was uncovered and a collector, J. J. Hendricks, purchased it for $12,000.

The company was created in 1987 in order to improve shipbuilding productivity by combining the Wärtsilä and Valmet yards under the same organisation. The yards were located in Helsinki and Turku. The company fell in a scandalous bankruptcy in 1989. The operation was continued after under name Masa-Yards.  Background  During the 1970s and 1980s the European shipbuilding suffered of a too high capacity and unhealthy competition. The Asian shipbuilders had grown fast and taken over a large part of the market. Combination of increasing salary costs and price dumping lead to an untenable situation for many European shipbuilders. Swedish shipbuilders had faced difficulties already in the 1970s and the yards had been kept alive through massive subsidies.Knorring: Telakkajätti ja telakkakriisi. p. 135–139. Due to Soviet exports, the Finnish shipbuilders were working in a fairly good level until the 1980s. The five- year-plan of 1981–1985 guaranteed the vital basic load for the Finnish yards, but the plan of 1986–1990 meant the end of the golden era for the Soviet export. The Soviets negotiated very low prices for the few ships included in the plan, and the ordered quantity remained even much lower. The ships made for Soviet Union had been included in the bilateral agreement between the two countries and it was getting out of balance, as the Soviet export to Finland reduced drastically. In order to maintain the employment in its shipyards the Finnish government decided to deliver the ships to Soviet Union for credit.  Foundation of Wärtsilä Marine  In 1986 the two main shipbuilders of Finland, Wärtsilä and Valmet, agreed about putting together their shipbuilding business units and close the least competitive ones, which meant the Valmet yards. As a part of the reorganisation Wärtsilä separated its diesel engine building operations in Turku and Vaasa from the shipbuilding organisation to a separate business unit, Wärtsilä Diesel Oy. The ownership of the new shipbuilding company was shared so that 30% went for Valmet and 70% for Wärtsilä. Wärtsilä's paper machine industry was moved to Valmet as a payment. At the beginning the state gave a FIM 700 million tax relief. The number of employees had been gradually reduced by the 1980s. The Perno shipyard in Turku offered an early retirement for personnel of aged 56 years and over. The new company was started officially at the beginning of 1987. The name of the company was Wärtsilä Meriteollisuus Oy in Finnish, Wärtsilä Marinindustri Ab in Swedish and internationally was used name Wärtsilä Marine. The manager was Pekka Laine.Knorring: Wärtsilä Marinen tarina. p. 140–146. Martin Saarikangas, the manager of Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard, was against the merger; he did not believe in the future of the Soviet trade and Saarikangas had worked hard to get projects from west in order to reduce Wärtsilä's dependency on Soviet exports. Only about 25% of Wärtsilä's sales went to Soviet Union, whereas Valmet yards were virtually entirely dependent on Soviet exports. Instead of merger, Saarikangas suggested reorganising of Wärtsilä yards to be able to cope in the market. But the top management, however, did not share Saarikangas's views, and despite being appointed the Vice President of Wärtsilä Marine, he was relocated to United States.  New orders  At very first Laine made a new agreement with the Soviet Sudoimport about moving partly of a project with nine ships from Valmet yards to Wärtsilä Perno shipyard. Two of the ships were started at Valmet Laivateollisuus yard in Turku and one at Vuosaari shipyard in Helsinki; the yards were planned to be closed after handing over of the ships. Wärtsilä Marine got an order of cruise ship from Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL). The contract included an option for two sister ships and the ships were planned to be built in Wärtsilä Helsinki yard. Still in January, Marine got another order from Norwegian company Kloster Cruise A/S for a cruise ship; the delivery was scheduled for November 1988. In the following month the Swedish Rederi Ab Slite ordered a cruiseferry for route between Finland and Sweden; also this contract included an option for a sister ship, which was signed in the following July. Also CCL used its option for the two additional cruiseferries in the following September. A new order followed in October, when Effoa ordered a cruise ferry for Helsinki – Stockholm -route, including an option for a sister ship, which was ordered in March 1988.  Weaknesses  The suddenly grown order book put Wärtsilä Marine at the front of new challenges, and the company's structural weaknesses came out. The capital of the company was FIM 1.5 billion in total. The share of Wärtsilä was FIM 1.05 billion and Valmet held FIM 450 million. However, the capital consisted 90% of fixed property, such as the real estate and equipment, and just FIM 150 million in cash. The second problem came from Soviet-ordered ships which were inherited from Valmet; the calculations showed in 1987 that these ships would cause losses of FIM 200–400 million. This was partly explained by mistakes in calculations, but partly also a conscious choice made in name of employment. The third problem came from the cruise ships ordered by CCL; it turned out that also their construction costs were calculated wrong. It is not known if the reason was a consciously miscalculation, or were the costs of the demanding ships underestimated. The state had guaranteed the projects up to FIM 600 million of losses. However, it is notable that CCL would have most likely got the ships for cheaper from a subsidised yard somewhere else in Europe, but CCL selected Wärtsilä due to its good reputation as a cruise ship builder. The fourth problem came from lack of employees. Wärtsilä, and later Wärtsilä Marine, had reduced the personnel heavily in 1985–1988. The company had to use subcontractors for high costs. The lack of employees caused strikes in particular in Perno yard.  Disclosure of financial troubles  During its first operating year, 1987, Wärtsilä Marine made FIM 205 million of losses, which was expected. The truth about the Valmet contract with Soviet Union started to come out during 1988. Despite of the losses, Wärtsilä Marine did its utmost to be able to deliver the ordered craft to Soviet Union, because it wanted to maintain the long-term business partnership. The Valmet Laivateollisuus yard in Turku was closed and the work was moved to Rauma-Repola and Hollming yards, where the work was performed as subcontracting and high costs. More losses came from Monterey project, which included converting an old American freight ship into cruise ship in the old Wärtsilä Turku shipyard. In the same year Pekka Laine left his position in Wärtsilä Marine and moved to the parent Wärtsilä. Kari Airaksinen became the new manager of Marine. The result of the year collapsed down to FIM 638 million of losses and Wärtsilä Marine's situation started to look alarming. In the annual report of Wärtsilä Corporation this was formulated: \\"the Marine division is at the front of increasing changes\\".  Rescue efforts  The general manager of Wärtsilä Corporation Tor Stolpe resigned at the end of 1988 and Pekka Laine was appointed to his place from beginning of 1989. Laine started frantically pondering a way to save the corporation from the Wärtsilä Marine's losses which were then estimated already one billion Finnish markka. Saarikangas was called back to Finland from the US and reinstalled the head of Helsinki Shipyard; he directly set up a team to start an urgent reorganisation programme. But the time was running out. The media reported at the beginning of August that Wärtsilä Marine is on the verge of bankruptcy and it could be only saved by urgent support by the state. The owners were not able to support the shipbuilder any more. The state was not willing to help; Bror Wahlroos from the ministry of trade and industry declared that the state refuses becoming owner of Marine. However, on 10 August the state and Wärtsilä Marine announced a financing plan, in which also two Finnish banks were involved, for carrying out the unfinished shipbuilding projects. Wärtsilä sold 51% of Wärtsilä Marine to Yhdyspankki, Oy Pomi Trading Ab, Wärtsilä pension fund and Wärtsilä pension foundation.; the total price of the shares was four Finnish markka. After this the ownership of Wärtsilä Corporation had fallen under 19% and therefore it did not have to treat it as subsidiary in the financial statements.  Bankruptcy  On 12 October the board of Marine suggested setting the company into bankruptcy in a general meeting that should be held on 2 November. The current losses were estimated FIM 1.6 billion. In the same day the workers of Perno shipyard were striking and demanding for 10% salary increase. The board of Wärtsilä Marine was called urgently for a meeting on 23 October 1989. The company cash reserve was out. The company operated by weekly FIM 60 million bills of exchange. The board decided to declare the company into bankruptcy, which came into force at 3:30 pm in the same day.  Events after the collapse  At the very moment of bankruptcy declaration Saarikangas gave his famous speech to the workers of Helsinki Shipyard. The yard workers and subcontractors, who had suddenly lost their livelihood, were shocked from the news. Saarikangas ended his speech assuring that the bankruptcy will not mean the end of the shipbuilding, if the workers will be ready to continue it on new terms. Directly after his speech Saarikangas called Ted Arison, the American owner of Carnival Cruise Lines, which had three cruise ships on Wärtsilä Marine's order book. Arison arrived in Finland just eleven hours after; this was followed by a number of meetings and negotiations with creditors and other parties. Just four days after Saarikangas set up a new company, Helsinki New Shipyard. The financial basis for finalising the unfinished ships was ensured by a letter of intent signed by Arison. Turku yard was restarted in the same manner, under name Turku New Shipyard. Both yards were organised under new company Masa-Yards on 9 November; name Masa comes from Martin Saarikangas's initials. Saarikangas has told afterwards that restarting of the yards would not have been possible without the help of Ted Arison.  Aftermath  Saarikangas found the bankruptcy unnecessary, claiming it was just based on shortage of liquidity, as the company was about to receive a payment for Cinderella and a couple of months after CCL would have given 80% payment for cruise ship Fantasy. On the other hand, he thinks that the bankruptcy was, although theoretically avoidable, still the easiest way to restructure the company; Saarikangas hired back almost all the blue collar workers but just two-thirds of the white collars.

It is the first image-guided, MR-compatible surgical robot that has the capability to perform both microsurgery and stereotaxy. IMRIS, Inc. acquired NeuroArm assets in 2010, and the company is working to develop a next generation of the technology for worldwide commercialization. It will be integrated with the VISIUS(TM) Surgical Theatre under the name SYMBIS(TM) Surgical System. Design NeuroArm was designed to be image-guided and can perform procedures inside an MRI. NeuroArm includes two remote detachable manipulators on a mobile base, a workstation and a system control cabinet. For biopsy-stereotaxy, either the left or right arm is transferred to a stereotactic platform that attaches to the MR bore. The procedure is performed with image-guidance, as MR images are acquired in near real-time. The end- effectors interface with surgical tools which are based on standard neurosurgical instruments. End-effectors are equipped with three-dimensional force-sensors, providing the sense of touch. The surgeon seated at the workstation controls the robot using force feedback hand controllers. The workstation recreates the sight and sensation of microsurgery by displaying the surgical site and 3D MRI displays, with superimposed tools. NeuroArm enables remote manipulation of the surgical tools from a control room adjacent to the surgical suite. It was designed to function within the environment of 1.5 and 3.0 tesla intraoperative MRI systems. As neuroArm is MR-compatible, stereotaxy can be performed inside the bore of the magnet with near real-time image guidance. NeuroArm possesses the dexterity to perform microsurgery, outside of the MRI system. Telerobotic operations both inside and outside the magnet are performed using specialized tool sets based on standard neurosurgical instruments, adapted to the end effectors. Using these, NeuroArm is able to cut and manipulate soft tissue, dissect tissue planes, suture, biopsy, electrocauterize, aspirate and irrigate. History The project began in 2002 when Daryl, B.J., and Don Seaman provided $2 million to fund the design efforts. Dr. Sutherland and his group established a collaboration with the Canadian space engineering company MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates (MDA). Close collaboration between MDA's robotic engineers and University of Calgary physicians, nurses, and scientists contributed to the design and development of NeuroArm. Official launch of the project was on April 17, 2007. NeuroArm was designed to take full advantage of the imaging environment provided by intraoperative MRI. The ability to couple near real-time, high resolution images to robotic technologies provides the surgeon with image guidance, precision, accuracy, and dexterity. MDA's engineers were immersed in the operating room to study typical tool and surgeon motions in order to use biomimicry for effective design of the computer-assisted surgical device. The OR environment, personnel, surgical rhythm and instrumentation remain unchanged. The surgeon, sitting at the workstation, is provided a virtual environment that recreates the sight, sound, and touch of surgery. Functions like tremor filtering and motion scaling were applied to increase precision and accuracy while functions like no-go zones and linear lock were applied to enhance safety. Surgical tools near the patient's head are incapable of fully independent movement and are slaved to the surgeon’s movement at all times. Pre-planned automatic motions are used to move the robot arms away from the patient's head for manual tool exchange, and then return them to the original position and orientation. On May 12, 2008, the first image-guided MR- compatible robotic neurosurgical procedure was performed at University of Calgary by Dr. Garnette Sutherland using the NeuroArm.. www.ucalgary.ca (16 May 2008).

Merrie Melodies theatrical cartoon short directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese. The cartoon was released on November 27, 1954 and stars Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. This cartoon in many ways resembles the 1951 short directed by Chuck Jones entitled Drip- Along Daffy. In this animated piece, upon seeing a wanted poster with a reward of $10,000.00 for the dead or alive capture of Nasty Canasta, Daffy sets out alongside his companion Porky and his trusty steed to retrieve the villain and collect the money. The cartoon can be found on the sixth volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, as well as the second volume of its Blu-ray Disc successor, the Platinum Collection (along with Drip-Along Daffy and Barbary Coast Bunny). Summary Much like Drip-Along Daffy, this cartoon parodies the widely popular Westerns of the time period. The Masked Avenger (Daffy) and his sidekick Comedy Relief (Porky) ride along in the desert until they come across a poster offering $10,000 reward for Nasty Canasta, wanted dead or alive for crimes including horse stealing, candy stealing, gag stealing, sheriff scaring and square dancing in a round house. \\"This looks like a job for...the Masked Ee-venger\\", Daffy shouts. \\"And besides, it isn't the principle of the thing, it's the money.\\" Following large conspicuous signs literally pointing the way to (and at) to Canasta's hide-out, Daffy tells Porky to wait outside 'whilst I go in and fix his little red wagon'. Daffy bursts into the hideout, to find Canasta sitting peacefully at a table playing cards. He announces himself as the Masked Avenger, then as the Frisco Kid and later as Superguy, but Canasta pays no attention until Daffy offers advice on his card game, to which Canasta asks if Daffy plays cards. Challenged to join the game, Daffy departs and returns in new cowboy garb (but without the mask), confident of victory. What follows is the humiliation of Daffy again and again through different gags and challenges. The first round of the card game is ended abruptly when Canasta literally cuts the deck of cards with a meat cleaver, nearly cutting off Daffy's hand as well. Daffy deals the cards, giving Canasta one and himself the rest of the deck. Canasta \\"wins\\" the hand when he pokes a pistol in Daffy's mouth and declares \\"I gotta 3 of Clubs.\\" Daffy nervously says, \\"Beats me!\\" The next scene opens with Canasta reading The Gravedigger's Joke Book by Burke and Hare, while Daffy attempts to roll a cigarette (ending up with just the paper in his mouth). Daffy challenges Canasta to an arm wrestling match, which Canasta easily wins, smashing Daffy into and through the table. Porky appears and suggests to Daffy, \\"Why don't you plain old arrest him?\\" Daffy tries that, but when he puts Canasta in irons, Canasta effortlessly breaks the handcuffs, and when Daffy tries to take him away, he finds that he cannot move Canasta from the spot he is standing. Daffy then gets annoyed and angry, telling Canasta that he is going to give him a fist beating, with Porky encouraging Daffy (telling him to fix Canasta's 'little red wagon'). However, Daffy's spunk ends badly for Daffy himself, as Canasta rips his shirt right off just by flexing his muscles before beating up Daffy. The house shakes as Porky sits outside whittling with a knife and a stick, saying things like \\"Oh, h-h-h-he'll murder him.\\" Daffy then emerges from the house after a few seconds, dazed and staggering with slurred speech, proclaiming that he indeed fixed Canasta's little red wagon, followed by Daffy staggering outside the house with a shiny new red wagon ('I told you I'd fix his little red wagon. You should've seen it. The wheels were busted, the axle was all bent, and it needed a new coat of paint. Now...now I'm going home to Mother.') before collapsing.

He attended the common schools and the Whitestown Seminary and graduated from Yale College in 1850, where he was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi and Skull and Bones. He served as principal of Utica Free Academy in 1850 and 1851 and became editor and proprietor of the Utica Morning Herald 1851 - 1889. He was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1864, 1868, and 1876; and a member of the New York State Assembly (Oneida Co., 2nd D.) in 1867. Ellis H.

Ellis Henry Roberts the protectionist  Ellis Henry Roberts’ Government Revenue, Especially the American System. An Argument for Industrial Freedom vindicates the policy of favoring developing domestic commerce over foreign commerce which protectionism does best. Roberts was also a member of the American Protective Tariff League. He stated that the tariff has been one of the main reasons why our production has been augmented. When we have had low duties something equivalent to free trade our, industries were battered and depressed, but they have thrived when protectionism was the policy. He saw the precious home market as for the home trade which was monumental, and were it to invite foreign commerce the home market would be sacrificed, and national sovereignty will be in peril. Thus, for strategic purposes the government should favor producers rather than those that exploit trade in all laws that it makes. Roberts considered the most benevolent act of good will that any people can perform to the public welfare is to not engage in what favors foreign commerce what trade likes most but to foster the diversity of employments, produce. He also thought that the legislator who seeks to have his nation engage in commerce without developing a diversity of employments acts like a person making the gravest of mistakes. In addition he stated that rather than decrease production, what we ought to do is create a perfectly more manufacturing sector, and excellent diversity of employments. Moreover, he concluded that poverty diminished at a direct ratio in which the diversity of industries had increased in the population. Next Roberts thought that civilization most greatest lesson is that the livelihood of all, most importantly the poor, has been elevated due to the new industries being erected, thus production has augmented the diversity of employments. With the policy of fostering the growth the diversity of employments, the United States possessed quite a promising future. It would be an egregious injustice for Washington D.C. to play an instrumental part in contracting our scale of production, and to opt for a revenue system that heavily courts foreign trade instead of facilitating a diversity of employments for our home markets.  Roberts on Adam Smith and Alexander Hamilton  Roberts knew what Adam Smith, Mr. Say and Professor William Sumner wanted for the United States. A nation with the potential of satisfying her home markets by developing an enormous home trade was told to organize their economy around agriculture; thus, making the United States be economically dependent on other nations. Roberts chose to side with Hamilton’s view of organizing an economy. Roberts gives a precise brief commentary on Hamilton’s celebrated Report on Manufactures, he says Hamilton considered relying on foreign commerce by mainly using agricultural goods as a waste. He also saw England’s fortified regulations which only invited raw materials and food stuffs as not something the young nation wanted to take advantage of. Hamilton thought that America’s agriculture’s best market was in America, and that developing resources that insured America’s future was paramount. In addition to this Hamilton strongly asserted that the government had the right to stimulate and foster acquiring knowledge, manufactures, agriculture, and commerce. He saw duties on imports as a strategic way to elevate manufactures. Moreover he added that bounties, premiums and some raw materials be brought in free of duty, and that inventors be rewarded for their congenial pursuits that benefited man. Lastly Hamilton saw the these actions as quite worthwhile to pursue to create a constant mass clientele for the agricultural commodities in the home market.  American commerce versus British commerce  Roberts did not want the United States to forsake its home trade and favor the ways of the British. The British way was foreign commerce. England relied on foreign commerce so much because her production was too dependent on foreign consumption, but U.S production relied on domestic consumption, and the U.S home market was becoming the envy of all those nations that conducted foreign commerce. Roberts said, “We want no commerce which we do not win on the field of fair competition. We refuse to maintain a costly navy to force our commodities on unwilling peoples. We have always declined every suggestion to conduct our diplomacy in the interest of foreign trade, except as it is welcomed by the peoples whom we go to seek. The course which we are pursuing has never before been pursued by any great nation, the story of commerce has been a story of violence and grasping greed. The wars of the world have been in large part incited by the purpose to extort treasure and commodities, and to thrust the products of the aggressive power upon reluctant peoples.”Government Revenue, Especially the American System.

His books include Skeletons on the Zahara (2004) and Unbound (2010), both published by Little, Brown. He is the author of companion books to Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series of novels and is the first biographer of O'Brian. In his biography, Patrick O'Brian: A Life (2000), which was excerpted in four full pages in the Daily Telegraph in London, King revealed that O'Brian was not really of Irish origin, as O'Brian claimed, and that he had changed his name by deed poll in London in 1945. King has also published articles in The New York Times, National Geographic Adventure, New York Magazine, Outside and other magazines and newspapers. Early life and education King was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia, where he attended St. Christopher's School. He then attended the University of North Carolina, where he played on UNC's 1982 National Champion Lacrosse team and edited the undergraduate literary magazine while earning his bachelor's degree in English. He was also a member of the North Carolina Xi chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. After graduating, he and a friend spent a week and a half walking across the entirety of England. He earned his master's degree in English at New York University, studying under Gloria Naylor, John A. Williams, and E. L. Doctorow. Writing career =Magazines= After further travel in England and France, King worked for a decade in New York City. While there he became an original contributing editor to Men's Journal and wrote for other publications, including Esquire, Art & Antiques, Travel + Leisure Magazine, Connoisseur, and The New York Times. He is a past director of book publishing at National Review. In the early 1990s he also founded the out-of-print Bubba Magazine, a publication that poked fun at Bill Clinton. The publication garnered national press after its February 9, 1993, debut, with media outlets such as Entertainment Tonight booking interviews. =Non-fiction books= King has published ten books, most with a focus on historical and adventure narratives. Many of King's works focus on sea adventure and maritime history, and he is past series editor for the Heart of Oak Sea Classics. In 1995 King co-authored A Sea of Words with naval historian John B. Hattendorf and J. Worth Estes, and two years later he again worked with Hattendorf to edit and publish Every Man Will Do His Duty. Both are companion books to Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series of novels. In 2000 he also wrote a historically significant but unauthorized biography of famed author Patrick O'Brian, which was published just three months after O'Brian's death. This book, Patrick O'Brian: A Life Revealed, was named a book of the year by The Telegraph, and King appeared in a BBC documentary about O'Brian, as well as on ABC World News Tonight and NPR's Talk of the Nation. For his 2004 non-fiction book, Skeletons on the Zahara, he traveled more than 100 miles across the western Sahara Desert on foot and by camel in order to experience a similar journey to Captain James Riley. During research for Unbound: A True Story of War, Love, and Survival he spent July 2009 in China's Sichuan province, trekking eight days through treacherous highland bogs and hiking up the Dagushan Mountain on the Tibetan border. As with Africa, his goal was to retrace his historical protagonists' dangerous journey, in this case the 30 women who walked 4,000 miles in the Communists' Long March with Mao Zedong in 1934. Community work In the early 2000s, Dean was part of a group of Richmond writer friends, including founder and best-selling novelist David L. Robbins, to create the nonprofit James River Writers, which promotes and encourages local authors. He is past co-chair and advisory board member. King also helped establish the James River Writers Conference, which is held annually at the Richmond Library of Virginia. King is also frequently asked to give talks to schools and community groups. He serves on the boards of the Library of Virginia Foundation and the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts (VCCA). He is a founder and co-chair of the Virginia Literary Festival (VLF), a week-long, multi-organizational celebration of reading and authors in Richmond. Personal life King is a cancer survivor and avid hiker. He currently lives in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia with his wife Jessica and their four daughters: Hazel, Grace, Willa, and Nora.

A black man or Arab came to the king and offered a potion that would make the queen pregnant. The cook prepared it and, not knowing its powers, tasted some before coming to the queen. Both the cook and the queen became pregnant and each gave birth to a son. When the prince was grown, the king had to go to war. He gave the keys to the castle and told him not to go into the door locked by the golden key. The prince went into it and found a spy glass that showed him the beautiful Princess Kiralina, and he fell so in love with her that he was sick and near dying. The king sent messengers but her father refused to let them marry. The prince decided to go ask her himself, and his foster brother, the cook's son, went with him. They came to a hut where an old woman could not tell them; her son, the North Wind, might turn them to ice, so she sent them on to the Wild Wind. They could not stay there, either, but went on the house of the Spring Wind. The wind's mother, a tall and elegant woman, hid them because her son might kill them. When the wind came, his mother asked him how to reach Princess Kiralina, and the wind told her how it would take ten years; a fairy log, in a black forest by a river of pitch, could carry anyone there instantly, but whoever told that would turn to stone to his knees. Once there, the person had to make a golden stag and use it to smuggle himself into the princess's room, but whoever knew that would be turned to stone up to his waist. If that succeeded and the princess married, the Northwind's mother would spitefully send her a dress of cobwebs, and unless she washed in the tears of doves, she would be killed. The prince slept through it, but the cook's son heard it. The cook's son told the prince to trust him and carried him to the princess by the log. The princess fell in love with him at sight and grew ill with longing. A hag told the king that a golden stag, put in her room, would cure her. The cook's son turned the log into a golden stag and hid the prince inside it. The cook's son agreed to hire it to the king, and the king brought it to the princess's room. At night the prince sneaked from the form and kissed the princess; the next night, she feigned sleep and caught him. When the cook's son came to take it back, the princess came alongside it, and the cook's son turned the stag into a chariot that carried them all off. The prince and princess married. Later, when the princess was queen, she bought a gown of cobwebs. Secretly, the cook's son sprinkled her with the tears of doves, but was seen and accused of kissing the queen. The prince, now a king, ordered him beheaded. The cook's son explained what he had heard and was turned to stone. Later, the king and queen had a child and dreamed if they killed the child and put the blood on the statue, it would come to life. They did, and the statue did. The cook's son pricked his finger and put the blood on the dead child, who came back to life. Commentary The opening account of the birth of the two children is a motif found in other tales, such as The Seven-headed Serpent, where a prince and a horse are similar linked by their births. Most of the plot, however, is similar to such fairy tales as Trusty John, In Love with a Statue, and Father Roquelaure.

For the member of Ice Creamusume, see Gu Yun (singer). Gu Yun in Yuan Style, Nantoyōsō Collection, Japan Gu Yun (, pinyin: Gù Yún, (1835–1896) was a Chinese master landscape artist. His courtesy name was Ruopo (trad. chars. 雲壺, simpl. chars. 若波, “Like Waves”). His pen name was Yunhu (云壶, “Cloud Vase”). Gu was a native of the cultural mecca of Suzhou, but eventually joined the community of artists in Shanghai. He must have had access to local collections of old masters because his paintings show a mastery of classical themes. His paintings clearly show a profound respect for and influence from 17th century academic masters such as the “Four Wangs” and others. Gu's works are noted for the distinctive use of ink tones, although some criticized his work as lacking in vitality. He traveled to Japan in 1888 where he sojourned at the official Qing Embassy. On his journey to Kyoto, Gu nearly forced by a flood to remain at Nagoya. This was a loss for Japanese art that happened in 1889. After his death, Gu's reputation soared, but unfortunately the best collection of his landscapes in Japan perished in the fires of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. Noted works of the artist are extant there however. A printed selection of his paintings appeared in 1926.  References  *Shen Roujian, A Dictionary of Chinese Fine Arts, Shanghai, 1987, p. 112\\\\.

The name change occurred formally on Thursday 22 February 2018 due to reports confirming the association of Lord Alfred Milner, whom the Hall was named after, with crimes against humanity in Africa among other actions driven by his self-proclaimed 'British race supremacy' ideology. Founded in 1927, Freedom Hall currently has housing for 333 students. Hall Pledge I pledge to uphold the principles and precepts of this Great Hall, And to do all in my power, Whenever and wherever possible, To make this hall a beautiful place in which to live, And a home away from home, FOR ON FREEDOM, MILNERITES STAND TOGETHER AS ONE. YAY! History Milner Hall was built in 1927 when UWI was still known as the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture (ICTA). It was named after the late Lord Viscount Milner. When ICTA became UWI in 1963 Milner Hall continued to serve as a means of accommodation for students. During the period 1927 to present, Milner Hall moved from being one block of residency (West Block) and an additional dining facility to five blocks with an administrative building namely North Block, South Block, West Block, I Block, Post graduate Flats and the Cafe. In 2018 Milner Hall was renamed freedom hall by the administration of UWI after an extended period of liaising with students. Layout The hall consists of 5 blocks, located throughout the compound, namely: West Block, Milner Hall. * West Block - a Co-Ed block consisting of 32 single-occupancy rooms, 16 male on the lower floor and 16 female on the upper floor. West Block is the most revered block on Milner Hall as its residents are members of the Hall committee and mainly students in their final year of undergraduate study, who have lived most of their UWI lives on the hall. North Block, Milner Hall. * North Block - an all-male block consisting of 32 double-occupancy rooms. Its occupants are mainly students in the university who are in their first or second year of undergraduate study. North Block is one of the most popular blocks on hall, as it houses the hall's gym. South Block, Milner Hall. * South Block - an all-female block consisting of 32 double-occupancy rooms. Its occupants are mainly students in the university who are in their first or second year of undergraduate study. South Block is well known for its annual hosting of Milner Hall's International Food Day and South Block's Next Top Model. (Note: West Block, North Block and South Block are all named for their locations relative to the administrative offices of the hall.) Post Graduate Block, Milner Hall. * Post Graduate Flats - This Block comprises five self containing Flats, each divided into four upper level bedrooms with the lower level used as a common living area. Each flat is either all male or all female. Its residents comprise single post graduate students. =I Block= The original I Block was demolished in 2005, since then it is now the newest addition to Milner Hall and is now the recently renovated and enlarged I Block. I Block is four stories tall, houses 153 students and encompasses much of the hall's Northwestern grounds. Each floor is co-ed and houses male students in the western flanks and female students in the east. The floor layout for I block is as follows: * Ground Floor - This floor is for undergraduate students and comprises 22 double-occupancy rooms, 11 male and 11 female.

The game was developed by Graphic State and released by Midway for the Game Boy Advance in 2001. It is the only game in the series not to be preceded by an arcade release and features slightly different gameplay from its predecessors. The game uses the same engine as Dark Arena, a first-person shooter game also developed by Graphic State, to achieve a pseudo-3D effect. This approach garnered the game mixed reviews.  Gameplay  Unlike the previous games in the series instead of the racing down one-way courses consisting of streets based on real-life locations while avoiding various road hazards such as oncoming traffic and construction you travel through a large environment racing eleven different cars and winning the races without getting hit by walls and such. Fourteen different locations, the same as Cruis'n Exotica, are available. There's a new speed boost system by pressing on the gas button twice. There's also an option that you can have a damage system on or off and there will be a damage bar and it can go down when you crash into different objects. There are three different races to choose from. Players can run through the Cruis'n Cup which unlocks new courses and cars. Championship allows players go through courses and if to earn points like in Mario Kart. In Freestyle players can go through courses to get the highest track record.

Kao made his last appearance as Archie in the twelfth season episode \\"Split Decisions\\", which aired on April 4, 2012. Casting Actor Archie Kao was originally offered a guest appearance in one episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. When the show's executive producer, Jerry Bruckheimer saw the episode, he told Kao's agent that he wanted him to play a recurring character on the show. Kao told Frank Mustac from the Fairfax Times that he was \\"stunned\\" to learn that Bruckheimer wanted him back and said the show had given him a renewed confidence. Kao stated that his character was not named after him and it was just a coincidence they shared the same first name. Kao felt lucky to be cast in the show due to Asian actors having \\"severely limited roles\\" to play on television. From his introduction in the show's second season, Kao appeared in every season until his departure in 2012.

It is the church for a parish in the Diocese of London, part of the Church of England. Inside the Grade I listed building, there is seating for 400 people. There is a memorial plaque to the author Henry James (1843–1916) who lived nearby on Cheyne Walk. To the west of the church is a small public garden containing a sculpture by Sir Jacob Epstein.  History  Chelsea Old Church dates from 1157.Chelsea Old Church, Cheyne Walk, London SW3 , TourUK , UK. Formerly it was the parish church of Chelsea when it was a village, before it was engulfed by London. The building originally consisted of a 13th-century chancel with chapels to the north and south (c.1325) and a nave and tower built in 1670. The chapels were private property. The one to the north was called the Lawrence Chapel and was owned by Chelsea's Lord of the Manor. The chapel to the south was rebuilt in 1528 as Sir Thomas More's private chapel. The date can be found on one of the capitals of the pillars leading to the chancel, which were reputedly designed by Holbein. There is a statue by Leslie Cubitt Bevis of More outside the church, facing the river. There is a 1669 memorial to Lady Jane Cheyne. It was designed by the son of Gian Lorenzo Bernini and executed by Gian Lorenzo's favourite sculptor Antonio Raggi. It is the only London church to have chained books. They are the gift of Sir Hans Sloane, an Irish doctor, and consist of the so-called \\"Vinegar Bible\\" of 1717, two volumes of Foxe's Book of Martyrs (1684 edition), a prayer book (1723) and Homilies (1683). The church appears in several paintings by James McNeill Whistler and J. M. W. Turner, in all cases little more than distant tower; the church was painted white in the 19th century. For example, the church was depicted in the background of Whistler's Nocturne: Blue and Gold - Old Battersea Bridge, painted c.1872–5. Thomas More's statue in front of the Church The church suffered severe bombing damage during the Blitz of the Second World War in 1941, with the More Chapel least affected. Services were held in the adjoining hospital for nine years. In 1950 the More Chapel was reopened, followed by the chancel and Lawrence Chapel in May 1954, after restoration by the architect Walter Godfrey. In May 1958, the entire church was reconsecrated by the Bishop of London, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The Church has been restored in its entirety on its old foundations. It looks similar to the way it did before World War II. Many of the tombs inside have been reconstructed, almost like jigsaw puzzles. In 1978, Jack Leslau wrote an article in The Ricardian suggesting that one of the Princes in the Tower survived, namely Edward V of England, and is buried in Chelsea Old Church. His evidence depends on a complicated interpretation of a painting by Hans Holbein the Younger. Leslau's website expands on this thesis, but no major academic institution endorses the thesis.Holbein, Sir Thomas More & the Princes in the Tower, The Hans Holbein Foundation resource centre for research and development, Vol. V, No. 3., August 2004. The social reformer The Baroness Courtney of Penwith is buried in the church. In the year 2000, the Museum of London Archaeological Services carried out an archaeological dig at the cemetery.

A fullback (FB) is a position in the offensive backfield in gridiron football, and is one of the two running back positions along with the halfback. Typically, fullbacks are larger than halfback and in most offensive schemes their duties are split between power running, pass catching, and blocking for both the quarterback and the other running back. Many great runners in the history of American football have been fullbacks, including Jim Brown, Marion Motley, Jim Taylor, Franco Harris, Larry Csonka, John Riggins, Christian Okoye, and Levi Jackson. However, many of these runners would retroactively be labeled as halfbacks, due to their position as the primary ball carrier; they were primarily listed as fullbacks due to their size and did not often perform the run-blocking duties expected of modern fullbacks. Examples of players who have excelled at the hybrid running-blocking-pass catching role include Mike Alstott, Daryl Johnston, and Lorenzo Neal. History In the days before two platoons, the fullback was usually the team's punter and drop kicker.e. g. Clarence Herschberger When at the beginning of the 20th century, a penalty was introduced for hitting the opposing kicker after a kick, the foul was at first called \\"running into the fullback\\", inasmuch as the deepest back usually did the kicking. Before the emergence of the T-formation in the 1940s, most teams used four offensive backs, lined up behind the offensive line, on every play: a quarterback, two halfbacks, and a fullback. The quarterback began each play a quarter of the way \\"back\\" behind the offensive line, the halfbacks began each play side by side and halfway \\"back\\" behind the offensive line, and the fullback began each play the farthest \\"back\\" behind the offensive line. Each offensive back was known by a position name that described his relative distance behind the offensive line. As the quarterback was typically the offensive back who first touched the ball after the snap, quarterbacks were the offensive back most likely to pass the ball, although any eligible player may do so. As the game evolved and alternate formations came in and out of fashion, halfbacks (reduced to typically just one rather than two) emerged as the offensive back most likely to run the ball, although, again, any eligible player may do so. \\"Halfback\\" came to be synonymous with \\"running back\\". Fullbacks were primarily used as blocking backs with only occasional ball carrying duties. As formations began to favor placing the blocking back ahead of/ closer to the line of scrimmage than the running back, these blocking backs retained the name \\"fullback\\" even though they were closer to the offensive line than the halfback. \\"Fullback\\" became a misnomer, and the term \\"halfback\\" declined in usage, replaced variously with the more descriptive term \\"tailback\\" or the generic term \\"running back\\". In the modern game, when the quarterback is under center, the fullback most often lines up directly behind the quarterback and in front of the halfback or tailback. The fullback position has seen a decline in recent time, with only 17 full-time fullbacks playing in 2016. The trend can be traced back to teams choosing to pass more, the use of \\"11 personnel\\" (one running back and one tight end), and the use of hybrid \\"H-backs\\". Characteristics Fullback John Kuhn, with shirt #30, carrying the ball. Fullbacks are typically known less for speed and agility and more for muscularity and the ability to shed tackles. In 2010s NFL, fullbacks, while occasionally deployed as ball carriers, are often primarily a lead blocker to allow running backs to get to the secondary of the opposing team's defense. In the early 2000s, many NFL teams used blocking fullbacks, such as Tony Richardson and Lorenzo Neal, with great success. These backs cleared the way for some of the decade's great running backs. Later on, some teams have phased the fullback position out of their offense altogether, with those teams either all but eschewing the I-formation, or instead utilizing either a tight end, h-back, or backup running-back in the role. Today, there are several fullbacks still prominent in the NFL, among them C. J. Ham, Andy Janovich, Jamize Olawale, James Develin, Patrick Ricard (American football), Alec Ingold, Patrick DiMarco, Anthony Sherman, Kyle Juszczyk, and Keith Smith. In spite of their usually infrequent carries, some fullbacks have led their team in rushing - among the most notable ones were Le'Ron McClain who was the rushing leader for the Baltimore Ravens in 2008 and Tony Richardson who led the Kansas City Chiefs in rushing in 2000. Former Browns running back Peyton Hillis started his NFL career as a fullback before being converted into a halfback. =Blocking= Running behind the fullback: The QB is about to hand the ball over to the half back #45 who will run with it behind the full back #49 Although technically a running back, typically fullbacks are primarily valued for their blocking in most 21st century offenses. The most common and simple runs, the dive, and the blast, both employ the fullback as the primary blocker to \\"make way\\" for the halfback. In the flexbone formation, however, the fullback (sometimes referred to as the B-back) can often be used as the primary rushing threat. In many other offensive schemes, the fullback is used as a receiver, especially when the defense blitzes. In selected plays, some teams will have a defensive lineman report as an eligible receiver to line up as a fullback (\\"Jumbo\\" or \\"Heavy Jumbo\\") or as a tight end in a \\"Miami\\" package in goal-line formations. Players who have been frequently used as situational fullbacks include Haloti Ngata, Dontari Poe, Jared Allen while with the Kansas City Chiefs, Richard Seymour while with the New England Patriots, and Isaac Sopoaga while with the San Francisco 49ers, while Dan Klecko and Nikita Whitlock have played both as a defensive tackle and fullback. Defensive Tackle William \\"The Refrigerator\\" Perry scored a touchdown in Super Bowl XX from the fullback position. = Substitutes = Most teams in the NFL do not have a substitute fullback, though there are exceptions. The role can be filled by backup or number three or four tight ends or bigger and less-frequently-used running backs. Occasionally, defensive tackles have been used in the fullback position (famous examples include William \\"The Refrigerator\\" Perry and Kyle Williams); this is most commonly used in goal- line situations, where the defensive tackle's size and ability to penetrate a wall of players becomes an advantage. In modern offenses, fullbacks in an I-formation can be motioned into a 2-TE formation or H-back formation, making a running back or tight end fairly well suited to the role. =Canadian football= The fullback position is less frequently used in Canadian football, which focuses more on passing than running the ball.

Newspaper publisher Born in Alton, Canada West (now Ontario), Houston's career as a newspaper publisher in British Columbia spanned twenty-two years, beginning in 1888 in the town of Donald. Later he would publish newspapers in New Westminster, Nelson, Rossland and Prince Rupert. His last paper would be printed in 1910 at South Fort George. John was married, though his wife, Edith May Keeley, didn't follow him on his constant ramblings throughout the province and stayed at their mansion in Nelson. First mayor of Nelson John Houston was the first mayor of Nelson, British Columbia and served from 1897 to 1905. Political career John Houston was a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia for West Kootenay-Nelson from 1900 to 1903 and Nelson City from 1903 until 1907. During this time, he became well known for being a working-man's advocate and he often spoke against the policies of the Canadian Pacific Railway and supported a motion to stop provincial aid to railways. Prince Rupert Empire newspaper office 1907 Houston moved to Prince Rupert in summer 1907 to start the Prince Rupert Empire newspaper. In this paper he planned to continue his vocal opposition to the policies of the railroad, this time the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. The GTP knew full well of John's reputation and did not appreciate his presence in Prince Rupert—their terminus, and a town they had grand designs for. Before John could print a single edition, the GTP harbor engineer impounded his printing press in a small shed on the wharf. Undeterred, John decided to have his paper published in Victoria and when the first edition got to Prince Rupert, it carried the headline that the GTP discourages newcomers to town. Other editions followed, and for two months, the Victoria-based Prince Rupert Empire blazed with editorials, prose and often poetry, describing the railway managers as \\"tin-gods\\" and accusing them of \\"a thousand blunders\\". After only two months of editions, the Empire had sold 10,000 copies of a paper originally meant for a population of 500. Then, with the assistance of a local constable, John liberated his press and continued publishing. Charles Melville Hays, who was then the president of the Grand Trunk Pacific, arrived in Prince Rupert later that year and offered John a permit to put his building wherever he liked. But, by then, John didn't need a lot in Prince Rupert. He had filed on a mineral claim near the wharf and had built the Empire Newspaper Office. If Charles Hays had hoped that his intended cooperation with John would gain the railroad favor with the Empire, he must've been sorely disappointed. John began encouraging other people to squat on the mineral claims by the wharf, instead of buying lots in the new GTP townsite, thus creating the community of Knoxville. The Grand Trunk Pacific had had enough. When the lots at Prince Rupert went up for sale in 1909, the land John Houston's Empire was on was quietly bought by the railway themselves. John sold his newspaper for $10,000 and left for Fort George. Fort George Fort George Tribune office, John Houston on left John Houston arrived in Fort George in the fall of 1909 and bought property in South Fort George and began the Fort George Tribune. The first edition was published on November 6, 1909. Unfortunately, other than land claims notices there was little local news for his paper to report. In 1909, South Fort George was a First Nations village, a sawmill and a Hudson's Bay Store. Less than a dozen new residents lived in the infant town-site in tent shacks. The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, John's favorite villain, was still far away: not even across the Alberta/BC border on the eastern end of construction, and the construction from the western end at Prince Rupert had just begun. John's South Fort George articles were often humorous and included notices as to whose cow recently had a calf and what he'd had to pay for eggs that week. He commented in one article about how his socks often froze to the floor while he sat at his printing press and worked on the newspaper. Nevertheless, whether there was little news to report or not, John was a busy man from November 1909 to March 1910. He responded to approximately 300 letters a month, written mostly by parties interested in purchasing land in the area, and he was working on formulating a platform for the Liberal Party. In March 1910, the work and excessively cold caught up with him and John contracted pneumonia and was pulled on a toboggan down the Blackwater Trail to the Quesnel hospital by his friend and fellow pioneer settler, William J Cooke. John died on March 8 at the hospital in Quesnel, but not before he got a chance to read his own obituary, one printed in error by the Vancouver Province. His nurse, knowing his sense of humor, showed him the article, and he supposedly joked that he respected the paper and that they didn't need to make a correction because he was planning on making good on their story. John was laid to rest in Nelson, where there is a memorial in his honor. =Places named after John Houston= * Houston, British Columbia * Houston Lane in Prince George, British Columbia Footnotes References * A Thousand Blunders: The History of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in Northern British Columbia by Frank Leonard * A History of Prince George Rev FE Runnals * Prince George: Rivers, Railways and Timber Bev Christensen External links * District of Houston * Category:British Columbia Conservative Party MLAs Category:People from Caledon, Ontario Category:1850 births Category:1910 deaths Category:Mayors of places in British Columbia Category:Canadian newspaper editors Category:Canadian male journalists Category:Pre-Confederation Ontario people ","title":"John Houston (newspaperman)"},{"id":"10764982","text":"Oslo is an alternative/indie rock band based in California.

History =1858-60= The boomtown of Bridge River was one of a half-dozen gold rush-era settlements which sprang up in the vicinity of today's Lillooet, the others being Cayoosh Flat (Lillooet itself), Parsonsville, Marysville, the Upper Fountain (Fountain), and Pavilion. Located at the confluence of the Bridge River with the Fraser, the location of the Bridge River Fishing Grounds (aka Six Mile or Setl) the town sprang up around a toll bridge spanning the rapids, aka the Lower Fountain, as the location of this townsite was also called. The bridge was built by an entrepreneur who tore down a First Nations-built pole bridge which had spanned the river at the same spot. The resulting town included hotels, a bank, a barber and various \\"restaurants\\" and a blacksmith's, but it vanished very quickly as the river crossing at this point did not turn out to be popular, as ferry crossings farther downstream were closer to Cayoosh Flat and Parsonsville, which were across the river from each other, and charged fares competitive with the bridge tolls. No mention is made of when the bridge was torn down, or when the last surviving remnant of the town's buildings and businesses finally closed. Nothing survives of the townsite today. On the triangle of bench above the confluence of the rivers there are a couple of old log-cabin ruins, but they are remnants of a rancherie of the Xwisten First Nation, the Bridge River Indian Band, who now mostly live farther up the Bridge River a few miles. =1880s-1910s= The scattered population of the upper Bridge River in the days of its early exploration commonly referred to themselves as the residents of Bridge River, meaning the district and basin, although no town in the vicinity ever wore the name itself. Generally, especially in later years, residents of the upper Bridge River basin or the goldfield towns which eventually sprang up around it used the phrase \\"the Bridge River\\" to refer to the collection of communities, although as these became more well-established the specific usage to mean the upper goldfields area shifted to mean the entirety of the Bridge River Country, which includes the adjacent basin of Anderson and Seton Lakes. The residents of the lower Bridge River - below its Big Canyon - sometimes refer to themselves as living in \\"Bridge River\\" but normally will refer to the specific locality where they live - Moha, Applespring, Antoine Creek. =1920s-1960s= The name Bridge River also become the local convention for the hydroelectric townsite of the Bridge River Power Project at South Shalalth on Seton Lake following its establishment in the 1920s. This usage fell out of use after completion of the hydroelectric project, when most residents moved away and the economic and social character of the Lillooet Country changed as a result. The townsite was a model development by the 1920s power company which launched and then abandoned the project, and included well-built beam-frame houses, a fine hotel geared at mine-bound investors, community hall, skating rink-tennis court, and landscaped gardens. Virtually empty during the 1930s the townsite became one of the five relocation centres for Japanese-Canadian internees in the Lillooet area and thereby became the temporary home of Dr. Masajiro Miyazaki, who was appointed coroner in Lillooet during the war despite his internment and became one of Lillooet's two Order of Canada inductees. After World War II, the townsite was expanded as the power project was revived and went into full swing. In addition to new housing built on the ridgetop above the village, and extensive trailer camps and other housing at nearby Seton Portage and in Shalalth proper, and facilities in the original townsite were expanded to include large modern bunkhouses and a movie theatre, although the hotel had burned down in the early 1950s.

The anterior teeth protect the posterior teeth by providing for a plane of guidance during excursions, thus allowing the cusps of the posterior teeth to disclude rather than strike one another during lateral or protrusive movements from centric relation. In other words, the posterior teeth have much larger crowns and more cusps than the anterior teeth. Because posterior crowns are wider and possess cuspal projections in various configurations, the cusps of the maxillary teeth and those of the mandibular teeth have an opportunity to bang into each other during chewing, speech or simply meeting together when one bites down. To prevent this from happening, the anterior teeth of each arch will, ideally, be situated so as to come into contact before the cusps of the posterior teeth do, thus preventing wear on the posterior teeth. This requires less force because the anterior teeth are further from the joint (analogous to stopping a door further from its hinge). The posterior teeth protect the anterior teeth by providing a stable vertical dimension of occlusion. While anterior teeth may retain their natural position even after loss of posterior teeth, the masticatory forces will eventually cause the single-rooted anterior to splay, thus leading to a collapsed bite.

The Institute has been instrumental in establishing standards of practice and standards of self care that are adopted by the Green Cross Academy of Traumatology (see Green Cross, below). The Institute has been the home to several publishing efforts coordinated by Dr. Figley. Among others this includes the Psychosocial Stress Book Series, established with the 1978 book, Stress Disorders among Vietnam Veterans. The Institute enabled the development of the award-winning 2014 Encyclopedia of Trauma: An Interdisciplinary Guide. The project has brought together more than 350 experts from around the world who contributed entries to the nearly 1000-page reference book. The Institute has been instrumental in supporting or conducting dozens of studies focusing on human stress response, traumatic stress injuries, elements of resilience and how best to prepare for adversity, and focusing on secondary trauma measurement and management. Traumatology; The International Journal Figley was the editor in chief of Traumatology, an international peer-reviewed journal of Traumatology from 1994-2012. In 2006, ownership of the journal was transferred to Sage Publications. Sage sold the Journal to the American Psychological Association and published with their other journals online, although it continues to serve as the journal of the Green Cross Academy of Traumatology. Currently the Editor of Traumatology is Brian Bride, PhD, University of Georgia. Under Figley's direction, the journal highlights in its articles the Green Cross as a deployment entity, as well as the certifications sanctioned by the Academy. Recent articles have included certification reviews in Field Traumatology, Certified Traumatologist training, Certified Compassion Fatigue Educator training, and Certified Compassion Fatigue Therapist training. Recent topics covered by the journal include clinical traumatology services; trauma-informed, culturally competent assessment and treatment of individuals, families, groups and communities exposed to traumatic events; assessment and treatment of service providers and volunteers traumatized by their work with the traumatized; and psychological first aid and other emergency mental health services.

A major campaign by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British devastated the small communities on the northern and western branches of the Susquehanna River, prompting local militia leaders to order the evacuation. Most of the settlers relocated to Fort Augusta at modern-day Sunbury at the confluence of the North and West Branches of the Susquehanna River, while their abandoned houses and farms were all burnt. Some settlers returned soon after, but the attacks were renewed the following year, leading to a second evacuation known as The Little Runaway. These attacks on the Pennsylvania frontier led to retaliatory scorched earth tactics by the American army against the Native Americans, including Sullivan's Expedition, which destroyed more than 40 Iroquois villages. Background In 1768 the Colony of Pennsylvania and the Iroquois Confederacy signed the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, in which the boundary between colonial and Iroquois lands was adjusted in the colony's favor in exchange for some financial considerations and other guarantees. Settlers soon began arriving in the area (known as the \\"New Purchase\\") and increased settlements along the West Branch of the Susquehanna helped lead to the formation of Northumberland County in 1772. The settlements along the river were in what are now parts of Northumberland, Union, Lycoming, and Clinton Counties. Map of fortifications and streams in north-central Pennsylvania during the Big Runaway. Modern county borders are shown for orientation. The New Purchase territory extended as far west as \\"Tiadaghton Creek\\". The identity of this creek was disputed, with the colonists claiming it was Pine Creek (further west, giving them more territory), while the Iroquois claimed it was Lycoming Creek (further east). The colonial government recognized Lycoming Creek as the boundary, so settlements made to its west violated the treaty. Despite this, there were settlers west of Lycoming Creek and west of Pine Creek about to modern-day Lock Haven. Because they fell outside the colony's bounds, the settlers in this area received no protection or government from colony, so they formed their own system of self-rule, known as the Fair Play system. When the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, most of the settlers in that area were favored independence from Great Britain and supported the Patriot cause. About 75 soldiers from the territory that became Lycoming County served in the Continental Army, but the West Branch of the Susquehanna valley soon became a front in the war as well. According to tradition, the Fair Play Men made their own Declaration of Independence from Britain at the mouth of Pine Creek on July 4, 1776, unaware of the Continental Congress' Declaration. There had always been tensions between the settlers and natives, with some attacks, especially in the \\"Fair Play\\" area. This became more serious in the winter of 1777–78, when two settlers were killed by Native Americans in separate incidents, and two Native Americans in a party of nine were killed by Colonel John Henry Antes and his men in a skirmish after. Later a party of Native American raiders who had plundered along Buffalo Creek, near Lewisburg in Union County were stopped near modern Jersey Shore in Lycoming County and their booty was recovered. British-Iroquois planning As part of General John Burgoyne's failed 1777 campaign for the Hudson River, the British in Quebec recruited large numbers of Native Americans, some of whom participated in Burgoyne's campaign.Barr, pp. 142–144 Quebec's Governor Guy Carleton had previously restricted their use in Quebec territory (which at that time encompassed the Iroquois lands now in Pennsylvania) and specifically refused to release supplies for expeditions beyond the treaty line. Carleton was, however, ordered by Secretary of State George Germain to expand recruitment in May 1777.Mintz, pp. 17–20 This Carleton did, encouraging and funding John Butler at Fort Niagara for the purpose. During the winter of 1777–78, Butler, Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, and Seneca leaders Cornplanter and Sayenqueraghta planned operations for the 1778 campaign season.Barr, p. 147 These allies could not immediately agree on actions to take, but in a December 1777 meeting the Iroquois expressed a desire to launch \\"a very formidable irruption with their whole collected force\\" against the frontier.Mintz, p. 48 The Seneca leaders in particular sought to target the Susquehanna's west branch, since it provided access to their lands in what is now western New York.Barr, pp. 147–148 After first campaigning further south (in what is now West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania),Barr, p. 148 parties of Seneca, Cayuga, and Lenape warriors began moving into the upper Susquehanna valley.Mintz, p. 49 Raiding campaign On May 16, 1778 three settlers were killed by Native Americans near the mouth of Bald Eagle Creek, and three men, seven women, and several children were captured by Native Americans in two attacks over the next four days. Later in May three settler families on Loyalsock Creek were wiped out: their cabins were burnt, two were killed, and fourteen disappeared, presumed captured by Native Americans. In separate incidents in late May, three settlers (a man, woman and boy) were taken prisoner near modern Linden in Woodward Township, and three Fair Play men were killed (while one escaped) as they tried to get a boat to evacuate their families to Fort Horn at the mouth of Pine Creek. Near modern Lock Haven a skirmish led to the wounding of one Native American and one Fair Play man. Seneca war chief Cornplanter The local militias were short of men (as many had joined the army), weapons, and supplies. The Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania was focused on supplying the army and levied taxes, which were in some cases more than the net worth of the individual settlers. Despite pleas from the settlers for more assistance, the colonial government did not send help initially, but as the West Branch Susquehanna valley became a new theater of the war, the council reconsidered the matter. On May 21, 1778 it pledged to send the settlers \\"one hundred fire arms of which thirty-one are rifles\\" from Harris's Ferry (modern Harrisburg), plus another \\"seventy rifles [which] had been obtained from the Continental store\\", as well as allocating 500 pounds of lead (for bullets) and 250 pounds of gunpowder to the settlers. They also asked that General George Washington send 250 riflemen from the army to assist the defense of the frontier. However, none of this aid arrived in time to help the settlers. Primitive forts and smaller fortified houses gave the settlers some protection. From west to east, these included Fort Reed (at modern-day Lock Haven), Fort Horn (at the mouth of Pine Creek), Antes Fort (opposite modern Jersey Shore), a fortified house near the mouth of Lycoming Creek (modern Williamsport), the fortified Harris house near the mouth of Loyalsock Creek (modern Montoursville), Fort Muncy and the fortified Brady House (both near modern Muncy), and Fort Freeland (near modern Turbotville). As the situation worsened, more settlers moved temporarily to the forts and fortified houses. They were still vulnerable when they had to return to their homes and farms to tend to their crops and livestock. June 10, 1778 has been called the \\"bloodiest day\\" in the history of Lycoming County, with three separate attacks on parties of settlers. Two of these attacks were along Loyalsock Creek and the third was near Lycoming Creek. In the first incident a party of twelve, including a friendly Native American and a black man, set out from the fortified Wallis house near modern Muncy to look for stolen horses. Robert Covenhoven, a guide and former soldier, was sent as a messenger to order the party's return. When the party's commander, Captain Berry, refused to turn back, Covenhoven joined the party as a guide and scout. No horses were found, and returning via the same route they had taken earlier (against the advice of Covenhoven) the party was ambushed. Some were killed immediately, six were captured (including the black man, who was burned at the stake), and Covenhoven and a few others escaped. Meanwhile, a second party of three men had set out the same day from the Wallis house to retrieve cattle from the Thomson farm. They were ambushed there by a group of Native Americans and at least one Tory, with two settlers killed and the third wounded and taken prisoner. Yet another party was bringing supplies to the westernmost forts, heard the shots of this attack, but were too late to help. Later that same day, a party of sixteen settlers on its way to Lycoming Creek were attacked in what is now Williamsport. In what became known as the \\"Plum Tree Massacre\\", twelve of the sixteen were killed and scalped, including two women and six children. Two girls were taken prisoner, and a boy and a girl escaped and made it to settlements on Lycoming Creek. They were so frightened by the attack that they were unable to communicate clearly where it occurred. Later search parties found all the victims of the three attacks. It was thought that all the attacks were the work of one group of Native Americans and Tories that had come south along Lycoming Creek on the Sheshequin Path. Mass evacuation The stone Wallis House (seen here in 1984) was one of only two structures to survive the attacks, and is now the oldest building in Lycoming County All of these attacks and the lack of military help from the Pennsylvania government disheartened the settlers along the West Branch of the Susquehanna. In the early summer of 1778 news came of a group of Native American warriors, perhaps accompanied by Loyalist and British soldiers, heading for the West Branch Susquehanna River valley to destroy all the settlements there. This news was provided by a friendly Native American named Job Chiiloway at Fort Reed (modern Lock Haven), who was then murdered as he slept, by a drunk settler engaged in target shooting. The Wyoming Valley battle and massacre occurred on July 3, 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre). A mass attack there first overwhelmed small settler forts, followed by a massacre of many of the women and children who had taken refuge there. This news caused the local authorities to order the evacuation of the whole West Branch valley. At least two riders braved attacks to warn their fellow settlers. Rachel Silverthorn volunteered (when no man would) to leave the relative safety of Fort Muncy (in Muncy Township). She rode along Muncy Creek and the Wyalusing Path and warned settlers, who fled to the safety of Fort Muncy. Her own family's cabin was later burnt to the ground. Robert Covenhoven, who had served under George Washington in the Continental Army and survived the attacks of June 10, rode west along the ridge of Bald Eagle Mountain to warn settlers at Fort Antes (opposite what is now Jersey Shore) and the western part of the valley. Covenhoven is listed as a Fair Play Man and one of the signers of the Tiadaghton Declaration of Independence. Most settlers had already gathered at the small forts and fortified houses for safety, but now the forts and the settlers' homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to what is now Muncy, then further south to Fort Augusta at what is now Sunbury. Women and children rode on the rafts, while the men walked on the river bank to protect them and to drive along the livestock they had been able to save. Their abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers reported fleeing at night with the glow of their burning settlements lighting the sky behind them. Fort Horn and the other Fair Play Men settlements were all destroyed. In the New Purchase, only Fort Antes (made of hard-to-burn peeled oak logs) and the stone Wallis House survived the flames. The property losses were estimated at £40,000, and there were deaths among the settlers. Colonel Samuel Hunter, the commander of Fort Augusta, was roundly criticized for ordering the evacuation. Many at the time felt that military assistance would have allowed the settlers to withstand the attackers. Aftermath Some settlers soon returned, a few while the ruins of their homes still smoldered. Many of those who fled were recent immigrants from New Jersey, fleeing the war there. Many of those had been poorly equipped and were ill-equipped to withstand attacks, and simply returned to New Jersey. The government of Pennsylvania sent military aid. Colonel Thomas Hartley built Fort Muncy to protect returning settlers. On September 24, 1778 he led a force of about 200 men up the Sheshequin Path on Lycoming Creek to the North Branch of the Susquehanna to strike back against the Iroquois. Hartley's expedition covered about 300 miles (500 km) in two weeks, defeated several bands of Iroquois and destroyed a few native villages. This proved the feasibility of operating in the Iroquois territory and preceded the Continental Army's major expedition into Iroquois territory the next year. In the summer of 1779, General John Sullivan led an expedition that went up the North Branch of the Susquehanna and destroyed at least forty Native American villages in New York and Pennsylvania in a scorched earth campaign. The Native Americans were aware of Sullivan's plans and launched their own attack on the West Branch of the Susquehanna, hoping to draw off Sullivan or even attack him from behind. Their attacking force was discovered as it descended the Sheshequin Path along Lycoming Creek by Robert Covenhoven, sent as a scout again. The authorities ordered a second evacuation, so that those settlers who had returned did so only to flee a second time in the summer of 1779, in what became known as the \\"Little Runaway\\". The second force was about 200 Native Americans and 100 British and Tory soldiers and attacked the valley again. While the evacuation was less panicked this time, Fort Freeland (near modern Turbotville and Watsontown) did not evacuate. It is unclear if they failed to receive the order to evacuate or ignored it, but over half of the settlers who had fled there were killed, with most of the rest taken prisoner. In any case, Sullivan's expedition and the harsh winter that followed it helped reduce attacks, stabilized the area, and encouraged resettlement. The Little Runaway and Sullivan's Expedition also led to an increased commitment by the government to the security of the frontier.

It runs from Maryland Route 318 (MD 318) at the Maryland border east of Federalsburg, Maryland to U.S. Route 9 (US 9) in Georgetown. DE 18 runs concurrent with DE 404 from its intersection with that highway southeast of Bridgeville to the eastern terminus, where DE 404 continues eastward to Five Points on US 9\\\\. The route passes through rural areas of western Sussex County. What would become DE 18 was built as a state highway in stages during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1936, DE 18 was designated to run from the Maryland border east through Georgetown to Lewes. In 1974, the route east of Georgetown was replaced by US 9 and US 9 Business (US 9 Bus.). DE 404 was designated along the eastern portion of DE 18 by 1987. Route description DE 18/DE 404 westbound in Georgetown DE 18 begins at the Maryland border, where the road continues west into that state as MD 318\\\\. From the state line, the route heads east on two-lane undivided Federalsburg Road, passing through agricultural areas with some woods and homes. The road runs through the community of Atlanta, where it crosses Atlanta Road. In Clarksons Crossroads, DE 18 turns southeast onto Cannon Road while Federalsburg Road continues northeast toward the town of Bridgeville. The road continues to the community of Cannon, where it crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade. East of Cannon, the route crosses Clear Brook before it comes to an intersection with US 13\\\\. Following this, DE 18 heads northeast through farm fields, reaching a junction with DE 404. At this point, DE 18 heads east concurrent with DE 404 along Seashore Highway through a mix of farmland and woodland with some residences. The road crosses the Nanticoke River and passes through tracts of the Redden State Forest, heading across Gravelly Branch to the south of Collins Pond and crossing Deep Creek further east. DE 18/DE 404 enters the town of Georgetown and becomes Bridgeville Road, running to the north of the Jack F. Owens Campus of Delaware Technical Community College. The road intersects US 113 and the western terminus of DE 404 Truck in a commercial area and continues east. The two routes head southeast onto North Bedford Street, passing homes and businesses. The road intersects US 9 at a traffic circle called The Circle in the center of Georgetown, where the Sussex County Courthouse is located. At this point, DE 18 ends and DE 404 continues east along US 9. The section of DE 18 concurrent with DE 404 serves as part of a primary hurricane evacuation route from the Delaware Beaches to points inland. DE 18 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 20,266 vehicles at the US 113 intersection to a low of 2,128 vehicles at the US 13 intersection. The portion of DE 18 concurrent with DE 404 is part of the National Highway System. History By 1920, what would eventually become DE 18 was under contract as a state highway from southeast of Bridgeville to Georgetown and from Georgetown to Harbeson; the remainder existed as an unimproved county road. The state highway was completed between Cannon and present-day US 13 and from southeast of Bridgeville east to Lewes by 1924, with the exception of a portion within Georgetown. The part of present-day DE 18 west of Clarksons Crossroads was under proposal as a state highway by this time also. A year later, the portions of the route west of Clarksons Crossroads and within Georgetown were upgraded to state highway status. In 1927, plans were made to replace the 1914-built county-maintained bascule bridge over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal in Lewes. Replacement of this bridge by the state was completed in 1929. By 1931, the state highway was finished between Clarksons Crossroads and Cannon. The portion of road from US 13 east to the current west end of the DE 404 concurrency was completed as a state highway a year later. DE 18 was designated to run from the Maryland border west of Cannon east to Lewes Beach on the Delaware Bay by 1936, following its current alignment east to Georgetown and continuing east through Gravel Hill, Harbeson, and Lewes. In 1974, the eastern terminus of DE 18 was cut back to its current location in Georgetown, with an extended US 9 replacing the route between Georgetown and Five Points and US 9 Bus. replacing DE 18 from Five Points to Lewes.

In 1919 he succeeded Raphaël Blanchard (1857-1919) as professor of parasitology to the Faculté de Médecine de Paris, a position he maintained until 1948. Much of his career was spent performing research in Africa and Latin America. Brumpt is credited for introducing a technique known as xenodiagnosis into parasitological research. In 1935 he described Plasmodium gallinaceum, an avian malarial parasite that infects chickens and other fowl.Plasmodium Gallinaceum Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Urbana, IllinoisGoogle Books War and Disease: Biomedical Research on Malaria in the Twentieth Century by Leo B. Slater He also conducted important research involving the African tsetse fly (Glossina palpalis) as a biological vector for trypanosomiasis.Google Books International clinics, page 43. In addition, he did extensive studies of the diseases: schistosomiasis, Chagas disease, onchocerciasis and leishmaniasis. He described Blastocystis hominis and Entamoeba dispar. The latter species helped to explain why most people who appeared to be infected with Entamoeba histolytica were asymptomatic. However, because there are no morphological differences between the two species, his proposal was largely ignored for over 50 years before being proven correct using molecular techniques. The French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Prix Savigny for 1910. A number of parasitic species bear his name, including Plasmodium brumpti and Xenocoeloma brumpti. Also, a genus of phlebotomine sand flies, Brumptomyia, and a species of Corsican mosquito, Culex brumpti, are named after him. Brumpt's best known written work is Précis de Parasitologie, which was published in six editions between 1910 and 1949. He was the author of many scientific papers, including several on the Anopheles mosquito and its relationship to malaria. He was the President of the Société zoologique de France in 1922. With Maurice Neveu-Lemaire and Maurice Langeron, he founded in 1923 the parasitological journal Annales de Parasitologie Humaine et Comparée, now continued as Parasite.

The program offered degrees in Mechanical Engineering and in Fine Arts/Design and was closely connected with the Stanford d.school (The d.school is not one of the seven schools at Stanford and does not grant degreeshttp://dschool.stanford.edu/learning-experiences/#get-a-degree). Background Students in Design Loft The program was founded in 1958. It has three full-time faculty. It maintains very close links with the venture capital, finance and technology firms of nearby Silicon Valley. Admissions statistics and student profile Aerial view of the Main Quad. The program has historically been the most selective program at the already highly selective Stanford. History Stanford's Design program dates from 1958 when Professor John E. Arnold, formerly of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, first proposed the idea that design engineering should be human-centered. This was a radical concept in the era of Sputnik and the early Cold War. Building on Arnold's work, Bob McKim (Emeritus, Engineering) along with Matt Kahn (Art), created the Product Design major and the graduate-level Joint Program in Design. This curriculum formalized in the mid-1960s, making the Joint Program in Design (JPD) one of the first inter-departmental programs at Stanford or other nationally prominent Universities. The texts in those days were McKim's recently published Experiences in Visual Thinking, and Jim Adams', Conceptual Blockbusting, a Guide to Better Ideas. The \\"loft\\" was a bootleg attic space in Building 500 that the University didn't know about (and the faculty pretended didn't exist). ME101: Visual Thinking was the introductory class for all product design students and the class included four \\"voyages\\" in the Imaginarium, a 16-foot geodesic dome that presented state-of-the art multimedia shows designed to stimulate creativity. The Loft moved to its current location behind the Old Firehouse. Bob McKim went Emeritus; Matt Kahn, Rolf Faste and David Kelley continued instruction in the tradition of merging art, science and needfinding though the 1980s and 1990s. Forty-some years later ME101 is still taught, although the Mechanical Engineering Department and the Department of Art no longer continue their historic collaboration with faculty drawn from both schools for instruction.

Patterson was born to British parents in New Zealand in 1902. Shortly afterwards the family moved to Montreal, Canada and later to London, England. In 1920 Patterson moved to Canada for college at McGill University, Montreal. Firstly he concentrated on Mathematics and but then changed his major to Physics. He received his bachelor's degree in 1923 and a master's in 1924. His master's thesis was on the production of hard X-rays by interaction of radium β rays with solids. From 1924 to 1926 he worked in London in the laboratory of W. H. Bragg, where he learnt the art of crystal structure analysis. In 1926 Patterson moved to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Fibrous Materials Chemistry (later the Fritz Haber Institute) in the Dahlem neighbourhood of Berlin, where he worked on the X-ray crystallography of cellulose fibres. In Berlin he had the fortune to meet the scientific elite of the time, which included Max von Laue, Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Walther Nernst, Hans Bethe, Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner and Peter Pringsheim. In 1927 he returned to McGill, finishing his work for the PhD degree in 1928. From 1933 to 1946, Patterson was a visiting researcher in the laboratory of Bertram Eugene Warren (1902–1991) at MIT. It was during this time that he published his famous function, now called the Patterson function, which subsequently developed into an extremely important theoretical tool in X-ray crystal structure analysis, especially when one or more heavy atoms are present in the structure. From 1936 to 1949, he taught at Bryn Mawr College, and from 1949 to 1966, he was a faculty member at the Institute for Cancer Research, now the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. Achievements His work led to some of the first important contributions to the theory of particle-size line broadening. In 1934, while at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he developed a method of solving crystal structures, the Patterson function, which involves the summing of the Fourier series in two and three dimensions. In addition he became concerned about the problem of uniqueness of the deconvolution of the Patterson function and was able to show that under some conditions several different atomic arrangements — homometric structures — could exist that would give the same Patterson function and therefore the same intensities in reciprocal space.

Contzen was born in 1573, or, according to Carlos Sommervogel, in 1575. Friedrich Wilhelm Bautz gives the 1571 date listed above. Contzen entered the Society of Jesus at Trier in 1595. He was professor of philosophy in the University of Würzburg in 1606, and was transferred to the University of Mainz in 1610, where he occupied the chair of Holy Scripture for more than ten years. He had a share in the organization of the University of Molsheim, in Alsace, of which he was chancellor in 1622-23. Contzen was a learned and versatile writer in theological controversy, in political economy, and in the interpretation of scriptures. He defended the controversial works of Cardinal Bellarmine against the attacks of Professor David Pareus of Heidelberg. When the latter sought to unite the Calvinists and the Lutherans against the Catholics, Contzen demonstrated the impractical nature of the project in his work, De unione et synodo Evangelicorum, and showed the only way of restoring peace to the German nation in his important work De Pace Germaniæ libri duo, priore de falsâ, alter de verâ (Mainz, 1616). This work was twice reprinted in Cologne, in 1642 and in 1685. His ideas on the restoration of peace were further developed in the works occasioned by the centenary of the Reformation, one of which, Jubilum Jubilorum, was published (1618) in Latin and German. His most interesting work, which marks him as a thinker in advance of his age, Politicorum lib. X, was published in Mainz in 1621 and 1629. The book has been called an \\"Anti-Machiavelli\\" because the author describes the ruler of a Christian commonwealth in accordance with the principals of revelation. In the questions of political and national economy which he discusses he advocates the reform of taxation, the freeing of the soil from excessive burdens, state ownership of certain industries for the purposes of revenue, indirect taxation of objects of luxury, a combination of the protective system with free trade, and state aid for popular associations. The Elector Maximilian I of Bavaria was so impressed by the ability shown in this work that he chose Contzen for his confessor. During his residence in Munich, which began in 1623, he completed and published his commentary on the four Gospels, and on the epistles of St. Paul to the Romans, the Corinthians, and the Galatians. He also wrote a political novel, Methodus doctrinæ civilis, seu Abissini regis Historia, in which he showed the practical working of his political theories.

Like other historical BC regions, it is sometimes referred to simply as The Lillooet or even Lillooet, (i.e. without meaning the town of the same name). The meaning of the name has changed since over time. During the gold rush and into the later 19th Century, the term Lillooet District was synonymous with the Lillooet Mining District and also the Lillooet Land District, which spanned east of the Fraser all the way to the North Thompson River. As development of that region proceeded the sense of \\"Lillooet District\\" for that area was abandoned, except in terms of reference to the Land District or the similarly shaped electoral district. The original Lillooet Country, or \\"Old Lillooet\\", lies in the valley of the Lillooet River, the name of which is derived from the St'at'imcets-speaking First Nations people who live there, the Lil'wat-ul. This isolated region, long dependent on Lillooet and on the old Douglas Road and Pemberton Trail routes to the outside world, continued being considered part of the Lillooet Country until after the opening of Hwy 99 from Pemberton via Squamish to North Vancouver, since which time it has slowly become more identified with the modern-era Sea to Sky Corridor. Though largely not considered as \\"part of the Lillooet Country\\" nowadays, the Lillooet River valley is the namesake and origin of the concept of the Lillooet Country. Its point-of-access in gold rush times was Port Lillooet, British Columbia, at the south end of Lillooet Lake. Also part of the Lillooet Country are the valleys between those of the Fraser and the Lillooet Rivers, namely the valleys of the Bridge River, Birkenhead River, Cayoosh Creek and Seton Lake-Anderson Lake-Gates River valley, which is the route of the Canadian National Railway (formerly PGE/BCR) through the district. The basin of the Bridge River, plus the communities of D'Arcy, McGillivray Falls, Seton Portage and Shalalth are collectively known as the Bridge River Country, which is a subarea of the Lillooet Country. After the 1930s the term \\"Bridge River-Lillooet\\" came into currency as a result of the chosen masthead of the fledgling Bridge River-Lillooet News, which served the town and environs of Lillooet as well as the mining towns of the upper Bridge River. The Lillooet Country's boundaries are loosely defined but recognizable to residents of the area. On the northeast, the edge of the Lillooet Country is marked by the summit of the Pavilion Mountain Road and the nearby eastern outlet of Marble Canyon. Down the Fraser Canyon, a spot known as the Big Slide on Highway 12, or the southern outlet of Fountain Valley, form the southwest boundary. On the northwest generally everything north to Churn Creek and Big Bar Ferry is considered to be Lillooet Country. On the west, generally the summit of Cayoosh Pass on Highway 99 near Duffey Lake is recognizable as a \\"border\\" of the \\"modern\\" meaning of the Lillooet Country. Similarly, Pemberton Pass at Birken Lake is considered to be the outer boundary of the \\"modern\\" Lillooet Country, though as noted the Lillooet River valley to its west was the historic core and namesake of the district. Similarly, the entrance to the Bridge River Country via Railroad Pass (aka Railway Pass) between the upper Hurley River and the upper valley of the Lillooet River is a recognizable regional demarcator for locals. A vague distinction is made between the Bridge River Country and \\"metropolitan Lillooet\\" such that the lower few miles of the Bridge River, being effectively part of Greater Lillooet, are considered \\"Lillooet\\", whereas above that is \\"in the Bridge River\\".

The route runs east from Maryland Route 348 (MD 348) at the Maryland border east of Sharptown, Maryland to an intersection with DE 1 in Midway, between Lewes and Rehoboth Beach. Along the way, DE 24 passes through Laurel, Millsboro, and Long Neck. DE 24 intersects U.S. Route 13 (US 13) in Laurel, US 113/DE 20 in Millsboro, and DE 5 and DE 23 in Long Neck. The route runs concurrent with DE 30 between Mission and Millsboro. DE 24 features an alternate alignment, DE 24 Alternate (DE 24 Alt.), that runs to the north of the route from US 113 in Stockley to DE 24 near Midway. DE 24 was built as a state highway throughout the 1920s, with completion of the entire route by 1931. DE 24 was assigned onto its current alignment by 1936. DE 24 Alt. was designated by 2006. Route description DE 24 eastbound approaching split with DE 30 in Millsboro DE 24 begins at the Maryland border, where the road continues west into that state as MD 348\\\\. From the state line the route heads east on two-lane undivided Sharptown Road. The road heads through agricultural areas with some woods and homes, curving to the northeast. DE 24 runs to the south of Laurel Airport and enters the town of Laurel, passing homes. Following this, the route turns north onto West Street. DE 24 curves east and becomes West Market Street, crossing the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade as it continues into the downtown of Laurel. At the Central Avenue intersection, the route becomes East Market Street and runs southeast, bending east onto East 4th Street and heading through areas of homes to the south of Records Pond. At the eastern edge of Laurel, DE 24 becomes Market Street and comes to an intersection with US 13. Past Laurel, DE 24 heads east on Laurel Road through farmland with some woodland and homes, crossing James Branch. The route then passes to the north of Trap Pond State Park. The road continues east through a mix of farms and woods with occasional residences, reaching an intersection with DE 30 in Mission. Here, DE 24 turns north to form a concurrency with DE 30 on Millsboro Highway, with the road running northeast. Farther along, residential development increases as the road crosses into the town of Millsboro. At this point the road name becomes Laurel Road as it passes homes and reaches an intersection with US 113/DE 20\\\\. Past this intersection, DE 24/DE 30 turns north-northeast on Washington Street. The two routes split into a one-way pair that heads north, following Main Street eastbound and Washington Street westbound. The road crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision line at-grade. The one- way pair heads through the downtown area of Millsboro, rejoining along two-way Main Street and crossing Indian River to the east of Millsboro Pond. A short distance later, DE 24 and DE 30 split at an intersection. Upon splitting from DE 30, DE 24 heads northeast on John J. Williams Highway, soon curving to the east. The road passes through farmland with some woods and homes, passing through a Mountaire Farms chicken plant and briefly gaining a center left-turn lane. The route continues through rural areas as a two-lane road and crosses Swan Creek and Warwick Gut, bending to the northeast and passing northwest of the Nanticoke Indian Museum before coming to an intersection with DE 5 near Oak Orchard. At this point DE 5 turns northeast to form a concurrency with DE 24\\\\. The road heads north through residential and commercial development with some fields as it enters the Long Neck area, where it intersects DE 23\\\\. Here, DE 5 splits from DE 24 by turning northwest onto DE 23, and DE 24 continues north through a mix of farms, woods, and residential neighborhoods, crossing Guinea Creek and passing the Baywood Greens golf course. The road runs through Angola and passes east of Burton Pond before it curves to the northeast, crossing Love Creek on the Eugene D. Bookhammer Bridge. The route continues northeast and intersects DE 1D/DE 24 Alt. Here, DE 1D turns northeast to join DE 24 and the two routes pass homes and businesses as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. DE 24/DE 1D becomes a four-lane undivided road and then a divided highway as it comes to its end at an intersection with DE 1 in Midway. The section of DE 24 east of US 113 serves as part of a primary hurricane evacuation route from the Oak Orchard and Long Neck areas to points inland while the section of DE 24 between US 13 and the west end of the DE 30 concurrency serves as part of a secondary hurricane evacuation route from the coastal areas. The portions of the route between Townsend Street and Delaware Avenue in Laurel and Christ Church Road and Trap Pond Road east of Laurel are designated as part of the Nanticoke Heritage Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE 24 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 34,023 vehicles at the east end of the DE 30 concurrency to a low of 1,681 vehicles at the intersection with Dickerson Road west of Laurel. None of DE 24 is part of the National Highway System. History By 1920 what is now DE 24 existed as a state highway between Mission and Phillips Hill, with the remainder of the route existing as an unimproved county road. At this time the road was under contract as a state highway between Laurel and Pepper and from Phillips Hill to east of Millsboro. The sections under contract were completed by 1924 and the remainder of present-day DE 24 was proposed as a state highway a year later. Completion of these final segments occurred by 1931. DE 24 was assigned to its current alignment between the Maryland border west of Laurel and DE 14 (now DE 1) in Midway by 1936. In 1940, a new bridge was built over Love Creek as part of improving the route east of Millsboro for traffic heading to the beaches in the summer. On April 16, 2018, the Delaware Department of Transportation unveiled plans to widen DE 24 to four lanes between the Love Creek bridge and DE 1 along with adding left turn lanes and improving intersections. This project is planned in order to improve safety and reduce traffic congestion along the road. Construction on the first phase between Mulberry Knoll Road and DE 1 is planned to begin in on March 3, 2020 and be completed in 2022. Construction on the second phase between the Love Creek bridge and Mulberry Knoll Road is planned to begin in 2021 and be finished in 2022. Major intersections Delaware Route 24 Alternate Delaware Route 24 Alternate (DE 24 Alt.) is an alternate route of DE 24 between US 113 in Stockley and DE 24 in Midway. The route heads east from US 113 on two-lane undivided Speedway Road, passing to the north of Georgetown Speedway. DE 24 Alt. reaches a roundabout with Zoar Road/Bethesda Road and heads southeast onto Zoar Road, passing through agricultural areas with some woods and homes and crossing the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision line. The road continues east through more areas of farms, woods, and residences, turning north and east before crossing DE 30 in Zoar. The route heads east- northeast through more rural areas, turning north onto Hollyville Road. DE 24 Alt. turns northeast and comes to a junction with DE 5 in Hollyville. The road continues east and intersects DE 23 in Hollymount. Here, DE 24 Alt. turns north to join DE 23 on Beaver Dam Road and the two routes continue through agricultural and wooded areas with residential developments, curving to the northeast and crossing Bundicks Branch. In Five Points the road intersects DE 1D, with DE 23 turning to the north and DE 24 Alt. continuing northeast along with DE 1D on Plantation Road. The two routes curve southeast immediately to the south of the intersection between US 9/DE 404 and DE 1 and head through a mix of farmland and residential development. Finally, the road reaches an intersection with DE 24 where DE 24 Alt. ends and DE 1D turns northeast to join DE 24. DE 24 Alt. was designated by 2006.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 6, 2007. It was written by Bill Odenkirk and directed by Lance Kramer. Plot Marge, following the advice of a parenting magazine, takes away Maggie's pacifier, leading her to destroy the inside of the Simpson home. Marge explains to Maggie that it's for her own good until Lisa reveals the magazine is by Larry Flynt Publications. The family runs out of spare pacifiers, so Marge sends Homer to buy a new one, but he cannot find the right brand, making Maggie cry. Luckily, Santa's Little Helper gives Maggie his squeaky toy, which calms her, but also makes Homer unable to sleep. He takes sleeping pills and unknowingly sleepwalks around town. Taking advantage of this situation, one night, Bart and Milhouse have Homer drive them around town. When Homer abruptly wakes up, he crashes into the Fire Department house, injuring all the firemen. As they recuperate at a hospital, Homer, Apu, Moe, and Principal Skinner become volunteer firefighters. Mayor Quimby refuses to train them beyond a standard textbook, but the new team is quite efficient. After the first few fires, despite being initially against it, they are rewarded for their efforts. This practice soon spoils the men, and when they save Mr. Burns's house and receive no reward, they feel cheated and steal some of his abundant treasures, claiming they were destroyed by the fire. From then on, they take items from the places they save and no one doubts their lie. However, Marge and the kids soon catch Homer in the act and Marge gets the kids to make sad faces around him everywhere he goes. Annoyed by this gesture, he decides to stop and convince the others to stop too after saving Moe's and Apu's lives. They then give their loot to the homeless. Cultural references The sleep medicine \\"Nappien\\" parodies two popular sleeping medicines. While the name is based on Ambien, the commercials feature a moth based on one used in similar commercials for Lunesta. The episode features numerous references to TV and film, including Forrest Gump (Mr Burns floats like the feather and music from the film plays in a scene), and Punk'd (Apu pretends he's been reincarnated as a cat, then says \\"You've been Apu'd\\"). Critical reception Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a \\"Great\\" rating of 8 out of 10. He said the \\"delightful\\" show was a return to form, and praised its \\"great pacing, fun character interactions and laugh-out-loud moments\\". He noted that \\"the story was told with several fantastic, almost stream-of-consciousness segues that smartly linked comedic segment to comedic segment\\", resulting in the removal of \\"unnecessary and unfunny filler\\" - a problem that often \\"plagued recent episodes\\". He said that Marge hadn't been the focus of many episodes at that time, so her importance to this episode was a welcome development. He concluded his review by saying \\"This was a fun, well-crafted episode that had plenty of great laughs...It's been a while since a single episode could offer up such a list of memorable moments. ‘Crook and Ladder’ might just be one of those Simpsons episodes that never gets old.\\" References External links * * Category:The Simpsons (season 18) episodes Category:2007 American television episodes ","title":"Crook and Ladder"},{"id":"10765736","text":"DIY stands for Do it yourself.

A celebrated beauty, she was the granddaughter of Sir James Long, 2nd Baronet, and of another leading civil war politician, Giles Strangways (1615–1675). She seems to have spent much of her childhood at her maternal grandparent's home at Melbury House, Dorchester, Dorset, probably due to her parents' unhappy marriage. Privately educated, she never married. Long was greatly admired by Jonathan Swift, although their relationship never had the same intensity as those Swift had with Esther Johnson and Esther Vanhomrigh.  Kit-Cat Club  Anne Long became a well-known figure in London society, possibly as early as 1703. She became a toast of the Kit-Cat Club, and Thomas Wharton, 1st Marquess of Wharton had her name engraved on the club's drinking glasses: Her closest associate was the niece of Sir Isaac Newton, Catherine Barton (d. 1739), rumoured to be the mistress of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, and later wife of politician John Conduitt. Long first met Swift in 1707 at the London home of the Vanhomrighs, whom she described in her letters to Swift, as her cousins, although their exact family relationship is unclear. 'A decree for concluding the treaty between Dr Swift and Mrs Long', was written by Swift in December 1707 or January 1708 and published by Edmund Curll in Letters, Poems and Tales: Amorous, Satyrical, and Gallant in 1718. Her position in society was financially sustained by debts contracted against an expected inheritance from her grandmother Lady Dorothy Long, née Leach, with whom she corresponded regularly, but Lady Long did not die until 1710.  Mounting debts  In September of that year Swift wrote that there were 'bailiffs in her house' and Anne Long dissolved her household in Albermarle Street, London and fled to King's Lynn, Norfolk, to hold off her creditors, where she lived incognito near St Nicholas's Chapel and passed herself off as 'being of George Smyth's family of Nitly' (Correspondence of Jonathan Swift, 1.274). Her situation was not improved at her grandmother's death, as her brother Sir James Long, 5th Baronet, withheld her legacy. Despite Anne Long's imprudence with money, Swift still held her in high regard. In his slowly and tortuously developing passion for Esther Vanhomrigh, his Vanessa, he even used her as a confidante. On one occasion, not wishing to openly offend Vanessa, he dropped a gentle hint about her behaviour by addressing a letter about her to Anne but sending it via Vanessa, conveniently forgetting to seal the enclosure; thus Vanessa would get to know what he thought about her but couldn't protest or remonstrate, since to do so she would have had to confess that she had read his private letter. After her exile to King's Lynn, Anne, in her letters to Swift, enjoyed 'describing the rituals of provincial life and the mysterious figure that she cut there' (Nokes, 142). Swift turned against her only once, writing on 11 December 1710 that 'I had a letter from Mrs. Long, that has quite turned my stomach against her: no less than two nasty jests in it with dashes to suppose them. She is corrupted in that country town with vile conversation' (Swift, Journal to Stella, 1.118–19).  Death in exile  In late 1711, by careful management of her £100 annuity and £60 rental from 'Newburg-house' in London, (Swift, Journal to Stella, 2.446) having almost paid her debts, Anne hoped to be able to leave King's Lynn. However, she had for some time suffered from asthma and dropsy, and she died in King's Lynn on 22 December. When Swift arrived in London at the Vanhomrighs' house on 25 December, for Christmas dinner, he was told the news: 'I never was more afflicted at any death – She had all sorts of amiable qualities, and no ill ones but the indiscretion of neglecting her own affairs' (ibid., 2.445–6). Swift suspected that to avoid the expense of a London funeral or public mourning, Anne's brother intended to keep her death a secret. Swift placed a notice of her death in The Post-Boy of 27 December. He also wrote to Thomas Pyle, the minister of St Nicholas's Chapel, at King's Lynn, revealing Anne's true identity and asking that she be buried in the church and that a memorial stone be placed there at Swift's own expense. Swift wrote in his account book a private commemoration of Anne Long, which was perhaps his most eloquent appreciation of her: 'She was the most beautiful Person of the Age she lived in, of great Honr and Virtue, infinite Sweetness and Generosity of Temper and true good Sense'. She figures in \\"The British Court\\", a poem published in 1707.  Further reading  *Inheriting the Earth: The Long Family's 500 Year Reign in Wiltshire; Cheryl Nicol *Hand of Fate.

He received his bachelor's degree from Queen's College in 1953, and a Master's and a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1955 and 1958 respectively. His research centered on Latin America's industrialization and economic development, especially of Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) and Brazil. Baer’s research and writing focused primarily on the areas of industrialization, growth and economic development, public policy, inflation, and income distribution and equity. He had a distinguished record of scholarly achievement, including such books as Industrialization and Economic Development in Brazil (1965), The Development of the Brazilian Steel Industry (1970) The Brazilian Economy: Its Growth and Development (1979), now in its sixth edition, as well as a lengthy stream of articles on a diverse range of economic and policy issues. One of the unique aspects of Baer's work is the link he makes between historical, social, and institutional legacies of the Brazilian past and his direct and ongoing engagement with the most current issues of economic and public policy. He served on the editorial boards of the Luso-Brazilian Review, Emerging Markets Review, Economia Aplicada, Latin American Business Review, Revista Latinoamericana de Historica Economica y Social, Revista Paraguaya de Estudios Sociologicos, Latin American Research Review, and World Development. He taught at Yale (1961–65), Vanderbilt (1965–74), and the University of Illinois (1974–2016), and he served as a program advisor for the Ford Foundation in Rio de Janeiro from 1967 to 1976. He encouraged large numbers of young people to enter Brazilian studies and recruited many, from both the United States and Brazil, to undertake doctoral studies in economics under his direction. Baer’s multiple contributions have been widely recognized in Brazil. He received the prestigious Rio Branco Medal from the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (December 2000), the Medalha de Honra da Inconfidência from the state of Minas Gerais (1995), and the National Order of the Southern Cross from the government of Brazil (1982). Carlos Alberto Braga, an economist at The World Bank, notes that not only does Baer’s analysis of Latin American economic development occupy a well-deserved place in the economic literature dedicated to the region but also that he was a highly influential thinker and researcher. This is because he was responsible for establishing one of the largest networks of those interested in the economies of Latin American. His impact on debates about Latin America’s economic experience goes well beyond his writings.Braga, Carlos A. Primo, (2006)Import Substitution Industrialization in Latin America: Experience and Lessons for the Future.

The route's western terminus is at an intersection with Maryland Route 353 (MD 353) and DE/MD 54 at the Maryland border south of Gumboro and its eastern terminus is at a dead end on the Atlantic Ocean in Bethany Beach, even though signage ends at the DE 1 intersection. The route passes through rural areas of southeastern Sussex County along with the communities of Dagsboro, Millville, Ocean View and Bethany Beach. DE 26 intersects DE 30 and DE 54 in the Gumboro area, U.S. Route 113 (US 113) and DE 20 in Dagsboro, and DE 17 west of Millville. The road was built as a state highway in various stages during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1936, DE 26 was assigned onto its current alignment. Route description DE 26 eastbound concurrent with DE 30 and DE 54 in Gumboro DE 26 begins at the Maryland border at an intersection where DE/MD 54 runs west along the state line and MD 353 continues south into Maryland. From the state line, DE 26 heads northeast on two-lane undivided Millsboro Highway concurrent with DE 54\\\\. The two routes pass through agricultural areas with some woods and homes, intersecting DE 30\\\\. At this point, DE 30 turns northeast to form a concurrency with DE 26/DE 54\\\\. The road curves north and heads into the residential community of Gumboro, where DE 54 turns to the east. DE 26/DE 30 leaves Gumboro and continues back into areas of farms and forests with occasional residences. In Shaft Ox Corner, DE 26 splits from DE 30 by turning east onto Nine Foot Road. The route continues east through rural land, crossing Whartons Branch twice and Pepper Creek before reaching an intersection with US 113\\\\. Past this intersection, the road becomes Clayton Street and enters the town of Dagsboro, passing homes and businesses and crossing the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision line at- grade. In the center of Dagsboro, DE 26 comes to an intersection with DE 20, at which point it turns south to form a concurrency with DE 20 on Main Street. The two routes cross Pepper Creek, curving east and leaving town on Vines Creek Road. Upon leaving Dagsboro, the road passes to the south of Prince George's Chapel and DE 20 splits from DE 26 by heading southeast on Armory Road. DE 26 continues east on Vines Creek Road, passing through a mix of farmland and woodland with some residential and commercial development and crossing Vines Creek. The route turns southeast and comes to the community of Clarksville, where it intersects Omar Road and curves east to become Atlantic Avenue, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. Farther along, the road comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of DE 17\\\\. After the DE 17 junction, DE 26 enters the town of Millville and runs through residential and commercial areas. The road continues east through the town of Ocean View before it crosses the Assawoman Canal into the town of Bethany Beach and becomes Garfield Parkway, passing move development and heading south of the Bethany Beach Nature Center. The road intersects the eastern terminus of DE 54 Alt. before coming to a junction with DE 1, at which point DE 26 signage ends. DE 26 officially continues east on four-lane divided Garfield Parkway through the commercial center of Bethany Beach, ending at a dead end at the Bethany Beach Boardwalk on the Atlantic Ocean. The section of DE 26 east of US 113 in Dagsboro serves as a main route to Bethany Beach and sees congestion in the summer months. DE 26 east of US 113 also serves as part of a primary hurricane evacuation route from the Bethany Beach area to points inland while the sections of the route concurrent with DE 54 and between the east end of the DE 30 concurrency and US 113 serve as part of a secondary hurricane evacuation route from the coastal areas. DE 26 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 23,217 vehicles at the western border of Millville in Ocean View to a low of 3,013 vehicles at the US 113 intersection in Dagsboro. None of DE 26 is part of the National Highway System. History By 1920, what is now DE 26 existed as an unimproved county road. The route was upgraded to a state highway between present-day US 113 and Dagsboro and from Millville to just west of the Assawoman Canal by 1924. A year later, the road was completed as a state highway between Gumboro and Mission and between Dagsboro and Vines Creek, with the route between the Maryland border and Gumboro and the incomplete sections between Dagsboro and Bethany Beach proposed as a state highway. The proposed segments were completed by 1931. In 1932, the state highway between Shaft Ox Corner and Dagsboro was completed. DE 26 was assigned to its current alignment between the Maryland border south of Gumboro and Bethany Beach, where it intersected the southern terminus of DE 14 (now part of DE 1), by 1936. In 2014, work began to widen DE 26 between Clarksville and the Assawoman Canal from a two- lane road to a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane, bike lanes, and new sidewalks in order to reduce traffic congestion. The widening project cost $57 million. On September 19, 2016, a ribbon-cutting ceremony took place to mark the completion of the project, with Governor Jack Markell, U.S. Senator Tom Carper, DelDOT Secretary Jennifer Cohan, State Senator Gerald Hocker, State Representative Ronald E. Gray, and Federal Highway Administration Division Administrator Mary Ridgeway in attendance.

Awards * The 1928 VFL Premiership team was Collingwood. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Gordon Coventry of Collingwood with 89 goals. * The winner of the 1928 Brownlow Medal was Ivor Warne-Smith of Melbourne with 8 votes. * Hawthorn took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1928. * The seconds premiership was won by for the third consecutive year. Carlton 18.18 (126) defeated 14.11 (95) in the Final, played as a stand-alone game on Thursday 27 September (Show Day holiday) at the Melbourne Cricket Ground before a crowd of 8,000. Carlton received permanent possession of the seconds premiership trophy, the Rosen Cup, as the first team to win it three times. Notable events * In Round 4, Footscray beat Geelong for the first time in its history after 26 winless matches (19 in the VFA for two draws and 17 losses and six in the VFL for six losses) over 14 years of competition (1886, 1888–1896, and 1925-1928). * One of the most unusual games was played at Corio Oval in round 6, between Fitzroy and Geelong. The game finished with Fitzroy scoring 2.27 (39): they hit the post five times, and only scored their second goal in time on of the fourth quarter. With 25 more behinds than goals, this remains the least accurate performance from any team by this metric. Geelong, on the other hand, scored 19.8 (122), giving them two fewer scoring shots than the Maroons, but they won by 83 points. As of 2020, this remains the record winning margin for a team with fewer scoring shots than their opponent. * In the round 7 match between Richmond and Geelong, played under atrocious weather conditions on a slushy, wet Punt Road Oval, Richmond players wore fingerless gloves (mittens) to help them control the slippery football. * In round 13, Collingwood finished the match with only sixteen players on the field. * On Saturday 16 June, three separate VFL combined teams played representative matches at three different locations: the first VFL team beat a Combined Ovens and Murray Football League side 16.15 (111) to 15.14 (104) at Wangaratta, Victoria, the second beat a Combined New South Wales Australian Football Association side 26.13 (169) to 14.11 (95) at the Sydney Cricket Ground, and the third drew with a Combined South Australian Football League team 13.10 (88) to 11.22 (88) in Adelaide once an incorrectly attributed behind had been deducted from Victoria's scoreboard score by the goal umpires. *In Round 17, lodged an official protest against the result of its one-point loss against , arguing that Bert Smedley's winning goal was kicked about seven seconds after the final bell had rung. The timekeepers agreed that the goal had been scored after the bell, but the protest was dismissed when the league ruled that the bell was not considered to have been rung until it was heard by the umpire. * The Second Semi-Final match between Collingwood and Melbourne finished in a draw, the first of eight draws in the history of VFL/AFL finals. A full replay was staged the following week, which was won by Collingwood. The draw meant that Richmond, who had won the First Semi-Final, endured a second consecutive bye week before the Final.

Jones is well known for having heard the \\"final prophecy\\" of Joseph Smith, namely, that Jones would fulfil a mission to Wales before he died. Early life Jones was born in Halkyn, in the county of Flintshire, north-east Wales, the sixth of Thomas Jones and Ruth Roberts's eight children. When he was sixteen years old, Jones became a sailor. On 3 January 1837, Jones married Jane Melling, a childhood friend from Halkyn. In 1840, Jones and his wife emigrated to the United States, where Jones became captain of the Ripple, a steamship on the Mississippi River. The Ripple primarily carried passengers between New Orleans and St. Louis. After the Ripple struck a rock and sank, Jones captained the Maid of Iowa, which could transport approximately 300 passengers. Conversion During his travels on the Mississippi River, Jones heard of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which had recently moved its headquarters to Nauvoo, Illinois, a city on the river. Jones sought out the Latter Day Saints to learn about the new religious movement. He believed what the missionaries told him and was subsequently baptized into the church in January 1843. The following April, Jones used the Maid of Iowa to transport approximately 300 English Latter Day Saint converts from Mississippi to Nauvoo. Jones also used his ship to haul freight required for the building of the Nauvoo Temple. Joseph Smith preached from the deck of the Maid of Iowa on more than one occasion. Joseph Smith and the \\"final prophecy\\" In June 1844, Joseph and Hyrum Smith were arrested and imprisoned in Carthage Jail. With Willard Richards and John Taylor, Jones was chosen to accompany the Smiths to jail to offer support and protection. The night before Joseph and Hyrum were killed, Joseph Smith asked Jones if he was afraid to die. Jones replied, \\"Has that time come, think you? Engaged in such a cause, I do not think that death would have many terrors.” Smith replied with what many have identified as his \\"last prophecy\\": \\"You will yet see Wales and fulfill the mission appointed you before you die.\\"Joseph Smith, B.H. Roberts (ed.) (1902), History of the Church, 6:601; Rex LeRoy Christensen, “The Life and Contributions of Captain Dan Jones,” Master’s thesis, Utah State University, 1977, p. 17. The following morning, 27 June 1844, Smith asked Jones to deliver a letter on his behalf to Orville H. Browning in Quincy, Illinois, requesting that Browning act as the Smiths' lawyer in their upcoming trial. As Jones departed the jail on horseback, bullets were fired at him, but none struck him. In his haste and panic, Jones took the wrong road to Quincy and became lost. It was later learned that a mob had been waiting to intercept him on the correct road to Quincy. When Jones finally reached Quincy later in the afternoon, he learned that Joseph and Hyrum Smith had been killed by a mob at the jail. Hanes Saint y Dyddiau Diweddaf, 1846. First mission to Wales In late 1844, Brigham Young asked Jones to return to Wales as a missionary for the church. Jones and his wife traveled to England with Wilford Woodruff and a number of other persons who had been asked to serve as missionaries in the British Isles. After approximately one year and little success, Jones was asked to preside over the missionary efforts in Wales. At this time, there were just over 200 Latter-day Saints in Wales. Under Jones's leadership, between 1845 and 1848 the missionaries in Wales baptized approximately 3600 people. In terms of population, one out of every 278 people in Wales at that time was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Gordon B. Hinckley, “The Thing of Most Worth”, Ensign, September 1993, 2. When Jones left Wales, there were seventy-two branches of the church and 4645 Latter-day Saints.Rex LeRoy Christensen, “I Have a Question: I’ve heard that a Dan Jones was one of the most successful missionaries of the early church. Can you tell me more about him?” Ensign, March 1982, p. 19. In 1846, Jones began to publish a Welsh- language periodical for the church entitled Prophwyd y Jubili—Prophet of the Jubilee. It was the first periodical to be published in a language other than English from the Church.Rex LeRoy Christensen, “The Life and Contributions of Captain Dan Jones,” Master’s thesis, Utah State University, 1977, p. 24. In 1847, Jones published the most famous of his many Welsh-language pamphlets and tracts, \\"Hanes Saint y Dyddiau Diweddaf\\" (\\"History of the Latter-day Saints\\"). Pioneer On 26 February 1849, Jones departed Wales with over 300 Welsh Latter-day Saint converts. Jones sailed from Liverpool to New Orleans on the Buena Vista and from New Orleans to Council Bluffs, Iowa by riverboat. Once Jones and the Welsh converts arrived in Council Bluffs, the church organised the first Welsh speaking branch of the church in the United States with Jones serving as the branch president. On 13 July 1849, Jones and many of his Welsh converts left Council Bluffs with other pioneers in the George A. Smith company. Jones arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on 26 October. Like many early Latter-day Saints, Jones practised plural marriage. On 8 November 1849, shortly after his arrival in the Utah Territory, Jones married his first plural wife, Elizabeth Lewis. Second mission to Wales After arriving in the Utah Territory, Jones settled in Manti and was elected mayor in 1851. However, in 1852 church president Brigham Young asked Jones to again return to Wales as a missionary. During this second mission, which lasted until 1856, Jones baptized approximately 2000 persons in Wales, most of whom eventually immigrated to Utah. In 1852, Jones oversaw the translation of the Book of Mormon into the Welsh language; it was only the third language other than English that the book had been published in (previous translations having been published in Danish and French). Jones was briefly the editor of Udgorn Seion, the church's Welsh language periodical that succeeded Jones's Prophwyd y Jubili. Later life and death Jones returned to Utah in 1856. However, upon his return he began to suffer ill health, probably partially as a result of his missionary exertions and life's extensive travels. Jones became the captain of the Timely Gull on the Great Salt Lake, a vessel that was owned by Brigham Young and used to carry salt, cedar wood, and flagstone. On 8 November 1849, Jones married a second plural wife, Elizabeth Jones Lewis, in Salt Lake City. On 18 February 1857, Jones married his third plural wife, Mary Matilda LaTrielle, in Salt Lake City. Jones' first wife, Jane, died on 24 February 1861. Less than one year later, on the 24th anniversary of his marriage to Jane, Jones died of tuberculosis at Provo, Utah Territory, at the age of fifty-one. Jones was survived by six children—two from each of his wives. His first wife gave birth to eight children that did not survive childhood. Legacy Apostle Gordon B. Hinckley has stated that Jones \\"must certainly be included in the half dozen or so most productive missionaries in the history of the Church.\\" One of the dormitories at the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah, is called the Dan Jones Building. An official publication of the church pays tribute to Jones, stating that, \\"Dan Jones, [was] one of the greatest missionaries\\" in church history.Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service (Salt Lake City, Utah: Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2002) p. 1.

Tremulis held automotive design positions at Cord Automobile, Duesenberg, General Motors, Tucker Car Corporation and Ford Motor Company before establishing a consulting firm. Early career Tremulis was the son of Greek immigrants. His parents were Antonia and Sarantos Tremulis, who came from a village near Sparta. As a 19-year-old and without any formal training in art or engineering, he landed a job on the design team for the Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg Company in 1933. Among his projects were the now famous and classic Cord 810 and 812 series, as well as a custom Duesenberg roadster having both convertible and hardtop options. In 1936, he was named Chief Stylist for Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg, and remained in that role until the company failed in 1937. Tremulis briefly worked for General Motors before moving to Briggs-Le Baron, a custom coachbuilder for Chrysler at the time. In 1938 he worked for Custom Motors in Beverly Hills, California, that made unique cars for movie stars. He was also a consultant for Crosley and American Bantam in 1939. His designs for American Bantam remained in production until the firm switched over completely to the production of military Jeeps prior to World War II. Returning to Briggs in 1939, he worked with Werner Gubitz and Howard \\"Dutch\\" Darrin to design the production versions of the Packard Clipper. He was also the creative source for the 1941 Chrysler \\"Thunderbolt\\" concept car. His contributions to these two models helped establish styling trends that would influence automobile designs after World War II. Air Corps concepts After Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, Tremulis joined the United States Army Air Forces. He worked on advanced aircraft concepts at Wright Field (now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base), and developed a concept, which in the 1960s became known as the Boeing Dyna-Soar, a gliding re-entry space vehicle. While at the Air Corps, he made the first speculative drawings of what extraterrestrial life forms would use as transportation to visit the Earth. His concept drawings were the first saucer shaped spacecraft drawings documented. Later career After the War, Tremulis worked with the design firm of Tammen & Denison until Preston Tucker hired him to design the 1948 Tucker Sedan. As Phil Egan described in his book, \\"Design and Destiny: The Making of the Tucker Automobile\\", it was Tremulis who was primarily responsible for guiding the fabrication of the \\"Tin Goose\\" to conclusion. The first production Tucker automobiles were powered by a converted Franklin helicopter engine supplied by Air Cooled Motors. Carl Doman, an engineer with Air Cooled, built a higher horsepower engine, 275 horsepower vs 166 horsepower, but was voted down by management who felt the car was fast enough with the stock powerplant. The higher horsepower engine was to be put on the shelf for a future model called the Talisman, of which both Alex Tremulis and his assistant, Phil Egan, would eventually draw up proposals for. Those designs never came to fruition. In 1957, as a Ford employee, Tremulis was assigned the task of designing the car that \\"he believed we would be driving in the year 2000\\". Tremulis drew up plans and made a clay model of the Ford X-2000, a concept that would later be brought to life in the form of a working prototype in 1999 by UK customiser Andy Saunders, who showed it at car shows in 1999 and 2000. Tremulis also designed the 1962 Ford Seattle-ite XXI concept car for the Seattle World's Fair. Tremulis left Ford in 1963 to found his own consulting firm in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Among Tremulis' last designs were the 1978 to 1987 Subaru BRAT. Tremulis served as a consultant for the 1988 film Tucker: The Man and His Dream in which he was played by Elias Koteas. He was also a frequent contributor to \\"Road & Track\\" magazine. Death Tremulis died on December 29, 1991. He was buried at Ivy Lawn Memorial Park in Ventura, California.

Unlike the indigo snake, which is dark blue to almost black, the unicolor cribo has a yellow or golden color with black facial and neck bar-like markings. This snake reaches a length of over nine feet. It is terrestrial and diurnal. It can be found in marshes, swamps, and riverbeds. The unicolor cribo is non-venomous. It bites its prey without coiling around it. It pins its prey, crushing it, and then swallows it whole. Its prey consists of other snakes, including venomous snakes, small mammals, small birds, lizards, frogs, fish, and other small vertebrate animals. References * Savage, J.M. 1992.

The route runs from River Road and Oak Orchard Avenue on the Indian River Bay in Oak Orchard north to DE 1, north of Milton. Along the way, DE 5 passes through rural areas along with the communities of Long Neck, Harbeson, and Milton. The route has concurrencies with DE 23 and DE 24 in the Long Neck area and crosses U.S. Route 9 (US 9)/DE 404 in Harbeson and DE 16 in Milton. DE 5 features one alternate route, DE 5 Alternate (DE 5 Alt.), which provides a bypass of Milton. DE 5 was built as a state highway in the 1920s and 1930s. The road between Long Neck and north of Milton, including present-day DE 5 north of DE 24, was designated as part of a short-lived DE 22 in the 1930s. DE 5 was designated to its current alignment by 1938. DE 5 Alt. was designated by 2001. Route description DE 5 northbound past US 9/DE 404 in HarbesonDE 5 heads northwest on two-lane undivided Oak Orchard Road from the intersection with River Road and Oak Orchard Avenue on the northern shore of the Indian River Bay, passing through the residential areas of Oak Orchard. The road continues through a mix of farms and woods with some housing developments, passing northeast of the Nanticoke Indian Museum before coming to an intersection with DE 24\\\\. At this point, DE 5 turns northeast to form a concurrency with DE 24 on John J. Williams Highway. The road heads north through residential and commercial development with some fields as it enters the Long Neck area, where it intersects DE 23. At the DE 23 intersection, DE 5 splits from DE 24 and turns northwest onto DE 23, which is called Indian Mission Road. The road crosses Guinea Creek and heads through a mix of farmland and woodland with some housing subdivisions. In Fairmount, DE 23 branches off to the northeast, and DE 5 continues to the northwest through more rural areas. At the intersection with DE 24 Alt. in Hollyville, the name changes to Harbeson Road. The route turns north and reaches Harbeson. In Harbeson, DE 5 heads past homes and crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Lewes Industrial Track line before it passes east of an Allen Harim Foods chicken plant and intersects US 9/DE 404 near businesses. DE 5 northbound past DE 5 Alt. in Milton Past this intersection, the road runs north through more rural land before curving northwest. The route turns north again and comes to a junction with the southern terminus of the DE 5 Alt. bypass to the west of the town of Milton, which heads west on Sand Hill Road. Also at this junction, the name changes from Harbeson Road to Federal Street. DE 5 continues northeast into Milton, encountering the Milton Rail-Trail and passing several homes. At the intersection with Front Street, the route turns northwest onto Union Street, running through the downtown and crossing the Broadkill River. The road continues through residential areas in the northern part of Milton. At the north end of town, DE 5 intersects DE 16 along with the northern terminus of DE 5 Alt., which heads west on DE 16\\\\. DE 5 continues north on Union Street Extended, passing through agricultural areas with some woods and homes. The route turns northeast and comes to its northern terminus at DE 1; this intersection has no access from northbound DE 1 to DE 5. The section of DE 5 between the southern terminus and DE 16 serves as part of a primary hurricane evacuation route from the Oak Orchard and Long Neck areas to points inland while the section of DE 5 between DE 16 and DE 1 serves as part of a secondary hurricane evacuation route from the coastal areas. The section of the route between US 9/DE 404 in Harbeson and DE 16 in Milton is designated as part of the Delaware's Bayshore Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE 5 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 19,031 vehicles at the intersection with DE 23 and DE 24 to a low of 2,260 vehicles at south end of the DE 24 concurrency. None of DE 5 is part of the National Highway System. History By 1920, what is now DE 5 existed as an unimproved county road. The road was upgraded to a state highway between Harbeson and Milton by 1924. The following year, the road was proposed as a state highway north of Milton and from Oak Orchard to the present-day north end of the DE 24 concurrency. The entire length of the present DE 5 was completed as a state highway by 1931. DE 22 was designated in 1936 to run from Long Neck north to DE 14 (now DE 1) north of Milton. DE 5 was assigned to its current alignment by 1938, running between Oak Orchard and DE 14 north of Milton. DE 5 replaced DE 22 north of the DE 24 intersection while the former DE 22 south of there became unnumbered (now a part of DE 23). By 1994, DE 23 was designated to run concurrent with a portion of DE 5 in the Long Neck area. Major intersections Delaware Route 5 Alternate Delaware Route 5 Alternate (DE 5 Alt.) is a alternate route of DE 5 that bypasses the town of Milton. The route travels west from DE 5 south of Milton along two-lane undivided Sand Hill Road through areas of farms and woods with some homes. The route turns north to join DE 30 on Gravel Hill Road, crossing an abandoned railroad grade just east of the terminus of the Delmarva Central Railroad's Milton Industrial Track line. DE 5 Alt. splits from DE 30 by turning east onto DE 16, following that route through more rural areas on Milton Ellendale Highway. The route ends at an intersection with DE 5 north of Milton. In some locations, the route is signed as \\"DE 5 Truck Alt.\\" The section of the route concurrent with DE 16 is designated as part of the Delaware's Bayshore Byway, a Delaware Byway. The route was designated in 1998 as an alternate truck route bypassing the section of DE 5 in Milton. Despite this, the route was not suited as a truck bypass, and truck traffic continued to follow DE 5 through Milton. Construction of a truck bypass along the route of DE 5 Alt. was completed in 2005 in order to reduce truck traffic along DE 5 through Milton. This project made improvements to Sand Hill Road and DE 30 to upgrade the route to a truck bypass including intersection improvements at DE 5 and Sand Hill Road and DE 30 and Sand Hill Road, reconstructing Sand Hill Road, and replacing a bridge. ;Major intersections See also * References External links * 005 Category:Transportation in Sussex County, Delaware ","title":"Delaware Route 5"},{"id":"10766378","text":"The 1999 MTV Video Music Awards (stylized as 9999 MTV Video Music Awards) aired live on September 9, 1999, honoring the best music videos from June 13, 1998, to June 11, 1999. The show was hosted by Chris Rock at Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. Lauryn Hill was the big winner of the night, taking home four Moonmen, including Best Female Video and the big one, Video of the Year Highlights of the show included Diana Ross jiggling Lil' Kim's exposed breast in response to her outfit, which left her entire left breast uncovered, but for a small pastie on her nipple.

The Beastie Boys' Adam Horovitz made a plea for peace in the wake of the sexual assaults at Woodstock '99. Near the end of the night, MTV staged a tribute to Madonna, the most-nominated artist in VMA history, by presenting a host of male drag performers dressed as the singer in her past music videos. Rapper DMX was scheduled to perform but was a no-show; as a result, Jay-Z's solo set was extended. Another moment of the ceremony was the debut of Britney Spears performing her debut single \\"...Baby One More Time\\", and then, NSYNC, performed their song \\"Tearin' Up My Heart\\". As Backstreet Boys came up and accepted their award for Viewer's Choice, a stranger came onto the stage and said, \\"Wake up at 3\\".

The concept is mainly used in inversive geometry, because straight lines and circles have very similar properties in that geometry and are best treated together. Inversive plane geometry is formulated on the plane extended by one point at infinity. A straight line is then thought of as one of the circles that passes through the asymptotic point at infinity. The fundamental transformations in inversive geometry, the inversions, have the property that they map generalized circles to generalized circles. Möbius transformations, which are compositions of inversions, inherit that property. These transformations do not necessarily map lines to lines and circles to circles: they can mix the two. Inversions come in two kinds: inversions at circles and reflections at lines. Since the two have very similar properties, we combine them and talk about inversions at generalized circles. Given any three distinct points in the extended plane, there exists precisely one generalized circle that passes through the three points. The extended plane can be identified with the sphere using a stereographic projection. The point at infinity then becomes an ordinary point on the sphere, and all generalized circles become circles on the sphere. Equation in the extended complex plane The extended plane of inversive geometry can be identified with the extended complex plane, so that equations of complex numbers can be used to describe lines, circles and inversions. A circle Γ is the set of points z in a plane that lie at radius r from a center point γ. :\\\\Gamma(\\\\gamma, r) = \\\\\\\\{ z : \\\\text{the distance between } z \\\\text{ and } \\\\gamma \\\\text{ is } r \\\\\\\\} Using the complex plane, we can treat γ as a complex number and circle Γ as a set of complex numbers. Using the property that a complex number multiplied by its conjugate gives us the square of the modulus of the number, and that its modulus is its Euclidean distance from the origin, we can express the equation for Γ as follows: :{\\\\left  z-\\\\gamma \\\\right } = r :{\\\\left  z-\\\\gamma \\\\right } ^2 = r^2 :(z-\\\\gamma)\\\\overline{(z-\\\\gamma)} = r^2 :z \\\\bar z - z \\\\bar \\\\gamma - \\\\bar z \\\\gamma + \\\\gamma \\\\bar \\\\gamma = r^2 :z \\\\bar z - z \\\\bar \\\\gamma - \\\\bar z \\\\gamma + \\\\gamma \\\\bar \\\\gamma - r^2 = 0. We can multiply this by a real constant A to get an equation of the form : A z \\\\bar z + B z + C \\\\bar z + D = 0 where A and D are real, and B and C are complex conjugates. Reversing the steps, we see that in order for this to be a circle, the radius squared must be equal to BC/A2 − D/A > 0. So the above equation defines a generalized circle whenever AD < BC. Note that when A is zero, this equation defines a straight line. The transformation w = 1/z It is now easy to see that the transformation w = 1/z maps generalized circles to generalized circles: : \\\\begin{align} A z \\\\bar z + B z + C \\\\bar z + D & = 0 \\\\[6pt] A \\\\frac{1}{w} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\bar w} + B \\\\frac{1}{w} + C \\\\frac{1}{\\\\bar w} + D & = 0 \\\\[6pt] A + B \\\\bar w + C w + D w \\\\bar w & = 0 \\\\[6pt] D \\\\bar w w + C w + B \\\\bar w + A & = 0. \\\\end{align} We see that the lines through the origin (A = D = 0) are mapped to the lines through the origin, the lines not passing through the origin (A = 0; D ≠ 0) to circles passing through the origin, circles passing through the origin (A ≠ 0; D = 0) to the lines not passing through the origin, and circles not passing through the origin (A ≠ 0; D ≠ 0) to circles not passing through the origin. Representation by Hermitian matrices The data defining the equation of a generalized circle : A z \\\\bar z + B z + C \\\\bar z + D = 0 can be usefully put into the form of an invertible hermitian matrix : \\\\mathfrak C = \\\\begin{pmatrix}A & B  C & D \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\mathfrak C ^\\\\dagger. Two such invertible hermitian matrices specify the same generalized circle if and only if they differ by a real multiple. To transform a generalized circle described by \\\\mathfrak C by the Möbius transformation \\\\mathfrak H, take the inverse \\\\mathfrak G of the transformation \\\\mathfrak H and do :\\\\mathfrak C \\\\mapsto {\\\\mathfrak G}^\\\\text{T} {\\\\mathfrak C} \\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak G}.

The rifles were manufactured entirely within the US and the company placed great emphasis on the use of fine quality materials and workmanship. The company ceased operations in the late 1980s. The largest collection of DuBiel rifles today is in the collection of the Cody Firearms Museum of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody, Wyoming. DuBiel rifles showing available stock designs. Patented DuBiel Actions  DuBiel rifles were constructed using only patented DuBiel actions which feature a five lug bolt locking mechanism resulting in a 36 degree bolt rotation. The short rotation produced the fastest bolt-action rifle available at the time. The actions were produced in three lengths, both right and left hand configurations. DuBiel rifle action. Standard Features DuBiel rifles feature Douglas premium barrels (selected contours and lengths); six hand- fitted DuBiel Stock designs (right and left); hand checkering on selected stocks; presentation recoil pads; sling swivel studs; tang safety and adjustable trigger by Canjar; side safety on thumbhole models; three bolt gas escape ports; safety designed bolt sleeve; jeweled and chromed bolt body; receiver and bolt head of 4340 steel alloy; all steel metal parts; and DuBiel actions. Unique Features The receiver portion of the action features integrally milled bases to facilitate accurate and stable scope mount installation. The streamlined bolt sleeves contain a locking bar mechanism to prevent accidental rotation when the bolt is removed from the receiver. DuBiel rifles were balanced for handling ease – the result of “total concept design”. Distinctive lever latches complement the floor plates (button releases were optional). DuBiel stock designs closely parallel the bore axis to reduce the effect of recoil. Calibers DuBiel rifles were chambered for currently standard calibers from .22-250 through .458 Win. Mag. Selected “wildcat” calibers were available at additional expense. Stock Design Stock designs available included Classic, Modern Classic, Thumbhole Modern Classic, Rollover, Thumbhole Mannlicher, and Mannlicher. Trigger pull length is standard (13-5/8 in.) or as requested. Basic price included choice of selected domestic walnut, maple, or laminated woods. Finishes were hand rubbed oil or polyvinyl epoxy. Hand-checkering is not standard on maple or laminated stocks. Special grade woods were available at additional expense. Accuracy Each and every DuBiel rifle was tested prior to delivery. Standard acceptance was a three-shot group of 1.5” at 100 yards with commercially available factory loaded ammunition. Hand loaded ammunition will produce groups of less than 1” at 100 yards.

In 1611, Champlain met Batiscan again, and the chief provided him with useful information about other tribes in the area, although he declined to provide guides for exploring the region of Saint-Maurice River. In June 1629, Champlain suggested the formation of a council of five chiefs. The proposal was approved by a general council of the Indians of the region.

Brooks, 436 U.S. 149 (1978), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States wherein the constitutionality of New York's Uniform Commercial Code provision, which allows a warehouse to enforce a lien upon repossessed goods by selling said goods, was challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court held that the state-allowed re-sale provision did not constitute state action, and thus, the plaintiff did not possess a colorable federal due process claim.  Background  After the city evicted plaintiff/appellee Shirley Brooks from her home in Mount Vernon, N.Y. in 1973, her possessions were stored in a warehouse owned by American defendant/appellant corporation Flagg Bros., Inc. After several disputes between the parties regarding the price that Brooks was to pay for the moving and storage of her belongings, Flagg Bros. presented Brooks with notice that she needed to pay the amount owed within 10 days \\"or [her furniture would] be sold.\\"436 U.S. at 153 When letters from Brooks to the defendant did not produce any results, Brooks brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking monetary damages, an injunction against the proposed sale, and a declaration by the judiciary that such a sale under New York Uniform Commercial Code § 7-210 would violate due process.  Opinion of the Court  = Rehnquist's majority opinion = Associate Justice William Rehnquist authored the majority opinion for the Court, joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger and Associate Justices Potter Stewart, Harry Blackmun, and Lewis Powell. Rehnquist began by outlining the dual burden that rested on the plaintiffs in making a viable Fourteenth Amendment claim. First, Rehnquist wrote, the plaintiffs must show that they have been deprived of a right guaranteed by the Constitution. Second, they must show that Flagg Bros. denied them of that right while acting under the color of New York state law. However, Rehnquist wrote, Brooks carried an additional burden because she was accusing Flagg Bros. of depriving her of property under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment reads, in part, that \\"[no] State [shall] deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\\" (emphasis added) Thus, according to the Court's Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, Flagg Bros. taking of Brooks' property could only rise to the level of a federal constitutional violation if Flagg Bros. was a state actor, that is, performing a duty traditionally and exclusively performed by the state, and therefore attributable to the state. Pointing out that Brooks had failed to name any governmental entity as a defendant, Rehnquist went on to argue that \\"very few\\" functions have been exclusively carried out by state governments.436 U.S. at 158. In American history, the settlement of disputes between debtors and creditors was not, in Rehnquist's view, a function performed exclusively by the state, as the parties typically retained other avenues of remedy. To Brooks' contention that the state had directly authorized the re-sale of her possessions under the UCC, Rehnquist responded that the UCC merely embodied the state's decision not to involve itself in the debtor-lendor dispute. If the state had failed to pass any law related to the re-sale, there could be no contention that the state had acted in any way. Codification of the state's intent to not involve its courts in the re-sale of repossessed goods still equated to a refusal to act. = Marshall's dissent = Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall authored a short dissenting opinion, emphasizing what he perceived as the Court's \\"attitude of callous indifference to the realities of life for the poor.\\"436 U.S. at 166. Marshall observed that, according to the record before the Court, Brooks' takehome pay was $87 per week, and thus she would be unable to pay for the surety necessary, let alone the bill that she owed to the defendant. In Marshall's view, this meant that Brooks had no realistic remedy at state law. Further, Marshall argued that New York's state traditions led to the conclusion that the execution of liens was a state function, typically performed by the sheriff. Marshall also joined Justice Stevens' dissenting opinion. = Stevens' dissent = Associate Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Associate Justices Marshall and Byron White, authored a dissent, arguing that the Court's decision was foreclosed by inconsistent prior caselaw including Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. Stevens accused the Court of adopting an overly narrow definition of state action – arguing that under the Court's reasoning, a State could pass a law stating that it would authorize, for example, \\"any person of sufficient physical power\\" to seize and retain his neighbor's property.436 U.S. at 170. Stevens noted the role of the state in defining and controlling the debtor-creditor relationship, seeing the state power in this case as the power to allow for a binding remedy against the wishes of one of the parties to the dispute.

The IUCr is a member of the International Council for Science (ICSU).  Objectives  The objectives of the IUCr are to promote international cooperation in crystallography and to contribute to all aspects of crystallography, to promote international publication of crystallographic research, to facilitate standardization of methods, units, nomenclatures and symbols, and to form a focus for the relations of crystallography to other sciences. The IUCr fulfils these objectives by publishing in print and electronically primary scientific journals through the Acta Crystallographica journal series, as well as Journal of Applied Crystallography, Journal of Synchrotron Radiation, IUCrJ, the series of reference volumes International Tables for Crystallography, distributing the quarterly IUCr Newsletter, maintaining the online World Directory/Database of Crystallographers, awarding the Ewald Prize and organising the triennial Congress and General Assembly.  History  In 1944 the yearly meeting of the X-ray Analysis Group (XRAG) of the UK Institute of Physics was held in Oxford, and the distinguished German crystallographer Paul Peter Ewald, who then taught at Queen's University Belfast, was invited to give the evening lecture. In it he gave a historical survey of some of the stages in the evolution of X-ray crystallography and ended with a strong plea for the formation of an international society or union which would represent, and unify publication for, the new science. This idea was followed up by the British crystallographers, and particularly by Sir Lawrence Bragg, the Chairman of XRAG. In June 1946, within a year of the termination of fighting in WWII, he arranged for an international meeting of crystallographers in London which was attended by some 120 scientists from most of the allied countries.With one very distinguished exception, the German physicist Max von Laue, who won the 1914 Nobel Prize for his discovery of X-ray diffraction in crystals, who's invitation and acceptance required some degree of political and personal courage by both Bragg and von Laue. In that London meeting Ewald was elected Chairman of the Provisional International Crystallographic Committee, which put into action the decision to form the International Union of Crystallography. Sir Lawrence Bragg was the first formally elected President of this IUCr, with Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff \\"Ralph W. G. Wyckoff 1897-1994,\\" Acta Crystallogr. (1995). A51, 649-650. Accessed online at http://ww1.iucr.org/people/wyckoff.htm on 3/23/2010 and Arne Westgren as Vice-Presidents. Ewald was elected as 5th President of the IUCr, the 'international society or union' that he had originally conceived, in 1960.  IUCr Symmetry notation  The IUCr notation is the notation for the symmetry group adopted by the International Union of Crystallography in 1952. It identifies members of the Wallpaper group with a 4 character name. First it has a P or C for primitive or centered groups. Groups are denoted by a number 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 for the highest order of symmetry. Groups can have one or two reflections, denoted as vertical mirrors first (horizontal reflection), and horizontal second (vertical reflection). A simple reflection is denoted by an m (mirror), and a glide-reflection is denoted by a g. Place holder 1 denotes an orthogonal direction with no reflections.

Life and work Scott's father was a linen draper. Not much else is known about her life before the publication of The Female Advocate, dedicated to her friend Anne Steele, in 1774. Scott credits John Duncombe's The Feminead (1754), a poem in praise of the accomplishments of women writers, as the inspiration for her own poem. The poem consists of 522 lines of rhyming couplets; it supplements Duncombe's, and discusses more contemporary writers. Among the poets referred to are Lucy Aikin, Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Mary Chudleigh, Sarah Fielding, Anne Killigrew, Catharine Macaulay, Catherine Parr, Helen Maria Williams, and Phillis Wheatley. Men are also praised: Duncombe; Rev. Thomas Seward, author of The Female Right to Literature, in a Letter to a Young Lady from Florence (1766); William Steele, for his support of his daughter's writing; and Richard Pulteney (1730–1801), a friend and physician who encouraged Scott. She began a correspondence with Anna Seward, whose father she had praised in The Female Advocate, and Seward's published letters are the source of much that is known of Scott's life. In the preface the Advocate, Scott mentions ongoing ill-health and indeed seems to have been a semi-invalid. She lived with her parents until she was in her thirties, caring for her ailing mother until she died in 1787. Her father died in 1788, and Scott was free after over a decade of courtship to marry John Taylor, a match her mother had opposed when alive. Scott was part of a circle of Protestant dissenters and was deeply religious; consequently, when her husband, who had formerly convinced her to convert to Unitarianism, embraced Quakerism, she underwent considerable strain. Scott gave birth to a daughter in 1789 and a son in 1791 (her son, John Edward Taylor, went on to found the Manchester Guardian). She died late in her third pregnancy, in 1793, at the age of forty-one.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 20, 2007 as part of the one-hour season finale, alongside the episode \\"24 Minutes\\". It was the milestone 400th episode of The Simpsons and was written by Tim Long. The episode guest starred Ludacris as himself and Maurice LaMarche as the Fox announcer. It was the last episode to air prior to The Simpsons Movie, which was released two months later on July 27, 2007. Special opening In celebration of the 20th anniversary of the show (when counting the shorts), the entire opening sequence is replaced with a black screen that reads, \\"20 Years Ago...\\" followed by a showing of The Tracey Ullman Show Simpsons short \\"Family Portrait\\". Plot Driving home after a trip to the dentist, Homer takes the Simpson family to an ice cream parlor, where he buys the store's millionth ice cream cone. This results in Homer appearing on Kent Brockman's TV news talk show Smartline on Channel 6. Kent is disgusted that he is forced to do a fluff piece instead of an in-depth, intellectually stimulating discussion of the conflict in the Middle East. During the interview, Homer accidentally knocks Kent's cup of coffee into his lap, making him swear in pain. After the commercial break, Kent apologizes, but is relieved to find that no one saw his on-air faux pas. However, Ned Flanders reviews the incident and gets people of alike minds to report it to the Federal Communications Commission. The next day, during the newscast, Kent finds out that he is under scrutiny for his indiscretion and that the station has been fined $10 million. He is demoted to weekend weatherman with his rival, Arnie Pye, as the new anchorman. Later, Lindsey Naegle speaks to Kent, assuring him that his job is safe, but fires him after she sees what she thinks is cocaine in his coffee cup, ignoring his insistence that it is actually Splenda. Marge invites a suicidal Kent to sleep over at the Simpson house. While watching TV the next day, Lisa wonders why the cable channel Fox News can be so conservative while the Fox Network broadcasts sexualized content. Kent replies that Fox deliberately airs programs with morally reprehensible content so that they will be fined by the FCC, with the fines being funneled to the Republican Party. According to Brockman, everyone in the entertainment business knows this, but no one is brave enough to report the scam. Lisa goads him into blowing the whistle on the scam, using her web camera and uploading the revelation onto YouTube. Kent's subsequent webcast is so successful that Springfield's Republican Party members are less than thrilled about Kent threatening their ill-gotten gains, so Naegle and Krusty the Clown hatch a plan to stop him. The next day, Lisa and Kent are confronted by the party members, who offer him his old job back with a 50% raise, which Kent accepts instantly, before apologizing to Lisa. At home, Lisa complains to Homer that today's media figures have no bravery or integrity. Homer consoles her by telling a horrifying secret that Kent told him about the Fox network, only for all references to the secret to be reduced with an announcer praising the network's programming. Homer then tries to tell the secret to the show's audience, only to be cut off by the 20th Century Fox Television logo. He then tries again only to be cut off by the Gracie Films logo.

It consists of a set Q of states, a set Σ called the input alphabet, and a function T: Q × Σ → Q called the transition function. Associated with any semiautomaton is a monoid called the characteristic monoid, input monoid, transition monoid or transition system of the semiautomaton, which acts on the set of states Q. This may be viewed either as an action of the free monoid of strings in the input alphabet Σ, or as the induced transformation semigroup of Q. In older books like Clifford and Preston (1967) S-acts are called \\"operands\\". Transformation semigroups and monoid acts : A transformation semigroup or transformation monoid is a pair (M,Q) consisting of a set Q (often called the \\"set of states\\") and a semigroup or monoid M of functions, or \\"transformations\\", mapping Q to itself. They are functions in the sense that every element m of M is a map m\\\\colon Q\\\\to Q. If s and t are two functions of the transformation semigroup, their semigroup product is defined as their function composition (st)(q)=(s\\\\circ t)(q)=s(t(q)). Some authors regard \\"semigroup\\" and \\"monoid\\" as synonyms. Here a semigroup need not have an identity element; a monoid is a semigroup with an identity element (also called \\"unit\\"). Since the notion of functions acting on a set always includes the notion of an identity function, which when applied to the set does nothing, a transformation semigroup can be made into a monoid by adding the identity function. =M-acts= Let M be a monoid and Q be a non-empty set. If there exists a multiplicative operation :\\\\mu\\\\colon Q\\\\times M \\\\to Q :(q,m)\\\\mapsto qm=\\\\mu(q,m) which satisfies the properties :q1=q for 1 the unit of the monoid, and :q(st)=(qs)t for all q\\\\in Q and s,t\\\\in M, then the triple (Q,M,\\\\mu) is called a right M-act or simply a right act. In long-hand, \\\\mu is the right multiplication of elements of Q by elements of M. The right act is often written as Q_M. A left act is defined similarly, with :\\\\mu\\\\colon M\\\\times Q \\\\to Q :(m,q)\\\\mapsto mq=\\\\mu(m,q) and is often denoted as \\\\,_MQ. An M-act is closely related to a transformation monoid. However the elements of M need not be functions per se, they are just elements of some monoid. Therefore, one must demand that the action of \\\\mu be consistent with multiplication in the monoid (i.e. \\\\mu(q, st)=\\\\mu(\\\\mu(q,s),t)), as, in general, this might not hold for some arbitrary \\\\mu, in the way that it does for function composition. Once one makes this demand, it is completely safe to drop all parenthesis, as the monoid product and the action of the monoid on the set are completely associative. In particular, this allows elements of the monoid to be represented as strings of letters, in the computer-science sense of the word \\"string\\". This abstraction then allows one to talk about string operations in general, and eventually leads to the concept of formal languages as being composed of strings of letters. Another difference between an M-act and a transformation monoid is that for an M-act Q, two distinct elements of the monoid may determine the same transformation of Q. If we demand that this does not happen, then an M-act is essentially the same as a transformation monoid. =M-homomorphism= For two M-acts Q_M and B_M sharing the same monoid M, an M-homomorphism f\\\\colon Q_M\\\\to B_M is a map f\\\\colon Q \\\\to B such that :f(qm)=f(q)m for all q\\\\in Q and m\\\\in M. The set of all M-homomorphisms is commonly written as \\\\mathrm{Hom}(Q_M, B_M) or \\\\mathrm{Hom}_M(Q, B). The M-acts and M-homomorphisms together form a category called M-Act. Semiautomata A semiautomaton is a triple (Q,\\\\Sigma,T) where \\\\Sigma is a non-empty set, called the input alphabet, Q is a non-empty set, called the set of states, and T is the transition function :T\\\\colon Q\\\\times \\\\Sigma \\\\to Q. When the set of states Q is a finite set—it need not be—, a semiautomaton may be thought of as a deterministic finite automaton (Q,\\\\Sigma,T,q_0,A), but without the initial state q_0 or set of accept states A. Alternately, it is a finite state machine that has no output, and only an input. Any semiautomaton induces an act of a monoid in the following way. Let \\\\Sigma^* be the free monoid generated by the alphabet \\\\Sigma (so that the superscript * is understood to be the Kleene star); it is the set of all finite-length strings composed of the letters in \\\\Sigma. For every word w in \\\\Sigma^*, let T_w\\\\colon Q\\\\to Q be the function, defined recursively, as follows, for all q in Q: * If w=\\\\varepsilon, then T_\\\\varepsilon(q)=q, so that the empty word \\\\varepsilon does not change the state. * If w=\\\\sigma is a letter in \\\\Sigma, then T_\\\\sigma(q)=T(q,\\\\sigma). * If w=\\\\sigma v for \\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\Sigma and v\\\\in \\\\Sigma^*, then T_w(q)=T_v(T_\\\\sigma(q)). Let M(Q,\\\\Sigma,T) be the set :M(Q,\\\\Sigma,T)=\\\\\\\\{T_w \\\\vert w\\\\in\\\\Sigma^* \\\\\\\\}. The set M(Q,\\\\Sigma,T) is closed under function composition; that is, for all v,w\\\\in\\\\Sigma^*, one has T_w\\\\circ T_v=T_{vw}. It also contains T_\\\\varepsilon, which is the identity function on Q. Since function composition is associative, the set M(Q,\\\\Sigma,T) is a monoid: it is called the input monoid, characteristic monoid, characteristic semigroup or transition monoid of the semiautomaton (Q,\\\\Sigma,T). Properties If the set of states Q is finite, then the transition functions are commonly represented as state transition tables. The structure of all possible transitions driven by strings in the free monoid has a graphical depiction as a de Bruijn graph. The set of states Q need not be finite, or even countable. As an example, semiautomata underpin the concept of quantum finite automata. There, the set of states Q are given by the complex projective space \\\\mathbb{C}P^n, and individual states are referred to as n-state qubits. State transitions are given by unitary n×n matrices. The input alphabet \\\\Sigma remains finite, and other typical concerns of automata theory remain in play. Thus, the quantum semiautomaton may be simply defined as the triple (\\\\mathbb{C}P^n,\\\\Sigma,\\\\\\\\{U_{\\\\sigma_1},U_{\\\\sigma_2},\\\\dotsc,U_{\\\\sigma_p},\\\\\\\\}) when the alphabet \\\\Sigma has p letters, so that there is one unitary matrix U_\\\\sigma for each letter \\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\Sigma. Stated in this way, the quantum semiautomaton has many geometrical generalizations. Thus, for example, one may take a Riemannian symmetric space in place of \\\\mathbb{C}P^n, and selections from its group of isometries as transition functions. The syntactic monoid of a formal language is isomorphic to the transition monoid of the minimal automaton accepting the language. References * A. H. Clifford and G. B.

Roosevelt's Court Packing Bill. The Committee opposed most, if not all, of the New Deal legislation. Founders of the Committee were Frank Gannett, Amos Pinchot and Edward Rumely. The organization enjoyed considerable success in opposing the Bill, also because of large mailing list campaign targeted at legal professionals. Pinchot would later lead an America First chapter in New York City, although the committee itself was silent on the foreign policies of Roosevelt, and included many interventionists as its members. Gannett would become a presidential candidate in 1940. Other people associated with the Committee were U.S. Representative Samuel B. Pettengill, John M. Pratt, Ralph W. Gwinn, John T. Flynn and Robert E. Wood. The Committee was thrice investigated by Congress for suspected lobbying activities. Most notably, Rumely was twice indicted for Contempt of Congress. In 1946, he was acquitted in the second Congressional investigation. In 1953, he was cleared in the third Congressional investigation, a case he pleaded all the way to the United States Supreme Court on appeal. See also * Merwin K.

They depose Reza Shah whom they consider too sympathetic to the Axis powers, and they exile him to South Africa. His son Mohammad Reza becomes the new Pahlavi Shah of Iran. He was very happy about this Mackey Iranians (1996), p.185 1953 * August: Shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, who had resisted for months despite British and American calls for him to dismiss Prime Minister Mohammed Mossaddegh, gets nervous about the popular nationalist prime minister's designs when Mossadegh dissolved the parliament and began rule by decree. As a result, the Shah dismisses Mossadegh as prime minister. But Mossadegh refused to step down and instead arrested the royal messenger delivering the dismissal order. In a panic, the Shah flees to Italy. CIA and British intelligence initiate and execute \\"Operation Ajax\\" with conservative Iranians to overthrow Mossadegh. Shah returns to Iran.Mackey Iranians (1996), p.206 1961 * March 31: Husain Borujerdi, the prominent Marja of all Shi'a, dies. Khomeini emerges as one of the probable successors to Boroujerdi's position of leadership. This emergence was signaled by the publication of some of his writings on fiqh, most importantly the basic handbook of religious practice entitled, like others of its genre, Tozih al-Masael. He was soon accepted as Marja-e Taqlid (source of imitation) by a large number of Iranian Shi'is.Ayatollah Khomeini In this year his students, who were the teachers of seminary, established Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom, which played key role during establishment of new government after victory of revolution. 1962 * October–November: Khomeini organizes opposition to the Shah's Local council election bill. The Bill introduced by Shah's government allows women to vote for the first time and non-Muslims to run for councils. Religious pressure forces government to back down completely and abandon the bill. Khomeini emerges from fight as \\"the regime's principal political foe\\" and \\"undisputed spiritual leader of ... bazaari activists.\\"Moin Khomeini (2010), p.81 1963 * January: Mohammad Reza Pahlavi proposes \\"White Revolution\\". The government introduces a six-point reform bill to be put to a nationwide referendum vote. Six points also included Women's suffrage, as well as other reforms. Khomeini summoned a meeting of his colleagues in Qom to press upon them the necessity of opposing the Shah's plans. * January 22: Khomeini issued a strongly worded declaration denouncing the Shah and his plans. Two days later Shah took armored column to Qom, and he delivered a speech harshly attacking the ulama. Khomeini continues his denunciation of the Shah's programs, issuing a manifesto that also bore the signatures of eight other senior scholars. In it he listed the various ways in which the Shah had violated the constitution, condemned the spread of moral corruption in the country, and accused the Shah of comprehensive submission to America and Israel. He also decrees that the Norouz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 be canceled as a sign of protest against government policies. Escalating antipathy between Shah and Ayatollah climaxes in June with drawing parallels between the Umayyad Caliph Yazid I and the Shah and warns the Shah that if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country. * January 24: Shah orders to arrest Khomeini two days later, and major protest riots in cities over Iran the day after that which is called Movement of 15 Khordad. Martial law is declared and hundreds are killed.Moin Khomeini (2000), p.102-112 After nineteen days in the Qasr prison, Ayatollah Khomeini was moved first to the 'Eshratabad' military base and then to a house in the 'Davoudiyeh' section of Tehran where he is kept under surveillance. 1964 * April 7: Khomeini is released from custody and returns to Qom. In autumn he denounces \\"capitulations\\" (the government's underhanded extending of diplomatic immunity to American military personnel), and calls the agreement as surrender of Iranian independence and sovereignty, made in exchange for a $200 million loan that would be of benefit only to the Shah and his associates, and describes all those in the Majlis who voted in favor of it as traitors, concluding that the government is illegitimate. He is arrested immediately and taken to Mehrabad Airport in Tehran. He's exiled in November, and does not return to Iran for 15 years.Moin Khomeini (2000), p.119-127 1965 * 10am January 22: Hassan-Ali Mansur, the prime minister, who passed the Geneva Convention American Force Protection Act, also known as \\"Capitulation Law\\" is assassinated by Mohammad Bokharaii and Amir Abbas Hoveyda is appointed in his stead. * September 5: Khomeini leaves Turkey for Najaf in Iraq, where he was destined to spend 13 years. He teaches in seminary during this time. 1970 *January 21-February 8: Khomeini gives a series of nineteen lectures to a group of his Talaba (students) on Islamic Government while he was in exile in Iraq in the holy city of Najaf. Notes of the lectures were soon made into a book that appeared under three different titles: The Islamic Government, Authority of the Jurist, and A Letter from Imam Musavi Kashef al-QitaDabashi, Theology of Discontent, (1993), p.437 (to deceive Iranian censors). The small book (fewer than 150 pages) was smuggled into Iran and \\"widely distributed\\" to Khomeini supporters before the revolution.Moin, Khomeini, (2000), p.157 1975 * March 2: Rastakhiz (Resurrection) party as an Iranian monarchist party is founded by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. * June 1975: Anniversary of the uprising of 15 Khordad. Students at the Feyziyeh madreseh hold a demonstration within the confines of the building, and a sympathetic crowd assembles outside. Both gatherings continues for three days until they are attacked by military forces, resulting in some casualties. Khomeini reacts with a message in which he declares the events in Qom and similar disturbances elsewhere to be a sign of hope that \\"freedom and liberation from the bonds of imperialism\\" is at hand. 1977 *October 23: Mostafa Khomeini, the son of Ayatollah Khomeini, died while the family lived in Najaf. His death led to unfounded rumors of foul play by Shah’s regime and became the subject of a \\"martyrdom\\" by opponents of Shah’s government, and would fuel the growing discontent with the Shah that eventually led to the Iranian Revolution. 1978 Jaleh Square shooting in Tehran, 8 September 1978 Khomeini demonstration in Tehran 1978 * January 7: An article in the Ettela'at newspaper by the Information Minister Daryoush Homayoun, titled \\"Black and Red Imperialism\\" accuses Khomeini of homosexuality and other \\"misdeeds\\".Moin Khomeini (2000), p.186-7Abrahamian Iran (1983), p.505Keddie Modern Iran (2003) p.225 Later in his book, Hun claimed that this was done on the Shah's order.داریوش همایون، گذار از تاریخ، ص30 * January 9: Demonstration of 4,000 students and religious leaders in the city of Qom against the article.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on March 10, 1956, and stars Daffy Duck and Porky Pig as futuristic space cops who patrol the Milky Way Galaxy. Plot In this futuristic setting, Daffy Duck is Sgt. Joe Monday and narrator of the story. His partner, Det. Schmoe Tuesday (Porky Pig), and himself are returning from a routine investigation of a 712-malicious mischief ('School children blew one of the rings off of Saturn. When will parents learn to keep uranium out of their children's reach?') in the Big Dipper area, when they receive a call from the police chief. They return to headquarters and await the police chief's call ('10:52: Back at the old desk, waiting for a call from the Chief. Half a cop's life is spent in waiting. 10:53: the Chief called.'). The police chief is down on his knees as he practically begs Daffy to pursue the Flying Saucer Bandit. Daffy consents to take the case, and the police chief kisses his feet. Sgt. Monday and Det. Tuesday then report to the scene of the crime. The crime robots are already there picking up clues to aid Daffy and Porky in their ability to identify the Flying Saucer Bandit. They return to the station with a bag of clues, and empty them into the Univac clue machine, which pops out what appears to be a computer punch card. The punch card is loaded into a player piano, which plays out the song \\"Mother Machree\\", identified by Daffy. They proceed to the George 'Mother' Machree file where they begin their pursuit of the Flying Saucer Bandit. Daffy describes him as \\"A criminal so clever, he had never been suspected of anything!\\" They learn that the Flying Saucer Bandit is at a restaurant ordering a sandwich, to which they hurry because he is known as a 'notoriously fast eater'. Upon arriving, they realize they have missed the bandit, and continue their chase ('1:07: He left the Blast-Inn. 1:08: We arrived at the Blast-Inn. Our deductions later proved that we had missed him by one minute. 1:09: We set out in pursuit.'). Porky and Daffy are in hot pursuit of 'Mother' Machree when they lose him in a smog bank over Los Angeles. Porky points out a smog cloud flying away, when they pull up and tell Machree to come out, to which Daffy mentions that he has an elaborate alibi already cooked up:\\"I didn't do nothin'!\\". It turns out that Machree is innocent, evident by his confession. Because of this, Daffy and Porky are sentenced by the Ultra Superior Court to twenty years in prison for false arrest (thirty years actually, as Porky states so afterwards). Production notes Rocket Squad is a futuristic parody of the television shows Dragnet and Racket Squad. Daffy and Porky's characters first names put together are 'Joe Schmoe' (Sgt. Joe Monday and Det. Schmoe Tuesday (\\"He always follows me,\\" declares Joe.) Much of the imagery, particularly entering the police station and the evaporators, is reused from Jones' previous short, Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century. Among the names appearing on the buttons of the Criminal Detector Set are John Burton Jr., Tedd Pierce, C.M. Jones, Mel Blanc, Norman Moray and Eddie Selzer, all of whom had a hand in the making of the cartoon (Moray was a key executive with The Vitaphone Corporation, Warner Bros'. short-subject division). Porky and Daffy losing the Flying Saucer Bandit in a smog bank over Los Angeles is in reference to Los Angeles being considered the Smog Bank Capital of the world in the early to late 1950s. This cartoon has been shown (in clips) on the PBS special Chuck Jones: Extremes and Inbetweens—A Life in Animation as part of the section about Jones using Porky and Daffy in cartoon shorts that parody popular movie and TV show genres of the era.

Lightning strikes derived from this process are called \\"triggered lightning.\\"  Design  A conducting lightning rod which is grounded and positioned alongside the launch tube in communication with the conductive path to thereby control the time and location of a lightning strike from the thundercloud. The conductor trailed by the rocket can be either a physical wire, or column of ionized gas produced by the engine. A lightning rocket using solid propellant may have cesium salts added, which produces a conductive path when the exhaust gases are discharged from the rocket. In a liquid propellant rocket a solution of calcium chloride is used to form the conductive path. The system consists of a specially designed launch pad with lightning rods and conductors attached. The launch pad is either controlled wirelessly or via pneumatic line to the control station to prevent the discharge traveling to the control equipment. The fine copper wire (more recently reinforced with kevlar) is attached to the ground and plays out from the rocket as it ascends. The initial strike follows this wire and is as a result unusually straight. As the wire is vaporized by the initial strike, subsequent strikes are more angular in nature and follow the ionization trail of the initial strike. Rockets of this type are used for both lightning research and lightning control.  Betts system  The Betts lightning rocket, patented by Robert E. Betts in 2003, consists of a rocket launcher that is in communication with a detection device that measures the presence of electrostatic and ionic change in close proximity to the rocket launcher that also fires the rocket. This system is designed to control the time and the location of a lightning strike. As the rocket flies to the thundercloud this liquid is expelled aft forming a column in the air of particles that are more electrically conductive than the surrounding air. In a similar fashion to the system employing a solid propellant as the conductive producer this conductive path conducts a lightning strike to ground to thereby control the time and location of a lightning strike from the thundercloud.

Origins WASU was founded on 7 August 1925 by twenty-one law students, led by Ladipo Solanke and Herbert Bankole-Bright.\\"History of West African Students' Union (WASU)\\", West African Students' Union Solanke had founded the Nigerian Progress Union (NPU), for London-based students with a Nigerian background, the previous year. With the support of Amy Ashwood Garvey, it had begun to campaign for improved welfare for all African students in London, and for assorted measures for progress in Britain's African colonies.Hakim Adi, West Africans in Britain 1900–1960: Nationalism, Pan- Africanism and Communism, London: Lawrence & Wishart, 1998. . As early as 1923, Solanke had proposed that the Union of Students of African Descent (USAD), a Christian social organisation dominated by students from the West Indies (and which had grown out of the earlier West African and West Indian Christian Union, founded in 1917),David Killingray, \\"West African Students in Britain, 1900–60\\" in Africans in Britain (first published Frank Cass, 1994), Routledge, 2012, p. 113. should incorporate itself into the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA). In 1925, Bankole-Bright of the NCBWA called on USAD, the NPU, the African Progress Union and the Gold Coast Students Association to join together to form a single organisation for West African students, inspired by the Indian Students' Union. Many students joined together to form WASU, and Solanke became the new organisation's secretary- general, while J. B. Danquah became its first president. J. E. Casely Hayford was the new grouping's first patron, which post he used to promote African nationalism. The new organisation made opposition to the colour bar its first priority, while also including the promotion of political research, support for the NCBWA and the provision of a student hostel in its founding aims. WASU began publication of a journal, Wasu, in March 1926. Solanke and Julius Ojo- Cole wrote the majority of articles in what was intended as a scholarly publication, circulated both in Europe and Africa. The aim of founding a hostel was taken directly from USAD and the NPU. Many African students in Britain found that, due to racism, it was difficult to secure satisfactory lodgings. While the Colonial Office showed some interest in establishing such a hostel, WASU was keen to maintain control of the project, and in 1929, Solanke left for a fundraising journey through West Africa. Despite this, the Colonial Office assembled a secret committee to plan for a hostel under its control, and attempted to secure private funding for its construction. This became Aggrey House, which WASU exposed in their pamphlet The Truth About Aggrey House – An Exposure of the Government Plan to Control African Students in Great Britain. WASU also undertook some political campaigns within Britain. In 1929, it successfully stopped plans for an African village exhibition in Newcastle, which it felt would be exploitative. This campaign was taken up in Parliament by Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) Member of Parliament Shapurji Saklatvala. During the 1930s, the group developed increasing links with communist groups, such as the League Against Imperialism (LAI) and the Negro Welfare Association, in particular in its campaigns against the colour bar and against the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. While in Africa, Solanke founded more than twenty branches of WASU, in the Gold Coast, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and the Belgian Congo. While these organisations were short-lived, they formed the initial membership of the Nigerian Youth Movement and the Gold Coast Youth Conference. Activities in the 1930s By 1932, when Solanke returned to Britain, Wasu had ceased to appear, and membership had fallen amid disputes between Nigerian and Gold Coast members. However, he had raised sufficient funds to open a hostel in Camden in March 1933 named \\"Africa House\\". In addition to providing accommodation for students, the hostel also offered rooms to West African visitors to London, and it housed reference materials on West Africa. The new hostel did nothing to settle the disputes within WASU, and Solanke was accused of wasting money while in Africa, and of attempting to personally control the new lodgings. Almost all the Gold Coast Students' Association (GCSA) members left WASU, and even an intervention by William Ofori Atta was unable to settle matters. The Colonial Office determined to open a rival hostel, at which political discussion could be monitored and discouraged. WASU opposed the scheme, and formed an \\"Africa House Defence Committee\\", including Reginald Bridgeman of the LAI, also gaining the support of the National Council for Civil Liberties and Paul Robeson, who was awarded the title \\"Babasale of the Union\\". Aggrey House opened in October 1934, but a WASU-led boycott left it unfilled,\\"West African Students Union (WASU)\\", in Carole Boyce Davies (ed.), Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture, Vol. 3, ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 978. until the Colonial Office offered WASU official recognition and financial support to run Africa House. In financial difficulties, WASU accepted the deal, and also accepted funding from organisations such as the United African Company. In 1937, the Gold Coast Farmers Union wrote to Solanke, asking for his assistance in breaking the cocoa cartel of Cadbury's and the UAC. With Labour Party MPs Reginald Sorensen and Arthur Creech Jones, WASU campaigned in support of the 1938 Gold Coast cocoa hold-up, where small farmers attempted to pressurise the companies by disrupting their supplies. The campaign also convinced most members of the GCSA to rejoin WASU. In July 1938, with grants from various West African governments and British companies, WASU opened a new hostel, on Camden Square. This also solved the union's financial problems, and enabled it to step up its campaigning activity. WASU became increasingly identified as an anti-colonial group, and it called for dominion status and universal suffrage for the West African colonies. Clement Attlee gave a speech to the union in which he suggested that the Atlantic Charter would apply to all nations, effectively endorsing WASU's aims, but Winston Churchill insisted that self-determination could only apply to European nations. Activities in the 1940s In 1942, WASU organised a \\"West African Parliamentary Committee\\", chaired by Sorensen. It also published a call for the immediate internal self-government of Britain's West African colonies, to be followed by independence within five years of the end of the war. Harold Macmillan personally visited Africa House to argue the British government's case. WASU's influence in West Africa again increased, with both the Nigerian Union of Students and the Sierra Leone Students' Union affiliating. WASU also represented the Nigeria Union of Teachers within the UK. With its links to the Nigerian trade union movement, WASU was a significant supporter of the Nigerian general strike in 1945. In the mid-1940s, Solanke returned to West Africa to undertake further fundraising, with H. O. Davies becoming acting Secretary-General. WASU also affiliated to the World Youth Movement, and in 1946 it held a joint conference with Kwame Nkrumah's West African National Secretariat. This event agreed a platform of anti-imperialism and socialism. Nkrumah also became Vice President of WASU.Microsoft Encarta, \\"Kwame Nkrumah\\" The following year, WASU called for an immediate decision on independence for the West African colonies, and criticised the Labour government for its failure to deliver this. Final years Solanke returned from West Africa at the end of the decade, with sufficient funding for a new hostel to open on the Chelsea Embankment. However, he fell out with WASU's executive, each accusing the other of excessive expenditure, and in 1949 he stepped down from his positions in the group. In the 1951 elections to WASU's executive, he organised an anti- communist slate, which failed to take control from the largely communist leadership of Joe Appiah and Ade Ademola. In 1952, WASU determined to close their Camden hostel, but Solanke instead took control of it. WASU affiliated to the International Union of Students (IUS) on its foundation, and its members regularly attended the World Festival of Youth. Although the National Union of Students of the United Kingdom left the IUS in 1952, WASU retained its membership. In 1952, WASU began publication of WASU News Service, as an openly Marxist replacement for Wasu. Following further financial problems, it sold its hostel on the Chelsea Embankment and opened cheaper premises on Warrington Crescent in 1956. The same year, it underwent a major reorganisation and passed a motion disassociating it from all political organisations. In 1958, it joined the Committee of African Organisations and lost importance, but it remained active into the early 1960s. The National Union of Nigerian Students was one of the organisations set up in the wake of the demise of WASU. Legacy In 2004 a new West African Students' Union based in Ghana was founded to unite students' unions throughout the region. It describes itself as a formal resuscitation of the earlier organisation. Also inspired by the original West African Students’ Union, The WASU Project aims to document the history of West Africans in Britain, especially those who campaigned for an end to colonial rule and against all forms of racism during the 20th century, by presenting information, photos, and eventually a film about WASU.\\"Introduction\\", The WASU Project.

Released in 1972 by all the initial members of the group, it is considered their breakthrough album that put them on the map. The album remains popular among progressive rock fans throughout Italy and the group will usually still perform all tracks on the album today. The album, still progressive at heart, additionally borrows influences from a variety of rock genres and subgenres. In an Allmusic review, Per un amico was lauded as a classic within the genre and deemed par to the work of the biggest progressive rock acts of the 1970s. Many of the songs from this album would appear either in their original form or re-recorded with vocals in English on PFM's English-language album Photos of Ghosts.  Composition and critical reception  Per un amico is rooted within the progressive rock genre, yet includes elements of music ranging from avant-garde to hard rock. The lyrics in the album are also sung in Italian. Robert Taylor, in an Allmusic review, gave the album a four-and-a-half stars out of five and a positive review. Deeming it, along with its predecessor, as a classic, he claimed that it was as fine as the music of major groups such as Genesis, Yes, or King Crimson, and concluded by saying \\"Always intelligent, but without pretension, this is progressive rock in its most literal definition\\".

Two former treasurers and two former leaders of the Oslo chapter were found guilty of fraud, and given prison sentences, for having unlawfully received in grants from the City of Oslo between 1992 and 1994. The convicted were Ragnar Bøe Elgsaas, Anders Hornslien, Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen and Anders Greif Mathisen. Anders Mathisen's sentence was suspended. Background On 2 March 1995, the newspaper Verdens Gang revealed that AUF's Oslo branch had artificially inflated their membership numbers from 1992 to 1994, and as a result received NOK 600,000 more than they were entitled to in government grants. For each new member recruited, AUF received nearly NOK 300 from the Oslo City Council. The yearly membership fee was at the time NOK 30. The City of Oslo was the subject of the fraud The scam was accomplished by transferring money from AUF's main bank account into AUF-treasurer Bjørn Jarle Røberg-Larsen's private bank account, from which he then transferred money back into AUF's account to pay for new members. By doing this, AUF's membership was inflated by 2,300 between 1992 and 1994, AUF obtained more than NOK 600.000 from government funds. Investigation On 7 March 1995, five days after the case became public the Oslo administration started an investigation into the matter. On 11 March, the leader of Oslo AUF, Ragnar Bøe Elgsaas, submitted a report to the City Council, in which he admitted to inflating the membership numbers submitted to city, and that they had later received increased grants based upon these incorrect numbers. In his report, Elgsaas referred to this practice as 'advancing' money to pay for membership fees for people whom AUF had reason to believe wanted to become members, or renew their memberships with the party. The same day as he pleaded guilty, he resigned from his position as leader of Oslo AUF. On 14 March, former leaders of AUF, Jens Stoltenberg, the Deputy Leader of the Norwegian Labour Party at that time, and Turid Birkeland, admitted that the lying about AUF's total membership to pay for membership fees had become a common and accepted practice. On 16 March, the police started a formal criminal investigation of AUF's Oslo chapter. The Treasurer Office of the Oslo administration concluded on 20 May that AUF Oslo had wrongfully received NOK 600,000 in government grants and NOK 48,000 in seminar subsidies. On 3 February 1996, Minister of Transport and Communications, Kjell Opseth of the Norwegian Labour Party, submitted a formal complaint to the police, in which he accused 24 other youth organisations of fraud. The accusations were divided into four different categories, which meant that there was a statute of limitations attached to some of the charges. This resulted in the acquittal of Thorbjørn Jagland (then leader of the Norwegian Labour Party) and Stoltenberg. This led to an angry outcry from the opposition parties. On 16 February, several lawyers, among them Juror Dr. Johs. Andenæs, stated that they had reacted strongly upon what they saw as the Labour Party's interference in an attempt to exempt AUF from the criminal investigation. On 1 April 1996, formal charges were made against former treasurer Røberg Larsen, former leader Elgsaas, former leader Anders Hornslien and former treasurer Anders Greif Mathisen by prosecutor Harald Strand. On 4 June, the Oslo Young Conservatives and the Oslo's Progress Party's Youth were forced to pay back NOK 70,000 to the city. On 29 October, the police dismissed the fraud cases against the other 22 youth organisations. Court case and charges Oslo District Court The scandal was processed by the Oslo District Court between January and March, 1998. The court was led by Judge Torjus Gard, while the head prosecutor was Atle Roaldsøy. Defendant for Bjørn Jarle Røberg-Larsen was Tor Erling Staff, while Anders Hornslien was defended by Sigurd Klomsæt, Mathisen's defender was Erik Nadheim, The treasurer and leader of AUF Oslo between 1992 and 1994 were charged with fraud. In 1992, AUF received NOK 283,000 too much in grants, the following year NOK 210,000 too much, and in 1994, NOK 120,000. Larsen and Elgsaas were both charged for all three incidents, while Hornslien was only charged for the first, while Mathisen was charged for the two last. Larsen was also charged with embezzlement of NOK 78,000. All four pleaded not guilty. =City's statement= Borghild Heddal, responsible for the municipal's grants to youth organisations, stated that there was no room for crime. Heddal, after the investigation, said: \\"The City of Oslo helped these organisations. But they decided to go behind our backs and continue with something that is unheard of.\\" She described the actions as a \\"betrayal of trust\\". The rules for the grants were sent out once per year; in addition, there was an annual seminar where these youth organisations were informed about the procedures, and she could confirm that AUF always participated on such events. Heddal pointed out that the rules were clear, and that there were no excuse to be found. She specifically mentioned that if a person chooses to not pay a membership for a given year, it would judicially be a statement that they no longer wanted to be considered members. She also commented that the rules stated that the membership had to be paid within the end of the year. After Newyears, it would not be possible to pay for membership the previous year. =Hornslien's statement= Anders Hornslien, leader of Oslo AUF from 1991 and 1993, claimed he had nothing to do with the accounts of the organisation. He stated: \\"I never approved such activities, and i've never supported the inflation of membership numbers.\\" He also denied that there were made lists of such people, which were used to apply for municipal grants. He admitted that he had paid a pile of 100 giros, he did not believe it to be suspicious however. \\"We only paid contingents for those who had expressed that they wanted to be members of AUF, or for those whom we had reason to believe wanted to be members\\". He expressed, when questioned, that there was not enough time to get the money back from the people who had confirmed by telephone, since the organisation was in the middle of organising its annual congress. Those who actually did pay, were signed up as paying members the following year. Hornslien stated in court that two former AUF leaders, Trond Giske and Turid Birkeland, pressured AUF Oslo to keep up the artificially high membership numbers. He also stated that it was pride, rather than money, that was the motivating factors for him. He continued, by telling the court that AUF Oslo was contacted on a yearly basis by the central leadership of the Labour Party, if the Labour Party leadership felt the membership was to low AUF was told to shape up. Hornslien was eventually charged and convicted of inflating membership numbers and the unlawful appropriation of NOK 200,000 in grants. He struggled to convince the court that the main reason for paying NOK 21,000 in membership fees was not to receive NOK 210.000 in grants. =Elgsaas' statement= Ragnar Bøe Elgsaas admitted having 'advanced' membership fees for people he had not asked if they wanted to be members. Each December, the board would phone people to ask them if they wanted to renew their membership. If they said yes, they would receive a giro in the mail. Elgsaas gave himself away, when stating \\"if this was not the case, we would 'advance' for the member\\". Elgsaas later denied stating this. Of the 700 people who had been incorrectly registered as members, Elgsaas estimated that they had phoned about half of them. They used several rules of thumb to consider who wanted to be members, without actually asking them, including those who applied for membership during the year, those who had formerly had positions, those who had been to information meetings, and those whom they knew personally. He also confirmed it was impossible to recollect the NOK 30 that was advanced, because the information of who had confirmed was automatically deleted from the computer system. The prosecution showed video evidence from a post office in the city center, where Elgaas was seen paying for the massive amount of giros. Included in this pile, was one for a woman who had reported AUF to the police in 1995, after she had attempted to leave the organisation nine times. Elgass had stated that he did not 'advance' for people who did not want to be members of the party. When questioned about the woman, he said that it could happen that they 'advanced' for the wrong person. The police had also found Elgsaas' mother's name on two of the giros. Elgsaas explained that he experienced pressure from the leader of AUF, Trond Giske, and the general secretary, Rita Ottervik, to continue with the 'advancements'. =Røberg-Larsen's statement= Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen, treasurer of Oslo AUF from 1992 to 1994, had at first denied to testify in the case, after advice from his defense attorney, but chose to change his mind. He told the court that the Oslo Labour Party pressured the Oslo AUF to maintain high membership numbers, in order to maintain their strong influence within AUF. He also told the court that the four accused members tried to keep the money advancements a secret, because they all knew that the practice was illegal. He also admitted that the leadership of AUF in the years between 1992 and 1994 conspired to inflate membership numbers in order to receive higher government subsidies. The leadership regularly paid membership fees for those members who did not pay their fees. In 1993, they also decided to pay membership fees for people who had never expressed any desire to be members of AUF. He also admitted that the four of them met at Hornslien's parliament office to discuss the situation after Verdens Gang broke the story. Unlike the other three indicted, Rødberg Larsen was also charged with embezzlement of money from several of the small, inactive chapters in Oslo. Elgsaas and Mathisen had stated that they had spent NOK 30,000 and NOK 11,000 each to 'advance' the membership fees, and had both stated that they had done this without believing they would be repaid the money. They also lent NOK 38,000 and NOK 18,000 to Rødberg Larsen to cover the deficit in the Oslo chapter. Rødberg Larsen claimed that it was Elgsaas and Mathisen that had emptied the inactive accounts, to cover their costs for the 'advancements'. He further claimed that he had only borrowed NOK 12–13,000 from Elgaas, and nothing from Mathisen. He claimed the deficit was something that Elgaas and Mathisen had imagined afterwards. When questioned about where the money from the inactive chapters had gone, Rødberg Larsen claimed that they had been used to start new chapters. When questioned about why there were no receipts for this, he stated the all the receipts had either not been kept, or been stolen in a framed theft. Rødberg Larsen made several statements which directly opposed those made by the other three indicted. He claimed the local chapters had been deliberately misled by the leadership in Oslo AUF. He also stated that the motivation to keep the membership numbers high, was to avoid that former leaders, who had become central in the Oslo Labour Party, would be discredited. He also felt that 120–130 people on \\"Bjørn Jarle's superlist\\" were people form whom 'advancements' were being made, but who they had no reason to believe actually wanted to be members of AUF. He also stated that the reason Mathisen was recruited from Akershus AUF, was that \\"he could be trusted regarding 'advancements'\\". = Stoltenberg's involvement = On 14 March 1995, twelve days after Verdens Gang published the story, Jens Stoltenberg and former leader of AUF, Turid Birkeland, admitted that 'advancing' money to pay for membership fees was a common and accepted practice at the time they were involved with the organisation. Jens Stoltenberg, since 2005 Prime Minister of Norway However, on 17 March 1998, Stoltenberg was called to give testimony in the case. He told the Oslo District Court, under oath, that he was unfamiliar with the artificial inflating of membership figures which took place in the AUF. He also told the court that he was unaware of any form of fraud taking place in the organisation under his leadership, and stated that he had never heard of 'advancing' money to pay for memberships until Verdens Gang broke the story on 2 March 1995. He also stated that in his opinion, it was not necessarily wrong to 'advance' money for members, provided that the members in question reimbursed this fee later on. Stoltenberg was also cross-examined by defence lawyer Tor Erling Staff, who pointed out that membership numbers for AUF during Stoltenbergs tenure, 11,000, were too high. According to Staff's calculations, such a huge membership numbers would mean that AUF had to recruit several thousand members each year. The following day, Jens Stoltenberg told the court that the government had accepted non-paying members in youth organisations as normal members for many years, provided that the membership was confirmed by word of mouth by the member in question. = Jagland's involvement = Thorbjørn Jagland, former Prime Minister of Norway (1996–97) When Thorbjørn Jagland gave evidence in the case, he agreed with Stoltenberg that it was not necessarily wrong to 'advance' money for memberships, provided that the members in question reimbursed this fee later on. He did, however, tell the court that it was unacceptable to transfer money from AUF's main bank account to pay for membership fees. He also agreed, when pressed by the prosecutor, that membership numbers were too high when he was the leader. In his defense he stated that if AUF were to follow the law too rigidly, they would only have ended up with a quarter of the membership numbers that the Young Conservatives operated with. He said that it would have been absurd to follow the law to the letter. He also told the court that AUF should have received even more subsidie, referring to some of the other political youth parties that used similar methods for calculating membership numbers. = Other involved former members = Turid Birkeland and Øystein Mæland, both AUF board members during Jens Stoltenberg's time as AUF leader, admitted that there had been a culture of inflating membership numbers in the organisation at the time. Stoltenberg denied any knowledge of this. Erik Solheim, former leader of Socialist Youth, admitted that also other youth parties had inflated membership numbers. Former AUF leader, Anniken Huitfeldt, also admitted that membership numbers were too high. She told the court that the reason why AUF decided to keep up the practice of during her leadership, was to protect former members of the organisation who had contributed to this inflation. She also admitted that she was taught how to 'advance' money for membership fees when she first joined the organisation. Øystein Mæland eventually cancelled his membership with the Labour Party because he felt that the four members sentenced for their involvement in the fraud were used as scapegoats.  Verdict  All four charged were convicted of fraud on 21 March 1998. In all major matters, the prosecutors submission of evidence was supported by the judge. The court felt that the fraud was the result of a planned work, and had been ongoing for several years. The court did not believe that the organisation did not have financial motives for the fraud. The court also stated that an organisation culture was not mitigating circumstances. It also stated that the leaders and treasurers had a personal responsibility. The court also felt that not following a requirement from the city issued in 1992, requiring AUF to clean up its membership register system, was in the disfavour of the indicted. All four indicted were found guilty and had to serve prison sentences: *Bjørn Jarle Røberg-Larsen was sentenced to six months in jail. *Ragnar Bøe Elgsaas was sentenced to seven months in jail. *Anders Greif Mathisen received a suspended sentence of 90 days in jail. *Anders Hornslien was sentenced to five months in jail. Both Mathisen and Hornslien chose to appeal to case to Borgarting Court of Appeal, but this was dismissed by the appellate court, ruling that the appeal did not have a chance to be met.

It is a brick pagoda tower built on the location of a previous wooden one that had been burnt down by lightning fire in 1044. Along with the Liuhe, Lingxiao, Liaodi, Pizhi, and Beisi pagodas, it is seen as a masterpiece of Song dynasty architecture.

The architectural style features densely positioned, articulated dougong in the eaves (miyan) and multiple stories (louge). The exterior features more than fifty different varieties of glazed brick and 1,600 intricate and richly detailed carvings, including those of standing and sitting Buddha, standing monks, singers and flying dancers, flowers, lions, dragons and other legendary beasts as well as many fine engravings. Under the eaves are 104 bells that ring in the wind. The foundation rests in the silt of the Yellow River. Inside the Iron Pagoda are frescos of the classical Chinese tales, such as The Journey to the West. History In the Northern Song (960–1127) dynasty's capital city of Kaifeng, the famous architect Yu Hao built a magnificent wooden pagoda as part of Youguo Temple (between 965–995 CE.) that was considered by many of his contemporaries to be a marvel of art. Unfortunately, the widely admired structure burned down in 1044 after a lightning strike. Under the order of Emperor Renzong (1022–1063), a new pagoda was built in its place by 1049. The new tower was built of nonflammable brick and stone and was dubbed the 'Iron Pagoda' due its iron-grey color when viewed from afar (its bricks are in fact glazed red, brown, blue, and green). In 1847 the Yellow River overflowed its banks and the Youguo Temple collapsed, but the Iron Pagoda survived. Historically, the pagoda has experienced 38 earthquakes, six floods and many other disasters, but it remains intact after almost 1,000 years. In 1994, the Iron Pagoda was featured on a two-yuan Chinese postage stamp.

He was brother-in-law to P. G. T. Beauregard, whose first wife, Marie Antoinette Laure, was Villeré's sister. Villeré was born in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, to one of the most prominent French Creole families in southern Louisiana. His father, Jules Villeré, was a sugar cane planter in Plaquemines Parish, while his grandfather, Jacques Villeré, had served as the second governor of Louisiana. He was educated at St. Mary's College in Baltimore, graduating with high honors. He returned to New Orleans to study law and was admitted to the bar in 1849. However, he preferred planting to the legal profession, and so focused on managing his plantation in Plaquemines Parish. In 1852, Villeré was both elected to the state constitutional convention, and appointed district attorney of Plaquemines Parish. He served two terms in the state legislature beginning in 1854, and was an elector for James Buchanan in 1856. After Louisiana announced its secession on January 26, 1861, Villeré raised a cavalry company in support of the nascent Confederacy. He was, however, elected to the First Confederate Congress as the representative for Louisiana's 1st district before he could serve in the field. There he served on the committees of claims, commerce, and military affairs. In 1863, Villeré received a symbolic commission as a colonel in the Confederate States Army from Louisiana Governor Henry W. Allen, and was reelected to the Second Confederate Congress. As with his initial election, Villeré received only a slim majority of the votes cast. During his time in the Confederate Congress, Villeré was an ardent nationalist and supported efforts to strengthen the central government in Richmond. However, the removal of P. G. T. Beauregard from command of the Army of Mississippi in 1862 led to a falling out with Jefferson Davis, and Villeré published a pamphlet castigating the Confederate President's decision and defending his brother-in- law's controversial actions at Shiloh. Villeré would go on to vote no confidence in General Braxton Bragg, Secretary of the Treasury Christopher G. Memminger, and Secretary of the Navy Stephen R. Mallory, all of whom were Davis's trusted advisors. After the war, Colonel Villeré—as he now styled himself—largely retired from public life, emerging only to succeed his brother-in-law as supervisor of the Louisiana Lottery after Beauregard's death in February 1893. He died at his home in Jefferson Parish on January 7, 1899, and was interred in the Army of Tennessee Tumulus in Metairie Cemetery.

Premiership season In 1930, the VFL competition consisted of twelve teams of 18 on-the-field players each, plus one substitute player, known as the 19th man. A player could be substituted for any reason, Once he had been substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances. Teams played each other in a home-and- away season of 18 rounds; matches 12 to 18 were the \\"home-and-way reverse\\" of matches 5 to 11 (i.e., the last seven matches of the round). Once the 18 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1930 VFL Premiers were determined by the specific format and conventions of the amended \\"Argus system\\". =Round 1= - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Home team  Home team score  Away team  Away team score  Venue  Crowd  Date -

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1930 VFL Premiership team was Collingwood. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Gordon Coventry of Collingwood with 118 goals. * The winner of the 1930 Brownlow Medal was Stan Judkins of Richmond with 4 votes.  At 5 ft 5 in (166 cm) and , Stan Judkins is the shortest and lightest player ever to win the Brownlow Medal. * North Melbourne took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1930. * The seconds premiership was won by , which finished the season undefeated. Geelong 14.12 (96) defeated 11.8 (74) in the Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the firsts Preliminary Final on 4 October. Brownlow Medal When the VFL's Umpires Panel counted the Brownlow Medal votes that had been awarded during the 1930 season, it found that three players had been considered best on the ground on four occasions: Harry Collier of Collingwood, Allan Hopkins of Footscray, and Stan Judkins of Richmond. The Panel advised the VFL of the tied result and, because there was no provision for a tied result, the Panel recommended that no Brownlow Medal be awarded for 1930. The league instead decided to break the tie by awarding the medal to the player who had achieved his votes in the fewest games. Collier had played 18 games, Hopkins had played 15 games, and Judkins only 12 games; consequently the award went to Judkins. In 1981, the league changed Brownlow Medal rules to allow more than one player to receive the medal if tied on votes; and, in 1989, it retrospectively awarded medals to Harry Collier and Allan Hopkins for 1930. Notable events * Harrison House at 31 Spring Street, Melbourne (at the corner of Spring Street and Flinders Lane), was officially opened as VFL headquarters. * The Australian National Football Council introduced a substitute player, known as the 19th man. This meant that teams now had 18 \\"run on\\" players, and one \\"reserve\\" player. The 19th man could be substituted for an injured player, or for any other player for tactical reasons.

The VFL also institutes a series of penalties for breaches (fines, suspension of players and deduction of premiership points) of what rapidly became known as the \\"Coulter Law\\" (after Gordon Coulter, the Player Payment Committee's chairman). * In round 12, Gordon Coventry kicked a record 17 goals.

Career Townsend was born in Long Eaton, Derbyshire. He played his debut game for Derbyshire against Leicestershire in August 1934, which was his only game in the 1934 season when he scored 7 and 0. He played six games in the 1935 season without distinction, often being denied the chance to play a second innings and during Derbyshire's Championship-winning 1936 season he played only twice. He appeared in three games in the 1937 season but in the 1938 season came to the fore playing more matches and hitting two half-centuries. In the 1939 season he played a fuller season and made his top score of 142 not out against Somerset. Townsend went to South Africa during the war and played one first- class match against a team of South Africans, playing for an Air Force XI. He played for a Derbyshire team in 1945 and when the championship restarted in the 1946 season he became a first-choice batsman. Against Warwickshire, he scored 105 against the economical, penetrating bowling of Test player Eric Hollies. During the 1947 season, Townsend scored 137 against Yorkshire and 102 against Surrey and managed eight half-centuries, and was the most successful Derbyshire batsman during the season. In the 1948 season, he scored 102 not out against Lancashire. In the 1949 season he sustained an eye injury when fielding at short leg and this seriously affected his ability to focus. As a result, he played fewer games in 1949 and in 1950 played only twice before ending his first-class career.Wisden Obituaries in 1994 In his last three years he was also playing for Derbyshire second XI in the minor counties competition. Townsend was a right-handed batsman and played 200 innings in 117 first-class matches with an average of 23.13 and a top score of 142 not out. He bowled 11 overs without taking a wicket.Arnold Townsend at Cricket Archive Wisden described him as \\"the epitome of [Derbyshire's] patient watchful batting\\". Townsend died in Derby at the age of 81.

The upper hindwing having a thin submarginal line. There are no eyespots on the upperside of the wings. Below, the butterfly has a white discal band which runs across both wings. It has five eyespots on the underside of the wings. In the forewing, it has two eyespots, with the anterior eyespot slightly smaller. In the hindwing, it has two eyespots on the apical region and a separate ocellus in the tornal (hindmost) region. The uppermost of the eyespots in the hindwing are greatly smaller, while the remaining two are more or less of equal sizes. The eggs are spherical and yellowish. They are laid on the leaf blades and stems of grasses. The larvae are spindle shaped, transversely wrinkled, and covered in small tubercles, giving it a rough appearance. Two long brown spines on the head point forward, while a pair of pinkish prongs project from the anal segment. The colour above is rosy red with a blue dorsal and a white lateral line, below which, the underparts are green. The pupae are perpendicularly suspended, slender and regular, except that the head-case is produced into a long beak formed of two thin processes like split straws. The colour is whitish brown to yellow, with faint bands of a darker shades. It resembles a large grain of barley or a tiny banana. Orsotriaena medus superficially resembles members of the genus Mycalesis (bushbrowns), but can readily be identified by the number of spots.

Dating from 1636, it is the playwright's last known extant work; it appeared four years before his death in 1640.Contemporary records refer to other, later plays, reputedly by Massinger, that have not survived: The King and the Subject (1638), Alexius, or The Chaste Lover (1639), and The Prisoner, or The Fair Anchoress of Pausilippo (1640). The play was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 9 May 1636; it was acted by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre. It was first published in 1655, in the octavo volume titled Three New Plays issued by Humphrey Moseley, a volume that also contained Massinger's The Guardian and the Massinger/Fletcher play A Very Woman. When Moseley entered the play into the Stationers' Register on 9 September 1653, he listed it as Alexius, the Chaste Gallant or The Bashful Lover. There is no character named \\"Alexius\\" is Massinger's play — but a play titled Alexius, the Chaste Gallant had been acted in 1639. This appears to have been an instance of Moseley's habit of taking advantage of the inherent confusion of titles and subtitles to register two plays for the price of one. (For similar examples, see The Guardian, The Lovers' Progress, and A Very Woman.) Comic material from The Bashful Lover (and also from A Very Woman and The Guardian) was adapted into a droll titled Love Lost in the Dark in 1680.Garrett, p. 13. The Bashful Lover was successfully revived at Covent Garden in 1798.Phelan, p. 62. No specific source for the play has been identified; but like many of Massinger's plays, The Bashful Lover shares linkages with the prose romances of contemporary Spanish writers like Miguel de Cervantes. Massinger's protagonist, Hortensio, has been characterized as \\"a sort of pale Quixote; a knight-errant a little cracked or crazed; very sincere, and a trifle given to uttering vague and useless professions of hyperbolic humility and devotion.\\" Symons, pp. 183–4. Synopsis The play is set in an ahistorical version of northern Italy during the High Renaissance. The Duke of Mantua, ruled by a Gonzaga, is threatened militarily by the ruler of Florence, Duke Lorenzo (suggesting one of the Medicis). The opening scene, however, deals with love rather than war: a love-sick gentleman who calls himself Hortensio is hanging around the Mantuan court, wherever he can catch sight of the princess Matilda. He is the \\"bashful lover\\" of the title. Hortensio has bribed Ascanio, the princess's page, to inform him of her movements — and Ascanio is open about this to his mistress, recognizing that Hortensio's infatuation is harmless. Matilda courteously meets with Hortensio, and allows his distant attentions. But the Mantuan court is preoccupied with the military situation. The Duke receives the Florentine ambassador, Alonzo, but rejects Lorenzo's demands for the city's surrender and Matilda's hand in marriage. (When Ascanio sees Alonzo at court, he faints and is carried out.) The play's action swiftly moves to the Mantuan countryside; Hortensio has joined the Mantuan forces to prove his worth to Matilda, and Ascanio has accompanied him. When the two armies engage in combat, the Florentine forces are victorious. In the process, the Florentine officer Alonzo is seriously wounded, and falls into the care of Octavio, a former Mantuan general and courtier who lives retired in the country after losing the Duke's favor. It turns out that the page Ascanio is Octavio's daughter Maria in disguise; she was previously seduced and abandoned by Alonzo. Octavio nurses Alonzo back to health; after his near death, Alonzo is reflective, and repentant over his treatment of Maria. (Octavio at one point masquerades as a monk to help Alonzo \\"cure the ulcers of his mind,\\" to overcome his depression and mental distress — a feature typical of Massinger's dramaturgy.)For masquerading as a clergyman, see The Emperor of the East; for recovery from depression, see A Very Woman. Hortensio, after fighting bravely and rescuing Gonzaga from capture, is himself captured by Lorenzo's forces — as is Matilda; the two are re-united in captivity. Duke Lorenzo, talking among his officers, admits that his prior demand for Matilda's hand was a feint of ambition, and that he has no real interest in her, or in a marriage of state. He changes his mind, however, when he actually meets her. The princess's beauty and her noble character work a change of heart upon Lorenzo: he renounces his military conquest and returns Mantua to Gonzaga's control. In his new magnanimity, Lorenzo allows Matilda a free choice among her three suitors — himself, Hortensio, and a prince of Parma named Uberti; but in eavesdropping on a conversation between Hortensio and Matilda, Lorenzo and Gonzaga come to recognize Hortensio as her worthiest choice. Uberti is less willing to concede—until it is revealed that Hortensio is actually Galeazzo, a prince of Milan and the new ruler of that city. Alonzo, recovered from his wounds, marries Maria, and Octavio is restored to favor. Notes Sources * Garrett, Martin. Massinger: The Critical Heritage. London, Routledge, 1991. * Maxwell, Baldwin.

From frontier to the 20th century Daniel S. Tuttle, third Bishop of Missouri The Episcopal Dioceses of Missouri was founded in 1841 by the Episcopal congregations that already existed in the state. In 1844, the diocese elected its first bishop, Cicero Hawks, who presided over five priests and nine congregations. He held the diocese together during the Civil War, increasing the reputation of the Episcopal Church in Missouri. After Hawks' death in 1868, the diocese elected Charles F. Robertson as the second bishop of the diocese. By the time of his death in 1886, the diocese had grown to 51 congregations and 40 missions throughout the state. After the election of the third bishop, Daniel S. Tuttle, the Diocesan Convention approved a plan to split the diocese in half. Tuttle supported the newly created Episcopal Diocese of West Missouri by providing funds to sustain it through its first years. The church's mission expands As Tuttle aged, the Diocesan Convention appointed Frederick Foote Johnson as bishop coadjutor in 1911. He took over as diocesan bishop upon Tuttle's death in 1923. During Johnson's tenure, the diocese expanded its youth and campus ministries. As Johnson's health failed, the dean of Christ Church Cathedral, William Scarlett, was appointed as bishop coadjutor. He succeeded Johnson in 1930. Scarlett worked tirelessly for social reform, championing the cause of those left jobless and homeless during the Great Depression. In 1935, the Episcopal City Mission was formed to minister to those in jail. He also revitalized the Christian Education system at this time. The civil rights movement Scarlett was succeeded by Arthur C. Lichtenberger in 1950. As Bishop, he held a prominent role in the St. Louis civil rights movement. He was elected as the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in 1958. He was succeeded as diocesan bishop by George L. Cadigan. who continued Lichtenberger's civil rights mission, Cadigan worked with lay leaders and community members to fight for the rights of African-Americans in Missouri. He also gave more control of the church to laity. Cadigan retired in April 1975 and died December 14, 2005.  Recent developments in the diocese  William Jones succeeded Cadigan, and he immediately attempted to deal with the discord in the diocese. While great strides had been made on the social front for which the Church could be proud, the number of Episcopalians was declining as the Church failed to attract new members to replace those who left over disagreement with the direction the Church was taking, exemplified by a new Book of Common Prayer and the ordination of women. Jones retired in 1992. He was replaced by Hays Rockwell, who had been elected bishop coadjutor in 1990. Rockwell's episcopacy has been characterized as a time of renewal with an influx of new rectors for many of the congregations, a restructuring of the diocesan staff, an emphasis on congregational development, and maintenance of an Episcopal presence in the city of St. Louis and rural areas of the diocese. Rockwell retired in June 2002 and was replaced by George Wayne Smith on June 6, 2002.Diocese of Missouri website Bishop's Office website . Retrieved June 11, 2009.

Career William Waud, trained as an architect in England, was an assistant to Sir Joseph Paxton and worked on the design of the Crystal Palace for the Great Exhibition in 1851. Soon afterward he joined his brother, Alfred Waud in America. William was first employed with Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper. While working as a \\"Special Artist\\" for Leslie's, William covered art correspondent assignments in the South, including the inauguration of Jefferson Davis as President of the Confederacy and the bombardment of Fort Sumter. In 1864 Waud joined the staff of Harper's Weekly and worked along with his brother Alfred (also with Harper's) during the Petersburg Campaign.

It was the first Latter Day Saint periodical that was published in a language other than English. History The first edition of Prophwyd y Jubili was printed in Rhydybont, Wales, in July 1846. One edition was published every month until the final issue was published in December 1848. The editor of Prophwyd y Jubili was Dan Jones, who was presiding over the Mormon missionaries in Wales at the time. All but the final two editions of the periodical were printed on the press owned by Jones's non-Mormon older brother, the Reverend John Jones. The final two editions were published at Carmarthen on the press owned by John Davis, a young Latter Day Saint bachelor. Prophwyd y Jubili was similar in content to the Millennial Star, the church periodical targeted towards English speaking Latter Day Saints in the British Isles. A substantial amount of material was borrowed from the Millennial Star and translated into Welsh for publication in Prophwyd y Jubili, especially doctrinal writings and letters from church leaders. Other contents were conference reports, progress in baptisms, poetry, accounts of miraculous healings, accounts of persecution and conversion, and an occasional \\"thumbing of the nose\\" at the enemy's lack of success in forestalling the spread of Mormonism in Wales. In almost every issue, there is a defense against an attack on Mormonism that had been printed in one of the other Christian periodicals in Wales. The only fact known about the circulation of Prophwyd y Jubili is a comment made by Dan Jones at a December 1847 church meeting where he comments that he had increased the circulation to 1200.Millennial Star, 15 April 1848, 122. The cover price of Prophwyd y Jubili was originally three pence, which was cut to two pence with the January 1847 edition. Prophwyd y Jubili ceased publication when Dan Jones ended his first Welsh mission and returned to the United States. In 1849, Udgorn Seion succeeded Prophwyd y Jubili as the official Welsh language periodical of the church; the new periodical was edited by John Davis. Full name The complete name of the periodical was Prophwyd y Jubili, neu, Seren y Saint; yn cynnwys hanes sefydliad \\"Goruchwyliaeth cyflawnder yr amseroedd,\\" ynghyd ag erlidigaethau, merthyrdod, ac alltudiaeth ei hufyddion, a'u llwyddiant (in English Prophet of the Jubilee, or, Star of the Saints; containing an account of the establishment of the \\"Dispensation of the fulness of times,\\" together with the persecutions, martyrdom, and exile of its adepts, and their success).

On 6 November 1997, she was confronted in the driveway of her suburban Melbourne home and shot repeatedly as her three young children, aged 3, 5 and 10, cowered inside her car. The murder shocked the public. Despite the Victorian government posting a $1 million reward for information leading to a conviction,Herald Sun, '$100,000 reward to killer's accomplices, Phillip Cullen, p.1, 17 September 2001 no one has been charged in relation to this murder. Murder Jane Thurgood-Dove arrived at her Muriel Street, Niddrie, home in the afternoon of 6 November after collecting her children from school. As she climbed from her 4WD, she was approached by a \\"short, pot- bellied man\\" who proceeded to chase her around the vehicle. When she tripped and fell, the man then pulled out a large calibre pistol and, in full view of her terrified children, shot her repeatedly in her head and torso, killing her instantly. The man ran to a waiting getaway car - a stolen metallic blue Holden Commodore - driven by a younger, slimmer man. The assailants sped off. The car was later found torched in nearby Farrell Street. Investigations revealed that the Holden Commodore was stolen the previous day from Princes Park, Carlton. Suspects Following the murder, police initially followed two distinct lines of investigation, but more recently a third possibility also presented itself. =1. The husband= Most victims are murdered by people they know. Therefore, it was not unreasonable that police first consider if Mark Thurgood-Dove, her husband, was involved. However, police investigations tended to support his assertions that his marriage was happy and healthy. Further, he was a hardworking man with no previous criminal record. In April 2000, he passed a polygraph test and has since been eliminated as a suspect. =2. The secret lover= Thurgood-Dove had revealed to at least two friends that a well-respected, serving policeman was obsessed with her and, indeed, had been diagnosed with depression since her murder. It is not known whether any intimate relationship ever developed between her and the policeman. In 1998, Melbourne's Herald Sun carried the front-page headline that the policeman was the prime suspect in Thurgood-Dove's murder. He is believed to have admitted loving her and asking her to leave her husband, but denied killing her. It was speculated that the policeman hired two hitmen to kill Thurgood-Dove when she refused to leave her husband. The policeman was interviewed by the Homicide squad on three occasions. The policeman had no alibi for the time of Thurgood-Dove's killing and, indeed, failed a polygraph test on 29 April 2000. However, police could not uncover sufficient evidence to charge the man. Some police were concerned that the suspect in the case was still an operational policeman and armed. The policeman, who worked in the city, was believed to have daily dealings with the public and routinely carried a revolver in the course of his duty. Some police had sought his removal from operational duties. But police command was believed to have refused to suspend or transfer the man after he produced medical and psychiatric evidence that he was fit to continue active duty. On 7 October 2003, the Herald Sun quoted a senior homicide detective eliminating the policeman, who was the prime suspect in the Thurgood-Dove murder, from further inquiries.Herald Sun, 'Policeman cleared of murder', Cameron Smith, 7 October 2003 =3. Mistaken identity= Following the announcement of a $1 million reward, police received information that a group of Geelong bikers had been implicated in the murder. It was said that Thurgood-Dove was mistakenly murdered, with the real target being a woman of similar appearance with a 4WD who lived like her, on a corner property in the same street. Police offered a potential indemnity deal to a former biker suspected of being the getaway driver in return for identifying the person who organised the hit. Two other men believed to have stolen the vehicle and committing the murder have since died.

Survey of Wildland Firefighters  On July 10, 2001, The Thirtymile fire, started by an escaped campfire near Winthrop, Washington, claimed the lives of four U.S. Forest Service firefighters. On January 30, 2007 the U.S. Attorney in Spokane, Washington, charged the Incident Commander of the fire, Ellreese Daniels, with four counts of involuntary manslaughter and seven counts of making false statements. On February 20, 2007, the IAWF released a survey of 3,362 firefighters which showed that 36% of the full-time wildland firefighters surveyed will make themselves less available to be assigned to wildland fires as a direct result of manslaughter charges filed against a firefighter in Washington state.  IAWF Awards  The IAWF WILDLAND FIRE SAFETY AWARD is given to someone in the wildland firefighting community who has made a significant contribution to wildland firefighter safety, either directly on the fireline, or indirectly through management or cultural changes. The purpose of the IAWF EMBER AWARD is to acknowledge sustained achievement in wildland fire science. The name 'Ember' was chosen to reflect the fact that research and science often move slowly, and their benefits or impacts may not be apparent for years or more.  Infamous World Fires  The International Association of Wildland Fire created a partial list, by date of the year, of some of the more famous, or infamous, multiple fatality wildland fires around the world over the last 150 years. It is not intended to be a complete list of every fatality fire. By having these wildland fires on a calendar, the lessons learned from even a 130-year-old fire will be less likely to be forgotten.

It is used to describe the potential behavior of discrete systems. It consists of states and transitions between states, which may be labeled with labels chosen from a set; the same label may appear on more than one transition. If the label set is a singleton, the system is essentially unlabeled, and a simpler definition that omits the labels is possible. Transition systems coincide mathematically with abstract rewriting systems (as explained further in this article) and directed graphs. They differ from finite state automata in several ways: * The set of states is not necessarily finite, or even countable. * The set of transitions is not necessarily finite, or even countable. * No \\"start\\" state or \\"final\\" states are given. Transition systems can be represented as directed graphs.  Formal definition  Formally, a transition system is a pair (S, ->) where S is a set of states and -> is a relation of state transitions (i.e., a subset of S × S). A transition from state p to state q, i.e. (p, q) ∈ ->, is written as p -> q. A labelled transition system is a tuple (S, Λ, ->) where S is a set of states, Λ is a set of labels and -> is a relation of labelled transitions (i.e., a subset of S × Λ × S). (p,α,q) ∈ -> is written as : p \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} q \\\\, and represents a transition from state p to state q with label α. Labels can represent different things depending on the language of interest. Typical uses of labels include representing input expected, conditions that must be true to trigger the transition, or actions performed during the transition. Labelled transitions systems were originally introduced as named transition systems.Robert M. Keller (July 1976) \\"Formal Verification of Parallel Programs\\", Communications of the ACM, vol 19, nr 7, p. 371-384. If, for any given p and α, there exists only a single tuple (p,α,q) in ->, then one says that α is deterministic (for p). If, for any given p and α, there exists at least one tuple (p,α,q) in ->, then one says that α is executable (for p). This can be rephrased in terms of category theory. Every labelled state transition system (S, \\\\Lambda, \\\\rightarrow) is bijectively a function \\\\xi_{\\\\rightarrow} from S to the powerset of S indexed by \\\\Lambda written as \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\Lambda \\\\times S), defined by :: p \\\\mapsto \\\\\\\\{ (\\\\alpha, q) \\\\in \\\\Lambda \\\\times S : p \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} q \\\\\\\\}.. Therefore a labelled state transition system is a F-coalgebra for the functor P(\\\\Lambda \\\\times -).  Relation between labelled and unlabelled transition system  There are many relations between these concepts. Some are simple, such as observing that a labelled transition system where the set of labels consists of only one element is equivalent to an unlabelled transition system. However, not all these relations are equally trivial.  Comparison with abstract rewriting systems  As a mathematical object, an unlabeled transition system is identical with an (unindexed) abstract rewriting system. If we consider the rewriting relation as an indexed set of relations, as some authors do, then a labeled transition system is equivalent to an abstract rewriting system with the indices being the labels. The focus of the study and the terminology are different however. In a transition system one is interested in interpreting the labels as actions, whereas in an abstract rewriting system the focus is on how objects may be transformed (rewritten) into others.Marc Bezem, J. W. Klop, Roel de Vrijer (\\"Terese\\"), Term rewriting systems, Cambridge University Press, 2003, . p. 7-8  Extensions  In model checking, a transition system is sometimes defined to include an additional labeling function for the states as well, resulting in a notion that encompasses that of Kripke structure. Action languages are extensions of transition systems, adding a set of fluents F, a set of values V, and a function that maps F × S to V.Micheal Gelfond, Vladimir Lifschitz (1998) \\"Action Languages\\", Linköping Electronic Articles in Computer and Information Science, vol 3, nr 16.

He was also known as Akemitsu or his birth name, Nichiro Ishimura (石村 日郎). He is usually identified as a Surrealist although he also painted works that can be classified in other styles and genres. He was born into a small landowning family in 1907 in Hiroshima, and given the name Nichiro Ishimura, which he later changed to Ai-Mitsu when he moved to Tokyo to pursue his career as an artist. In 1934 he married Kie, a teacher of the deaf who helped support him through his struggles as an artist. His most famous work is \\"Landscape with an Eye\\" (1938), currently held in the collection of the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo. It consists of shapeless forms with a large eye in a landscape setting. In 1944 he was conscripted and sent to China in the months after the war, where he died of a fever, possibly due to malaria and dysentery, on the outskirts of Shanghai. In March - May 2007, a retrospective exhibition commemorating the 100th anniversary of Aimitsu's birthday was held at the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo.

Born in County Kerry, Ireland, Chute joined the British Army in 1832. Posted to British India with the 70th Regiment, he helped deal with the Indian Mutiny of 1854. Sent to the Antipodes, he served in the New Zealand Wars and later in Australia. He returned to New Zealand in 1865 as a major general and commander of all British forces in the country. He led a four-week campaign during the Second Taranaki War to destroy Maori resistance in the Taranaki. The campaign was the last to be carried out in New Zealand by imperial troops. At the end of his service in New Zealand, he went back to Australia. Knighted in 1867, he returned to England in 1870 with the last of the Imperial forces garrisoning Australia. Promoted to General in 1877, he retired from the British Army four years later. He died in 1886 at Berkshire in England. Early life Trevor Chute, born at Tralee in County Kerry, Ireland, on 31 July 1816, was the third son of Francis Chute and Mary Ann Chute (née Bomford). He entered the British Army in 1832 and was posted to the Ceylon Rifles. His overall robust appearance and powerful voice earned him the nickname \\"The Kerry Bull\\" among his soldiers. He later transferred to the 70th Regiment. By 1847 he had attained the rank of major, performing duties in Ireland in 1848 before being transferred with the regiment to India in 1849. India In India, the regiment was based at Peshawar with Chute, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel, as its commander. He received a further promotion to colonel in 1854. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857, he led the rescue of trapped officers in Peshawar and dispersed the mutineers there. Moving to Lucknow, he organized the formation of flying columns to suppress the mutiny elsewhere in the country. New Zealand & Australia In 1861, the 70th Regiment was posted to New Zealand. Arriving in the country in May 1861, Chute and his regiment was involved in the construction of the Great South Road, which extended from Drury to the Waikato River. During his service at this time, he was the president of the court of inquiry established to review the conduct of the 'battle' of Waireka. In March 1863 Chute was promoted to brigadier-general and posted to Australia where he had been appointed commander of British troops stationed there. Chute returned to New Zealand as a major-general in September 1865, replacing General Duncan Cameron as commander of the British forces in the country. Chute also continued his role as commander of British forces in Australia. His arrival in New Zealand coincided with the Second Taranaki War. There were high tensions between colonists and Māori of Taranaki due to Governor George Grey's confiscation of land in the area despite a proclamation of peace. A series of ambushes and murders mounted by Māori against British troops and colonists from mid-1865 prompted Grey to task Chute with carrying out offensive operations against the Taranaki tribes. His task was made more difficult though the gradual withdrawal of British forces as the New Zealand Government took greater responsibility for its own defence. The 70th Regiment, Chute's former command, was one of the first units to leave New Zealand. Gustavus von Tempsky's depiction of the January 1866 \\"forest march\\" After developing a strategy for offensive operations with his primary subordinate in Taranaki, Colonel Henry Warre, Chute began his march from Wanganui on 3 January 1866 with a force of 620 men. Sweeping across the south and centre of Taranaki, his expedition, a mixture of British soldiers, local militia and kūpapa (pro-Government Māori), destroyed several, mostly undefended, villages between the Waitotara River and Mount Egmont. His tactics were direct; little reconnaissance was carried out when preparing for attacks on villages and instead his force simply mounted a frontal assault, taking few prisoners. After destroying a traditional pā on 14 January, he then commenced a 9-day \\"forest march\\", a journey across the eastern base of Mount Egmont to New Plymouth. This march, which would have typically taken two or three days, almost resulted in disaster. He and his men became lost and exhausted their supplies. Reduced to eating their pack horses, a supply column brought relief and Chute and his men arrived in New Plymouth on 3 February 1866. Following Chute's expedition, further campaigning was carried out in Taranaki but without British troops, which continued to be withdrawn from New Zealand. By 1867 Chute had moved with his headquarters to Melbourne in Australia. That same year he was created Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and on 9 July 1868, he married Ellen Browning, of Auckland. While in Australia he helped develop the local militia and oversaw the reduction of the British garrisons there. From late 1869 to early 1870, he was the administrator of New South Wales following the departure of Governor Sir John Young to Canada to become governor general there. Later life In October 1870 Chute followed the last imperial troops stationed in Victoria back to England. Nearly three years later, following the death of Lieutenant General George Napier, he was appointed colonel of the 22nd Regiment. He was made a full general in 1877 and four years later was placed on the retired list. He died at Binfield, near Reading in Berkshire, on 12 March 1886, aged 69.

He received seventeen decorations for his war service. From the 1970s he was active in the Progress Party, where he was a city council member in Oslo and deputy MP. He was an honorary party member. Military career =Early life and World War II= Munthe-Kaas was the son of Otto H. Munthe-Kaas and younger brother of Otto Ulrik Munthe-Kaas, both military officers. His father was, before World War II, head of the military camp at Setermoen, and was head of the II Field Battalion in the 16th Infantry Regiment during the German invasion of Norway.Dag Christensen: Hemmelig agent i Norge, Oslo: Hjemmets bokforlag, 1987, p. 12–13. Hugo Munthe-Kaas had before the outbreak of the war, volunteered for the guard company in Tromsø, where he served during the German attack.Christensen, p. 15-18. He then joined the war commissary in Tromsø and was accepted for service in the 16th Infantry Regiment, despite being two years too young for conscription.Christensen, p. 20. Munthe-Kaas served during the campaign in Northern Norway as an orderly in the courier service and as a sniper in the Battles of Narvik. His service lasted until the Norwegian mainland capitulation on 10 June 1940.Christensen, p. 21. After the surrender of mainland Norway, Munthe-Kaas was demobilized and he continued secondary school in Tromsø in early 1941. In April that year he was recruited into the Norwegian resistance movement owing to the efforts of the journalist Sverre Larsen from the Tromsø newspaper.Christensen, p. 39. In mid 1941 he went on to Trondheim to study at Trondheim Commerce School.Christensen, p. 41. In Trondheim he was again involved with the resistance and, among other things, he did intelligence work covering the German U-boat base in the city, which allowed British planes to bomb the major transformer station at the port in early 1942.Christensen, p. 41–45. In April of the same year he came over to Britain with the fishing boat Siglaos, skippered by Leif Andreas Larsen.Christensen, p. 52–53.Bjørn Rørholt and Bjarne Thorsen: Usynlige soldater. Nordmenn i Secret Service forteller, Oslo: Aschehoug, 1990, p. 118–119. =In the United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, Munthe-Kaas joined the exiled Norwegian forces. He was soon recruited by the British Secret Intelligence Service for special assignments in Norway. He underwent training as a radio operator and a commando soldier.Christensen, p. 56–70. Based in the United Kingdom, through the war years he carried out several operations in occupied Norway, arriving both by air and submarine. For the British the need for intelligence information from Norway increased after the larger German ships was transferred to Norwegian waters. They realized that the threat to the convoy route to and from the Soviet Union was growing, and were particularly concerned with the threat that the German battleship Tirpitz posed after the ship moved north. It became important for the British to establish a network of stations from northern Nordland to Troms, so that intelligence information about German ship movements could be sent to the UK. Munthe-Kaas was assigned such a mission, contributing to the creation of a network of agents with radios in July 1942. During the night of 15 July 1942 he was delivered to Langøya in Vesterålen by a Norwegian PBY Catalina.Christensen, p. 73–75 and 80–85. He established the radio station LIBRARørholt and Thorsen, p. 444. and in the summer of 1942 worked to organize the intelligence network that monitored the movements of the Tirpitz in northern Norwegian waters. After the first successful operation in Norway, Munthe-Kaas, together with his father, who had been arrested, (but made sure Munthe-Kaas was transferred to the hospital ), went to neutral Sweden and then traveled back to Britain.Christensen, p. 103–108.Rørholt and Thorsen, p. 164–165. He was later followed by his father, who eventually became the Norwegian military attache in Washington, DC. In October 1942 Munthe-Kaas was involved in Operation Upsilon, and in mid-November he was together with other Norwegian soldiers and 60 tons of equipment, brought over to Mefjorden on Senja by the French submarine Junon.Christensen, p. 116–130.Rørholt and Thorsen, p. 167–165. On his return to Britain, he began work at the Norwegian Military Academy in London in December 1942, where he continued until early 1943.Christensen, p. 136. =The second half of the war= Munthe-Kaas was sent to Norway once more in March 1943, again with the Junon, during Upsilon III.Christensen, p. 147. The objective of the operation was to deliver a further 60 tons of supplies, and bring out two French and two Norwegian soldiers who had been left in Mefjorden during the previous raid.Christensen, p. 147–152.Rørholt and Thorsen, p. 239. These four had managed to remain hidden with the help of residents in Mefjordvær. The rescue of the four was considered a significant achievement and resulted in that Munthe-Kaas was rewarded a distinction, both from Norway, France and the United Kingdom. The repeated missions in occupied Norway posed a risk both for himself and for the intelligence service. As a result, Munthe-Kaas was transferred to another service in 1943. After the Military Academy, he continued with British military training and was transferred to the Westminster Dragoons, where he was a tank commander, but he was not sent on active service.Christensen, p. 154. In early 1944, Munthe-Kaas reported for duty with the Royal Norwegian Navy in the United Kingdom, where he was stationed aboard the motor torpedo boat MTB 627, which served in the English Channel.Christensen, p. 155–158. During the Normandy Landings in June 1944 Munthe-Kaas' motor torpedo boat was part of the naval force which protected the invasion fleet against German attacks. He continued motor torpedo boat service until September, when he was again assigned to a mission in Norway. It was led by Major Paul M. Strande and bore the code-name Elg. The base would be ready for combat in case of an Allied invasion in Norway, or in the case if the German forces in Norway decided to fight rather than surrender.Christensen, p. 161. Together with other Norwegian soldiers, Munthe-Kaas was paradropped over Eastern Norway on 26 November 1944. Munthe-Kaas was assigned head of the area BA I and was at Elg until Germany's capitulation. At war's end, Munthe-Kaas had risen through the ranks to lieutenant. =Post-war= After the end of the war in 1945, Munthe-Kaas became a civilian and worked at the herring oil factory in Tromsø, where his father was the manager for many years.Astrid Karlsen Scott: Silent patriot. Norway's most highly decorated World War II soldier and secret agent. A true story, Olympia, Washington: Nordic Adventures, 2004, p. 241. However, he soon went back to the military, achieving a number of key positions in the army. He served as an intelligence officer in Northern Norway and later served in the same role in the Independent Norwegian Brigade Group in Germany. In 1949 he was stationed in London, where he served as assistant military attaché at the Norwegian embassy. From 1950 to 1952 he was the Norwegian military attaché in the United Kingdom. Munthe-Kaas participated as part of the Norwegian military delegation, in the funeral procession of King George VI of the United Kingdom in London on 15 February 1952.London Gazette, Supplement, no. 39575, 17 June 1952, p. 3359. Upon returning to Norway he was appointed head of Garnisonen i Sør-Varanger and was from 1955 to 1960 assistant border commissioner. He also served abroad on several occasions, including as an assistant to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe in Paris in 1962. From 1963 to 1964 he participated in Norwegian UN troops in Congo.Scott, p. 242. In 1965 he was stationed at Heistadmoen, before he became chief of the army's paratrooper school at Trandum, where he served from 1969 until 1972.Scott, p. 245. He resigned from the Armed Forces in 1983. Awards For his efforts during Upsilon III, when a Sergeant, Munthe-Kaas was honoured by the King in Council with the Norwegian War Cross with sword on 2 July 1943.Erik Gjems- Onstad (ed.): Krigskorset og St. Olavsmedaljen med ekegren, Oslo: Grøndahl Dreyer, 1995, p. 106-107. The citation mentioned in particular the efforts to rescue two French and two Norwegian soldiers during the operation with the French submarine Junon. The diploma accompanying the War Cross was labeled \\"For particularly deserving effort in connection with secret military operations\\". France honoured him with the appointment of Chevalier (Knight) of the Légion d'honneur and he was also awarded the Croix de guerre with bronze palm.Christensen, p. 151. In 1943 he was awarded the British Distinguished Service Medal, an award that was presented by the First Sea Lord, John Cunningham.Christensen, p. 152. This was the highest British award available at the time for non-commissioned military personnel.

The Delicious One is an anthropomorphic chili dog. Almost everybody wants to eat the Delicious One due to him being a hot dog, and the Delicious One's famous trademark is when he runs off screaming.'The Delicious One' speaks in new TV spots for Wienerschnitzel It is currently unknown when Wienerschnitzel will do new commercials featuring the Delicious One. History Wienerschnitzel has also created antennas with the Delicious One on them holding a small, yellow box with a scared look on his face (there are also alternate versions of this antenna {one with the Delicious One wearing an Uncle Sam hat}). First starting in 2011, Wienerschnitzel released new antennas known as the Golden Wienie. Television advertisements In the commercials featuring the Delicious One, the Wienerschnitzel slogan \\"The World's Most Wanted Wiener\\" (which is also one of the alternative names for the Delicious One) is used. This is an outdated slogan, and the only time it is used now is in those commercials. However, most Wienerschnitzel commercials lately haven't featured the Delicious One. Wienerschnitzel never aired TDO commercials in 2011, but it is the creator Luke Thomas if they'll do 2012 TDO commercials. Here are the commercials with the Delicious One: * \\"Tea party\\": TDO runs into a little girl's bedroom and hides in her closet. She then wakes up, and, upon discovering him, decides to have a tea party with him. Her parents then enter, and when she asks them if they can keep TDO, the father replies, \\"Oh, yeah. We can keep him.\\" However, upon realizing that the father wants to eat him, TDO gasps wide-eyed, drops his cup of tea, and runs off screaming in terror. * \\"Hawaii\\": TDO is on vacation at Hawaii, when a boat sails by and the driver tells his crew that they can now find their own food. This makes TDO spit his drink out, get off his hammock, and run off (but ends up crashing into a palm tree). * \\"Saloon\\": TDO enters a saloon and says to the bartender, \\"Hey, it says on the door that you serve hot dogs!\\" The bartender then puts a jar of mustard next to TDO and replies, \\"We do.\\" Realizing that the man's gonna try and eat him, TDO runs off screaming in terror. * \\"Imposter\\":http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030227005650/en/Wienerschnitzels- Delicious-Spots-Imposter-TV-Ad * \\"Chili\\": TDO dances to promote Wienerschnitzel's new chili. Then he says, \\"Yum. Chili.\\"HighBeam * \\"Exercise\\": TDO is exercising in his house, then goes outside and goes on a \\"jog\\" by having people run after him. * \\"Blubber\\": TDO is sick of just having blubber with eskimos and suggests they have something spicy and hot. One of the eskimos then ask TDO (wide-eyed), \\"Like a chili dog?\\", to which TDO says yes, but after realizing his error, says no and that blubber's better. This causes the hot dog to run away screaming. * \\"Human Resources\\": TDO is at work complaining to the Human Resources manager about him constantly being harassed at work. While his co-workers make obscene gestures to him outside the office, after TDO asks the manager what she's gonna do about it, she replies, \\"Honestly... I'd say you're asking for it!\\" and closes the blinds on the two men, and TDO's scream can be heard. The chili dog then flees, screaming (like he always does). * \\"Predator\\": A spoof of To Catch a Predator. A man named Josh is expecting a date, but instead finds a man and a camera crew, and the man asks him embarrassing questions and finds ketchup and mustard jars in his backpack, and when asked if there was relish in the car, Josh nervously replies, \\"Yeah.\\" * \\"Gotcha\\" (2008): TDO is running from a young woman in a college dorm and crawls under the door into a student's room and hides under the bed's blankets and is almost caught by the girl, who ends up grabbing a sleeping man's crotch. This results in the girl, man, and TDO screaming in terror together. TDO then flees, screaming in terror. * \\"Play Me\\": TDO dances to The Chubbies' song \\"Play Me\\" to promote Wienerschnitzel's new chili cheeseburger and chili cheese dog, which are both covered in cheese and smothered in chili.

A series of tunnels (Kuhrang Tunnels) have been built since the 1950s to redirect some of the Kuhrang's water toward the Zayandeh River to meet the demands of increased population in Esfahan and Yazd provinces. The Zayandeh River basin encompasses about and is connected to the upper Karun River basin (which drains to the Persian Gulf) by the Kuhrang Dam and Tunnel 1 () constructed in 1953 although first proposed in the early sixteenth century. Two additional tunnels (Kurang 2 and Kurang 3) were constructed in late 1990s and early 2000s. A hydroelectric dam at Godar-e Langar (also known as Karun-4) would also supply piped water to Esfahan away if it is completed (Whitley and Gallagher, 1995). Dams have deleterious effects on a riverine fish and other fauna and are often stocked with exotic species. The upper Karun has not been well explored for endemic taxa. Mean annual flow of the Zayandeh River is estimated at and is used mostly for agriculture, but an increase in population and industry has necessitated dam construction (Chadegan Reservoir, capacity ) and diversion schemes.

The museum is known for its collection of 20th-century art and includes Western-style and Nihonga artists. History The National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, was the first National Museum of Art in Japan and dates back to 1952, when it was established as an institution governed by the Ministry of Education. The architect of the building was Kunio Maekawa. On two later occasions, neighbouring premises were purchased and the Museum was further enlarged. The most recent re-design of MOMAT was conceived by Yoshirō Taniguchi (father of Yoshio Taniguchi who designed the extension of MOMA in New York). Collections The collection contains many notable Japanese artists since the Meiji period as well as a few contemporary Western prints. In the early years of the 20th century, Matsukata Kojiro collected Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints which had been scattered throughout the world. The 1925 exhibition of the woodblock prints Matsukata collected abroad is thought to have been the first of its kind in Japan.Checkland, Olive. (2002). Japan and Britain After 1859: Creating Cultural Bridges, p. 107. Today approximately 8,000 ukiyo-e prints from the Matsukata collection are housed in the Tokyo National Museum. NMWA collection =Crafts Gallery= In 1977, the museum opened an annex, the Kōgeikan Crafts Gallery, that collects and exhibits textiles, ceramics, lacquer, and other Japanese crafts as well as craft and design from around the world dating from the late 19th century to the present. Its collection focus in particular is the work of Japanese Living National Treasures. The Crafts Gallery maintains its own research library. =National Film Center= Up until April 2018, the National Museum of Modern Art housed the National Film Center (NFC), which was Japan's only public institution devoted to cinema. In April 2018, the NFC became independent of the Art Museum and was officially elevated to the rank of a national museum under the name the National Film Archive of Japan. =Union catalog= The \\"Union Catalog of the Collections of the National Art Museums, Japan\\" is a consolidated catalog of material held by the four Japanese national art museums—the National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto (MOMAK), the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo (MOMAT), the National Museum of Art in Osaka (NMAO), and the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo (NMWA): IAI-National Museums of Art union catalog * National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto (MOMAK).

He is a member of the Liberal Party and has been Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment in the Morrison Government since 2018. He previously served as Minister for Education and Training in the Turnbull Government from 2015 to 2018, and as a parliamentary secretary and assistant minister in the Abbott Government. In October 2020, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Birmingham will become the Leader of the Government in the Senate upon the resignation of Minister for Finance Mathias Cormann. Early life and career Birmingham grew up on his family's horse agistment property near Gawler, South Australia. He was educated at Gawler High School and the University of Adelaide; neither of his parents had attended university. He has cited his grandmother Madge Herde, a school principal, as a key influence in his decision to enter politics. Birmingham was named South Australia's Lions Club Youth of the Year in 1992 and awarded the Town of Gawler's Australia Day Young Citizen of the Year Award in 1993. He holds a Master of Business Administration from the Adelaide Graduate School of Business, University of Adelaide. He began his career working as an electorate officer for Senator Robert Hill. In 1997 Birmingham moved from federal to state politics, working as a ministerial advisor to Joan Hall. Early in 2000 Birmingham moved to Canberra to become the national manager of public affairs for the Australian Hotels Association. In late 2001, Birmingham was appointed chief of staff to the South Australian state minister for tourism and innovation, Martin Hamilton-Smith. Following a change of government in 2002, Birmingham began work with the Winemakers' Federation of Australia where he remained until his appointment to the Senate in 2007. Political career At the age of 29, Birmingham won Liberal Party preselection for the marginal seat of Hindmarsh at the 2004 federal election following the retirement of sitting member Chris Gallus. The seat was narrowly won by Labor's Steve Georganas.Australian Electoral Commission, S.A Division—Hindmarsh, 2004 election tally After an unsuccessful attempt to fill the vacancy created by Robert Hill's retirement from the Senate in 2006, Birmingham won Liberal Party preselection as a Senate candidate in 2007 federal election and was elected for a six-year term. However, he entered the Senate earlier, being appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Jeannie Ferris. At the time of his appointment on 3 May 2007, Birmingham was the youngest member of the Australian Senate. He is identified with the moderate wing of the Liberal Party. Birmingham served on Senate Environment, Communications, and Arts Committees from May 2007 to February 2010, the Senate Select Committee on the National Broadband Network as well as the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties from 2007 to September 2012.

Udgorn Seion was the successor publication to Prophwyd y Jubili, which was the first Welsh-language Latter Day Saint periodical. In the final edition of Prophwyd y Jubili, editor Dan Jones announced that he would be returning to the United States and that the church publication would be renamed Udgorn Seion. The editor for the renamed publication was John Davis, a wealthy Latter Day Saint bachelor. Originally, Udgorn Seion was published monthly, like its predecessor. In 1851, it began to be issued biweekly and in 1858 it became a weekly. When Dan Jones returned to Wales for his second mission, he became the new editor of the publication. Subsequent editors were Daniel Daniels, Benjamin Evans, and George Q. Cannon. Udgorn Seion was published on presses in a variety of locations, including at Carmarthen, Merthyr Tydfil and Swansea in Wales and at Liverpool in England. Circulation for Udgorn Seion peaked at about 2000 during Davis's tenure as editor and was at about 500 for the three years prior to its demise in 1862. Its readership was continually diminished by Latter-day Saint emigration to Utah. In 1862, editor (and head of the LDS Church in Europe) George Q. Cannon decided to suspend publication and encourage Welsh speaking Latter-day Saints to read the English-language Millennial Star.

Within the UFO community, he is often regarded as one of the preeminent experts on the reported crash of a UFO near Roswell, New Mexico in July 1947. A professional writer with more than 80 books to his credit, Randle is perhaps best known for his books about UFOs and the Roswell story. While the vast majority of his books are science fiction and historical fiction, it's his books on the accounts of the Roswell story, New Mexico in 1947 that have exerted an enormous influence on those interested in the saga. Randle, along with Stanton Friedman, is generally acknowledged as one of the leading researchers into the Roswell story and the UFO question. He continues to work in the UFO field, although lately he has concentrated more on his science fiction books than UFO research. He is also the brother of Brian D. Platt. Military service A military veteran, Kevin Randle served in the United States Army during both the Vietnam War and the Iraq War. In Vietnam, Randle piloted UH-1 helicopters while assigned to the 116th Assault Helicopter Company based at Cu Chi, and later with the 187th Assault Helicopter Company stationed at Tay Ninh. Between the Vietnam War and the War in Iraq, Randle was in the United States Air Force, both on active duty and in the active reserves. In the Air Force, Randle pulled duty as a public affairs officer, a general’s aide, and an intelligence officer. He was promoted several times and completed his Air Force Reserve duty as a captain and the director of intelligence for an airlift group. After the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, Randle joined the Iowa National Guard as an intelligence officer. His unit, the 234th Signal Battalion, deployed in Iraq in June 2003, to the Baghdad International Airport, returning in May 2004. Randle was awarded a Combat Action Badge for his participation in several firefights in Iraq.On A Different Perspective: A Personal Note Randle retired from the Iowa National Guard as a lieutenant colonel in 2009. Education Randle studied journalism at the University of Iowa (BA). He earned a master's degree in psychology, as well as a Ph.D. from California Coast University and a second master's degree in military studies, from the American Military University. Writing career Randle began his study of UFOs while still a high school student. In 1972 he published his first article about UFOs in Saga’s Annual UFO Report. Throughout the 1970s, he published a number of articles concerning a variety of UFO sightings including tales of alien abduction, photographic cases, and those involving some sort of physical evidence. In 1975 he was asked by Jim Lorenzen to investigate the wave of cattle mutilations that were sweeping the Midwest and west. Randle’s writing is not limited to the UFO field. He is the author of more than 100 books including action-adventure, mysteries, and science fiction. He has also written more than two hundred magazine articles including his exploration of Iowa’s Coldwater Cave and accounts of the war in Vietnam. A magazine article in Soldier of Fortune magazine recounted an Easter Sunday (2004) firefight that took place on the western perimeter of Baghdad Airport.Soldier of Fortune: Firefight at BIAP. Feb 2005 Page 38 Interviewed by Skeptical Inquirer's Robert Sheaffer Randle is asked about his current status of belief in UFOs. When asked what does he think is credible evidence for the existence of UFOs, he stated that he believes that a UFO crashed in Roswell, and that possibly there may be truth to the story that a UFO crashed in Shag Harbour in 1967. But Randle feels that most abductees are \\"describing sleep paralysis\\"...\\"many of these supposed abductees are very impressionable and are easily led by a hypnotist\\". About ongoing research for proof of aliens, \\"...we said this field...had not progressed in over twenty years. It's now been another ten or twelve years, and it still has not progressed.\\" In conclusion Randle says, \\"I set a very high bar for the level of evidence required. There are very few authentic UFO cases. However, some skeptical explanations don't fit the facts. Still, I'm getting more skeptical in my old age.\\" In the opinion of interviewer Sheaffer, Randle \\"gives more weight to 'eyewitness testimony' than skeptics typically do.\\" In a later interview with Sheaffer, Randle indicated, with regard to Roswell, that \\"he was no longer sure what actually happened, and that he feels the case for ET involvement is no longer robust.\\" Bibliography =Works about UFOs= *\\" Roswell in the 21st Century: the Evidence as it Exists Today\\" (2016) *The Abduction Enigma with William P.

The current line-up includes Nick Farrugia (vocals), Melchior Borg (vocals), David Depasquale (guitars), Max Vassallo (drums) and Claudio Toscano (bass). They are considered to have played an important role in establishing the Maltese Extreme Death metal genre. History =Early years (2000-2002)= Abysmal Torment hails from the island of Malta, and emerged in 2000 as a violent death metal band under the name Molested. Although undergoing various line up changes, Abysmal Torment performed their first notable stage gig for the first time in 2002. The band writes music reliant on speed stimulated tempos, breakdowns, technical riffing and a dual assault of varying gurgling vocals. Their music also features dark lyrical content, often including themes of death and gore. =Incised Wound Suicide (2002-2005)= Abysmal Torment began recording at Temple Studios for the first time in 2004 to record their debut album entitled Insiced Wound Suicide, which was described as consisting of five “drum kit mashing, guitar shredding, vocal chord wrecking ultra fucking brutal death metal” tracks. The album received many encouraging reviews and signed a 3-year album deal with the underground label Brutal Bands in the United States. Their first release under Brutal Bands was the re-release of Incised Wound Suicide. =Epoch Of Methodic Carnage (2005-2007)= The band released their second studio album, Epoch of Methodic Carnage, in February 2006 on Brutal Records. The album included 10 brand new tracks which were recorded once again at Temple Studios with producer David Vella, and featured artwork from Tony Koehl. The album was distributed through major labels in Europe, the United States, and the rest of the world. Summer 2006 was a huge disappointment for Abysmal Torment as they were forced to cancel a full blown American tour with Beneath the Massacre, Neuraxis and Victimas plus well known festivals such as The Gathering of the Sick and Central Illinois Metal Fest. In August 2007, Abysmal Torment traveled to Italy for the South Extreme Noise Festival and later traveled Europe with a 23 date tour throughout 12 countries together with Sanatorium, headlining fests such as the Ludwigshafen Deathfest, Slovak Deathfest and Luzern Deathfest. A short while after this tour, the band flew to the Netherlands to headline yet another deathfest, the Drachten Deathfest. =Omnicide (2008-2010)= The band recorded their 3rd and highly anticipated album, Omnicide, this time at SpineSplitter Studios. In addition, they appeared in a number of European shows and also headlined the Hellvetia Festival in Switzerland. Omnicide was then released and distributed worldwide under Brutal Bands in April 2009. The band embarked on a second European Tour in 2009 supporting the release of Omnicide together with Insidious Discrepancy and Cerebral Bore. During this period, Abysmal Torment played what some consider to be their best shows to date at the NRW Deathfest in Germany with Sinister and Ghoul, Meh Suff metal-fest in Switzerland together with Belphegor and Debauchery and the Way of Darkness festival in Germany, together with death metal bands such as Cannibal Corpse, Vader, Marduk, Dying Fetus and Malevolent Creation. In 2010 the band also performed at various European Festivals, namely the renowned Open Air Deathfest in Hunxe, Germany and Neurotic Deathfest in the Netherlands in 2010. On 17 August 2010, Abysmal Torment received the news that former drummer Wayne Vella died in an accident at his place of work. He was featured on all three Abysmal Torment releases. The band immediately issued a statement on their official pages confirming the tragedy; > Today is a sad day for us all. Unfortunately we have lost our brother Wayne > Vella (Drummer in Abysmal Torment from 2001–2008) who had just turned 25. He > will be remembered by us as a great friend & excellent drummer. We will > never forget the great times we shared together & all the awesome > experiences. May he rest in peace... & hope he is in a better place. > Condolences to all his loved ones! Much respect, Abysmal Torment! = 2011 - 2014 = Abysmal Torment headlined two tours in 2011, Butchers on the Road Tour in Russia and the Supreme Tyrant in Europe Tour. Later that year, Gordon Formosa quit the band after being a member for more than 10 years. The band recruited two new members, Melchior Borg on vocals, and the addition of a second guitarist, Kurt Pace. Abysmal Torment went on to play at numerous festivals in Europe, including Mountains of Death in Switzerland, the first annual Malta Deathfest and returned once again to The Way of Darkness. = Cultivate The Apostate (2014 - 2018) = Abysmal Torment's 3rd full-length studio album was released for the first time under Willowtip Records. Cultivate the Apostate was recorded at SpineSplitter Studio and mixed and mastered by 16th Cellar Studio. Album concept and art was handled by Michal Loranc. During this period, Abysmal Torment embarked on touring around Europe on numerous occasions, playing festivals such as, Berlin Deathfest, Carnage Feast, Monthly Assault and once again played the NRW Deathfest. Soon after the touring cycle, Kurt Pace parted ways with the band on amicable terms. Meanwhile, the rest of the band carried on writing and producing new material in preparation for the follow up to Cultivate the Apostate. = The Misanthrope (2018-present) = On 1 February 2018, Abysmal Torment announced, via their Facebook page, the completion of the new album which would be titled The Misanthrope, set to be released on 21 September of the same year. The Misanthrope was recorded, mixed and mastered at SpineSplitter Studio. Photography for the Cover Art was taken by Lee Jeffries and additional editing carried out by Michal Loranc. On 21 July 2018, the band released the track titled Squalid Thoughts as a teaser prior to the full release and was well received upon its release. For The Misanthrope, Abysmal Torment switched to 8 string guitars, which would result in the band further downtuning and adding a punchier and a deeper layered sound which would serve their musical style better. Amidst news on the upcoming release and preparations for live duties, the band parted ways with their longstanding bassist Karl Romano. On 3 August, Claudio Toscano was announced as having joined the band to fill in bass duties for the upcoming endeavours. On 11 September the band released their first official music video for the album's title track, The Misanthrope, which was soon followed by the official release on the full album.

The term \\"software system\\" should be distinguished from the terms \\"computer program\\" and \\"software\\". The term computer program generally refers to a set of instructions (source, or object code) that perform a specific task.

Takang 2003 01631469717 pages 7-8 The use of the term software system is at times related to the application of systems theory approaches in the context of software engineering. A software system consists of several separate computer programs and associated configuration files, documentation, etc., that operate together. The concept is used in the study of large and complex software, because it focuses on the major components of software and their interactions. It is also related to the field of software architecture. Software systems are an active area of research for groups interested in software engineering in particular and systems engineering in general. Academic journals like the Journal of Systems and Software (published by Elsevier) are dedicated to the subject. The ACM Software System Award is an annual award that honors people or an organization \\"for developing a system that has had a lasting influence, reflected in contributions to concepts, in commercial acceptance, or both\\". It has been awarded by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) since 1983, with a cash prize sponsored by IBM. Categories Major categories of software systems include those based on application software development, programming software, and system software although the distinction can sometimes be difficult.

It is the fourth book in the Wess'Har Series, following The World Before and preceding Ally. Plot summary Mohan Rayat and Lindsay Neville have been sent to the bottom of the ocean, after having been infected with c'naatat in the World Before, to spend forever living with the bezeri to help them rebuild and recover. But first they must undergo cellular reconstruction in order to survive in the depths, which happens at an astounding rate. Ade Bennett and Aras have the unpleasant duty to tell Shan Frankland, their isan, what they did. Since Shan threw herself into deep space to keep c'naatat from Rayat and Earth's government, she was not pleased that the symbiont was just given to them. She tells Esganikan of the Eqbas Vorhi about the development and she agrees to take precautions against it being spread. Neville and Rayat are changed people, literally. They have developed gills and can sense their surroundings using sonar. The bezeri have put them to work extracting maps from a contaminated zone that the bezeri cannot enter. Rayat wants to acquire the bioluminescence ability that Shan has so he can try to communicate with the bezeri without the aid of the translation lamp. Shan had acquired bioluminescence in a previous encounter and passed that on to Ade. He in turn would have passed that on to Rayat and Neville when he infected them but this has not manifested itself. In an effort to make it manifest, Rayat asks for cells from the bezeri. The matriarch of the group brings the body of a youth that has recently died and Rayat and Lindsay put some of its tissue and blood into their own bloodstream. Ade, Shan and Eddie have gone with the Eqbas to visit Umeh. While there, Shan and Ade finally consummate their relationship. The Eqbas are attacked by the Maritime Fringe, a neighboring state of Jejeno, but the attack causes no damage to the Eqbas and the Eqbas retaliate swiftly by destroying most of the far city of Buyg. They all take a trip in the Eqbas ship to visit that city and determine if they are now willing to cooperate. The Maritime Fringe responds with ineffective violence which is met with return fire from the Eqbas. Ade has noticed that his bioluminescence and Shan's seem to respond to each other and to other lights. He thinks the possibility exists that c'naatat is sentient and is communicating. Others don't want to think of that as possible so they are avoiding the issue. Shan calls Aras to let him know they are coming back to Wess'ej and discover that Vijissi, who was thrown into space with Shan because he refused to abandon her, has been found and is alive—infected with c'naatat.

It raged from April to June 2007 and ultimately merging with other fires becoming the largest fire in the history of both Georgia and Florida. The Bugaboo, which was not actually named until it had blazed for nearly a month, started in the Okefenokee Swamp, most of which is located in Georgia. It merged with the Sweat Farm Road Fire creating the largest south GA fire in documented history. It was the culmination of several converging fires. Georgia On April 16, a downed power line started the Sweat Farm Road fire southwest of Waycross. When it entered the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge on April 21, it was renamed Big Turnaround. Close by, the Bugaboo fire was ignited by lightning on May 5. By May 20, the fires converged and became the Georgia Bay Complex - one of the largest fires in the South and the nation. This fire started when a tree fell on a power line on April 16, during high winds (caused by the April 2007 nor'easter and a strong high- pressure system), and low humidity along with drought conditions. By April 30, it had burned about 80,000 acres (320 km²)—about 20% of which was in the refuge—and had also destroyed 22 homes, and forced the evacuations of over 1,000 people. A fire break long was bulldozed through the pine forest to protect the city of Waycross, but there were breaches of the line. The governor of Georgia made a disaster declaration, making Ware and Brantley counties eligible for government aid. Smoke closed several roads in the area, including U.S. 1. By May 9, the main fire had consumed over 116,000 acres (469 km²), mainly south of Waycross, east of Fargo and west of Folkston in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. Many cities were threatened, but were never under siege. Subtropical Storm Andrea—which some had hoped might bring relief—apparently exacerbated the situation, as it drove strong winds into the fire but brought very little rain. These winds may have been the reason that the fire then blew across the border into northeast Florida. Florida On May 8, the Bugaboo fire was started by lightning at Bugaboo Island in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, and soon crept over the state line into Florida (and hence became the retronymed Bugaboo Scrub fire). It expanded extraordinarily quickly, combining with other fires that were already blazing in Georgia, and by May 16 had grown to 120,000 acres (490 km²). By May 22 it had burned 475,000 acres (1,920 km²) in Georgia and Florida. By the end of May had burned. The Florida Folk Festival, the nation's oldest continuous festival, was cancelled for the first time because of the fire. (It was later re-scheduled for November.) The major fire which entered from Georgia caused closures of Interstate 75 from the state line (and at times as far north as Valdosta) to Interstate 10. I-10 also had sections closed as well, sometimes as long as 40 mile (65 km). The detour by the Georgia State Patrol and Florida Highway Patrol doubled the distance to travel between Valdosta and Gainesville (from to 180) and tripled the time normally required to make the trip. Hundreds were evacuated from homes in Columbia County, Florida late on May 10, and a state of emergency was declared.  The reach of the smoke  During the time these fires were burning, thick, sooty smoke blanketed the city of Jacksonville, Florida and the entire area of northeast Florida and southeast Georgia for many days. At times, the smoke reduced visibility to under a quarter of a mile and caused many health concerns. On May 22, 2007, from southern Georgia to Metro Atlanta, residents awoke to a blanket of smoke across the horizon. A strong smoke smell was very clear, and there were reports of people with irritated eyes, noses, and lungs. Some people with asthma were rushed to hospitals as a result of the smoke. Smoke at times reduced visibility as far south as central Florida, and was even blown all the way down to Fort Lauderdale in south Florida, putting the local air quality index in the unhealthy range. Smoke later drifted across southern Alabama and even to Meridian, Mississippi.Wildfire Smoke Drifts Across State Lines By June 22, the wildfires in Georgia were largely contained. The containment came after beneficial, heavy rain blanketed the region from Tropical Storm Barry in June 2007.

They were designated and primarily funded by the federal government, with road standards and numbering handled by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) These highways connect every city in the state with a population of over 100,000 (Seattle, Spokane, Tacoma, Vancouver, Bellevue, and Everett) as well as the state capital, Olympia.

One route, I-605, has been proposed over the years to form another Eastside bypass, however there are no plans to construct this fifth auxiliary route. __TOC__  Primary Interstate Highways  After passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, which formed the Interstate Highway System, the American Association of State Highway Officials had approved I-5 and I-90 across Washington on August 17, 1957. I-82 was approved on October 17, 1957, two months after I-5 and I-90, as part of a addition to the Interstate Highway System. All three highways were designated as \\"Washington green highways\\" in 2007 to promote alternatives to fossil fuels, including electric charging stations installed on I-5 in 2012.  Auxiliary Interstate Highways  I-205 and I-405 were first codified into Washington State Law in 1970, and I-182 and I-705 were codified in 1979. I-705 was completed in 1988, after a series of federal budget cuts, and was the last Interstate Highway to be completed in the state of Washington.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 3,030. Milton is part of the Lafayette Metropolitan Statistical Area. History It is unknown when the village of Milton was first settled. Old land claims show that much of the town is on land once owned by Bernard, son of Ashnoya, a leader of the Atakapa people. The area served as a river crossing and a trade center for the farms and cattle ranches that lined both sides of the Vermilion River. The earliest settlers were Acadian families. Early landowners in the area included Francois Broussard, son of Joseph Broussard dit Beausoleil; Jean Bernard; Pierre Vincent; Michel Meaux; Jean- Baptiste Trahan; and Joseph Boudreaux. Jean-Jacques Denais operated a ferry at the townsite in the early 19th century. Désiré Broussard and Jean-Baptiste Montet settled there by 1823. Anselm Thibodeaux, who settled on land on the east bank of the river, cultivated it for at least 20 years prior to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Anselm's Coulee, named for him, runs through the area. Vermilion River bridge in Milton Beausoleil Broussard's descendants Eloi Broussard and Darmas Broussard owned and operated a store during the steamboat era. They built a two-story home on the east side of the river in the late 1880s. The home stands at a bridge there today. A ferry operated at the Milton site probably as early as 1820. At the December 14, 1897, meeting of the Vermilion Parish Police Jury, it was suggested that a bridge be built across the river there. That bridge was dedicated on February 2, 1902. The present bridge was built in 1948. In 1885, Milton R. Cushman came to the area to practice medicine. Dr. Cushman petitioned for a post office at the Desire Broussard place and became the first postmaster there. The mail was left at his medical office. When postal officials asked for a name for the locale, Dr. Cushman's wife decided upon Milton—the name of her husband and of her son, Milton S. Cushman, who was born in 1890. Geography Milton is in southern Lafayette Parish, on the east side of the Vermilion River, which forms the Vermilion Parish line. It is south of Lafayette, the Lafayette parish seat, and north of Abbeville, the Vermilion parish seat.

It facilitates RAID5 functionality without the need of a hardware RAID controller. geom_raid5 allows storage of large amounts of data to be protected against disk failure, while providing good throughput performance. Like other FreeBSD storage modules, geom_raid5 utilizes the GEOM framework. It is built as a kernel loadable module (KLD) which allows it to run inside the FreeBSD kernel. The module can be compiled on FreeBSD release 5 and newer releases. geom_raid5 is also incorporated into FreeNAS, an operating system dedicated to Network Attached Storage. Its author, Arne Woerner, has released the software under the BSD license, making geom_raid5 OSI-compliant open source software.  Comparing to other Software RAID5 solutions  geom_raid5 distinguishes itself by providing both advanced features and high performance. While the theoretical maximum write speed is · ( \\\\- 1), the latest version is able to achieve about 80% of that theoretical maximum. This is in huge contrast with other software RAID5 solutions which sometimes achieve less than 10% of that throughput combined with significantly higher CPU utilization. The reason for this huge difference lies in geom_raid5's design. In order to write data to a RAID5 volume, data must often first be read in order to calculate the parity information that protects against data loss in case of a single disk failure. Using request combining a full stripe block can be 'collected' so a read is no longer required. This means the harddrive heads do not need to change position every time but can write data contiguously, theoretically at full speed. Of course, this only works with sequential transfers and sometimes even then the filesystem does not write contiguously. But using request combining, geom_raid5 manages to outperform any software RAID5 solution to date, capable of reaching write-speeds associated with hardware RAID5 on budget-level x86 hardware. Currently the module is being finalized. When a stable version is released the author will release further information about its design and disclose benchmarks. In particular, benchmarks showing geom_raid5 performance versus ZFS's RAID-Z are long-awaited by users. Variants Various incarnations of geom raid5 exist which trade off speed for memory usage. * geom_raid5 The most stable version but slower than the other variants in certain cases * geom_raid5 TNG Uses more memory to deliver better transfer rates * geom_raid5 PP Memory usage and speed is in between the TNG and PP.

He was the only Chief Justice of New South Wales to be appointed and resign before he was ever sworn into office. Salomons was said to be short of stature and somewhat handicapped by defective eyesight. However, he had great industry, great powers of analysis, a keen intellect and unbounded energy and pertinacity. His wit and readiness were proverbial, and he was afraid of no judge. Early years Salomons was born at Edgbaston, Warwickshire, England, on 4 November 1835 as Julian Emanuel Solomons. He came to Australia aged 16 years on board the Atalanta on 4 September 1853. He was employed in a book shop and as a stockbroker's clerk. In 1855 he was appointed the secretary of the Great Synagogue at Sydney. After passing the preliminary examination of the Barristers Admission Board (now the Legal Profession Admission Board) in 1857, he returned to England in 1858 where he entered Gray's Inn and was called to the bar on 26 January 1861. He returned to Sydney and was admitted to the New South Wales Bar on 8 July 1861 and then returned to England to marry his cousin, Louisa Solomons, at Lower Edmonton, Middlesex, England, on 17 December 1862. Salomons was Jewish and an active member of the Jewish community. Legal career He returned to Sydney after his marriage and managed a successful practice as a barrister. He first made a reputation in criminal cases. He had great industry, great powers of analysis, a keen intellect and unbounded energy and pertinacity. However, his passion for work probably led to a decline in his health and he made frequent trips to Europe to recover from these bouts. One of the significant cases he was involved with was the case of Louis Bertrand who was sentenced to death on a charge of murder. Bertrand came to be known as the \\"Mad Dentist of Wynyard Square\\". Bertrand had tried to kill Henry Kinder, the husband of his mistress Ellen Kinder on a number of occasions. Bertrand finally shot him, but his shot failed to kill. However, his actions persuaded his mistress to poison Kinder. This was successful. In 1866 Bertrand was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. His mistress was discharged on account of a lack of evidence. Salomons was instructed after the trial and was able to eventually convince the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales that Bertrand should have a new trial. The decision was tied with two judges for a new trial and two judges against. One judge subsequently retracted his judgment resulting in a win for Salomons. Rather bullishly, Salomons after winning the appeal went further to argue that the judge could not retract his judgment in law. Luckily for his client, the court held that it could and the order for retrial stood. However, the court's decision for a new trial was subsequently overturned on appeal to the Privy Council on the basis that the Supreme Court could not make such an order. The New South Wales Governor commuted Bertrand's sentence to life. Royal commissioner In 1870 Salomons was a member of the Law Reform Commission. The purpose of a law reform commission is to make recommendations on updating and changing laws. On 16 August 1881 he was appointed a royal commissioner to inquire into the affairs of the Milburn Creek Copper Mining Co Ltd. Salomons reported on 3 March 1881 that 'there was an appropriation by the trustees themselves, not only without the consent or knowledge of their co- shareholders, but under circumstances of concealment and false statement, evidencing a consciousness on their part, that such appropriation was unauthorised and unjustifiable'. The report was to lead to Ezekiel Alexander Baker, a member of parliament and one of the trustees, being expelled from Parliament. First parliamentary career Salomons unsuccessfully ran for parliament in 1869 and instead became Solicitor General in December of that year. He held that position for nearly a year until Sir Charles Cowper took over from Sir John Robertson as premier. He was appointed as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, a position he held for six months, before resigning on 14 February 1871. Appointment as chief justice Salomons advocacy had earned him a huge reputation. When Chief Justice Sir James Martin died, the position was first offered to William Bede Dalley and then Frederick Matthew Darley. Both refused. Salomons was then offered the position. After some hesitation, Salomons accepted notwithstanding that it involved a substantial reduction in income. His appointment attracted controversy in some quarters and it was reputed that the other judges of the court were against his appointment. Biographer Percival Serle states that Salomons's response to criticism was that his \\"appointment appears to be so wholly unjustifiable [to Justice William Windeyer ] as to have led to the utterance by him of such expressions and opinions … as to make any intercourse in the future between him and me quite impossible\\". Serle states that each of the judges of the court denied making any such statements. He had general support with most newspapers and from the legal profession. Nevertheless, he decided on 19 November 1886 to resign the position before actually taking the oath of office. He was therefore gazetted as chief justice for only six days, having resigned twelve days after being offered the position. Second parliamentary career He was appointed a second time as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council on 7 March 1887, holding office for over 11 years until 20 February 1899. During that term, he was vice-president of the Executive Council twice, both for nearly a year between 7 March 1887 and 16 January 1889 and then again between 23 October 1891 and 26 January 1893. He was knighted in 1891 during this second vice-presidency. It was during this second term that it is thought that Salomons gave the longest speech in the history of the council. He spoke for approximately eight hours on the Federation Bill. His speech carried over two days on both 28 and 29 July 1897. The Federation Bill was an important issue in the history of the colony of New South Wales as it led to the birth of the nation of Australia. Famous quotes Salomons was reported to have an unusual talent for wit. After the federation of the Australian colonies, the newly established High Court of Australia was said to be routinely overturning decisions of the various Supreme Courts around Australia. Salomons suggested, after appearing before the Supreme Court that the judges of the court should append the following to all Supreme Court judgments: \\"We are unanimously of the opinion that judgment ought to be entered for (let us say) the plaintiff, but to save the trouble and expense to the parties of an appeal to the High Court, we order judgment to be entered for the defendant.\\" On the question of Sir Samuel Griffith's English translation of Dante Alighieri which had received numerous unflattering reviews, it was reported that when Griffith presented a copy to Salomons, the latter asked Griffith to autograph the fly leaf, explaining that \\"I should not like anyone to think that I had borrowed the book, even less should I like anyone to think that I had bought it\\".W.M. Hughes, Policies and Potentates (1950), quoted in: Salomons was a supporter of religion being a moderator of human behaviour. He endowed a local public school on the basis that religion was taught as a subject and was upset when it was not. In an address on Australian Federation, he said that having an \\"education without religion is like putting a sword into the hands of a savage\\". Later life Salomons acted as the agent-general for New South Wales at London between 1899 and April 1900, returning to Sydney the following month. He was also appointed standing counsel for the Commonwealth government in New South Wales in 1903 and all but practically retired from legal practice in 1907. He made a few appearances in court after 1907. He was also a Trustee of Art Gallery of New South Wales and a member of Barristers Admission Board.

Born Maung Biddhu Khyit, he was granted the title of Prince of Pagan by his father Tharrawaddy in August 1842. Pagan Min became king when Tharrawaddy died on 17 November 1846, with the formal title of His Majesty \\"Sri Pawara Vijaya Nanda Jatha Maha Dharma Rajadhiraja Pagan Min Taya- gyi\\". He married 18 times. Pagan Min won the power struggle to succeed his father by having his rival brothers killed. His chief ministers Maung Baing Zat and Maung Bhein enriched themselves by executing rich subjects. The Second Anglo-Burmese War broke out during the reign of Pagan Min. In 1851 the governor of Pegu, Maung Ok, charged the captains of two British merchant ships with murder, embezzlement, and evasion of custom duties. He fined them 500 rupees, and required their debts be paid before being authorized to return to Kolkata. After receiving their complaints, Lord Dalhousie, the governor- general of British India, sent Commodore George Lambert to the king requesting a compensation of £920 and the dismissal of Maung Ok. Pagan complied by replacing Maung Ok. But on 6 January 1852, when the new governor declined to meet with a British delegation because Lambert had seized the Burmese Royal ship, all British subjects were evacuated and the coast of Rangoon was blockaded. Within days, British warships were bombarding Yangon. On 7 February, Pagan wrote Dalhousie to protest against the acts of aggression. On 13 February, Dalhousie sent an ultimatum to the king, demanding an equivalent of £100,000 as compensation for \\"having had to prepare for war\\", to be paid by 1 April. The ultimatum expired with no reply, and a few days later, British troops invaded the Burmese territory. Britain annexed the province of Pegu in December. Pagan Min’s half brother Mindon opposed the war; he fled with his brother Kanaung to Shwebo and raised the standard of rebellion. After a few weeks of fighting, Pagan’s chief minister Magwe Mingyi went over to Mindon’s side and Pagan Min abdicated on 18 February 1853, in favour of Mindon. Mindon allowed Pagan to live, and released all the European prisoners. Mindon sued for peace with the British but refused to sign a treaty ceding Burmese territory.

It has been referred to in United States popular culture since at least the 1880s.Hill, Pamela Smith, editor (2014). Laura Ingalls Wilder Pioneer Girl The Annotated Autobiography. Pierre: South Dakota Historical Society Press. . How to play The group playing is divided into two groups – typically a girls' group and a boys' group. One group goes into another room, such as a bedroom, which is called \\"the post office\\". To play, each person from the outer group individually visits \\"the post office\\". Once there, they get a kiss from everyone in the room. They then return to the original room. Once everyone in the first group has taken a turn, the other group begins sending members to the first room.  Variations  * In the variation \\"Postman's Knock\\", one person chosen by a group to be the \\"postman\\" goes outside and knocks on the door. Another person is chosen by the rest of the group to answer the door, and pays for the \\"letter\\" with a kiss. Then another person is chosen to be postman, etc. The game has many variations. In some versions, playing cards are used to select which people get to be postman and which get to be answerer in turn. * In the variation \\"Pony Express\\", the \\"Post Office\\" is a closet or it is in some other dark room. The game is played the same, but can become more intense. It is described in the 1954 movie Phffft as \\"...the same as Post Office, but with more 'horsing around'\\". * In Sweden, the game is referred to as ryska posten (\\"Russian mail/post office\\"). In popular culture * In Laura Ingalls Wilder's autobiography, Pioneer Girl, she lists games played at teenage parties, including \\"Post office\\" and \\"kissing games\\". * Published in 1929, Is Sex Necessary?, by James Thurber and E. B. White, refers repeatedly to Post Office, and to the possibly similar party game Pillow (for example, see p. 43 and pp. 49–50 of the 1964 Dell edition (copyright 1950)). * In the 1930 Charley Chase comedy short “Whispering Whoopee” Charley hires 3 wild women who play Post Office with some older gents to try and secure a real estate deal. * In the 1932 film The Purchase Price, a group of married adults in a farming community have a party (to welcome mail order brides) and play Post Office. One of the women goes into a separate bedroom and then comes out to the main room and announces that there are x letters and y postcards for [man's name]. The man and woman go into the bedroom, and exchange presumably kisses and hugs, then return to the main room to general hilarity. * In the 1932 film Huddle, a mixed group of college students in high spirits are talking on a train. One of the young men says, \\"Let's play Post Office.\\" One of the young women remarks, \\"That's a kids' game!\\" The young man then replies, \\"Not the way I play it!\\" The same gag (which may not have been original even then) is often used subsequently, for example in the 1934 Three Stooges short film Three Little Pigskins and in the 1941 Abbott and Costello film Hold That Ghost. The joke was a recurring one by Abbott and Costello. The joke has been used even in more recent times; in the 2013 film Gangster Squad, where Ryan Gosling's character uses it on Emma Stone's character. * In the 1936 Three Stooges short film A Pain in the Pullman, when the Stooges are being kicked out of the star's drawing room, Curly says \\"I thought she wanted to play Post Office!\\" * The game of \\"Post Office\\" is referenced in the 1936 film Postal Inspector. * In Wallace Stegner's first novel Remembering Laughter (1937), which is set on a farm in Iowa, the plot darkens after a party in which Post Office is played—the game is a prelude to emotional disaster. * In the 1938 film There’s Always a Woman, Joan Blondell's character attempts to impede a police search of her apartment. As one officer is searching a closet, she asks him what they are looking for and he tells her \\"A letter\\", to which she replies \\"Imagine a big man like you wanting to play Post Office!” * In the story \\"Three Hours Between Planes\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald (written in 1939 and published in 1941) Post Office is mentioned as a game that can cause terrible jealousy among children. * In the 1939 film Hell's Kitchen, after Buck Caesar (Stanley Fields) informs the \\"Dead End Kids\\" that every Saturday at the home-for-boys at which they live will now be treated as a \\"holiday,\\" with \\"some nice, clean, healthy sports,\\" one of the boys stands up and sarcastically says, to the great amusement of the other boys, \\"Now don't tell us you want us to play Post Office.\\" * In Osa Johnson's 1940 autobiography, I Married Adventure, she writes that her grandmother \\"was my self-constituted chaperone from the moment she had witnessed a game of kiss-the-pillow at one of my birthday parties...\\" (p. 71) * In the 1941 film Ridin' on a Rainbow, Gene Autry rescues a girl from the river. After returning her to her stateroom on the riverboat, a sailor who followed them in states \\"Let's get out of here before they start playing Post Office.\\" * Docks of New York, a 1945 East Side Kids film, Huntz Hall questions Leo Gorcey about what an older well-dressed man would've been doing prowling in the back alley carrying a large knife. Scratching his head while trying to unravel the mystery, Leo replies, \\"He wasn't playin' Post Office\\". * In a 1948 episode of Lucille Ball's radio show \\"My Favorite Husband,\\" characters play Post Office at a teenage dance. * In the 1950 short film So You Want to Throw a Party, Joe (George O'Hanlon) and Alice McDoakes are planning on throwing a party.

When Benny demands to know what Allen is doing in the closet, Allen says, \\"Playing 'Post Office.' Kiss me!\\" * In a 1954 episode of The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show in which Gracie Allen runs for city council, Gracie speaks to the chief of police. Near the end of the conversation he shakes her hand and says \\"It's been a real pleasure\\". Gracie replies, \\"If you think shaking hands is a pleasure, then you've never played Post Office.\\" * In the best-selling 1956 novel Peyton Place the 14th birthday party of the main character Allison McKenzie is celebrated with a \\"kissing game\\", as \\"Post Office\\". * In a 1957 episode of Leave it to Beaver \\"Party Invitation\\", Beaver goes to an all-girl party. One of the girls suggests playing Post Office. * In J. D. Salinger's Seymour: An Introduction (1959), Buddy describes himself and his brother as being \\"homely,\\" as children, and how they were \\"veteran recipients of bag after bag of unmailed letters\\", whenever the game was played at children's parties. * In his unfinished novel Answered Prayers, Truman Capote writes: \\"Kissing her, according to Dill, was like playing post office with a dead and rotting whale: she really did need a dentist.\\" * In a 1967 episode of the sitcom Bewitched entitled \\"I Get Your Nannie, You Get My Goat,\\" Darrin's boss, Larry Tate, disapproves of Darrin and Samantha's kissing in plain view on a patio at a business function for an important advertising client. Insinuating that it could be viewed as unprofessional and therefore embarrassing, Mr. Tate says, \\"Cut that out. What if somebody sees you?...The somebody I'm talking about, Darrin, is Roy Chappell of Chappell Baby Foods. I want to steer him out here so he can meet you and we can sew up the account. And I don't want him to catch you playing Post Office\\". * In the 1968 film Yours, Mine and Ours, Frank, played by Henry Fonda, is on a date with a younger free-love hippie.

In 1859 Pehimana and Aperahama Tama-i-parea sold the Waitotara Block to the government. As Maori-Pakeha conflict escalated in the 1860s, Pehimana and his father became Pai Marire adherents. Aperahama joined other chiefs at Weraroa pa on the Waitotara River, with whom he warned Lieutenant General Duncan Cameron to withdraw his troops south of the Kai Iwi Stream in February 1865. Cameron, however, took the villages of Perekama and Arei-ahi, and Pehimana and Aperahama duly submitted to the government.

The Seer was an official periodical of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) which first appeared in 1853 and was published throughout 1854.Neilson, Reid Larkin. Exhibiting Mormonism: The Latter-day Saints and the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011, p. 37, . History of publication After the LDS Church publicly acknowledged that it was teaching and practicing plural marriage at its September 1852 conference, LDS Church president Brigham Young dispatched apostle Orson Pratt to Washington, D.C., where he was asked to publish an apologetic magazine targeted at non-Mormons. The primary purpose of the magazine would be to explain and defend the principles of Mormonism. The first edition of The Seer was published in January 1853, with future editions being produced monthly. The contents of The Seer were composed almost entirely of original writings by Pratt. Throughout its publication history, the majority of Pratt's writing stressed the rationality of the doctrine of plural marriage.Bergera, Gary James. Conflict in the Quorum: Orson Pratt, Brigham Young, Joseph Smith. Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books, 2002, . For example, Pratt dedicated 107 of the 192 total pages of The Seer to a twelve- part exposition on what he called celestial marriage. The Seer was published in Washington, D.C. until July 1854, when publication was shifted to Liverpool, England. After only 18 issues, Pratt was forced to cease publication due to mounting financial losses. Circulation peaked at 400 copies in late 1853. \\"The world will not subscribe for nor read The Seer,\\"Letter from Orson Pratt to Parley P. Pratt (Feb. 12, 1854), quoted in Gary James Bergera, (2002) Conflict in the Quorum : Orson Pratt, Brigham Young, Joseph Smith, p. 111. Pratt lamented to his brother Parley. Resulting doctrinal controversy In 1865, a majority of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the LDS Church officially condemned some of Pratt's doctrinal declarations contained in The Seer: > \\"The Seer [and other writings by Pratt] contain doctrines which we cannot > sanction, and which we have felt impressed to disown, so that the Saints who > now live, and who may live hereafter, may not be misled by our silence, or > be left to misinterpret it. Where these objectionable works, or parts of > works, are bound in volumes, or otherwise, they should be cut out and > destroyed.\\"Deseret News, Aug. 23, 1865, 373; see also B.H. Roberts, Defense > of the Faith and the Saints, 2:294 (1912).

The key responsibilities of gold commissioners were to uphold the law, provide access to the gold fields, issue mining licences, and register gold claims. Such a role was required due to the lawlessness that often followed gold rushes. British Columbia In the Colony of British Columbia during the 1860s, Governor Douglas had three priorities to protect the two colonies he governed:The Colony of Vancouver Island and the Colony of British Columbia to protect the boundaries, to uphold law and order, and to provide access to the gold fields. In 1859, the Pig War together with McGowan's War the previous year, underlined concerns that American settlers might challenge the British jurisdictions. After the native population in the Washington Territory was devastated and the annexed land was opened to colonization, its colonist population grew rapidly to more than 11,000. General William Harney, after meeting with Douglas, reported to Washington that the population of the colony was largely American with few British and that it would soon be a commercial necessity for the colonists to yield Vancouver Island to the U.S. government. In these circumstances, Douglas enhanced the limited military capability of the Royal Engineers and developed the office of gold commissioner buttressed by the periodic visits of a traveling judge. The ten commissioners were appointed to specific geographic jurisdictions. Their primary role was to issue mining licences and register gold claims. The commissioners also acted as agents of everyday authority. They settled mining disputes, collected government revenues, oversaw land claims, served as electoral officers, and dealt with the natives. They displayed the British flag. They acted as a receiver-cashier for gold, which was held until the Gold Escort could deliver it to the capital. A gold commissioner's powers and duties also encompassed the duties of government agent, Indian agent, magistrate, mines commissioner, surveyor, sheriff, and coroner. The powers of a gold commissioner within his designated jurisdiction were second only to the governor. The position remained as a fixture in the new province when the colony joined Canada in 1871, although by the end of World War I nearly all gold commissioner positions had been devolved to separate offices, with the bulk of the office's power and legacy inherited by the government agent, who typically was also Indian agent as well as mines commissioner, which was a post associated with each of the mining districts. The office of chief gold commissioner continued, however, and still functions today as the administrator and chief regulatory authority for the Mineral Tenure Act, Coal Act and associated acts dealing with the holding and maintenance of mineral and coal tenure (claims and leases) within British Columbia. The current chief gold commissioner (2017) of British Columbia is Mark Messmer. Previous BC chief gold commissioners include May Mah-Paulson, Edmund J. Collazzi, Anne Currie, Gary Townsend, Laurel Nash, Jody Shimkus, Lisa Nye, William Phelan, Patrick O’Rourke, Gerald German, Denis Lieutard, John Clancy, M.R. Rutherford, E.J. Bowles, R.H. McCrimmon, K.B. Blakey, P.J. Mulcahy, Noel Wallinger, Robert J. Steenson, Peter O'Reilly, and Chartres Brew, the first to hold the office. References Other sources *McGowan's War, Donald J.

He was born in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, and died on the Isle of Man. A right-handed batsman, he scored 4 and 3 in his only first-class match against Oxford University and bowled 5 overs of slow left-arm spin for 28 without success. He played for Nottinghamshire Second XI from 1924 to 1931. His fame rests on his appearance as \\"13th man\\" for England on the final day of the 1930 Trent Bridge test against Australia. On the last day of the test match, Harold Larwood had been taken ill with gastritis so Copley was asked to field as a substitute. Without Larwood, the England attack was seriously weakened, enabling Don Bradman and Stan McCabe to quickly add 77 for the fourth wicket. McCabe struck a ball from Maurice Tate towards the long on boundary. Copley was fielding at deep mid on which is well short of the boundary. He had to dive full length to his right so he could catch the ball just before it made contact with the ground. He managed to hold it despite his momentum causing him to roll over. It is generally agreed that his catch was the turning point of the match, which England went on to win by 93 runs.Telegraph, 6 From 1939 to 1975, Copley was cricket coach and head groundsman at King William's College on the Isle of Man.Wisden 1987, p. 1229.

Hockey career Strachan was owner and president of the Montreal Wanderers from 1904 to 1909 during which the Wanderers won 3 of their 4 Stanley Cups in 1906, 1907 and 1908. In 1908–09, he also served as their head coach. He sold the club to P. J. Doran in 1909. The sale eventually triggered the formation of the National Hockey Association (NHA) when Doran moved the Wanderers to the Jubilee Rink. The Rink was smaller than the Wanderers' previous rink, the Montreal Arena, and the other Eastern Canada Hockey League members formed a new ice hockey league to remove the Wanderers. The Wanderers then formed their own league (the NHA) in partnership with Ambrose O'Brien. The ECHA's new league failed and some of the teams joined the NHA. Strachan later served as first president of the Montreal Maroons ice hockey club. Strachan intended for the Maroons to be a revival of the Wanderers but he could not secure clear title to the name. The original Wanderers had folded in 1918 after a fire at the Montreal Arena. Lacking a name, the club was dubbed the 'Maroons' after the colour of their jerseys. In their second season the Maroons won the Stanley Cup championship in 1926. Strachan served as Maroons' president from their founding in 1924 until June 1934, when he resigned to take care of his businesses. James Strachan's younger brothers Billy and Bert Strachan were both ice hockey players with the Montreal Victorias and the Montreal Wanderers.

Jonas was born in Warsaw, Poland, debuting her pianistic talent at the age of 9. In spite of Jonas's father's misgivings about a career in piano performance, Jonas studied with the Polish pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski, as a fellow pupil of Witold Małcużyński and Halina Czerny-Stefańska, and made her debut with the Warsaw Philharmonic in 1920. Jonas's adult career started in 1926 with a tour of various European capitals starting in Germany. Her touring career proved successful and paved the way for a 13th-place finish in the second International Chopin Piano Competition in 1932. Alexander Uninsky took first prize in the same competition. In 1933 Jonas won the Beethoven prize of Vienna and following her victory established a successful European-based performance career. Jonas's success in establishing herself as a European touring pianist was overshadowed in 1939 by the German invasion of Poland. She refused the invitation of a Gestapo agent to move to Berlin and perform in a safer environment. As a result, Jonas was arrested and remained in custody for several weeks. A German officer who had once heard her perform in Germany took pity on her and had her released. The German officer advised Jonas to travel to Berlin and visit the Brazilian Embassy for aid. Jonas took the German officer's advice and traveled to Berlin on foot, walking several hundred miles short of food and without recourse to safe shelter. The distant walk to Berlin is likely to have seriously damaged Jonas's health and may have resulted in her untimely death at the age of 48. The embassy supplied Jonas with false records that made her out to be the wife of the Ambassador's son. Jonas traveled from Berlin to Lisbon and finally settled in the capital of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro. In the year 1940, while residing in Brazil, Jonas suffered a nervous breakdown and lived several months in sanatoria. When it looked as though she was on the mend, she received the painful news that one of her brothers had been killed; this was followed by news that her husband and parents had also died. These painful losses made the prospects of her future as a pianist appear unlikely. Jonas's sister and Arthur Rubinstein, another famous Polish pianist, offered their support to Jonas and opened the possibility for her to return to performing and recording piano music. She resumed her pianistic career in New York City, making her debut at Carnegie Hall in February, 1946.

It was called by Pope Eugene IV on 1 January 1443 and led by King Władysław III of Poland, John Hunyadi, Voivode of Transylvania, and Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy. The Crusade of Varna culminated in a decisive Ottoman victory over the crusader alliance at the Battle of Varna on 10 November 1444, during which Władysław and the expedition's Papal legate Julian Cesarini were killed. Background In 1428, while the Ottoman Empire was fighting a war with the Republic of Venice and the Kingdom of Hungary they achieved a temporary peace by establishing the Serbian Despotate as a buffer state. After the war ended in 1430, the Ottomans returned to their earlier objective of controlling all lands south of the Danube. In 1432, Sultan Murad II began raiding into Transylvania. After King Sigismund died in 1437, the attacks intensified, with the Ottomans occupying Borač in 1438 and Zvornik and Srebrenica in 1439. At the end of 1439, Smederevo capitulated and Murad succeeded in making Serbia an Ottoman province. Đurađ Branković, Despot of Serbia, fled to his estates in Hungary. In 1440, Murad besieged Hungary's main border fortress, Belgrade. After failing to take the fortress, he was forced to return to Anatolia to stop attacks by the Karamanids. Meanwhile, Sigismund's successor Albert had died in October 1439, shortly after signing a law to \\"restore the ancient laws and customs of the realm\\". The law restricted the royal authority by requiring the participation of landed nobility in political decisions. Four months after Albert's death, his only son, Ladislaus, was born while Hungary was in the midst of a civil war over the next monarch. On 17 July 1440 Vladislaus, king of Poland, was crowned despite continuing disputes. John Hunyadi aided Vladislaus's cause by pacifying the eastern counties, gaining him the position of Nádor of Transylvania and the corresponding responsibility of protecting Hungary's southern border. By the end of 1442, Vladislaus had secured his status in Hungary, and rejected an Ottoman proposal of peace in exchange for Belgrade. The Roman Catholic Church had long been advocating for a crusade against the Ottomans, and with the end of both the Hungarian civil war and a nearly simultaneous one in Byzantium, they were able to begin negotiations and planning realistically. The impetus required to turn the plans into action was provided by Hunyadi between 1441-42\\\\. In 1441, he defeated a raid led by Ishak Pasha of Smederevo. He nearly annihilated Mezid Bey's army in Transylvania on 22 March 1442, and in September he defeated the revenge attack of Şihabeddin Pasha, governor-general of Rumelia. Branković, hoping to liberate Serbia, also lent his support after Novo Brdo, the last major Serbian city, fell to the Ottomans in 1441. The Crusade =Early fighting= On 1 January 1443 Pope Eugene IV published a crusading bull. In early May, it was reported \\"that the Turks were in a bad state and that it would be easy to expel them from Europe\\". War was proclaimed against Sultan Murad II at the diet of Buda on Palm Sunday 1443, and with an army of 40,000 men, mostly Magyars, the young monarch, with Hunyadi commanding under him, crossed the Danube and took Nish and Sofia. The crusaders, led by Vladislaus, Hunyadi, and Branković, attacked in mid-October. They correctly expected that Murad would not be able quickly to mobilize his army, which consisted mainly of fief-holding cavalrymen (timariots) who needed to collect the harvest to pay taxes. Hunyadi's experience of winter campaigns from 1441-42 added to the Hungarians' advantage. They also had better armor, often rendering the Ottoman weapons useless. Murad could not rely on the loyalty of his troops from Rumelia, and had difficulties countering Hungarian tactics. = Battle of Nish = In the Battle of Nish the crusaders were victorious and forced Kasim Pasha of Rumelia and his co-commander Turahan Bey to flee to Sofia, Bulgaria to warn Murad of the invasion. However, the two burned all the villages in their path in an attempt to wear down the crusaders with a scorched earth tactic. When they arrived in Sofia, they advised the Sultan to burn the city and retreat to the mountain passes beyond, where the Ottoman's smaller army would not be such a disadvantage. = Battle of Zlatitsa = Shortly after, bitter cold set in, and the next encounter, fought at Zlatitsa Pass on 12 December 1443, was fought in the snow. Until the Battle of Zlatitsa the crusaders did not meet a major Ottoman army, but only town garrisons along their route toward Adrianople. Finally, at Zlatitsa they met strong and well positioned defence forces of the Ottoman army. The crusaders were defeated. As they marched home, however, they ambushed and defeated a pursuing force in the Battle of Kunovica, where Mahmud Bey, son-in-law of the Sultan and brother of the Grand Vizier Çandarlı Halil Pasha, was taken prisoner. Four days after this battle the Christian coalition reached Prokuplje. Đurađ Branković proposed to Władysław III of Poland and John Hunyadi that they stay in Serbian fortified towns during the winter and continue their campaign against the Ottomans in Spring 1444. They rejected his proposal, and retreated. By the end of January 1444 forces of Władysław and Hunyadi reached Belgrade, and in February they arrived at Buda where they were greeted as heroes. While the battle at Zlatitsa Pass had been a defeat, the ambush returned to the crusaders the impression of an overall Christian victory, and they returned triumphant. The King and Church were both anxious to maintain this impression, and gave instructions to spread word of the victories, but contradict anyone who mentioned the loss. Murad, meanwhile, returned angry and dejected by the unreliability of his forces, and imprisoned Turahan after blaming him for the army's setbacks and Mahmud Bey's capture. =Peace proposals= Władysław Warneńczyk; and Janos Hunyadi Murad is believed to have had the greatest wish for peace. Among other things, his sister begged him to obtain her husband Mahmud's release, and his wife Mara, daughter of Đurađ Branković, added additional pressure. On 6 March 1444 Mara sent an envoy to Branković; their discussion started the peace negotiations with the Ottoman Empire. On 24 April 1444 Vladislaus sent a letter to Murad, stating that his ambassador, Stojka Gisdanić, was travelling to Edirne with full powers to negotiate on his behalf. He asked that, once an agreement was reached, Murad sent his own ambassadors with the treaty and his sworn oath to Hungary, at which point Vladislaus could also swear. That same day, Vladislaus held a Diet at Buda, where he swore before Cardinal Julian Cesarini to lead a new expedition against the Ottomans in the summer. The strongest remaining supporter of Ladislaus' claim for the throne also agreed to a truce, thus removing the danger of another civil war. Between June and August 1444, negotiations for a treaty were carried out, first in Edirne, and then in Szeged. The crusaders were not entirely interested in peace, however, especially with Cesarini pushing for the crusade's continuation. The Cardinal eventually found a solution that would allow for both the continuation of fighting and the ratification of the treaty, and on 15 August 1444 the Peace of Szeged was sworn into effect. =Final stage= Shortly after all the short-term requirements of the treaty were fulfilled, the Hungarians and their allies resumed the crusade. Murad, who had retired shortly after the treaty was completed, was called back to lead the Ottoman army. On 10 November 1444 the two armies clashed at the Battle of Varna (near the Black Sea fortress of Varna, Bulgaria). The Ottomans won a decisive victory despite heavy losses, while the crusaders lost their king and over 15,000 men.Ervin Liptai, Magyarország hadtörténete, Csaba Csorba-János Estók-Konrád Salamon, Magyarország képes története, Aftermath Many of the Crusaders were crippled by frostbite, many more died in smaller follow-up battles, and many Europeans were captured. Hungary fell back into civil war until Hunyadi was elected Regent for the infant Ladislaus in June 1446. Branković retained control over Serbia. The Ottoman victory in Varna, followed by their victory in the Second Battle of Kosovo in 1448, deterred the European states from sending substantial military assistance to the Byzantines during the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453. Although Pius II officially declared a three-year crusade at the Council of Mantua to recapture Constantinople from the Ottomans, the leaders who promised 80,000 soldiers to it reneged on their commitment. The Ottoman Empire was free, for several decades, from any further serious attempts to push it out of Europe. In Popular Culture The end of the Crusade of Varna serves as the starting point for the grand strategy video game Europa Universalis IV by Paradox Development Studio, one day after the Battle of Varna, on 11 November 1444.

History Seventh Wonder was formed in 2000 by bass player Andreas Blomqvist, guitarist Johan Liefvendahl and drummer Johnny Sandin after their previous band fell apart. Their music started to develop in the direction of progressive metal and as the band was joined by keyboard player Andreas Kyrt Söderin late 2000, the new sound was cemented further. Two demos were recorded, the first in 2001 (Seventh Wonder) and the second in 2003 (Temple In The Storm). Many singers have come and gone in Seventh Wonder over the years, among others Ola Halén of power metal band Insania Sthlm. The longest lasting member in the past was Andi Kravljaca (ex: Heave, Elsesphere, now Silent Call), and it was with Kravljaca at the microphone that the band recorded their debut album Become (released in 2005), after landing a record deal with Finland's Lion Music. Prior to the release of Become in 2005, Tommy Karevik joined the band. Become was well received by the press and top scores were given everywhere. However, the band and Andi decided to part ways shortly after the recording process had ended and once more the search for a singer started. The next album, entitled Waiting in the Wings, was recorded in 2006 and was mixed and mastered by Tommy Hansen. Waiting in the Wings got even better reviews than Become did, scoring multiple top scores of 10 out of 10. 2007 was a year of writing new material and playing live. During 2007 Seventh Wonder played in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, England and the Netherlands together with acts such as Jorn Lande, Pagan's Mind, Queensryche, Testament, Sun Caged and Redemption. In August 2007 the band parted ways with Intromental Management, but continued to work with Lion Music. Seventh Wonder released their next album, Mercy Falls, on September 12, 2008. It is a concept album about a man who drops into a coma after a car crash and dreams of a place called Mercy Falls, while his family tries in vain to wake him from his sleep. In December 2009, they began writing material for The Great Escape. They entered the studio in April 2010, and posted regular updates on their official forum and YouTube channel. The album The Great Escape was released on December 3, 2010, and was very well received by fans and critics. Before the release of the album, drummer Johnny Sandin quit the band for private reasons. On April 25, 2011, Seventh wonder announced that Stefan Norgren had replaced Sandin as the band's drummer. In June 2012, Tommy Karevik was announced as Kamelot's new singer, but stated that he has no intention of leaving Seventh Wonder. On September 7, 2013, the band announced they would be recording a live DVD at 2014 ProgPower USA Festival, performing songs from their album Mercy Falls in its entirety for the first and final time. In 2016, the band signed with Italian record company Frontiers Records to release the live CD/DVD called Welcome To Atlanta Live 2014 on September 23, 2016 and also a new studio album that is expected to be released in 2018. On 28 October 2017, the band announced through their Facebook that the album would be titled Tiara.. The album was released on October 12, 2018.

His name was engraved on the Stanley Cup in 1944 with the Montreal Canadiens. Leonard Arthur Peto was born in London, England, June 25, 1892, and died in Vallejo, Solano County, California, November 10, 1985. He came to Canada in 1912 and joined the staff of the Canadian Car and Foundry Company eventually rising to the position of vice president and managing director. At about the same time he joined the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association (MAAA). During his soccer career in Canada he played in goal for the MAAA and was also a member of the Montreal All-Star team that played in the Carls-Rite Cup game against the Toronto All-Stars in 1915. When a knee injury took him out of competition he turned to organizing and became the man behind Montreal Carsteel, one of the greatest teams in Canadian soccer history. During the turbulent years of the 1920s he was also involved with the Inter-Provincial League and then became the first president of the National Soccer League when it was formed in 1926, a position he held for 10 years. He was also behind an ill-fated attempt to form an International League between teams in the National Soccer League and the American Soccer League in 1926, the league lasted just one season. He also found himself in trouble with the Dominion of Canada Football Association (today's Canadian Soccer Association) over an attempt to play Sunday soccer in Montreal when soccer on the Sabbath was frowned on in Canada. However, as time went on he returned to favour and was elected President of the Dominion of Canada Football Association in 1935, a position he held until 1939. In later years he switched his interest to Canadian football and then to hockey. In 1940, along with D.C. Coleman, he was invited by Senator Donat Raymond to join the board of directors of the Canadian Arena Company, and this led to him becoming one of a three-man committee directing operations of the NHL Canadiens when the club was taken over by Forum interests from private ownership. For some years previous he had been honorary president of the Montreal Royals of the Quebec Senior Hockey League. He later moved to Philadelphia, where in 1945 he sought to revive the dormant Maroons franchise. The team had suspended operations in 1938, and World War II had prevented their return. While Peto got swift approval to move the Maroons to Philadelphia, he was stymied by the lack of an arena that was suitable even for temporary use. After two years of attempts to find an adequate arena or build a new one, he returned the Maroons franchise to the league. His soccer team Montreal Carsteel dominated soccer in Quebec, winning the Quebec Cup, the championship of Quebec in 1925, 1927, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1937, 1938 and 1939. Carsteel also reached the final of the Canadian Challenge Cup in 1939, only to lose to Vancouver Radials in four close games. He was a member of the Mount Stephen club in Montreal, the Kanawaki Golf Club and the St. George Snowshoe Club, and a Life Member of the Province of Quebec Football Association and of the Dominion of Canada Football Association. In 2011, he was inducted into the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame as a pioneer.http://www.thesoccerhalloffame.ca/virtual-hall-of-fame/pioneers/len- peto References *Dictionary of Canadian Biography *Len Peto, Big Booster for Soccer Made Switch to Football Hockey, Montreal Star, December 12, 1959 *Len Peto Elevated New Dominion Prexy, Toronto Telegram, September 19, 1935 *Len Peto Chosen As Dominion President, Hamilton Spectator, September 21, 1935 *Len Peto of Montreal is New Dominion Prexy, Toronto Star, September 21, 1935 *L.A.

Not all masses based on freely composed material were so named, but many were, particularly from the late 15th century through the 16th century. One of the earliest examples of a Missa sine nomine is by Guillaume Dufay, (Bologna, International museum and library of music, Ms Q15) whose Missa Resvelliés vous (formerly known as a Missa sine nomine) dates from before 1430, and possibly as early as 1420.Cross, MQ It may have been written for the wedding of Carlo Malatesta and Vittoria di Lorenzo in Rimini.Planchart, quoted in program notes to Da Camera Many other composers wrote Missae sine nomine, including Walter Frye, Barbingant, Alexander Agricola, Johannes Tinctoris, Matthaeus Pipelare, Heinrich Isaac, Pierre de La Rue, Josquin des Prez, Jean Mouton, Vincenzo Ruffo, and others. Some masses sine nomine, i.e. based on freely-composed material, were actually named in other ways: the most famous is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina's Missa Papae Marcelli, the Pope Marcellus Mass, which according to a somewhat exaggerated legend persuaded the Council of Trent not to ban polyphonic writing in liturgical music. Also many canonic masses are literally sine nomine: the Missa prolationum of Johannes Ockeghem and the Missa ad fugam of Josquin des Prez are of this type, as is the late Missa sine nomine by Josquin, in which he returns with new insight to compositional problems he first tackled in his early Missa Ad fugam.Lockwood/Kirkman, Grove onlineBloxham, in Scherr, p. 204-209 A myth dating from the time of the Council of Trent was that a Missa sine nomine hid a secular tune, and the listeners were expected to \\"get the joke\\"; however the practice of writing masses on freely-composed material predated the Council of Trent and the Counter-Reformation.

Measuring about 3,180 square kilometers, it is one of the largest protected lowland forest system in Central America, the second largest lowland rainforest reserve in Nicaragua (after Bosawás) and is a key component in the proposed Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. It has previously been referred to as \\"the gem of Central American nature reserves\\" by UCLA biologists.ToursNicaragua.com Nicaragua Nature Reserves, Parks and Wildlife Refuges Indio Maíz is rich in biodiversity, holding a higher number in species of trees, birds, and insects than all of Europe.Guardian.co.uk - Travel: River of dreams In recent years, a growing timber and oil palm industry has led to increasing rates of deforestation along the northern and western flanks of Indio Maíz. Overview Yellow- banded poison dart frog The Indio Maíz Biological Reserve is a remnant of the \\"Áreas Naturales Protegidas del Sureste de Nicaragua\\" established in 1990 during the first Sandinista government. The region was reorganised as the \\"Reserva de Biosfera del Sureste de Nicaragua\\" in 1999 and was split up into four smaller protected areas, after the Bosawás Biosphere Reserve had been reorganised in 1997. Seventy percent of the reserve is also part of the territory administered by the autonomous Rama-Kriol Territorial Government and is home to indigenous Rama and Kriol people. They gained the right to govern these territories by the revolutionary government in 1987, and in response to international pressure now hold deed to the land since after 2002. This presents an unforeseen legal regime for the reserve which must yet be solved. Most of the Biological Reserve is out of bounds to tourists and no hiking is permitted, only boat tours with guides at starting two locations: the Bartola River at the western border near the village of El Castillo, and Greytown.Nicaragua.com National Parks - Indio Maíz Biological Reserve At the Bartola river entrance there is a small station with guards from the Ministry of Natural Resources (MARENA), which can be hired as guides. Native American Rama people also can be hired as guides. It is possible to stay in old abandoned wooden Rama huts along the Indian River upstream from Greytown. The climate of the reserve is classified as humid tropical rainforest (Af) in the Köppen climate classification with a mean annual temperature around 26 °C. It receives upwards of 4,000 mm of rain annually with a long wet season lasting from May to January, followed by a shorter slightly \\"drier\\" season from February to April. The soils are nutrient-poor ultisols with poor drainage. Fauna Indio-Maiz boasts a large number in species of both flora and fauna. It is home to 65 species of mammals including 4 species of wild cats, 221 species of birds, 55 species of reptiles, 34 species of amphibians and 149 recorded insect species. Great green macaws, Baird's tapirs (Tapirus bairdii) and jaguars (Panthera onca) have important population strongholds in the reserve. Some of the mammals present include pumas, jaguars, armadillos, fishing bulldog bat, sloths, raccoons, wild boar and tame manatees. Also present are several different species of monkey, most notably the white-headed capuchin, along with howler and spider monkeys. Other rare species of bird include scarlet macaws, harpy eagle, three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculatus) and great curassow (Crax rubra). Other birds are the royal flycatcher. Reptiles including crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus), turtles, iguanas, and snakes such as the bushmaster Lachesis muta and Bothriechis schlegelii. Among the amphibian family, there are brightly colored poison dart frogs like Oophaga pumilioNature.com The Nature Conservancy in Nicaragua and as of 2014 it is one of only three places in Nicaragua where the toad Incilius melanochlorus has been recorded. Fish like tarpon are common. The world's only freshwater shark, Nicaragua shark, known elsewhere in the world as the bull shark or Zambesi shark is also present in the San Juan River which borders the reserve. Nicaragua has recently banned freshwater shark fishing because of population declines.UnderwaterTime.com Nicaragua bans freshwater shark fishing amid dwindling population numbers  Flora  Floristically, Indio Maíz is comparable to that of other Caribbean lowland forests found on the eastern- facing slopes of Costa Rica including the adjacent Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge and Tortuguero National Park, located immediately south of the reserve. Some of the woody species found include: Astronium graveolens, Carpotroche platyptera, Clavija jelskii, Luehea seemanii, Mansoa hymenaea, Posoqueria latifolia, and Sorocea affinis. The palms Bactris hondurensis, Cryosophila warscewiczii, and Desmoncus sp. are found within the reserve. Bactris hondurensis found growing in the understory. Several species of herbaceous plants can be found in the understory, including the common Heliconia latispatha. One of the largest species of Neotropical Araceae, Dracontium gigas, can also be found here. Like other tropical lowland forests throughout Central America, epiphytic plants are also found in abundance. There is also a diverse array of ferns and lycopods present, such as Selaginella eurynota. Threats The reserve is threatened by encroaching agricultural development as land is being developed into oil palm and cattle pasture by settlers from the east. In the mid-1990s villages developed in the interior of the reserve, these were evicted in 2001, but since 2010 deforestation has returned. As of 2015 some 600 families are believed to inhabit the centre of the reserve. A number of groups have organised together as the \\" Unión de Organizaciones Ambientalistas\\" (UOA) in 2015 to coordinate a response, including the indigenous territorial government, Fundación del Río, two local cocoa-farming cooperatives, a tourism cooperative and the municipal network for water and sanitation. They would like the government to send in the army and police. In 2018 this group formed the \\"Batallón Cívico Indio-Maíz\\". Hurricane Otto of November 2016, which crossed Central America into the Pacific directly through the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border region, has had a large effect on the woodlands and communities of the region. In early April 2018, forest fires burned 13,500 acres (5,500 hectares) of the Indio Maiz Biological Reserve. Dead wood left in the forests after the hurricane in 2016 may have fuelled the fires. Environmental and indigenous rights activists protested what they saw as an inadequate government response on the part of the Ortega-Murillo administration. Counterprotests supported the Sandinista Front government.

It is part of the pharmacology of the traditional Ayurvedic and Unani systems of medicine of the Indian subcontinent. It is also an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines. Purported benefits Tabasheer is claimed to provide a variety of health benefits. It is variously regarded as an antipyretic, antispasmodic, antiparalytic, restorative and aphrodisiac. Varieties Tabasheer that has a blueish tint (usually called neel or neelkanth) is considered superior to tabasheer that has the \\"more plain\\" yellow or white color. Extraction Not all bamboo stems contain tabasheer. Likely candidates are found by shaking bamboo stems, which can make the mineralized tabasheer inside produce a rattling sound. These stems are split open to extract the tabasheer. History Although a part of the ancient Ayurvedic system of medicine, it has been postulated that the use of tabasheer originated in the Adivasi aboriginal tribes of India. Tabasheer was extensively exported from India for thousands of years, including through Arab traders during the medieval period. The town of Thane, close to the west coast of India, was famous as a clearing center for tabasheer in the twelfth century CE. It was called σάκχαρον in the writings of Pedanius Dioscorides, a Greek pharmacologist who practiced in Rome in the time of Nero. Etymology and alternative names Tabasheer is referred to as Tvaksheera (त्वक्षीर) in Sanskrit, which means bark milk. Other Sanskrit-derived names have been applied to tabasheer as well, including bamboo sugar (vans-sharkar), bamboo camphor (vans karpoor) and bamboo manna.

In all, the side played 30 first-class matches, winning only five and losing nine. The batting was led by George Headley, who scored almost twice as many runs as the next highest aggregate and averaged 66 runs per innings (the next best was 39). The bowling was spearheaded by the pace of Manny Martindale, from Barbados, who took 14 wickets in the Tests and 103 on the tour. He cut Wally Hammond's chin open at Old Trafford and, in partnership with Learie Constantine in this match, used the same bodyline tactics England had used the previous winter against Australia. Wisden in 1934 had George Headley as its Cricketer of the Year alongside English players Cyril Walters, Fred Bakewell, Les Townsend and Morris Nichols (see Wisden in Cricinfo). The touring team The team was captained by the former Cambridge University blue Jackie Grant, who had been captain on the tour of Australia in 1930-31. The full team was: * Jackie Grant, captain (T&T;) * Teddy Hoad, vice-captain (Barbados) * Ellis Achong (T&T;) * Ivan Barrow, wicket-keeper (Jamaica) * Cyril Christiani, wicket- keeper (Guyana) * Oscar Da Costa (Jamaica) * Herman Griffith (Barbados) * George Headley (Jamaica) * Freddie Martin (Jamaica) * Manny Martindale (Barbados) * Cyril Merry (T&T;) * Clifford Roach (T&T;) * Ben Sealey (T&T;) * Vincent Valentine (Jamaica) * Archie Wiles (T&T;) In addition to the regular touring party, Learie Constantine, then of T&T; but playing Lancashire League cricket in England and not available for the full tour, played in one Test and four other first-class matches, and George Francis of Barbados, also engaged in League cricket, played in the first Test at Lord's, but was not called on for any other first-class matches. Rolph Grant of T&T;, brother of the captain and an undergraduate at Cambridge University, played in the match against the university and Clifford Inniss of Barbados, an undergraduate at Oxford, played in the match against Oxford University and in one other first-class match against MCC. Constantine, Francis, Griffith, Hoad, Martin and Roach had been members of the 1928 West Indies side which toured England and were the first to play Test cricket. All six of them played in Tests on that tour. Achong, Barrow, Da Costa and Headley had made their Test debuts in the 1929-30 season against the England team. Jackie Grant's first Test appearances were on the 1930-31 tour of Australia. Christiani, Martindale, Merry, Sealey and Wiles had not played Test cricket before this tour and all of them except Christiani played Tests in the 1933 series. Christiani made his Test debut in the 1934-35 series against England, as did Rolph Grant. The other co-opted player on this tour, Clifford Inniss, never played Test cricket. The manager of the team was John Kidney, who played 11 first-class matches for Barbados between 1909 and 1932. He later managed the 1939 touring team in England. The Test matches Three Test matches, each of three days' duration, were played. =First Test, at Lord's, 24, 26, 27 June= West Indies lost six first-innings wickets for 55 before the end of the second day, and the other four in 65 minutes on the final morning. Walter Robins took six wickets for 32 runs. Following on 199 behind, West Indies did better, with Headley making 50 out of 64 and Hoad and Grant adding 52 for the fourth wicket. But George Macaulay and Hedley Verity each took four wickets and the match was won in mid-afternoon. =Second Test, at Manchester, 22, 24, 25 July= Barrow and Headley made the first centuries for West Indies in Tests in England and put on 200 for the second wicket before Barrow was out for 105. Headley went on to an unbeaten 169 but of the other batsmen only Constantine, released from his club contract for this match, made much impact, his 31 coming out of 36. Martindale and Constantine used the bodyline \\"leg-theory\\" style of bowling fast and short to a packed leg-side field, and England lost four wickets for 134, including Hammond, who returned to bat after having his chin split open by a short-pitched ball. Douglas Jardine led the resistance, putting on 83 with Ames and 140 with Robins. Jardine's 127 was his first Test match century. Martindale took five wickets for 73 runs. When West Indies batted a second time, England fast bowler Edward Clark also bowled leg-theory, but with little success. James Langridge, in his first Test, took seven wickets for 56, but Roach made 64 and Constantine the same number, and the match was left drawn when the West Indies second innings ended. =Third Test, at The Oval, 12, 14, 15 August= An experimental England side under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt was reliant on 107 from Fred Bakewell, made out of 194. Charlie Barnett, with 52 in his first Test, then put on 95 in 85 minutes for the eighth wicket with Stan Nichols, who made 49. When West Indies batted, only debutant Sealey, with 29, made much of the bowling of Clark, Nichols and another player new to Test cricket, Charles Marriott. Marriott followed his five for 37 with six for 59 in the second innings, giving match figures of 11 for 96. Roach made 56 and Da Costa 35, but the match was over early on the third day. Other first-class matches Wisden in 1934 says the team played in 30 first-class matches, including the three test matches against England, and of these they won five, drew 16 and lost nine. Outside the first-class fixtures they engaged in eight of lesser importance, being successful in three of these and drawing the other five. For source, see Wisden 1934 in Cricinfo. Source *S. J.

Biography O'Reilly was criticized in his time and by latter-day academics for largely shirking his duties and avoiding meetings with First Nations leaders, but the basis of the Indian Reserve system as it remains in British Columbia today is the outcome of his assignment, known informally as the O'Reilly Commission. O'Reilly was also the second Gold Commissioner of the Rock Creek Mining District, replacing W.G. Cox at the time of the Governor's visit during the Rock Creek War. Point Ellice House O'Reilly's residence in Victoria, Point Ellice House, is preserved today as a house museum and gardens. Positioned overlooking Selkirk Water and the Gorge Waterway, Point Ellice House was constructed between 1861 and 1862 for Catherine and Charles Wentworth Wallace. Architects John Wright & George Sanders chose an Italianate Villa-style design that was popular during the nineteenth century. The Canadian Register of Historic Places lists the character-defining elements of the house as: * The house’s location next to the Gorge Waterway, with access to the place from both land and water * The design of the house as a single storey (plus attic) rambling Victorian Italianate villa with all of its details, such as the shallow-pitched gabled roofs, wide overhanging bracketed eaves, verandahs and porches, medieval style chimneys, tall spacious windows and classical detailing * The asymmetrical floor plan and spatial configuration of the interior, with its narrow halls and enclosed rooms, and the physical integrity of its finishes, such as floors, wall coverings, ceilings, doors, moldings and architectural hardware * All of the mature historic garden and landscaping features, which include the croquet/tennis lawns, pathways, rose bushes, flower beds, mature trees and shrubs, and the sequoia tree planted by Peter O’Reilly * The unobstructed views and relationship between house and garden * The existing form and materials of the carriage shed. Point Ellice House was designated a National Historic Site in 1966 and became a Provincial Historic Site in 1975. The house is also listed on the City of Victoria’s heritage registry. It is located right next to the site of the Point Ellice Bridge Disaster.

His reign is obscure and the next judge mentioned is his son Constantine I in 1112, but to ascribe to Marianus a 39-year reign seems unnecessary and the presence of unknown other judges between Marianus and Constantine is likely. In 1147, Marianus' grandson, Gonario II, made a donation of silver to the Abbey of Montecassino, citing his father and his grandfather as prior donors. Perhaps this Marianus was a different one from the one who received a letter from Pope Gregory VII in 1073. Similarly, the Cronaca sarda makes Marianus the son of Andrew Tanca. The exact identity and relationships of this judge remain a matter of dispute. Not only did Marianus make a donation to Montecassino, but he benefited the local churches as well and paid an annual sum to the papacy. He was an ally of the Republic of Pisa.

In late July 1902, plans were prepared for the building, which was to be constructed on one-half acre of land promised by Edward Jones. However, Jones had sold his land to Halvor Nelson, who then added another one-half acre to the property. Construction of the Carpenter Gothic building began in 1905 and was completed, inside and out, in 1908. Although the interior of the building had not yet been completed, the first service in the church took place on December 26, 1905, when Halvor Lien married Hilda Slind. The pews, altar railing, and pulpit were carved by Eric Leien, a member of the congregation. It was originally named the Evangelical Lutheran Church, Bethany Congregation of Kendrick. There is no longer an active congregation holding services, but the church and cemetery are maintained by community members.

He was born in Ireland. Cox was among the war party raised in the Cariboo during the Chilcotin War, riding west from Alexandria, British Columbia with 50 men raised in the goldfields to meet the corresponding party of the New Westminster Rifle Corps, mostly former Royal Engineers, led by Governor Seymour and Chief Constable Brew, who had disembarked from at Bella Coola and entered the Chilcotin District from the west. Cox, who is described by BC historians G.P.V. and Helen B. Akrigg as \\"friendly, genial and easy-going\\", encamped at Puntzi Lake on June 12, 1864, four days after leaving Alexandria, and did not very much in advance of the arrival of Seymour's and Brew's contingent other than build minor fortifications. The leader of the Tsilhqot'in revolt, Klatassine or Klatsassan, was actually in the vicinity of Puntzi Lake when Cox arrived, but slipped away from the area. Rather than attempt pursuit Cox whiled away a month at Puntzi Lake, using up expensive supplies and much to the later chagrin of his seniors in government, sent for more. Cox rationalized that he had been at the site waiting for Chief Alexis, to whom he had sent a message and for whom he had sent out a party to seek him at Chilcotin Forks, and that without this powerful Tsilhqot'in chief on-side there was little he could do but wait for the Governor's party. As the Akriggs comment, \\"One can imagine the blistering contempt Sir James Douglas would have expressed if Cox had given such a report to him\\" (had Douglas still been Governor). Governor Seymour, nonplussed by Cox's excuse, sent him and his troops to Tatla Lake to search for the warring members of the Tsilhqot'in. Cox's party was joined soon after by former Fort Kamloops Chief Trader, Donald McLean, but McLean was frustrated by Cox's incompetence and set out on his own foray near the northern end of Chilko Lake where he was surprised from behind by Klatassine, who fired a shot into McLean's back, which was unprotected by the iron skillet he customarily wore under the front of his shirt, killing him. Cox was discouraged at the death of McLean, who was a noted and self-touted \\"Indian killer\\", and wanted to abandon the pursuit but Governor Seymour insisted he persevere in the hunt, partly because given the expense of the expedition he had to have something to account for upon his return to the capital. As luck would have it, the rebel Tshilqot'in warriors walked into Cox's camp, which by then was on the site of the former Fort Chilcotin, a long-defunct Hudson's Bay Company fur-post, apparently in response to a message from Cox which seemed to promise them \\"amnesty in time of war\\". The Governor and his officials, however, had made no such promise and Klatassine and his men were arrested and eventually tried and hanged for murder at Qiesnellemouthe (today's Quesnel). In 1867, Cox was among those who pushed for the selection of Victoria as the capital of the newly united colonies, partly by opposing a dredging plan for New Westminster, whose faults as prospective capital included the difficulty of navigating the sandbars and shoals of the lowermost Fraser. In 1868, Cox was among those who opposed an address to the Queen prepared by John Robson, Amor de Cosmos, Edward Stamp and G.A.B. Walkem and mandated by mass meetings in New Westminster and at Yale (known as the Yale Convention) in regards to joining Canada, as they opposed the terms proposed. Others opposing were Henry Pering Pellew Crease, Joseph Trutch, Joseph Despard Pemberton, John Sebastian Helmcken, Thomas Elwyn, Henry Maynard Ball and Messrs Wood, Ker, Smith, and Spalding.

groups form Colonies, which in turn become Chapters by earning a Phi Sigma Kappa Charter from the International Headquarters. A charter is a document which conveys from a governing body permission for a local group to operate as a chapter. A PSK Charter also signifies the date and location of the new chapter, and lists its founding members. In the event of a re-colonization, a new group may still refer to the original charter date when citing the age of their chapter, even in a re-colonization. =Expansion Program= Phi Sigma Kappa supports a vigorous expansion program of two to four new chapters a year. Phi Sigma Kappa's new colonization efforts typically follow one of three methods: :* At the request of a viable interest group that contacts Phi Sigma Kappa :* By affiliation of an existing local fraternity into Phi Sigma Kappa :* As the result of planned expansion efforts by Headquarters staff. The Fraternity takes special interest in re-chartering chapters at schools where it previously had a chapter. In such cases, significant funds may be available to support housing or scholarships that have been held in trust, awaiting re-colonization, by alumni of the original chapter. Interested non-members can start an Interest Group at their school by contacting the Fraternity's HQ directly, or by joining a nearby active Phi Sig chapter. Unlike many national fraternities, Phi Sig allows a limited number of members from local, accredited schools in the area for this purpose. The Fraternity maintains several full-time staff members dedicated to expansion and the support of interest groups, colonies and new chapters. =Naming Rules & Colony List= Interest groups are named temporarily after the school. Where the Fraternity has previously had a presence, re-colonizing groups may refer to themselves by their original chapter name, with the word \\"Colony\\" appended. Colonies at schools where Phi Sig has not had a presence will be awarded a chapter name as their induction ceremony is scheduled. Where there is lack of progress or low membership, unsuccessful colonies may be disbanded before receiving a charter or series name. The 1985 merger resulted in the following naming compromises: :*In cases where an original Phi Sigma Kappa chapter as well as a Phi Sigma Epsilon chapter were present on campus but where both are now dormant, the designation of any new group would normally be the name of the older original chapter, with allowances based on alumni preference. See also the main section on Naming System. :*Phi Sigma Epsilon's practice was to name interest groups and colonies immediately. Because some colonies earned their charter within months, and others took up to four years, this resulted in a chapter roster that wasn't strictly alphabetical when listed by date of founding. The roster today, and this page, is maintained by chartering date, following Phi Sigma Kappa's practice. Buttons on the header field allow readers to sort by state, school, status, etc. :*Occasionally, a PSE colony was allowed a name that referenced a former local fraternity's original name: Shepherd College's Sigma Chi chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa, for example, which honors their former local name of Theta Sigma Chi. PSK's Sigma Chi chapter's name should not be confused with the national fraternity using that same name. Coincidentally, the earlier, local name Theta Sigma Chi remains in use by several groups: a local service organization at Oklahoma Baptist University, a local sorority at Bob Jones University, a local sorority at Austin University, and a Latina sorority at CSU Bakersfield. None of these are related in any way to the Phi Sigma Kappa chapter. :*Several Sigma-series names were never assigned, and there are no plans to use them. Colonies, listed below, are grouped first by those soon chartering, then by colonies, and finally by interest groups and planned expansion targets. Groups that have an active presence on campus are bolded. See also *Phi Sigma Kappa *ΦΣΚ's building acquisition entity: \\"PSK Properties\\" *Phi Sigma Epsilon, (includes more info on the many chapters that came from the merger) *Phi Sigma Phi, the spin-off group of a few PSE chapters from 1987 that rejected the merger. Notes * a. For a brief period, Alpha chapter called itself \\"Pi\\" because this was the initial letter of the Greek word for \\"first.\\" The Pi designation was used from 1878 coinciding with the first appearance of the public name of the Fraternity (that is, Phi Sigma Kappa) until the end of 1887. Similarly, Beta chapter at first had selected its name to be \\"Alden March chapter\\", after the name of the founder of that college. It was only when the petition came in from the group that would become Phi Sig's Gamma chapter at Cornell that the first two chapters accepted the names Alpha and Beta. * b. The oldest traditional fraternities (~junior societies) at Yale named their buildings with \\"Hall\\" nicknames, by which they wished to be known on campus: Thus Phi Sigma Kappa's Epsilon chapter adopted the name Sachem Hall. Similarly, the Theta Xi chapter was Franklin Hall, Delta Psi adopted the name St. Anthony Hall which spread to their entire small but old national fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta was Vernon Hall, Chi Phi was York Hall, Psi Upsilon became the Fence Club, and Delta Phi was known at Yale as St. Elmo's. ΦΣΚ's Sachem Hall was located at 124 Prospect Street.Tombs and Taps: An inside look at Yale's Fraternities, Sororities and Societies, accessed 14 April 2014 * c. The Tau chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa separated from the national organization in 1956 over the issue of racial discrimination and became Phi Tau coeducational local fraternity. Two months later, the short-lived policies that incited the separation were themselves dropped, and Phi Sigma Kappa became one of the first fraternities to welcome black students. * d. Cornell was the only school with active chapters of both Phi Sigma Kappa and Phi Sigma Epsilon when the two fraternities merged in 1985. Phi Sigma Epsilon's Phi Tau chapter was therefore released to join another national fraternity. It opted to join Theta Chi, but that chapter has since closed. As Theta Chi's alumni held another, larger building the chapter's former building was sold to Alpha Chi Omega sorority. More detail on this may be found in the references. * e. Zeta chapter's alumni are still active, and have established a significant pool of scholarship dollars administered by ΦΣΚ's national headquarters. The funds are available to any Phi Sig or their children who attend any of the four City College of NY schools for undergraduate or graduate work. * f. The Sigma Zeta chapter of Phi Sigma Epsilon did not participate in the merger with Phi Sigma Kappa. It eventually became a chapter of Phi Sigma Phi but, dissatisfied, was then re- established as a colony of Phi Sigma Kappa in 1996. * g. The Epsilon Septaton chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa reverted to its previous local affiliation of Delta Beta Chi in 1995. Kappa Septaton chapter likewise ended its affiliation with Phi Sigma Kappa in 2007 to become to the Beta chapter of Delta Beta Chi. Both local chapters are now dormant. This two-chapter group is not to be confused with the small national sorority of the same name. * h. 1952's \\"Bedford Resolution\\" was one of the reasons that led to the expulsion of Mu Triton at Boston University, which lost its charter in 1954. Similarly, Beta Triton at Knox seceded back to local status in 1955. Hartwick College's Nu Triton was closed for the same reason, also in 1955. All three are today dormant. * i. There exists some confusion regarding two chapters named Phi Tau. Phi Sigma Epsilon's Phi Tau chapter at Cornell was existent from 1963 until the merger with Phi Sigma Kappa in 1985 when it was released to join another national. The Fraternity retained its much older, original Gamma chapter. The former PSE chapter there should NOT be confused with Phi Sigma Kappa's Tau chapter at Dartmouth, which, upon seceding from the national fraternity in 1956, renamed itself Phi Tau. Name similarity is purely coincidental. * j. Both Phi Sigma Kappa and Phi Sigma Epsilon had chapters at Ferris State University. The Phi Sigma Kappa chapter closed in 1978. Phi Sigma Epsilon's Sigma Epsilon chapter became the Sigma Epsilon chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa when the two fraternities merged. * k. Greek systems have died out on some campuses. At times when the United States or Canada has entered a wartime posture or a period of significant manpower draft, such as World War I or World War II, weaker chapters of many fraternities have had to close, with some unable to recover after the war. Campus acceptance can vary, making re-establishment far more difficult: Fraternities and sororities remain unwelcome at Queen's University, of Kingston, Ontario where PSK's Rho Chapter failed when all members of the young chapter died in service during World War I or failed to return after the war. In response to efforts by other fraternities to form or re-form on the campus in the 1920s, that University's student senate (AMS) banned Greek societies in 1933. Likewise at St. John's College, in Annapolis, Maryland, PSK's weak Sigma Chapter failed to reopen after World War II at this classics- focused liberal arts school. Neither school has fraternities or sororities today. * l. Beginning in the late 1960s, several small eastern schools banned their fraternity systems out of egalitarian concerns, leading to alarm among fraternity executives that such a trend would be more widespread. However, their worst fears did not come to pass, and the trend fizzled. Indeed, some of these schools, reporting a marked drop in alumni giving, have rescinded such bans. For example, former long-time Phi Sig campuses Swarthmore College and Franklin and Marshall now allow Greek organizations to re-charter. Nevertheless, PSK's Chi Chapter at Williams College, of Williamstown, Massachusetts fell to the anti-Greek trend in 1966, and remains closed to recognized expansion today. Other institutions that have adopted an anti-Greek posture include Colby College which banned them outright and Amherst College, a private college in that same Massachusetts town where PSK was founded, on which campus fraternities nevertheless exist sub-rosa. Neither Colby or Amherst Colleges have ever hosted a Phi Sig chapter. * m. Sigma Phi Sigma was a fraternity of 18 chapters that was unable to re-kindle itself after World War II. Several of its largest groups affiliated into Phi Sigma Kappa, merging assets for the benefit of the combined organization after SPS's dissolution in 1947. These include an exceptionally sound chapter at Cal Berkeley, which merged into PSK's Omega chapter, and most of the ex-Nevada and Wisconsin chapter members who also sought PSK. In fact, alumni of the dormant Wisconsin chapters of both SPS and PSK merged their assets and worked together to re- establish Zeta Deuteron on the Wisconsin campus, where it had been defunct since 1931. The fine relationship PSK enjoyed with SPS at its dissolution was spurred by \\"notably excellent relations with PSK's Bro. Dean Palm and Bro. Bill Wood.\\"Bairds, page VIII-23 * n. The Epsilon Kappa chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa separated from the national organization in 1998 and became a local organization called Phi Sigma Chi fraternity. This is not to be confused with the NY-based multicultural fraternity of Phi Sigma Chi, with which the Stevens Point chapter has no connection. This now-local chapter has disbanded. * o. These four functioning chapters did not participate in the merger between Phi Sigma Kappa and Phi Sigma Epsilon. A total of seven (these four, plus a schismatic group of PSE Lambda chapter alumni who didn't transition into the new Epsilon Lambda, plus two revived chapters) would go on to form Phi Sigma Phi fraternity in 1988. See further discussion on the Talk page. * p. In its biggest loss to the co-ed movement which affected some fraternities on a few campuses in the 1970s, Phi Sigma Kappa's Nu Deuteron chapter at Stanford University voted to admit women in 1973, and thus voluntarily removed itself from the national fraternity by 'going local'. This action came just prior to the reintroduction of sororities on campus due to Title IX. Continuing to this day, its former building was retained by the group, still labeled as the \\"Phi Sig\\" house, and is one of many cooperative housing entities on campus. Its co- ed residents are called \\"Phi Sigs.\\" This group has no connection with the national fraternity at this time. Still, Phi Sigma Kappa has expressed a long- term goal of re-establishing itself on legacy campuses it has lost, such as Stanford.Website of the co-op group, with building photo., accessed 18 July 2016. * q. Phi Sigma Kappa's merger with Phi Sigma Epsilon meant occasional merger of alumni groups on campuses where both fraternities had, or previously had had a presence. At the 1985 merger, both may have been inactive, or one may have been active with the other dormant, or since that time a chapter may have been re-colonized, usually taking on the older chapter's name from that campus. In the single case where both fraternities had an active chapter at the time of the merger, at Cornell, the younger chapter was released. For purposes of this list, when a chapter name is bolded this indicates it is an active chapter. * r. The University of Wisconsin–Platteville chapter began as the Philadelphian Society in 1866, the year this school was founded. Sometime after 1893 they adopted the name Phi Sigma, continuing as a local fraternity. The group merged into Phi Sigma Epsilon in 1969, then followed that fraternity's merger with Phi Sigma Kappa in 1985. It withdrew or closed in 1991, possibly becoming dormant for a time. However, the group, now unaffiliated with Phi Sigma Kappa, has emerged with local alumni support as a local under its old name, Phi Sigma. Website accessed 16 Feb 2020. Name similarity to PSK's Phi Sigma chapter, at Hillsdale College is merely coincidental.

It was inaugurated in 2002 with the name Novo Museu or New Museum. With the conclusion of remodeling and the construction of a new annex, it was reinaugurated on July 8, 2003, with the current denomination to honor its famous architectMuseu Oscar Niemeyer em Curitiba Paraná who completed this project at 95 years of age. It is also known as Museu do Olho or Niemeyer's Eye (Eye Museum or Niemeyer's Eye), due to the design of the building. The museum focuses on the visual arts, architecture and design. For its magnificence, beauty and for the importance of the collection, it represents a cultural institution of international significance.http://www.praemiumimperiale.org/eg/press/pressrelease_13.html The complex of two buildings, installed in an area of 35 thousand square meters (of which 19 thousand are dedicated to exhibition space), it is a true example of architecture allied with art. The first building was designed by Oscar Niemeyer in 1967, faithful to the style of the time, and conceived as an educational institute, which was opened in 1978. The museum features many of Niemeyer's signature elements: bold geometric forms, sculptural curved volumes placed prominently to contrast with rectangular volumes, sinuous ramps for pedestrians, large areas of white painted concrete, and areas with vivid murals or paintings. Though rooted in modern architecture since his involvement in the international style, Niemeyer's designs have much in common with postmodern architecture as well and this is as contemporary a building as the artwork it displays. Niemeyer's Eye The distinctive annex to the Oscar Niemeyer Museum is reminiscent of a human eye and fundamentally gave the museum a new identity. The annex was completed and opened to the public in 2003, and the Novo Museu was renamed the Oscar Niemeyer Museum in the same year. Constructed of reinforced concrete, the idiosyncratic, 30-meter tall structure sits above a pool of water and is connected to the main museum building by a futuristic underground walkway. The annex contains a large spiral stairway among its levels, and the two diamond-shaped façades of the \\"eye\\" of the building are constructed of glass and steel and provide natural light to an exhibit space. Grounds The museum is located within a garden designed by the landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx, Niemeyer's previous collaborator on the design of Ibirapuera Park in Sao Paulo. The garden is further located within of woodland. Gallery CWB Olho Niemeyer 11 2013 7268.JPGFrontal view of Neimeyer's Eye.

Vaikhānasam is one of the principal traditions of Hinduism and primarily worships Vishnu (and his associated Avatars) as the Supreme God. The followers are mainly Brahmins of Krishna Yajurveda Taittiriya Shakha and Vaikhanasa Kalpasutra. The name Vaikhānasa stands for the followers and the fundamental philosophy itself with the name derived from founder, Sage Sri Vikhanasa. It is principally monotheistic in its philosophy, whilst also incorporating elements which could be described as being panentheistic. Vaikhanansas principle focuses on rituals and worship of Lord Vishnu rather than the philosophy of Uttara Mimamsa, unlike Vaishnavism, the larger and more prevalent form on Vishnu worship. Vaikhanasa bhagavath Shastra is the guiding principle for rituals in Tirumala Venkateswara temple. in vellore also there is a famous vishnu temple in kangeyanallur current shastri is srinivasa battachar and on saturdays his son thirukumaran takes it off History The Vaikhanasa Brahmins/Vaikhanasas originated as a group of ascetics. In the Manava Dharmasastra, Manu discusses vanaprastha, forest-dweller, the third of the four asramas, stages of life, and mentions a \\"Vaikhanasa rule.\\" Other ancient authorities support this reference, so it seems there was a Vaikhanasa ascetic community before the common era. They are mentioned in the Narayaniya, which is a late section of the Mahabharata of uncertain date but probably no earlier than the third century CE. Surviving Vaikhanasa sutras are no older than the fourth century CE. Inscriptions from perhaps the eighth century CE identify Vaikhanasas as temple priests, and from the end of the tenth century they are prominently mentioned in South Indian inscriptions. Vaikhanasas were the priests of Vishnu temples. They were not merely ritual priests, but were trusted with administering the temples and their lands. Śrī Bhagavad Rāmānujacharya, leader of the Śrī Vaiṣṇavas and the organiser of temple administration at Srirangam Temple, replaced the Vaikhanasa system of worship which came into practice with the Pañcaratra system {as the Pancharathra Priests who were in Srirangam relocated or moved to Melnadu [Karnataka Temples] and near Andhrapradesh due to many Muslim invasions in Srirangam - Reference Koil Ozhugu, Ganga Vijayam, Sri Araayairapadi Guruparambara Prabhavam}. During those time Vaikhanasa Priests saved the Srirangam Temple and worshipped the God with Sri Vaikanasa Agama Bagavath Shaastram. However Sri Ramanujacharya gave importance to both Vaikhanasas and Pancharathras as it is evident that he had not changed the Agama Rituals of Tirumala Tirupathi, Thirukarambanoor[Uthamar Kovil very nearer to Srirangam], Manakkal Nambi temple [Manakkal Nambi who administered Sri Vaishnavism before Sri Alavandar - Acharya/Guru of Sri Ramanujacharya], Tiruvallikeni Temple, Mylapore Sri Peiazhwar Temple which are very famous and popular SriVaishnava temples worshipped according to Sri Vaikanasa Agama rituals. Today Vaikhanasas are the chief priests in more than half of the Vaishnava temples in the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and parts of Karnataka. Their present- day temple activities are worthy of attention, as are their efforts to work for community integrity which is threatened by increasing social and technological changes.

Adherents The Vaikhanasa Brahmins/Vaikhanasas are a tiny vaishnavite Brahmin community of about 4000 families widely dispersed in South India at Vaishnava temples in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and parts of Karnataka and also worldwide especially in the United States of America, Germany, Australia, UK, and some parts of Europe.

Vaikhanasa tradition says the sage Vikhanasa, who was a manifestation of Lord Mahavishnu, had the Upanayanam along with Brahma consecrated by His father Lord Mahavishnu and educated under Lord Mahavishnu all the Vedas and Bhagawat Saastra on how to worship SriBhagawaan in His Archaavathaara - Iconic Form. Sri Vikhanasa Maharishi came down to earth's most holy place Naimisaaranyam composed the Vaikhanasa Kalpasutra and taught Sri Vaikhanasa Bhagawat Saastra to his four disciples viz., Atri, Bhrigu, Kashyapa and Marichi, respectively the procedures of Samurtarcana, Amurtarchana, devotional service to Vishnu in images. Most Vaikhanasa literature is almost completely concerned with rituals, prescribing the rituals and their rules of performance. To the Vaikhanasas their temple worship is a continuation of Vedic fire sacrifice. Regular and correct worship of Vishnu in a temple will bring the same results as the fire sacrifice even for people who do not maintain their fires. Jnana, knowledge, sections of Vaikhanasa texts are short and it is necessary to infer their doctrines from discussions in the texts on ritual. The Vaikhanasas evolved the theory of the five aspects of Vishnu: Vishnu, the all-pervading supreme deity; Purusha, the principle of life; Satya, the static aspect of deity; Achyuta, the immutable aspect; and Aniruddha, the irreducible aspect. The distinction is emphasised between Vishnu in his Niskala presence, the unfigured primeval and indivisible form unperceived even by Brahma, and his Sakala presence, the figured, divisible, emanated, and movable form. In his sakala presence he responds gracefully to devotional meditation. Shri is important as nature, Prakriti, and as the power, Shakti, of Vishnu. The Vaikhanasa doctrine states that Moksha is release into Vishnu's heaven. The nature of a man's Moksha is dependent on a devotee's service of Japa, attentive repetition of prayer, Huta, Yaaga, sacrifice, archana, service to images, or Dhyana, Yogic meditation. Of the four the Marichi Samhita says Archana is the realisation of all aims. Symbols Temples and images with the Vaikhanasas are of more importance than perhaps any other sect of Hinduism. In accordance with Vaikhanasa doctrine of the two forms of Vishnu, the Nishkala, the unfigured, and the Sakala, the figured, two cult images are distinguished. There is the large immovable image representing Vishnu's Niskala form, which is ritually placed in a sanctuary and elaborately consecrated, and a smaller movable image representing Vishnu's Sakala form. If the devotee wishes for temporal and eternal results he should worship both forms. But if he is after only eternal results he should worship the immovable image. After purification and meditation to identify with Vishnu, the devotee surrenders to Vishnu and places the movable image on a bathing pedestal and elaborately bathes it. This is preparation for receiving the presence of God by immediate contact via a connecting string. The invocation starts with a Mantra, sacred utterance, saying that the Imperishable is linked to the Perishable and that the Self is released from all evil as it knows God. Flowers are presented to all the deities present. Then the hymn called the Aatmasukta is recited that identifies the body of the devotee with the cosmos, followed by meditation on Vishnu's Niskala aspect: these parts of the ritual are to request Vishnu to take his Sakala form in the movable image so that the devotee can converse with Him. A Puja ceremony takes place with God as the royal guest, followed by a Homa, offering into the fire [Homaagni], and a Bali [offering-but not animal sacrifice] with something that may be visible, touchable, audible, or eatable. An offering of [Havis - anything offered as an oblation with fire], cooked food, is important as the God's meal. Afterwards the Prasaada (Food that was offered to God) is eaten by the worshipers and devotees. The offering area is cleaned and a Bali of cooked rice sprinkled with butter is offered to Vishnu. Then comes a Pradakshina [circumambulation from left to right clockwise as a kind of worship]around the temple. After Daksina, the officiating BrahmaN's share of the Prasadam, is given, Vishnu is meditated upon as the personal manifestation of the sacrifice. Finally Puspanjali [Mantra Pushpam], i.e., offering a handful of flowers at the God's lotus feet after chanting the holy Mantraas, and the temple door is closed after Mangala Haarathi.This External links related to Vaikhanasam *Sri Vikhanasa Maharshi *Vaikhanasam *Vaikhanasam Blog *Vaikhanasam Channel *Sri Vikhanasa Suprabhatam *Sri Vikhanasa Prapatti *PARAMATHMIKA UPANISHAD - (Sri Vaikhanasa Agamam) *Sri VAIKHANASA MAHASANTI MANTRAS RENDERED BY SANGENDHI DR S MUTHU BATTER  References  Sri Ramakrishna Dikshitulu and Oppiliappan Koil Sri Varadachari Sathakopan.

The object affected by the illusion is called the target, and the other moving objects are called the background or the context (Duncker, 1929). Induced movement with stationary target A stationary object appears to move in the opposite direction to the background. For example, the moon on a cloudy, windy night appears to be racing through the sky opposite to the direction of the clouds, though the moon is essentially stationary in the sky and only appears to be moving due to the movement of the clouds.

Traditionally, they are owned and operated by Indians. Unlike other stores such as 7-Eleven, mama shops are not air-conditioned and sell a variety of provisions within their limited area of approximately . Local residents often make use of mama shops as location markers.. History An Indian woman surrounded by goods stacked high in a mama shop in Singapore The earliest mama shops were started by the early Indian immigrants who were traders and businessmen. Many eventually became small shopkeepers along Serangoon Road in the early 20th century.. In its early days, the mama shop served mainly villagers in the vicinity. Since the shopkeeper was most likely to be the shop owner, service was rendered largely on a friendly and personal basis.. In earlier times many customers were granted unlimited credit, according to Ubid bin Ibrahim, co-owner of one of the oldest surviving mama shops.. Bargaining, discounting of prices and personal delivery of goods. were also common.

While in the villages they had catered mostly to housewives, they now were frequented by children who would stop at the stores to browse through thrift comics,. inexpensive sweets and cheap stationery. However, the resettlement caused a weakening in what had been a strong sense of community established back in the village, and many mama shops witnessed a loss in an otherwise frequent and loyal patronage. With the passing of time and increasing modernization, rising competition from air- conditioned mini-marts and upbeat convenience chain stores also dealt a blow to the survival of many traditional mama shops.

John Tannatt Ussher was the son of Samuel Ussher Esq., a lawyer in Montreal, and Harriet Rebecca Colclough. He was born October 17, 1830. On June 2, 1876 Ussher was named as a tax collector under the School Tax Act. On June 22, 1876, the Lieutenant- Governor in Council announced the appointment of John Ussher, Esq. to be Returning Officer for the District of Yale. The Provincial Secretary's office announced on January 27, 1877 that Johnny was appointed as Government Agent at Kamloops, and registrar for births, deaths and marriages, and land agents. Johnny Ussher married Annie Clara McIntosh, the youngest sister of his business partner James McIntosh, on October 21, 1878. In 1879 the renegade sons of former Fort Kamloops Chief Trader Donald McLean, led by his eldest son Allan and accompanied by their friend Alex Hare, went on a drunken rampage across the Nicola and Thompson Countries. The \\"Wild McLeans\\" went on a binge of horse-thievery and stealing flour, liquor, ammunition and clothing. Ussher, whose duties as Gold Commissioner included the roles of constable and jailer as well as magistrate and who had previously demurred on arresting the McLeans, as attempts to hold them in the flimsy jail in Kamloops would prove futile, rode out with John McLeod, with Amni Shumway as guide, and rancher William Palmer, whose prize stallion the McLeans had stolen. Ussher and his party surprised the McLeans at Long Lake (near Quilchena, on Nicola Lake) on 8 December 1879, and was killed in the ensuing gun battle, which also wounded McLeod and Allan McLean. Fleeing the consequences of Ussher's killing, the McLeans sought refuge with the Nicola people and made a speech to their chief Chilliheetza, son of the famous Chief Nicola, trying to enlist their support in a revived version of the abortive uprising planned by the Interior First Nations peoples in 1874. Chilliheetza refused, knowing that the boys' motivation was not political but caused by drink, and chastised them for their shameful behaviour. On December 13 the McLeans and Hare surrendered and were brought to the BC Penitentiary in New Westminster to await trial. They were, after a second trial had to be held because of technicalities, hanged for the murder of Johnny Ussher and sheepherder James Kelly on January 31, 1881. Ussher Lake is named for him.

It also later became an architectural term to designate an outdoor mihrab in a mosque, mainly in the Maghreb.  History and origin  The 'anaza was the spear (also known as a ḥarba) of the Prophet Muhammad and first appears as part of Muslim ritual in the year 624 CE (2 AH), when Muhammad celebrated the first Eid al-Fitr. When Muhammad and the other Muslims reached the musalla (outdoor prayer space), he planted the spear in the ground and used it to indicate the direction of prayers (the qibla), much like a mihrab would in later mosques. The spear was used in this way again on Eid al-Adha the same year. The early caliphs expanded on this practice, making it customary to carry a staff, sword, or bow on ceremonial occasions when ascending the pulpit (minbar), symbolizing authority. The image of the anaza planted in front of a mihrab arch also appears on some early Umayyad coinage.  Architectural feature  Perhaps related to this symbolic use as an early qibla indicator, the term \\"anaza\\" later came to be applied in to an architectural feature of many mosques in the western Maghreb and Morocco. It was used to designate an \\"outdoor\\" or \\"summer\\" mihrab, usually an ornate wooden screen that stood at the border between the sahn (courtyard) of a mosque and its interior prayer hall and which was aligned with the mosque's central mihrab axis. This anaza could thus serve as a mihrab for prayers held outside in the courtyard. The wooden screen was often carved and painted with a stylized mihrab motif and other inscriptions. The anaza could also be a simple mark on the pavement or floor of the courtyard in front of the prayer hall's central entrance; e.g. a semi-circular groove or recess in the middle of the step leading to the entrance. Wooden anazas were constructed in mosques across Morocco and the Maghreb. In Morocco they became a standard feature of \\"grand mosques\\" or Friday mosques in particular. The oldest surviving example is the anaza of the al-Andalusiyyin Mosque in Fez, which dates from 1209 (from the Almohad period). Historical sources also mention an even older anaza, dating from 1129 (during the Almoravid period), at the Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fez, but it no longer exists today and has been replaced by the current Marinid-era anaza which was fabricated between 1288 and 1290. The anaza in the Grand Mosque of Fes el-Jdid, which likely dates from the mosque's construction in 1276, is very similar and might be the oldest Marinid anaza. A similar example is also found in the Grand Mosque of Meknes but was built much later in 1715 (during the reign of the Alaouite sultan Moulay Ismail). Some other post-Marinid examples also include the anaza of the 16th-century Mouassine Mosque in Marrakesh (from the Saadian period). The anaza of the near-contemporary Bab Doukkala Mosque in Marrakesh, on the other hand, is a modern replacement of the original one.

It was constructed between November 1993 and late 1995. The total cost of the building was nearly RM 2,000,000 and out of which RM 100,000 was donated by the Prime Minister's Department. Donations were received from the Sikh Sangat from all over Malaysia to complete this project. Donations from All over Malaysia - Retrieved on 24 April 2007 Before residing at the current location in Jalan Bukit Jawa, it was relocated once, at Jalan Raya Barat beside the Majlis Perbandaran Klang (Klang Municipal Council) Headquarters. It is the main place of worship for Sikhs living in Klang. The gurdwara was officially opened by the sangat on February 17, 1996. The Sikh Holy Book, the Guru Granth Sahib, was respectfully taken in a procession from the previous Gurdwara Sahib in Jalan Raya Barat to its new location in Jalan Bukit Jawa. The Dasmesh Band headed by Sardar Sukhdev Singh led the procession. Akhand Path prayers were held on the following day. The top floor comprises the Darbar Sahib, which can accommodate about 1,000 people. The ground floor consists of a langar (dining hall), a kitchen, an office and a library, visitors' rooms and classrooms for holding Punjabi classes. The Granthi's quarters are located in a separate building adjacent to the Darbar Sahib. History By the late 19th century, Klang town was an important commercial trading center. Many Sikhs were employed by the Federated Malay States Police to maintain law and order. Gradually, more Sikhs arrived in Klang and became watchmen, money lenders, dairy farmers, bullock cart operators and chauffeurs. In 1900, there were about 50 Sikhs in Klang. They built their first gurdwara on a piece of land about in size. The first Gurdwara Sahib building was a wooden structure with an \\"attap\\" roof. This Gurdwara Sahib land was formally gazetted as a Sikh Temple Reserve in 1931. By 1930, there were about 200 Sikhs living in and around Klang and the Gurdwara Sahib was inadequate to accommodate the ever-growing sangat. Between 1933 and 1934, a double storey wooden building with a tiled roof was built on the site of the original Gurdwara Sahib. The land area was expanded to . In 1972, the land area was further expanded by another . The gurdwara building was then repaired, renovated and refurbished. By 1985, the Sikhs residing in Klang, Kapar, Meru, Kuala Selangor and Banting, who by this time numbered about 1,200 people, were attending religious functions in the Klang Gurdwara Sahib. Therefore, the need for bigger premises arose, but there was no land available to expand the Gurdwara Sahib. In August 1989, the Government offered the Sikh community of Klang a new site about an acre in size, Lot Number 970, which is the location of the present Gurdwara Sahib. Religious activities conducted by the gurdwara There are presently about 300 Sikh families who participate in the religious activities in this Gurdwara Sahib. There are also about 250 students who attend Punjabi classes once a week on Saturday afternoons. The Management Committee comprises the President, Secretary, Treasurer, their assistants and five committee members. There is a Sikh Assistant Registrar of Marriages in this Gurdwara Sahib who officiates at Sikh marriages. Actual marriage ceremonies are conducted by the Granthi in accordance with Sikh rites.

Biography =Family background= Charles Stuart Curtis was born to George Curtis and Eliza Curtis (née Newsham) in Omata, Taranaki, on 15 December 1850. His parents and siblings had emigrated to New Zealand from London earlier that same year. Arriving at Port Nicholson, his father had walked overland from Wellington to New Plymouth, and made preparations for his family, who arrived there on 7 February 1850. They took up a farm in the new settlement of Omata, and George also became the senior partner of Curtis and Watt, a wholesale merchant and agent of Lloyd's in New Plymouth. =First Taranaki War= War broke out between settlers and Māori in 1860, and as a result Eliza and the children moved to New Plymouth. George remained at the Omata stockade, but after seeing his home burned to the ground, and to avoid the epidemics plaguing the crowded town of New Plymouth, the Curtis family evacuated to Nelson. They remained there until the hostilities ceased in 1861, then returned to their land at Omata. =Business= George Curtis became a prominent leader in commercial matters in the province of Taranaki, representing Omata on the Taranaki Provincial Council. Charles worked with his father in their Omata store, and quickly picked up the same business acumen which proved invaluable to his own commercial ventures in the new settlement of Stratford. =Pioneers at Stratford= In October 1878 Charles and his brother Herbert erected the first permanent building in the newly opened bush settlement of Stratford, a site for which the first sections had been sold in August of that year. Herbert and another brother George ran a butchery in the nearby settlement of Inglewood, and together with Charles he established a similar operation at Stratford in conjunction with yet another brother, Oswald. The business operated as a butchery, a merchant store, and also a bakery, and due to its quick growth the Curtis Brothers replaced their temporary premises with a two-storey building and bakehouse in January 1879. The store also provided postal services for the town until a railway station was erected in 1880. On 3 April 1880, Curtis married Emma Clara Low at Omata Church. Together they had two children; Minnie and Henry. Curtis was a member of the Town Board from its inception in 1882, and in 1885 was elected Chairman, replacing his brother George who had been the inaugural Chairman from 1882. Charles continued as Town Board chairman, or Town Clerk, until 1890. A private development of Curtistown was named for the family, as was a street in this development. The streets of Curtistown remained in private ownership until 1899. Curtis also made a name for himself as he and his brothers explored the eastern slopes of Mount Taranaki/Egmont and cut the original track on that face. With T. H. Penn and Frank Arden he completed the first recorded alpine circuit of the mountain over Christmas 1888, during which they named an eastern ridge and a Manganui River waterfall after Curtis. Charles' wife Emma was also a mountaineer, and was the first woman known to reach the summit by the Stratford Road track. Curtis was also a founding member of the Stratford Bowling Club. Curtis and his wife eventually retired to New Plymouth. He died on 4 April 1923, aged 72. See also *List of mayors of Stratford, New Zealand References * Day, Kelvin.

This is commonly used in countries using British English, including countries of the Commonwealth. In the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, the agreement between landlord and tenant is normally formalised by the signing of a tenancy agreement. A letting agency will normally charge a commission for their services, usually a percentage of the annual rent. Letting agents will often operate under the umbrella of an Estate Agent due to the synergies that exists between the two professions, but there are many agents that deal exclusively with lettings. Although there are two main types of renting, letting agents deal primarily with tenancies between private individuals and landlords.  Services and fees  There are a number of services offered by lettings agents, including: *An Introductory Service - Finding a tenant for a landlord's property. The cost can vary depending on the agent and is usually charged up-front. *Administration Services - This is anything that is involved in processing of the application. This can include referencing (credit searches etc.), drawing up a tenancy agreement, conducting a check-in, drawing up a schedule of condition, among other things. Fees for this service can vary widely and often non-refundable, unless the landlord withdraws from the process. Such fees have been made illegal in Scotland and tenants may reclaim any fees paid through the courts. *Rent Collection - Many agents will offer to collect the rent from a tenant for an additional commission. This cost can vary. *Full Management - This is the day-to-day management of a rental property. Many agents will provide this service for landlords who wish to have a hands off approach to their investment. This service can cost between 7% and 12.5%. Typical letting agent fees to tenants in England and Wales may include: *Administration fee - To cover the Administration Services mentioned above *Inventory fee - To cover the costs of inspecting the property and drawing up an inventory *Tenancy extension/renewal fee - A renewal fee can be charged if the tenant extends their tenancy beyond the initial term. Renewal fees can vary in cost but tend to be at lower rate than the original referencing fee *Exit fee - Similar to the inventory fee to cover the cost of a final inspection of the property to compare its condition to that at the start of the tenancy The chancellor, Philip Hammond, promised to ban letting agent fees in England and Wales in his autumn statement of November 2016. To maximise the service that a letting agent provides it is important prospective tenants to make letting agents aware of their requirements before they arrange viewings so that properties are better matched to tenant's needs. Since letting agents act as a matchmaker between property, landlord and tenant it is important for them to gain an understanding of customer requirements including; location, property size, budget, pets, etc.  Regulation  There are currently no statutory arrangements regarding the regulation of letting agents. Around half of UK lettings agents are currently self-regulated. The principal organisations for lettings agents are the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA) and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). These have codes of practice and compliance controls which govern the activities of their members. The English government also provides its own accrediting body for letting agents. This body is called NALS (National Assured Letting Scheme). In Scotland all landlords must be registered with the local authority. Whilst agents are not required to register, they are actively encouraged to do so.

This movie was shot in 3D CGI, unlike the 2D Flash-animated series. An initial budget of $1 million was given to produce a \\"test film\\" to show to international partners. According to Marmelad-media's general director Ilya Popov, the final budget would depend on a number of factors, such as whether it will be sold internationally (in which case the budget would be up to $15 million) or limited to Russia (in which case it will cost around $3–4 million). Popov considered spending anything over $5 million to be unprofitable (the highest-grossing Russian animated film to date, Ilya Muromets and Nightingale the Robber, cost $2.5 million and made just under $10 million;Ilya Muromets and Nightingale the Robber profile at Kinoafisha.ru. Accessed on: November 20, 2008. since around half of the profits usually go to the distributors, if it had cost over $5 million it would not have been profitable). The film was released domestically in December 2011, but received a limited release in the UK in early 2012. In the United States the film was released by Columbia Pictures. The film is considered a well thought-through prequel, its plot explaining events that brought the nine animal characters together in the first place.

Air pollution in Hong Kong is considered a serious problem. Visibility is less than eight kilometres for 30 per cent of the year. Cases of asthma and bronchial infections have soared in recent years due to reduced air quality.  Effects  Declining regional air quality means visibility has also decreased dramatically. In 2004, low visibility occurred 18 per cent of the time, the highest on record, according to the Hong Kong Observatory. Hong Kong is approaching the record of being the darkest city in the world with the fewest sunlight hours, just after Edinburgh, Scotland. = Health implications = The mortality rate from vehicular pollution can be twice as high near heavily travelled roads, based on a study conducted in the Netherlands at residences 50 metres from a main road and 100 metres from a freeway. Since millions of people in Hong Kong live and work in close proximity to busy roads, this presents a major health risk to city residents. The Hong Kong Medical Association estimates that air pollution can exacerbate asthma, impair lung function and raise the risk of cardio-respiratory death by 2 to 3 per cent for every increase of 10 micrograms per cubic metre of pollutants. Studies by local public health experts have found that these roadside pollution levels are responsible for 90,000 hospital admissions and 2,800 premature deaths every year. In 2009 the Australian government highlighted that air pollution in Hong Kong could exacerbate some medical conditions. Former Chief Executive Donald Tsang declared that the high life-expectancy of Hong Kong demonstrates that concerns over air quality were not justified. Professor Anthony Hedley, chair of community medicine at Hong Kong University, said: \\"Tsang is badly advised on current public health issues.\\" Hedley added that air pollution levels in Hong Kong were extremely high, and could affect the lungs, blood vessels and heart. James Tien, former Chairman of the Liberal Party of Hong Kong, retorted, \\"Can [Tsang] really be confident that, if pollution continues to worsen, will he be able to promise the same life expectancy for our children and for our grandchildren?\\" = Economic impact = Even as early as 2000, the total negative impact to the Hong Kong Economy, including cardiorespiratory disease was in excess of HK$11.1 billion. About 1,600 deaths a year might be avoided if air quality improves. Made aware of fresh statistical and anecdotal evidence that pollution is driving away business and hurting Hong Kong's global competitiveness, James Tien called air pollution \\"a health issue, a lifestyle issue, a tourism issue, a business issue, and increasingly a political issue.\\"Jonathan Cheng, Lot of hot air on pollution, claims Tien , The Standard, 4 December 2006 Merrill Lynch downgraded several Hong Kong property companies because of air quality concerns, and there have been warnings from the head of the Stock Exchange that pollution was scaring investors away. It said that the air quality in Hong Kong is now regularly so poor that its \\"long-term competitiveness is in some doubt\\", and advised clients to switch into developers in Singapore instead.Our future up in the air , William Pesek, The Standard, 8 December 2006 Pollution is dramatically harming not only the health of citizens of Hong Kong but also its economy, particularly relating to the ability to attract skilled foreign labour.Hong Kong Wheezes as China's Industrial Economy Belches Smog, Bloomberg, 13 October 2005 The chairman of the Danish Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said each year at least two or three people decline offers to work in the Hong Kong offices of member companies because of pollution: \\"It's going to cost us in the future if we don't clean up here\\". \\"Five years ago, air quality wasn't a concern when people considered whether to relocate to Hong Kong\\", said Jardine Engineering Corp. Chief Executive James Graham. \\"In the past, one of the advantages was clean air. We can no longer say that\\". A London-based human resources consultant recommends that companies pay a 10 per cent hardship allowance to lure expatriates, partly because of air quality.  Causes  As per the Clean Air Network, 53% of Hong Kong's pollution comes from local sources – power stations, idling engines of cars, trucks and buses and marine emissions. Hong Kong has only 5% of the land of the Pearl River Delta, but it creates 20% of its pollution, far more than its neighbouring cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou. A large portion of this pollution comes from coal- fired power stations in Hong Kong and vehicular traffic. A significant contribution wafts down from the tens of thousands of factories in China's neighboring manufacturing heartland of the Pearl River Delta. The two major electricity companies of Hong Kong, namely China Light and Power and HK Electric Holdings emit more than 75,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide into Hong Kong's air daily. At 275 vehicles per kilometer, Hong Kong also has among the highest density of vehicles in the world.  Air-quality monitoring  = Air Pollution Index - EPD= The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) in Hong Kong was established to solve problems and provide for a long lasting acceptable level of air quality.6.4 Air Quality Objectives - Environment Hong Kong 2006, Environmental Protection Department, Accessed 2007-05-22 In June 1995, instead of adopting internationally accepted benchmark index for pollution, it set up the Air Pollution Index as an indicator to pollution levels, both \\"General\\" and \\"Roadside\\". Air Quality Objectives (AQOs) for seven widespread air pollutants were established in 1987 under the Air Pollution Control Ordinance (APCO), and have not been reviewed since it was set up. It is not clear how the levels are determined. In October 2005, Task Force on Air Pollution criticised the Government for deluding itself with a pollution index that is a \\"meaningless\\" indicator of health risks. Professor Wong Tze-wai, at the Chinese University of Hong Kong commented that the current air pollution index \\"gives a false sense of security\\". Gary Wong, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and School of Public Health, said that under the current index, \\"some harmful pollution components aren't even recorded.\\" In addition, he pointed out that there is no strategic plan or a timetable to tackle the problem, unlike in other countriesAlbert Wong, Our air is killing us , The Standard, 29 October 2005 Street-level air quality regularly falls short of the government's Air Quality Objectives (AQOs), and even further short of the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines, revised in October. Academics called for Hong Kong Government to immediately update its air quality objectives set almost twenty years ago.Tsang hit for \`naive' comments , Mimi Lau, The Standard, 28 November 2006 (quoted during the Business for Clear Air conference) For example, on 19 and 20 November 2006, roadside levels of respirable suspended particulates (RSPs – equivalent to PM10) exceeded the WHO guidelines by at least 300 per cent. Prof Anthony Hedley of the University of Hong Kong said in September 2007 that if Hong Kong's Air Pollution Index was based on WHO recommended levels, our readings would be \\"absolutely sky high\\" for most of the year.Pollution index based on index set 20 years ago, p5, South China Morning Post, 30 September 2007 Secretary for Environment, Transport and Works Sarah Liao Sau-tung said the WHO targets were too stringent. Air quality monitoring by the Department are carried out by 11 general stations and three roadside stations. On 8 March 2012, the Department started reporting data on fine suspended particulates in the air on an hourly basis, that are a leading component of smog. It began regular monitoring of PM2.5 levels, which measure particles 2.5 micrometres (µm) in diameter or less, at three stations since 2005, but the data were never publicized.Foo, Kenneth \\"Action stations as air monitoring fine-tuned\\" The Standard. 9 March 2012. Retrieved 9 March 2012 = Real Air Pollution Index - Greenpeace= In September 2008, Greenpeace East Asia's Hong Kong office launched its \\"Real Air Pollution Index\\" as part of a campaign to get the government to update the Air Pollution Index to match WHO guidelines. The Real Air Pollution Index reports hourly pollution levels from 15 monitoring stations across the region and compares them to WHO standards.  Actions implemented  = Switch to cleaner motor fuels = All HK taxis and PLBs now run on LPG. Sign on taxi showing its new LPG status = Incentives for scrapping pre-Euro IV vehicles = In 2014, an ex gratia payment scheme was introduced to encourage vehicle-owners to scrap about 82,000 pre-Euro VI vehicles. This included a Citybus AEC Routemaster, which attracted controversy for its resulting loss of transport heritage.  Organizations working against air pollution  = Clear The Air Hong Kong = Clear the Air is a charity organisation committed to improving air quality in Hong Kong. Current projects include: *Diesel – Recent government policies centred on voluntary schemes to phase out old polluting diesel vehicles (pre Euro 3) have proven ineffective. Further campaigns have to mandate a compulsory and scheduled phasing out of old polluting vehicles. *Energy – Aim to reduce harmful pollutants (PM2.5) from power station emissions through more stringent Air Quality Objectives (AQO). Work to improve energy savings and efficiency in all public and private buildings across Hong Kong. *Events & Education – Participating in and/or driving various territory wide environmental events and educational programs on clean air. *Idling Engines – Successful idling engine patrols have highlighted awareness among the public and the government of increased road side pollution leading to a ban on idling engines across Hong Kong to be tabled at Legco. *Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) – Free IAQ assessments for schools to be extended; the first campaign started April 2008. *Marine – Research conducted to implement a \\"smoky vessel spotter\\" scheme. More needs to be done to establish a Clean Port Policy scheme. *Tobacco – Clear The Air is advocating the Government to license all tobacco retailers, pressing the Financial Secretary to increase tobacco tax, pressing Legco to rescind the flawed qualified establishment exemptions and educating the public that the true cost of smoking to Hong Kong society is in excess of $73.32 billion per year. *Town Planning – Clear The Air defends the benchmark of \\"canyon effect\\" and Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) to auto-regulate urban traffic density.  Actions discussed = July 2006 Action Blue Sky Campaign = The Action Blue Sky Campaign was an environmental campaign organised by the Environmental Protection Department, and launched by Chief Executive Donald Tsang in July 2006. Its campaign slogan in Chinese was \\"全城投入 為藍天打氣\\" (\\"Let all of the city join in to fight for a blue sky\\"), while its campaign slogan in English is \\"Clean Air for a Cool Hong Kong!\\" The campaign hoped to win support from the public as well as the business community, including those businesses investing in the Pearl River Delta Region. = November 2007 vehicle idling ban= In November 2007, the government launched a public consultation on the proposal which would impose a fixed penalty of HK$320 on drivers who would violate a ban on idling, with taxi and minibus drivers likely to bear the brunt of the ban. The government said its action is due to the failure of motorists to heed many past campaigns switch off engines while waiting. Taxi and minibus drivers were opposed to the proposal.Winnie Chong, \\"'Idle' talk sparks heated debate\\" , The Standard, 3 November 2007 It is illegal for any driver to leave their engine running if they get out of their vehicle. The courts have been awarding fines of HK$700. It is also illegal for taxis to loiter and minibuses to stop longer than necessary to pick up or put down passengers. It is also illegal to park anywhere except in a designated parking place. This means that the vast majority of drivers who idle their engines are already in violation of at least one existing traffic safety law. However, traffic wardens are under strict policy guidelines not to give out any tickets unless there has already developed a \\"serious\\" obstruction of the roadway or there have been multiple complaints made by the public; this is the \\"Selective Traffic Enforcement Policy\\" (STEP).Traffic Safety is the Goal- Cleaner Air is the Result Traffic safety policing of idling vehicles, therefore, falls to private organisations like \\"mini spotters\\" who act as volunteer traffic wardens, making statements to police that can be prosecuted without traffic wardens having to issue tickets directly to the transport trade. = 2008–09 Budget measures = In the 2008–09 Budget, Financial Secretary John Tsang proposed a 100 per cent profit tax deduction for capital expenditure on environmentally friendly machinery and equipment in the first year of purchase, to encourage the business community to go green. He also suggested shortening the depreciation period of this equipment from the usual 25 years to 5 years. Neither proposal was actually passed. = New goals for 2014 = In January 2014, Secretary for the Environment Edward Yau Tang-wah announced that the HK government would update its air quality objectives, put in place in 1990, bringing them closer to WHO guidelines. According to the proposals, which will be set through legislation but have yet to be approved, seven types of emissions will be monitored. Respirable and fine particulates will also be monitored, but less stringently due to their more pronounced health impact. Targets set for three of the seven environmental pollutants are to be based on the WHO's loosest interim targets. Sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and lead would be subject to monitoring. Monitoring of particulates smaller than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) would be introduced under the proposals, but will be loosest of the three WHO interim targets. Yau asserted some local pollution had roots in mainland China, but did not mention any ongoing dialogue to address the issue with mainland authorities. Yau also did not address roadside pollution in Hong Kong.Ng, Joyce (18 January 2012). \\"Clean-air targets don't measure up, critics say\\", South China Morning Post In total, 22 measures in all were suggested to contribute towards meeting the new objectives. Such measures would include phasing out heavily polluting vehicles, promoting hybrid or electric vehicles, and increasing the use of natural gas, but no actions have yet to be taken. Environmental impact assessments of projects such as the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge were conducted and approved under the old air-quality guidelines. Mike Kilburn from Civic Exchange and Professor Hedley of the University of Hong Kong expressed their disappointment, saying that it too little, and too long overdue. Kilburn said: \\" It is a move that we have been waiting years for years but we are extremely disappointed as the objectives are not strict enough to make any positive impact on air quality.\\"Foo, Kenneth (18 January 2012). \\"Clearing the air\\" . The Standard. Other environmental activists shared little hope in government efforts to reduce pollution and lamented the half-hearted implementation of measures, and the elusiveness of timetable for meeting the most stringent objectives.

Its population is Maronite Catholic. Demographics The current estimate is that 1157 people live in Aitou in about 200 houses. The people of Aitou are typically followers of the Maronite Catholic church. It is also estimated, according to some statistics, that in the U.S. there are about 14,000 immigrants from Aitou; most of whom live in Peoria, Illinois and have formed the Itoo Society. The Itoo Society was established in 1914 for several purposes: creating and maintaining unity among the Aitou community in Peoria, maintaining strong ties to the families remaining in Aitou and providing for the general welfare of both the Aitou community in Peoria and the citizens of the village of Aitou. There are also many immigrants from Aitou who live in Venezuela, Australia, Brazil, and some European countries.About Aitou Famous People from Aitou The most renowned individuals from Aitou or descendants of Lebanese from Aitou are: *Ray LaHood, U.S. Secretary of Transportation *Monseigneur Michael Torbey. *Joseph Hitti, bishop *Bishop Hanna Alwan, Father Khalil Alwan, Superior General of the Lebanese Missionaries, Sister Vincent Alwan Superior General of Saint Vincent de Paul order. *Tonnous Fouad Gerges \\"Tony Sleiman\\" businessman and owner for Reporte newspaper and a Venezuelan bank.

Etymology With a Qaf (Qaitou), the name in Aramaic could mean summer, heat or boar.Moubarac, Youakim (1984): Pentalogie Antiochienne/Domaine Maronite, Tome II, Volume 2, Cenacle Libanais, Beirut, Page 587. It is equivalent to the Arabic Qaiz (), meaning canicule or heat wave. It could refer to Aitou being used as a Summer Resort given the town's location at a high elevation, yet only 27 km from the Mediterranean coast. With a Ghayn (Ghaithou), it could mean anger, rage (Arabic equivalent: ). With an Aleph ('Aitou), it could mean thick, obscure, magic in reference maybe to the thick forests or the thick fog that characterizes the summer evenings in this area. Geography Aitou is a mountainous village, located 113 km from Beirut and 27 km from Tripoli, Lebanon. The town occupies the northern slopes of Mount Lebanon at an elevation ranging between 900 and 1300 meters above sea level. History =Antiquity= In antiquity, Aitou was famous for its oak and cedar forests. An Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription sent by Pharaoh Pepi II to one of the kings of Byblos, asking for a number of trees from the woods of the God Aitou in order to extract the resin used by the Egyptians for embalmment is indicative of the importance of the forests of Aitou in ancient times. The hieroglyphic inscription is found today at the National Museum of Beirut. =Ottoman period= After the settlement of the Maronites in Mount Lebanon in the 5th Century, there was a Muqaddam in Aitou counted among the Maronite leaders.Al Qattar, Elias (1998): Muqaddamiat Jebbet Bsharri fi Al-Ahed Al- Othmani, First Congress of Jebbet Bsharri, Gibran National Committee, Bsharri, page 306. The rule of the Aitou Muqaddam seems to have been limited to the nearby region till 1519. In 1517, one year after the beginning of the Ottoman rule in Lebanon, the Muqaddam of Bsharri, Elias, died leaving the rule of the region to his young son Hanna, known later as Abdel Muneem.El Douaihy, Estephane (1982): Tarikh Al Azminah, version of Abbot Boutros Fahed, Dar Lahd Khater, Beirut, page 398. In 1519, the Muqaddam of Aitou, Kamal Eddine Ibn Abdel Al-Wahhab, known as Ibn Ajramah (), profiting from the confusion and the young age of the Muqaddam of Bsharri, seized the power in Jebbet Bsharri. He was married to Sitt El Moulouk (), a cousin of the Muqaddam of Bsharri. Sitt Al Moulouk played an important role in the take-over out of revenge because the family branch of her father, the Sheikh Alwan, was evicted from power in Jebbet Bsharri previously.Al Qattar, Elias (1998): Muqaddamiat Jebbet Bsharri fi Al-Ahed Al-Othmani, First Congress of Jebbet Bsharri, Gibran National Committee, Bsharri, page 315. In the first Ottoman census of Jebbet Bsharri done in that same year, Aitou was credited with 28 male adults, 24 of them married.Khalīfah, Iṣām Kamāl (1995): Abhath Fi Tarikh Loubnan Ash-Shamali, Private Editor, Hadtoun, Lebanon, page 79. The Muqaddam of Aitou, Ibn Ajramah, ruled Jebbet Bsharri for 18 years. He built a castleThe Arabic expression used by El Douaihy to describe the castle built by Ibn Ajramah in Aitou is Burj Sharif, which means Noble Castle. Could we see there a reference to a mosque? We do not know the religion of Ibn Ajramah. Given his name, he could be a Muslim. Usually, Historians agree that the commonly called Maronite Muqaddams used to take Muslim names since the Mamluks period in order to facilitate their relations with the Muslim rulers but they were in fact either Christian Maronites or Christian Jacobites. We know from Douaihy that, after his assassination, Ibn Ajramah was buried behind the Church of Mar Sarkis and not inside it as we could expect for a leader of such importance in those times. in Aitou and accumulated copious amounts of wealth. In 1532, Abdel Muneem () of Bsharri succeeded in getting back the rule on half of the region from Bsharri to Hadath El Jebbeh, the other half from Blaouza to Aitou staying under the rule of Ibn Ajramah of Aitou.El Douaihy, Estephane (1982): Tarikh Al Azminah, version of Abbot Boutros Fahed, Dar Lahd Khater, Beirut, page 410. In 1537, Abdul Muneem of Bsharri killed Ibn Ajramah of Aitou by stabbing him with his spear. The killing took place in the village of Blaouza. Ibn Ajramah was buried in Aitou behind the church of Mar Sarkis.El Douaihy, Estephane (1982): Tarikh Al Azminah, version of Abbot Boutros Fahed, Dar Lahd Khater, Beirut, page 412. This episode marked the end of the Muqaddams of Aitou. But the wife of Ibn Ajramah, the above-mentioned Sitt El Moulouk, took eventually her revenge by paying mercenaries to assassinate Abdul Muneem in 1547, ending also this dynasty of Bsharri's Muqaddams as no male descendant was alive.El Douaihy, Estephane (1982): Tarikh Al Azminah, version of Abbot Boutros Fahed, Dar Lahd Khater, Beirut, page 417-418. In the second Ottoman census of 1571, Aitou had 46 male adults, 40 of them being married.

He first appeared in the novel At the Earth's Core, serialized in four parts in All-Story Weekly from April 4–25, 1914 and issued in book form in hardcover by A. C. McClurg in July, 1922. Associated Novels =The early novels= David Innes is introduced in the first Pellucidar novel, At the Earth's Core, as a mining heir who finances the experimental \\"iron mole,\\" an excavating vehicle designed by his elderly inventor friend Abner Perry. In a test run, they discover the vehicle cannot be turned, and it burrows 500 miles into the Earth's crust, emerging into the unknown interior world of Pellucidar. In Burroughs' concept, the Earth is a hollow shell with Pellucidar as the internal surface of that shell. It is inhabited by prehistoric creatures of all geological eras, and dominated by the Mahars, a species of flying reptile both intelligent and civilized, but which enslaves and preys on the local stone-age humans. Innes and Perry are enslaved by the Mahars' ape-like Sagoth servants and eventually lead a revolt of humankind. To further the struggle Innes travels in the iron mole back to the surface world at the end of the first novel to procure outer world technology. Innes returns to the inner world in the second novel, Pellucidar. With the aid of the resources he brings the human revolt succeeds. In the course of the two books Innes wins the love of the cave-woman Dian the Beautiful, defeating rival suitors Jubal the Ugly One and Hooja the Sly One. Finally Innes and Perry succeed in building a confederacy of human tribes into an \\"Empire of Pellucidar\\" that wipes out the Mahar cities and establishes a new human civilization in their place. =The middle novels= The books after the first two show Innes' new empire as a relatively small entity in a world by and large still primitive and savage, and even his own subjects as little affected or changed by the trappings of civilization. Innes himself appears a somewhat hapless figure, brave and resourceful, yet ultimately dependent on the superior survival skills of his friends. Years after his initial adventures, as the surface world measures time, Innes confronts a new threat, the Korsars, a nation of pirates descended from corsairs of the outer world, who had entered Pellucidar generations before through a natural polar opening connecting the outer and inner worlds. The tale is the subject of the third novel, Tanar of Pellucidar, told by his native friend Tanar and relayed to the surface by Perry via radio. The adventure ends with Innes a captive of the Korsars. He is a secondary character in this novel, and a minor one in the two that follow. In response to Perry's plea, an outer world expedition is launched to rescue Innes, in which Burrough's jungle hero Tarzan plays a major role. The rescue effort is the subject of the fourth novel, Tarzan at the Earth's Core, with Tarzan entering Pellucidar in an airship via the polar opening and eventually succeeding in rescuing Innes. The fifth novel, Back to the Stone Age, details the adventures of a lost expedition member, ultimately located by the liberated Innes. =The late novels= The Sixth novel, Land of Terror, returns Innes to the central role, relating his adventures during his return from his search mission to Sari, the capital of his empire. Savage Pellucidar, the final book in the series, presents a new sequence of adventures for Innes, Perry, and Dian, in which a hitherto unknown native Bronze Age civilization is discovered. In other media *David Innes first appeared on screen in At the Earth's Core (1976), an adaptation of the first Pellucidar novel. He was portrayed by actor Doug McClure. *David Innes has also appeared in a comic strip and comic book series based on the novels, as well as the Tarzan comic strip.

In 1816 he laid an eight-mile length of iron wire between wooden frames in his mother's garden and sent pulses using electrostatic generators. Upbringing and family Born to merchants Francis Ronalds and Jane (née Field) at their cheese-monger business in Upper Thames Street, London, he attended Unitarian minister Eliezer Cogan's school before being apprenticed to his father at the age of 14 through the Drapers' Company. He ran the large business for some years. The family later resided in Canonbury Place and Highbury Terrace, both in Islington, at Kelmscott House in Hammersmith, Queen Square in Bloomsbury, at Croydon, and on Chiswick Lane. Several of Ronalds' eleven brothers and sisters also led noteworthy lives. His youngest brother Alfred authored the classic book The Fly-fisher's Entomology (1836) before migrating to Australia and their brother Hugh was one of the founders of the city of Albion in the American Midwest. His sisters married Samuel Carter – a railway solicitor and MP – and sugar-refiner Peter Martineau, the son of Peter Finch Martineau. Another sister Emily epitomised the family's interest in social reform through her collaborations with early socialists Robert Owen and Fanny Wright. Nurseryman Hugh Ronalds was his uncle, and his nephews included chemistry professor Edmund Ronalds, artist Hugh Carter, barrister John Corrie Carter and timber merchant and benefactor James Montgomrey. Thomas Field Gibson, a Royal Commissioner for the Great Exhibition of 1851, was one of his cousins. Early electrical science and engineering Ronalds was conducting electrical experiments by 1810: those on atmospheric electricity were outlined in George Singer's text Elements of Electricity and Electro-Chemistry (1814). He published his first papers in the Philosophical Magazine in 1814 on the properties of the dry pile, a form of battery that his mentor Jean-André Deluc helped to develop. The next year he described the first electric clock. Other inventions in this early period included an electrograph to record variations in atmospheric electricity through the day; an influence machine that generated electricity with minimal manual intervention; and new forms of electrical insulation, one of which was announced by Singer. He was also already creating what would become the renowned Ronalds Library of electrical books and managing his collection with perhaps the first practical card catalogue. His theoretical contributions included an early delineation of the parameters now known as electromotive force and current; an appreciation of the mechanism by which dry piles generated electricity; and the first description of the effects of induction in retarding electric signal transmission in insulated cables. =Electric telegraph= Ronalds' experiment with eight miles of iron wire Ronalds' most remembered work today is the electric telegraph he created at the age of 28. He established that electrical signals could be transmitted over large distances with eight miles of iron wire strung on insulators on his mother's lawn in Hammersmith. He found that the signal travelled immeasurably fast from one end to the other (but still believed the speed was finite). Foreshadowing both a future electrical age and mass communication, he wrote: Elements of the subterranean electric telegraph built by Francis Ronalds in 1816 > electricity, may actually be employed for a more practically useful purpose > than the gratification of the philosopher's inquisitive research… it may be > compelled to travel... many hundred miles beneath our feet... and... be > productive of... much public and private benefit... why... add to the > torments of absence those dilatory tormentors, pens, ink, paper, and posts? > Let us have electrical conversazione offices, communicating with each other > all over the kingdom... give me materiel enough, and I will electrify the > world. He complemented his vision with a working telegraph system built in and under his mother's garden at Hammersmith. It was infamously rejected on 5 August 1816 by Sir John Barrow, Secretary at the Admiralty, as being \\"wholly unnecessary\\". Commercialisation of the telegraph only began two decades later in the UK, led by William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone, who both had links to Ronalds' earlier work. Grand Tour The period 1818–20 was Ronalds' \\"Grand Tour\\" to Europe and the Near East. Embarking on his trip alone, he met up with numerous people along the way, including his friend Sir Frederick Henniker, archaeologist Giovanni Battista Belzoni, artist Giovanni Battista Lusieri, merchant Walter Stevenson Davidson, Revd George Waddington, Italian numismatist Giulio Cordero di San Quintino and Spanish geologist Carlos de Gimbernat. Ronalds' travel journal and sketches have been published on the web. On his return, he published his atmospheric electricity observations made in Palermo, Sicily, and near the erupting crater of Vesuvius. Mechanical design and manufacture Ronalds next focused on mechanical and civil engineering and design. Two surveying tools he designed and used to aid the production of survey plans were a modified surveyor's wheel that recorded distances travelled in graphical form and a double- reflecting sector to draw the angular separation of distant objects. He also invented a forerunner to the fire finder patented in 1915 to pinpoint the location of a fire and various accessories for the lathe. Some of these devices were manufactured for sale by toolmaker Holtzapffel. There is some evidence to suggest that he assisted Charles Holtzapffel in the early stages of preparing the Holtzapffel family's renowned treatise on turning. =Perspective machines and tripod stand= On 23 March 1825, he patented two drawing instruments for producing perspective sketches. The first produced a perspective view of an object directly from drawings of the plan and elevations. The second machine enabled a scene or person to be traced from life onto paper with considerable precision; he and Dr Alexander Blair used it to document the important Neolithic monuments at Carnac, France, with \\"almost photographic accuracy\\". He also created the ubiquitous portable tripod stand with three pairs of hinged legs to support his drawing board in the field. He manufactured these instruments himself and several hundred of them were sold. One of his first customers was mining engineer John Taylor. In 1840, he applied his understanding of perspective in developing more complex apparatus to aid the accurate depiction of cylindrical panoramas, which were a popular exhibition at that time. Kew Observatory Ronalds set up the Kew Observatory for the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1842 and he remained Honorary Director of the facility until late 1853. It was through the quality of his achievements there that Kew survived its early years and it went to become one of the most important meteorological and geomagnetic observatories in the world. This was despite ongoing efforts by George Airy, Director of the Greenwich Observatory, to undermine the work at Kew. =Continuously recording camera= The first successful camera for making continuous recordings of scientific instruments, built by Francis Ronalds in 1845. This example is an electrograph measuring atmospheric electricity Ronalds' most noteworthy innovation at Kew, in 1845, was the first successful camera to make continuous recordings of an instrument 24 hours per day. The British Prime Minister Lord John Russell gave him a financial award in recognition of the importance of the invention for observational science. He applied his technique in electrographs to observe atmospheric electricity, barographs and thermo-hygrographs to monitor the weather, and magnetographs to record the three components of geomagnetic force. The magnetographs were used by Edward Sabine in his global geomagnetic survey while the barograph and thermo-hygrograph were employed by the new Met Office to assist its first weather forecasts. Ronalds also supervised the manufacture of his instruments for other observatories around the world (the Radcliffe Observatory under Manuel John Johnson and the Colaba Observatory in India are two examples) and some continued in use until late in the 20th century. =Meteorological instruments and observations= Further instruments created at Kew included an improved version of Regnault's aspirated hygrometer that was employed for many years; an early meteorological kite; and the storm clock used to monitor rapid changes in meteorological parameters during extreme events. To observe atmospheric electricity, Ronalds created a sophisticated collecting apparatus with a suite of electrometers; the equipment was later manufactured and sold by London instrument-makers. A dataset of five years' duration was analysed and published by his observatory colleague William Radcliffe Birt. The phenomenon now known as geomagnetically induced current was observed on telegraph lines in 1848 during the first sunspot peak after the network began to take shape. Ronalds endeavoured to employ his atmospheric electricity equipment and magnetographs in a detailed study to understand the cause of the anomalies but had insufficient resources to complete his work. Last years Ronalds' final foreign sojourn in 1853–1862 was to northern Italy, Switzerland and France, where he assisted other observatories in building and installing his meteorological instruments and continued collecting books for his library. Some of his ideas documented in this period concerned electric lighting and a combined rudder and propeller for ships that was honed in the 20th century. He died at Battle, near Hastings, aged 85, and is buried in the cemetery there. The Ronalds Library was bequeathed to the newly formed Society of Telegraph Engineers (soon to become the Institution of Electrical Engineers and now the Institution of Engineering and Technology) and its accompanying bibliography was reprinted by Cambridge University Press in 2013. Ronalds had a very modest and retiring nature and did little to publicise his work through his life. During his last years, however, his key accomplishments became well known and revered in the scientific community, aided in particular by his friends Josiah Latimer Clark and Edward Sabine and his brother-in-law Samuel Carter. He was knighted at the age of 82. Colleagues at the Society of Telegraph Engineers regarded him as \\"the father of electric telegraphy\\", while his continuously recording camera was noted to be \\"of extreme importance to meteorologists and physicists, and… employed in all first-rate observatories\\". His portrait was painted by Hugh Carter. Commemorative plaques have been installed on two of his former homes and a road was named after him in Highbury.

Treatment generally requires immediate surgery.Stomach ulcer - Better Health Channel The ulcer is known initially as a peptic ulcer before the ulcer burns through the full thickness of the stomach or duodenal wall. A diagnosis is made by taking an erect abdominal/chest X-ray (seeking air under the diaphragm). This is in fact one of the very few occasions in modern times where surgery is undertaken to treat an ulcer. Many perforated ulcers have been attributed to the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. The incidence of perforated ulcer is steadily declining, though there are still incidents where it occurs. Causes include smoking, consuming highly acidic foods and beverages (such as coffee), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A perforated ulcer can be grouped into a stercoral perforation which involves a number of different things that causes perforation of the intestine wall. The first symptom of a perforated peptic ulcer is usually sudden, severe, sharp pain in the abdomen. The experience is typically so intense that most people precisely recall the exact moment the pain began. The pain is typically at its maximum immediately and persists. It is characteristically made worse by any movement, and greatly intensifies with coughing or sneezing.

It is distributed from Mexico and Belize to Brazil and westward into Bolivia. The wingspan is 75–86 mm. The upperside of the body and wings is green, often very bright. The underside of the body is whitish green. The forewing has three narrow antemedian lines. The postmedian line is well marked, straight, the basal edge is sharply delineated, the distal edge is diffuse and it is gradually lightening toward the outer margin. The remaining postmedian lines are poorly defined or absent. The oblique apical line is short. The oblique apical line on the forewing underside forms an angle with the irregularly undulate postmedian line, the marginal area bordered by these lines is as broad as in Xylophanes schausi. The green median band on the hindwing does not reach the costa. The distal margin is often green. There are probably at least two generations per year. In Costa Rica, adults have been recorded from November to February and again from April to July. In Brazil, adults have been recorded in September. The larvae feed on Faramea occidentalis and probably other Rubiaceae species. Early instars are green with yellow eyes, and feed solely on new leaves. They turn brown in the last instar and have a yellow eyespot.

Hoa Sen is a leading university in Vietnam; it is known for quality in education, training, and internationally recognized research for the community. It was one of the first private universities founded in Vietnam after this was legalized by the government. Its mission is \\"To contribute to the rapid, sustainable, and humane development of the Vietnamese and regional economy and society.\\" History The predecessor of Hoa Sen College was the School of Foreign Languages and Information Technology, which was established under the Decision 257/QĐ-UB dated August 12, 1991 by the Chairman of Ho Chi Minh City People Committee (the mayor). The school has been supported by Lotus Association in France. On October 11, 1994, the school was turned into a semi-private school. In 2001, the school inaugurated its second campus in Quang Trung Software Park, Ho Chi Minh City. In 2005, the school was officially upgraded to become Hoa Sen University. On November 30, 2006, the Vietnamese prime minister signed a decision to establish Hoa Sen University Decision to establish Hoa Sen University on the base of Hoa Sen College. One of the university's founding principles was a not-for-profit orientation that focused on reinvestment in education activities - one of the first and only educational institution to do so in Vietnam. On January 12, 2016, Hoa Sen University became the first university at Vietnam were accredited by ACBSP.  Controversy  In 2016, Hoa Sen University officially sought non-profit status, but was hindered by an ongoing conflict between the board of directors and shareholders who were against this not-for-profit orientation. A hostile takeover ensued, and although met with resistance from students who protested against the new for-profit direction, the board of directors was entirely replaced and administrative staff resistant to the takeover were purged.

Vaiyapuri Pillai (1891 – 17 February 1956) was a renowned scholar and Professor of Tamil. An advocate by profession, he edited and published several Tamil classics from original manuscripts. He is best remembered as the editor of the Tamil lexicon published by the Madras University in the 1920s. He was a voracious reader and had in his own private collection thousands of books in Tamil, English, Sanskrit and Malayalam. His collection also included hundreds of palm-leaf manuscripts. This collection was later donated to the National Library of India in Kolkata.  Controversies  In June 1940, the government of Madras State appointed a committee headed by V. S. Srinivasa Sastri to frame general principles for coining words for scientific and technical terms in Tamil. The constitution of the committee was opposed by Tamil purists who felt that Sastri was strongly anti-Tamil. Sastri precipitated matters further by recommending the inclusion of Vaiyapuri Pillai, who was also perceived to be anti-Tamil. The committee eventually recommended the retention of words of English and Sanskrit origin. Vaiyapuri justified the decision as a necessity for promoting national integration and cited the poetry of Manonmaniam Sundaram Pillai. The decisions of the committee were opposed tooth and nail by activists of the Madras Presidency Tamil Sangam and were eventually reversed after Sastri's death in 1946.  Literary works Nationalised In February 2009, the Tamil Nadu state government announced that the works of 28 scholars would be nationalised and the literary critic, Vaiyapuri Pillai's works were among them. In his budget address, finance minister K. Anbazhagan said compensation would be paid to the legal heirs of the authors having regard to the number of books written by them, their social impact and literary value. With a view to ensuring that the views and thoughts of great Tamil savants who dedicated their lives to the language benefitted the present and future generations, the government implemented the nationalization scheme.The Times of India: Literary works of 28 Tamil writers to be nationalised See also * Tamil Lexicon dictionary References External links * Category:Tamil writers Category:1891 births Category:1956 deaths ","title":"S.

The project was launched in 1999 with the objective of creating a web-based interface for all EU terminology resources so as to make the information more easily available and ensure its standardisation throughout the EU institutions. It has been used in the EU institutions and agencies since summer 2004. A public user interface was released for testing in early 2007 and was officially opened on 28 June 2007. A new version was released on 7 November 2018 following a full rebuild of the system with state-of-the-art technologies, the latest software development standards, best practices on usability and accessibility, and a new look and feel. IATE incorporated all of the existing terminology databases of the EU’s translation services into one interinstitutional database containing approximately 1.4 million multilingual entries. The following legacy databases were imported into IATE: *Eurodicautom (European Commission) *TIS (Council of the European Union) *Euterpe (European Parliament) *Euroterms (Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union) *CDCTERM (European Court of Auditors). IATE is intended to contain a single entry per concept, but actually contains multiple entries for many concepts. As these entries have been consolidated the number of entries has fallen, from approximately 1.4 million to less than 1 million, despite the addition of many new entries for new and previously unrecorded concepts. The project partners are the European Commission, European Parliament, Council of the European Union, European Court of Justice, European Court of Auditors, European Economic and Social Committee, European Committee of the Regions, European Central Bank, European Investment Bank, and the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union. The IATE web site is administered by the EU Translation Centre in Luxembourg on behalf of the project partners. The subject 'domains' are based on Eurovoc. The entire IATE glossary database can be downloaded for free in a zipped format, then multilanguage glossaries can be generated using a free tool.

In contrast to the Markov chain models, where each random variable in a sequence with a Markov property depends on a fixed number of random variables, in VOM models this number of conditioning random variables may vary based on the specific observed realization. This realization sequence is often called the context; therefore the VOM models are also called context trees. The flexibility in the number of conditioning random variables turns out to be of real advantage for many applications, such as statistical analysis, classification and prediction. Example Consider for example a sequence of random variables, each of which takes a value from the ternary alphabet {a, b, c}. Specifically, consider the string ' constructed from infinite concatenations of the sub-string '. The VOM model of maximal order 2 can approximate the above string using only the following five conditional probability components: {Pr(a  aa) = 0.5, Pr(b  aa) = 0.5, Pr(c  b) = 1.0, Pr(a  c)= 1.0, Pr(a  ca) = 1.0}. In this example, Pr(cab) = Pr(cb) = 1.0; therefore, the shorter context b is sufficient to determine the next character. Similarly, the VOM model of maximal order 3 can generate the string exactly using only five conditional probability components, which are all equal to 1.0. To construct the Markov chain of order 1 for the next character in that string, one must estimate the following 9 conditional probability components: {Pr(a  a), Pr(a  b), Pr(a  c), Pr(b  a), Pr(b  b), Pr(b  c), Pr(c  a), Pr(c  b), Pr(c  c)}. To construct the Markov chain of order 2 for the next character, one must estimate 27 conditional probability components: {Pr(a  aa), Pr(a  ab), ..., Pr(c  cc)}. And to construct the Markov chain of order three for the next character one must estimate the following 81 conditional probability components: {Pr(a  aaa), Pr(a  aab), ..., Pr(c  ccc)}. In practical settings there is seldom sufficient data to accurately estimate the exponentially increasing number of conditional probability components as the order of the Markov chain increases. The variable-order Markov model assumes that in realistic settings, there are certain realizations of states (represented by contexts) in which some past states are independent from the future states; accordingly, \\"a great reduction in the number of model parameters can be achieved.\\" Definition Let be a state space (finite alphabet) of size A. Consider a sequence with the Markov property x_1^{n}=x_1x_2\\\\dots x_n of realizations of random variables, where x_i\\\\in A is the state (symbol) at position \\\\scriptstyle (1 \\\\le i \\\\le n), and the concatenation of states x_i and x_{i+1} is denoted by x_ix_{i+1}. Given a training set of observed states, x_1^{n}, the construction algorithm of the VOM models learns a model that provides a probability assignment for each state in the sequence given its past (previously observed symbols) or future states. Specifically, the learner generates a conditional probability distribution P(x_i\\\\mid s) for a symbol x_i \\\\in A given a context s\\\\in A^*, where the * sign represents a sequence of states of any length, including the empty context. VOM models attempt to estimate conditional distributions of the form P(x_i\\\\mid s) where the context length s \\\\le D varies depending on the available statistics. In contrast, conventional Markov models attempt to estimate these conditional distributions by assuming a fixed contexts' length s = D and, hence, can be considered as special cases of the VOM models. Effectively, for a given training sequence, the VOM models are found to obtain better model parameterization than the fixed-order Markov models that leads to a better variance-bias tradeoff of the learned models. Application areas Various efficient algorithms have been devised for estimating the parameters of the VOM model. VOM models have been successfully applied to areas such as machine learning, information theory and bioinformatics, including specific applications such as coding and data compression, document compression, classification and identification of DNA and protein sequences, statistical process control, spam filtering, haplotypingBrowning, Sharon R. \\"Multilocus association mapping using variable-length Markov chains.\\" The American Journal of Human Genetics 78.6 (2006): 903–913. and others.

History The auditorium completes the group of buildings in Ibirapuera park, as designed originally by the architect in the 1950s.Fernando Serapião, Auditório completa conjunto edificado no parque Ibirapuera. PROJETODESIGN Edition 309, November 2005. Retrieved 24 April 2007. Compared to the original proposal it is lacking only the access square that would separate it from the Oca, which would serve as the main entrance to the park. At the 2008 Latin Grammy Awards the Brazilian Field awards were presented at the Ibirapuera Auditorium. In December of the same year, the Ibirapuera Auditorium was the host of the final fashion show of America's Next Top Model, Cycle 12. Architectural concept The front of the auditorium at night Interior of the auditorium. The building possesses volumetric simplicity, composed of a single block that in plan has the form of a trapezoid and, in section, the form of a triangle. As well as the other buildings in the park such as the Oca dome, and a great part of the architect's work, the auditorium is composed of reinforced concrete painted white. The unique form and spatial massing sets it apart from other auditoriums for concerts since the conception of the Paris Opera in the 19th century. It is composed of a separation of three parts, which makes a sequence of foyer, audience, stage from the exterior to the interior. The group formed by the auditorium together with the Oca, which is a semi-sphere, composing two buildings of pure and white geometrical volumes, is considered the most important of the project from an architectural point of view. The articulation of the group would be made complete by a great civic square, marquee, and footbridge, that have not been realized.Mônica Junqueira de Camargo. Sobre o projeto de Oscar Niemeyer para o entorno do Teatro no Parque Ibirapuera. Minha Cidade 125, March 2005. Retrieved 24 April 2007. A marquee, executed in red painted metal, covers the main access and gives identity to the building, characterizing it and differentiating it from other buildings. For this reason, the form and color of this element have transformed the branding of the auditorium and act as an architectural logo. It is called officially the Labareda - Portuguese for flame.

Cooper (born c. 1950) is a Canadian-American economist. Cooper is currently Chief Economist for Dominion Lending Centres. She was Executive Vice-President and Chief Economist of BMO Financial Group, with responsibilities for economic forecasting and risk assessment. She comments regularly in the press on financial issues.  Education and career  Cooper was born in Baltimore, Maryland. She earned a B.A. from Goucher College in 1972 and an M.A. and Ph.D from the University of Pittsburgh in 1976 and 1978, respectively. From 1977 to 1982 she worked as an economist for the Federal Reserve Board, after which she joined the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) as Director of Financial Economics. In 1983, accompanied by her (now divorced) husband and her son, Stefan Atkinson (b. 1980), Cooper moved to Toronto to accept a position with Burns Fry Limited; subsequently becoming a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. Burns Fry was merged into BMO Capital Markets in 1994. In 2006, Sherry was appointed to the position as Chief Economist of BMO Financial Group, which includes BMO Harris Bank in the United States. On December 10, 2012, it was announced that Sherry Cooper would be retiring on January 30 as BMO Chief Economist. Cooper is a member of the Economic Advisory Committee of the American Bankers Association, a group of twelve bank economists that meet to provide perspectives on the U.S. and global economies to the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and the executive branch. Cooper received the Lawrence Klein Award for U.S. forecasting accuracy in 2010. Cooper is now married to Toronto businessman Peter J. Cooper.  Press commentary  Cooper is best known for her often repeated prediction in the late 1990s that the devaluation of the Canadian dollar was an inexorable long-term trend, and that a Canada-U.S. currency union (which she describes as \\"dollarization\\") should be attempted immediately because the conversion rate would only be worse in future. After the Canadian dollar achieved parity with the U.S. dollar on September 20, 2007, Cooper conceded that \\"dollarization in the real world is political... Canadians do not want to lose an independent Bank of Canada, and the U.S. probably wouldn’t want to incorporate Canadian considerations in their deliberations,\\" but argued that a united currency would lead to a much simpler and more convenient world for North Americans. By July 2008, her mindset had changed on the matter and she stated in a note to institutional investors that, \\"The world may realize that it is no longer reasonable for the (US) dollar to be the anchor currency.\\" In a January 2013 interview on CBC Radio's The Current she made the statement that the financial crisis of 2008 would not have occurred \\"if the world had been full of female traders,\\" and attributes the mismanagement to testosterone. In the same interview she also suggested that the members of the financial sector who were responsible were equally harmed by the crisis as others, such as people who lost their homes.

Education and training Chase was born in St Louis, Missouri, on 12 March 1886. The fourth child of Grace (née Metcalfe) and Charles Denison Chase, he attended public elementary school and high school in St Louis. Despite a mathematical mind, he did not progress to college, instead working as an assistant in his father's laboratory at the Aluminum Company of America in Bauxite, Arkansas. His father was an Alcoa chemist noted among the pioneers of experimentation with the use of nitroglycerin in mining. In his early twenties he traveled to New York City to join his elder brother, Edward Leigh Chase, at the Art Students League, and later followed him again to ASL's Art League School of Landscape Painting at Woodstock, where he studied under L. Birge Harrison and John F. Carlson in 1909. The Chase brothers, both gifted artists, were early members of the Woodstock artist's colony, whose participants worked and lived in hand-made Catskill Mountain cabins as part of Ralph Whitehead's experiment with utopian living at Byrdcliffe, the Bohemian settlement nestled in the slopes above the town. Teacher and founder A decade later, in 1919, Chase was one of the founders of the Woodstock Artists' Association, along with Andrew Dasburg, Carl Eric Lindin, Henry Lee McFee, and his former teacher John Carlson. The following year he summered on Nantucket Island, where he established his first art school. From 1920 onward, Chase was the leading teacher of painting there for three decades. Dubbed \\"the dean of Nantucket artists\\" by the Artists Association of Nantucket, he was largely responsible for the development of that community as a true art colony. Among Chase's most important legacies were his students, including many who became renowned painters themselves: Elizabeth Saltonstall, Isabelle Hollister Tuttle, Ruth Haviland Sutton, Emily Hoffmeier and Anne Ramsdell Congdon. Chase encouraged open-air painting classes, weather permitting, otherwise utilizing wharf cottages along the waterfront, reminiscent of his own tutelage back in the mountain shanties of Woodstock. He helped to establish and nurture the Nantucket Artists Association, along with other influential local artists like Pat Gardner, Sybil Goldsmith, Philip Burnham Hicken, Edgar Jenney, C. Robert Perrin and Tony Sarg. Although based in Manhattan, Woodstock and Nantucket, Chase traveled around the United States. He spent a two-year stint in southern California during 1935 and 1936, painting the desert outside Palm Springs. In 1940, he founded the Sarasota School of Art at Longboat Key, Florida, where he taught periodically through 1952. Back in Woodstock, he taught and helped to promote such future notables as Harvey Fite, Anton Refregier and Marko Vukovic. Death Chase died at the Benedictine Hospital in Kingston, New York, on 3 July 1958. He is buried among other family members in the Artists Cemetery in Woodstock. Legacy Chase's paintings are heirs of the Northern Romantic tradition. Clearly influenced in his youth by American Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, he became more faithful to nature as his style matured, many of his later landscapes evoking a spiritual kinship with earlier Hudson River School masters like Albert Bierstadt, Thomas Cole and Frederic Edwin Church. His brother Edward Leigh Chase is the paternal grandfather of the actor Chevy Chase.

Phan Đình Phùng (; 1847January 21, 1896) was a Vietnamese revolutionary who led rebel armies against French colonial forces in Vietnam. He was the most prominent of the Confucian court scholars involved in anti-French military campaigns in the 19th century and was cited after his death by 20th-century nationalists as a national hero. He was renowned for his uncompromising will and principles—on one occasion,Marr, pp. 61-62. he refused to surrender even after the French had desecrated his ancestral tombs and had arrested and threatened to kill his family. Born into a family of mandarins from Hà Tĩnh Province, Phan continued his ancestors' traditions by placing first in the metropolitan imperial examinations in 1877. Phan quickly rose through the ranks under Emperor Tự Đức of the Nguyễn Dynasty, gaining a reputation for his integrity and uncompromising stance against corruption. Phan was appointed as the Imperial Censor, a position that allowed him to criticise his fellow mandarins and even the emperor. As the head of the censorate, Phan's investigations led to the removal of many incompetent or corrupt mandarins. Upon Tự Đức's death, Phan almost lost his life during a power struggle in the imperial court. The regent Tôn Thất Thuyết disregarded Tự Đức's will of succession, and three emperors were deposed and killed in just over a year. Phan protested against Thuyet's activities, was stripped of his honours and briefly jailed, before being exiled to his home province. At the time, France had just conquered Vietnam and made it a part of French Indochina. Along with Thuyet, Phan organised rebel armies as part of the Cần Vương movement, which sought to expel the French and install the boy Emperor Hàm Nghi at the head of an independent Vietnam. This campaign continued for three years until 1888, when the French captured Hàm Nghi and exiled him to Algeria. Phan and his military assistant Cao Thắng continued their guerrilla campaign, building a network of spies, bases and small weapons factories. However, Cao Thắng was killed in the process in late 1893. The decade-long campaign eventually wore Phan down, and he died from dysentery as the French surrounded his forces. Court official Phan was born in the village of Đông Thái in the northern central coast province of Hà Tĩnh. Đông Thái was famous for producing high-ranking mandarins and had been the home of senior imperial officials since the time of the Lê Dynasty. Twelve consecutive generations of the Phan family had been successful mandarinate graduates. All three of Phan's brothers who lived to adulthood passed the imperial examinations and became mandarins.Hodgkin, p. 117. Early on, Phan indicated his distaste for the classical curriculum required of an aspiring mandarin. He nevertheless persevered with his studies, passing the regional exams in 1876 and then topping the metropolitan exams the following year.Marr, p. 61. In his exam response, Phan cited Japan as an example of how an Asian country could make rapid military progress given sufficient willpower.Hodgkin, p. 116. Phan was never known for his scholarly abilities; it was his reputation for principled integrity that led to his quick rise through the ranks under the reign of Emperor Tự Đức. He was first appointed as a district mandarin in Ninh Bình Province, where he punished a Vietnamese Roman Catholic priest, who, with the tacit support of French missionaries, had harassed local non-Catholics. Amid the diplomatic controversy that followed, he avoided blaming the unpopular alliance between Vietnamese Catholics and the French on Catholicism itself, stating that the partnership had arisen out of the military and political vulnerabilities of Vietnam's imperial government. Despite this, the Huế court eventually removed Phan from this post. Phan was transferred to the Huế court as a member of the censorate, a watchdog body that monitored the work of the mandarinate. He earned the ire of many of his colleagues, but the trust of the emperor, by revealing that the vast majority of the court mandarins were making a mockery of a royal edict to engage in regular rifle practice. Tự Đức later dispatched Phan on an inspection trip to northern Vietnam. His report led to the ousting of many officials who were deemed corrupt or incompetent, including the viceroy of the northern region.Marr, p. 62. He rose to become the Ngu Su, or Imperial Censor, a position which allowed him to criticise other high officials and even the emperor for misconduct. Phan openly criticised Tôn Thất Thuyết, the foremost mandarin of the court, believing him to be rash and dishonest.Karnow, p. 121. Aside from his work in rooting out corruption, Phan also compiled a historical geography of Vietnam, which was published in 1883.Goscha, p. 24. Despite his prominent position in the Nguyễn Dynasty, little is known about Phan's personal stance on Vietnamese relations with France, which was in the process of colonising Vietnam. France had first invaded in 1858,McLeod, p. 43. beginning the colonisation of southern Vietnam.McLeod, pp. 44-45. Three provinces were ceded under the 1862 Treaty of Saigon,McLeod, p. 54.Karnow, p. 119. and a further three in 1867 to form the colony of Cochinchina.McLeod, p. 55.Karnow, p. 90. During the period, there was debate in the Huế court on the best strategy to regain the territory. One group advocated military means, while another believed in the use of diplomacy in addition to financial and religious concessions.McLeod, pp. 51-53. By the time of Tự Đức's death in 1883, the whole of Vietnam was colonised, henceforth incorporated with Laos and Cambodia into French Indochina.Marr, p. 55.Karnow, p. 98. Upon his death in 1883, the childless Tự Đức had named his nephew, Kiến Phúc, as his successor, rather than Dục Đức, his most senior heir. Tự Đức had written in his will that Dục Đức was depraved and unworthy of ruling the country.Chapuis, p. 15. However, led by Thuyet, the regents enthroned Dục Đức under the pressure of the ladies of the court. Phan protested against the violation of Tự Đức's will of succession and refused to sanction anyone other than Kien Phuc. Lucky to escape the death penalty, Phan was stripped of his positions. Later, Dục Đức was deposed and executed by Thuyet on the grounds of ignoring court etiquette, ignoring the mourning rites for Tự Đức and having affairs with the late emperor's consorts. Phan again protested the regents' actions and was briefly imprisoned by Thuyet, before being exiled to his home province. Revolutionary career = Cần Vương = Phan rallied to the cause of the boy Emperor Hàm Nghi--the fourth monarch in little over a year-- after an abortive royal uprising at Huế in 1885.Chapuis, pp. 15-18. Thuyet and fellow regent Nguyễn Văn Tường had enthroned Hiệp Hòa after disposing of Dục Đức. However, the new emperor was wary of the regents' behaviour and attempted to avoid their influence, leading Thuyet to organise his execution.Chapuis, p. 16. The teenage Kiến Phúc ascended the throne, but was poisoned by his adoptive mother Học Phi--one of Tự Đức's wives--whom he caught having intercourse with Tuong.Chapuis, p. 17. Kien Phuc was thus replaced by his 14-year-old brother Hàm Nghi. In the meantime, the French concluded that the regents were causing too much trouble and had to be disposed of. Thuyet had already decided to place Hàm Nghi at the head of the Phong Trào Cần Vuơng (Loyalty to the Emperor Movement), which sought to end French rule with a royalist rebellion. Phan helped the cause by setting up bases in Hà Tĩnh and creating his own guerrilla army. Thuyet had hoped to secure support from the Qing Dynasty of China,Chapuis, p. 21. but Phan thought that Vietnam's best chance of effective support came from Siam. Gia Long, the founder of the Nguyễn Dynasty and great-grandfather of Tự Đức, had married his sister off to the King of Siam. He had also used Siam as a base-in-exile during his quest for the throne in the 1780s. However, direct appeals to the Siamese government only yielded a few pack trains of firearms and ammunition. In preparation for the revolt, Thuyet had been building up an armed base at Tan So for over a year.Chapuis, p. 20. In any case, the Cần Vương revolt started on July 5, 1885 when Thuyet launched a surprise attack against the colonial forces after a diplomatic confrontation with the French.Marr, p. 47.Karnow, p. 99.Chapuis, p. 19. Thuyet took Hàm Nghi northwards to the Tan So mountain base near the border with Laos after the attack failed. The campaign was launched when the emperor issued the Can Vuong edict that had been prepared by the regent.Marr, p. 43. Phan initially rallied support from his native village and set up his headquarters on Mount Vũ Quang, which overlooked the coastal French fortress at Hà Tĩnh. Phan's organisation became a model for future insurgents. For flexibility, he divided his operational zone into twelve districts. His forces upheld military discipline and wore uniforms.Chapuis, p. 93. Phan initially used the local scholar-gentry as his military commanders. Their first notable attack targeted two nearby Catholic villages that had collaborated with French forces. Colonial troops arrived a few hours later, quickly overwhelming the rebels and forcing them to retreat to their home village, where the retribution was heavy. Phan managed to escape but his elder brother was captured by the same former viceroy of northern Vietnam who had been removed from office as a result of Phan's critical report. The disgraced official was now a French collaborator, serving as the governor of Nghệ An Province. The strategy of attempting to pressure Phan into capitulating was a classical strategy of coercion. The French used an old friend and fellow villager to make an emotional and deeply Confucian appeal for Phan to surrender in order to save his brother, his ancestral tombs and his entire village. Phan was reported to have replied: Phan was later reported to have simply retorted, \\"If anyone carves up my brother, remember to send me some of the soup\\". However, he held no illusions about the prospect of successfully driving out the French, stating \\"It is our destiny. We accept it.\\" This incident and Phan's response are often cited as one of the reasons why he was so admired by the populace and among future generations of Vietnamese anti-colonialists: he adhered to the highest personal standards of patriotism. He identified with a countrywide cause, far removed from the questions of family and region. Phan's men were well-trained and disciplined, and the military inspiration behind his rebellion was derived from Cao Thang, a bandit leader who had been protected from royal forces by Phan's brother a decade earlier. They operated in the provinces of Thanh Hóa in the north, Hà Tĩnh, Nghệ An in the centre and Quảng Bình in the south, with their strongest areas being the two central provinces. In 1887, Phan concluded that his tactics were misguided, ordering his subordinates to cease open combat and resort to guerrilla tactics. His men built up a network of base camps, food caches, intelligence agents and peasant supply contacts. Phan traveled to the north in the hope of coordinating strategic and tactical plans with other leaders. In the meantime, Cao Thang led a force of around 1,000 men with some 500 firearms between them. Cao Thang produced around 300 rifles by disassembling and copying 1874-model French weapons that had been captured.Goscha, p. 25. For the purpose of creating such replica guns, they captured Vietnamese artisans. According to French officers who later captured some of the Vietnamese copies, the weapons were proficiently reproduced. The only details in which they were regarded as being defective were in the tempering of the springs, which were improvised with umbrella spokes, and the lack of rifling in the barrels, which curtailed range and accuracy.Marr, p. 64. Nevertheless, the weaponry used by Phan's rebels was far inferior to that of their adversaries, and their inland positions were within firing range of the French Navy. The Vietnamese could not rely on China to give them material support, and other European powers such as Portugal, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were unwilling to sell them weapons for various reasons. Thus, Phan had to explore overland routes to procure weapons from Siamese sources--using seafaring transport was impossible due to the presence of the French Navy. He instructed his followers to create a secret route from Hà Tĩnh through Laos into northeastern Siam; one such route from Mount Vu Quang was believed to have been created around 1888. It is unclear if Phan himself went to Thailand, but a young female supporter named Co Tam was his designated arms buyer in Tha Uthen, which boasted a substantial expatriate Vietnamese community. In 1890, the Siamese Army transported around 1,000 Austrian repeating-rifles from Bangkok to Luang Prabang in Laos. However, it is unclear whether the weapons found their way into Vietnamese hands or whether they were related to Co Tam's activities. =After Cần Vương= In 1888, Hàm Nghi's Muong bodyguard Truong Quang Ngoc betrayed him,Chapuis, p. 62. leading to the emperor's capture and deportation to Algeria.Marr, p. 57.Karnow, p. 100. Phan and Cao Thang fought on in the mountainous areas of Hà Tĩnh, Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa. Another 15 bases were built along the mountain to complement the headquarters at Vu Quang. Each base had a subordinate commander leading units numbering between 100 and 500 men. The operations were funded by local villagers, who were levied with a land tax in silver and rice. Local bases were supported by nearby villages and excess funds were sent to Vu Quang. Phan's men foraged and sold cinnamon bark to raise funds, while lowland peasants donated spare metals for the production of weapons. When Phan returned from the north in 1889, his first order was to track down Hàm Nghi's betrayer Ngoc. When he was found, Phan personally executed Ngoc in Tuyên Hóa. He then began a series of small-unit attacks on French installations through the summer of 1890, but these proved indecisive. The French relied mostly on district and provincial colonial units to man their perpetually increasing line of forts, which were usually commanded by a French lieutenant. In late 1890, a French effort to move into the low-lying villages and isolate the populace from the mountainous rebel bases failed. In the spring of 1892, a major French sweep of Hà Tĩnh failed, and in August, Cao Thang seized the initiative with a bold counterattack on the provincial capital. The rebels broke into the prison and freed their compatriots, killing a large number of the Vietnamese soldiers who defended the penitentiary as members of the French colonial forces. This caused the French to intensify their efforts against Phan, and a counteroffensive was conducted throughout the remainder of 1892, forcing the rebels to retreat back into the mountains. Two of their bases fell and steady French pressure began to break their covert resistance links with lowland villages. This compounded the problems of securing food, supplies, intelligence data and recruits. A ring of French forts continued to be erected, increasingly pinning down Phan's men. The only notable gain for Phan's forces during this period was the acquisition of gunpowder supplies from Siam. This enabled them to mix foreign and local powder in a 50:50 ratio, rather than their previous weaker mixture of 20:80.Marr, pp. 64-65. Late in the year, the burden on Phan increased after the loss of two Can Vuong allies. In September, Tong Duy Tân--who led the royalists in Thanh Hóa-- was captured and publicly executed.Marr, pp. 60-61. Nguyen Thien Thuat, who had been active in the northern provinces of Hưng Yên and Hải Dương, fled to Guangxi in China. The supporters of Tan and Tuat moved south and integrated into Phan's force. In mid-1893, Cao Thang proposed a full-scale attack on the provincial seat of Nghệ An and the surrounding posts. The plan proposed to Phan included diversions to the south and the training of almost 2,000 men in conventional military tactics. Unconvinced of its viability, Phan reluctantly approved the plan. The troops were eager, but after overpowering several small posts en route, the main force was pinned down while attacking the French fort of No on September 9, 1893. Along with his brother, Cao Thang was mortally wounded while leading a risky frontal attack with 150 men, and the forces retreated in disarray. Phan regarded the loss of Cao Thang as a significant one, admitting as much in delivering the eulogy and funeral oration.Marr, p. 65. According to the historian David Marr, there was evidence that Phan clearly realised the advantages and limitations of prolonged resistance. Although Phan had previously stated that he was not expecting ultimate success, the guerrilla leader thought that it was important to keep pressuring the French in order to demonstrate to the populace that there was an alternative to what he felt was a defeatist attitude from the Huế court.Marr, p. 66. =Downfall= alt=Aged man with cylindrical headdress, long flowing beard and moustache, a traditional Vietnamese tunic, darkly coloured with a light circular and Chinese character imprints, light coloured trousers, and dark shoes, sitting in a chair. Hoàng Cao Khải, the French-installed viceroy of Tonkin, perceived Phan's intent to a degree that his French masters did not. Khai was from a scholar-gentry family from the same village as Phan.Hodgkin, p. 113. He became the main backer of a determined effort to crush Phan's forces, using every means available: political, psychological and economic. By late 1894, relatives and suspected sympathisers of the insurgents were intimidated and more resistance commanders had been killed. Communications were disrupted, and the rebel hideouts became increasingly insecure. In an attempt to force Phan to surrender, the French arrested his family and desecrated the tombs of his ancestors, publicly displaying the remains in Hà Tĩnh. Khai delivered a message to Phan via a relative. Phan sent a written reply, allowing their exchange to be studied. Khai recalled the common origins of the pair and promised Phan that he would lobby Governor-General Jean Marie Antoine de Lanessan and other French officials for an amnesty in return for Phan's surrender.Lam, p. 123. Khai credited Phan with righteousness, loyalty and dedication towards the monarchy. According to Marr, \\"Phan Dinh Phung's reply was a classic in savage understatement, utilizing standard formalism in the interest of propaganda, with deft denigration of his opponent\\". Phan appealed to Vietnamese nationalist sentiment, recalling his country's stubborn resistance to Chinese aggression. He cited defensive wars against the Han, Tang, Song, Yuan and Ming dynasties, asking why a country \\"a thousand times more powerful\\" could not annex Vietnam.Lam, p. 125. Phan concluded that it was \\"because the destiny of our country has been willed by Heaven itself\\". Phan placed the responsibility for the suffering of the people at the feet of the French, who \\"acted like a storm\\".Lam, pp. 126-127. After analysing his own actions, Phan concluded with a thinly veiled attack on Khai and his collaborators. Khai's appeal was rebutted with an appeal to history, nationalist sentiment and a demand that the blame for death and destruction lay with the colonial forces and their Vietnamese assistants. Phan raised the stakes above family and village to the entire nation and its populace.Marr, p. 68. With Phan's rebuke in his hands, Khai translated both documents into French and presented them to de Lanessan, proposing that it was time for the final \\"destruction of this scholar gentry rebellion\\". In July 1895, French area commanders called in 3,000 troops to tighten the cordon around the three remaining rebel bases. The insurgents were able to execute ambushes at night, but Phan contracted dysentery and had to be carried on a stretcher whenever his unit moved. A collaborator mandarin named Nguyen Than, who had previous experience in pacification in Quảng Ngãi and Quảng Nam, was drafted in to isolate the insurgents from their supporters in the villages. Cut off from their supplies, the insurgents were left to survive by eating roots and occasional handfuls of dried corn. Their shoes were worn through and most were without blankets. Phan died of dysentery on January 21, 1896, and his captured followers were executed. A report submitted by the de Lanessan to the Minister of Colonies in Paris stated that \\"the soul of resistance to the protectorate was gone\\".

Ngô Đình Khả, a Catholic mandarin and father of Ngo Dinh Diem--the first President of South Vietnam-- was a member of the French colonial administration. Kha had Phan's tomb exhumed and used the remains in gunpowder used for executing revolutionaries. Phan is widely regarded by Vietnamese people as a revolutionary hero. Phan Bội Châu, regarded as the leading Vietnamese anti-colonial figure of the early 20th century, strongly praised Phan in his writing, with particular emphasis on his defiance of Khai.Marr, p. 117. During Phan Boi Chau's career as a teacher, he strongly emphasised Phan's deeds to his students.Marr, p. 85. In 1941, after returning to Vietnam after decades in exile, the Marxist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, then using the name Nguyen Ai Quoc (Nguyen the Patriot), invoked the memory of Phan in appealing to the public for support for his independence movement.Duiker, p. 252. Like Phan, Ho was a native of Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh.Duiker, p. 13. In the 1940s, Ho's Vietminh named their self-produced style of grenades in honour of Phan.Karnow, p. 173. Since then, Ho's communists have portrayed themselves as the modern day incarnations of revered nationalist leaders such as Phan, Trương Định and Emperors Lê Lợi and Quang Trung, who expelled Chinese forces from Vietnam.McLeod, p. 51.Li, p. 13. Both North and South Vietnam had prominent thoroughfares in their capital cities (Hanoi and Saigon, respectively) named in Phan's honour.

It was designed by the Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio in 1552 and is illustrated and described by him in Book Two of his 1570 masterwork, I quattro libri dell'architettura (The Four Books on Architecture).Andrea Palladio, The Four Books on Architecture, translated by Robert Tavernor and Richard Schofield (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2002) bk. 2, . Architecture Villa Cornaro was mainly constructed in 1553–1554, with additional work into the 1590s, after Palladio had died, for Giorgio Cornaro, younger son of a wealthy family.Douglas Lewis, \\"Freemasonic Imagery in a Venetian Fresco Cycle,\\" in Hermeticism and the Renaissance, edited by Ingrid Merkel and Allen G. Debus(Washington, D. C.: Folger Shakespeare Library, 1988), p. 366, . It represents one of the most exemplary illustrations of a Renaissance villa during this time frame. The north façade has an innovative projecting central portico-loggia that is a flexible living space out of the sun and open to cooling breezes. The interior space is a harmonious arrangement of the strictly symmetrical floor plans on which Palladio insisted without exception. Rooms of inter-related proportions composed of squares and rectangles flank a central axial vista, which extends through the house. As Rudolf Wittkower noted,Wittkower, Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism (London: Tiranti) 1962:72. by moving subsidiary staircases into the projecting wings and filling matching corner spaces with paired oval principal stairs, space was left for a central salone, which is fully as wide as the porticos. The central core of the villa forms a rectangle in which there are six repetitions of an elegant standard module. The interior has 18th-century frescos by Mattia Bortoloni and stuccos by Camillo Mariani. Influence Through its illustration in Palladio's I quattro libri dell'architettura, in the 18th century Villa Cornaro became a model for villas all over the world, particularly in England Marble Hill House (1724–29) in Twickenham, Middlesex, and in colonial America Drayton Hall (1738–1742) in Charleston, South Carolina, and Thomas Jefferson's initial version of Monticello (1768–1770) are early examples of its influence. Conservation Richard Rush purchased the Villa Cornaro in 1969 from an organization of the Italian Government dedicated to preserving the national monuments of Italy in the Veneto (L'Ente per le Ville Venete). He and his wife, Julia, restored the villa and furnished it with antiques over a period of twenty years. Since 1996 the villa has been conserved as part of a World Heritage Site \\"City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto\\". The villa is owned by Carl and Sally Gable, of Atlanta, Georgia, who purchased it in 1989 for $2 million from Dr. Rush. In 2017, the couple put up the villa for sale; the asking price was 35 million British pounds.Sally Gable and Carl I.

It is written in the Python programming language using the Django framework and is free software originally developed and released by Translate.org.zaTranslate.org.za in 2004. It was further developed as part of the WordForge project and the African Network for Localisation and is now maintained by Translate.org.za. Pootle is a software platform for localization of applications' graphical user interfaces, as opposed to document translation. Pootle makes use of the Translate Toolkit for manipulating translation files and offline features used to manage the translation of LibreOffice and Gajim in Pootle. Pootle has built-in terminology extraction, translation memory, glossary management and matching, goal creation, and management of users. In the translation process, it can display statistics for the body of translations hosted by the server and allow users to make translation suggestions and corrections for later review. It acts as a translation-specific bug reporting system, allowing online translation with various translators, operating as a management system where translators translate using an offline tool and use Pootle to manage the workflow of the translation.  History  Pootle was first developed by David Fraser while working for Translate.org.za in a project funded by the CATIA programme. Its first official release was made in December 2004 although it had been used in various internal Translate@thons by Translate.org.za. The name Pootle is an acronym for PO-based Online Translation / Localization Engine, but it is also a character in the BBC children's program The Flumps. Translate.org.za released various versions and in 2006 Pootle was further developed as part of the WordForge project, a project funded by the Open Society Institute and the International Development Research Centre.

Two Viet Cong operatives detonated a car bomb underneath the hotel, which housed United States Army officers. The explosion killed two Americans, an officer and an NCO, and injured approximately 60, including military personnel and Vietnamese civilians. The Viet Cong commanders had planned the venture with two objectives in mind. First, by attacking an American installation in the center of the heavily guarded capital, the Viet Cong intended to demonstrate their ability to strike in South Vietnam should the United States decide to launch air raids against North Vietnam. Second, the bombing would demonstrate to the South Vietnamese that the Americans were vulnerable and could not be relied upon for protection.Karnow, p. 423.Langguth, pp. 326–327. The bombing prompted debate within the administration of United States President Lyndon B. Johnson. Most of his advisers favored retaliatory bombing of North Vietnam and the introduction of American combat troops, while Johnson preferred the existing strategy of training the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to protect South Vietnam from the Vietcong. In the end, Johnson decided not to take retaliatory action.  Background and planning  Brink BOQ, Saigon, South Vietnam Following World War II, the communist-dominated Vietminh fought the French colonial forces in an attempt to gain Vietnamese independence. After the French defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, Vietnam was partitioned at the 17th parallel, pending national reunification elections in 1956.Jacobs, pp. 40–56.Karnow, pp. 210–214. The elections were canceled, resulting in the long-term existence of communist North Vietnam and anti-communist South Vietnam as separate states. In the late-1950s, South Vietnamese guerrillas known as the Viet Cong—covertly supported by North Vietnam—began an insurgency with the aim of forcefully reunifying the country under communist rule.Jacobs, pp. 90–100. With the Cold War at its height, the United States—the main backer of South VietnamJacobs, pp. 102–104.—sent military advisers into the country to help train and guide the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in their fight against the Vietcong. By 1964, there were 23,000 American military personnel in the country. The communists viewed the Americans as colonizers and the South Vietnamese as their puppets, and attacked both with force. Urban attacks on American personnel began in February 1963, with a bombing at a dining venue that killed one and wounded three. During that month, there were three more attacks on Americans in dining or entertainment venues, killing a total of 6 and injuring 68, leading to systematic security measures being put in place in Saigon to protect off-duty Americans. The bombing was planned and performed by two Vietcong agents who escaped uninjured and were never captured. Nguyen Thanh Xuan recollected his involvement to historian Stanley Karnow after the war had ended. In late-November, Xuan and his comrade received orders from a Vietcong intermediary to bomb the Brinks Hotel. The building housed United States Army officers, including lieutenant colonels and majors, and attracted off-duty personnel with its highly regarded food and drink, rooftop seating areas and movie screenings. It also hosted a few officers who were members of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. The building was named after Brigadier General Francis. G. Brink, who had served as the first commander of MAAG Indochina during the First Indochina War and had been used by American personnel for about four years. A rooftop dinner had been planned for Christmas Eve. According to the historian Mark Moyar, it was a six-story building and had 193 bedrooms, although The New York Times reported that the building had eight stories and had 60 bedrooms that housed two people each. The building was L-shaped. The building was surrounded by a 4.5 m concrete wall, which provided a buffer zone of 15 m from the wall of the actual hotel. The buffer zone was used as a carpark and the streets adjoining the hotel were heavily-lit and guarded by Vietnamese personnel at all times. However, the sentries had a reputation for being lax patrollers, as US journalists often entered the compound late in the evenings without being checked. The Vietcong duo observed their target over the next month, mixing with the crowds in the busy street outside. Noting that South Vietnamese officers mingled freely with Americans, they obtained ARVN uniforms from Saigon's black market, enabling them to get closer. Xuan disguised himself as a military chauffeur, while his partner dressed as a South Vietnamese major. They mingled with the real officers so that they could copy their mannerisms, speaking style and even their way of smoking. The Vietcong pair then procured the two cars and explosives needed for the operation. The Vietcong commanders had planned the venture with two aims in mind. Firstly, by attacking an American institution in the heart of the heavily guarded capital, the bombing would demonstrate the Vietcong's ability to strike against the Americans in Vietnam, should the United States decide to launch air raids against North Vietnam. Secondly, the attack would demonstrate to the South Vietnamese public that the Americans were vulnerable and could not be relied upon for protection. Xuan added that \\"all the crimes committed by the Americans were directed from this nerve center\\". In the month leading up to the attack, South Vietnamese military intelligence had seized communist documents indicating a strategy of attacking US military targets in urban areas during the Christmas period in order to lower the morale of the US public and therefore turn opinion against intervention in Vietnam. He recalled that the number of American officers at the Brinks Hotel had swelled on Christmas Eve because they were using the building to coordinate their celebrations, and that the attack would therefore cause more casualties than on a normal day.  Explosion  The bombers stashed explosives weighing approximately in the trunk of one of the cars, and set a timing device to trigger the bomb at 17:45, during the happy hour in the officers' bar at the hotel. The pair drove their vehicles into the hotel's grounds. Knowing from their intelligence that a certain American colonel had returned to the US, the \\"major\\" lied and told the hotel clerk that he had an appointment with the American officer, claiming that the colonel would be coming from Da Lat. The clerk correctly replied that the colonel had left the country, but the \\"major\\" insisted that the clerk was mistaken. The \\"major\\" then parked his vehicle in the car park beneath the hotel, before ordering his chauffeur to leave and fetch the American with the other vehicle. He then left the hotel grounds, asking the guard to tell the American colonel to wait for him. The \\"major\\" claimed that he had not eaten all day and was going to a nearby café. While the \\"major\\" was at the eatery, the bomb detonated, killing two American officers. The first and highest-ranking officer killed was Lieutenant Colonel James Robert Hagen, who had served in the army for 20 years and was working for the MACV. Hagen was found dead amid the rubble two hours after the blast. The second victim was David M. Agnew, a civilian employee of the Navy Department who attended to real estate matters. The injury reports are conflicting. Karnow reported that 58 people (military and civilian) were injured, Mark Moyar reported that 38 American officers were wounded along with 25 Vietnamese civilians, who worked inside the building, while journalist A. J. Langguth reported that 10 Americans and 43 Vietnamese were injured. A report in The New York Times the day after the attack reported 98 injuries, including 61 US military personnel, 2 US civilians, 34 Vietnamese and an Australian serviceman. Many of the US officers were still on their way back to the Brinks and arrived a few minutes after the blast occurred; there would have been more casualties if the explosion had occurred later. Most of the injured suffered from lacerations or concussions and were not badly hurt, as all but 20 were released from hospital within five hours and those who remained did not suffer life-threatening injuries. However, many mid-level officers, including lieutenant colonels and majors, were injured, but after one day in hospital, only seven lieutenant colonels, one major and three captains were yet to be discharged. Apart from the steel girders, which supported the building, the explosion completely destroyed the ground floor. The bottom four floors were all punctured by the blast and sustained significant damage. The damage was accentuated because several trucks were in the underground car park, with gas canisters ready for delivery. As a result, the explosion detonated the gas, creating a fireball,Moyar, p. 347. which took 40 minutes to extinguish. Multiple vehicles were crushed or destroyed by fire, and one vehicle's engine was blown away by the explosion before crashing into a wall. Overall, the damage was sufficient that to render the building uninhabitable pending a major repair, and all those who were billeted there had to be moved to private dwellings or other mass accommodation. The debris caused by the bombing damaged nearby buildings, including the living quarters for enlisted men, located across the street, as well as Saigon's two leading hotels, the Caravelle and the Intercontinental. The force of the explosion also shattered windows at the United States Information Service two blocks away and in shopfronts on the main shopping promenade Rue Catinat. The blast destroyed the studios of the Armed Forces Radio Service, which were located on the ground floor of the hotel, but the station returned to the airwaves two hours later, using an emergency transmitter. The explosion forced the US to fly in more bomb-detection equipment, as most of the devices already in Vietnam were stored inside the hotel and were destroyed in the attack. At the time, American entertainers, including Bob Hope, were in Saigon to perform for US personnel. It is unclear whether Hope was a target; Moyar reported that Hope was targeted, but was delayed at the airport due to a luggage mishap, while Lawrence J. Quirk reported that the comedian and his troupe were staying in a hotel across the street and were not in range of the blast.  Reaction  alt=Middle-aged man with greying dark hair parted slightly off-centre. He wears a green dress uniform, with suit and tie, is clean-shaven, and has four stars on his shoulder to indicate his rank. The attack surprised American officials and policymakers on Vietnam, who were confident that the South Vietnamese government was in control in Saigon and that the Vietcong were only a threat in rural areas. The South Vietnamese government was unstable, as it was the latest in a series of military juntas that had ruled for brief periods before being deposed. The infighting exasperated Maxwell Taylor, the US ambassador to South Vietnam and former Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who felt that the disputes between the junta's senior officers were derailing the war effort. Less than two weeks before the bombing, the generals had dissolved the High National Council, a civilian advisory body, prompting Taylor to summon the generals to his office. The ambassador then angrily denounced the generals, and the next day advised General Nguyen Khanh, the president, to resign and go into exile, as he had lost Taylor's confidence.Moyar, pp. 344–345.Langguth, pp. 322–325. Khanh threatened to expel Taylor, who said that his forced departure would mean the end of US support for South Vietnam.Karnow, p. 399. On December 22, Khanh announced on Radio Vietnam that \\"We make sacrifices for the country's independence and the Vietnamese people's liberty, but not to carry out the policy of any foreign country\\".Moyar, p. 346. Khanh explicitly denounced Taylor in an interview published in the New York Herald Tribune on December 23, and on the day of the bombing, he issued a declaration of independence from \\"foreign manipulation\\". At the time, Khanh was also secretly negotiating with the communists, hoping to put together a peace deal so he could expel the Americans from Vietnam. As a result, there was a suspicion among a minority that Khanh and his officers had been behind the attack, even though the Vietcong had claimed responsibility through a radio broadcast.Moyar, p. 348. The Americans responded to the ground-level situation by organizing urgent security meetings with Saigon officials with a view to increasing safety standards. This led to an increase in military patrols around all US military accommodation in Saigon, which were also exhaustively searched for explosives. An additional 65 US Navy personnel were deployed for this purpose and, passers-by in the streets were stopped and checked for weapons. General William Westmoreland, who was the U.S. Army commander in South Vietnam, Taylor, and other senior U.S. officers in Saigon and Washington, D.C. urged President Lyndon B. Johnson to authorize reprisal bombings against North Vietnam. Taylor messaged Washington on Christmas Day, saying, \\"Hanoi will get the word that, despite our present tribulations, there is still bite in the tiger they call paper, and the U.S. stock in this part of the world will take sharp rise. Some of our local squabbles will probably disappear in enthusiasm which our action would generate.\\" Taylor recommended that the US take unilateral action, citing the animosity between himself and Khanh's junta. Johnson called his U.S.-based advisers to his Texas ranch for discussions on Christmas Day. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara advised Johnson to reject Taylor's proposal. Johnson declined to act, stating that an escalation during the Christmas period would be inappropriate, as it would damage public morale. He also noted that because of the political instability in Saigon, the international community and the American public were unlikely to believe that the Vietcong were behind the attack, feeling that they would instead blame local infighting for the bombing. This was despite the fact that the Vietcong had already claimed responsibility. Johnson administration officials concluded four days after the bombing that the Vietcong were responsible. Johnson believed that it was too late to retaliate and that any action taken more than 36 hours after the event constituted unprovoked aggression. The State Department cabled Taylor and the embassy, saying that \\"In view of the overall confusion in Saigon\\", public U.S. and international opinion towards an American air strike would be that the Johnson administration was \\"trying to shoot its way out of an internal [South Vietnamese] political crisis\\". Johnson said to Taylor that \\"Every time I get a military recommendation it seems to me that it calls for large-scale bombing. I have never felt that this war will be won from the air.\\" At the time, Johnson was reluctant to accede to his officials' calls for large-scale bombing of North Vietnam, a strategy that eventually became policy. In January 1965, the Vietcong secretly held their 3rd Conference in South Vietnam and concluded that in failing to retaliate, \\"the Americans lacked the will to strike North Vietnam or shield South Vietnam from the mortal blow\\".Moyar, p. 485. At the time, North Vietnam vigorously denied ever sending troops or equipment into South Vietnam. In reality, both sides violated the 1954 Geneva Accords by covertly infiltrating the other's borders to carry out hostile military activity.Karnow, pp. 346–347, 378–379. Meanwhile, South Vietnam's government had imposed media censorship in November 1964 and closed ten newspapers for sympathizing with the communists.Moyar, p. 334. The attack fomented feelings of insecurity among American policymakers about communist attacks. Johnson hoped that the continuing presence of American military advisers would be sufficient to strengthen the ARVN so that it could stabilize the Saigon government, but many of his defense department advisers felt that American combat troops were needed on the ground. This increased the tension between the president's civilian and military officials, before the Americans became directly involved in fighting in 1965. David Tucker of the United States Army War College said that the bombing was \\"insignificant for the conventional military balance but important for the political struggle that was the primary focus of the enemy [Vietcong]\\". The facility was repaired and American officers continued to stay there until the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, when the communists overran South Vietnam and reunified the country under their rule.

That same year he established the Young Men Mohammedan Association at Lahore. Two years later, he read out at the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference, a learned and thoughtful paper on “The Education of Musalmans in the Punjab”. This paper impressed Syed Ahmad Khan so much that Shah Din was chosen, at the early age of twenty-six, to preside over the next session of the All-India Mohammedan Educational Conference in 1894.Book Title: Justice Shah Din, by Bashir Ahmad (1962).

Under the Minto-Morley Reforms, he was appointed along with Mian Mohammad Shafi, Umar Hayat Tiwana and Chaudhary Shahab-ud-din to the Punjab Council. These western educated leaders, drawn from the Muslim middle and upper classes, were marked by their progressive and liberal views. His appointment as a judge would however curtail his political ambitions and he resigned as president of the Punjabi branch of the All-India Muslim League. He nonetheless retained his passion for educational work and in 1913 he presided over the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference for a second time.S.M.

Production and airings Dino Babies first aired on the BBC in the United Kingdom from 1994 to 1996. It comprised 26 20-minute double episodes. Dino Babies was broadcast on many international stations, but the show had a small success in the United States. In 1996, however, the series was syndicated across the world. The show had somewhat better success in Canada, where it aired on YTV from 1994 to 1999. Overview In every episode, the Dino Babies put their own imaginative spin on a classic tale, from \\"Dak and the Beanstalk\\" to \\"The Abominable Snowbaby\\". As fun as these flights of fancy were, they always had something important to say about the dinosaurs themselves and the world around them. By acting out classic tales, the dinosaurs learned valuable moral lessons. Characters *Truman (voiced by Kathleen Barr) – The group's unofficial leader and storyteller, a bespectacled blue brainiac with a tuft of orange hair. *LaBrea (voiced by Andrea Libman) – The only female Dino Baby. A headstrong purple dinosaur with blonde hair, often challenged Truman's authority, but she was a good friend at heart. Probably best known for saying two phrases, the more famous \\"I told you so\\" used whenever something went wrong, and the less frequent \\"Would you evolve?\\" used whenever someone suggested something very silly. *Stanley (voiced by Matt Hill) – A green dinosaur with red spots. He is a bragger who often runs into trouble. He also likes collecting rocks. *Franklin (voiced by Sarah Strange) – A timid, hesitant purple dinosaur. He occasionally shows signs of bravery. *Marshall (voiced by Samuel Vincent) – Franklin's little brother. A brown, diaper-wearing daredevil dinosaur. He sometimes gets upset due to being the smallest of the group, also known by the nickname \\"Marshy\\". He also likes using the phrase; \\"Okie Dokie\\". *Dak (voiced by Scott McNeil) – A blue, attention-starved pterosaur. While he often plays tricks on the group, they remain friends all the same. He usually calls the rest of the group \\"Groundlings\\".

It is a tributary of the Tresa which it joins a few hundred metres upstream of Lake Maggiore. The source is near Valganna. After forming a number of small lakes, including Lago di Ganna and Lago di Ghirla, its course continues through the Prealps of Varese until near Cunardo it is swallowed up by a system of caves: Pont Niv, Antro dei Morti, Grotte di Villa Radaelli and Grotte del Traforo. It emerges from underground near Ferrera di Varese and runs through the crossing the valley’s communes of Grantola, Mesenzana and Germignaga. A cycle path has recently been constructed along this part of the river. The torrent has many affluents. The most important left side tributaries are the Rancina, the Boesio and the Gesone; from the right it receives the waters of the Boggione, the Lisascora and the Grantorella. Thanks to the wet and karstic areas it traverses, the Margorabbia has a generally high discharge and dries up far less frequently than many torrents. These feature made it a useful source of power for the mills and factories which grew up along its banks. The power hammers of Ghirla in the commune of Valganna are particularly well known. The river is subject to sudden and dramatic increases in its flow, becoming truly ‘torrential’. Very often bridges have been destroyed, or it has broken its banks and caused severe flooding in the Valtraviglia. Today many artificial embankments have been constructed along the Margorabbia for the purposes of flood protection.

It is in the civil parish of Odiham. It is located less than south of the town of Hook, on the opposite side of the M3 motorway, and just north-west of the village of Odiham. The Basingstoke Canal passes through the village, and the River Whitewater flows to the north. Today, North Warnborough consists of a conservation area, bounded by Mill Corner in the north and The Street in the south, lying to each side of the B3349 Reading to Alton road. Most of the village's 40 listed buildings lie within the conservation area. There are also later housing developments with post-war housing beyond the southern boundary of the conservation area to the Odiham boundary and also in the Old Orchard. A detailed character appraisal and management plan was prepared and published by Hart District Council in 2009. Held by King Harold before the Norman invasion of 1066, North Warnborough and Odiham had become a royal burgh by 1086. Half- way between Winchester and Windsor, the Saxon kings maintained a palace and lodgings in Odiham. By 1207 work had begun on King John's castle in of meadowland at North Warnborough, the ruins of which stand by the canal, itself a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a unique conservation area. Near the canal lies North Warnborough Green, another SSSI, including a ford where children often swim during the summer months. The village once boasted two mills and seven pubs. Some of the pubs were converted into private homes, but The Lord Derby and The Anchor still remain. The Swan was destroyed by fire in September 2010 and the Jolly Miller is now pending change of use following a short period as 'The Chilli Pad', Thai restaurant. The Millhouse is now a popular family restaurant.

Runyon was a lawyer before the Civil War and mayor of Newark, New Jersey, a major general in command of the New Jersey National Guard until 1873, first president of the Manufacturers' National Bank of Newark, chancellor of New Jersey for 14 years and, between 1893 and 1896, envoy and later ambassador to Germany. Early life Theodore Runyon was born in Somerville, New Jersey of Huguenot descent. He was a direct descendant of Vincent Rongion (1644–1713), a Huguenot who was born in Poitiers, France and settled in New Jersey. Theodore Runyon graduated from Yale University, where he helped found Scroll and Key Society. Runyon was admitted to the New Jersey bar in 1846 and began the practice of law in Newark, New Jersey. Military service As a brigadier general in the New Jersey militia, Runyon commanded the Fourth Division of the Army of Northeastern Virginia in June and July 1861.Eicher, John H., and David J.

Also, neither the 1906 War Department list of Union Army generals nor Historian Ezra J. Warner's Generals in Blue show Runyon as a commissioned Union Army general rather than or in addition to a New Jersey militia general.United States War Department, The Military Secretary's Office, Memorandum Relative to the General Officers in the Armies of the United States During the Civil War, 1861-1865 (Compiled from Official Records.) 1906.

Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1964. .See also Davis, 1977, p. 76 where Davis describes Runyon as \\"New Jersey's Brigadier General Theodore Runyon\\". Runyon held his position as division commander as a State militia or short-term volunteer general, not as a formally commissioned Union Army general.Several officers who commanded Union Army units or State units under Union Army control held this status as apparent federal, but actually only State, officers early in the war. Brigadier General Ebenezer Peirce of the Massachusetts militia, Brigadier General Thomas A. Morris of the Indiana militia and Colonel Joseph H. Tucker of the Illinois militia, an early commandant of Camp Douglas (Chicago) are other officers with similar positions and duties with the Union Army early in the war. On February 25, 1862, Runyon was appointed a brevet major general in the New Jersey militia. After the war, he was elected a companion of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States - a military society of officers of the Union armed forces and their descendants. Fort Runyon, named in Theodore Runyon's honor, was a timber and earthwork fort constructed by the Union Army following the occupation of northern Virginia in order to defend the southern approaches to the Long Bridge as part of the defenses of Washington, D.C. during that war.Civil War Defenses of Washington, National Park Service. Accessed September 20, 2007. =Later career= From 1864 to 1866, Runyon served as mayor of Newark as a Democrat. He had previously been city attorney and city counsel. Runyon was appointed Major General in charge of the New Jersey National Guard and served in this post until 1873. He was the first president of the Manufacturers' National Bank of Newark until he became chancellor of New Jersey, an office he held for 14 years.

A long-time guest lecturer at the University of Reading, he mentored many modern typeface designers. He lived and worked in Bussum, Netherlands. Work Unger developed many typefaces over the years, of which several specially developed for newspapers (usually typefaces with a large x-height and large inner counters), such as Swift, Gulliver, Coranto and Vesta. He also developed designs for magazines, coins, books, logos and stamps. A large number of Unger's typefaces are available from Linotype and the Dutch Type Library; his more recent faces are also available through the foundry Type Together. He released new work on his own website from 1995. Unger designed typefaces for the signage systems of both the Dutch highways (ANWB-fonts) and the Amsterdam metro.

According to André Marty, the Comintern \\"chief organiser\\", about 3,000 Poles volunteered for the International Brigades. Elsewhere, it has been calculated that 5,400 Poles fought in Spain. The majority (3,800) were miners working in France, 300 were Polish-Americans, and several hundred were Poles living in various European countries. Only 800 came from Poland itself. The Dąbrowszczacy Jarosław DąbrowskiThe International Brigades often named its battalions and brigades using stirring historical symbolism. Such symbols included the Italian leader, Giuseppe Garibaldi, the French anthem, La Marseillaise, and contemporary political figures, such as Ernst Thaelmann. The 19th century Polish general, Jarosław Dąbrowski was an obvious choice, too. General Dąbrowski was involved in the January Uprising, in a plot against Tsar Alexander II and imprisoned. In 1865, he fled and escaped to France. In 1871, he was elected to the Paris Commune and took over the defence of the city. He was killed on the barricades, \\"fighting gallantly\\" for a foreign cause. Throughout the Spanish Civil War, the name Dabrowski was used in addition to the unit designation for units with a Polish connection or component. These include the Dabrowski Battalion, the XIII International Brigade (also known as the 13th Dabrowski Brigade) and the 150th International Brigade. See below. Even today, in Poland, Polish veterans of the Spanish Civil War are known as the \\"Dąbrowszczacy\\". The International Brigades  The International Brigades were international in character. Initially, for ease of communication, units were grouped by language or ethnicity. As the war progressed, and the casualty rates increased, this policy eased and reinforcements of Spanish conscripts were sent wherever they were required. The following battalions all had strong Polish connections.  Dabrowski Battalion  Raised in October 1936, the Dabrowski Battalion was one of the first international battalions raised. The first Poles to arrive were miners from the Polish mining communities in Northern France and Southern Belgium. Its first commander was Stanislaw Ulanowski (a former corporal in the Polish army); later Major Tadeusz Oppman took command.  Palafox Battalion  The Palafox Battalion was formed on 28 June 1937 as a unit of the 150th International Brigade. It was formed from Poles, and Soviet citizens, with a nucleus of Spanish volunteers from the La Pasionaria Battalion. \\"Most of the four companies were commanded by Red Army lieutenants\\". On 4 August 1937, two of its companies were sent to reinforce XIII International Brigade, with the remaining companies following in early October. On 12 October 1936, the Palafox Battalion was merged with Mickiewicz Battalion to form the 4th battalion of XIII International Brigade. It remained with the 13th Brigade until the International Brigades were disbanded on 23 September 1938.  Mickiewicz Battalion  1 Coy: 2 Coy: Naftalí Botwin 3 Coy: Adam Mickiewicz (el 4.Oct.1937 forma batalló) 4 Coy: Taras Szewczenki (6.Jul.1937- 2.Aug.1938) 5 Coy: Ludwig Warynski The \\"Dabrowski\\" Brigades : Main articles: XIII International Brigade and 150th International Brigade The XIII International Brigade was first formed in December 1936 and named after Jarosław Dąbrowski. Strangely, it did not contain many Poles in its component battalions. The following July (1937), it was disbanded, together with its battalions, and the men and equipment were dispersed amongst the other International Brigades. On 4 August 1937, it re-formed as a predominantly Polish Brigade. The 150th International Brigade was formed in July 1937.  After demobilisation A reformed Dabrowski Brigade, led by Henryk Torunczyk was formed in January 1939 from stragglers and veterans who remained in Spain after demobilsation. It took part in the Battle of Barcelona. Survivors crossed the Pyrenees with the remnants of the Republican general staff after the fall of Barcelona . On 9 January it crossed French border and was finally dissolved, most if its soldiers were interned. Most of Dąbrowszczacy were members of the Communist Party of Poland. For their communist orientation they were condemned by the authorities of the Second Polish Republic, which cancelled citizenship of many of them (in spite of the fact that Poland was the third biggest arms supplier to the Republic, after the USSR and Mexico). On the other hand, they were portrayed as heroes in the People's Republic of Poland; many of them served in the Berling Army, Armia Ludowa and Gwardia Ludowa during the Second World War.Instytut Pamieci Narodowej Dąbrowszczacy The official rehabilitation came when Polish government issued medals to Polish Spanish Civil war veterans. The first was a white-metal badge - the Odznaka Pamiątkowa Dąbrowszczaków (the \\"Jarosław Dąbrowski Brigade Commemorative Decoration\\") - issued in 1945 to soldiers of the XIII International Brigade. The second was a white-metal medal - the Medal Za Waszą Wolność i Naszą (\\"Medal for our freedom and yours\\") - issued by decree of the State Council of Poland of 18 October 1956. It was awarded to all Polish volunteers who participated on side of the Republic. The ribbon is red with a central white band, reflecting the Spanish Military Order of Merit.

The Bill had been placed before the Houses for inspection but was not formally read into the record. The title of the Act – \\"An Act for the speedy and effectual reducing of the Rebels, in His Majesty's Kingdom of Ireland, to their due Obedience to His Majesty, and the Crown of England\\" – was read out to Parliament, followed by the statement: \\"le roy le veult\\".http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=35806 'House of Lords Journal Volume 4: 19 March 1642', Journal of the House of Lords: volume 4: 1629–42 (1767–1830), pp. 653-658.

The \\"Adventurers\\" were so called because they were risking their money at a time when the Crown had just had to pay for the Bishops' Wars in 1639–40. \\"Reducing\\" the rebels meant leading them back (Latin: reducere) to the legal concept of the \\"King's Peace\\". King Charles could not subsequently enforce the Act, but it was realised by his political opponents following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649–1653, and formed the main legal basis for the contentious Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652. Ironically, in May 1642 the Confederate Irish rebels drafted the Confederate Oath of Association that recognised Charles as their monarch. Auxiliary Acts The Adventurers' Act was extended and amended by three other acts the Lands of Irish Rebels; Adventurers' Subscriptions Act 1640 (c. 34), Lands of Irish Rebels; Adventurers' Subscriptions Act 1640 (c. 35), and Irish Rebels Act 1640 (c. 37).

Plot The story is based on a graphic novel of the same name. It is set in a futuristic, magic-using Soviet Union, which uses floating Skyfurnaces (magical ships) and Warkasters (sorcerers) to conquer its enemies. Gameplay The Red Star is a mix of several video game genres like beat'em up and shooter. The action is seen from the isometric perspective, with the goal of walking around and fighting enemies along the way. RPG elements are also apparent as players have the option of upgrading certain attributes of a character depending on how well levels are completed. The players can choose between three characters: Makita who relies on speed and fast movements, Kyuzo who is slow but resistant and strong and Maya with a balanced approach of speed and power. Maya is unlocked by beating the game once. Losing a life at any point will force a reset to the beginning of the current stage. Development and release In 2003, Acclaim Entertainment signed an exclusive agreement with Archangel Studios to develop a video game based on The Red Star. At the time, it was in development at Acclaim Studios Austin with a scheduled release date in 2004. Ray Peña and Stephen Dupree were given the roles of art and design team leads respectively. Acclaim used an in-house level editor, which allowed them to create a Smash TV-like prototype by using the existing assets from Vexx and Turok Evolution. The Red Star was originally scheduled for release for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on September 4, 2004. The first time that gamers could get their hands on The Red Star was in August 2004 on the Official PlayStation Magazine Demo. Game Informer made an early review on both the PS2 and Xbox versions. The Xbox version was made in parallel with the PlayStation 2 version. It was completed with a press review copy circulating among gaming publications, including Game Informer, but it was never commercially released. After Acclaim went bankrupt in 2004, XS Games took the publishing rights to the game. The PSP port was released in March 2010, exclusively through PlayStation Network. XS Games announced the iOS version of The Red Star on March 5, 2010, for release in Spring 2010.

The film stars Sharmila Tagore, Uttam Kumar, Utpal Dutt and Asit Sen. Both the versions were hits. The Bengali version of the film achieved immense popularity amongst Bengalis and featured many memorable songs by Kishore Kumar like Bipinbabur Karansudha and Ki Asha-y Baandhi Khelaghar. Also, this film featured the Bengali film star Uttam Kumar at the height of his popularity and Utpal Dutt turned in a typically stellar performance as the villain. The film was later remade in Telugu as Edureeta (1977), starring N.T. Rama Rao, in Malayalam as Ithaa Oru Manushyan and in Tamil as Thyagam, with Sivaji Ganesan. After Amanush, Samanta once again made another double version, Anand Ashram (1977), with the same lead actors, however, that film didn't do well at the box office. Plot \\"Amanush\\" (made simultaneously in Bengali and Hindi) to marvel at the scope of the man's histrionic capabilities. Kumar shines as Madhusudan Roy Chaudhary, or Madhu, a straightforward scion of a zamindar family settled in a fishing village in the Sunderbans. He reflects angst and anger with understated ease after his life is ripped asunder by the machinations of the family munim, Maheem Ghosal (a superlative performance by veteran Utpal Dutt). Reduced to a penniless drunkard, he is condemned to live the life of an amanush — half human, and half beast. As a debauched vagabond, he raises his voice on behalf of the downtrodden who suffer under the highhanded and corrupt Ghosal. This brings him face to face with the law enforcers, who are often hand in glove with the wily Ghosal. It is in this backdrop that Inspector Bhuvan (Anil Chatterjee) lands in the village, where Ghosal ‘fills his ears’ against Madhu. Bhuvan, without going into merits of the case, acts harshly on Madhu, even whipping him at the police station. However, soon he comes to know the story of Madhu and his estranged love interest, Rekha (Sharmila Tagore). In a flashback, Madhu tells him how he was entrapped in a fake case of theft in his own house, whereon his ailing paternal uncle, under the influence of the munim, handed him over to the police. He is also accused of fathering a child through a prostitute. Before he can prove his innocence the woman is abducted and killed at the behest of Ghosal. On completing his prison sentence, Madhu returns to his village, only to find that his uncle has been murdered by the munim, who shows it as a case of natural death. Thereon, Bhuvan embarks on a mission to reform Madhu and gets him a contract for building a dam in an adjoining village. A determined Madhu, with his two sidekicks, completes the job commendably. He even wins back the confidence of Rekha, whom he saves from drunken streamer operators one night. But the ice is finally broken when the village is endangered by raging flood waters that threaten to breach the dam. All villagers persuade Madhu to take the mantle of saving the village, but he spurns them, blaming them for his misery. Finally, on a visit by Rekha he relents, and saves the dam and the village from havoc. His honour is restored, as is his love interest. Ghosal is arrested for his wrongdoings by Bhuvan, even as he is transferred to a new posting.

Classification and taxonomy Ausktribosphenidae is closely related to monotremes and hence the two form the yinotherian clade Australosphenida. It includes two species, Ausktribosphenos nyktos and Bishops whitmorei, both of which are known only from skull and jaw fragments. Morphology Like other Australosphenida, ausktribosphenids have tribosphenic molars. Distribution Given that Ausktribosphenidae has been found in Early Cretaceous deposits in Australia, its occurrence has ramifications for knowledge of early monotreme paleobiogeography because Australia was connected only to Antarctica, and placentals originated in the northern hemisphere and were confined to it until continental drift formed land connections from North America to South America, from Asia to Africa and from Asia to India. The late Cretaceous map shows how the southern continents are separated. However, the cladistic analysis of Cifelliodon recovers Fruitafossor as a monotreme relative, suggesting that yinotherians may have originated in the Northern Hemisphere.Adam K.

As player he was successful with Budapest club MTK, and also played for the Hungary national football team. As coach he succeeded in Germany, winning the national championship with 1. FC Nürnberg. His greatest triumphs were to follow in Switzerland with the Grasshopper Club Zürich, where he won seven titles. Kürschner's appearance on the Brazilian scene of brought a push of innovation football there and helped establish the country as one of the giants of world football. Kürschner was born in Hungary, and was Jewish. The player Kürschner was a defensive player on the left side of the field who also found use as centre half. He impressed less with his physique and technique then with his astute positioning and his penchant for headers. His game was marked by simplicity and decisiveness. He played for MTK in his hometown Budapest and contributed to their Championships in 1904 and 1908 as well as their three consecutive wins of the Magyar Kupa between 1910 and 1912. Between 1907 and 1911 he also was called up five times to play for the Hungarian national football team. In 1911, to supplement his income, along with fellow MTK player Gyula Kertész he set up a photographic studio.Jonathan Wilson (2019). The Names Heard Long Ago; How the Golden Age of Hungarian Soccer Shaped the Modern Game The coach =Beginnings in Budapest and Stuttgart= Kürschner commenced his coaching career in 1918 with MTK in Budapest taking over from the previous coach Jimmy Hogan, but departed the following year, moving on to Stuttgarter Kickers in the south-west of Germany. There he stayed for two years and won in 1921 the championship of Württemberg, which qualified the club for the Southern German Championship. =Championship with Nürnberg= Stuttgart were ousted soon, thus Kürschner became available to lead title defenders 1. FC Nürnberg through the play-offs for the national German title. There the Nürnbergers defeated in the final Vorwärts 90 from Berlin (a precursor club to today's SpVgg Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin) with 5–0. After this short-term engagement FC Bayern Munich hired Kürschner for the next season as successor to the great Englishman William Townley. Bayern only managed second place in the Southern Bavarian Championship behind local rivals FC Wacker Munich, and thus failed to qualify for the national tournament. This freed Kürschner to guide Nürnberg through their play-off campaign once more. He led the team to its third consecutive German Championship final where the ascending Hamburger SV was the opponent. Two epic matches over altogether more than five hours in what is referred to in German football folklore as the \\"eternal final\\", did not produce a winner, and in the consequence no title was awarded in that season. In the next season Kürschner was made the first full- time coach of Eintracht Frankfurt. With only one defeat Frankfurt wins the Group I. of the North Main (→ river Main) league, which was then one of the many divisions that constituted first level football in Germany. However, in the matches for the overall North Main championship the local opponent Germania 94 Frankfurt prevails. =Great success in Switzerland= After this Kürschner was to work for many years in Switzerland. His first appointment was in 1923–24 with FC Nordstern Basel, where he also was the first full-time coach in club history. Leading them to promotion to the first division laid the cornerstone to the grandest period in Nordstern's history. Olympic Silver for the national team In 1924 Kürschner joined up with Teddy Duckworth and Jimmy Hogan to prepare the players of the Swiss national football team in regional groups for the Olympic Games in Paris. Of these coaches Hogan deserves particular attention as he is considered one of the great English football pioneers on the continent. His name will remain forever associated with the Austrian Miracle Team of the 1930s, and indirectly also with the rise of Hungarian football which led to the great triumphs of the Magic Magyars in the 1950s. In Paris the team, under the leadership of Duckworth, made it all the way to the finals. Only the giants of that era Uruguay could eventually put a halt to the Swiss juggernaut when they defeated them 3–0 in a hopelessly overcrowded stadium and thus retained their Gold from the previous tournament. To date, this remains the greatest success in the history of Swiss football. Incidentally, in the semi-finals the Urus overcame the Dutch side led by the aforementioned William Townley, who, in those days was also associated with the Swiss club FC St. Gallen. Later in that year, Kürschner briefly became the first full-time coach of Schwarz-Weiss Essen in the west of Germany. In a friendly they defeated Kürschner's home team MTK 2–1. Decade of triumphs with Grasshoppers From 1925 until 1934 Kürschner was in the employ of the Grasshopper Club Zürich. The three national championships in 1927, 1928, and 1931 plus four wins in the Swiss cup final made him the second most successful coach in the history of this club. The German language edition of Wikipedia notes in its article regarding the Grasshoppers, that in 1931 the club was voted the \\"fourth strongest European side by football experts from all over Europe\\". After Kürschner's departure from Switzerland the legendary Austrian Karl Rappan followed the Hungarian on the bench and expanded on the success of the club until 1948. Rappan was also a founding father of the European cup competitions. =Innovator in Rio de Janeiro= He arrived in Rio de Janeiro in March 1937 and within a month saw himself at the helm of CR Flamengo which was then the team of the legendary striker Leonidas da Silva, the famous Rubber Man. Flamengo Card to the movie \\"Alma e Corpo de uma Raça\\" (1938) with Flamengo flag At the Mengão he succeeded Flávio Costa who had been player-manager from September 1934 until January 1937. Costa became Kürschner's assistant and eventually his successor. Beyond this, Costa should once be regarded the probably greatest coach in Brazil in the earlier parts of the 20th century. He was to amass titles not only with Flamengo and local rivals CR Vasco da Gama, but he also led the Brazilian national football team to its then only third Copa América title and even to the, albeit for the local audience anticlimactical, second place in the World Cup finals of 1950. Kürschner promoted a more controlled, defensive style of the game in Brazil. He introduced not only things like training without ball, but most importantly also the WM system, which had been in use in England since the 1920s. In the course of the preparations for the World Cup 1938 in France – where Brazil was to debut amongst the top four – he familiarized the coaching staff of the association with state-of-the-art European football and training methodology. His time with Flamengo came to an end on matchday one of the Campeonato Carioca campaign 1938 on 4 September – a match that was also used for the opening of the club's new Estádio da Gávea. Flamengo lost 0–2 to Vasco da Gama. This triggered a crisis and led to the almost instantaneous sacking of Kürschner. Botafogo Later on in 1939 Kürschner was hired by Botafogo FR, then based in a district close by to Flamengo, where he achieved a third consecutive second place in the Championship of Rio. He nevertheless was let go from Botafogo in August 1940. In April 1941 he was one of the contenders for the coaching position of the Canto do Rio FC of Niterói on the other side of Guanabara Bay when the club prepared for joining the Rio Championship. On the evening of 8 December 1941 he died from a heart attack. He was laid to rest in the Cemetery São João de Batista in Botafogo. Film Kürschner can be seen in the Brazilian movie Alma e Corpo de uma Raça (\\"Body and Soul of a Race\\") from 1938 by director Milton Rodrigues (1905–1972).

The group released several singles and two albums, initially for the German independent record label Pure Freude and later for Elektra Records. Belfegore are probably best known now for the US college radio hit \\"All That I Wanted\\", the video to which aired on MTV, VH1 and USA Network.  History  Belfegore was a project and brainchild of the German singer and guitarist Michael (Meikel) David Clauss, formerly of Nichts and Der KFC, with Manfred \\"Charly\\" Terstappen (aka Charly T Charles) and Walter Jaeger, formerly with Die Krupps. The band was formed 1982 in Düsseldorf and quickly became part of the Neue Deutsche Welle (German New Wave) movement, playing a distinctly German style of new wave music that owed a lot to both the early UK goth scene as well as the European punk movement. Their first album, A Dog Is Born was a mostly self-financed affair, gaining limited release in Germany through Pure Freude and imported into the UK by Rough Trade Records. This release was followed by the self-titled 12\\" EP Belfegore and the 7\\" live single \\"Marmor\\". In 1983, just as the group signed a record deal with Elektra, Jaeger left the band and was replaced by Raoul Walton. The resultant album, Belfegore, produced by Conny Plank and released with two different cover versions, saw a shift away from the more experimental new wave sound to something harder-edged. The band supported U2 on the European part of the Unforgettable Fire Tour. In 1985, Clauss dissolved the band because he claimed he'd had enough of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle and he went on to study medicine in Germany. Raoul Walton later played with the German rock band Anyone's Daughter. In 1988, Charly Terstappen joined The Lords, one of Germany's longest-serving rock bands. The video for \\"All That I Wanted\\", which was directed by Academy Award-winning director Zbigniew Rybczyński in one of his first forays into music video (he also directed promos for Art of Noise and Propaganda), was also aired on MuchMusic in Canada, to much acclaim. On 30 September 2011, the band (Clauss/Walton/Terstappen) played a one-off reunion gig at 'Ratinger Hof' in Düsseldorf. In 2011, acclaimed director David Fincher used \\"All That I Wanted\\" off of their second album in his adaption of Stieg Larsson's worldwide bestseller, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the first novel in the Millennium series. It was featured in the background during a scene when the titular character, Lisbeth Salander, is hacking Mikael Blomkvist's computer and does background checks on Dirch Frode and Hans-Erik Wennerström. The latter becomes an important part of the plot in the series as the story progresses.  Members  * Meikel Clauss: Vocals/guitar/electronics * Manfred Terstappen (\\"Charly T.

Playing career Turner began his playing career with Peterborough United in 1969. He went on to make 314 league appearances as a defender, scoring 37 goals. 1977 saw him spend a loan spell in the US with the Connecticut Bicentennials, an experience he enjoyed so much that he moved permanently to the New England Tea Men a year later. He returned to England to join Luton Town the same year, and although he did well during his season in Bedfordshire, he moved back to New England at the end of the season. At the end of the American season, he switched again, this time to join Cambridge United. He played for one season at Cambridge, playing 19 times before leaving the country to play in the American Soccer League once again with New England. After returning to England he joined up with Swindon Town for a brief spell before returning to Cambridge. Turner ended a 15-year playing career with a spell at Southend United before retiring in 1984. Coaching career In December 1985, Cambridge United had sacked their manager Ken Shellito and were looking for a new appointment. Turner was appointed as his replacement. He managed Cambridge until January 1990, stabilising a club that was at rock bottom and turning them slowly into promotion candidates. He built much of the squad that he would later hand over to John Beck to take the team up from the Fourth Division to Second Division. He took on his next managerial position at his first club, Peterborough United, in January 1991 and managed the club until December 1992, going on to be one of the most successful managers in the club's history. He retired from football in 1992 and went on to own the club as chairman before selling his interest to Barry Fry in 1996. In 2006, Turner teamed up with ex-Peterborough player Lee Power, who was then chairman of Cambridge United, to help out in a temporary coaching role at the club. But soon afterwards he became ill with what was later diagnosed as frontal lobe dementia, and by April 2014 he was living in a nursing home. In the last five years of his life, Turner was reportedly unable to walk, talk or eat solid foods. He died on 27 April 2015, aged 64 years old.Chris Turner: Former Peterborough United manager dies, aged 64 - BBC References External links * *NASL profile Category:1951 births Category:2015 deaths Category:English footballers Category:Cambridge United F.C. players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Peterborough United F.C. players Category:Swindon Town F.C. players Category:North American Soccer League (1968–1984) players Category:Connecticut Bicentennials players Category:New England Tea Men players Category:English football managers Category:Cambridge United F.C. managers Category:Peterborough United F.C. managers Category:People from St Neots Category:Deaths from Alzheimer's disease Category:English expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:English expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:English Football League players Category:Association football defenders Category:English football chairmen and investors Category:Southend United F.C. players ","title":"Chris Turner (footballer, born 1951)"},{"id":"10771731","text":"André Luiz Barreto Silva Lima (born 3 May 1985 in Rio de Janeiro), commonly known as André Lima, is a Brazilian footballer who last played for Austin Bold.

He was known as an unsuccessful candidate for senator in the Philippine general elections in 2007. In 2013, Kiram III sparked a controversy when he revived a dispute between the Philippines and Malaysia by leading an intrusion into the eastern part of Sabah. His daughter is Princess Jacel Kiram, a proponent of the Sabah claim of the Philippines in 2016. Early life Jamalul was born in Mainbung, Sulu. He was the eldest son of Datu Punjungan Kiram and Sharifa Usna Dalus Strattan. He is descended from the first Sultan of Sulu, Sharif ul-Hāshim of Sulu from the Banu Hashem tribe, the direct descendants of Muhammad. Kiram III also claimed to have a common ancestor with Brunei's current sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, although this was denied by Brunei. Kiram III studied in Jolo Central Elementary School from 1946 to 1951. He finished high school at the Sulu High School in 1955 and took up pre-law from 1956 to 1958 at Notre Dame of Jolo. He studied for a Bachelor of Law degree from Manuel L. Quezon University (MLQU) in 1964 but was unable to finish it and pursued a career in dance instead. He was married to Dayang Hadja Fatima Celia H. Kiram, and resided in Taguig City, Metro Manila. He had two daughters, including Jacel Kiram. Reign He claimed to be responsible for the release of the American and the German nationals from the captivity of the lost command of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in 1984. He established livelihood programs in Sulu, Tawi-Tawi and Palawan through the Sulu-Marine and Seven Seas Corporations. During the Zamboanga City crisis, he criticised his previous ally, Nur Misuari, for waging a war against the Philippine government. He also served as the president of the Philippine Pencak Silat Association and once served as a board member in the Philippine Olympic Committee. In the 2007 elections, he unsuccessfully ran as Senator under the banner of TEAM Unity. He had previously Legislative and Executive Advisory Council on the Sabah Claim Presidential Adviser on Muslim Royalties' Concern under Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. With his retirement, the succession rights of the sultanate was disputed among his heirs such as Mohammad Akijal Atti. The dispute on the succession rights ended on 11 November 2012 when claimants from the Kiram family (descendants of Punjungan Kiram only) met together in Sulu, ending their decade-long feud. After the family meeting, Kiram III once again became the self-proclaimed Sultan alongside Ismael Kiram II. He also declared Rajah Mudah Agbimuddin Kiram as \\"crown prince\\". He was a member of the Ruma Betchara (Council of the Sultan) during the reign of his late uncle, Esmail Kiram. He acted in place of his father during the absence of his father Punjungan Kiram while in Sabah and later proclaimed himself in 1984 as 33rd Sultan of Sulu and was crowned on 15 June 1986 in Jolo, Sulu. Kiram III forged the century-old relationships between Sulu and China during a so-called royal visit to Dezhou, where the descendants of Sulu King Paduka Pahala live, in the Shandong Province of the People's Republic of China in September 1999 with an 87-man entourage. The visit concluded with the signing of the agreement between Hebei Province and the Sulu Sultanate on agricultural technology exchange. He also forged bilateral relationships between the Don Sasagawa Foundation of Japan and the Sultan Jamalul Ahlam Foundation. Jamalul Alam was the recipient of various hospital equipment from Japan which were in turn donated to the Sulu Provincial Hospital in 1992. Beginning on 9 February 2013, approximately 200 men led by his brother, Agbimuddin Kiram intruded into neighbouring Sabah in Malaysia by entering illegally into Lahad Datu, in an effort to assert the former Sulu Sultanate's claim to the state. Kiram was reported to have directed them to intrude and not leave, claiming that \\"Malaysia is only renting Sabah\\" from the heirs of the Sultanate. The men, many of whom were heavily armed, engaged in a standoff with Malaysian police and armed forces which saw the death of 56 of his followers while the rest were either captured or escaped. The intrusion into neighbouring territory was believed to have been caused when the Philippine government treated him and his wife only as \\"decorations\\" during the signing of a framework agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). President Benigno Aquino III blamed Kiram and his followers for dragging the Philippines into the dispute, with a bad impact on overseas Filipinos in Malaysia and hurting relations between the two. His act drew criticism from most Filipinos in Sabah as many of them have become a victim of discrimination and retaliation from the local Borneo tribes due to the killing of Malaysian police who mainly comprising the indigenous Borneo races, as well from other claimants who decried his actions and want to retake the eastern part of Sabah through peaceful means without any bloodshed. Death On 20 October 2013, Kiram III died at the age of 75 due to multiple organ failure. He made a dying request to be buried at the capital of the Sultanate in Maimbung, Sulu. He left eight children by two wives. Numerous political personalities paid their respects to the late Sultan including Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Governor Mujiv Hataman and Sulu Vice-governor Abdusakur Mahail Tan, Former First Lady of the Philippines Imelda Marcos, and the Malacañang Palace. His spokesman said that their \\"royal family\\" would continue to pursue their main intention over the former dispute between Philippines and Malaysia. The Malaysian branch of police in Sabah has stated that they \\"would continue to be alert for any intrusion\\". Family Kiram III's daughter, Princess Jacel Kiram, is the designated spokeswoman of the late sultan and the most known of all the members of the Sulu royal family. The princess is currently living in a subdivision established by the Philippine government in Taguig City in 1974, along with other members of Kiram III's family. Her father's royal bloodline established her royal ties with the Muslim royals of Sulu, Basilan, Tawi-tawi, Maguindanao, and Lanao del Sur. Her grandmother from the maternal side came from Pangasinan in the Ilocos Region, while her grandfather came from Sorsogon in the Bicol Region. Her name is literally an amalgamation of the Muslim name, Jamulul (from her father), and the Christian name, Celia (from her mother). In 2002, she finished her bachelor of arts with a degree in Inter-Disciplinary Studies at De La Salle–College of Saint Benilde. During that time, her thesis, “The Sulu Sultanate’s Genealogy and its Relation to the Philippines’ Claim to Sabah” was declared as Best Thesis. In 2013, she married Moh Yusop Hasan, a Filipino army major. In 2017, she headed the Philippine delegation on the 19th World Festival of Youth and Students in the World Federation of Democratic Youth held in Sochi, Russia. She was also a delegate of the Philippines to China in celebration of the 600th Year of Sulu-China Friendship, coinciding with the book launching of Friendship Without Borders, in Guangxi. Jacel also participated in a United Nations-sponsored conference on Drug Control Program held at the United Nations Office in Vienna, Austria.

He was also the main vocalist of Japanese male idol group Kanjani Eight,Arashi y Kanjani8, los favoritos de jpop masculino 2010 which debuted with modern enka, before he left the group in 2018. His first solo album Nisai was released in October 2019. Shibutani was already a singer in his own right before the group's debut, immensely popular among Johnny's Jr. fans as the top Kansai Jr. of his time. Career Shibutani entered Johnny & Associates in 1996 on his birthday, September 22 (along with future fellow Kanjani Eight member Ryūhei Maruyama) after passing an audition. He did not hear from the agency until December 1996, when he was called to a second audition for a KinKi Kids concert. It was there where he first met two other future fellow members You Yokoyama and Shingo Murakami. Shibutani's ability to sing was acknowledged during the recording of an original Kansai Jr. song \\"Boys in the West Side\\", theme song for Kanjani Knights, a Kansai Jr. show that ran in 1998. He was a regular on the show together with Yokoyama and Murakami. The trio went on to appear on many Jr shows together, becoming close co-workers and dubbing themselves \\"3baka\\" (\\"the 3 idiots\\"). Together with Ryo Nishikido, they were dubbed the four top Kansai Jrs. This meant increased exposure, with opportunities to appear in many Jr shows in Tokyo as well. Shibutani's big break was an outstanding solo performance on Music Station which would see him move to live in Tokyo, followed shortly by Yokoyama and Murakami. At Tokyo, he received many singing jobs and the 3baka became a fixture in the Tokyo Jr TV programs; They went on to star in their own TV series, IkeIkeIkemen, and were regulars on Koichi Domoto's show Pikaichi. Around 2000 to 2001, work offers from the agency diminished greatly for the Kansai Jrs. Out of work in Tokyo, they moved back to Osaka, and found part-time jobs to supplement their salaries. In 2002, Johnny Kitagawa had the Kansai Jrs put on an old play previously performed by their seniors, SMAP and KinKi Kids, called Another. This marked a revival of Kansai Jr activities but Kitagawa's strategy this time was to localize the Kansai Jrs' activities and keep them based in Kansai. Shibutani returned to the stage. He also appeared on TV regularly, on J3Kansai. In 2003, Johnny Kitagawa formed Kanjani Eight using the top Kansai Jrs. He decided to have Shibutani sing enka and debut Kanjani Eight with him as lead singer. In August 2004, the group released its first single, Naniwa Iroha Bushi, an enka song infused with rap. The single made it to No. 8 on the Oricon singles chart despite its Kansai-limited release. This was followed by a nationwide release the following month that shot Naniwa to the top of the chart. Shibutani and his fellow members learned about their official debut through the newspapers. Kanjani Eight's songs encompass a wide range of styles besides enka and pop; rap, jazz, funk, rock-and-roll, blues, dance, ballad, and disco are among the other styles featured. In addition, Shibutani is also the main vocalist for Kanjani Eight subgroups, SanKyoudai, an acoustic music group, and SubaruBand, a rock band. He also plays several instruments, the guitar, harmonica and shamisen. As a Jr., Shibutani wrote several original songs in collaboration with the guitarist of Jr. band FIVE, Nakaegawa Rikiya, who composed the melodies. These songs were performed by Shibutani with FIVE. Subaru also collaborates with Kanjani8 band member, Shota Yasuda. The two write the songs for their band, SubaruBand (ONE, High Position, DownUp).

The interior. The Corsini Chapel. The vault of the nave by Domenico Stagi. Santa Maria del Carmine is a church of the Carmelite Order, in the Oltrarno district of Florence, in Tuscany, Italy. It is famous as the location of the Brancacci Chapel housing outstanding Renaissance frescoes by Masaccio and Masolino da Panicale, later finished by Filippino Lippi. History The church, dedicated to the Beatæ Virginis Mariæ de monte Carmelo, was founded by a group of Carmelite friars from Pisa. Construction of the church commenced in 1268 as part of the Carmelite convent,\\"Cappella Brancacci\\", Musei Civici Fiorentini which still exists today. Of the original edifice only some Romanesque-Gothic remains can be seen on the sides. By the 14th century, it was the seat of a number of lay fraternities. The complex was enlarged a first time in 1328 and again in 1464, when the capitular hall and the refectory added, though the church maintained the Latin Cross, one nave plan. Renovated in the Baroque style in the 16th–17th centuries, it was damaged by a fire in 1771 which destroyed the interior of the church. It was rebuilt internally in the Rococo style in 1782. The façade, like in many Florentine churches, remained unfinished. The fire did not touch the sacristy: therefore have survived the Stories of St. Cecilia attributed to Lippo d'Andrea (c. 1400) and the marble monument of Pier Soderini by Benedetto da Rovezzano (1511–1513). The vault of the nave has a trompe-l'oeil, quadratura fresco by Domenico Stagi. Brancacci Chapel The Brancacci Chapel also survived the fire, and was saved by the subsequent restoration by the intervention of a Florentine noblewoman who was firmly opposed to the covering of the frescoes. The Chapel is home to the famous frescoes by Masaccio and Masolino, considered the first masterwork of the Italian Renaissance. Masaccio's master Masolino, commissioned by a wealthy merchant, Felice Brancacci, began work on the chapel in 1425 and was soon joined in the project by his pupil, Masaccio. The scenes by Masolino are St Peter Healing a Lame Man and Raising Tabitha from the Dead, St Peter Preaching, and Adam and Eve. Those by mostly Masaccio are The Tribute Money, St Peter Healing with his Shadow, The Crucifixion of St Peter, The Baptism of the Neophytes, and The Expulsion from Paradise.Paul Joannides (1993) Masaccio and Masolino: A Complete Catalogue. Phaidon: London. Their treatment of figures in believable space made the frescoes among the most important to have come out of the Early Renaissance. The cycle was finished by Filippino Lippi. The elaborated Italian Rococo ceiling is from one of the most important 18th century artists in the city, Giovanni Domenico Ferretti. Corsini Chapel The Corsini, one of the richest families in Florence during the 17th–18th centuries, had this chapel built in 1675-1683, to hold the remains of an ancestral member of the family, St Andrea Corsini (1301–1374), who became a Carmelite friar and the Bishop of Fiesole, and who was canonized in 1629. The architect Pier Francesco Silvani choose for it the Baroque style then popular in Rome. The altar has a marble bas-relief depicting the Glory of St Andrea Corsini, sculpted by Foggini, and above a God the Father sculpted by Carlo Marcellini. On the sides of the altar are two more Foggini marble bas-reliefs: one depicts Sant'Andrea descends girded with sword to lead the Florentines to victory during the Battle of Anghiari and the other recalls a Miraculous vision of the Virgin by a young Sant'Andrea (occurring in the church of the Convent delle Selve). The small dome was frescoed by Giordano in 1682. The frescoes suffered in the great church fire, and were restored by Stefano Fabbrini.Firenze antica, e moderna illustrate, Volume 8, by V. Follini, M. Rastrelli, (1802), pages 103-105. The convent The convent suffered in its history from numerous disasters, from the 1771 fire to the 1966 River Arno flood. Most of the artworks are therefore fragmentary: these include the Bestowal of the Carmelite Rule by Filippo Lippi and the Last Supper by Alessandro Allori, and remains of works from other chapels by Pietro Nelli and Gherardo Starnina. The second refectory is decorated with the Supper in Simon the Pharisee's house by Giovanni Battista Vanni (c. 1645); it also houses fragments of frescoes by Lippo d'Andrea.

Distribution  It is found in southern Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and in the United States is found from Maine south to south Florida; west to North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Texas. It also can be found in Mexico.  Description  Darapsa myron MHNT CUT 2010 0 301 Leeds county Ontario Canada male dorsal.jpgMale dorsal Darapsa myron MHNT CUT 2010 0 301 Leeds county Ontario Canada male ventral.jpgMale ventral  Biology  There are 2 or 3 broods in much of the range, and larvae can mature in as few as 3 weeks. Larvae hide on the midribs of their host leaves and are nocturnal feeders. During July and August, this species is abundant in many areas, particularly Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Adults emerge in the mid-afternoon and females begin calling after dusk. In spring, adults are more likely to feed, nectaring from flowers and drinking fluids from rotting fruit. In areas where they are common, D. myron readily come to both lights and sugar baits, being most active between sunset and midnight. Females have much rounder abdomens while the end of the male's abdomen is spade-shaped. Pairing is fairly quick and captive adults do not need to be fed, although females lay more eggs when fed. Sometimes adults refuse food altogether. Mated females deposit up to 150 small eggs that start out green but turn yellow within 48 hours, indicating fertility. Incubation lasts about 6 days. Fully grown larvae turn a purplish brown before spinning a sparse, wiry cocoon among host leaves. Pupae either eclose within about 24 days or diapause, eclosing in late May. The caterpillars are known to feed on virginia creeper, Ampelopsis, and grape.

However, she is not able to catch the said train on time as the station master takes time to give her the railway ticket to Bombay. She doesn’t have any place to go and decides to wait at the station for the next train, the following morning. She's carrying an attache case containing jewellery worth lakhs. She deposits it to Rohit, which he safely locks in his safe. Since Rohit feels it's not safe for her to wait at the platform he offers to drop her at his quarters, near by and she readily agrees to it. It's so obvious that she's running away from someone and Rohit feels she must have stolen the jewellery but she denies the accusation. She tells him that she inherited them from her mother but there are goons behind her because of it. And she's escaping from them. He buys the story and assured that she's safe and comfortable there, he goes back to the station. Sitting on his chair in his office, he goes back in time and lives in flashback for a while thinking about how he first came across Rashmi (Zeenat Aman). He's riding a motorcycle on his way to his uncle's (Asit Sen) house for his cousin's wedding. On the road he sees a car ahead of him and they have a race. After a while, Rashmi's car runs out of petrol. Attempting to help her and also not wanting to lose an opportunity of spending some time with a lovely dame, he empties all the petrol from his motorcycle into Rahmi's car and decides to travel along in her car. But before he can get in, she drives off. With no petrol, he gets stuck and finally manages to get a lift in a lorry. They meet a couple of times during his stay there and they fall in love. Her father, Diwan Sardarilal (Hari Shivdasani), is looking for an assistant for Moti Babu (Prem Chopra), her brother-in-law, who has been looking after the business now. And Diwan feels Moti Babu is over-burdened with work and responsibilities. Rashmi presents Rohit to Diwan and he agrees to hire him. Rashmi has a hunch that Moti Babu is not as honest as he appears to be and tells Rohit about it. Rohit immediately begins auditing the records and discovers that the entries are not correct and a huge sum of money has been missing. Moti Babu, scared that the truth will come out, plots against Rohit. Since Rashmi is so fond of him, the best way to get Rohit out of his way would be to somehow make her dislike him. As a part of the plan, they have a celebration with lots of Bhaang followed a dance \\"Satra baras ki\\". And with the help of Bahadur and Bijli he manages to prove that Rohit tried to rape Bijli and has cheated on Rashmi. As per Panchayat's decision, a punishment, he's thrashed in front of the villagers and asked to leave the place immediately. Moti Babu is celebrating his victory with Bahadur and Bijli. Rashmi happens to witness this and is disgusted. Much against wishes of Diwan and Moti Babu, she leaves the house and runs away with Rohit singing \\"Hum dono do premee\\". They go to Bombay and get married in a temple. Two men show up at his office and they wake him up from his reverie. They introduce themselves as Inspector Tiwari and Inspector Sinha and enquire about a girl with an attache – Sonia. They tell him that she has stolen some valuables and has run away, and they are investigating the case. Though suspicious, Rohit doesn’t reveal her whereabouts. He goes to his quarters and confronts her. But she tells him she hasn’t stolen anything and gives him her mother's letter. After reading it he's convinced that she's innocent. He comes back to his office. It's raining very heavily outside. Standing by the window he stares out and gets into a flashback mode again. This time the newly wed Rashmi and Rohit are singing \\"Bheegi bheegi raaton mein\\" in the rain. Brought up the way she was, Rashmi doesn’t know much of household work. She has a tough time trying to learn how to cook. They get acquainted with Chetan Kumar (Asrani), who lives in the floor below and become friends with him. He also helps her develop her culinary skills. Rohit works for Bombay Publicity, an Ad Agency and Rashmi, on the other hand gets bored sitting at home the whole day with nothing to do. Since she has a good knowledge of colours she starts painting (inspired by Chetan) and wants to gift the painting to Rohit on his birthday. One fine day Chetan suggests her to start modelling. Having seen how his boss, M.M. Puri (Madan Puri) deals with models, Rohit is not happy about how the modelling world works. But Rashmi, with a wealthy background is not used to live the way she is living and doesn’t like compromising for every little thing. And she remains adamant about her decision until Rohit gives in. Indifferences start creeping in but Rohit is understanding and does all he can to keep Rashmi happy, though his ego keeps coming in between (sounds contradicting?). In no time she becomes a top model and even goes on to win a beauty pageant. She becomes thrilled with the idea that now within a short span of time, name and fame would knock her doors. Soon after this, she realises she's expecting. She wants to pursue her career and thinks it's not the right time to start a family and even thinks of going for an abortion. But Rohit wants the child. So she decides to keep it. One day Rohit calls and when she goes down to Chetan's flat to answer the call, she slips and falls down the staircase. This results in a miscarriage. But Rohit feels she got an abortion done and gets mad at her, this is due to an incident at his office. They have a row and he walks out of the house. Having realised that he over- reacted, he comes back home in the evening and apologises but only after a while he finds out that Rashmi has left the house and gone. He later on learns from Chetan that she had fallen down and had a miscarriage. He calls her but she doesn't speak to him. He resigns from Bombay Publicity and he sets out to bring her back. He goes to Diwan's house but learns that they have left the place and gone on a vacation. No one knows when they’ll come back. Devastated, he goes to his uncle's house. There's a letter for him there, a legal notice asking for a divorce. Not knowing what to do next, he seeks employment and with the help of Mr. Saxena (Mama's friend), he gets the post of a Station Master at a remote hill station, Deena Pur. Back to present...he’s at work and Mr. Saxena comes to meet him. He's surprised to see Mr. Saxena at such a remote place. To this, Mr. Saxena says he had come hunting with Diwan Sardarilal, who has put up at a place named Karimganj, nearby. He leaves for Karimganj to meet Rashmi. Rashmi seeing him doesn't seem to be happy. Rohit on the other hand tries wooing her back and further requests her to join his new residence that he got as a railway employee. Meanwhile, Rashmi's father enters the scene and instructs Rashmi to get away from there. He and Moti babu tries every possible way to humiliate Rohit due to his low socio-economic condition. Rohit further remaining confident vows before Moti Babu to bring in money in order to get Rashmi back. Back at present, Rohit realises he needs to arrange in money in order to bring back his estranged wife back. However, he is devastated to realise that he has no such money on his own but only the jewellery worth 5 lakhs in his office's locker belonging to the young lady who took refuge in his quarter. He further decides to open the locker and steal away the attache by strangling the lady to death. However, he comes back to his actual senses and realises he was about to commit a heinous crime under the pretext of bringing his wife back. Meanwhile, fate decided to play another ruthless game on Rohit. The very next moment he finds himself arrested for the real murder of the lady which he is actuality never committed.but Rashmi says in court that she has saw the real murderer Sinha and Tiwary.

Early life and training Born in Prahran, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Marden was the fifth child of English parents, John Marden, a butcher, and his wife Catherine, née Murphy. He was educated at The Geelong College and the University of Melbourne, where he graduated as a Master of Arts in Mathematics and Physics. Whilst completing his law degree, Marden married a schoolteacher, Jane Armstrong at Cape Clear, on 20 December 1883. He also returned to his old school, The Geelong College, this time as a teacher under notable educator George Morrison, moving to the Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne (M.L.C Melbourne) as a Science master three years later. Career In July 1887, the committee of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of New South Wales advertised for an appropriate Principal for its new school, The Presbyterian Ladies' College in Sydney. Marden applied for the position and was unanimously selected \\"because of his high academic standing, his experience and success in teaching and his high Christian character.\\" He opened the school with 39 students on 30 January 1888, at Fernlea, a fourteen- roomed gentleman's residence in Ashfield (the current site of the Sydney Private Hospital), with Miss M. McCormick as lady superintendent. Together with the Committee set up by the Presbyterian Church in N.S.W for establishing P.L.C, he was responsible for organising the curriculum and hiring the appropriate staff. Shubra Hall and PLC students, 1892 In 1890, after his examination in jurisprudence, the University of Sydney conferred on him the degree of LL.D. That year the College had outgrown the Ashfield site, and so the Presbyterian Church in New South Wales purchased Shubra Hall, the home of Anthony Hordern III, at Croydon. Marden worked closely with Albert Bond, the architect of the new school, and was responsible for most of the ideas for the new buildings, based on what he had seen at M.L.C Melbourne. Keenly interested in horticulture, he also laid out impressive gardens and playing fields. In 1916, due to the overwhelming popularity of the Presbyterian Ladies' College, and under Marden's guidance, the school bought at Pymble for £15,000, and established a second campus, The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Pymble (now Pymble Ladies' College). Both campuses were administered by a single council until 1929. Marden was Headmaster of the two schools until ill health forced his resignation in 1919. Marden administered both of his schools with firm discipline, kindness, understanding and generosity, and winning the respect and affection of his pupils, strongly influenced them. He was a strong believer in equal opportunity in education, and has been described as an \\"early feminist\\" and \\"truly a man before his time.\\" He scorned the idea that P.L.C Croydon was some kind of finishing school for daughters of the wealthy, and was quoted as saying: > I am ... out of sympathy with the cry that education is unnecessary for > girls, and that all they require is a few accomplishments. Women have also > to live their life - in most cases a harder one than men have. This notion > of accomplishments being sufficient for girls is surely a remnant of those > barbarous days when women were looked on as the plaything of men. He believed that women should share in opportunities for secondary and tertiary education, and also hold high Christian ideals. Although trained as a lawyer, he gave physics, chemistry and biology a prominent place at a time when few schools included much science in the curriculum. He also instituted a house system in both schools. In his later years he was assisted by a prominent educational innovator, Dr E. Neil McQueen, a scientist and an ardent advocate of the Dalton plan for education, who later succeeded him at the Croydon College. Retirement and death Upon his retirement in 1919, Marden purchased a residence at Wentworth Falls where he spent his leisure time and holidays, and exercised his horticultural skills. It was here that he also he became friendly with Peter Board, then director of education. Marden was active in the Presbyterian Church, serving as an elder at Ashfield for 28 years, and for his last six years at Wentworth Falls. He died at Randwick on 29 October 1924 at 69 years of age, and was buried in South Head Cemetery. His wife, son and three daughters survived him. Legacy The Marden Memorial Library at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney, Marden Boarding House at Pymble Ladies' College and Marden house are named after him.

Scheierstoren in the 19th century, by Willem Koekkoek The myth that it was the place where sailor's wives were weeping when their men set sail is a romantic falsification. Schreierstoren is known mainly for the fact that women wept there for their husbands, who would leave from that port, to go to war, or to fish. (Most of the weeping that was done was for the fishermen who left from that port.) While many in history have called this (the weeping, that is) a myth, there is one thing that may prove this a fact: there is a “memory tablet” in the tower, dating back to 1566, which “commemorates” a woman who was so “heart-grieved” at the depart of her husband, that she went insane.

The Hedeby stones are four runestones from the 10th century found at the town of Hedeby in northern Germany. This area was part of Denmark during the Viking Age. Stone of Eric The Stone of Eric (cataloged as Hedeby 1 or DR 1 under the Rundata system) was found in 1796 at Danevirke and moved to a park in Schleswig. Like the Skarthi Stone, it is believed to have been raised around 995, the year when Hedeby was attacked by the Swedish king Eric the Victorious who took advantage of the fact that Sweyn Forkbeard was campaigning in England. Sigtrygg Runestones The big Sigtrygg Stone (Hedeby 2 or DR 2) was found in 1797 in Hedeby, and the small Sigtrygg Stone (Hedeby 4 or DR 4) was found in 1887. The Sigtrygg Stones was raised around the year 938. Skarthi Stone Side view of the Skarthi Stone. The Skarthi Stone (), also known as Hedeby 3 or DR 3 for its Rundata catalog number, was found in 1857 at Danevirke. It was raised in about 982. This granite runestone is currently displayed at the Hedeby Viking Museum. The reference in the inscription to King Sveinn is believed to refer to Sweyn Forkbeard (Old Norse Sveinn Tjúguskegg), and \\"the west\\" to a campaign in England. The king commissioned the stone in honor of Skarði, who had the title heimþega or heimþegi (pl. heimþegar), meaning \\"home-receiver\\" (i.e., one who is given a house by another). A total of six runestones in Denmark refer to a person with this title, the others being DR 1, DR 154, DR 155, DR 296, and DR 297. The use of the term in the inscriptions suggest a strong similarity between heimþegar and the Old Norse term húskarl (literally, \\"house man\\"), or housecarl. Like housecarls, heimþegar are in the service of a king or lord, of whom they receive gifts (here, homes) for their service. Some, like Johannes Brøndsted, have interpreted heimþegi as being nothing more than a local Danish variant of húskarl. =Runic inscription= Transliteration into Latin characters :A : suin : kunukʀ : sati : ¶ stin : uftiʀ : skarþa ¶ sin : himþiga : ias : uas : ¶ : farin : uestr : ion : nu : :B : uarþ : tauþr : at : hiþa:buProject Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for DR 3.

History  The Movie Channel began in 1990 as one of the channels of British Satellite Broadcasting, a consortium formed in 1986 by Granada Television, Pearson, Virgin, Anglia Television and Amstrad. Prior to its launch, BSB signed an exclusive first-run deal with UIP Pay TV (which distributed Paramount, Universal and MGM/UA releases). One of its first film premieres was the James Bond film, The Living Daylights, starring Timothy Dalton. In 1990, BSB and Sky Television suffered heavy losses and merged, operating as the newly formed British Sky Broadcasting. The Movie Channel, along with The Sports Channel, remained on air, keeping its name, and the channel launched on the Astra 1B satellite on 15 April 1991.

Wolsey commissioned a tomb for himself, but fell from royal favour before its completion, but King Henry VIII of England ordered its completion. King Charles I of England wished to be buried in it although it remained empty until Nelson was buried in it.

His work ranges from sculpture and kinetic art to painting, installation and performance art. He lives and works from Manila and Berlin. Medalla was born in Manila, the Philippines, in 1942. At the age of 14 he was admitted to Columbia University in New York upon the recommendation of American poet Mark van Doren, where he studied ancient Greek drama with Moses Hadas, modern drama with Eric Bentley, modern literature with Lionel Trilling, modern philosophy with John Randall and attended the poetry workshops of Léonie Adams. During the late 1950s he returned to Manila and met the Spanish poet Jaime Gil de Biedma and the painter Fernando Zóbel de Ayala, who both became the earliest patrons of his art. During the 1960s in Paris, the French philosopher Gaston Bachelard introduced Medalla's performance of 'Brother of Isidora' at the Academy of Raymond Duncan, later, Louis Aragon would introduce another performance and finally, Marcel Duchamp honoured him with a 'medallic' object. His work was included in Harald Szeemann's exhibition 'Weiss auf Weiss' (1966) and 'Live in Your Head: When Attitudes Become Form' (1969) and in the DOCUMENTA 5 exhibition in 1972 in Kassel. During the early 1960s he moved to the United Kingdom and in 1964 co-founded the Signals Gallery in London, which presented international kinetic art. He was editor of the Signals news bulletin from 1964 to 1966. In 1967 he initiated the Exploding Galaxy, an international confluence of multi-media artists, significant in hippie/counterculture circles, particularly the UFO Club and Arts Lab. From 1974 to 1977 he was chairman of Artists for Democracy, an organisation dedicated to 'giving material and cultural support to liberation movements worldwide' and director of the Fitzrovia Cultural Centre in London. Residing at the George Washington Hotel on Lexington Ave. in New York, in 1994, he founded the Mondrian Fan Club with Adam Nankervis as vice-president. Between 1 January 1995 and 14 February 1995 David Medalla rented a space at 55 Gee Street, London, where he lived and exhibited. He exhibited seven new versions of his biokinetic constructions of the sixties (bubble machines; and a monumental sand machine). These machines were constructed from Medalla's original designs, by the English artist Dan Chadwick. The exhibition also featured large-scale prints of his New York 'Mondrian Events' with Adam Nankervis, and five large oil paintings on canvas created by David Medalla in situ at 55 Gee Street. Another important feature was a monumental animated neon relief entitled 'Kinetic Mudras for Piet Mondrian' constructed by Frances Basham using argon and neon lighting after Medalla's original idea and designs.http://www.iniva.org/archive/project/157 Medalla also invited artists to perform at the space. David Medalla has lectured extensively including at the Sorbonne, the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, the Museum of Modern Art of New York, Silliman University and the University of the Philippines, the Universities of Amsterdam and Utrecht, the New York Public Library, Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada, the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Canterbury, Warwick and Southampton in England, the Slade School of Fine Art, St. Martin's. He was the founder and director of the London Biennale in 1998, a “do-it-yourself” free arts festival, which hosts work by Mai Ghoussoub, Mark McGowan, Deej Fabyc, Marko Stepanov, Adam Nankervis, James Moores, Dimitri Launder, Fritz Stolberg, Salih Kayra, Marisol Cavia, and many others. In 2010 David Medalla participated in a residency in Brazil and - in collaboration with Adam Nankervis - exhibited at the show “The Secret History of Mondrian Fanclub - Homage to Hélio Oiticica, Lygia Pape and Lygia Clark”, curated by Adriano Casanova at Baro Galeria. During this period he also produced the artwork Cosmic Pandora Micro-Box, published in 2018 in the book by James Cahill \\"Flying Too Close to the Sun: Myths in Art from Classical to Contemporary\\", Phaidon.

It defines interfaces between modules that enable software from multiple vendors to be integrated together to provide a biometrics application within a system, or between one or more systems using a defined Biometric Interworking Protocol (BIP) – see below. Biometrics (measurements of physical characteristics of a person) are increasingly being used to provide verification of the identity of an individual, once they have been enrolled (one or more of their physical characteristics has been measured). Computer systems that perform biometric enrollment, verification, or identification are becoming increasingly used. The BioAPI specification enables such systems to be produced by the integration of modules from multiple independent vendors. Origins The BioAPI specification is one of a set of International Standards produced jointly by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) under their Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC1), Subcommittee 37 on Biometrics. The Standard was based on some early work done in the United States of America and by the BioAPI Consortium which was called BioAPI 1.0 and BioAPI 1.1, but these specifications were revised and extended when the work was introduced to ISO/IEC. The first international version was therefore called BioAPI 2.0. A subsequent international version of BioAPI containing extensions of the user interface-related features and other enhancements produced a BioApi 2.1. Further enhancements to BioAPI are expected. BioAPI 2.0 is specified in ISO/IEC 19784-1 and was first published on 1 May 2006. What and why? The purpose of the BioAPI specification is to define an architecture and all necessary interfaces (using C programming language specifications) to allow biometric applications (perhaps distributed across a network) to be integrated from modules provided by different vendors. The ability for system integrators to produce complete systems using components from multiple vendors is essential in the rapidly changing technology of biometrics. It gives flexibility in the provision of modules, avoids vendor lock-in, provides a degree of future-proofing as the best available biometrics technologies change. The modules being integrated may be software components containing capture devices, such as fingerprint readers, cameras for face recognition, iris scanners, signature recognition devices, vascular imaging systems, etc. They can also be modules that provide support for image processing of biometric data, feature extraction (a form of compression that is specific to a given biometric technology and allows direct matching of the compressed formats – for example, the relative distances on the face of eyes, nose, mouth, or the number of ridges between identifiable ridge endings or ridge bifurcations). In addition, modules that provide archiving and retrieval of biometric records to support matching or searching for a match are also a recognised part of the BioAPI architecture. Applications can be concerned with personal identification (for example for credit cards), or with more specific areas such as identity card verification, checks for duplicate enrollment, passports, or physical access control in a commercial environment or for airport employees or merchant seamen wishing to go on-shore at their arrival port. Whilst today a system is commonly built using a single device for a single application, it is likely that in the long term many such applications will interact (securely, and via a network) with a common set of trusted devices (with various security policies and certificates). It is also expected that future biometrics applications will use multiple biometric modalities (for example, fingerprint, iris, and face), both to improve the accuracy of identification and to cope with people that are missing a finger, or have disability problems that prevent use of iris or face recognition. BioAPI supports all these use cases. The basic architecture The basic architecture of BioAPI 2.0 is illustrated in the figure at the top of this page. There are multiple possible (independent) biometric applications that interact with a BioAPI Framework, which in turn routes their messages to Biometric Service Providers (BSPs) that support the various biometric capture devices, image enhancement modules, feature extraction, matching, searching, etc. A later extension of the architecture introduces the concept of a Biometric Function Provider (BFP) and defines further lower-level interfaces between a BFP and a controlling BSP. This minimises the amount of software that a biometric device vendor needs to develop, allowing (other) software vendors to do most of the work of producing the BSP with an interface to the framework. Procurement issues The BioAPI Framework is the heart of BioAPI. Procurements of biometric systems need to consider the merits of basing their invitations-to-tender on systems conforming to the BioAPI Standard, which contain a BioAPI Framework module. The importance of this Framework module is recognised by the BioAPI Consortium, which identifies an implementation of this Framework from BioFoundry. Distributed systems It might be uncommon to find multiple biometric applications and multiple biometric devices on a single computer system, but the long-term aim of telebiometrics is to allow multiple biometrics applications on multiple systems on the Internet to interwork with multiple other systems that support biometrics devices. BioAPI has already laid the foundations for this, with its architecture. Another ISO/IEC JTC1/SC37 Standard – BioAPI Interworking Protocol (BIP) – specifies an enhancement of the BioAPI Framework that essentially maps all API calls into network messages (defined using ASN.1) to provide a distributed BioAPI system. BIP is also being progressed as a Recommendation in ITU-T as Joint text with ISO/IEC.

He was the father of the hymn-writer and poet Frances Ridley Havergal and the clergyman and organist Henry East Havergal (1820–1875). Havergal was born in High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire and educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood and St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he gained a BA in 1815 and an MA in 1819. He was ordained deacon in 1816 and priest in 1817, and became rector of Astley in Worcestershire in 1829, St. Nicholas, Worcester in 1842, and perpetual curate of Shareshill near Wolverhampton in 1860. He died at Leamington Spa, Warwickshire and is buried at Astley. Early life Havergal, only son of William Havergal, who died 2 September 1854, by Mary, daughter of Thomas Hopkins, was born at Chipping Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on 18 January 1793; commenced his education at Princes Risborough in 1801, and entered the Merchant Taylors' School in July 1806. During his holidays he cultivated music, and from the age of fourteen often played the organ in his parish church. He was originally intended for the medical profession, but eventually went to Oxford, matriculating from St Edmund Hall on 10 July 1812. He graduated BA 1816, MA 1819, and was ordained 24 March 1816. He became an assistant curate under Thomas Tregenna Biddulph, at the churches of St. James, Bristol, and Creech Heathfield. In June 1820 he became curate in charge of Coaley, Gloucestershire, and lecturer of Dursley, and took pupils. On 25 June 1822 he became curate of Astley, Worcestershire. He visited Cornwall and Yorkshire in 1826 and two following years as a deputation from the Church Missionary Society. Music On 14 June 1829 he was thrown out of a carriage and received concussion of the brain, which disabled him for some years. He found relief in music. His first public composition was an anthem-like setting of Heber's From Greenland's Icy Mountains, the proceeds of which (180l.) he devoted to the Church Missionary Society. In 1836 appeared Op. 36, An Evening Service in E flat and One Hundred Antiphonal Chants. One of these, a Recte et Retro chant in C, sometimes called Worcester chant, became very widely known. In the same year the Gresham prize medal was awarded him for an Evening Service in A, Op. 37. In 1841 a second medal was gained by an anthem, Give Thanks, Op. 40. He became well known by his exertions for the restoration of metrical psalmody to its original purity. He published in 1844 a reprint of Thomas Ravenscroft's scarce work, \\"The Whole Booke of Psalmes\\". In 1847 he brought out the \\"Old Church Psalmody\\", Op. 43, which is the parent of most modern collections of church hymn tunes. \\"A Hundred Psalm and Hymn Tunes\\", Op. 48, entirely his own composition, was published in 1859. Handel and Corelli were his models, and his aim was to preserve purity of style. He also wrote songs, rounds, and catches for the young, besides carols, hymns, and sacred songs, for which he composed both words and music. Many of the sacred songs and carols appeared in the earlier volumes of \\"Our Own Fireside\\", and were republished under the title of \\"Fireside Music\\". His sacred song Summer Tide is Coming and his psalm tune \\"Evan\\" are widely known. On 13 November 1829 he was presented to the rectory of Astley, whence he removed in June 1845 to St. Nicholas rectory, Worcester, and was soon after appointed an honorary canon of Worcester Cathedral. He all but lost his sight in 1832, and it was never entirely restored. For a long time he could not read printed music or decipher his own handwriting. Final years and death Astley, Worcestershire, St Peter's Church: grave of Frances Ridley Havergal (1836–1879), and of her father William Henry Havergal (1793–1870) Through weakened health in March 1860 he resigned St. Nicholas and was presented to the country vicarage of Shareshill, near Wolverhampton. In 1867 increasing infirmities forced him to lay aside all regular parish work and remove to Leamington, where, with the exception of visits to the continent, he continued to reside. He died at Pyrmont Villa, Binswood Terrace, Leamington, on 19 April 1870, and was buried at Astley on 23 April. Legacy Havergal was the author of: # A Good and Satisfied Old Age. Some account of George Vaughan, a sermon, 1847. # Death for Murder, the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, 1849. # Sermons, chiefly on Historical Subjects, from the Old and New Testament, 1853, 2 vols. # A History of the Old Hundredth Psalm Tune, with specimens, 1854; in which work he attempted to prove that William Franc was the composer. # A Wise and Holy Child.

Available on Google Books. # Pyrmont, an eligible place for English patients who require chalybeate or saline waters, edited by Mrs. C. A. Havergal, 1871. He also wrote, selected, harmonised, and arranged, upwards of thirty works and pieces of music. Wives and children He married (1), 2 May 1816, Jane, fifth daughter of William Head of East Grinstead—she died 5 July 1848; and (2), on 29 July 1851, Caroline Ann, daughter of John Cooke of Gloucester—she died 26 May 1878. His children, Henry East Havergal, Francis Tebbs Havergal and Frances Ridley Havergal, are separately noticed. Another daughter, Maria Vernon Graham Havergal, who died 22 June 1887, wrote several books, and an autobiography which was edited by her sister, Jane Miriam Havergal, who married, October 1842, Henry Crane. Mrs. Crane also published records of her father's life.

He was an Islamologist, an Arabist and a disciple of the Orientalist Louis Massignon and of philosopher Louis Gardet. A Maronite priest, Moubarac dedicated his life and major works to interfaith dialogue between Christianity and Islam, to Arab and Lebanese causes, to the unity of the Church and to the Maronite Church Antiochian heritage. Biography Youakim Moubarac was born in Kfarsghab, Zgharta, Lebanon in a Maronite family of long sacerdotal tradition. His Father, Antoun, and Grandfather, Youssef, were Maronite priests serving their community in one of the holiest locations of the Eastern Christianity in the Middle East, the Qadisha Valley. His maternal grandfather Nemtallah Samia was also a priest. =Early life= After ecclesiastic studies in the Maronite Seminary of Ghazir and the Université Saint-Joseph, Beirut, Lebanon, young Youakim was sent in October 1945 to France by his superiors. Once his studies ended in the Seminary of Saint Sulpice, Paris, he was ordained priest on June 29, 1947 in Lebanon. In 1948, he was authorized by the Maronite Patriarch to continue his studies at the Institut Catholique de Paris. In that same year, he is appointed at the service of the Church of Saint Séverin in the Quartier Latin, Paris where he stayed for 18 years. =Expanded description= In 1951, he presented his first Ph.D. thesis Abraham dans le CoranMoubarac, Youakim (1958), Abraham dans le Coran, Editions Vrin, Paris. and joined as a researcher the Centre national de la recherche scientifique, the largest public research organization in France. From 1950 till 1962, Fr. Moubarac assumed the secretariat of Louis Massignon. In 1959, he started his academic career, teaching Classical Arabic at the Institut Catholique de Paris. Till his death, he taught in several universities such as the Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium, the University of Paris IV: Paris-Sorbonne and others. He participated between 1962 and 1965 in the Second Vatican Council within the Maronite delegation. After 1965, he dedicated himself to his work of promotion of the Interfaith dialogue, of defense of the Palestinian and especially Lebanese causes from 1975. From 1985, Father Youakim worked on the rediscovering of the spiritual Syriac roots of the Maronite Church. Between 1987 and 1992, he settled in Lebanon and was in charge of preparing for a Maronite Synod.the Maronite Patriarchal Synod Official Website During this period, and despite an intensive work on the Synod preparation and many spiritual and political missions, Moubarac started two important projects: * In 1989, he started the restoration of the Monastery of Our Lady of Qannoubine, a historical Maronite Monastery in the Qadisha valley which was for centuries the See of the Maronite Patriarch (ca. 15th to 18th Century). * In 1992, he founded with some friends, The Lebanese Cooperative for Development, a microcredit initiative, whose objectives were to encourage the displaced families during the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990) to settle back in their region of origin and to prevent emigration outside Lebanon. In 1991, the decision of Pope John Paul II to convene a Synod in Rome for all Catholic Lebanese Churches cancelled his project. In 1992, he settled back in Paris where he resumed his academic work. =Death and afterward= Father Youakim died on May 24, 1995 in Montpellier, France. His burial took place at the graveyard of the Abbaye Notre-Dame-de-Jouarre, France. Fourteen years later, on August 25, 2009, his remains were transferred, according to his wish, to rest beside his relatives in Mar Youssef Church in Morh Kfarsghab. A solemn mass of requiem, in his home town of Kfarsghab was presided by the Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir, honored by the presence of the Minister of Information, M. Tarek Mitri representing the President of the Lebanese Republic, General Michel Suleiman, the family and friends.

A ferocious Tyrannosaurus rex named Arnie charges on set and is about to devour a young doe named Barbara when suddenly, he removes his false teeth and lets the doe go out of sympathy. Gumby as a director cuts the scene and questions Arnie on his hesitation to act ferocious. Although Arnie knows it is all just acting, he feels unfit for the part because it just isn't him. He explains that he once was ferocious, but thanks to the influence of George Pal, he has reformed and is now a vegetarian without a bad bone in his body. Gumby fails to understand the profound effect of George Pal on Arnie's persona, so Arnie and Pokey show Gumby a set of George Pal shorts to show him the significance of the artist, thus starting The Puppetoon Movie. A number of George Pal's short films are featured in the film: *The Little Broadcast *Philips Broadcast of 1938 *Hoola Boola *South Sea Sweethearts *The Sleeping Beauty *Tulips Shall Grow° *Together in the Weather *John Henry and the Inky- Poo ° *Philips Cavalcade *Jasper in a Jam *Tubby the Tuba° °Oscar nominated film After all the shorts, Gumby and the others meet other characters who George Pal animated, such as the Pillsbury Doughboy and the Alka-Seltzer mascot Speedy. Gumby then thanks George Pal for making all this possible, and everybody cheers. The screen pans out and shows a gremlin, who looks at the audience, says \\"George Pal!\\" in a raspy voice, then climbs up a support beam while laughing hysterically. Home Video In addition to the film shorts listed above, the following Pal film shorts are also included in the 2000 DVD edition from Image Entertainment and the 2013 Blu-ray edition from B2MP: What Ho She Bumps, Mr. Strauss Takes a Walk, Olio for Jasper, Philips Cavalcade, Jasper's Derby, Hoola Boola, Ether Symphony, Aladdin and the Magic Lamp, The Magic Atlas, Jasper and the Haunted House, Philips Broadcast of 1938, and The Ship of the Ether.

Largely river navigation, there were numerous lock cuts, to accommodate the 12 broad locks built along its length, many of which were built at sites where it was necessary to maintain the water levels for an adjacent mill. With railway competition, and the closure of the Oakham Canal, to which it was connected, decline was rapid, and the canal closed in 1877. Two hundred years after it was opened, the Melton & Oakham Waterways Society was formed, with the aim of returning the navigation to a navigable waterway once more. History The first proposals to link Melton Mowbray to the canal network were made in 1780, following on from the success achieved by the Loughborough Navigation and the Erewash Canal. The intent was to make the River Soar navigable to Leicester, and the River Wreake navigable to Melton. Although nothing came of these first proposals, public meetings were held in 1785, and the civil engineer William Jessop surveyed the route in October. Around £6,000 was subscribed to fund the scheme, and thoughts of upgrading the River Eye to enable boats to reach Oakham, and of cutting a canal to Stamford were also voiced. When the opportunity came to submit the bill to Parliament in March 1786, two bills were submitted, one for the Soar from Loughborough to Leicester, and a second for the Soar from Loughborough to the mouth of the Wreake, and up the Wreake to Melton. The main Soar bill was defeated, and the Wreake bill was shelved. A single bill combining both of the previous two plans was submitted in 1789, but was again defeated, due to opposition from the Leicestershire coalfields. The proponents worked hard to win over those opposing the scheme, which was split into two again, and both bills were re- submitted in early 1791. The Leicester Navigation bill faced limited opposition, but was granted on 13 May 1791, while the Melton Mowbray Navigation faced no opposition, and was authorised by its act of Parliament on 6 June 1791. The act allowed the proprietors to raise £25,000 by issuing shares, with an additional £5,000 if required. Many of the shareholders lived locally, though there were some from further afield. William Jessop's assistant, Christopher Staveley had drawn up the detailed plans, which included details of the lock sites and cuts necessary to build them, together with sites where the river would be straightened to aid navigation. Ten mills were in operation at the time, and so that determined the location and fall of ten of the locks. Although the plans showed lock cuts with a lock at the upper end of the cut, they were moved to the lower end, as Jessop's work on the River Thames had shown that this arrangement tended to prevent the formation of a bar or shoal where the lock cut rejoined the river. Work began soon after the award of the act, with Staveley employed as engineer, although there are few details of the construction, as the company records have not survived. The first section, from the Soar to Frisby Mill, was opened in November 1794. The canal was built during the time of the French Wars, and inflation was a problem, resulting in costs over-running. In March 1795, a special meeting was held to consider how to raise more money, while in July, Staveley was 'voted out', to be replaced by William Green, who had been involved in the construction of the Grantham Canal. Although he declared that the workmanship and the materials used were very bad, he completed the work and the navigation was open by 1797. A second act of Parliament was obtained to resolve a number of financial issues, and it seems that the total cost of the project was around £45,000. The navigation was long, with twelve broad locks, which raise the canal by between the Soar and Melton. Operation The canal served a mainly rural area, and traffic levels reflected this. The population of Melton Mowbray was recorded as 1730 in the census of 1801. The main cargoes were coal, supplemented by barley, oats and wheat, granite, lime, wool and manure. Coal traffic amounted to 16,781 tons in 1797, although of this, 77 per cent was carried up the canal, and the rest was carried down the canal, so it appears that coal was resold to the Leicester market when prices fluctuated. The Oakham Canal, when it opened in 1802, was never a success financially, but generated extra traffic for the Melton Mowbray Navigation, with around half of the coal passing up the canal continuing on to Oakham, and agricultural produce passing down on its way to Leicester. The main wharves were at Melton Basin and Rearsby, although the figures for the period between 1839 and 1842 record nine other wharves, although the precise location of most of them is conjectural. In Melton itself, new wharves were built, which provided warehousing, a granary, a coal yard and malt offices, to the west of the main basin. Dividends on the shares gradually increased, reaching 7.5 per cent in 1809, and 10 per cent in 1821, where they remained for the next 20 years. Income from tolls exceeded £4,000 per year in the 1830s. Cargoes benefited from the connection at Syston to the very successful Leicester Navigation. Decline The Oakham canal had never been so profitable, paying dividends of around 3.8 per cent, and lack of water during the dry summer of 1844 resulted in it closing for five months. When the Midland Railway sought to build their Syston and Peterborough Railway, the Oakham company negotiated, and the railway bought the canal on 29 October 1847, with a view to closing it and using part of the bed for their line. The effect on the Melton Mowbray Navigation was dramatic. 1847 was its best year, for it carried 68,896 tons, of which 39,451 proceeded on to the Oakham canal. With the Oakham closed, traffic for the following year was less than half, at 30,879 tons, and had dropped to just 13,301 tons in 1850. Income fell even faster, from £4,830 in 1847 to £415 in 1849. The Canal company attempted to sell the waterway to the Loughborough Navigation in the 1860s, and then to the Midland Railway Company, but neither were interested. It struggled on until closure on 1 August 1877. The act of Abandonment required the structures of the canal to be put into good order before they were abandoned, and this process was overseen by the engineer A.W. Dalton. Crescent shaped weirs were built in place of the upper lock gates, and some of the bridges were lowered while others were rebuilt. The towpaths, which were rented from the owners of the banks, reverted to their owners. Restoration Restoration of the navigation and the Oakham Canal was first proposed by the Leicester Branch of the Inland Waterways Association in 1997, and this led to the formation of the Melton & Oakham Waterways Society. Very few bridges have been lowered (the principal one being Lewin Bridge, which carries the Fosse Way at Syston), and most lock chambers are still extant though in need of repair. A slipway has been built in Melton Mowbray by Waterway Recovery Group volunteers, some dredging and towpath repairs undertaken, and the society has worked with the Sustrans Connect2 project to replace the entrance footbridge at Syston with one offering navigable headroom. Sustrans were awarded £50 million by the People's Lottery Fund in 2008, to fund 79 projects, of which the bridge replacement was one. Work began on the new bridge, which will provide of headroom, in late 2012, following lengthy discussions between the society, Sustrans, Leicestershire County Council and British Waterways. Once completed, Syston Lock will need to be refurbished to open up the first of the waterway to Lewin Bridge and the Gate Hangs Well public house.

Giovanni della Robbia (1469–1529) was an Italian Renaissance ceramic artist. Biography Giovanni della Robbia was the son of Andrea della Robbia (1435–1525), brother of Girolamo della Robbia (1488–1566) and grandnephew of Luca della Robbia (1399/1400–1482). During a great part of his life he worked as assistant to his father and inherited the workshop after his father's death, enhancing the polychrome character of the ceramic glaze works. In many cases the enamelled sculpture of the two were difficult to distinguish, and a very large number of pieces of Robbia-ware which were attributed to Andrea, and even to Andrea’s uncle Luca, were really by the hand of Giovanni. Neither Luca nor Andrea was in the habit of signing his work, but Giovanni often did so, usually adding the date, probably because other potters had begun to imitate the Robbia ware. Examples of these imitations are a retable in the Basilica of San Lucchese near Poggibonsi dated 1514, another of the Madonna and Saints at Monte San Savino of 1525, and a third in the Capuchin church of Arceria near Senigallia. Some of them may have been made by assistants trained in the Robbia workshops. Pietà, c. 1510-1520, National Gallery of Art One of his finest works is a large retable at Volterra in the church of San Girolamo, dated 1501; it represents the Last Judgment, and is remarkable for the fine modelling of the figures, especially that of the archangel Michael, and a nude kneeling figure of a youth who has just risen from his tomb. Another work that equalled that anything of his father's, from whom the design of the figures was probably taken, is the washings fountain in the sacristy of the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella at Florence, made in 1497. It is a large arched recess with a view of the seashore painted on maiolica tiles at the back. There are also two painted maiolica panels of fruit trees let into the lower part. In the tympanum of the arch is a white relief of the Madonna between two adoring angels. Long coloured garlands of fruit and flowers are held by nude boys reclining on the top of the arch and others standing on the cornice. All this part is of enamelled clay, but the basin of the fountain is of white marble. Giovanni not only copied the work of Luca and Andrea, but even reproduced in clay the marble sculpture of Antonio del Pollaiolo, Da Settignano, Verrocchio and others. A relief by him, evidently taken from Mino da Fiesole, exists in the Palazzo Castracane Staccoli. Among the numerous other works of Giovanni are a relief in the wall of a suppressed convent in the Via Nazionale at Florence, and two reliefs in the Bargello dated 1521 and 1522. That dated 1521 is a many-coloured relief of the Nativity, and was taken from the church of San Girolamo in Florence. Its predella has a small relief of the Adoration of the Magi, and is inscribed “Hoc opus fecit Ioaes Andee de Robia, ac a posuit hoc in tempore die ultima lulli ANO. DNI. M.D. XXI.” At Pisa in the Campo Santo is a relief in Giovanni's later manner dated 1520; it is a Madonna surrounded by angels, with saints below the whole overcrowded with figures and ornaments. Frieze at Ospedale Del Ceppo, detailGiovanni's largest and perhaps finest work is the polychromatic frieze on the outside of the Ospedale del Ceppo hospital at Pistoia (itself begun in 1514), for which he received various sums of money between 1525 and 1529, as is recorded in documents which still exist among the archives of the hospital. The subjects of this frieze are the Seven Works of Mercy, forming a continuous band of sculpture in high relief, designed in a very broad sculpturesque way, but with somewhat crude colouring. Six of these reliefs are by Giovanni, namely, Clothing the Naked, Washing the Feet of Pilgrims, Visiting the Sick, Visiting Prisoners, Burying the Dead, and Feeding the Hungry. The seventh, Giving drink to the Thirsty, was made by Filippo Paladini of Pistoia in 1585; this last is simply made of painted stucco. The large figures of the virtues placed between the scenes, and the medallions between the pillars, are the work of assistants or imitators. A large octagonal font of enamelled clay, with pilasters at the angles and panels between them with scenes from the life of John the Baptist, in the church of San Leonardo at Cerreto Guidi, is a work of the school of Giovanni; the reliefs are pictorial in style and coarse in execution. Giovanni's chief pupil was a man named Benedetto Buglioni (1461–1521), and his nephew Santi Buglioni (b. 1494), entered the Robbia workshops in 1521, and assisted in the later works of Giovanni.

Esteban Huertas López (1876–1943) was a Colombian and later Panamanian military commander. He was born in Boyacá, Colombia. When he was 8 years old he ran away from home to join the army. Fighting in the civil war, he won many medals. In 1900 he lost his left arm when he fired a cannon. It was replaced by a wooden prosthesis. In 1902 he was promoted to the rank of general. Manuel Amador Guerrero managed to get Huertas on his side by spreading rumours that he would lose his title and be sent to the dangerous inlands of Colombia. In 1903 he took part in the revolution that led Panama to independence. On October 28, 1904 Huertas demanded two ministers from Amador's conservative cabinet resign. Fearing a coup, Amador disbanded the army and Huertas had to resign. Huertas died in Panama City in 1943.  Appearance in fiction  Huertas is portrayed as \\"General Esteban\\" in The Sharpie of the Culebra Cut, a Scrooge McDuck comic by Keno Don Rosa that is set in Panama in 1906. In the comic, General Esteban is a villain who wants to seize power in Panama to enrich himself using the Panama Canal (which he plans to rename Esteban Canal, and it would make him one of the most powerful and richest dictators in the world). As Rosa could find no real life Colombian or Panamanian villains, he based the villain off Huertas but only named him \\"General Esteban\\" to try to make a different, fictional character. After great treasure discovered by Scrooge McDuck and Teddy Roosevelt, Esteban's visions of power grow even greater as he can hire mercenaries, build armaments and even his own navy with the ancient gold.

Most of the area through which they run is at or below sea level, and attempts to protect it from inundation have been carried out since 1480. The Middle Level was given its name by the Dutch Engineer Cornelius Vermuyden in 1642, who subsequently constructed several drainage channels to make the area suitable for agriculture. Water levels were always managed to allow navigation, and Commissioners were established in 1754 to maintain the waterways and collect tolls from commercial traffic. A new main drain to Wiggenhall St Germans was completed in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, using one of the first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically in the early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971. As a result of the drainage, land levels continued to fall, and in 1934 the gravity outfall at Wiggenhall St Germans was replaced by a pumping station, with three diesel engines driving diameter pumps. Its capacity was increased in 1951, and again in 1969–70, when two of the engines were replaced by electric motors. Following over 50 hours of continuous running at maximum capacity in 1998, a new pumping station was commissioned. Work on it began in 2006, and when it was completed in 2010, it was the second largest pumping station in Europe. Much of the drainage of the Middle Levels relies on pumping, and the Commissioners manage over 100 pumping stations throughout the area. Interest in restoration of the Middle Levels for leisure traffic began in 1949, and the first significant work by volunteers occurred in 1972, when they worked on the restoration of Well Creek, which finally reopened in 1975. Since then, locks have been lengthened, to allow access by modern narrowboats, as they were built for Fen Lighters, which were only long. The southern reaches became more accessible in 2006, when a low Bailey bridge was raised by soldiers from the 39 Engineer Regiment. The system is managed by Commissioners, and they are the fourth largest navigation authority in Great Britain.  History  The Middle Levels of the Fens are a low-lying area of approximately , much of which is at or below sea level. Attempts to protect them from inundation and to make them suitable for agriculture began in 1480, when the Bishop of Ely, John Morton, constructed a straight cut from Stanground to Guyhirne. This provided the waters of the River Nene with a more direct route to the sea than the previous route through Benwick, Floods Ferry, March, Outwell and Wisbech. Morton's Leam, the name given to the medieval drainage ditch, was wide and deep, and much of the manual labour was provided by prisoners of war from the Hundred Years War. In 1605, Sir John Popham, who was the Lord Chief Justice at the time, began work on a drainage scheme near Upwell, and although the scheme was ultimately abandoned in 1608, Popham's Eau, his cut from the old course of the River Nene near March to the Well Creek at Nordelph remains. =Establishment= The next significant advance was in 1630, when the Dutch Engineer Cornelius Vermuyden was employed by the Earl of Bedford and others to drain the Fens. The Old Bedford River was cut from Earith to Salters Lode, a distance of , and provided sufficient drainage that the land could be used for summer grazing. Vermuyden published a document in 1642, entitled Discourse touching the draining of the Great Fennes, in which he proposed the division of the fens into three zones, the North Level, the South Level, and between them, the Middle Level, stretching from Morton's Leam to the Bedford River. An Act of Parliament, the Pretended Act, was obtained in 1649, and work began under his supervision. The New Bedford River was constructed, running parallel to the Old, and the Middle Levels area was protected. The Forty Foot, Twenty Foot and Sixteen Foot Rivers were cut soon afterwards, to drain water from the area to Salters Lode and Welches Dam. In addition to these new channels, the Middle Level also contained of the old course of the Nene, and the ancient artificial waterways of King's Dyke and Whittlesey Dyke, which connect Stanground to Floods Ferry. To the north is Well Creek, most of which was a natural waterway, although the final section to Salters Lode Lock follows the course of the New Podyke, a drainage channel constructed in the early sixteenth century. The primary function of the waterways was drainage, but water levels were managed to enable them to be navigated. The volumes of traffic carried are not well documented, especially in the early period. Within the level, there were four large lakes or meres, of which the biggest was Whittlesey Mere. It was used for leisure boating, and was described by Celia Fiennes in 1697, who stated that it was long and wide, and noted that it was sometimes dangerous, since it was prone to sudden winds rising up 'like hurricanes'. In order to maintain and improve the route between Salters Lode Sluice on the Great Ouse and Stanground Sluice on the River Nene, another Act of Parliament was obtained in 1754. This created Commissioners to manage the waterways, with powers to charge 3d per ton on goods entering the system through either of the sluices. Agricultural produce was carried through Salters Lode, bound for Kings Lynn, while coal, timber and groceries moved in the opposite direction. Pleasure boats were specifically excluded from paying tolls, as were certain products including manure, compost, malt dust, pigeons' dung and some varieties of oil cake. Another account of the system is provided by George Walpole's Journal of the Voyage round the Fens in 1774, which was made in a fleet of nine boats, all of which were towed by a single horse called Hippopotamus when there was insufficient wind for sailing. Carpenters were employed to jack up or remove bridges which were too low for the boats to pass, and although the expedition lasted for 22 days, Walpole only recorded one gang of lighters, which delayed them as Salters Lode. The system was enhanced in 1796 by the opening of the Wisbech Canal, which linked the Well Creek at Outwell to the River Nene at Wisbech. It followed the line of the Wellstream, another ancient waterway. At Outwell the Well Creek is also joined by the old course of the River Nene. =Development= A new Act of Parliament was obtained in 1810, as the 1754 Act did not make sufficient provision for the funding of drainage works, and in some cases ensured that flood relief could not be given until the land had flooded. The new Act transferred responsibility from the Bedford Level Corporation to local Commissioners, who had to be land-owners. They had powers to charge a levy on all land which could be taxed under the Eau Brink Acts. Between 1824 and 1839, John Dyson Jr was employed as the resident engineer by the Bedford Level Commissioners. He had been recommended by John Rennie, and was charged with the reconstruction of ten locks and sluices, together with \\"a great many other works of great importance\\", for which the estimated cost was between £50,000 and £60,000. The work included the rebuilding of Salters Lode sluice, which Dyson oversaw himself, as no suitable tenders were received when the work was advertised. It was completed by 1832. Sluices and bridges at Stanground, Welches Dam, and the end of the Old Bedford River, near Salters Lode, were also rebuilt. Moorings on the Old River Nene at March As the land dried, the peaty soils shrank, causing the land surface to drop. Much of the Middle Levels was flooded in 1841–42, and this led the Commissioners to obtain an Act of Parliament in 1844, which authorised the construction of a new main drain, long, in order that water could flow by gravity to Wiggenhall St Germans, where the levels of the tidal river were about lower than at Salters Lode. The work was completed in 1848, and the sluice at Marmount Priory was also built at this time, in order to allow boats with a deeper draught to navigate through Upwell and Outwell. A railway line from to passed through the port of March from 1846, which soon became a railway hub, with branch lines to Wisbech and St Ives. Traffic transferred from the waterways, which made the drainage responsibilities of the Commissioners easier. The new main drain enabled Whittlesey Mere to be drained. A pumping station with an Appold centrifugal pump was used to achieve this, rather than the more traditional scoop wheel. The pump had been shown for the first time at the Great Exhibition in 1851, where it amazed visitors, and its inventor was commissioned to design a pump for the draining of the mere. It was in diameter, and powered by a steam engine, could raise 101 tons of water per minute by . In 1862 an Act of Parliament created the Middle Level Commissioners as a separate body to the Bedford Level Corporation, although they had been almost independent since 1810, and they embarked on a series of improvements. Drainage was always the primary function, but navigation was also important, and the new body had powers to charge tolls for the use of the waterways. 1862 was also the year in which the Wiggenhall sluice collapsed and around of the levels were flooded. Sir John Hawkshaw constructed a new sluice, consisting of a large cofferdam, with 16 tubes, each in diameter, which passed over the top of it. The tops of these pipes were above the inlet and outlet, and an air pump was used to remove the air from them, so that the water would syphon over the cofferdam. It was the only time that such a solution was tried in the Fens, and it was supplemented in 1880 by a more conventional gravity sluice, also constructed by Hawkshaw, as it was unable to discharge sufficient water. Some commercial traffic on the waterways continued despite the railway competition, with 44,034 tons generating £733 of tolls in 1888, which enabled the Commissioners to show a profit of £216. Traffic had fallen slightly to 42,640 tons in 1898, but by 1905 was down to 12,770 tons, and the Commissioners showed a loss of £702 that year. An Alderman giving evidence to the Royal Commission on Canals and Waterways in 1905 pointed out that one of the railway companies had been paying to collect traffic in hay and straw, although this practice ceased when it became public knowledge. The condition of the Nene and the Wisbech Canal declined, which discouraged navigation, but some trade in agricultural produce, coal, bricks and road building materials continued. Coal was delivered by barge from Outwell Depot to around 40 pumping stations. There were a few regular carriers left by the 1920s, one of whom ran Jackson's Navy, using horses to tow the barges, and steam tugs after 1930. When the company stopped trading in 1948, sugar beet traffic was carried to Ely in boats owned by the beet factory for another ten years. Fuel oil for the pumping stations was supplied by the tanker barge Shellfen until 1971, by which time the Well Creek was almost impassible. = Pumping stations = The new pumping station at Wiggenhall St Germans pumps the Middle Levels main drain. It was commissioned in 2010, and the pumps are visible through the glass wall that forms the front of the building. The effect of drainage on the light peaty soils was that further shrinkage occurred, and land levels continued to fall. By the late 1920s, gravity discharge alone could no longer be relied upon to provide an adequate level of flood protection, and a change to pumped drainage began. A new sluice and pumping station were constructed at St Germans, which was completed in 1934. The sluice was built in the centre of the old syphon sluice channel, with a pumping station on either side of it. Three pump sets were installed, with space for a fourth. Each consisted of a Crossley diesel engine coupled to an Gwynnes pump, which could pump 840 tons per minute, or 1,234 megalitres per day (Ml/d). Once completed, the syphon sluice was demolished, while Hawkshaw's replacement sluice and its channel were abandoned. The new works were paid for by a grant, given on condition that three quarters of the workforce were from the local area. The capacity of the station was increased in 1951, when a Crossley diesel engine was fitted into the spare bay, and again in 1969–70, when the two pumps on the north side of the sluice were rebuilt, and the engines replaced by electric motors. From 1977 to 1983, a series of improvements were carried out, which included the construction of a pumping station at Tebbits Bridge on Bevills Leam, preventing navigation along this channel to the southern reaches of the Middle Levels. A new lock was constructed at Lodes End to provide an alternative route. The banks of the Old River Nene were raised and clay puddling was used to retain the water, and major improvements to the Forty Foot, Twenty Foot and Sixteen Foot rivers were made, to maintain water levels for navigation. All of the bridges on the Sixteen Foot River were demolished and replaced to provide wider channels, as their width restricted flows during heavy rainfall, and St Germans pumping station was again upgraded, when the remaining 1934 engine was replaced by a Allen diesel engine. The improvements have restricted navigation in the lower south-western area, but greatly improved flood defences. The Tebbitt's Bridge pumping station houses six Allen diameter pumps, each capable of pumping 260 Ml/d. Three of them are powered by electric induction motors, manufactured by Lawrence Scott, which are controlled automatically, while the other three are powered by Dorman diesel engines, which are controlled manually. There is a standby generator, to cope with loss of the electric supply, and when all six pumps are operational, the station can pump 1,586 Ml/d, equivalent to 18 tonnes per second. In April 1998, the St Germans pumping station ran at maximum capacity, which was 6,134 Ml/d (or 71 tonnes per second), for over 50 hours, and this led to the decision to replace it with a brand new installation, with 40% extra capacity. Work started in December 2006, and the pumping station, which is the second largest in Europe, includes a glass wall to enable visitors to see the pumps. The new station was commissioned on 22 April 2010, after which the old station was demolished. A formal opening ceremony was held on 20 April 2011, when the station was opened by Lord James Russell, brother of the Duke of Bedford, and a descendant of the Earl of Bedford who started the process of draining the Fens in the seventeenth century. There are more than one hundred smaller pumping stations scattered throughout the system to maintain the water levels and prevent flooding. =Restoration= Salters Lode Lock, at the end of Well Creek, showing the two sets of gates pointing in opposite directions Local interest in restoring the Middle Levels for navigation began to develop in 1949. The Fenlands Branch of the Inland Waterways Association was formed on 30 October 1949, and following assurances from the Ouse Catchment Board that they were planning to restore the river for navigation up to Bedford, the branch decided to devote their energies to the Middle Levels, which were weedy and heavily silted. Salters Lode lock was rebuilt in 1963, but passage along Well Creek was very difficult. The East Anglian Waterways Association and the Middle Level Watermans Club began campaigning for it to be dredged in 1964. The first major working party by volunteers on the system occurred in 1972, when the Well Creek Trust organised a project called 'Fenatic' in October, which involved draining the creek so that it could be cleared of rubbish. It was reopened for traffic in 1975. When the navigations were built, the boats using them were traditional Fen Lighters, which were , and the locks were sized accordingly. However, there has been a programme to increase the lock sizes to make the waterways accessible to standard narrow boats. Lodes End lock was when built. The lock at Marmount Priory was extended to , Ashline lock to , Stanground to , and Horseway to . with the new Ashline lock being reopened on 1 April 1999. Salter's Lode lock has three sets of gates, with a guillotine gate at the tidal end, and mitre gates which allow boats up to long to enter the River Ouse when the river level is higher than the level of Well Creek. It was possible for longer boats to pass straight through at certain states of the tide, but the lock has been lengthened to , by the addition of a third set of mitre gates, facing away from the river, which can only be used when the level of the river is lower than that of the Creek. Welches Dam Lock is still sized for Fen Lighters, at just long. Access to the southern reaches of the Levels was improved in 2006, when soldiers from the 53rd Field Squadron of the 39 Engineer Regiment raised the level of a Bailey bridge at Ramsey Hollow. This had previously restricted passage, as it was very low, but the exercise increased the headroom by . The Inland Waterways Association raised the funding for the additional materials required, and the reconstruction opened up a cruising ring on the Levels.  Today  Passage on the Middle Level Navigations can be difficult. This was on Vermuyden's Drain between Horseway Lock and Welches Dam Lock in 1997. The channel is now overgrown with reeds. The navigations are managed by the Middle Level Commissioners, who are responsible for about of waterway, of which around are navigable. The Commissioners are also responsible for six locks and a number of pumping stations, and are the fourth largest navigation authority in Great Britain. The navigations often form a short cut for boaters between the River Nene at Peterborough and the River Great Ouse at Salters Lode Lock. The suggested route passes through Stanground Sluice, along King's Dyke to Ashline Lock, and then along Whittlesey Dike to Flood's Ferry junction. From here the route is along the old course of the River Nene, passing through the twin villages of Outwell and Upwell, where the abandoned Wisbech Canal once formed a route back to the new course of the River Nene. The final stretch to Salters Lode lock is along Well Creek, passing over the top of the Middle Level Main Drain on Mullicourt Aqueduct. The alternative route via Horseway sluice and the Old Bedford River is unusable, as the lock at Welches Dam was declared unsafe and closed in 2006, and a reedbed has taken hold. Very low water levels between Horseway sluice and Welches Dam lock often prevented passage. This stands to be improved, however, as part of the Fens Waterways Link project, which includes plans for improving the route through the Middle Levels from Stanground to Salters Lode and to Welches Dam.

Designed as a collection of evidences and for studies, the museum has been founded in 1924 by Josef Anton Häfliger (1873–1954) and has been preserved until this day in its original form as a 'scientific cabinet'. The museum is one of the largest and most significant collections of pharmaceutical objects and the history of pharmacy. It contains pharmaceutical ceramics, complete furniture of historical pharmacies, an alchemical laboratory, mortars, historical first aid kits, books, medications used in the past, and everything that has to do with the fabrication of remedies.  History  The house »Zum Vorderen Sessel«, where the museum is situated, is located in the historic city centre of Basel, half way between the market square and St Peter's Church. It has first been mentioned in 1316 as bath house »Unter Krämern« and has always been a location of changeful history. From 1480, famous letterpress printer Johannes Amerbach lived there; he was the ancestor of the famous academic Amerbach family. In 1507, the house had been inherited by Johannes Frobenius, probably the most famous letterpress printer of his time. Erasmus von Rotterdam himself, being Froben's guest from 1514 until 1516, lived and worked there. The letterpress printers were joined by famous illustrators, such as Hans Holbein the Younger and his brother Ambrosius, and the engraver Urs Graf. In 1526 and 1527, the famous physician and alchemist Theophrastus von Hohenheim, who named himself Paracelsus, worked there; he had just moved to Basel and was Froben's family doctor. Since 1925, the house »Zum Sessel« hosts the Pharmacy Museum of the University of Basel.

Collection  The Pharmacy Museum dates back to a time when collecting of objects had still been an essential element of scientific teaching and research. It has its origins in the private collection of pharmacist and lector for practical pharmacy and history of pharmacy Josef Anton Häfliger (1873–1954). In 1924, he donated his collection of ancient apothecary vessels, obsolete drugs, prescriptions, woodcarvings, paintings and books to the University of Basel. Heinrich Zörnig, director of the 'Pharmazeutische Anstalt' (Department of Pharmacy) founded in 1917, provided several rooms to host the collection. Establishing the collection in the Department of Pharmacy, Häfliger was able to provide his students an approach to pharmaceutical practices across the historical process. Objects were used as teaching material for the intermediation of the history of pharmacy and the techniques of fabrication of remedies. The collection arose in direct connection with the historical development of pharmaceutical practice, hence in the first half of the 20th century the whole pharmaceutical sector - from research and production until the selling of remedies - was undergoing a profound transformation.  Exhibition  = Remedies, drugs and medications = View of the exhibition room »Materia medica obsoleta« View of the exhibition room about the industrial history of the 19th century Various aspects of diseases and illnesses, as well as various concepts of healing, are exemplified by a considerable collection of drugs and medications from all over the world. = Laboratories = Among the two historical laboratories in the collection, the alchemical laboratory with original exhibits from the 16th and 17th century is an evidence for the retrieval of the philosopher's stone. The pharmaceutical laboratory dating from the time around 1800 is designed for the manual preparation of medical plants. = Antique pharmacy interiors = Three antique pharmacy interiors illustrate the history of pharmacy through the ages: The luxuriantly decorated »Hofapotheke« (Court Pharmacy) from Innsbruck dates back to 1755. The pharmacy of the years around 1820 is designed in the classical style of the Empire. The transition to the era of industrialism is shown in the furniture of the former Basel »Barfüsser- Apotheke« (Barfüsser Pharmacy), designed just shortly before 1900. Nowadays it is placed in the entrance area of the museum and is therefore the furniture of the museum shop. = Faience = View of the pottery collection in the »Vasensaal« The museum shows a prominent collection of pharmaceutical pottery. The so-called Faience have been used as containers for basic materials and remedies in pharmacies since the 15th century.  Research  The Pharmacy Museum, as one of the two University Museums of Basel, is actively engaged in scientific research and teaching. There are courses in history of pharmacy, history of natural sciences and life sciences on a regular basis. Furthermore, the Pharmacy Museum promotes the scientific exploration of the history of pharmacy as well as research based on objects and collection.  Library  The Pharmacy Museum is the home of a scientific library, containing literature and information about pharmacy, about its related sciences and about its history. Moreover, it contains material whose collection had not been originally intended, such as drug compendiums, advertising brochures, price and tariff lists and so forth). Books and goods from the library can not be lent out, they have to be viewed and used on location. The use of the library is free of charge. The inventory is retrievable over the Swissbib catalogue: / Swissbib Katalog  Museum Shop – Shopping like one hundred years ago  Museum shop The museum shop is arranged in the historical furniture of the former »Barfüsser-Apotheke«.

Boys and girls were taught skills such as needlework and straw plaiting. The school was funded by donations, charity sermons and income from the children's handiwork. In 1808, with the support of local philanthropist and social reformer Sir Thomas Bernard the school moved to 82 Marylebone High Street, which is now a boutique store. Subsequently, to make room for growing numbers, it moved to a site on Paddington Street, which is identifiable today as a Mission Church. Then in 1858 the 5th Duke of Portland bought a plot of ground near the top of Marylebone High Street and covenanted the site to be used for a girls' school in perpetuity. The main site of the school has been there ever since. The Day School of Industry had been incorporated with Sir Thomas Bernard's school under the direction of the Governors of the Church of England's United National Schools. In 1858, it became known as Central National School, to distinguish it from the Eastern (now All Souls CE Primary) and Western National Schools (now St Mary's Bryanston Square CE Primary) founded in 1824 at nearby parishes. The boys' section was eventually closed and it became a girls' school, adopting its current name. In the 1960s-70s the school used a building in Penfold Street, about 15 minutes from the main site, for domestic science lessons; this building is now used by the Westminster Youth Service. In 2005, the sixth form moved to part of a building that had housed a convent; in 2008-9 this was demolished and rebuilt as a five-story, university-style Sixth Form Centre. During the school's grant-maintained period, it was highly selective and the school used to interview parents and prospective pupils. Between 2005 and 2010, the main site saw extensive building and refurbishment work. Major new facilities were opened in 2007, including a below-ground gymnasium and dance studios as well as a music recording studio space and a three-story visual and performing arts space. Since 2013, the school's studio has been the main filming spot for Spirit Young Performers Company. Popular videos shot at this location include \\"Little Miss High and Mighty\\" and \\"Hard Knock Life\\". Houses and local connections Historically, the school had four houses - Dickens, Barret, Hardwick and Wesley. In September 2010, a fifth house, Nightingale, was added and, in September 2017, a sixth house named after Ada Lovelace. The houses are named after these significant people as they have had some kind of connection with the school (e.g. Thomas Hardwick designed the St Marylebone Church). The houses have the following colours: blue (Barret), yellow (Dickens), red (Hardwick), green (Wesley), purple (Nightingale) and orange (Ada Lovelace). When joining the school, pupils are assigned to one of the houses. Academics It was designated a Specialist Arts College by the DfES in 1998, gaining a second specialism as a Mathematics and Computing College in 2006. The school offers a huge range of enrichment activities across the performing arts, and in 2012 was accredited a Gold Standard Arts Mark for the third time in succession. St Marylebone is also a Woodard School, part of a small family of state and independent church schools which prioritise pastoral care with academic excellence. From a failing school with only 26% of students achieving 5 A*-C GCSE grades, St Marylebone become the most improved school in 2007 as the percentage of *A-C GCSE grades rose to over 90% where it remained for ten years. The school states outstanding teaching is seen as the foundation of the school’s success. The school was named by the Mayor of London as first in its group of 56 similar schools and a member of the Mayor’s Gold Club. St Marylebone is now one of the outstanding academies, one of the original 100 teaching schools and has opened a free special school meeting the needs of pupils with speech language and communication needs. Mrs Phillips, who is a National Leader of Education, was appointed executive head teacher of the St Marylebone Academies Trust in 2010 and was chair of the Westminster Secondary Heads Forum, representing secondary headteachers on the 14-19 Executive Board. At the latest Ofsted inspection, St Marylebone was judged \\"outstanding in every respect\\". In 2013, exam results were the best in Westminster and the school topped the DfE League Table comparing all schools nationally with a similar intake. For the 11th year running, well over 90% of GCSE entries received A*-C grades and more than half received A* or A. St Marylebone is one of the most oversubscribed schools in London; in 2013, almost 7 students applied for each of the places available in Year 7. It is the top non- selective school in London. In September 2013, St Marylebone School opened an affiliate school, The St Marylebone Bridge School. The Bridge School is a co- educational Free Special School providing \\"an innovative education to students with statements for Speech, Language and Communication\\". As part of the Teaching School Alliance, St Marylebone School is working with various partners to support the development of other schools in London, including the expansion of St Mary and St John's Primary School in Hendon into a through- school from nursery through to sixth form. The former headteacher Elizabeth Phillips advised on the bid to establish a new free secondary school for boys in Marylebone, the Marylebone Boys' School, which opened in 2014. The new school will receive support and guidance from St Marylebone through the Teaching School Alliance. Headteachers From 1993 to 2013, the headteacher of St Marylebone School was Elizabeth Phillips, OBE. The new headteacher is Kathryn Pugh, who took over in January 2014.

Reasons to self-wound Most self-inflicted wounds occur during wartime, for various reasons. During WW2 at the Battle of the Bulge, many soldiers on both sides died from enemy actions, but also from the cold, harsh weather. A soldier striving to out of this “suicidal” battle where they die either way, they might say they need to urinate, or make some other excuse to go off in the woods alone—then shoot themselves in an extremity and blame it on an enemy bullet. Medics treat the injured soldier and most likely send them out of the action to relative safety. Potential draftees may self-injure to have a health deferment to conscription. This was practiced as Abstinence (conscription) by some Jewish conscripts in the Russian Empire. In prisons and forced labour camps, people sometimes self-injure to avoid forced labor and spend time in the relatively less stressful conditions of the infirmary or barracks. Types of wounds Common wound types include a gun shot to the hand, arm, leg, or foot. A person can achieve the same effect by deliberately neglecting their health, e.g., by letting a minor wound become infected, or \\"forgetting\\" foot care in damp conditions that lead to fungal infections. Punishments In most militaries, self-inflicted wounds are considered a serious military offense. Most self- inflicted wounds go unrecognized, though consequences are often severe if caught. In the British army during World War I, the maximum penalty for a self-inflicted wound (\\"Wilfully maiming himself with intent to render himself unfit for service\\" as it was described) under Section 18 of the Army Act 1881 was imprisonment, rather than capital punishment. In the British Army, 3,894 men were found guilty, and were sent to prison for lengthy periods.First World War.com - Encyclopedia - Self-inflicted Wounds (SIW)Blighty Wounds In Nazi concentration camps, self-injury was dangerous as the incapacitated were often just executed, but in some lower-stringency camps it has indeed been documented. History Many self-inflicted wound reports during World War I placed soldiers under suspicion for injuries that could have been genuine accidents. During World War II, almost all armies (in particular, the Soviet Army and the Wehrmacht) had cases of self-inflicted injury.

On November 2, 2006, Microsoft and Novell announced a joint agreement whereby Microsoft promised not to sue Novell or its customers for patent infringement.Microsoft and Novell Announce Broad Collaboration on Windows and Linux Interoperability and Support According to a statement on the blog of Mono project leader Miguel de Icaza, this agreement only extends to Mono for Novell developers and users. Because of the possible threat of Microsoft patents, the FSF recommends that people avoid creating software that depends on Mono or C#. The Microsoft–Novell agreement was criticized by some in the open source community because it violates the principles of giving equal rights to all users of a particular program (see Agreement with Microsoft and Mono and Microsoft's patents). In response to the Microsoft–Novell agreement, the Free Software Foundation revised its GNU General Public License to close the loophole used by Microsoft and Novell to bypass the GPL's very strong and protective provisions on patent deals (considered by Microsoft as restrictive).Microsoft takes on the free world. The FSF also stated that by selling coupons for Novell's Linux software, the mechanism by which Microsoft circumvented the GNU license, it considers Microsoft to be a Linux vendor, and thereby subject to the full terms and conditions laid out in the GPL. The .NET landscape started to change in 2013, when Microsoft decided to open-source many of its core .NET technologies under Apache License,Microsoft still open sources more technologies than many think with even more donated to newly formed .NET Foundation in 2014.Microsoft open sources more of its .NET technologies Open- sourced technologies include ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, Managed Extensibility Framework, Roslyn compiler-as-a-service infrastructure (together with C# and Visual Basic .NET compilers), F# functional-first language compiler,The F# Software Foundation and many more..NET Foundation Projects Microsoft and Xamarin announced collaboration, with the intent to increase cross-platform availability of .NET on Mac OS, Linux, and mobile devices.Xamarin partners with Microsoft to deliver .NET everywhere Microsoft released in June 2016 .NET Core 1.0, which is an open-source cross-platform environment and a lean version of the pure Windows implementation. Traditional computer applications =Desktop applications= Although Java's AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing libraries are not shy of features, Java has struggled to establish a foothold in the desktop market. Sun Microsystems was also slow, in the eyes of some, to promote Java to developers and end-users in a way that makes it an appealing choice for desktop software. Even technologies such as Java Web Start, which have few parallels within rival languages and platforms, have barely been promoted. The release of Java version 6.0 on December 11, 2006, saw a renewed focus on the desktop market with an extensive set of new tools for closer integration with the desktop. At the 2007 JavaOne conference Sun made further desktop related announcements, including a new language aimed at taking on Adobe Flash (JavaFX), a new lightweight way of downloading the JRE that sees the initial footprint reduced to under 2 Mb, and a renewed focus on multimedia libraries. An alternative to AWT and Swing is the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), which was originally developed by IBM and now maintained by the Eclipse Foundation. It attempts to achieve improved performance and visualization of Java desktop applications by relying on underlying native libraries where possible. On Windows, Microsoft's .NET is a popular desktop development providing both Windows Forms (a lightweight wrapper around the Win32 API), Windows Presentation Foundation, and Silverlight. With the integration of .NET into the Windows platform, .NET apps are first class citizens in the Windows environment with tighter OS integration and native look and feel compared to Java's Swing. Outside of Windows, Silverlight is portable to the Mac OS X desktop. Mono is also becoming more common in open-source and free software systems due to its inclusionMono Applications? Aplenty!, OSNews on many Linux desktop environments. =Server applications= This is probably the arena in which the two platforms are closest to being considered rivals. Java, through its Java EE (a.k.a. Java Platform Enterprise Edition) platform, and .NET through ASP.NET, compete to create web-based dynamic content and applications. Both platforms are well used and supported in this market. Of the top 1,000 websites, approximately 24% use ASP.NET and also 24% use Java, whereas of all the websites approximately 17% use ASP.NET and 3% use Java. Some of Oracle's Java-related license agreements for Java EE define aspects of the Java platform as a trade secret,Java EE SDK 5 Update 2 No JDK download page (reference to license agreement) and prohibit the end user from contributing to a third-party Java environment. Specifically, at least one current license for an Oracle Java EE development package contains the following terms: \\"You may make a single archival copy of Software, but otherwise may not copy, modify, or distribute Software.\\" — \\"Unless enforcement is prohibited by applicable law, you may not decompile, or reverse engineer Software.\\" — \\"You may not publish or provide the results of any benchmark or comparison tests run on Software to any third party without the prior written consent of Oracle.\\" — \\"Software is confidential and copyrighted.\\" However, while Oracle's software is subject to the above license terms, Oracle's Java EE API reference has been implemented under an open-source license by the WildFly (originally JBoss) and JOnAS projects. Microsoft's implementation of ASP.NET is not part of the standardized CLI and, while Microsoft's runtime environment and development tools are not subject to comparable secrecy agreements to Java EE, the official Microsoft tools are not open source or free software, and require Windows servers. However, a cross-platform free software ASP.NET implementation is part of the Mono project (minus Web Parts and Web Services Enhancements).Mono: ASP.NET Mono supports ASP.NET 4.0 including Web Forms, Microsoft AJAX, and ASP.NET MVC.Mono: ASP.NET Embedded applications =Mobile applications= Google's popular Android platform for mobile application is based on Java. Google adopted a customised virtual machine called Dalvik to optimise the execution of Java code for mobile devices. Oracle provides Java ME; a reference implementation for mobile OEM vendors. Java ME is made up of various profiles that are subsets of the Java desktop environment with additional libraries targeted at mobile and set-top-box development. Java ME has a very large base within the mobile phone and PDA markets, with only the cheapest devices now devoid of a KVM (a cut-down JVM for use on devices with limited processing power). Java software, including many games, is commonplace. While many feature phones include a JVM, they are not always heavily used by users (particularly in South Africa). Initially Java applications on most phones typically consisted of menuing systems, small games, or systems to download ringtones etc. However, more-powerful phones are increasingly being sold with simple applications pre-loaded, such as translation dictionaries, world clock displays (darkness/light, time zones, etc.), and calculators. Some of these are written in Java, although how often phone owners actually use them is probably unknown. Microsoft currently ships the .NET Compact Framework that runs on Windows CE and mobile devices, set-top boxes, and PDAs as well as the Xbox 360. Microsoft also provides the .NET Micro Framework for embedded developers with limited resources. Alternatively, Novell licenses embeddable versions of Mono to third parties to use in their devices, and Xamarin commercially distributes the MonoDroid and MonoTouch framework for Android and iPhone development, respectively. Windows Phone 7 uses Silverlight for native apps, but Windows Phone 8 has C# and XAML as the main languages. =Home entertainment technologies= Java has found a market in digital television, where it can be used to provide software that sits alongside programming, or extends the capabilities of a given set-top box. TiVo, for example, has a facility called \\"Home Media Engine\\", which allows Java TV software to be transmitted to an appropriate TiVo device to complement programming or provide extra functionality (for example, personalized stock tickers on a business news program). A variant of Java has been accepted as the official software tool for use on the next generation optical disc technology Blu-ray, via the BD-J interactive platform. This will mean that interactive content, such as menus, games, downloadables, etc. on all Blu-ray optical discs will be created under a variant of the Java platform. Rather than using Java, HD DVD (the defunct high-definition successor to DVD) used a technology jointly developed by Microsoft and Disney called HDi that was based on XML, CSS, JavaScript, and other technologies that are comparable to those used by standard web browsers. The BD-J platform API is more extensive than its iHD rival, with an alleged 8,000 methods and interfaces, as opposed to iHD's 400. And while Microsoft is pushing iHD's XML presentation layer by including it with Windows Vista, iHD is still a newcomer in a market sector where Java technologies are already commonplace.Format Wars - Blu-ray vs HD DVD However, the fact that the HD DVD format has been abandoned in favor of Blu-ray means that HDi is no longer supported on any optical disc format, making the BD-J format a clear winner. Runtime inclusion in operating systems =.NET/Mono= On Windows, Microsoft has promoted .NET as its flagship development platformMicrosoft article that refers to C# as its \\"flagship\\" language. by including the .NET runtime in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and 3, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7. Microsoft also distributes the Visual Studio Express development environment at no cost, and the Visual Studio Community development environment at no cost, with limited use for organizations.Visual Studio Community .NET Framework 3.5 runtime is not pre-installed on versions of Windows prior to Vista SP1, and must be downloaded by the user, which has been criticized because of its large size (65 MB download for .NET 3.5). While neither .NET nor Mono are installed with Mac OS X out-of-the-box, the Mono project can be downloaded and installed separately, for free, for any Mac user who wants to build or run C# and .NET software. As of 13 May 2008, Mono's System.WindowsForms 2.0 is API-complete (contains 100% of classes, methods etc. in Microsoft's System.WindowsForms 2.0); also System.WindowsForms 2.0 works natively on Mac OS X. C# and the CLI are included and used in a number of Linux- and BSD-based operating systems by way of including the free software Mono Project.Fedora embraces Mono - ZDNet UKDebian Mono PackagesWikipedia Uses Mono; Mono Integrated into Ubuntu/Debian - OSNews.com As a result of inclusion of .NET or Mono runtimes in the distributions of Windows and Linux, non-GUI applications that use the programming interfaces that are common to both .NET and Mono can be developed in C# or any other .NET language and then deployed across many operating systems and processor architectures using a runtime environment that is available as a part of the operating system's installation. Both Microsoft .NET and the Mono project have complete support for the Ecma- and ISO-standardized C# language and .NET runtime, and many of Microsoft's non-standardized .NET programming interfaces have been implemented or are under development in Mono, but each environment includes many components that have not been implemented in the other. =Java= No current version of Windows ships with Java; they stopped shipping with Windows XP SP1a. Java was pre-installed on all new Apple computers beginning with Mac OS X 10.0 and ending with 10.6, after which Java 6 became an optional Apple download. Java 7 and later releases are provided by Oracle. Java comes pre-installed with many commercial Unix flavors, including those from Hewlett Packard, IBM, and Oracle. As of June 2009, the Debian, Fedora 9, Mandriva,Mandriva Java package OpenSUSE, Slackware extra, and Ubuntu 8.04 distributions are available with OpenJDK, based completely on free and open-source code. Since June 2008, OpenJDK passed all of the compatibility tests in the Java SE 6 JCK and can claim to be a fully compatible Java 6 implementation. OpenJDK can run complex applications such as Eclipse, GlassFish, WildFly, or Netbeans. The Operating System Distributor License for Java (DLJ)Operating System Distributor License for Java (DLJ) was a Sun initiative to ease distribution issues with operating systems based on Linux or OpenSolaris. If Java is not installed on a computer by default, it may be downloaded by the user as a Web plugin. The Web plugin process has been criticized because of the size of the Java plugin. Unlike other plugins, the Java download is a full runtime environment capable of running not just applets, but full applications and dynamic WebStart apps. Because of this, the perceived download footprint is larger than some web plugins. However, compared to Java, other popular browser plugins have larger sizes: Java 6 JRE is 13 MB, but Acrobat Reader is 33 MB, QuickTime 19 MB, Windows Media Player 25 MB, the .NET Framework 3.0 runtime is 54 MB, and the .NET Framework 3.5 runtime is 197 MB (it's a united package for x86, x64, and IA-64; each part has approximately 60 MB). At the JavaOne event in May 2007, Sun announced that the deployment issues with Java would be solved in two major updates during the lifespan of Java 6 (the changes will not be held over to Java 7.) These include: *The introduction of a new consumer JRE edition, with an initial 2 Mb footprint and the ability to download the remaining 9 Mb in sections using an on-demand methodology. *The development of drop-in cross-platform JavaScript code, which can be used from a Web page to install the necessary JRE for a given applet or Rich Internet Application to run, if necessary. *An improvement in support for automatically downloading updates to the JRE. *support for pre-loading of the JRE, so applets and applications written in Java start up almost instantaneously.

He was the son of Christopher Grey Tennant, 2nd Baron Glenconner, and Pamela Winefred Paget. He was also the nephew of Edward Wyndham Tennant and Stephen Tennant, and the half-brother of the novelist Emma Tennant. Before succeeding to the peerage in 1983, he had travelled widely, especially in India and the West Indies. He was an avid socialite and a close friend of Princess Margaret, to whom his wife was a lady-in-waiting. In 1958, he purchased the island of Mustique in The Grenadines for £45,000. Early life Colin Tennant was born on 1 December 1926, the son of the second Baron Glenconner. His mother Pamela was the daughter of Sir Richard Paget, 2nd Baronet. After his parents divorced in 1935, he was educated at Eton College; but, for years, Tennant rarely saw his father. Holidays from Eton were spent with his maternal grandmother, Muriel Paget, a formidable grande dame who had diverted a train from the Crimea to Siberia in World War I to save the lives of 70 British nannies. After finishing his schooling at Eton, Tennant enlisted in the Irish Guards, serving during the tail end of World War II and attaining the rank of lieutenant. After the war he went up to New College, Oxford. At Oxford, he gained a reputation for being \\"terribly kind to plain girls with nice manners and extremely waspish to pretty ones with nasty manners\\". After graduating, he worked for the family's merchanting business, C. Tennant, Sons & Co, and at the same time, began to attract the attention of the gossip columns as Princess Margaret's escort. During the early 1950s, he was often involved in amateur dramatics; in 1953, he took part, with Princess Margaret, in a production for charity of an Edgar Wallace play, The Frog; Tennant played the title role (a serial killer) and the Princess was Assistant Stage Director. It was during this period that Tennant was spotted as a possible husband for Princess Margaret, who had been publicly hurt by the collapse of her hopes of marrying the divorced commoner Group Captain Peter Townsend during 1953. During the following year, he was forced to deny newspaper reports that he would shortly announce his engagement to the Princess. \\"I don't expect she would have had me,\\" he was quoted as saying, in later years. Princess Margaret met future husband Tony Armstrong-Jones, who was hired to take wedding pictures at Tennant's 1956 wedding to Lady Anne Coke.  Mustique  After purchasing the Caribbean island of Mustique in 1958, Tennant built a new village for its inhabitants, planted coconut palms, vegetables, and fruit, and developed the fisheries. In 1960 the British royal yacht Britannia carried Princess Margaret and her new husband, now Lord Snowdon, on a honeymoon cruise around the Caribbean. The royal couple visited Mustique to accept a wedding gift from Tennant, a plot of land on which the Princess was to build her holiday retreat, Les Jolies Eaux. The cost of running Mustique depleted Glenconner's family fortune, and he was obliged to take on business partners. Eventually, he went into exile on St. Lucia, where for many years he ran the \\"Bang Between the Pitons\\" restaurant (now sold to the adjacent Jalousie Plantation hotel). Glenconner and his involvement in Mustique has been the subject of multiple documentaries. In 1971, he was interviewed by Alan Whicker for an episode of Whicker's World set on the island. In 2000, a documentary by Joseph Bullman was made, entitled The Man Who Bought Mustique. It chronicled Glenconner's first visit to Mustique since his exile. Later life In 1963, his father, the 2nd Baron Glenconner, sold the family business to Consolidated Gold Fields, and Tennant suddenly inherited £1 million. At first father and son were retained as chairman and deputy chairman, but after his father's retirement in 1967, Tennant failed to become chairman and resigned. Over the years the Tennants became significant landowners as well as industrialists. Part of their land was in the West Indies, including a neglected 15,000 acres in Trinidad. Family and inheritance Anne Tennant, Baroness Glenconner, in 1950. On 21 April 1956, Tennant married Lady Anne Veronica Coke. Lady Anne is the daughter of Thomas Coke, 5th Earl of Leicester. Lady Anne had been one of Queen Elizabeth II's Maids of Honour at the 1953 coronation, and was also a close friend and lady-in-waiting of the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret. Lord and Lady Glenconner had five children, three sons and twin daughters: #Hon. Charles Edward Pevensey Tennant (15 February 1957 – 19 October 1996). He married Sheilagh Scott in 1993. He became a heroin addict and died of Hepatitis C. His son Cody Charles Edward Tennant (born 2 February 1994) became the 4th baron. #Hon. Henry Lovell Tennant (21 February 1960 – 1990; died of AIDS), married 1983 Teresa Cormack; their son, Euan Lovell Tennant (born 22 July 1980), is the current heir presumptive to the barony. Euan is married to Helen Tennant. #Hon. Christopher Cary Tennant (born 25 April 1968). He suffered severe brain damage in a motorcycle accident in 1987. He married Anastasia Papadakos in 1996, divorced. They have daughters Bella Tennant (b. 1997) and Demetra Tennant (b. 2000). Married secondly Johanna Lissack Hurn on 11 February 2011. #Hon. Flora May Tennant (born 8 November 1970), a god- daughter of Princess Margaret. She married 18 April 2005 Anton Ronald Noah Creasy. They have daughter Honor Rose Creasy (b. 2006). #Hon. Amy Tennant (born 8 November 1970). No issue. Colin Tennant inherited the peerage title and the Tennant baronetcy, along with the family's Scottish estate of The Glen, in 1983, on the death of his father. The couple came to divide their time between their house on St. Lucia and their home in England. Together with his daughter May and her husband Anton, Glenconner began to develop the Beau Estate property between the Pitons. As his eldest son, the Hon. Charles Edward Pevensey Tennant (1957–1996), predeceased him, Glenconner was succeeded by his grandson, Cody Charles Edward Tennant (born 2 February 1994). In December 2009, Tennant, then aged 83, learned that he was also father to London psychotherapist Joshua Bowler. Bowler's mother, the artists' model and bohemian Henrietta Moraes, had become pregnant following a weekend spent with Tennant after the New Year's Eve 1954 Chelsea Arts Club Ball. However, she never told Tennant about the pregnancy, and married the actor Norman Bowler seven months later; the couple divorced two and a half years after that. After Moraes' death in 1999, Bowler decided to investigate his parentage and wrote to Tennant after a mutual friend recalled seeing the young Tennant and Moraes leave the 1954 ball together. A paternity test revealed that Tennant was indeed Bowler's father, news that Tennant looked upon as \\"quite magical.\\" Tennant later announced his intention to recognise him in his will. In popular culture Colin Tennant is portrayed by Pip Carter in the Netflix television series The Crown. Anne is played by Nancy Carroll. Colin is portrayed by Jonathan Hansler in the television film The Queen's Sister (2005). In 2019, Lady Glenconner's memoir Lady in Waiting: My Extraordinary Life in the Shadow of the Crown, was published by Hodder & Stoughton. \\"I married all of my husband,\\" she writes. \\"Colin could be charming, angry, endearing, hilariously funny, manipulative, vulnerable, intelligent, spoilt, insightful and fun.\\" Notes External links *Cotton House Hotel on Mustique *Beau Estate *The Man Who Bought Mustique *The Mustique Company *Firefly Hotel on Mustique *St. Lucia Calling Category:2010 deaths Category:1926 births Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom Category:British socialites Colin ","title":"Colin Tennant, 3rd Baron Glenconner"},{"id":"10772787","text":"A boat carrying wood in the harbour Transportation is essential to trade, which has always been the backbone of the economy of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, beginning with Fort Kaministiquia in 1717. When the area was first settled its many waterways were used by the voyagers and Coureur des bois to trade their goods. Thunder Bay has a central location within Canada, and is located in the middle of the Trans-Canada Highway system, crossed by railways, and is the location of the largest outbound port on the St. Lawrence Seaway SystemPort of Thunder Bay official website See first bullet point. and the fifth busiest airport in Ontario by aircraft movements.Transport Canada TP 1496 – Preliminary aircraft statistics 2006  Highways  Thunder Bay Expressway Thunder Bay is located on a unique section of the Trans-Canada Highway system; unlike Western Canada and much of Eastern Canada, there is only one branch of this highway serving the area. As a result, a large volume of trans-Canada truck traffic goes through Thunder Bay. Trans-Canada Highway 11/17 originates 1 km east of Nipigon and terminates approximately 45 km west of Thunder Bay. The stretch of Highway from 11/17 in Nipigon to Arthur Street in Thunder Bay is designated as the Terry Fox Courage Highway,CBC.ca Archives see: Did You Know? tab and between Hodder Avenue and Arthur Street the highway is called the Thunder Bay Expressway. At the intersection of the Harbour Expressway in Thunder Bay, the Trans-Canada designation turns west, with the continuing highway heading south to Minnesota being designated as Highway 61. Other highways in the city are Highway 102, located between the intersection of Highway 11/17 at Red River Road in the east and the community of Kaministiquia in the west. Highway 61 begins at the intersection of the Harbour Expressway and Highway 11/17 and leads south to the United States border, becoming Minnesota State Highway 61. Highway 589 connects Highway 102 to Dog Lake, located in Gorham and Ware Townships, northeast of the city. The Harbour Expressway is a four-lane highway bisecting the city laterally in the Intercity and Balmoral Park areas. The \\"expressway\\" designation of both the Thunder Bay and Harbour expressways has been called into question, as both routes feature multiple lighted intersections, and are not true expressways. To bypass the urban sprawl in the south end of the city, a new stretch of highway, called the \\"Shabaqua Highway\\",McGuinty Government Secures Partnership To Improve Northern Highways was built between 1997 and 2007.Highway Opens, TBSource. 17 August 2007. Accessed 18 August 2007. It begins at the intersection of the Thunder Bay and Harbour Expressways in Thunder Bay and travels 13 km west to the intersection of Vibert Road and the Trans-Canada in Paipoonge.  City streets  Thunder Bay at 4:26:08 AM in 2016 during Expedition 47 of the ISS = Fort William Side = The Fort William street grid was originally laid out starting from the intersection of Frederica and Edward Streets, in present-day Westfort. Edward acted as the divider for the east and west sections of the town, with addresses on the east-west streets starting from 100. The north-south streets had address numbers that decreased further north, eventually reaching 0 at the site of Victoria Avenue, where addresses would then start over at 100. When the new settlement further down the Kaministiqua River was created at Victoria and Simpson Street, every street that crossed Edward was given east and west sections, like Arthur Street. Addresses decreased from 2830 while proceeding east of Edward Street, and the west sections started at 100. The entire grid system in Fort William is mostly uninterrupted due due to how flat the area is, with the exception of locations such as Victoriaville Mall, Albert E. Allin Park, and St. Martin Elementary School. Some streets are split into several different sections, like Miles Street, and some streets, like Waterloo Street, may not fall in place on the grid due to a geographical or man-made feature prohibiting it from doing so. The Simpson-Ogden and East End areas have their own grids. Simpson Street, which originally ran straight north-south, was designed to run more NE-SW, and east-west streets then ran NW-SE. The portion of East End south of Pacific Avenue was designed so that north-south streets ran NNW-SSE. Other areas, like Northwood and Parkdale, do not conform to the grid system. = Port Arthur Side = Since Port Arthur was originally built on land with plenty of hills and slopes, that section of the city contains multiple, smaller grid systems. The settlement started their grid along present-day Red River Road, which acts as the divider of the north-south sections. Red River does not fit within the grid due to the slopes it traverses on the way to the Thunder Bay Expressway. Port Arthur doesn't have streets split between east- west due to its location on the bay. The streets running parallel to the waterfront were given north-south designations, where addresses started from 0 at Red River. Those streets ran NE-SW, but once development reached today's Hillcrest Park, that changed. The streets west of High Street were slightly altered to run on a NNE-SSW orientation, which continued until Algonquin Avenue. The North End and Current River neighbourhoods have streets that run true north-south, and those streets shifted southeast to fit within the downtown grid. Neighbourhoods surrounding the northern portion of the Thunder Bay Expressway have no grid system implemented, but County Park and Jumbo Gardens do have it. However, this is usually reserved for arterial and collector roads. Streets in Jumbo Gardens east of Valley Street form a grid that has streets running NE-SW and NW-SE. Also, a north-south grid exists south of John Street, which extends into the Intercity area. = Intercity = The Intercity area has a small numbered grid consisting of First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, Thirteenth, and Sixteenth Avenues, although this grid is usually confined to the eastern end of the area. No streets are given quadrant designations, as they do not cross the north-south dividers of any part of town.  Public transit  Public transit has been present in the Thunder Bay area since 1892. Both Port Arthur and Fort William operated street cars until the late 1940s when they were replaced by electric trolley buses. When the cities amalgamated in 1970, both transit systems were merged into Thunder Bay Transit which has exclusively used diesel buses since 1972. Thunder Bay Transit provides 17 routes across the city's urban area with bus frequencies on most routes being between 15 and 45 minutes. = HAGI Transit = The Handicapped Action Group Incorporated operates a door-to-door transit serviceHAGI Transit Services for seniors and persons who are unable to use City Transit.

Railway  CP Engines in Thunder Bay Thunder Bay is an important railway hub, served by both the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railway. The city is intersected in many places by railway lines, most notably the CN line which runs diagonally through Thunder Bay South and Intercity, cutting off traffic along major arterials.Yahoo Maps This satellite image from 2002 captured a CN train crossing Memorial Avenue. Note the two city buses in the northbound lanes south of the crossing. Major rail yards are located southwest of the airport, south and east of downtown Fort William and immediately south of the East End neighbourhood, and between the city and the waterfront harbour in the intercity area.

Harbour  Thunder Bay Port is the westernmost port of the Canadian portion of the St. Lawrence Seaway. It is located over 3000 km from the Atlantic Ocean.About Thunder Bay Port The port is capable of handling all types of cargoes, and is served by the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railways. It has numerous berths allowing for a quick turn-around time. The main cargoes handled at the port are grain, coal, potash, and forest products. Keefer Terminal is the main cargo handling facility, which has 500,000 square metres of indoor storage area and 6.4 hectares of outdoor storage area.Keefer Intermodal Thunder Bay Terminals Ltd. provides a rail and vessel link for the movement of low sulphur bituminous and lignite coal from western Canada, and is located on McKeller Island.Thunder Bay Terminals Ltd = Grain terminals = Grain elevators. Thunder Bay is well known for its many grain elevators, dubbed \\"Castles of Commerce\\", on its waterfront. Thunder Bay is the second largest grain port in Canada, making it an important part of Canadian grain exports. Sixteen grain elevators are located on the waterfront, however only nine are currently operational. The nine grain elevators have a capacity of 1.4 million tonnes and are capable of handing wheat, durum, coarse grains, oilseeds, feed grains, peas and crops as well as various grain by- products.Grain Terminals = History = Abandoned grain elevator Thunder Bay has been a port since the days of the North West Company which maintained a schooner on Lake Superior. Significant navigation came after 1855 with the opening of the canal at Sault Ste. Marie (Soo locks) which allowed ships coming from the lower lakes to bypass the rapids of the St. Marys River. To facilitate navigation, the federal government dredged the Kaministiquia River from 1873 onwards and built a large breakwater in Thunder Bay beginning in 1884. Thunder Bay Port Authority manages Keefer Terminal built on a 320,000 square metre site on Lake Superior. Until the 1970s, coal, grain, iron ore and package freight were handled through the port in enormous quantities. Gradually, shipping by train and boat diminished as most package freight is transported by road. The railway's Intermodal freight transport has done away with the costly transshipment of individual goods between box cars and Lake freighters. Combined with loss of grain subsidies (the Crow Rate) and the free trade agreement with the United States, have terminated Thunder Bay's privileged position as a linchpin in Canadian east-west trade. As a result, the city has lost its traditional raison d'être as a break-bulk point, and the city is in economic decline.  Air travel  The city is served by the Thunder Bay International Airport, the fifth busiest airport in Ontario. In 2004, over 600,000 passengers travelled through the airport. The airport is serviced by Air Canada Jazz, Westjet, Bearskin Airlines, Wasaya Airways, Air Creebec, Skyservice, Thunder Airlines, Wiskair, Air Bravo, Porter Airlines, and NAC Air.  Taxi services  The two major taxi companies in Thunder Bay are Roach's Yellow Taxi and Diamond-Lacey's Taxi. Superior Accessible Taxi operates handicapped accessible taxi services.

They both progressed through the youth ranks to make brief appearances in the Charlton first team before the pair of them joined Exeter City on loan and then Cambridge United on free transfers in July 1986. =Cambridge United= Alan Kimble went on to play 299 games for United, scoring 24 goals, most of which came from the penalty spot. He played a pivotal part in the club's amazing success in climbing the lower leagues in the early 1990s but left following relegation from (old) Division Two in 1993 after seven years with the club. =Wimbledon= Kimble moved to Premier League side Wimbledon for a fee of £175,000 and stayed there for nine years, and was a regular first team player, making 215 league appearances. While in the Wimbledon side, Kimble was known to get to the byline and lump the ball upfield to the strikers. He failed to score a league goal for the club but did net once for them against Huddersfield Town in one of his 25 League Cup games for the club. Wimbledon finished in the top ten of the Premier League three times, and were League Cup semi finalists twice and FA Cup semi finalists once while Kimble played for them, but went down from the Premier League in 2000. He finally left at the end of the 2001-02 season, around the same time that the club's controversial move to Milton Keynes - which eventually resulted in its rebranding as Milton Keynes Dons - was announced. =Luton Town and non-League= After playing at the highest level he left Wimbledon at the end of the 2001–02 season following a brief loan spell at Peterborough United and joined ex-Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear at Luton Town. He managed only 12 games for Luton before dropping into the Conference National to play for Dagenham & Redbridge where he played a further 22 games to leave him with a total of more than 550 games in his top class career. He had a brief spell with Heybridge Swifts before he was invited by ex-Cambridge teammate Liam Daish to become assistant manager of Gravesend & Northfleet in March 2005. In the close season of 2009, due to financial difficulties at the club, Kimble was released from Ebbsfleet United. Managerial career After leaving Ebbsfleet United, Kimble became manager of Isthmian League Premier Division club Aveley in May 2010, with his twin brother Garry as his assistant. After five months in the job, he left Aveley in November due to personal reasons before being replaced by Carl Griffiths. Kimble was assistant manager at Hemel Hempstead Town, before moving on to Eastbourne Borough to take on the same role in February 2012. In 2014, he became manager of Maldon & Tiptree. He left the club at the end of the 2014–15 season.Former Colchester United and Spurs man Kevin Watson is new Maldon & Tiptree boss Essex Chronicle, 19 May 2015 References External links * Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Footballers from Dagenham Category:Charlton Athletic F.C. players Category:Exeter City F.C. players Category:Cambridge United F.C. players Category:Wimbledon F.C. players Category:Peterborough United F.C. players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. players Category:Heybridge Swifts F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Premier League players Category:National League (English football) players ","title":"Alan Kimble"},{"id":"10772842","text":"Shelton Joseph Fabre is an American prelate of the Catholic Church and serves as the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux, Louisiana.

It is a voluntary welfare organization and has official charity status in Singapore.  History  YWMA was founded by a group of young Muslim women professionals in 1952, before Singapore's self-governance. This group of aspiring young women, led by Taj Namazie, and under the patronage of Puan Noor Aishah, realized that the Muslim women did not know their rights pertaining to marriage and divorce, and a majority were unskilled and uneducated. This worrying status of the Muslim women sparked off the idea of an association where Muslim women professionals would volunteer to conduct classes for the women in their community and educate them on their rights.  Activities  = 1950s – 1960s = The YWMA started off with very little money to run their services and no place to hold their activities. Most of the activities were held in a local Malay school (Telok Kurau Girls’ School) and meetings were held at co-founder Aishah Alsagoff’s home. During this period, the YWMA fought for their rights of women in the Islamic Syariah court and had basic courses on dressmaking, cooking, language (English and Jawi) and religious studies. This led to a community where the women could earn a little income for themselves and learnt not to be entirely dependent on their husbands. This empowerment of women sparked off more Muslim women to develop their interests and contribute more to society. In the mid-1960s, the YWMA organized its first fundraising event, Malam International. The funds from this event was used to kick off many other self-development courses for women in the years to come. = 1970s = As Singapore attained independence and the government trying to industrialize the young city-state, the YWMA stepped up their services to prepare the Muslim women for the challenges of a changing society. The YWMA formulated courses that were more catered to the growing modern world, such as Basic Electricity Course, Financial Management courses. The YWMA started to conduct flag-days, with help from student volunteers, to fund their activities. With more funding, the YWMA extended its services to beyond that of just developing housewives. The Social Affairs Department of YWMA started to visit several girls' homes to tutor and mentor these young girls so that they could learn to rebuild their lives. = 1980s = The 1980s was significant as it saw the YWMA shift from small scale courses and social work to being a serious organization. The YWMA set up its first kindergarten to emphasize the importance of early education in the Muslim community. Within the kindergartens, there were courses for the parents, such as Effective Parenting and Personal Growth. Such courses were aimed at creating a strong family unit, which would nurture children who would grow up to be aspiring adults. = 1990s - present = The services provided by the YWMA in the 1980s expanded and carried on well into the 1990s, with more kindergartens and childcare centers. However, with the introduction of self-help groups, the YWMA stopped its tutoring and focused more on helping single parent families with very low income. Young mothers were taught how to cope with financial burdens and the stress of bringing up children. The YWMA provided emotional support of such young women. In addition, the rise in Malay youth delinquency and young un-wed mothers led to the YWMA opening up a professional counselling service for distressed youths and families. Professional social workers were employed and camps and other workshops were conducted to bond youths and strengthen their faith in their religion.

Goudeau is married to Theresa Goudeau and is the father of two adopted children, Joe and Emily. Goudeau divorced and remarried his wife. Their second wedding ceremony was performed in a Vegas drive-thru church. Goudeau says \\"I got married in a drive thru. My mother-in-law and my mom were in the backseat of my Suburban. We had classical music on the radio. My wife had a Subway napkin taped to her head as a veil. As crazy as all that was, we turned around to our mothers and they were still crying.\\" Goudeau also designs and sells decorative barbecue covers.http://www.bbqzoo.com/ BBQ Zoo He has a patent application related to his novelty barbecue covers filed with the US Patent office. Pre- Penn years Goudeau was born in Louisiana,St Austine Florida News Interview 03/02/2009 and grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. He took up the craft of juggling at the age of 15, after his father bought him a book for Christmas on how to juggle. He started performing for sidewalk crowds and at Renaissance Fairs with a group of friends, who later became known as Fly By Night Comedy Review.Linked in Profile page Goudeau graduated from Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus Clown College in 1979 where he was voted class clown, then toured with the circus from 1979 to 1981. In 1982 he traveled with a circus in Mexico, for only one season due to certain undisclosed problems. As a clown he also appeared on Romper Room and the Chicago version of Bozo the Clown. Goudeau then moved to Houston, Texas, and took a job as a writer/performer in a sketch comedy group. Unable to make a financial go, Goudeau found himself in Canada doing more juggling and riding a unicycle on what Goudeau describes as \\"fake ice that was sprayed with vegetable oil\\". Goudeau and his partner Frank were booked to work a cruise ship but Frank was injured in a paragliding accident, leaving Frank unable to perform. Goudeau quickly wrote a one-man show that evolved into the current act at the Lance Burton Show. From there, Goudeau began his solo career, and landed a gig at the Folies Bergere in Las Vegas, Nevada where he met both his wife Theresa Goudeau and Lance Burton. (Burton himself was also only a short variety act at the time.) From there Goudeau worked with Melinda, The First Lady Of Magic until he was fired (on Christmas Day). On July 3, 1991, Goudeau began a juggling act for the Lance Burton show at the Monte Carlo Hotel in Las Vegas. Goudeau took a short time off in 1995/1996 during summer months to become a Gag Instructor at the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus Clown College. At the Lance Burton Show, Goudeau does 12 minutes of comedy/stunt juggling. Atop yet another unicycle he tells jokes and juggles a wide variety of items both dangerous (chainsaws, fire, knives) and seemingly un-juggleable (bean bag chairs). Penn years Goudeau first encountered Penn Jillette when he was a street performer in San Francisco. Goudeau introduced himself as a working juggler to Penn after a Penn & Teller performance. Penn seemed impressed by the entirely normal street attire Goudeau wore when he wasn't performing.http://www.pennandteller.com/sincity/tvshow/goudeau.html Penn and Goudeau hooked up again when the Penn & Teller show moved out to Vegas. Both being part of Vegas's small variety arts community, they began to do lunch. Eventually Penn offered Goudeau a job doing warm-up juggling for his act as well as doing some comedy consulting for the TV show \\"Penn & Teller's Sin City Spectacular\\". Goudeau was slated to work with Penn on a Sci-Fi Channel television show called \\"Penn Jillette's Fi-Sci.\\" Sci-Fi did not pick up the show, however.http://www.pennandteller.com/03/coolstuff/penniphile/roadpennfisci.html While working with Penn as a writer for Penn & Teller's \\"Bullshit!\\" show, the two kicked around an idea for a daily talk radio show, based largely around their shared skepticism, atheism, and libertarian beliefs. On January 3, 2006, Penn Radio began broadcasting from Penn's personal studio, Vintage Nudes Studio, in his home \\"The Slammer\\". It was while cycling with Penn that Goudeau conceived an idea for novelty barbecue covers. =Michael Goudeau Mondays= It was suggested to Penn in email, on his Myspace account (now inactive), and in person after his Penn & Teller show, that Penn Radio devote the occasional Monday to Michael Goudeau. Goudeau would have been given a greater opportunity to talk about his interesting life and field calls and gmails directed at him. Penn indicated such an idea would not fly. =Secret Tour de France rider= During July 2006, Goudeau was experimenting with a Tour de France exercise program. Penn referred to Goudeau as a \\"Secret Tour de France rider\\". Goudeau cycled a leg of the tour every day on a stationary cycle. He matched the time (albeit not the speed/distance) of the fastest rider for each leg. He estimated he rode about a third of the race's actual distance and lost about one pound for every ten hours he spent on his bike. He lost 12 pounds in total. He biked roughly 4 to 6 hours each day the race was held. The final day of the race Goudeau seems to have not ridden the full leg as he claimed he won the race roughly an hour ahead of the fastest ride. Goudeau also noted he had not changed his diet. The early part of his ride caused him some problems with his stage performance. In front of a show attended by many of the casino's executive staff, he crashed a unicycle on stage when he didn't have the energy to jump onto it properly. Many people in the audience assumed this was part of the act and found it hilarious. =BBQ with Bobby Flay= Goudeau appeared on Episode 25 of Season 3 of BBQ with Bobby Flay.http://www.tv.com/bbq-with- bobby-flay/show/33351/episode.html Goudeau showed Flay how to prepare shark tacos.http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/shark-tacos-recipe/index.html  Post-Penn radio  * In April 2007, Michael Goudeau was in Paris to appear in an episode of France's Magic TV show \\"Le Plus Grand Cabaret Du Monde\\", a French variety show that features clowns, magicians, acrobats, contortionists, and jugglers from all around the world.http://www.tv5.ca/horaire- television/details-emission/119/33587_.html * Michael Goudeau appeared on The Tonight Show on May 4, 2007. He appeared as a \\"candle singer\\" for the \\"Does This Impress Ed Asner\\" segment. Goudeau played a slightly nervous movie projectionist from Las Vegas. He tried to impress Ed Asner by holding his hands over burning candles and yelping in pain to the tune of the Blue Danube Waltz. * On Monday, March 31, 2008, Penn updated viewers of his Crackle video podcast regarding Goudeau's current situation. A fire at the Monte Carlo on Jan. 26, 2008 resulted in the temporary shut down of The Lance Burton Show. However, Penn's Crackle video reports the show is back in production and Goudeau is back juggling at the show. As well, with the end of the writer strike, Goudeau is back writing for the 6th season of Bullshit!.

The band released two albums via Island Records between 1999 and 2001, before splitting up in 2004. History =Formation= Singer-songwriter Gerard Starkie and guitarist Ray Chan first met at Wigan & Leigh College and spent their early years in and out of various local bands which didn't quite match the sound that they were both hoping for; most notably Gerard in Embryonic and Ray in Easter. As a result, they eventually set about writing and recording a number of 4-track demos together, which were mixed by their friend Nick McCabe of The Verve. Bassist Dylan Keeton became the next member to join the band which would eventually go on to become Witness, as a result of an advert he had placed in the local Loot newspaper. After securing a record deal with Island, they went on to add both drummer John Langley and guitarist Julian Pransky-Poole – initially to enhance their live sound during gigs, but later as a full-time member – to the line-up. =Breakthrough= Before settling on the name Witness, the band initially played a handful of gigs in nearby Manchester under the names Siren and High Mountain Jag in mid-1997. Witness' big break came in the same year, as they ventured down to London to watch The Verve support Oasis at Earl's Court in September 1997. Ray, a long-time friend of Nick McCabe's, met someone backstage at the gig who did press for The Verve (Tim Vigon). He passed on a recently recorded demo tape – produced by former Tansads songwriter and guitarist John Kettle – and just a week later they had signed a three-album deal with Island Records. At this stage, Witness had not yet settled on a band name or played a gig under the name, and as such, their record contract simply referred to them as the \\"Wigan Band\\". The initial press attention enjoyed by the band came as a result of Ray's friendship with Nick, and so, comparisons with The Verve were rife. The NME even went on to refer to the band as Nick McCabe's Mates Band, during the period in which they were still nameless. Moreover, Witness were co-managed by The Verve's press officer, Tim Vigon, along with Rob Partridge, Chairman of Coalition PR, who, together, comprised Witness-based 'Valiant Management'. In 1998, Witness managed to secure support slots on tour with Whiskeytown, The Seahorses and Gene, before going on to self-release their debut single, \\"Quarantine\\", through Valiant Recordings on 23 November. The single was released on 7\\" limited edition vinyl, with only 1000 copies available. The following year, after performing further support slots for both Mansun and Deus, the band's first release for Island came with their second single, \\"Scars\\", released on 1 March 1999. It entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 71 and remained there for a sole week, as did their third single, \\"Audition\\", which followed in June of the same year. Their debut album, Before The Calm, was produced by Phil Vinall, recorded at Rockfield Studios, near Monmouth in Wales, and was released on 12 July to critical acclaim, including a glowing review in the NME; Yet, despite the magazine's high regard for the LP, it failed to gain a place on their annual \\"Top 50 Albums Of The Year\\" list. =Under A Sun= After the release of their debut LP, the band had hoped to put out a follow-up shortly after, but the songs they chose to submit to Island for inclusion on the album were rejected outright by the label's bosses, \\"who questioned the quality of the new songs\\". Following Universal's takeover of Island Records, Witness recorded and released a one-off song in April 2000 to be included on the soundtrack to the UK TV show, Randall and Hopkirk. The song, titled \\"Zero Zero\\", signified somewhat of a departure for the band from the understated, downbeat sound they had delivered on Before The Calm, as they chose to opt for a much more driving and energetic approach. They went on to perform a number of gigs previewing their new batch of songs throughout 2000, most notably at the famous Tower Ballroom in Blackpool, as a support act for Embrace on 4 May, whilst 16 May saw the US release of Before The Calm, with the inclusion of 2 bonus tracks. The band continued to pursue a new, Americana-tinged direction on their second album, Under A Sun, released on 23 July 2001, as their record label's new parent company proved to be more accepting of the band's new material. Just 5 days after its physical release, all of the album's tracks were made available to listen to in their entirety via their then-official website. Despite Pransky-Poole's involvement in the recording of the previous album, his addition to the band's official line-up coincided with the release of their follow-up, leading to assumptions that Witness' new sound was a direct result of his input. Like its predecessor, Under A Sun garnered a notable amount of critical attention, though not on the same, universal scale as that of their debut. The well-respected Americana UK website went on to crown the LP their 'Album Of The Year' for 2001: Elsewhere, comparisons with The Verve continued, along with likenings to the country rock stylings of both Neil Young and The Byrds. 'Under A Sun' spawned a further two singles for the band in the form of \\"You Are All My Own Invention\\", which preceded the album's release, issued on 9 July, and \\"Here's One For You\\" which followed on 5 November. Though both releases received some solid reviews, they failed to feature in the Top 75 of the UK Singles Chart. In an effort to broaden the band's meagre fanbase, Universal Records secured a slot for the latter of the two songs in the soundtrack to the 2001 feature film, American Pie 2, made by their sister company, Universal Pictures. =The beginning of the end= In December 2001, Julian was asked to leave the band, for reasons unknown, and by March 2002, in the midst of demoing what would have been their third album, it had been announced that Witness had been dropped by their record label. Despite this setback, they went on to perform a well-received headline set at the 'Americana One' festival in August 2002, and also returned to the studio to record an EP's worth of new material, slated for release in early 2003. In January 2003, a hometown gig was announced at Wigan's 'Mill At The Pier' for 5 April, set to promote the independent release of the planned EP. Yet, despite the gig being a sold-out success, the EP was never issued. Post-split The band 'split up' in February 2004, but continued as 'Gerard Starkie' with the same personnel. The following year the band split properly when Ray left, moving to Hong Kong to teach English. Throughout 2005, Gerard continued to perform solo gigs, whilst August 2006 saw the self-release of his debut solo album, Drawbridge. The album release was exclusive to his official MySpace site and was made solely available in download form. In November 2006, Gerard embarked on his first proper solo tour, to coincide with a new one-off track titled \\"The Whispering\\", released on the limited edition 10\\" vinyl compilation Tales From The Lux via Wigan-based Lupine Records. Alongside his solo appearances, Gerard has performed on stage with The Blue Aeroplanes, who have also featured John Langley on drums. In August 2008, it was announced that Gerard and Ray would reunite to play a one-off gig of Witness material in Hong Kong. Throughout 2010, Gerard undertook a string of fully backed solo performances to promote his forthcoming solo album, featuring Joe Allen, John Langley and Loki Lillistone of The Blue Aeroplanes.

Whilst in Insein prison in July 1941, CPB leaders Thakin Than Tun and Thakin Soe had co-authored the Insein Manifesto, which, against the prevailing opinion in the Burmese nationalist movement led by the Dobama Asiayone, identified world fascism as the main enemy in the coming war and called for temporary cooperation with the British in a broad allied coalition that included the Soviet Union. Soe had already gone underground to organise resistance against the Japanese occupation, and Than Tun as Minister of Land and Agriculture was able to pass on Japanese intelligence to Soe, while other Communist leaders Thakin Thein Pe and Thakin Tin Shwe made contact with the exiled colonial government in Simla, India. Aung San was War Minister in the puppet administration set up on 1 August 1943 which also included the Socialist leaders Thakin Nu and Thakin Mya.

The density, molar mass and the critical temperature of the liquid have to be known. At the critical point the surface tension is zero. The first assumption of the Eötvös rule is: 1\\\\. The surface tension is a linear function of the temperature. :This assumption is approximately fulfilled for most known liquids. When plotting the surface tension versus the temperature a fairly straight line can be seen which has a surface tension of zero at the critical temperature. The Eötvös rule also gives a relation of the surface tension behaviour of different liquids in respect to each other: 2\\\\. The temperature dependence of the surface tension can be plotted for all liquids in a way that the data collapses to a single master curve. To do so either the molar mass, the density, or the molar volume of the corresponding liquid has to be known.  The Eötvös rule  If V is the molar volume and Tc the critical temperature of a liquid the surface tension γ is given by :\\\\gamma V^{2/3} = k(T_c - T)\\\\, where k is a constant valid for all liquids. The Eötvös constant has a value of 2.1×10−7 J/(K·mol2/3). More precise values can be gained when considering that the line normally passes the temperature axis 6 K before the critical point: :\\\\gamma V^{2/3} = k(T_c - 6 \\\\ \\\\mathrm{K} - T)\\\\, The molar volume V is given by the molar mass M and the density ρ :V = M / \\\\rho\\\\, The term \\\\gamma V^{2/3} is also referred to as the \\"molar surface tension\\" γmol : :\\\\gamma_{mol} = \\\\gamma V^{2/3}\\\\, A useful representation that prevents the use of the unit mol−2/3 is given by the Avogadro constant NA : :\\\\gamma = k' \\\\left( \\\\frac{M}{\\\\rho N_A} \\\\right)^{-2/3}(T_c - 6 \\\\ \\\\mathrm{K} - T) = k' \\\\left( \\\\frac{N_A}{V} \\\\right)^{2/3}(T_c - 6 \\\\ \\\\mathrm{K} - T) As John Lennard- Jones and Corner showed in 1940 by means of the statistical mechanics the constant k′ is nearly equal to the Boltzmann constant. = Water = For water, the following equation is valid between 0 and 100 °C. :\\\\gamma = 0.07275 \\\\ \\\\mathrm{ N/m} \\\\cdot (1-0.002 \\\\cdot (T - 291 \\\\ \\\\mathrm{K}))  Historical  As a student, Eötvös started to research surface tension and developed a new method for its determination.

It was based in Baghdad, Iraq, before moving to Bombay, India, and then spreading to China, England, and other countries. It is said that the family descended from one of the court families of the Iberian Peninsula in the twelfth century.. They later served as Financial Advisors to Islamic Rulers. From the 18th century, the Sassoons were one of the wealthiest families in the world, with a corporate empire spanning the entire continent of Asia.Siegfried Sassoon: A biography, Max Egremont, (London 2005) Etymology Elias David, Albert (Abdallah) & Sassoon David The Sassoon Docks, Mumbai, India The name of the family strongly implies a local, Mesopotamian origin for the family. The family name of Sassoon is also commonly shared by many Armenian and Kurdish families and tribes who all originate from the mountainous district of Sason (whence the family and tribal names), west of Lake Van, in upper Mesopotamia in modern Turkey. It is, however, possible that some Spanish Sephardi blood was mixed with the primarily Mesopotamian Jewish Sasoons. Origins It is said the family descended from Joseph ben Solomon Ibn Shoshan, one of court official of the Iberian Peninsula in the twelfth century. Sassoon ben Salih (1750–1830) and his family were the chief treasurers to the pashas of Baghdad and Southern Iraq. His sons David (1792–1864), and Joseph (1795–1872) fled from a new and unfriendly wāli, in 1828 David first went to the Persian Gulf port of Bushehr and in 1832 to Bombay, India, with his large family. In Bombay, he built the international business called David S. Sassoon, with the policy of staffing it with people brought from Baghdad. They filled the functions of the various branches of his business in India, Burma, Malaya, and east Asia. He cemented the family's dominant position in the Sino-Indian opium trade. The family's businesses in China, and Hong Kong especially, were built to capitalise on the opium business. His business extended to China – where Sassoon House (now the north wing of the Peace Hotel) on the Bund in Shanghai became a noted landmark – and then to England. In each branch, he maintained a rabbi. His wealth and munificence were proverbial; his philanthropy across Asia included the building of schools, orphanages, hospitals, and museums with the proceeds of the drug trade. On his death, tributes to him were made from across the continent by Muslims, Christians, Parsees, Jews, and Hindus. Joseph Sassoon sons Joseph Sassoon went to Aleppo, Syria, where he established a merchant house and later his business interests spread to Alexandria, Thessaloniki, and Athens, which included a shipping company and a money exchange house. His five sons branched out in many directions: his son Moses Sassoon (1828–1909) returned to Baghdad before moving to Egypt where he built the financial house Joseph Sassoon & Sons, which later expanded and became an agent for Crédit Foncier in Egypt. In 1871 Moses' son Jacob Sassoon (1850–1936) was one of the largest cotton plantation owners in Egypt, and owned cotton mills; during the American civil war his older brother Nissim (1840–1917) had made a fortune exporting Egyptian cotton to England making him Egypt's largest cotton exporter. In 1927, with Misr Bank and other Egyptian businessmen, Jacob Sassoon founded of Misr Spinning and Weaving Company (Arabic: شركة مصر للغزل والنسيج), also known as Misr Helwan or the El-Ghazl factory owning 61% of the company's shares. Jacob Sassoon also founded Egypt Crédit Foncier with the Joseph Vita Mosseri, his grandson Eliau Joseph Sassoon was an architect, and designed the Asicurazione de Trieste Building. Eliau Sassoon was also a real estate investor and developer, who foresaw the unparalleled growth of Cairo and the lucrative effect such expansion would have on land values. It is not surprising, therefore, that many of the properties he invested in were located at the nexus of the elegant European quarter of Ismailia or in the choicest parts of Kasr al-Dubara, and later, in Garden City, Zamalek, and Giza. In 1952 his grandson Eliau (Elias) Nissim Eliau Joseph Sassoon (1928–2010) founded Banque Du Caire with Maurice Joseph Cattaui (1925–2009). Eliau (Elias) Nissim Joseph Sassoon Eliau (Elias) Nissim Eliau Joseph Sassoon (Hebrew: אליהו נסים אליאו יוסף ששון) (1928-2010), (always called Elias), born in Aleppo, Syria, to Nassim Eliau Sassoon (1911–1988) a wealthy merchant, banker, and former partner at Safra Freres a bank based in Aleppo, and Messouda Sassoon (born Shamash) (1911–1992). Elias Sassoon was Joseph Sassoon's most influential and wealthiest descendant, in 1940 he was sent to Alexandria to attend the prestigious boarding school, Victoria College. He later joined his family's business in 1946 where he worked for the family's business in Egypt. Among the many holdings, the family had at the time included interests in the Burmah Oil Company, Turkish Petroleum Company and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a textile factory, a large cotton export business and interests in both the General Company of Commerce and Industry of Greece (later Attica Enterprises Holding S.A.) and Atlas Maritime. In 1947 Elias focused his attention on three primary sectors: the new booming oil exploration industry sweeping the Middle East, shipping and banking. With a £5000 loan from his father, Elias invested in Standard Oil adding to his family's existing holdings in the company. That same year he married Hannah Rochel Jacque Sassoon (née de Menasche) (1929–2009), granddaughter of Baron Jacques Bohor Yacoub Levi de Menashe (d.1916). His great-grandfather, David Solomon Sassoon (1871–1956) had been an investor in Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, which later partnered with Standard Oil to provide markets for the oil reserves in the Middle East. In 1906, SOCONY (later Mobil) opened its first fuel terminals in Alexandria with financing provided by David Solomon Sassoon. Elias Sassoon was a devoted Zionist and considered the British anything but friends to the Jewish people because of their blockade in the Mediterranean to refugee vessels carrying Jewish refugees fleeing the horrors of World War II, and although to a lesser extent, he considered the British government as culpable nonetheless in the atrocities against world Jewry. In 1952 he cofounded Banque Du Caire with his childhood friend Moise Joseph Maurice Cattaui (1925–2009). By then Elias Sassoon had expanded his family's business to France, Brazil, South Africa and the United States where the family exported cotton to and had maintained trading posts since the 1800s. The Sassoons believed that Mesopotamia (now Syria and Iraq) contained substantial reservoirs of oil, the forerunner of the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC). David Solomon Sassoon was among the first to secure the interest of the Imperial German banks and companies, already involved in the building of the Berlin–Baghdad railway, which he played an active role in its financing. This German interest was followed by British interests when David Sassoon became an agent for the Rothschilds in Ottoman Empire. In 1911, in an attempt to bring together British and German interests competing in the region, Sassoon formed a consortium of British investors composed of banks and companies and formed the African and Eastern Concession Ltd. In 1953 Elias Sassoon used these networks of interests to expand his family's investment interests to include mining concessions in Africa. In 1957 the new Egyptian post-revolution government under Nasser nationalized all European particularly British and French companies and banks. The government also began expelling foreigners and the Jewish community of Egypt once again, despite its many contributions to the country's artistic, economic, political, and academic fields found itself under the government's harassment and intimidation, many were forced to leave the country with no more than one suitcase and most had their assets and properties seized by the Revolutionary Council. The Sassoons were among those, whose assets were confiscated and in 1966 Elias Sassoon and his wife were taken to the port in Alexandria and expelled from the country. Elias’ wife who was an Egyptian citizen was declared non-citizen, and at the request of the Egyptian government, Elias's Syrian citizenship was revoked. They were given laissez-passer (travel documents) and ordered aboard a ship bound for Greece, however, their son Edouard Elias Sassoon (1948–1985) who was a medical student at the University of Alexandria was denied exit visa. The government accused Elias Sassoon of using his family's banking network to help smuggle assets belonging to members of the Jewish community out of the country and demanded that he return his assets held in Europe before his son is allowed to leave. After paying what amounted to ransom money, totaling £4 million and the intervention of both the French and the Greek governments, Edouard Sassoon joined his family in 1971, with his wife Josephine Celine Esther (née Cattaui) (1949–1994), daughter of Moise Cattaui who was also denied exit visa after her family was expelled from the country in 1964. Elias Sassoon had established Sassoon Cattaui Investment Holding (later, Providence Group), a privately owned family hedge fund with Moise Cattaui in 1961 in Switzerland with assets from the Sassoon Family Trust, which had been formed in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1910. In 1970, the partners moved the company Curaçao (Netherlands Antilles) a private family investment group, which is not required to register with the SEC or comply with reporting requirements under the Dodd–Frank, reform act. It is said that at the time of formation of the Fund, the total value of assets under management in 1961 was £25million. The Fund invested in commercial real estate properties in the U.S., Canada, and Greece as well as in precious metals, oil & gas, and securities. The Fund also speculated in the currency markets, among its many holdings are: BHP Billiton, the co-investor in Le Méridien Hotel company with Air France, American Express, GM, Wells Fargo Bank, HSBC, Lehman Brothers, Exxon Mobile, Conoco Phillips, Fendi, Giorgio Armani, Microsoft, Sun Microsystem, Midland Bank, stockbroking firm Frankel Pollak (which was later sold to Sasfin Bank, a Sassoon family bank based in South Africa) and S&P.; It is rumored that at the time of Elias Sassoon's death, the Fund, which is not required to file its financials with the SEC had over $100 billion of assets under management, most of which are assets of both the Sassoon and Cattaui families. David S. Sassoon sons Sir Philip Sassoon, John Singer Sargent, 1923 Sassoon's eight sons also branched out in many directions. The Sassoon family was heavily involved in the shipping and opium production industry in China and India. Elias David (1820–1880), his son by his first wife, had been the first of the sons to go to China, in 1844. He later returned to Bombay, before leaving the firm to establish E.D. Sassoon & Co. in 1867, with offices in Bombay and Shanghai. Another son, Albert Abdullah David Sassoon (1818–1896) took on the running of the firm on his father's death, and notably constructed the Sassoon Docks, the first wet dock built in western India. With two of his brothers he later became prominent in England, and the family were friends of the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII. One daughter of the family, Rachel Sassoon Beer, joined her husband in running a number of British newspapers, including The Sunday Times (1893–1904) and The Observer, which she also edited. Portrait of Siegfried Sassoon by Glyn Warren Philpot, 1917. Fitzwilliam Museum Of those who settled in England, Sir Edward Albert Sassoon (1856–1912), the son of Albert, married Aline Caroline de Rothschild, and was a Conservative member of Parliament from 1899 until his death. The seat was then inherited by his son Sir Philip Sassoon (1888–1939) from 1912 until his death. Philip served in the First World War as military secretary to Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and, during the 1920s and 1930s, as Britain's undersecretary of state for air. The twentieth-century English poet, one of the best known World War I poets, Siegfried Sassoon (1886–1967) was David's great-grandson. Another descendant of David Sassoon is the British banker and former Treasury's commercial secretary James Meyer Sassoon. He was mentioned in the Paradise Papers as one of the beneficiaries of a tax exempt Cayman Island trust fund worth $236 million in 2007 and defended it as being of non UK origin. The branch which carried on the rabbinical tradition has been represented by Rabbi Solomon David Sassoon (1915–1985), who moved from Letchworth to London and then to Jerusalem in 1970. He was the son of one David Solomon Sassoon (1880–1942) who collected Jewish books and manuscripts and catalogued them in two volumes. The bulk of this collection is stored at the British Library in London, England. Some examples of this collection are maintained at the University of Toronto Library in Toronto, Canada. None of these priceless works are presently stored in the United States. David Sassoon was the son of Flora Abraham, who had moved from India to England in 1901 and established a famous salon in her London home. Solomon Sassoon had two sons, Isaac S. D. Sassoon and David Solomon Sassoon, who are both rabbis.

Nydam Mose also known as \\"Nydam Bog\\", is an archaeological site located at Øster Sottrup, a town located in Sundeved, eight kilometres from Sønderborg, Denmark. History In the Iron Age, the site of the bog was a sacred place, where the weapons and ships of vanquished armies were offered to the indigenous gods in thanks for victory over the fallen enemy. Many items were deliberately destroyed (bent, broken or hacked into pieces) in ritual sacrificial acts, from the period 200–400 CE. Nydam Bog has played a role in the Danish national claim for Southern Jutland. The first known finds from the bog date from the 1830s, when a local farmer gave old swords and shields as toys to his children. Amongst numerous other items, three boats were found in Nydam Bog. In particular, the 23-metre-long oak boat, commonly known as \\"the Nydam Boat\\", maintains a distinguished position amongst Danish Iron Age finds, as it is the oldest known rowing vessel in Northern Europe. The oak (egetræsbåden) boat is on display at the archaeological museum in Gottorp Castle, Schleswig, Germany. Excavation Objects discovered in Nydam Bog on display at Gottorf Castle. =First excavation= From 1859 to 1863, archaeologist Conrad Engelhardt excavated the bog. Engelhardt found weapons, tools, pieces of clothing and two intact clinker built boats, one made of oak and one made of pine. The weapons include lances, spears, bows, arrows and round shields. Under these finds were the remains of a third boat, which apparently had been demolished already during the sacrifice. Engelhardt's work ceased with the outbreak of the Second Schleswig War in early 1864. Some of the discoveries from the bog were lost during the Second Schleswig War. The smaller of the two boats, perhaps 19 meters long and made of pine, was hacked up and used as firewood by troops. =Second excavation= The National Museum of Denmark resumed excavation of the bog in 1989. During excavation a large quantity of weapons have come to light, in the form of swords, spears, bows and arrows; and also personal effects such as belt buckles, brooches and ornate clasps. These finds originate from the Iron Age, in the period between 250–550 CE. Nydam boat The Nydam oak boat on display at Gottorf Castle, Schleswig, Germany. The Nydam Mose sacrifice site was probably used on different occasions during the years 200–450 CE. Conrad Engelhardt on August 17, 1863 discovered the Nydam Boat. The oak boat was the first boat found, and the only one still preserved. It has been dendro dated to 310–320 CE. The oak boat is considered the oldest Nordic shipfind and the oldest known clinker built boat. It is 23 m long, c 4 m wide, of clinker type, and built for 15 pairs of oars. The Nydam boat is the largest and best preserved of the boats found in Nydam Bog and is now displayed at Gottorf Castle in Schleswig, Germany. It once weighed over three tonnes and was rowed by thirty men. Nydam Society Interest in the archaeology of Nydam Bog has always been particularly lively in the local area. The Nydam discoveries were and remain a significant theme in the relationship between Danish and German cultures in the border region. On this basis, the \\"Society for Nydam Research\\" – commonly known as the Nydam Society - was formed in 1983. Through its work, this interest group has contributed to the resumption of National Museum of Denmark's investigation of the bog. Today, the site is a green meadow. Parking is available on Nydamvej. From here, there is a path (Nydamstien) to the small white house, Nydamhuset, which is situated beside the site of the archaeological discoveries. It takes about 10 minutes to walk there. The Nydam Society's long-standing desire to build a replica of the Nydam Boat has been realized. The Nydam Tveir was built employing the techniques of the time – both to exploit the material characteristics of the timber and to develop an understanding of how large vessels were built in that period. Construction of a replica of the Nydam Boat was based on the oak boat found in 1859. The construction of the Nydam Boat was divided into two phases. Phase 1 was a feasibility study to investigate the construction of the boat. Here the builders investigated prerequisites and gathered experience for use in Phase 2, which comprised building the complete boat.

During an October 22 game in Cleveland, Ames and fellow player Pudge Heffelfinger were observed by the manager of the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. A week later the Pittsburgh Press printed a rumor that the Pittsburgh Athletic Club was offering Heffelfinger and Ames $250 to play for the team on Saturday, November 12, against their rivals, the Allegheny Athletic Association. Meanwhile, another version of the story had Ames being offered only $100. However, the rumor either turned out to be false or Heffelfinger and Ames turned down Pittsburgh's offer. During an 1892 Chicago game against the New York Cresants, the Cresants refused to take field unless Chicago's Sport Donnelly was barred from the Chicago lineup because of some alleged rough tactics he used while playing for the Manhattan Athletic Club, in 1891. Chicago benched Donnelly, and his absence resulted in a tied game. Donnelly then became enraged and refused to rejoin the team in Chicago. Heffelfinger and Ames joined Donnelly in the walkout. Afterward Donnelly and Heffelfinger signed an agreement with the Allegheny Athletic Association, becoming the first known professional football players. Meanwhile, Ames had decided to forgo the game rather than risk his amateur status.

It consists of 7,100 officers and is located in Munich, Germany. The headquarters was established on October 1, 1975, being reorganized from the city police (Stadtpolizei München).  Overview  Its jurisdiction spans over all of Munich (except exterritorial grounds), its districts and a small portion of Starnberg (Krailling and Stockdorf, the latter being a part of Gauting). Hubertus Andrä has been the Police Commissioner since July 2013. The Police headquarters has seven subordinate operational bureaus. Three Regional Bureaus (Central, East, West) with a total of 25 police stations, that perform uniformed patrol duty and respond emergency calls. The Traffic Police Bureau is responsible for special traffic functions as speed checks and fatal accidents. Special Services such as the Spezialeinsatzkommando (police tactical unit) is covered by the Special Forces Bureau. Rapid Reaction Companies (Einsatzhundertschaften), Bomb Squad (also responsible for confiscated firearms), the Dog Squad (Hundestaffel) and Mounted police (Reiterstaffel) by the Central Services Bureau. The Investigation Bureau has 10 units (Kriminalfachdezernate), which are organised in offence oriented sections and squads. They prevent, pursue and clear up serious criminal offences. Scandals A number of incidents in the late 1990s ranging from police brutality at the Oktoberfest to the fatal shooting of a bystander and drug trading within the police caused debate in parliament. The minister of the interior announced reform. In January 2013 a photograph of a 23-year-old woman badly beaten by police officers while tied made the press. Police president Wilhelm Schmidbauer sanctioned the actions of the officers, blamed the victim, and had her home raided. The state attorney took weeks to start investigating the officers but did not hesitate to prosecute the victim. Vehicles The standard patrol car of Munich Police is the BMW 3 Series. Also in use are the BMW 5 Series, Audi A4 and Volkswagen Touran. Rapid Reaction Companies and the Dog Squad use Volkswagen Transporter T4/T5.

He was the Bishop of TruroTruro Cathedral website from 1990 to 1997. He is the identical twin brother of the former Bishop of Gloucester, Peter Ball, a convicted sex offender. Early life Ball was born on 14 February 1932. Ball was educated at Lancing College and Queens' College, Cambridge. Career Ball's first teaching post in 1955 was in general science at Pocklington School, East Yorkshire, where he was also house tutor at Lyndhurst, the junior boarding house. He left in 1960 to found the community mentioned below, which in fact was first situated in Kelham, near Newark, Nottinghamshire. He was a teacher of biology and chemistry at Marling School in Stroud, GloucestershireMuseum in the Park, Stroud and was then head of the lower school until 1975. He was chaplain of Sussex University 1976 to 1980, suffragan Bishop of Jarrow from 1980 to 1990 and then the 13th Bishop of Truro. He was the first bishop there to ordain women. In 1960, Ball founded a monastic community at Stratford Park in Stroud, along with his identical twin brother Peter Ball. Peter Ball later became suffragan Bishop of Lewes (1977–1992) and then Bishop of Gloucester (1992–1993). Peter Ball was later convicted and imprisoned for sex offences. Ball is the author of Foolish Risks of God, a Lenten study course on the parables of the New Testament (Mowbray Lent Book, ) published in 2002. In the book's introduction he writes of the parables, > The deepest problems of the universe are hidden in their simplicity, whether > it be free will and choice, reward and punishment, or justice and mercy, > power and powerlessness, and in most cases Jesus has complete confidence in > our ability to understand their significance for ourselves, despite what the > Gospel writers and preachers ever since have tried to do with them. They are > not commandments for behaviour, though they may gently persuade; neither are > they black and white morsels of theology. They are signposts to God and > guides to living and loving. Ball was one of four bishops who failed to respond to reports of sexual abuse by a prominent member of Truro diocese, according to a 2018 case review commissioned by the diocese. The diocese had failed to investigate the accusations against Jeremy Dowling, a lay preacher and synod member, who rose to influential positions including diocesan communications officer. Dowling was jailed in 2015 for seven years, and again in 2016 for a further eight years, for a series of indecent assaults on boys while teaching at a Cornwall school during the 1960s and '70s. The review found that \\"There is no doubt that there were a number of missed opportunities for the diocese of Truro to undertake its own investigations into the allegations made in 1972 against Jeremy Dowling.\\" Kim Stevenson, a criminal justice expert said that the report made \\"sadly familiar reading\\" and she contrasted the situation in Britain with that in Australia where those who concealed or did not act on evidence of a sexual offence faced prosecution. Personal life In retirement, Ball and his twin brother Peter, a former Bishop of Lewes and of Gloucester, lived together in rural Somerset until Peter Ball was convicted of sex offences.

The board evaluates the suitability of the candidate for becoming an officer using a standardized protocol of evaluation system which constitutes of personality, intelligence tests, and interviews. The tests are of both types i.e. written and practical task-based. An SSB comprises the panel of assessors, who are officers in Indian Armed Forces and having their specialization as Psychologist, GTO (Group Task Officer) and Interviewing Officer. In total there are thirteen Service Selection Boards across India, out of which four boards are for Indian Army, four boards are for Indian Air Force and five boards for Indian Navy. SSB is a 5–6 days evaluation process. Introduction There are a variety of pathways to a commission as an officer in Indian Armed Forces. This applies to both for civilians (after 10+2, graduation and post graduation), as well as for serving armed forces personnel. All except army medical corps members must succeed in the \\"SSB interview\\". There is no limit to the number of attempts that can be made. The interview involves a battery of psychological tests of personality, to assess the candidate's suitability for commission to the armed forces. The tests help the SSB select candidates with officer like qualities (\\"OLQs\\"). The Services Selection Board is not concerned with the number of commissions available. Its responsibility is just to assess and then, recommend. Successful candidates have a medical examination and if satisfactory are recorded on a \\"merit list\\" before training and commission. The selection occurs over a five-day process. Day 1 - screening test, Day 2 - psychological tests, Days 3 and 4 - group test, and Day 5 - compilation of results in conference. A personal interview is also included during the selection period. The qualities looked for in the selection period include intellect, responsibility, initiative, judgement under stress, ability to reason and organize, communication skills, determination, courage, self-confidence, speed in decision making, willingness to set an example, compassion and a feeling of loyalty to the nation. The candidates are billeted during the selection period and complete the assessment in a group with other candidates. Observations of the group are constant. Procedure The candidates who have passed the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) written examination, or who, in the case of the Territorial Army have been recommended by a Preliminary Interview Board (PIB), or, who have been asked to present to the Service Selection Board are allocated a SSB centre to attend. Service candidates attend via movement orders made by their superiors. Various entries like Technical entry and NCC special entry gets direct call letter to attend SSB. The selection is based on the concept of Manasa, Vacha and Karmana. The personality of the candidate is observed by the officers using various tests for the candidates like psychology test, interview and GTO tasks. There is no right or wrong answers in SSB as every individual acts in different way to the same situation. The aim is to check whether the candidate is right fit to become an officer in the defense force. =Day 0= On the day candidate has to report, he has to follow the instructions as mentioned in the SSB call letter. Generally, the candidate has to report at the railway station in the morning between 7 Am – 8 Am, and from there candidates are escorted to the board by one of the SSB official. On the very same day, candidates are made to sit in the testing hall where they have to present their educational documents for verification and are allotted a number (called as Chest Number) by which they will be able to identify the candidates throughout the process. A briefing about the schedule, various tests and general instructions is given. =Day 1, Screening test – Stage I= On Day 1, stage one of testing is administered. This includes a verbal and non-verbal intelligence test (About 50 questions each) and then a Picture Perception and Description Test (PPDT). In this test, a picture, either hazy or clear is shown to the candidates for 30 seconds. Each candidate observes it and then, in the next one minute, must record the number of characters seen in the picture. Then within a given time, each candidate must write nearly seventy words, make a story from the picture (not just describe the picture). The candidate must record the mood, approximate age and gender of the first character they saw, known as the \\"main character\\". In stage two of the PPDT, the candidates are given their stories which they may revise. Each candidate in the group must narrate his or her story within one minute. The group is then asked to create a common story involving each of them or their perceived picture stories. After the completion of these tests, unsuccessful candidates are dismissed. Other candidates are short-listed. They must complete the first of the five personal information questionnaires which must be recorded in the same manner. The personal information questionnaire is the main basis for the individual candidate interview. =Day 2, Psychology test – Stage II= On Day 2, a thematic apperception test (TAT) or picture story writing is administered. It is similar to the PPDT, but the picture used is clear. Again the candidates are shown a picture for thirty seconds and then write a story in the next four minutes. Twelve such pictures are shown sequentially. The last picture is a blank slide inviting the candidates to write a story of their choice. Candidates do not need to remember the number of characters in each picture and there is no group discussion. The next test will be Word Association Test (WAT). The candidates are shown sixty simple everyday words in sequence. Each is shown for fifteen seconds. For each word, the candidates write the first thought that come to mind in response to the word. Other tests administered on day two are the Situation Reaction Test (SRT) in which a booklet of 60 situations is given in which the responses are to be completed in 30 minutes and finally the Self Description Test (SDT) which consists of 5 questions asking about the candidate's parent's, teacher's, friend's and his or her own perception. =Days 3 and 4, Group test is conducted by a GTO (Group Testing Officer) – Stage III= On the third and fourth days, there are tasks including group discussion; group (military) planning exercises; progressive group tasks; small (half) group tasks; individual tasks (obstacles); group obstacle or \\"snake race\\"; command tasks; a lectorate and a final group task. Along with GTO, individual candidate interview is conducted by the interviewing officer. It is based on the personal information questionnaires filled by the candidates on day 1 and other general knowledge. =Day 5, final assessment and results (Conference)= On day five, All the officers in proper uniform will attend a conference with each candidate. They will also have a conversation with a panel of assessors. The assessors will look for confidence and expression when speaking; a positive attitude in adversity and in life; and honesty. Following this, the final results are announced. Successful candidates will remain for an intensive medical examination which takes four to five days at a military hospital. Pilot Aptitude Battery Test (PABT – Once in a lifetime Test) The Pilot Aptitude Battery Test (PABT) is administered to candidates hoping to join the Flying Branches only of the Indian Air Force, Indian Navy, Indian Army or Indian Coast Guard. The PABT is conducted during the SSB interview. Candidates may sit the PABT only once. The PABT includes the Instrument Battery Test, a Sensory Motor Apparatus Test (SMA) and a Control Velocity Test (CVT). More recently, the \\"Computerized Pilot Selection System\\" (CPSS) has been used. It was created by former president of India Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam with the Defence Institute of Psychological Research and the Air Defence Establishment, groups within the Defence Research and Development Organisation. It was developed to determine aptitude for use of intellect with respect to advanced aircraft. CPSS machine simulates an aircraft cockpit. Video games played by the candidate on a screen in front of him is scored best of three games. It tests hand, leg, vision and hearing coordination. Instrument Battery Test The Instrument Battery Test (INSB) is a paper, pencil and machine based test. It has two parts. The candidate must listen to a briefing and then interpret the dials of an instrument panel of an aircraft. If the candidate does well, they proceed to the machine part of the test. The machine test includes the Sensory Motor Apparatus Test (SMA) and the Control Velocity Test (CVT) which examine a candidate's co-ordination. The tests are administered in one day and candidates may only ever attempt the tests once. Indian Coast Guard Selection Board The Indian Coast Guard (ICG) is part of the Ministry of Defence. ICG officer selection is similar to SSB and is conducted in two phases. Phase 1 is called the Preliminary Selection Board Exam (PBS) which is similar to the SSB screening stage. Phase 2, the Final Selection Board, includes psychological tests, group tasks, a personal interview and an assessor' conference. shortlisted candidates proceed to later testing.

The statement was the subject of a national process of public consultation coordinated by the Human Rights Commission, and was endorsed by the National Interfaith Forum in Hamilton in February 2007 as a basis for ongoing public discussion.  Government ratification  Prime Minister Helen Clark presented the statement to the third Asia-Pacific Dialogue on Interfaith Cooperation to be held at Waitangi from May 29–31, 2007.  Controversy  Brian Tamaki, a Bishop of the Destiny Church stated: \\"That [Christianity] is the chosen religion of the Head of the Commonwealth. For us to depart from that, don't you think that that is bordering on creating some type of treason, religious treason anyhow?\\". A poll of 501 New Zealanders by Research New Zealand in June 2007 found that 58% of respondents did not think Christianity should be New Zealand's official religion. Another source of controversy has been the fact that the composition of the working group managing the formulation of the National Statement and its endorsement was limited to representatives of religious groups. Consequently, while extending some rights to non-religious people the Statement did omit to extend the right of safety (clause 3). This has led to some, such as the New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists, to criticise the National Statement.

This ridge also overlooks the two other parts of Eastcotts – Harrowden to the north and Cotton End to the south. The name is taken from Short Brothers. The Admiralty established an airship works for the company in 1916. The company pulled out of airship work just three years later, but the name Shortstown stuck. Transport Road access to the village is provided by the A600 road. The Stagecoach bus also runs frequent routes in the village, with Route 9 running to and from the town centre at frequent intervals. Routes 9A and 9B also provide connections to Bedford as well as the nearby locations of Cotton End and Shefford, continuing on to Hitchin.  Village history  A map from 1915 of an area where Shortstown now stands. Shortstown was built on Tinker's Hill, Harrowden. Before it was built, a windmill stood on the site from 13th to 16th century. From 17th to 18th century, the area was known as Windmill Hill. Shortstown started with the establishment of the Airship Works in 1917 when housing for the workforce was built next to the airfield. In 1918 and 1927, sheds (later Grade II* listed buildings) were built for the R100 and R101 airships which then represented the latest passenger flight technology. The village was originally built by the Short Brothers for its workers, but evolved into a settlement for people working at the RAF Cardington base. Shortstown was only created from 1916 onwards. The land originally lay in the township of Eastcotts which was itself a part of the ancient parish of Cardington. Eastcotts became a separate civil parish in 1866. A map from 1946 of an area where Shortstown now stands. Early in 1916 the Admiralty was seeking a site for an airship works for Messrs. Short Brothers and after a two-month search the Naval Director of Air Services reported in March 1916 that a site had been selected at Cardington. It was picked as it was well served by roads and railways, was within easy reach of London by steam train and was a broad, flat valley running east-west without any obstructions. It was beyond the range of then known German bombers in Belgium, while \\"penetration by submarine landed agents was not considered likely due to the distance from the coast which it would be necessary to travel\\". There was also suitable surplus labour available in Bedford, and \\"the river affords a means of disposing of the effluent from sewage disposal works if such are established\\". The whole site was bought by the Admiralty from the Whitbread Estate for £110,000 and in October 1916 Short Brothers made proposals for housing the employees required at the airship works. They estimated that for 1917 they would require 800 workers, 500 men and 300 women – of which 200 (mainly women) they hoped to obtain in Bedford. The rest would be housed in an entirely new \\"Garden City\\" type settlement alongside the works. = The Building of Shortstown = By June 1919 the first phase of 151 houses had been built. This consisted of 12 six-roomed houses, 39 five-roomed houses, 64 four- roomed houses and 36 flats of three rooms each. The general layout and the design of the houses and airship works were by the architects Robert Burns Dick and James Cackett, of Cackett & Burns Dick of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Work was carried out by them under the control of the Director of Works, Admiralty, and no local contractors were used. thumbCardington airship sheds, former Short Brothers works housing R100 and R101 airships. Shed no.1 (left) now holds the new aircraft Airlander 10. Shed no.2 (right) is used for creating films that require a large open-space area. 192x192pxThe houses in this initial development are in a simplified neo-Georgian style, mainly red brick with dark red tile roofs, and are more reminiscent of Hampstead Garden Suburb in London than the original Garden City at Letchworth. Although the road layout is fairly formal and most of the houses are terraced, regimentation is avoided by arranging groups of houses around curves in a butterfly pattern or by setting some houses back and some forward in a particular terrace. Further houses were envisaged to the south and west, but in the event, these were not built until many years later and had little regard to the original style and layout. Similarly, the original plan made provision for shops, churches, a cinema and a hall in the centre, but all that was built was a social club. = The Royal Airship Works = As a result of the building of Shortstown, the population of Eastcotts rose from 848 in 1911 to 2,065 by 1921. However, in the meantime, Short Brothers, who were experiencing various difficulties, withdrew from airship manufacture and the Cardington Venture with effect from 1 April 1919 and moved to Rochester in Kent. The Cardington Works was, therefore, taken over directly by the government and renamed the Royal Airship Works, but the associated settlement has retained its original name of Shortstown.186x186pxDuring the 1920s the giant airship R101 was built at Cardington, while its sister ship, the R100 was brought to Cardington in December 1929. The R101 set off for its maiden flight to India on the evening of 4 October 1930 but in the early hours of the next morning, it crashed into a hillside at Beauvais in France, killing all but six of its fifty-four crew and passengers. The shock of this tragedy brought an abrupt end to this phase of British airship manufacture and the R100 was broken up. = Shorts Building = The shorts building was built in 1917. It has taken on many guises ranging from an Administration Block in the early airship days to Station HQ in WW2 and in more recent years as a training centre for the Civil Service. However, despite its many uses, it is still referred to today as The Shorts Building and now over 90 years later has been restored to its former glory as part of the new Bellway development. The building was refurbished in 2011 and a new site called New Cardington was also built. It is now used for 20 residential apartments and has a Public Common Hall, that shows a permanent display of 17 enhanced historic R101 photographs taken from The Airship Heritage Trust collection. There are also additional community rooms and Eastcotts Children's Centre is based here too. 192x192px = RAF Cardington = The Royal Airship Works was put on a care and maintenance basis until 1938 when it was renamed the Balloon Development Establishment. However, the social club at Shortstown was still known as the Royal Airship Works and Shortstown Club in the 1980s. In the meantime, in 1936, an RAF station had opened at Cardington, being particularly concerned with producing gas for barrage balloons and training barrage balloon crews as well as more general training of recruits and NCOs. Throughout the 1940s Cardington remained a busy RAF station and from 1953 it became the RAF's main recruitment centre. After the Second World War, further houses were built at Shortstown as married quarters for RAF personnel. The three avenues off the southern extension of Greycote are named after three prominent victims of the R101 disaster: Brigadier-General Lord Thomson of Cardington, Secretary of state for Air; Air Vice Marshal Sir W. Sefton Brancker, director of Civil aviation at the Air Ministry and Major George Herbert Scott, Assistant director of Airship Development (Flying and Training) at the Royal Airship Works. The roads of the western half of the site are all named after Second World War bomber aircraft. The back of the refurbished Shorts Building.With the ending of National service and cuts in the armed forces the RAF's presence at Cardington began to dwindle and largely disappeared in the 1970s. As a result, the population of Eastcotts declined from 3,675 in 1951 to 1,710 in 1981.  Shortstown today  Since 2012 there has been significant housing development on land to the east of the A600, this part of the village is marketed as New Cardington and Eastcotts Green to appeal as more upmarket than Shortstown. Over half of homes on New Cardington development are for Housing Associations. Since New Cardington homes went on the market, house prices in old Shortstown have risen by more than 20%. Although Bellway homes marketed the development as New Cardington, in fact it remains an extension of Shortstown. In May 2017, Shortstown had its Centenary, which took place in June, called Shortstown Fun Day. There was also a firework display that took place in September and a Centenary Reunion that took place in November. In April 2019 Shortstown became its own civil parish, having previously been part of the parish of Eastcotts.http://www.councillorsupport.bedford.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=23883 Education The first school in Shortstown, built in 1957. Despite houses having been built from 1917 onwards, Shortstown had no school until the mid 1950s. Some children from Shortstown seem to have attended that school as well as going to Cotton End School. Current Shortstown Primary School. The first headmaster of this school was Mr Evans. A road in the village was supposedly named after him. A new school named Shortstown Primary School was built in New Cardington: starting construction in late 2012 and completed in September 2013. This school replaced the old, and now demolished school named Shortstown Lower School, where new houses now stand.

Geography  Nebo is located south-west of the city of Mackay on the Peak Downs Highway, which passes through from south-west to north. The Suttor Developmental Road runs north-west from the Peak Downs Highway.  Economy  The local economy has traditionally relied on coal-mining as it plays a significant role in the local economy, with eleven coal mines located in the Nebo district.  History  Baradha (also known as Barada, Toolginburra, Baradaybahrad, Thararraburra, Toolginburra, Baradha) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Baradha people. The Baradha language region includes the locality of Lotus Creek and extends along the inland ranges towards Nebo and extends along the Connors River catchment. Biri (also known as Birri) is a language of Central and North Queensland. Biri refers to a language chain extending from Central Queensland towards Townsville and is often used as a universal name for other languages and/or dialects across the region. The language area includes the towns of Bowen, Ayr, Collinsville and Nebo. The district was named by explorer William Landsborough, after the Babylonian god Nabu (Hebrew: Nebo). The William Landsborough Diaries (1856-1886) were ranked #39 in the ‘Top 150: Documenting Queensland’ exhibition when it toured to venues around Queensland from February 2009 to April 2010. The exhibition was part of Queensland State Archives’ events and exhibition program which contributed to the state’s Q150 celebrations, marking the 150th anniversary of the separation of Queensland from New South Wales. In 1957 a Memorial stone was erected in the Nebo Shire to honour William Landsborough. Although the name Nebo was widely used for the town, the official name was Fort Cooper until it was eventually changed to Nebo in 1923. Fort Cooper was utilised as a Native Police barracks from 1862 until 1878 from which many punitive expeditions were conducted. Officers such as Robert Arthur Johnstone were deployed to this post and their efficiency in forcing local Aboriginals into submission were appreciated by the local residents and squatters. Pastoralists settled in the Nebo region as early as the 1860s. The Nebo Post Office opened on 1 January 1864. Architectural drawing of the Nebo Police Quarters, 1884 The Nebo Police Station opened in February 1867. In December 1886 new police quarters were built. The Nebo Court of Petty Sessions opened on 29 January 1866. The Nebo Small Debts Court opened on 31 December 1867. Following the Magistrates Courts Act 1921, the Small Debts Court became the Nebo Magistrates Court on 3 April 1922. On 31 December 1964, the Court of Petty Sessions was absorbed into the Magistrates Court. The Magistrates Court closed on 20 December 1990. Nebo Provisional School opened on 29 June 1874. It became Nebo State School in 1909. The Nebo Library facility opened in 1969. Nebo was the administrative centre for the Shire of Nebo until 2008 when the Shire was amalgamated with the Shire of Belyando and the Shire of Broadsound to form the Isaac Region. The Isaac Region is administered from Moranbah, but has council offices in Nebo. At the 2006 census, Nebo had a population of 850. In the 2011 census, Nebo had a population of 840 people.
