He was active during the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius. Cassius Severus, a fearless fighter for freedom of speech, was sharply eloquent against the new governmental order, which finally saw him exiled and his works banned after his death. Life Cassius Severus was said to have risen from a simple background. He was a legendary success as a teacher of rhetoric. He was considered to be very well read. His negative qualities were also apparent. He was sometimes uncontrollably aggressive and cynical in his speeches and also reacted badly to insults. Oratory played a vital role in the social and political life of Rome; rhetoric thus was a vital aspect when Severus was living. The transition from the republican to imperial rule in Rome also brought about changes in the way oratory was conducted. Ciceronian oratory was becoming impossible under the increasing Monarchical rule of Augustus. This necessitated the need to employ a different kind of oratory in the post- Ciceronian world. Cassius Severus was one of those who deviated from the ancient manner decisively and brought in the new style. It was Severus's conscious intention to step into the new era, adapting oratory to the requirement of the new age of imperialism. The manner and style of oratory became more violent and aggressive than previously practiced under the Republic. Steven H. Rutledge in his essay, \\"Delatores and the Tradition of Violence in Roman Oratory,\\" provides a different point of view. He points out the violence in both the republican accusers and delatores speech under the Empire. On the other hand, Marcus Aper and Vipstanus Messalla had different opinions regarding oratory and its contemporary state in ancient Rome. But in the Dialogus de oratoribus of Tacitus, these two men are unanimous at one point in stating that Cassius Severus has had no contribution on the change in oratory from the days of Cicero. In the words of Messalla: He is still known today by the surviving analyses of his speeches by Quintilian, Seneca and Tacitus. All three authors are ambivalent towards him, regarding him to be talented and witty (Quintilian calls him compulsory reading) but at times as too passionate and thus often inordinate and ridiculous. Tacitus uses him as an example to explain the \\"boundary\\" between the rhetoric of the Republic and the Principate,Tacitus, Dialogue on Orators XIX and XXVI and in his Annals he called him: Tacitus raises another issue in oratory-a need for sensitive balance between sharp wit and its abuse in which Cassius Severus was at fault. It can be well comprehended from the quote taken from Paul Plass' Wit and Writing of History: The Rhetoric of Historiography in Imperial Rome. The quote given below indicates the problem of abusive political rhetoric for which Severus is faulted by Tacitus and others can be gauged. Augustus took various steps to stop the flourishing of anti-monarchic sentiments. He stopped the publication of senatorial protocols, poisonous pamphlets; curtailed all oral and written criticism, started book burning in the name of ecclesiastical requirement, made new laws on censorship and so on. Titus Labienus was the first victim on the charge of committing literary treason under lex maiestas. In this case the specific offensive work was destroyed. But in the case of Titus Labienus, all his writings were destined to be destroyed. Tacitus also refers to the law. Augustus made an edict against lampoons, satires and the authors of defamatory writings. To denote it Tacitus refers to the law term - famosos libellos in the first book of his Annals: This intermittent law was first restored by Augustus for his personal safety and the security of the new regime. Cassius Severus, a colleague of Titus Labienus, stood for the cause of Labienus and his writings though he was extremely disliked by Labienus. Cassius Severus exclaimed, \\"If they really want to destroy the works of Labienus, they must burn me alive. For I have learned them by heart!\\"Frederick H. Cramer, The History of Freedom of Speech, p. 175 He also pronounced prophetically, \\"Of humble birth, Titus Cassius Severus worked his way up.\\" He was a sarcastic lawyer. He used to handle cases on civil law as well as on criminal law. He used to handle two cases in the morning and one in the afternoon. Having strong argumentative oratory skill, he did not win always. As a defence lawyer, he only took on cases he felt he would enjoy. He prosecuted Augustus' friend Lucius Nonius Asprenas for poisoning. He was once saved from a lawsuit de moribus by Augustus. Yet, he dwelled upon republican convictions. He established a valid point regarding the declamations-the pale classroom recitations and the Forum Romanum-Rome's traditional rough and ready school for lawyers and magistrates. He had commented: Cassius Severus attacked Rome's social elite of both sexes which roused the emperor's wrath. His support for Labienus meant that it was only a matter of time before Cassius Severus was brought to account and his books too were to be reduced to ashes. The Roman Senate by a formal senatus consultum added the penalty of exile to him on the island of Crete but his property remained unconfiscated. Cassius Severus was however unrepentant and did not ask for mercy. His murderous pen continued to write abuse of the regime. Augustus did not take further cognizance of his victim. After Augustus' death, the case came up again before the senate. The second trial ended with the interdict from fire and water in 24 AD. The decision was to make stubborn, rebellious Severus' life a living death. He was transferred from Crete, his former place of exile to the barren little island of Seriphos. Death emancipated him from his rebellious thirst for freedom. He is said to have died in 32 AD enduring the twenty-fifth year of exile. His writings were banned after his death, only to be republished under Caligula, but his court speeches only survive today in fragments. NotesSources * Steven H. Rutledge: Imperial inquisitions.

The genus is monotypic, with only type species Cearachelys placidoi known.  Etymology  The genus was named for Cear√°, the Brazilian state where the species was discovered. The specific name was named after Placido Nuvens, a director of the Museu Paleontologico de Santana do Cariri.  Description  In 2001, the remains of two mostly complete turtle skeletons from the Early Cretaceous rocks of the Santana Group were used to describe Cearachelys placidoi. Both specimens were from the Romualdo Formation of the group in what is now northwestern Brazil. The type specimen, tentatively labeled MPSC-uncatalogued (for the Museu Paleontologico de Santana do Cariri where the specimen resides), consisted of an incomplete skull, the turtle's shell, a few neck vertebrae and some limb bone fragments. The second specimen, TUTg 1798 is a more complete fossil consisting of most of the turtle's axial and appendicular skeleton. While this specimen hails from the same locality, it was actually procured by the museum eight years prior, in 1993. A fragmentary third specimen was identified in 2007 as belonging to C. placidoi. The specimen, MN-6760-V, consisted of a rather complete fossilized carapace and plastron measuring some 20 cm long. The species was identified as a pleurodire based on a number of distinguishing anatomical characteristics ‚Äì mainly the arrangement of skeletal elements in its skull and the attachment of its pelvic girdle to its carapace. Further analysis of its skull elements led to its classification in the family Bothremydidae. However, skull elements also differentiate the species from the other members of its family. Its closest relation seems to be from a taxon that evolved much later, the Late Cretaceous turtle Galianemys from Morocco. Both genera possess a rather retracted jugal bone, a characteristic not seen in other bothremydids. In a 2006 paper on the phylogeny of extinct pleurodires, Gaffney united the two closely related genera in the tribe Cearachelyini.

It was constructed in 1913‚Äì14, near the junction where the New York, Philadelphia & Norfolk Railroad intersected with the Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railroad (later, the Baltimore & Eastern Railroad) in the center of Salisbury. Both railroads became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad. It has a -story, Flemish bond brick main block covered by a medium-pitched hip roof sheathed in slate, with single-story wings. It was converted from a passenger station into a freight facility around 1958, and since 1986, used for other commercial purposes. The building has characteristics of the Colonial Revival style and was the most elaborate passenger facility to survive on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Union Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Passenger service Until the mid-1950s the Pennsylvania Railroad ran the day train, the Del-Mar-Va Express from Philadelphia in the north, through Salisbury to Cape Charles, Virginia to the southern end of the Delmarva Peninsula. The PRR in the same period operated a night train, the Cavalier on the route. Into the 1930s the Baltimore and Eastern Railroad operated passenger service from Love Point on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay through Salisbury to Ocean City, Maryland.

The first of this gens to obtain the consulship was Aulus Vitellius, uncle of the emperor Vitellius, in AD 32.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 1272 (\\"Vitellii\\"). Origin Suetonius relates two conflicting accounts of the Vitellii, which he ascribes to the emperor's flatterers and his detractors, respectively. According to the first account, the family was descended from Faunus, King of the Aborigines, and Vitellia, who ruled over Latium in the distant past, and were later regarded as two of the indigenous deities. The Vitellii were Sabines, who migrated to Rome under the monarchy, and were enrolled among the patricians. One family of the Vitellii settled at Nuceria Apulorum in the time of the Samnite Wars, and it was from this family that the emperor Vitellius was sprung.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Vitellius\\", 1. A less flattering story reports that the emperor's family was descended from a freedman, a cobbler according to Cassius Severus. His son was a delator, who earned his fortune selling confiscated property, and married a wanton woman, the daughter of a baker named Antiochus. With the help of these ill-gotten gains, his grandson became an eques.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Vitellius\\", 2. Suetonius offers no opinion on which of these accounts is true, other than to say that Publius Vitellius of Nuceria, the emperor's grandfather, was indeed an eques, that he was entrusted with administering the property of Augustus, and that he left four sons, who all made names for themselves in the Roman aristocracy. There were certainly Vitellii mentioned in connection with the earliest days of the Republic, and it is not unlikely that they were patrician, but whether the Vitellii of the Empire were descended from them cannot be determined. There was also an ancient town of Vitellia in Latium, and a road, the Via Vitellia, leading from the Janiculum to the sea.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, vol. II, p. 1313 (\\"Vitellia\\"). Praenomina The Vitellii who appear in history used the praenomina Publius, Quintus, Aulus, and Lucius, all of which were very common at all periods. From inscriptions, some of the family must also have used Gaius. Members * Vitellia, wife of Lucius Junius Brutus, one of the first consuls at the beginning of the Republic, in 509 BC.Livy, ii. 4. * The Vitellii, two senators, nephews of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, and brothers-in-law of Brutus, who conspired with their cousins, the three Aquillii, and two of the sons of Brutus, to restore the Tarquins to the throne.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Poplicola\\", 3. * Quintus Vitellius, one of the duumviri jure dicundo at Ostia in 47 and 45 BC.Fasti Ostienses, . * Aulus Vitellius, duumvir jure dicundo at Ostia in 46 BC. * Quintus Vitellius, a quaestor, probably under Augustus; it is uncertain how or whether he was related to Publius Vitellius, the grandfather of the emperor, and even the era of the Quintus Vitellius referred to is uncertain in this passage. * Quintus Vitellius Q. f., son of Quintus Vitellius and Bassa, buried at Rome in the late first century BC or early first century AD.. * Publius Vitellius, procurator under Augustus, was the grandfather of the emperor.PIR, vol. III, p. 453. * Vitellia, the wife of Aulus Plautius, consul suffectus in 1 BC, and mother of Aulus Plautius, the conqueror and first governor of Britain. She was the mother-in-law of Publius Petronius, consul suffectus in AD 19. * Lucius Vitellius P. f., father of the emperor, was consul in AD 34, and afterward governor of Syria, where his successes excited the jealousy of Caligula. Vitellius evaded certain death by clever flattery, and became one of the chief supporters of Claudius, along whom he served as consul in 43 and 47, and censor in 48. He died in 52, and was buried with great honours.Cassius Dio, lix. 27.Tacitus, Annales, vi. 32, xi. 1‚Äì3, xii. 5. ff, 42.PIR, vol. III, pp. 451, 452. * Publius Vitellius P. f., an officer who served under Germanicus in his campaigns against the Chatti. He prosecuted Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso for the murder of Germanicus, but in AD 31 he was accused as one of the associates of Sejanus, and perished before he could be brought to trial.Tacitus, Annales, i. 70, ii. 6, 74, iii. 10, 13, 17, 19, v. 8, vi. 47PIR, vol. 453, 454. * Aulus Vitellius P. f., consul suffectus from the Kalends of July in AD 32, is said to have been given to luxury and extravagant feats. He died during his term of office.PIR, vol. III, p. 449. * Quintus Vitellius P. f., a senator, deprived of his rank by Tiberius, who ostensibly wished to rid the senate of those who squandered their fortunes and led dissolute lives.Tacitus, Annales, ii. 48. * Aulus Vitellius A. f. (P. n.), probably the son of Aulus Vitellius, the consul of AD 32, named on a monument dedicated to his father.. * Vitellius Proculus, a soldier in the army of Publius Petronius, governor of Syria in AD 39.Josephus, Antiquitates Juda√Øcae, xix. 6.PIR, vol. III, p. 454. * Lucius Vitellius L. f. P. n., brother of the emperor, was consul suffectus from the Kalends of July in AD 48, the year in which his father and the emperor Claudius were censors. In the Year of the Four Emperors, he mounted a formidable campaign in support of his brother, but the collapse of Vitellian support at Rome sealed his fate; he was captured and put to death by Vespasian.Tacitus, Historiae, iii. 37, 76 ff, iv. 2.Cassius Dio, lxv. 22.PIR, vol. III, p. 452. * Aulus Vitellius L. f. P. n., consul in AD 48, and subsequently proconsul of Africa. He was proclaimed emperor by the soldiers on the death of Otho in 69, but overthrown by Vespasian in the same year.Tacitus, Historiae, ii, iii.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Vitellius\\", passim.Cassius Dio, lxv.Tillemont, Histoire des Empereurs, i.PIR, vol. III, pp. 449‚Äì451. * Publius Vitellius Saturninus, prefect of one of Otho's legions.Tacitus, Historiae, i. 82. * Vitellius A. f. L. n. Petronianus, son of the emperor Vitellius by his first wife, Petronia. According to Suetonius, he was blind in one eye, and would inherit a fortune from his mother upon adulthood; Vitellius manumitted him, and was widely believed to have poisoned him, claiming that Petronianus had intended to kill his father, but had then taken the poison himself out of remorse.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Vitellius\\", 6. * Vitellius A. f. L. n. Germanicus, son of the emperor by his second wife, Galeria Fundana, was six years old when his father claimed the throne. After the Vitellians had been defeated, Vespasian's ally, Mucianus, had him put to death, in order to preclude his use in future rebellions. Suetonius reports that he was severely afflicted by a stammer.Tacitus, Historiae, ii. 59, iii. 66‚Äì68, iv. 80.PIR, vol. III, pp. 453, 454. * Vitellia, daughter of the emperor, and wife of Decimus Valerius Asiaticus, consul designatus for AD 70. When her husband died before entering his consulship, the emperor Vespasian arranged for her to remarry, and provided her with a dowry. Her son, Decimus Valerius Asiaticus Saturninus, was consul suffectus in AD 94.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Vespasian\\", 14. * Quintus Vitellius Eclogius, supposed by Casaubon to have been a freedman of the emperor Vitellius, and the author of the genealogy referred to by Suetonius at the beginning of his \\"Life of Vitellius\\". It is unclear from the original passage precisely when this genealogy was compiled, although it could be interpreted as referring to individuals living during the time of Augustus.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 4 (\\"Quintus Eclogius or Eulogius\\"). * Vitellia C. f. Rufilla, the wife of Gaius Salvius Liberalis, consul suffectus in AD 85.. * Publius Vitellius Saturninus, one of the Arval Brethren in AD 122, possibly a son of the Vitellius Saturninus who served under Otho.Acts of the Arval Brethren. * Vitellius, a legal writer, mentioned several times by Ulpian. * Vitellius Honoratus, summoned to Rome as a witness against Marius Priscus, proconsul of Africa in AD 100. He was accused of bribing Priscus to exile an eques, and put seven of his friends to death, by the payment of three hundred thousand sestertii, but Honoratus died before he could testify.Pliny the Younger, Epistulae, ii. 11. * Vitellius, consul suffectus in AD 189.PIR, vol.

It dates back to the earliest periods of Presbyterian church government in the Church of Scotland in the late 16th century. The Presbytery of Glasgow currently has 125 congregations, making it by far the largest Presbytery in the Church of Scotland. Congregations vary in location from suburbs and urban priority areas (representing part of the poorest 5% of Scotland‚Äôs population) to outlying towns and villages. The Presbytery boundaries extend beyond the City of Glasgow to include parts of four other local authority areas (East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire). Presbyterianism As a Presbyterian church, the Church of Scotland has no bishops. Instead courts of ministers, elders and deacons have collective responsibility for the governance of the church. The Presbytery is the intermediate court of the church, subject to the General Assembly and responsible for the oversight of Kirk Sessions (at a congregational level.) As with all courts of the Church, the Presbytery is chaired by an annually elected Moderator. Moderator of the Presbytery Each year Presbytery nominates a Moderator to serve for one year. The Moderator begins their term in June, and represents the Presbytery at church, ecumenical, inter-denominational and civic events, among others. In 2003-2004, the Rev Adah Younger (minister at Dennistoun Central Parish Church) became the first woman to be Moderator of the Presbytery. Presbytery meetings The Presbytery meets each month (except January, July and August). Twice a year, smaller regional meetings are held covering a number of topics. All meeting dates, times and venues are advertised on the Presbytery website (www.presbyteryofglasgow.org.uk). Presbytery structure The Presbytery is based around a committee structure made up of: Community Responsibility; Ecumenical Relations & Interfaith Matters; Education; Learning & Nurture; Ministry; Mission; Nominations; Property; Staffing; Stewardship & Finance; Strategic Planning; Superintendence (including Safeguarding); World Mission; and Worship. Presbytery Clerk The Presbytery Clerk is Rev George S. Cowie, formerly parish Minister at South Holburn in Aberdeen Presbytery , who also serves as a Chaplain in Ordinary to Her Majesty the Queen. Previous Presbytery Clerks include Very Rev Bill Hewitt (Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland 2009-2010), Rev Dr Graham Blount, Rev Dr Angus Kerr, and Very Rev Dr David Lunan, (Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland 2008-2009).

Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the factory on the eve of volume production, along with dignitaries from the state of Michigan and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. 20,000 Sibers were planned for production in 2008, with 40,000 planned for 2009. Eventual yearly production was desired to reach the plant capacity of 100,000 vehicles per year. On 29 August 2008, GAZ began fleet sales of the Siber, to government employees and businesses including Russian bank Sberbank. The assembly tooling was dismantled in Detroit and shipped to Russia, where it was reassembled. The transplanted GAZ plant assembly line approximated the layout of the former Chrysler plant, with assembly workers having completed a comprehensive professional training program abroad. Engineers from Magna International assisted in transfer of the assembly line and employee training. The first vehicle type to be manufactured in the new plant was the Siber. At first, mostly imported parts were used in vehicle assembly; domestic components were used only when their quality was at least as good as their imported counterparts.

Rear view Due to the economic crisis in 2008 and 2009, demand for Siber fell and production ended in November 2010. In total, about 9,000 cars were produced during the 2008‚Äì2010 production run.

His moniker was The Quick Brown Fox. Career Brown played for a diverse set of colleges in the United States. His performances became notable that he would later be drafted by the Houston Rockets for the 59th overall pick in the 3rd Round of the 1979 NBA Draft. Though he was not signed to any team, Brown continued to play collegiate basketball, eventually being discovered by Eduardo Cojuangco Jr. in the United States and would thereafter move to the Philippines. He had a notable career playing for the De La Salle Green Archers during many different tournaments in 1982. He would simultaneously enroll and take classes there for the remainder of the year before declaring his intention to enter the PBA. A year after his notable college career in DLSU, Brown moved on to play professional basketball in the PBA in 1983. It was here where he became famous in the professional stage as the first-ever Filipino-American to play as a 'local' in the league. He was the 1983 Rookie of the Year and 1985 MVP. He was also included in the Mythical Five selection in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1988. In 1983, he was only the 2nd player ever to win the coveted Rookie of the Year Award and also be named to the Mythical Five Team. In that same Rookie Year, Ricky was in a close race for league MVP with teammate Bogs Adornado and eventual MVP, Abet Guidaben. In 1985, Ricky's best year in the PBA, The Quick Brown Fox was simply awesome. He regularly scored more than 30 points per game as well as have double figures in assists. His high game that year was 56 points against Ginebra, but what many people forget is that Ricky had back-to-back 40+ games in the PBA Open Championship versus Norman Black and Magnolia. Ricky was selected the MVP of that Championship Series, which was the 3rd straight title for powerhouse Great Taste Coffee team. During Ricky's somewhat brief career in the PBA (only 7 years and 19 Conferences), Ricky played for the Great Taste Coffee Makers and the San Miguel Beermen, where he won a total of 7 championships during his PBA career. His ball handling skills, without question head and shoulders more advanced than any Filipino in the PBA during that era, his ability to evade defenders with intelligence and quickness, the skillset to score at will from anywhere on the court, and great presence and vision on the court to produce pin point assists made him one of the best point guards and combo guards ever to play in the PBA. Even though Ricky last played more than 27 years ago, he still holds the All-time PBA career scoring average (23.1 ppg) and PBA All-time Best Assist Average (7.3 per game), as well as the best FT percentage over a career at 87.9%. In 1989, the year of San Miguel's Grand Slam (three championships in one year), he was an integral member of a powerhouse squad that included future Hall of Famers Hector Calma, Samboy Lim, and Ramon Fernandez. Brown would eventually go down in PBA history as one of the finest players and sportsmen to ever grace the hardcourts of the Philippines. Legacy In 2000, Brown was named a member of the PBA's 25 Greatest Players. In 2009, he was inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame along with former teammates Allan Caidic, Samboy Lim, and Hector Calma. Ricky's honors in the PBA are numerous. Among these awards include Rookie of the Year and Mythical Five (1983) in the same year becoming only the 2nd player to ever achieve that honor; a Mythical Five selection in 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1988; Most Valuable Player in 1985; and 7 PBA Championships with both Great Taste and San Miguel Beer. To this day, Ricky still holds the highest career average for points per game (23) and assists (7) and the highest FT percentage. Personal life Brown's parents were married in Manila in 1945 and moved to the United States the next year. His father Lee Brown was an American serviceman and a former major leaguer with the St. Louis Cardinals in the MLB. Brown's mother, the former Conrada Vidal, had a family-owned photography shop in Santa Cruz, Manila. Brown has two brothers and a sister born in the Philippines. Ricardo is married to the former Lorma Sahagun, a Filipina from Ilocos Norte, and has two sons, Justin and Kevan. Kevan was born in Cardinal Santos Hospital in Greenhills, San Juan, located in Metro Manila. In other media Brown made a movie with the comedy king, Dolphy, in 1987 titled Action is Not Missing, which was an entry to the Metro Manila Film Festival and a box-office hit. Post-retirement Ricky has been in education since 1981, first as a teacher, then a dean of students, assistant principal, and principal. In 2008, he became the first Filipino-American principal in the ABC Unified School District. Brown remained principal at Ross Academy of Creative and Media Arts, a school that became a California School To Watch and a California Gold Ribbon School during his tenure, for nine years. In June 2017, Brown became principal of Tracy High School, a Continuation School and Alternative Education Program, also in the ABC Unified School District. In 2019, Tracy was selected as a California Model Continuation School for excellence in providing a quality education and experience for its students.

The company specialises in the recording of live shows by stand-up comedians who, while in the public eye, may not normally be able to get a DVD released through a major label, or who want to avoid forms of censorship that they feel may come with mainstream releases. Initially a baby clothes retailer, the company used its internet presence to diversify into comedy releases in 2005. Go Faster Stripe are closely associated with Stewart Lee and Richard Herring, who first became famous as the Lee and Herring double act in the 1990s, and whose work they have often published. In addition to Herring and Lee, the company has produced media for acts such as Simon Munnery, Lucy Porter and Robin Ince. As well as CDs and DVDs, they have also released a 10\\" vinyl and a number of books.  History  When comedy fan Chris Evans wished to purchase a DVD of comedian Stewart Lee's (co-writer of Jerry Springer: The Opera) latest live show (90s Comedian) he learned there would not be one: the comic's previous release (Stewart Lee - Stand Up Comedian, released by 2 Entertain) had sold insufficient copies for a major label to consider a future release profitable. Furthermore, the comedy website Chortle claimed that the show's controversial content dissuaded major distribution companies because of fear of retribution from the fundamentalist Christian movement. However, Evans felt that the critically acclaimed show should be recorded. He used the name of his existing clothes retail company, Go Faster Stripe, to produce a CD of the show. The CD sold well enough to generate a profit, and Evans quickly shifted the business towards comedy material. Initially specialising in the work of Lee and Herring, Go Faster Stripe has since diversified into a broader range of comedians. In 2014, Chris Evans won the Chortle Award for best offstage contribution.http://www.chortle.co.uk/awards/2014/01/10/19382/chortle_awards Censorship and Policy Go Faster Stripe claim to only release material by comedians whose work they enjoy. Recently, this has involved returning to previously unreleased work, such as Lee and Herring's television show Fist of Fun. So far around 50% of the comedians that have been approached by Go Faster Stripe have had their work recorded. The company does not ask artists to change their show, and does not censor material. For example, in Richard Herring's m√©nage √† un, he talks explicitly about being masturbated via the hole in the hand of Jesus Christ, which Herring claims would most likely have been edited for a mainstream DVD release. In an interview with Australian comedy listings guide The Groggy Squirrel, Richard Herring said of Go Faster Stripe: > Go Faster don't tell us what we can or can't say and are happy to give > faithful representations of the material.

He was the son of the eques Publius Vitellius, and belonged to the gens Vitellia. The emperor Vitellius was his nephew.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Vitellius\\", 2. Career In AD 15, Vitellius accompanied Germanicus on his second campaign in Germania. During the retreat, Germanicus handed over command of the second and fourteenth legions to Vitellius. The journey back was disastrous, however, with many of the units' troops drowned in a flood.Tacitus, Annales i. 70. One year later, while Germanicus was preparing for his third and largest campaign in Germania, he sent Vitellius and Gaius Antius to Gaul to collect taxes.Tacitus, Annales, ii. 6. On Germanicus's suspicious death in the year 19, Vitellius was among the prosecutors of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, finally convicted of Germanicus's murder, and Tacitus praises Vitellius' eloquence in the trial.Tacitus, Annales iii. 13. Vitellius was later among the supporters of Sejanus, and upon the latter's downfall in the year 31, Vitellius was also indicted for complicity, having been Sejanus' prefect of the military treasury. Vitellius was given into the custody of his brother (Suetonius does not say which one), where anticipating the worst, he opened his veins with a penknife. Tacitus writes simply that Publius died, but Suetonius states that he was persuaded by pleas from his family and friends to be bandaged and treated; however, he died soon afterward from natural causes.Tacitus, Annales v. 8.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Vitellius\\", 2.

Collegiate career Hubalde played college ball for the Map√∫a Institute of Technology, before eventually moving on to play professional basketball in the PBA. He also has the distinction of being one of the few NCAA high school players playing for the senior team during his stay with Mapua. Professional career Hubalde started his PBA career with the Crispa Redmanizers, and was part of two Crispa grand slam teams in 1976 and 1983. He was a low key but reliable offensive player who could turn the game around with his deadly shooting both from the perimeter and, in his later years, from three-point range. He became famous for his off-the-glass jumpers and tight undergoal stabs (\\"dukot\\"). On defense, he utilized his patented \\"back tap\\" when stripping the player he is guarding of possession. In 1977, he was the awarded as the league's season Most Valuable Player. When Crispa folded at the end of the 1984 season, he and Crispa teammate Abet Guidaben moved to Tanduay and instantly transformed the team into a playoff contender. Before the start of the 1985 Third Conference, Guidaben was traded to Manila Beer in exchange for Ramon Fernandez, thus ushering a bright new era for the team still in search of a championship. In the 1986 Reinforced (First) Conference, Tanduay, now led by himself and Fernandez with supporting casts point guard Willie Generalao, forwards Jayvee Yango and Padim Israel and imports Rob Williams and Andre McKoy, finally won its first ever PBA title. With his steady play and clutch shooting, he led Tanduay to its second title the following conference, capturing the All-Filipino championship at the expense of Robert Jaworski and Ginebra San Miguel. In the title-clinching game, he sank two free throws off a Jaworski foul in the waning seconds to win the game for Tanduay. Tanduay would fail in its bid for a grand slam as Ginebra easily won the Open (Third) Conference, thanks to its devastating import combination in Billy Ray Bates and Michael Hackett. The Rhum Makers, however, would bounce back the following year as they dominated the 1987 Open (First) Conference with former Celtic David Thirdkill as import en route to their third championship in the last four conferences. This would be his 16th and last championship (He won 13 with Crispa) in the PBA, making him the second winningest behind Fernandez's 19. In 2000, he was named a member of the PBA's 25 Greatest Players. Personal life Hubalde is the father of basketball players Frederick \\"Derrick\\" Hubalde and Paolo Hubalde.

It has an area of 469 hectares and had a population of 6,498 in the 2001 census, increasing to 7,454 at the 2011 Census. The area is dominated by the Moss Valley, which was known for its coal mining. Today it is operated as a country park, and there is a golf course of the same name in the vicinity. History Broughton was recorded in the reign of Henry VII as one of the townships of the manor of Eglwysegle (a name preserved in the area known as Eglwyseg near Llangollen), part of the lordship of Bromfield. The Wrexham historian Alfred Neobard Palmer noted: > Three villages [called Broughton] are situated in that part of Wales which > was settled by Englishmen. They appear in Domesday as \\"Brochetune\\" or > \\"Broctune,\\" which can hardly mean anything else than \\"Brook-town\\". The brook > which may have given the Bromfield Broughton its name is now almost always > dry, but \\"Rhyd Broughton\\" (or Broughton ford) preserves the memory of > it.Palmer, A. N. and Owen, E. A History of Ancient Tenures of Land in North > Wales and the Marches, 2nd ed, 1910, p.245 Under the ecclesiastical administration the township of Broughton was part of the parish of Wrexham, and later of Brymbo. Population changes led to it being made a parish in its own right in 1909. The corresponding civil parish of Broughton, which was ultimately based on the boundaries of the ancient township, became the community of Broughton under the terms of the Local Government Act 1972. It today contains the villages of Moss, Pentre Broughton, Brynteg, New Broughton, Southsea and Caego. The majority of the villages date from the 19th century, when the area became heavily industrialised through coal mining and its proximity to the Brymbo Steelworks. A number of coal mines were located in the area known as Moss Valley, along with a number in Pentre Broughton near Brymbo such as the Brynmally and Pwll Cadi collieries. Most of the area's coal mines had closed by the 1930s and the Moss Valley has now been reclaimed as a park. Continuing development has urbanised much of the rest of the community's area, with some agricultural land remaining in the south and east. The Moss Valley Golf Club was built in the 1980s by five designers, and was initially run by the local council. References * Davies, John; Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines & Peredur I.

The wall began to smoulder and a fire broke out in the roof of the Small Throne Room of the Winter Palace. The dry waxed floors and the oil-painted fretwork caught fire immediately. The Court were at the Mikhailovsky Theatre when an aide-de-camp entered the imperial box and informed Prince Volkonsky, one of the ministers then present.Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, 1851, p. 158 The prince gave him orders and continued to look quietly on at the performance. Half-an-hour later the aide-de-camp returned, and this time the prince spoke to the Emperor Nicholas I. To prevent the fire from spreading to the Hermitage, Nicholas I called for the immediate dismantling of the gallery roofs which joined the Hermitage with the main building. However, the fire fighting was hindered when the privy-councillor of the Empress, Chambeau, stated: \\"Everything here belongs to the Empress!

Since 2011 she has been a Professorial Research Fellow at the Centre for Policy Studies and the Institute for the Study of Civil Society (Civitas), and a Visiting Professor at the Social Science Research Center Berlin. Career and work Hakim has published extensively on labour market topics, women's employment, sex discrimination, social and family policy, as well as social statistics and research design. She has published over 100 articles in academic journals and edited collections, and over a dozen textbooks and research monographs. She is best known for developing preference theory Republished in 2008, volume 2, pdf. and her criticism of many feminist assumptions about women's employment. Her most recent books develop a theory of \\"erotic capital\\". and its power in all social interaction, in the workplace, politics and in public life generally as well as in the invisible negotiations of private relationships. Hakim is a member of the editorial boards of the European Sociological Review and International Sociology. = The idea of erotic capital = Catherine Hakim's perspective  Catherine Hakim states that erotic capital is an asset in many social and economic settings such as media and politics. This theory added erotic as an additional form of capital to Pierre Bourdieu's concept of society being run by four main types of capita - cultural, social, symbolic, and economic. Hakim defined erotic capital as the concept that an individual's beauty, sexual attractiveness, enhanced social interaction, liveliness, social presentation, sexuality, and fertility can provide opportunities to advance in life. According to Hakim, the most important and most controversial of these seven components would be sexual attractiveness, as her studies indicated that family men tend to crave sex more than women, a phenomenon she named the male sex deficit. She encouraged young women to use this asset to earn a more respectable position in society. Hakim believes that erotic capital has gone unacknowledged for far too long and that the patriarchal society and moral constraints of conservative communities have caused the idea of beauty and attractiveness to stress the importance of personality, not giving enough credit to physique. She doesn't encourage a society based on solely erotic capital but rather states that it plays a subconscious role in daily life decisions, such as career offerings, enrichment opportunities, and social networking. For example, she places current dating apps and social media on the spotlight, stating that the internet has created somewhat of a digitized version of dating and that these markets will gain traction as time goes on. She strongly believes that these sites and the decision of marriage are driven by a woman's erotic capital and a man's economic capital.  Contradictions  Many groups such as feminists have actively rejected the idea of erotic capital by stating that the sex positive movement highlights the rights of women in only a manner that highlights advantages and ignores contradictory research that has shown that attractive women are less likely to receive a promotion. Many sociologists assert that Bourdieu had already stated this phenomenon is not a capital but a mere search for recognition and a drive of socialized desire from fellow peers, family, and friends. Bourdieu's followers have also asserted that he had developed the idea of 'body capital' long ago but refused to include in his general capita because it was too intertwined with economic capital. For example, if a woman from a high socioeconomic status could buy beauty products and afford body shaping surgeries, she would be able to change her body capital. Sex deficit In 2017, Hakim was accused of misogyny after publishing an article which critics claim suggested women are to blame for sexual assault. The article bases its argument on a research paper published in 2015 Pdf. which evaluated 30 sex surveys globally and claimed that, since the 1960s sexual revolution, women‚Äôs sexual motivation and interest has decreased, causing what Hakim calls a \\"male sexual deficit\\". This, it is argued, can help explain why sexual harassment, sexual violence, rape, rising demand for commercial sexual services and other behaviours are almost exclusively male. She has argued that the sex deficit also derives from men naturally having a higher sex drive than women.

Early life and education Ocampo was born in Pampanga, Philippines on October 5, 1938. He was one of four children of renowned architect Fernando H. Ocampo and Lourdes Luciano. He was educated at the Ateneo de Manila (GS 1951, HS 1955, BSBA 1959). Playing careerFootball= During his grade school years, Ocampo became interested in basketball and football. He tried out for the grade school basketball team but did not pass the height requirement. Instead, he made it to the football squad where his brilliance in the field became much apparent. By the age of seventeen, Ocampo was acclaimed by sportswriters as ‚ÄúMr. Football‚Äù. He was a member of the Philippine football team that toured Korea and Spain in 1956. =Track and field= He was also active in track and field during his school years. =Basketball= In 1956, Ocampo broke his clavicle during a football game and was advised by doctors to cease from sports for six months. While recuperating, Ocampo decided to join the school‚Äôs basketball team. Ocampo officially joined the team during the second round of the 1957 NCAA basketball season. He led the team to back-to-back NCAA men's basketball championships in 1957 and 1958. Ocampo became the first team captain to be called King Eagle.The Guidon, August 1988. After graduation in 1959, he joined the fabled YCO Painters in the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association during its prime era. He was part of the YCO championship teams of the 1960s and remained with the franchise until 1973/1974. Philippine men‚Äôs basketball team Ocampo was a regular member of the Philippines men's national basketball team from 1959 to 1972. He first joined the Philippine team that placed 8th at the 1959 FIBA World Championship held in Chile and was a member of three Philippine teams that won the Asian Basketball Confederation championships - 1960, 1963 and 1967. He was also a three-time Olympian - 1960 (11th place), 1968 (13th place) and 1972 (13th place). Ocampo was mentioned in Jose Ma. Bonifacio Escoda's book, Basketball History: Philippines, as one of the finest guards the country has ever produced and a gentleman in and outside the hard court. Though not a scorer, his leech-like guarding helped the national team of 1967 to regain the ABC crown by limiting Shin Dong-pa, South Korea's six-foot-one scoring machine to just 12 points. Coaching career Ocampo began his coaching career with the YCO Painters in 1975, winning the MICAA championship that year against Manila Bank in July. He became head coach of Royal Tru-Orange in the Philippine Basketball Association in 1978 and won his first PBA championship during the 1979 PBA Open conference. This was the first PBA championship of the San Miguel Corporation franchise, currently the franchise with the most number of PBA championships (25). In 1981, Ocampo became head coach of Toyota and won three more PBA championships. He later coached Manila Beer (1985), Shell (1986-1987) and Pepsi (1990). Personal life Ocampo was married to the former Maria Lourdes Trinidad. Death Ocampo died on July 29, 1992 at the age of 53.

Early humorous reference to WMDs A 1955 episode of the radio comedy series Hancock's Half Hour, titled \\"The Chef That Died of Shame\\", contains a joke about a UN delegate wanting a chef's dumplings added to a list of \\"Banned Weapons of Mass Destruction\\". Nuclear weapons as a central theme in movies Nuclear weapons have been a central theme of movies since The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951); two of the most famous are Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) and Fail-Safe (1964). Biological weapons have also featured, as in Twelve Monkeys (1995). Several early James Bond films involve a madman, most notably Ernst Stavro Blofeld of the fictional terrorist organization S.P.E.C.T.R.E., who intends to use either nuclear or biological weapons in the quest for world domination. This has been parodied in the Austin Powers series with Dr. Evil. In science fiction The mocking of the term \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" dates back well before the Iraq War, with Hugh Cook's 1992 fantasy novel The Witchlord and the Weaponmaster satirically mentioned that the avalanche is a terrible weapon of mass destruction, outlawed by civilised countries in the conduct of war. The novel Dune discusses atomic weapons, and its sequel Dune Messiah employs one called a Stone Burner. In the Star Wars universe, the Death Star is a moveable, multi-use WMD (meaning that it, unlike most WMD missiles, can be used thousands of times.) capable of destroying entire planets. In the Babylon 5 universe, WMDs have been used a number of times, most directly by the Earth Alliance (the Earth-Minbari War uses nuclear weapons), the Army of Light (the Shadow War, also nuclear), the Centauri (Narn-Centauri War, planetary bombardment with asteroids by mass drivers), as well as on their own planet on the Isle of Selini to rid themselves of the Shadows (nuclear), and the Drakh (biological warfare against Earth). In \\"Scorpion\\", a 1997 episode of Star Trek: Voyager, Captain Janeway describes the Borg's multikinetic neutronic mine as a weapon of mass destruction. In many real-time strategy video games, each playable army would be able to construct a WMD or 'superweapon' to use in battle, which can be similar to WMDs found today or different from current technology. The invasion of Iraq in search of Sadam Hussein's alleged WMDs In the context of the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq under the guise of Saddam Hussein's alleged WMDs, the phrase became ubiquitous. A parodyCannot find Weapons of Mass Destruction based on Internet Explorer's \\"404 Not Found\\" message was created, poking fun at the state of international affairs, and for a time was the #1 hit for the Google search \\"weapons of mass destruction\\". Similarly, at the annual Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner, February 24, 2004, George W. Bush joked about being unable to find WMD in Iraq, saying \\"Those weapons of mass destruction must be somewhere\\", while showing images of himself searching the White House for something. In 2003 an EasyJet advertising campaign attracted controversy with a billboard ad featuring a woman's breasts with the phrase \\"discover weapons of mass distraction\\". Sue Townsend continued her best- selling series of comic-political novels with the 2004 Adrian Mole and the Weapons of Mass Destruction. The eponymous hero trusts Tony Blair implicitly, and writes to him asking for proof of the WMDs' existence, so he can get a refund from the travel agency where he had deposited some money for a holiday in Cyprus, since this island is now apparently no longer safe to travel to. In the 2004 episode of The Sopranos, titled \\"All Happy Families...\\", a parole inspector asks Feech Le Manna to open his garage., where Feech has hidden contraband that, if found, could return him to prison. Feech quips, \\"that's where I make my weapons of mass destruction\\", in hopes the inspector will be dissuaded by the pop culture reference to the United States' inability to find Sadam Hussein's WMDs in Iraq. Weapons of Mass Destruction is the title of an album released by American rapper Xzibit in 2004, who also called a car featured on Pimp My Ride a WMD. Faithless released the album No Roots in 2004 which contained the single \\"Mass Destruction\\", whose lyrics describe negative traits such as fear, racism, greed and inaction as \\"weapons of mass destruction\\". The 2005 series, Doctor Who, contained a double episode about an alien invasion in London. In one scene, when discussing whether or not an attack on the aliens' space craft was warranted, politicians claimed it was necessary because the aliens had \\"massive weapons of destruction\\" which could be deployed \\"within forty-five seconds\\"a reference to Prime Minister Tony Blair's claim in the lead-up to the Iraq War that Saddam Hussein had WMDs could be deployed within 45 minutes. In The Simpsons \\"Treehouse of Horror XVII\\", aliens Kang and Kodos, spoofing the Iraq War, claim that they had to invade, as Earth was working on \\"Weapons of Mass Disintegration.\\" In the episode (\\"Rekognize\\") of Da Ali G Show, Ali mistakenly refers to WMDs as \\"BLTs\\" (an acronym for the popular sandwich made of bacon, lettuce, and tomato), going so far as to ask if there was mustard gas in the BLTs. In 2005, the Paranoia RPG published a collection of new Straight-style missions under the title \\"WMD\\". Each mission revolved around a plot device with the initials WMD. At least one of the missions involved an actual device that might have been a WMD; but, in general they simply focused on situations rife with a sense of stress, uncertainty and fear. The American TV series 24 typically features a different weapon of mass destruction in each season: the second, fourth and sixth seasons feature nuclear weapons, the third and seventh feature weaponized viruses, and the fifth, VX nerve gas, a chemical weapon of mass destruction. In the Nextwave comic book the Beyond Corporation¬© is testing out \\"Unusual Weapons of Mass Destruction\\" within the US, starting with a weapon called Fin Fang Foom. In the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops and Call of Duty: Black Ops II, there is a map named Nuketown in which a nuclear bomb goes off in the background when a round ends. Additionally, in the first game's singleplayer story, the USA is under the threat of a national attack from a German-Soviet chemical called \\"Nova 6\\", a green nerve toxin that kills nearly instantly as it is inhaled. The premise of the Metal Gear video game series involves various iterations of the titular bipedal nuclear missile launcher, presenting a constant struggle to decrease the global quantity of nuclear warheads as well as destroying the featured mech presented in its respective game. The Big Show uses a Knockout punch called WMD. Biological WMDs The 2008 literary thriller The Quick and The Dead by Matthew John Lee describes the aftermath of an attack on the British Isles using an enhanced smallpox virus. .

The book was published by Gibson Square and edited by Martin Rynja. Mitford's sister, Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, provides the introduction. The title is a homage to another Mitford sister's book, Nancy Mitford's The Pursuit of Love. Overview The book includes several of her articles, diaries and book reviews previously published in The European, a cultural magazine she also edited during its tenure in the 1950s. Similar works published for publications such as Tatler, London Evening Standard, The Spectator, The Daily Mail, The Times, The Sunday Times and Books & Bookmen have also been republished. The collection also includes selected portraits from her 1977 autobiography, A Life of Contrasts and her 1985 publication of pen portraits, Loved Ones. Reception The book received a wide UK release in December 2008 and was generally favorably reviewed, although several reviewers were not able to reconcile Mitford's previous association with the Nazi regime. The book has also been satirized by the \\"Digested Read\\" column in The Guardian. Valerie Grove of The Times attempted to distance herself from any political position in reviewing the book \\"I hope I can praise Diana Mosley without being suspected of fascist sympathies\\". She continued with praise \\"Her opening gambits are arresting...Dipping into this book at your bedside is like browsing in a great nonfiction library stuffed with lives and letters, each subject brightly and sharply illuminated.\\" David Sexton of the Evening Standard described the book as \\"Sharp, funny, debunking.\\" But he criticized her political positions citing \\"her completely unrepentant support not just of her beloved Mosley but of \\"the F√ºhrer\\" as she continued to call him (attentive to titles, she liked to snub Churchill by referring to him as \\"Mr Churchill\\") is ultimately indefensible and that fact has to be faced, not sidestepped or swept under the carpet.\\" The Pursuit of Laughter (review) Evening Standard, 5 January 2009 Writing in the Daily Telegraph reviewer Duncan Fallowell questioned Mosley's contradictions between her personal and political life. Fallowell described the publication; \\"this strange, fascinating book revives the turbulence at a time when the Mitford industry seemed to be moving into a cosy corner. It is made up mostly of book reviews but her agile mind and the sulphurous life lend them weight.\\"Nazi but nice 30 December 2008.

He was most recently the head football coach at Vanderbilt University, a position he held from the 2002 season until his retirement in 2010. In December 2001, Johnson became the Commodores' head coach, after leading Furman University to the NCAA Division I-AA national championship game. He coached the Paladins between 1994 and 2001, leading the team to a 60‚Äì36 overall record during his eight years. Prior to his hiring at Furman, Johnson was the defensive coordinator for the Clemson Tigers. In 2008, Johnson led Vanderbilt to its first winning season since 1982. His team went 7‚Äì6 with a 16‚Äì14 win over Boston College in the Music City Bowl, Vanderbilt's first bowl victory since 1955 and only their second in school history at the time. Playing career and education Johnson was a standout in football, basketball, and baseball during his time at Eau Claire High School in his native hometown of Columbia, South Carolina. He continued his success in football at college, where he played both wide receiver and cornerback for Clemson University. In the 1971 and 1972 seasons, Johnson led the Tigers in interceptions. Johnson was twice named as an ACC All-Academic honoree. He graduated from Clemson in 1973, earning his Bachelor of Science degree in management, before earning his master's degree in education from Furman in 1979. Coaching careerVanderbilt= On December 23, 2001, Johnson was officially announced as the 25th head coach of the Vanderbilt Commodores football team. 2005 In Johnson's fourth season, the Commodores finished 5‚Äì6. Jay Cutler, the team's offensive captain that season, was drafted #11 overall by the Denver Broncos and named as starting quarterback during his rookie season. 2006 In the 2006 season, Vanderbilt fell to 4‚Äì8 after the loss of Cutler, but did beat Georgia at Sanford Stadium. In addition, Vanderbilt lost games to Ole Miss, Alabama, SEC West champion Arkansas, and eventual national champion Florida. After eight games Atlanta Journal-Constitution college football writer Tony Barnhart stated that Johnson \\"deserves some consideration\\" for SEC Coach of the Year, albeit based on a misstated record of 4‚Äì5 instead of 3‚Äì5. Barnhart's 2006 postseason survey of ten former SEC coaches ranked the Vanderbilt job the least attractive in the SEC. Former Ole Miss coach Billy Brewer summarized Johnson's performance: \\"The tough thing about the Vanderbilt job is that you can improve a lot from year to year and still finish last in the SEC East. For what he has, I think Bobby Johnson does a heck of a coaching job.\\" 2007 Johnson again led the Commodores to success in 2007, with SEC conference wins over Mississippi and South Carolina, ranked #6 at the time of the contest. Standing with a 5‚Äì5 record, the Commodores then squandered a 24‚Äì9 third-quarter lead against in- state rival Tennessee, losing 25‚Äì24 after a 49-yard Bryant Hahnfeldt field goal attempt that would have won the game glanced off the left upright. Concluding the season with an uninspired effort versus Wake Forest, Vanderbilt finished 5‚Äì7 and one win short of bowl eligibility. 2008 Vanderbilt started the 2008 season on a 5‚Äì0 run under Coach Johnson, including SEC wins at home against South Carolina and Auburn, and an SEC road win at Ole Miss. Vanderbilt's fifth game, an October 4 match up against Auburn, was historic for the Commodores for many reasons. Aside from being Vanderbilt's first game as a ranked team in many years, it was ESPN College Gameday's first ever appearance in Nashville, and the 14‚Äì13 win gave Vanderbilt its first 5‚Äì0 start since the World War II-shortened 1943 season. Vanderbilt would go on to defeat Kentucky to get the sixth win and bowl eligibility for the first time since 1982. The Commodores lost to Tennessee and Wake Forest to finish the regular season 6‚Äì6. On December 10, Johnson was named Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year, along with Houston Nutt, of Ole Miss, and Nick Saban, of Alabama. On December 31, Vanderbilt defeated Boston College in the Music City Bowl to secure a winning season and their first bowl victory since 1955. Retirement On July 14, 2010, Johnson announced his retirement from coaching.Chris Low, , ESPN.com, July 14, 2010, Accessed July 14, 2010. Citing it as a \\"personal decision\\", the decision was a surprise to the program and the media as it occurred less than two months away from the 2010‚Äì11 season. In explaining his decision, he stated: \\"Football is not life, but it's a way of life and it consumes your life. You only have so many years to live, and you want to see a different way.\\" His tenure at Vanderbilt was lauded for bringing a resurgence to a team that had long been dominated by its fellow members of the SEC, notably guiding the Commodores their first bowl game win in 53 years and first non-losing season since 1982. On March 27, 2015, Johnson was added to the College Football Playoff selection committee, replacing Archie Manning.

Nicotine replacement therapy products (e.g. chewing gum, lozenges, transdermal systems) are indicated as temporary aids for the cigarette smoker who wants to give up smoking. They serve as alternative sources of nicotine and provide relief of nicotine withdrawal symptoms in nicotine-dependent individuals who are acutely withdrawing from cigarette smoking.http://www.pharmgkb.org/do/serve?objId=PA450626#tabview=tab1 NiQuitin is available as patches, gums and lozenges. History NiQuitin was approved by the FDA in 1991, touted as the original \\"nicotine transdermal system.\\" Created by GlaxoSmithKline, NiQuitin was the second product to provide an alternative to the withdrawal symptoms of quitting smoking. Nicotine gums were already quite popular with consumers.http://www.businessweek.com/1996/44/b3499161.htm Shortly after NiQuitin‚Äôs release, NiQuitin Clear was released, as some users complained about the patch's inability to match a wide variety of skin colors. Over the past several years, NiQuitin has become the most popular topical nicotine alternative. Also shortly after NiQuitin's release, many other pharmaceutical companies began releasing many nicotine replacement therapies including Nicotine gum, lozenges, inhalers and nasal sprays. The product is sold globally under different brand names such as Nicoderm in the US, Nicabate in Australia and New Zealand and NiQuitin CQ in China, many parts of Europe and South America. Criticism Nicotine is the addictive drug in tobacco products. According to the research consensus, many of the constituents of tobacco smoke are carcinogenic. Nicotine itself has not been shown to be carcinogenic, but it has been suggested that it may cause more favorable conditions for cancerous growth. The drawback to NRT products is that they don't cure an individual's addiction to nicotine, but simply substitute cigarettes with an alternative nicotine delivery vehicle. 'Willpower' is still required to eliminate a nicotine addiction. Generally it is argued that NRT products are safer than smoking tobacco because NRT does not contain Tar. Typically, the cost of NRT lasting seven days is between ¬£10 and ¬£20 depending upon the NRT product. In comparison, smoking can typically cost ¬£15 to ¬£56 for a smoker consuming 40-160 cigarettes per week. This is about ¬£7.50 for 25 grams of tax paid rolling tobacco. The cost of cigarettes or tobacco over the same period varies depending on the smoker and brand of cigarette, whilst the cost of NRT remains static regardless of the level of nicotine it contains because the varying delivery systems, nicotine quantity per use and brands of NRT are typically similar in cost. This leads to the relative cost of NRT versus cigarettes or tobacco being dependent on how much the individual smokes. The British NHS provides notable help in the form of prescriptions which reduces the cost to ¬£7.65 per script or less depending upon the individual's financial circumstance. If several products are included on one script then the price will drop well below that of actual cigarettes. Smoking is in essence an addiction to nicotine. NRT does not address this addiction it simply replaces one form of nicotine dosage with another, thus maintaining dependency on the drug. As a result, NRT companies are simply competing with tobacco companies for the nicotine market, rather than providing a way of eliminating a user's nicotine addiction.

Von Spiess was born in Austria and became a Romanian citizen after the Union of Transylvania with Romania, following the dissolution of Austria-Hungary. He was married to Auguste Herbert from Sibiu. Their daughter was the ornithologist Silvia Stein Spiess (1901‚Äì1993). In 1875, at 11 years old, he entered the military school of Sankt P√∂lten, after which he joined the Theresian Military Academy of Wiener Neustadt, Vienna. After 10 years of military studies, in August 1885 he became a lieutenant in the Transylvanian 64th Infantry stationed in the OrƒÉ≈ütie-Sebe≈ü-Alba Iulia area. In May 1889 he advanced to the rank of Major and settled in Sibiu, where he acted as drill officer. In 1893 he became a professor at the Military Infantry Cadet School of Sibiu; in 1911 he was named commander of the school. In February 1915, he advanced to the rank of Colonel and took command of the 2nd Regiment Infantry in Sibiu. Von Spiess finished his military career after the end of World War I, and was appointed by King Ferdinand I of Romania as Director of the Royal Hunts from 1 July 1921. He kept this function until 1939. Simultaneously, he was a member of the Commission for Protection of Nature and National Parks, alongside honorary memberships of many domestic and foreign societies and associations with similar interests.Von Spiess, after a Carpathian bear hunt. In 1926, Von Spiess and his daughter initiated a project to tag the birds of Snake Island, Romania. He led two hunting expeditions in equatorial Africa, in Kenya in 1936 and in Tanganyika in 1938. He was a fine observer of nature, a connoisseur of game habits and a keen hunter, and gathered during his life a collection of over 1,000 hunting trophies. He also wrote a number of books pertaining to animals and hunting, mostly tied to the Carpathian Mountains region. In 1963 his entire animal and arms collection was donated to the Brukenthal Museum in Sibiu. Later the collection became the August Von Spiess Hunting and Hunting Arms Museum and was expanded with similar collections. The museum is now hosted in a dedicated country villa.

Campbell, 538 U.S. 408 (2003), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that the due process clause usually limits punitive damage awards to less than ten times the size of the compensatory damages awarded and that punitive damage awards of four times the compensatory damage award is \\"close to the line of constitutional impropriety\\". The Court reached this conclusion applying guideposts first noted in BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996), requiring courts to consider: # the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct; # the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and # the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. Case historyBackground= In 1981, Curtis Campbell (who was insured by State Farm) caused an accident in which Todd Ospital was killed and Robert G. Slusher was left permanently disabled; both witnesses to the accident and investigators confirmed Campbell was at fault. Notwithstanding the evidence against Campbell, State Farm decided to contest liability and decline the settlement offers from both Slusher and Ospital's estate (both parties were offering to settle for $25,000 each, or $50,000 total, which was the policy limit). State Farm assured the Campbells that \\"their assets were safe, that they had no liability for the accident, that [State Farm] would represent their interests, and that they did not need to procure separate counsel.\\" However, a jury rendered a verdict that Campbell was 100 percent liable for the accident and awarded a judgment of $185,849. State Farm refused to pay the excess amount, nor would it post a supersedeas bond to allow Campbell to appeal the verdict;Counsel made the following statement to the Campbells, \\"You may want to put for sale signs on your property to get things moving.\\" Campbell obtained his own counsel to appeal the verdict. =Appeals on verdict against Campbell= While the appeal was pending, in late 1984 the Campbells reached a settlement with Slusher and Ospital's estate, whereby those parties agreed not to seek satisfaction of the judgment against the Campbells, and the Campbells would pursue an insurance bad faith action against State Farm. The attorneys for Slusher and Ospital's estate would represent the Campbells in the bad-faith suit and would make all major decisions regarding it. No settlement would take effect without the approval of Slusher and Ospital's estate, who would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm. In 1989 the Utah Supreme Court denied Campbell's appeal. State Farm then paid the entire amount of the judgment including the excess amount. Nevertheless, the Campbells filed suit against State Farm alleging bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. =Campbell's trial v. State Farm= Initially the trial court granted summary judgment for State Farm as it had paid the entire amount of the judgment, but the ruling was reversed on appeal. The Utah Supreme Court reinstated a $145 million punitive verdictCampbell v. State Farm Mutual Automotive Insurance Co., 2001 WL 1246676 (Utah 2001). against State Farm, noting that an earlier $100 million judgment had gone unreported to State Farm's corporate headquarters, and that the regional vice president had no plans to report the judgment under review, despite the judgment being substantially based on evidence of national corporate policy.Douglas Laycock, \\"Modern American Remedies: Cases and Materials\\", Aspen Publishers, Third Edition, pg. 737. Dissents Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas adhered to their previously expressed views that the Due Process Clause and Constitution provide no protection against \\"excessive\\" punitive damage awards. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg voted to leave intact the decision of the Utah Supreme Court. She expressed her view that the Supreme Court \\"has no warrant to reform state law governing awards of punitive damages.\\" Instead, Ginsburg wrote, while \\"damage-capping legislation may be altogether fitting and proper\\" (emphasis added), only \\"a legislative scheme or a state high court\\" is \\"authorized\\" to institute such a change in the law.

The field has also been referred to as \\"exercise genomics\\" or \\"exercisenomics.\\" Areas of study within kinesiogenomics include the role of gene sequence variation (i.e., alleles) in sport performance, identification of genes (and their different alleles) that contribute to the response and adaptation of the body's tissue systems (e.g., muscles, heart, metabolism, etc.) to various exercise-related stimuli, the use of genetic testing to predict sport performance or individualize exercise prescription, and gene doping, the potential for genetic therapy to be used to enhance sport performance. The field of kinesiogenomics is relatively new, though two books have outlined basic concepts. A regularly published review article entitled, \\"The human gene map for performance and health-related fitness phenotypes,\\" describes the genes that have been studied in relation to specific exercise- and fitness-related traits. The most recent (seventh) update was published in 2009.  Research  Within the field of kinesiogenomics, several research studies have been conducted in recent years. This increase in research has led to advancements of knowledge in associating how genes and gene sequencing effects a person's exercise habits and health. One study focusing on twins looked to see the effect of genes on exercise ability, the effects of exercise on mood, and the ability to lose weight. The research concluded that genetics had a significant impact of the likelihood an individual would participate in exercise. An increase in participation can be linked to personality factors such as self-motivation and self-discipline, while a lower participation in exercise can be influenced by factors such as anxiety and depression. These personality trait, both positive and negative, can be associated to one's genetic makeup.

He is also known for his illustrations of D. H. Lawrence's work, The Man Who Died,London Transport Museum and for the posters he designed for London County Council Tramways and London Transport. He was also a painter, lithographer, author and art tutor. Life Farleigh left school at 14 and enlisted as an apprentice at the Artists' Illustrators Agency in London, applying himself to lettering, wax engravings and black and white drawings, intended for advertising. He also attended drawing classes at the Bolt Court School. In 1918 he was drafted into the army and served until peace was declared in November of the same year. He resumed his apprenticeship and was awarded a government grant enabling him to enrol for three years at the London County Council Central School of Arts and Crafts (later the Central School of Art and Design). The teaching staff included Bernard Meninsky and Noel Rooke who trained him in wood-engraving. Between 1922 and 1925 Farleigh was an art teacher at Rugby School, thereafter returning to London and assuming a post at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, where he taught antique and still-life drawing and later, illustration.Archives Hub Here he tutored some extremely talented wood-engravers, including Monica Poole. In 1940 Farleigh was appointed as chairman of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society (now the Society of Designer Craftsmen). In 1946 the Society, in cooperation with the Red Rose Guild, the Senefelder Club, the Society of Wood-Engravers and the Society of Scribes and Illuminators, formed the Crafts Centre of Great Britain (now Contemporary Applied Arts). Farleigh was chairman of the centre from 1950 until 1964.Archives Hub In 1941 the British Council commissioned him to design the title page of the catalogue for the Exhibition of Modern British Crafts. The world-famous writer Judith Kerr said that he was the person who taught her most when she was doing evening classes at St Martin's School of Art during the war. (Judith Kerr's Creatures, 2013 Harper Collins p. 30) Farleigh's work was widely exhibited - Leicester Galleries, Manchester City Art Gallery, Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, Royal Scottish Academy and Cooling and Sons Gallery. His wood-engravings appeared in the 1925 Golden Cockerel Press edition of Selected Essays by The Reverend Jonathan Swift and in the books published by the Shakespeare Head Press in the late 1920s. He was elected an Associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers in 1937 and a full member in 1948.

Most of the dry spells during this period can be related to three El Ni√±o events in 1911, 1913 and 1914, though rainfall deficiencies actually began in northern Australia before the first of these El Ni√±os set in and did not ease in coastal districts of New South Wales until well after the last El Ni√±o had firmly dissipated and trends toward very heavy rainfall developed in other areas of the continent. The years before the drought had generally had satisfactory rainfall with impressive crop yields throughout most of the continent with the exception of the Gippsland region, the coastal districts of New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. In these areas, the rainfall deficiencies of the Federation Drought had never disappeared at any point during the decade of the 1900s. 1911 At the beginning of the year, a strong La Ni√±a event was producing heavy rain over eastern Australia. January was the wettest on record in Sydney, and February was a phenomenally wet month in Victoria and southwestern New South Wales, with places like Pooncarie on the lower Darling River recording for the month. Averaged over Victoria, February 1911 stands as the third-wettest month since 1885 after October 1975 and February 1973. Heavy monsoonal rain drenched Queensland throughout the summer. These months, however, were virtually rainless in the southwestern quarter of the continent and quite dry in the Kimberley and Top End. Early March saw exceptionally heavy rains in southern Victoria and eastern Tasmania: Melbourne's rainfall of remains a March record. However, in the Top End and Kimberley, drought was already established as Darwin had its driest March in 138 years of record with only as against an average of . April saw some good late wet season rains in the north due to a severe tropical cyclone drenching Port Douglas with a daily fall of and promising rains in southwestern Australia. However, despite the \\"big wet\\" continuing in southern Victoria through May and June, southwestern Australia and to lesser extent the settled parts of South Australia and southeast Queensland began to have major rainfall deficiencies in those months. By August dry conditions were, as is usual for El Ni√±o years, general except in coastal districts of New South Wales and the southeast of Western Australia. Southwestern Australia was particularly hard- hit: wheat crops failed completely in many places and led to a revolution in water supply and farming techniques to cope with rainfalls lower than previously known.Wadham, Sir Samuel; Wilson, R. Kent and Wood, Joyce; Land Utilization in Australia (third edition); p. 144; published 1957 by Melbourne University Press. In the humid forest belt, 1911 was the driest year of the twentieth century at Margaret River and Cape Leeuwin and even the Warren River, the most nearly perennial river in all of WA, ceased to flow during the ensuing summer. Apart from one big September fall in Victoria, dry and often hot conditions did not ease until one of the heaviest downpours ever known in Western Queensland fell in late November. This was followed by heavy general falls in December except in Queensland and northeastern New South Wales. November was the driest on record in many parts of western Victoria and eastern Queensland. 1912 The hopes the good December rains gave soon disappeared as January was exceptionally dry almost throughout the continent except for a few normally-dry areas between Perth and Geraldton. Major tropical cyclones provided respite to the Kimberley in February and the Eucla in March, whilst a small coastal belt of the Wet Tropics had exceptionally heavy rainfall in April and May, with Innisfail recording for those two months.Warren, Herbert Norman; Results of rainfall observations made in Queensland: supplementary volume: including rainfall tables, discussion of rainfall in districts and its relation to principal industries : also, temperature and humidity tables for certain selected stations and records of floods and cyclones; published 1940 by Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology However, elsewhere exceptionally dry conditions continued until a series of low pressure systems in June and July provided record-breaking rainfalls for that time of year in inland Queensland and New South Wales. Indeed, the winter averaged over those two states was nearly as wet as those of 1950 and 1998.NSW winter rainfallQueensland winter rainfall The wheat areas of Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria missed the heavy June falls completely but were very wet in July and the Western District of Victoria was relieved of anxiety by exceptionally heavy rainfall in the first eighteen days of September. Despite a dry October outside of southeastern Queensland rainfall for the rest of the year was generally satisfactory throughout southern Australia, though the wet season did not start well in the north. 1913 This year opened with some heavy monsoonal rains over the more coastal areas of Queensland and the Northern Territory in January; however, the month was very dry in the southeast apart from southern Tasmania. February was dry west of a line from Derby to Eucla and east from one between Melbourne and Bundaberg, but elsewhere some exceptionally heavy thunderstorm rains meant the month was a wet one. Adelaide received a particularly intense fall of on the 17th, with the worst flash flooding in the city's history. Apart from the North Coast of New South Wales, March was particularly wet, so much so that major flooding occurred in most rivers between Melbourne and Sydney. In Melbourne, the total of 23 rainy days is a record for any month between November and AprilMelbourne Highest to Lowest Rainfall and Raindays and the low sunshine hours of only four per day also unparalleled. The period around 12 April saw an extremely heavy if localised rainfall in the Albany district with totals of up to in a day near the Stirling Range and near Katanning. April was also very wet in the southern coastal districts of New South Wales, but May and June saw an unseasonal continuation of easterly winds. Thus, Tasmania, southwestern WA and the settled areas of South Australia were very dry, whilst most of New South Wales, Queensland and East Gippsland were wet. Apart from scattered coastal areas and the extreme southwest, July was exceptionally dry: Ouyen did not receive any rain in June or JulyGreen, H.J. and Watt, William Shand; Results of rainfall observations made in Victoria: supplementary volume: including all available annual rainfall totals from 1326 stations for years 1911‚Äì1936 inclusive, and monthly and yearly totals from 239 representative stations for the entire periods for which records are available up to the end of 1935; published 1937 by Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology and Adelaide's rainfall for the period of only was less than in the disastrous year of 1982. Frosts were exceptionally severe and led to fears of crop losses. The following three months saw an abrupt reversal, with dry conditions in Queensland and most of New South Wales contrasting with good rains in the Mallee, South Australia and southwestern WA. August was particularly noteworthy as the most completely rainless month known in Queensland and New South Wales. The rain turned an unpromising wheat season into one of the best on record despite a violent cold outbreak in the east early in November when Melbourne recorded its lowest-ever maximum for that month on Melbourne Cup Day of just . December saw very wet conditions in Queensland, with record flows in some Cape York Peninsula streams; but, apart from one rain event mid-month with another record daily total in Adelaide, dry weather prevailed elsewhere. 1914 January was very wet in the Top End, Kimberley and central Australia, but distinctly dry in the south of the continent, leading onto a major heatwave with exceptionally dry conditions in the far southeast during February, when Orbost received no rain and Hobart only . Torrential rains around Eden and Bega in March and wet conditions in southeastern Australia (especially Tasmania) in April were followed by a second heavy fall in a belt from Broome to the Darling Downs in May. The area around Uluru saw some of the heaviest rainfalls known until the 1970s that month. However, in the southern wheat belt May 1914 began a trend of powerful anticyclones and dry, easterly winds that was at the time quite unprecedented and not rivalled until 1982. In southwestern Australia the rainy season was extraordinarily poor from beginning to end, with only one significant fall all through from May to October and severe frosts prevalent throughout. June, August, September and October were all record dry months in VictoriaVictoria June rainfallVictoria August rainfallVictoria September rainfallVictoria October rainfall and Tasmania, and even unusually heavy July rainfall in Gippsland could do nothing to alleviate the drought. The result was, that with the northerly areas around the Darling Downs not well developed yet, Australia's wheat crop was almost completely lost after an exceptionally hot October in which temperatures reached over even in Hobart. Wheat yields in Victoria were only around 0.10 tonne per hectare and in WA even lower. In coastal districts of New South Wales, however, the extraordinarily powerful anticyclones that desiccated the interior produced powerful onshore winds and extremely heavy rain: in Port Macquarie, the spring was the wettest on record. November and December were notably hot and humid, with rainfall near or above normal except in Tasmania and coastal Queensland during November. The southeast of Western Australia was particularly wet during these months, but in the desiccated agricultural regions the rain was much too late to save crops or pastures. 1915 The heavy rainfall of November and December in Western Australia continued throughout the first two months of 1915, culminating in quite unseasonable downpours over the southwest at the end of February and beginning of March. During this period Perth had a spell of ten successive rainy days ‚Äì more than it normally has in February and March combined. El Ni√±o, however, remained powerful and eastern Australia was almost uniformly dry throughout the first three months of 1915 except for East Gippsland in January and Tasmania in March. Brisbane's March 1915 rainfall of is its lowest ever and only 2 percent of its long-term March mean, whilst even normally-soaked Cairns received only . April was equally dry in Queensland and the Northern Territory and only Tasmania and an area near Onslow was even remotely above average across the whole continent. In May, however, a trend of wet weather established itself across western Victoria, South Australia and southern Western Australia and continued right through to September. This wetness was backed up by the mildest winter across the southeast until global warming began in 1980. Crops that barely grew in 1914 grew with extraordinary vigour, and flooding even occurred in the Wimmera,Green and Watt; Results of rainfall observations made in Victoria; published 1937 by Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology around Adelaide and more severely in the Blackwood River of Western Australia. Although September saw unseasonable rain as far north as Mount Isa, the drought did not ease in Queensland, coastal New South Wales or Gippsland. Strong westerly winds and tinder-dry forests in August led to major bushfires breaking out in the North Coast of New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. Although occasional rain put many fires out in August and September, the dryness in these regions intensified greatly still in October and November due to extremely powerful westerly weather that saw New South Wales record its driest month of the twentieth century (statewide average rainfall ). Despite patchy rain in December 1915 was still the driest calendar year on record in most of the North Coast of New South Wales and the Atherton Tableland of Queensland. Notable low falls include: # Herberton with against a median of Climate data for Herberton # Lismore with against a median of Lismore climate data # Port Macquarie with against a median of Port Macquarie climate data # Inverell with against a median of Inverell climate data The year was, however, very wet in almost all of Western Australia, and also in western Tasmania and an area around Darwin, where December saw an extremely active monsoon with flooding. 1916 This year opened with heavy rain in Tasmania, southern Victoria and western Queensland, but the drought areas on the east coast did not gain relief until April. May, however was very dry except in a few coastal parts of New South Wales. This time, however, a powerful La Ni√±a developed and produced starting in June exceptionally heavy rain across almost all inland areas of the continent. Adelaide set a record monthly rainfall of in June and there was major flooding of the whole city, whilst in July record rainfalls occurred throughout southwestern Queensland. Still, it was not until nearly continent-wide heavy rains and flooding from late September to mid-December that the drought disappeared fully from the eastern coastal areas, especially Gippsland.

Scientists are still trying to understand the connection between caloric restriction and longevity.

Another of McCay's important contributions was the first work in heterochronic parabiosis: the joining of the circulatory systems of a young and an old animal, which leads to rejuvenating effects on the tissues of the old animal and degenerative changes in the young's, thus demonstrating the role of systemic factors in aging.

Two of McDonald‚Äôs projects are the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) and the Thesaurus Linguae Hiberniae. The TLG is a computerized compilation of Greek literature that McDonald founded and funded at the University of California, Irvine. Years later, she did the same thing in Ireland by founding the Thesaurus Linguae Hibernicae which computerizes Irish literature no matter what language they were actually written in. In her adult life, McDonald has reached an impressive number of achievements and has received numerous awards because of her works. McDonald has been awarded honorary doctorates from the National University of Ireland, University College Dublin, the American College of Greece, the University of Athens, and the University of Thessalonika. In 1994, she was inducted into the Royal Irish Academy - for her ongoing efforts to preserve and translate ancient Irish texts, being one of the few women to be inducted into the RIA. That same year, she was made a commander of the Order of the Phoenix, one of Greece‚Äôs highest awards, by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou for her contributions to Greek drama. In 1999, McDonald was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor for distinguished achievements as an American. McDonald has also been given Irish citizenship on the basis of all that she has done for Ireland. In 2008, she was inducted into the San Diego Women‚Äôs Hall of Fame. Her 2005 play \\"...and then he met a woodcutter\\" won the San Diego Critics Circle Craig Craig Noel Award for Outstanding New Play. As a pioneer in the field of modern versions of the classics: in films, plays, and opera, McDonald has published much work on the subjects. With about 250 publications, in addition to her articles and book chapters, her published books include: Euripides in Cinema: The Heart Made Visible (Centrum Press, 1983), Ancient Sun, Modern Light: Greek Drama on the Modern Stage (Columbia University Press, 1992); Sing Sorrow: Classics, History and Heroines in Opera (Greenwood, 2001); and The Living Art of Greek Tragedy (Indiana University Press, 2003); with J.

It pitted many Royalist military leaders against Republican troops under Jean-Baptiste Kl√©ber and Canclaux.  Course  15,000 men, detached as the Arm√©e de Mayence from the Arm√©e du Rhin after the fall of Mainz, were sent to reinforce Kl√©ber's force. On 18 September, Charette and the Arm√©e catholique et royale gathered again at Torfou, on the northern borders of Tiffauges. The following day, at 9 am, fire was exchanged for the first time. Kl√©ber launched one battalion to the right of Torfou and one to its left, attempting to encircle the town. The Vend√©ens under Charette coming towards them were discovered, fired on and forced into retreat. However, the women in the rear blocked the fleeing troops and convinced them to regroup and fight on the plateau where the Republicans were advancing. Fran√ßois Henri d'Elb√©e de La Sabloni√®re entered the line and Bonchamps tried to outflank the Republican left. Engulfed in Royalist troops, Kl√©ber advanced four cannons but was shot in the shoulder before realising his centre had collapsed.  Consequences  The Royalists decided to profit from the victory by pursuing the enemy and attacked Montaigu, where general Beysser was defeated. On 2 September, the Royalist leaders decided they must support Bonchamps and his attack on Kl√©ber. However, Charette and Lescure decided to march on Saint-Fulgent, where the Republican army had arrived. This disobedience had one immediate result ‚Äì on his return to Montaigu, Charette learned that Kl√©ber had escaped to Bonchamps. He grouped his army and returned to Leg√©.

Pauly & C. - Compagnia Venezia Murano is one of the most ancient glass factory of Murano: it was founded more than one hundred and forty years ago. This company produces glass art, most notably Roman murrine, mosaics and chandeliers. The company was formed in 1919 by a merger of Pauly & C (founded in 1902) and the Compagnia di Venezia e Murano (founded in 1866). It has since expanded in 1932 with the acquisition of MVM Cappellin & C. along with its drawings and back catalogues. In 1990, the company also acquired Toso Vetri d‚ÄôArte glassworks. The company maintains retail showrooms as well as exhibiting antiques. Two generations of famous master glassmakers were formed in the glass factory of Pauly & C. - Compagnia di Venezia e Murano. At a later time, they split off from it in order to establish their own ones and the main labels of Murano glass such as Barovier, Seguso, Toso. History: the OriginsCompagnia di Venezia e Murano= Compagnia di Venezia e Murano began as Salviati &C.; in London in 1866 under the direction of Vicenza attorney Antonio Salviati and with the backing of two British men: archaeologist Austen Henry Layard and antiquarian Sir William Drake. The company was dedicated to using ancient techniques and utilized master glassblowers in its efforts to do so. It called in specialists from other fields like goldsmithing and engraving to ensure authenticity and employed artist Giuseppe Devers to teach the techniques of enamelling and heat-applied glass gilding to company artisans. Archaeologist Layard was particularly interested in the mosaic glass techniques of Roman and pre-Roman artists, and he spent years personally overseeing the work of the company's technicians and glassblowers in attempting to revive those techniques. In 1872, the company was successful, managing to replicate the type of glass commonly known as \\"murrina\\" (plural, \\"murrine\\"). The company was renamed Venice and Murano Glass and Mosaic Company Limited in 1872, and, in 1877, Layard purchased Salviati's interest so that Salviati could pursue other interests. The company quickly earned a reputation for quality original glass art and reproductions as well as its many mural mosaics in Great Britain and elsewhere in Europe.Blake, 238, 241. In 1878, the murrine produced by Compagnia di Venezia e Murano was included in its exhibit at the International Exhibition in Paris, which was the chief attraction in Italian glass.Blake, 238. In its observations of the display, the United States Commission to the Paris exposition commented not only on \\"Roman murrhine glass\\", but also particularly on the mural glass mosaics, the \\"perfection of which\\" had \\"engaged the earnest attention of the company.\\"Blake, 241. Mosaics produced by the company during the time period are still in existence in diverse areas such as Gonville and Caius College Chapel in Cambridge; St Paul's Within the Walls in Rome, the Victoria and Albert Museum, Westminster Cathedral in London, Old South Church in Boston the Chamberlain Memorial in Birmingham, Palazzo Barbarigo and the Senate House rooms in the United States. The last specimen, a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, was produced and donated in 1866. Through the last years of the 19th century, Compagnia di Venezia e Murano took part in many other displays. Prior to the 1878 exhibition in Paris, it had shown at the Maritime Exhibition in Naples and the Trieste Exhibition in 1871 and at the International Exhibition in Vienna in 1873, where it won 13 prizes for decorative arts. It unveiled a new focus in 1881 with the display of the first of its glass phoenixes at the National Exhibition in Milan. It exported several thousand works for display at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, also setting up a kiln so that the public could observe the company's glass blowing techniques. In 1895, it exhibited at the first Venice Biennale (an event at which it would also feature later), with artisan Vincenzo Moretti taking prizes and artisan Attilio Spaccarelli earning special note for his engraving. 1900 saw a change in the company when its British owners sold their interest to a businessman from Venice named Tosolini, who was the owner of shops in St. Mark's Square. Under Tosoloni's ownership, the company stopped production in 1909, though it continued commercial distribution at St. Mark's Square. =Merger with Pauly & C= Ponte dei Consorzi, front entry of Palazzo Cappello Trevisan in Venice. Pauly & C was formed in 1903 by Emilio Pauly, Alessandro Hirscber Hellman, Vittorio Emanuele Toldo and Ernesto Graziadei, opening showrooms in Palazzo Trevisan Cappello, which would remain the headquarters of the company until its closure in 2007 for restoration. In 1919, Pauly & C. and Compagnia di Venezia e Murano were both purchased by the Milan Societ√† Anonima Sanitaria, which resold them the following year to Gaetano Ceschina of Milan. The newly merged company, retitled to its present name, continued display in its previous locations of St. Mark's Square and the Palazzo Trevisan Cappello. In 1925, the merged company resumed production of glassworks on Murano and began exhibiting again at the Monza Tirennale. =Post-merger growth and development= The company grew in 1933 with the acquisition of Maestri Vetrai Muranesi Cappellin, or MVM Cappellin, a glass company formed in 1925 by Paolo Venini and Giacomo Cappellin, which transferred to them rights to the works and designs of the MVM Cappellin artists such as Vittorio Zecchin and Carlo Scarpa. The company expanded into commissioned chandeliers, with notable pieces from the period being placed in such locations as the Palazzo del Quirinale in Rome; the Vatican Palace, and the Royal Palace in Copenhagen. More recently, interior lighting has been designed for such places as the Palazzo Bezzi in Ravenna and the Al Assawi family palace. In 1990, the company again expanded with the acquisition of Toso Vetri d‚ÄôArte glassworks. =The new century= Ceschina sold his interest in the company in 1963 to the Barbon family, who retained it until 1976, when they sold to Andrea Boscaro. Boscaro owned the company for almost 30 years before 2005. In December 2018, Pauly 1866, MVM Cappellin, e C.V.M. Compagnia Venezia Murano were acquired by the Venetian company iDOGI, which works in the field of the artistic glass for over half a century. Artistic associations The company has a long history of association with international artisans. In the period following the second World War, the company undertook long-term associations with master glassblowers Anzolo Fuga and Alfredo Barbini, engraver Francesco Andolfato and painter Enzo Scarpa. Shorter associations include sculptor Napoleone Martinuzzi in the 1960s, painter Libero Vitali in 1971, architect Franz Prati between 1996 and 1997, and fashion designer Romeo Gigli in 1997. In the later 1990s, the company also featured exclusive designs by Heinz Oestergaard, Maria Teresa Lorella Gnutti and Berit Johansson, whose association with the company persisted. Since the turn of the century, associations have included Venetian sculptor Livio de Marchi and Chinese artist Xiao Fan Ru. Museum display Glass art produced by Pauly & C. ‚Äì Compagnia Venezia Murano is on display in a number of museums. Among them: *The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, UK *The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, USA *The Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University, California *The Corning Museum of Glass in New York, USA *The Museo del Vetro, Murano, Venice, Italy Quotes \\"The human gestures around those elegant creatures of fire, breath and iron were extraordinarily agile and light, like the gestures of a silent dance.\\" In this passage of \\"Il fuoco\\", D'Annunzio writes about one of his trips to the Pauly & C.

Its 1896 building is amongst the oldest synagogues in continuous use west of the Mississippi River.The Jewish Travel Guide, By Betsy Sheldon, Hunter Publishing, Inc, 2001 The congregation is affiliated with the Union for Reform Judaism. History Boise's first Jews were present in the mining camps in the 1860s, but it was not until 1895 that a Congregation Beth Israel (Hebrew for House of Israel) was formed. Most of the congregants were from Germany and Central Europe and the synagogue followed Reformed ritual.Jewish Women Pioneering the Frontier Trail: A History in the American West, Jeanne E. Abrams, Published by NYU Press, 2006, p. 101ff. Moses Alexander, mayor of Boise and governor of Idaho, was an early leader of the congregation. The building was erected in 1896, and given a careful restoration in 1982.A Brief History of Congregation Ahavath Beth Israel Congregation Ahavath Israel (Hebrew for \\"Lovers of The House of Israel\\") was founded in 1912 by Orthodox immigrants from Eastern Europe. The congregation erected a building at the corner of 27th and Bannock Streets in 1947. The two congregations merged in 1986 to become Ahavath Beth Israel. A personal memoir/history of Congregation Ahavath Israel was written by one of its member leaders, the late Mr. Joel Stone; a copy of this book is obtainable through the congregation's lending library. A more comprehensive history of Ahavath Beth Israel (which focuses more on Beth Israel's history) was also privately published for limited release by a former member, and is likewise available through the congregation. Building Ahavath Beth Israel Synagogue The synagogue's wood- shingled 1896 building blends two architecture styles popular with turn-of- the-century Jewish congregations. The exterior is in mainly in the popular Rundbogenstil style, though the tall windows flanking the large, rose window are in the form of Horseshoe arches. This Moorish Revival detail continues on the inside, where the Barrel-vaulted ceiling is supported by horseshoe arches. The architect described the building as designed in a modern Moorish style.Synagogue Architecture in America: Faith, Spirit & Identity, Henry Stolzman, Tami Hausman, Daniel Stolzman, Images, 2004, p. 131 In 1972 the synagogue was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The carrier does not have to possess all the means of transport, and in practice usually does not; the carriage is often performed by sub-carriers (referred to in legal language as \\"actual carriers\\"). The carrier responsible for the entire carriage is referred to as a multimodal transport operator, or MTO. Article 1.1. of the United Nations Convention on International Multimodal Transport of Goods (Geneva, 24 May 1980) (which will only enter into force 12 months after 30 countries ratify; as of May 2019, only 6 countries have ratified the treaty) defines multimodal transport as follows: \\"'International multimodal transport' means the carriage of goods by at least two different modes of transport on the basis of a multimodal transport contract from a place in one country at which the goods are taken in charge by the multimodal transport operator to a place designated for delivery situated in a different country\\".United Nations Convention on International Multimodal Transport of Goods (Geneva, 24 May 1980)  Overview  In practice, freight forwarders have become important MTOs; they have moved away from their traditional role as agents for the sender, accepting a greater liability as carriers. Large sea carriers have also evolved into MTOs; they provide customers with so-called door-to-door service. The sea carrier offers transport from the sender's premises (usually located inland) to the receiver's premises (also usually situated inland), rather than offering traditional tackle-to-tackle or pier- to-pier service. MTOs not in the possession of a sea vessel (even though the transport includes a sea leg) are referred to as Non-Vessel Operating Carriers (NVOC) in common law countries (especially the United States). Multimodal transport developed in connection with the \\"container revolution\\" of the 1960s and 1970s; as of 2011, containerized transports are by far the most important multimodal consignments. However, it is important to remember that multimodal transport is not equivalent to container transport; multimodal transport is feasible without any form of container. The MTO works on behalf of the supplier; it assures the supplier (and the buyer) that their goods will be effectively managed and supplied.  Research  Influence of container on multimodalism Multimodal transport research is being conducted across a wide range of government, commercial and academic centers. The Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) within the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) chairs an inter-agency Research, Development and Technology (RD&T;) Planning Team. The University Transportation Center (UTC) program, which consists of more than 100 universities nationwide conducts multi-modal research and education programs.Testimony of Peter H. Appel RITA Administrator, U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation, November 19, 2009. The European Commission has invested heavily in multimodal research under the H2020 programmehttp://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2018-2020/main/h2020-wp1820-transport_en.pdf Horizon 2020 Work Programme: Smart, green and integrated transport (European Commission Decision C(2017)7124 of 27 October 2017). \\\\- examples are COREhttp://www.coreproject.eu/ - technologies for optimising and increasing resilience in multimodal supply chains. and SYNCHRO- NEThttps://www.mjc2.com/synchronet.htm - synchro-modal optimisation of supply chains..  Legal aspects  From a legal standpoint, multimodal transport creates several problems. Unimodal transports are currently governed by different, often-mandatory international conventions. These conventions stipulate different bases for liability, and different limitations of liability for the carrier. As of 2011, the solution to this problem has been the so-called network principle. According to the network principle, the different conventions coexist unchanged; the carrier‚Äôs liability is defined according to where the breach of contract has occurred (where the goods have been damaged during transport, for example). However, problems arise if the breach of contract is systemic (not localized).

Legislative history The act was a very controversial piece of legislation. The act was sponsored by Rep. Asbury F. Lever, a Democrat from South Carolina. President Wilson urged its passage as a wartime emergency measure. Some opposed the authority that would rest in the person of the \\"Food Administrator.\\" Others opposed language that empowered the president to limit or prohibit the use of agricultural products in the production of alcoholic beverages, thereby establishing a form of national prohibition. Senators proposed alternatives, including a prohibition on the production of whiskey alone for the duration of the war. Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge objected to the language that authorized the president to \\"use any agency or agencies, to accept the services of any person without compensation, to cooperate with any person or persons in relation to the processes, methods, activities of and for the production manufacture, procurement, storage, distribution, sale, marketing, pledging, financing, and consumption of necessaries which are declared to be affected with a public interest.\\"New York Times: \\"Lever Bill Before Senate,\\" June 17, 1917, accessed March 11, 2010 Wilson also had to fight off the proposal of Massachusetts Republican Senator John W. Weeks to establish instead a Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War.David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (NY: Oxford University Press, 2004), 123 Its official name was \\"An Act to Provide Further for the National Security and Defense by Encouraging the Production, Conserving the Supply, and Controlling the Distribution of Food Products and Fuel\\" and became law on August 10, 1917. It banned the production of \\"distilled spirits\\" from any produce that was used for food.David Pietrusza, 1920: The Year of Six Presidents (NY: Carroll & Graf, 2007), 159-60. Congress passed the Prohibition Amendment, which became the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, on August 1, 1917. In 1918, faced with complaints from farmers that the Food Administration created under the Act had set the minimum price of wheat too low, Congress passed an amendment increasing that level from $2.20 to $2.40 per bushel. The President's veto out of concerns about inflation and the impact on the British, is credited with producing disastrous results for Democrats in the 1918 elections in the states of the grain belt.David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (NY: Oxford University Press, 2004), 242-4 On August 18, 1919, after the end of hostilities, President Wilson asked Congress to extend the life of the Act to allow his administration to address widespread and dramatic increases in the prices of commodities. He requested amendments to include clothing and to set increased penalties for profiteering. Opponents delayed passage for months while berating the administration for its failure to control prices and then granted the authority the President requested in October. In the House of Representatives, the President's chief critic complained of the administration's priorities: \\"Where there is one man in a thousand who cares a rap about the League of Nations, there are nine hundred and ninety-nine who are vitally and distressingly concerned about the high cost of living.\\" The Department of Justice launched 179 prosecutions under the amended Act in the first two months following its passage.Stanley Coben, A. Mitchell Palmer: Politician (NY: Columbia University Press, 1963), 160-4 Implementation \\"Food will win the war\\" United States Food Administration poster The Act, an emergency wartime measure, was designed to expire at the end of World War I or shortly thereafter. It created two agencies, the Food Administration and the Fuel Administration. To head the Food Administration, the President named Herbert Hoover who had handled Belgian relief at the beginning of the war and had coordinating food and fuel supplies since May 1917 on Wilson's personal authority. As United States Food Administrator he had the authority to fix food prices, license distributors, coordinate purchases, oversee exports, act against hoarding and profiteering, and encourage farmers to grow more crops. He emphasized the needs of America's allies, both those under arms and the civilian populations, for American produce. He encouraged American households to consume less meat and bread. Wilson issued a proclamation in January 1918 calling upon Americans to demonstrate their patriotism by following Hoover's guidelines. There were voluntary \\"meatless Tuesdays\\" and \\"sweetless Saturdays.\\" Tuesdays and Saturdays were \\"porkless.\\" Both Mondays and Wednesday would be \\"wheatless.\\" Compliance was voluntary, though the baking industry, including hotels and restaurants, was limited to the production of war bread and rolls called \\"victory bread.\\" Initially it was made from at least 5% of grains other than wheat and that amount increased to 20% by February 24. His agency asked households to pledge their support and some 13 million of 18 million did so. Hoover's call for the conservation of the nation's produce emphasized voluntary compliance:New York Times: \\"Hoover Declares 'Victory Bread' and Cut Rations,\\" January 27, 1917, accessed March 11, 2010 Children were organized into the \\"United States School Garden Army.\\" When eating apples, Boy Scouts were urged to be \\"patriotic to the core.\\" Citizens were encouraged to grow \\"victory gardens\\" of vegetables in their backyards and vacant lots. Slogans like \\"By all means, save the beans\\" became popular. The Food Administration also fixed the price of a bushel of wheat, the price floor being $2 a bushel and the ceiling at $2.20. One of its posters said: \\"FOOD WILL WIN THE WAR; DON‚ÄôT WASTE IT.\\" By the end of 1918, about one-fourth of all American production was diverted to the war effort. January 1918 editorial cartoon by Oscar Cesare showing the U.S. Capitol boarded up and signs reading, \\"Closed; no fuel; all business conducted at White House.\\" The Fuel Administration under Harry Garfield, the President of Williams College, directed efforts to save coal. Nonessential factories were closed, and the Federal government had complete control over all aspects of the coal industry including production, pricing, sale, shipment, and distribution. Although the Act also included oil and natural gas, it gave the government less authority over those energy sources and no ability to control the price of oil and gas. Copying the methods of the Food Administration, citizens were encouraged to save fuel with \\"gasless Sundays,\\" \\"heatless Mondays,\\" and \\"lightless nights.\\" Garfield's most dramatic action was an attempt to speed fuel to eastern ports where ships were idled for lack of fuel. On January 17, 1918, he order the closing of all factories east of the Mississippi. That accomplished his goal, but exposed the Wilson administration to criticism both from its usual opponents and members of the President's own party.David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (NY: Oxford University Press, 2004), 124-5 On February 4, 1918, Garfield announced rules to govern the distribution of fuel oil that defined priority classes starting with railroads, then exports to the American armed forces, exports to America's allies in the war, hospitals, and several other classes.New York Times: \\"Fuel Oil Placed under License,\\" February 5, 1918, accessed March 11, 2010 Controversies In November 1919, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer sought and won an injunction against a strike in the coal industry under the Act. He claimed the President authorized the action, following a meeting with the severely ill President Wilson in the presence of his doctor.Coben, 178-9. On the President's role, see also Kenneth D. Ackerman, Young J. Edgar: Hoover, the Red Scare, and the Assault on Civil Liberties (NY: Carroll & Graf, 2007), 100 Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labor, protested that President and members of his Cabinet had provided assurances when the Act was passed that it would not be used to prevent strikes by labor unions. He provided detailed accounts of his negotiations with representatives of the administration, especially Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson. He also argued that the end of hostilities, even in the absence of a signed treaty, should have invalidated any attempts to enforce the Act's provisions.New York Times: \\"Gompers Repeats Injunction Charge,\\" November 23, 1919, accessed March 11, 2010 At one point Palmer asserted that the entire Cabinet had backed his request for an injunction. That infuriated Secretary of Labor Wilson who had opposed Palmer's plan and supported Gompers' view of the President's promises when the Act was under consideration. The rift between the Attorney General and the Secretary of Labor was never healed, which had consequences the next year when Palmer's attempts to deport radicals were frustrated by the Department of Labor.Josephus Daniels, The Wilson Era: Years of War and After, 1917-1923 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1946), 546-7 Palmer used the Act again in April 1919 against 38 of the leaders of a walkout by railroad workers.Coben, 185-6 The amended Act's attempt to limit profits was found unconstitutional in February 1920 by a federal court that found its language \\"vague, indefinite, and uncertain.\\"New York Times: \\"Amendment that Limits Profits is Declared Unconstitutional,\\" February 27, 1920, accessed March 11, 2010; Coben, 303n. The case was United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Company, 255 U.S. 81 (1921). The Supreme Court struck down the provisions of the Act that allowed the Food Administrator to set maximum prices and fine those who violated the levels he set in 1921. That same year, the Supreme Court upheld the Act's imposition of rent control in the District of Columbia, which had not been repealed along with the bulk of the Act.Melvin I. Urofsky, Louis D. Brandeis: A Life (NY: Pantheon Books, 2009), 851n Repeal The work of the Fuel Administration ended in May 1919. The activities of the Food Administration declined quickly after the Armistice of 11 November 1918 and all but disappeared by July 1920.Burl Noggle, Into the Twenties: The United States from Armistice to Normalcy (Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1974), 60-1 The Act of August 10, 1917, as amended, was repealed along with a number of other authorized-for-wartime measures in a joint resolution of Congress on March 3, 1921 by effectively declaring the wartime emergency still in effect at the time as formally over.Joint Resolution of March 3, 1921, c. 136, Public Res., No. 64., H.J.

Background Pushed back at Granville, the Vend√©ens hoped to reach the south of the Loire to which the path was open thanks to their victory in the Battle of Dol. On 23 November, the Vend√©en generals met at Antrain. The chief general Henri de La Rochejaquelein offered to march to Rennes where the republican army had sought refuge, in order to finish it off and free Brittany, the army could then attack Nantes to return to Vend√©e while meeting with Charette's army. On the other hand, Stofflet wanted to return by the shortest road, thus attacking Angers. Finally, Antoine-Philippe de La Tr√©moille wanted to attack Granville again, the town's garrison was reduced and the English seemed more willing to intervene there. This last plan was chosen by the officers, but the Vend√©en soldiers refused to obey and rather followed Stofflet's plan. The generals were forced to follow. The army thus marched to Angers. The Vend√©ens were no longer worried about the republican troops too busy reorganizing their forces, but they were ravaged by illnesses (dysentery, typhus and cholera) related to famine caused by their difficulties in supply and in protecting themselves from the cold of the upcoming winter. The battle Angers was defended by 4,000 republican soldiers commanded by generals Louis Michel Auguste Th√©venet and Jean-Pierre Boucret. The general Michel de Beaupuy, who was still recovering from wounds of the Battle of Entrames, was also present and wished to participate in the battle nonetheless. On 3 December the Vend√©ens attacked, but the initial assault wasn't better planned than at Granville, they spread into the faubourgs abandoned by the republicans but without siege weapons they were unable to pass the fortifications. All day long, the Vend√©en artillery of Gaspard de Bernard de Marigny bombarded the town gates with very limited success. On 4 December, the Vend√©en tried another attack, on the verge of taking the Cupif gate the republican troops led by general Jean Fortun√© Bo√ºin de Marigny arrived as reinforcements. These troops were the avant-garde of the Army of the West, their arrival provoked panic in Vend√©en lines who abandoned the siege and fled back to the North-East, towards Le Mans. Although victorious, the general Bo√ºin de Marigny was killed at the end of the battle, hit by a cannon ball. After the battle, following the orders of Marie Pierre Adrien Francastel, the decapitated heads of the Vend√©ens and Chouans killed during the fighting were exposed on the fortifications. Pitre-Chevalier also wrote that the sans-culottes, following orders of Levasseur \\"made a lustral procession, and burnt the frankincense of the fatherland to purify the walls from royalist contact\\".

A digital citizen is a person using information technology (IT) in order to engage in society, politics, and government. As defined by Karen Mossberger, one of the authors of Digital Citizenship: The Internet, Society, and Participation, digital citizens are \\"those who use the internet regularly and effectively.\\" They also have a comprehensive understanding of digital citizenship, which is the appropriate and responsible behavior when using technology. Since digital citizenship evaluates the quality of an individual's response to membership in a digital community, it often requires the participation of all community members, both visible and those who are less visible. A large part in being a responsible digital citizen encompasses digital literacy, etiquette, online safety, and an acknowledgement of private versus public information. People characterizing themselves as digital citizens often use IT extensively, creating blogs, using social networks, and participating in online journalism. Although digital citizenship begins when any child, teen, and/or adult signs up for an email address, posts pictures online, uses e-commerce to buy merchandise online, and/or participates in any electronic function that is B2B or B2C, the process of becoming a digital citizen goes beyond simple internet activity. According to Thomas Humphrey Marshall, a British sociologist known for his work on social citizenship, a primary framework of citizenship comprises three different traditions: liberalism, republicanism, and ascriptive hierarchy. Within this framework, the digital citizen needs to exist in order to promote equal economic opportunities and increase political participation. In this way, digital technology helps to lower the barriers to entry for participation as a citizen within a society. Holistically, digital citizenship covers both a social and political point of view, utilized at a local level in school and other educational systems while also being debated upon on a national level. There are many means of participating as a digital citizen to advocate for causes or specific issues that are controversial, and being a digital citizen encompasses a level of responsibility that includes universal goals that should be followed.  Types of digital participation  The development of digital citizen participation can be divided into two main stages, the first being through information dissemination.Restoring Trust in Government: The Potential of Digital Citizen Participation Within information dissemination, one subcategory includes static information dissemination, characterized largely by citizens who utilize read-only websites where they take control of data from credible sources in order to formulate judgments or facts. Many of these websites where credible information may be found are provided by the government. Another subcategory includes dynamic information dissemination, which is more interactive and involves citizens as well as public servants. Both questions and answers can be communicated, and citizens have the opportunity to engage in question-and-answer dialogues through two- way communication platforms The second stage of digital citizen participation is citizen deliberation, which evaluates what type of participation and role that they play when attempting to ignite some sort of policy change. For static citizen participants, citizens can play a role by engaging in online polls as well as through complaints and recommendations sent up, mainly toward the government who can create changes in policy decisions. Dynamic citizen participants can deliberate amongst others on their thoughts and recommendations in town hall meetings or various media sites. One of the primary advantages of participating in online debates through digital citizenship is that it incorporates social inclusion. In a report on civic engagement, citizen-powered democracy can be initiated either through information shared through the web, direct communication signals made by the state toward the public, and social media tactics from both private and public companies. In fact, it was found that the community-based nature of social media platforms allow individuals to feel more socially included and informed about political issues that peers have also been found to engage with, otherwise known as a \\"second-order effect.\\" Two types of opportunities rise as a result, the first being the ability to lower barriers that can make exchanges much easier. In addition, they have the chance to participate in transformative disruption, giving people who have a historically lower political engagement to mobilize in a much easier and convenient fashion. Nonetheless, there are several challenges that face the presence of digital technologies in political participation. Both current as well as potential challenges can create significant risks for democratic processes. Not only is digital technology still seen as relatively ambiguous, it was also seen to have \\"less inclusivity in democratic life.\\" Demographic groups differ considerably in the use of technology, and thus, one group could potentially be more represented than another as a result of digital participation. Another primary challenge consists in the ideology of a \\"filter bubble\\" effect. Alongside a tremendous spread of false information, internet users could reinforce existing prejudices and assist in polarizing disagreements in the public sphere. This can lead to misinformed voting and decisions based on exposure rather than on pure knowledge. A communication technology director, Van Dijk, stated, \\"Computerized information campaigns and mass public information systems have to be designed and supported in such a way that they help to narrow the gap between the 'information rich' and 'information poor' otherwise the spontaneous development of ICT will widen it.\\" Access and equivalent amounts of knowledge behind digital technology must be equivalent in order for a fair system to put into place. Hosted by the Government of France at the OECD Conference Centre in Paris, representatives discussed trust in data and how we can utilize data to spread openness in addressing environmental challenges. Alongside a lack of evidenced support for technology that can be proven to be safe for citizens, the OECD has identified five struggles for the online engagement of citizens: #Scale: To what extent can we allow every individual's voice to be heard, but also not be lost in the mass debate? This can be extremely challenging for the government, who may not effectively know how to listen and respond to each individual contribution. #Capacity: How can digital technology offer citizens with more information on public policy making? The opportunity for citizens to debate with one another is lacking for active citizenship. #Coherence: The government is yet to design a more holistic view of policy-making cycle and the use of design technology to better prepare information from citizens in each stage of the policy-making cycle. #Evaluation: There is a greater need now than ever before to figure out whether or not online engagement can help meet the citizen as well as the government's objectives. #Commitment: Is the government committed to analyze and use citizen's public input, and how can this process be validated more regularly?  Developed states and developing countries  Highly developed states possess the capacity to link their respective governments with digital sites. Such sites function in ways such as publicising recent legislation, current and future policy objectives; lending agency toward political candidates; and/or allowing citizens to voice themselves in a political way. Likewise, the emergence of these sites has been linked to increased voting advocacy. Lack of access to technology can be a serious obstacle in becoming a digital citizen, since many elementary procedures such as tax report filing, birth registration, and use of websites to support candidates in political campaigns (e-democracy) have become available solely via the internet. Furthermore, many cultural and commercial entities only publicize information on web pages. Non-digital citizens will not be able to retrieve this information, and this may lead to social isolation or economic stagnation. The gap between digital citizens and non-digital citizens is often referred as the digital divide. In developing countries, digital citizens are fewer. They consist of the people who use technology to overcome local obstacles including development issues, corruption, and even military conflict. Examples of such citizens include users of Ushahidi during the 2007 disputed Kenyan election and protesters in the Arab Spring movements who used media to document repression of protests. Currently, the digital divide is a subject of academic debate as access to the internet has increased in these developing countries, but the place in which it is accessed (work, home, public library, etc.) has a significant effect on how such access will be used, if even in a manner related to citizenry. Recent scholarship has correlated the desire to be technologically proficient with greater belief in computer access equity, and thus, digital citizenship (Shelley, et al.). On the other side of the divide, one example of a highly developed digital technology program in a wealthy state is the e-Residency of Estonia. This form of digital residency allows both citizens and non-citizens of the state to pursue business opportunities in a digital business environment. The application is simple; residents can fill out a form with their passport and photograph alongside the reason for applying. Following a successful application, the \\"e-residency\\" will allow them to register a company, sign documents, make online banking declarations, and file medical prescriptions online, though they will be tracked through financial footprints. The project plans to cover over 10 million e-residents by 2025 and there were over 54,000 participants from over 162 countries that have expressed an interest, contributing millions of dollars to the country's economy and assisting in access to any public service online. Other benefits include hassle-free administration, lower business costs, access to the European Union market, and a broad range of e-services. Though the programme is designed for entrepreneurs, Estonia hopes to value transparency and resourcefulness as a cause for other companies to implement similar policies domestically. Nonetheless, Estonia's e-Residency system has been subject to criticism. Many have pointed out that tax treaties within their own countries will play a major role in preventing this idea from spreading to more countries. Another risk is politically for governments to sustain \\"funding and legislative priorities across different coalitions of power.\\" Most importantly, the threat of cyberattacks may disrupt the seemingly optimal idea of having a platform for eIDs, as Estonia suffered its own massive cyberattack in 2007 by Russian hacktivists. Today, the protection of digital services and databases is essential to national security, and many countries are still hesitant to take the next step forward to promote a new system that will change the scale of politics with all its citizens.  Other forms of digital divide  Within developed countries, the digital divide, other than economic differences, is attributed to educational levels. A study conducted by the United States National Telecommunications and Information Administration determined that the gap in computer usage and internet access widened 7.8% and 25% between those with the most and least education, and it has been observed that those with college degrees or higher are 10 times more likely to have internet access at work when compared with those with only a high school education. A digital divide often extends along specific racial lines as well. The difference in computer usage grew by 39.2% between White and Black households and by 42.6% between White and Hispanic households only three years ago. Race can also affect the number of computers at school, and as expected, gaps between racial groups narrow at higher income levels while widening among households at lower economic levels. Racial disparities have been proven to exist irrespective of income, and in a cultural study to determine reasons for the divide other than income, in accordance to the Hispanic community, computers were seen as a luxury, not a need. Participants collectively stated that computer activities isolated individuals and took away valuable time from family activities. In the African-American community, it was observed that they historically have had negative encounters with technological innovations, and with Asian-Americans, education was emphasized, and thus, there was a larger number of people who embraced the rise in technological advances. An educational divide also takes place as a result of differences in the use of daily technology. In a report analyzed by the ACT Center for Equity in Learning, \\"85% of respondents reported having access to anywhere from two to five devices at home. The remaining one percent of respondents reported having access to no devices at home.\\" For the 14% of respondents with one device at home, many of them reported the need to share these devices with other household members, facing challenges that are often overlooked. The data all suggests that wealthier families have access to more devices. In addition, out of the respondents that only used one device at home, 24% of them lived in rural areas, and over half reported that this one device was a smartphone; this could make completing schoolwork assignments more difficult. The ACT recommended that underserved students need access to more devices and higher- quality networks, and educators should do their best to ensure that students can find as many electronic materials through their phones to not place a burden on family plans. Engagement of youth At the 2018 Institutional Convention, Shola Mos-Shogbamimu, founder of the convention, discusses the role of digital media in preventing the spread of sexual harassment and what measures can be taken to stop the spread of negativity in youth. A recent survey revealed that teenagers and young adults spend more time on the internet than watching TV. This has raised a number of concerns about how internet use could impact cognitive abilities. According to a study by Wartella et al., teens are concerned about how digital technologies may have an impact on their health. Digital youth can generally be viewed as the test market for the next generation's digital content and services. Sites such as Myspace and Facebook have come to the fore in sites where youth participate and engage with others on the internet. However, due to the lack of popularity of MySpace in particular, more young people are turning to websites such as Snapchat, Instagram, and YouTube. It was reported that teenagers spend up to nine hours a day online, with the vast majority of that time spent on social media websites from mobile devices, contributing to the ease of access and availability to young people. Vast amounts of money are spent annually to research the demographic by hiring psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists in order to discover habits, values and fields of interest. Particularly in the United States, \\"Social media use has become so pervasive in the lives of American teens that having a presence on a social network is almost synonymous with being online; 95% of all teens ages 12-17 are now online and 80% of those online teens are users of social media sites\\".\\"How American Teens Navigate the New World of 'digital Citizenship'\\". Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. Web. 23 Nov. 2011. However, movements such as these appear to benefit strictly those wishing to advocate for their business towards youth. The critical time when young people are developing their civic identities is between the ages 15‚Äì22. During this time they develop three attributes, civic literacy, civic skills and civic attachment, that constitute civic engagement later reflected in political actions of their adult lives. For youth to fully participate and realize their presence on the internet, a quality level of reading comprehension is required. \\"The average government web site, for example, requires an eleventh- grade level of reading comprehension, even though about half of the U.S. population reads at an eighth-grade level or lower\\". So despite the internet being a place irrespective of certain factors such as race, religion, and class, education plays a large part in a person's capacity to present themselves online in a formal manner conducive towards their citizenry. Concurrently, education also affects people's motivation to participate online. Students should be encouraged to utilize technology with responsibility and ethical digital citizenship promoted. Education on harmful viruses and other malware must be emphasized to protect resources. A student can be a successful digital citizen with the help of educators, parents, and school counselors. Limits on the use of data International OECD guidelines state that \\"personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be used, and to the extent necessary for those purposes should be accurate, complete, and kept up to date\\". Article 8 prevents subjects to certain exceptions. Meaning that certain things cannot be published online revealing race, ethnicity, religion, political stance, health, and sex life. in the United States, this is enforced generally by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)- but very generally. For example, the FTC brought an action against Microsoft for failing to properly protect customers' personal information.The Digital Person - Technology and Privacy in the Information Age - Chapter 1 In addition, many have described the United States as being in a cyberwar with Russia, and several Americans have credited Russia to their country's downfall in transparency and declining trust in the government. With several foreign users posting anonymous information through social media in order to gather a following, it is difficult to understand whom to target and what affiliation or root cause they may have of performing a particular action aimed to sway public opinion. The FTC does play a significant role in protecting the digital citizen. However, individuals' public records are increasingly useful to the government and highly sought after. This material can help the government detect a variety of crimes such as fraud, drug distribution rings, terrorist cells. it makes it easier to properly profile a suspected criminal and keep an eye on them. Although there are a variety of ways to gather information on an individual through credit card history, employment history, and more, the internet is becoming the most desirable information gatherer thanks to its fa√ßade of security and the amount of information that can be stored on the internet. Anonymity has proven to be very rare online as ISPs can keep track of an individual's activity online.The Digital Person - Technology and Privacy in the Information Age - Chapter 9 Furthermore, an open internet as delegated by a state's government is necessary to instill a sense of trust, legitimacy, and participation in the state's citizenry. WikiLeaks represents an occurrence where particular political actors have criticized and taken citizen action toward revealing the government's unnecessary clandestine activity online. As stated by the a representative from the World Heritage Encyclopedia, \\"The benefit of transparency isn't just catching red-handed bastards. It's also about collaborating and coming together with a more engaged citizenry,\\" and many critics have stated that the process in doing so will still take several years. Three principles of digital citizenship Digital citizenship is a term used to define the appropriate and responsible use of technology among users. Three principles were developed by Mark Ribble to teach digital users how to responsibly use technology to become a digital citizen: respect, educate, and protect. Each principle contains three of the nine elements of digital citizenship. # Respect: the elements of etiquette, access, and law are used to respect other digital users. # Educate: the elements of literacy, communication, and commerce are used to learn about the appropriate use of the digital world. # Protect: the elements of rights and responsibilities, security, and health and wellness are used to remain safe in the digital and non-digital world. Within these three core principles, there are nine elements to also be considered in regards to digital citizenship. According to digitalcitizenship.net, these nine theme include:Nine Themes of Digital Citizenship, digitalcitizenship.net #Digital access: This is perhaps one of the most fundamental blocks to being a digital citizen. However, due to socioeconomic status, location, and other disabilities, some individuals may not have digital access. Recently, schools have been becoming more connected with the internet, often offering computers, and other forms of access. This can be offered through kiosks, community centers, and open labs. This most often is associated with the digital divide and factors associated with such. Digital access is available in many remote countries via cyber caf√©s and small coffee shops.Digital Citizenship in Schools - Excerpt #Digital commerce: This is the ability for users to recognize that much of the economy is regulated online. It also deals with the understanding of the dangers and benefits of online buying, using credit cards online, and so forth. As with the advantages and legal activities- there is also dangerous activities such as illegal downloads, gambling, drug deals, pornography, plagiarism, and so forth. #Digital communication: This element deals with understanding the variety of online communication mediums such as email, instant messaging, Facebook messenger, the variety of apps, and so forth. There is a standard of etiquette associated with each medium. #Digital literacy: This deals with the understanding of how to use various digital devices. For example, how to properly search for something on a search engine versus a database. How to use various online logs. Oftentimes many educational institutions will help form an individual's digital literacy. #Digital etiquette: As discussed in the third element, digital communication, this is the expectation that various mediums require a variety of etiquette. Certain mediums demand more appropriate behavior and language than others. #Digital law: This is where enforcement occurs for illegal downloads, plagiarizing, hacking, creating viruses, sending spam, identity theft, cyberbullying, and so forth. #Digital rights and responsibilities: This is the set of rights digital citizens have such as privacy and free speech. #Digital health: Digital citizens must be aware of the physical stress placed on their bodies by internet usage. They must be aware to not become overly dependent on the internet causing problems such as eye strain, headaches, and stress. #Digital security: This simply means that citizens must take measures to be safe by practicing using secure passwords, virus protection, backing up data, and so forth.  Digital citizenship in education  According to Mike Ribble, an author who has worked on the topic of digital citizenship for more than a decade, digital access is the first element that is prevalent in today's educational curriculum. He cited a widening gap between the impoverished and the wealthy, as 41% of African Americans and Hispanics use computers in the home when compared to 77% of white students. Other crucial digital elements include digital commerce, digital communication, digital literacy, and digital etiquette. He also emphasized that educators must understand that technology is important for all students, not just those who already have access to it, in order to decrease the digital divide that currently exists. Furthermore, in research brought up by Common Sense Media, approximately six out of 10 US K-12 teachers used some type of digital citizenship curriculum, and seven out of ten taught some sort of competency skill utilizing digital citizenship. Many of the sections that these teachers focused in on included hate speech, cyberbullying, and digital drama. A problem with digital technology that still exists is that over 35% of students were observed to not possess the proper skills to critically evaluate information online, and these issues and statistics increased as the grade levels rose. Online videos such as those found on YouTube and Netflix have been used approximately by 60% of the K-12 teachers in classrooms, while educational tools such as Microsoft Office and Google G Suite have been used by around half of the teachers. Social media was used the least, at around 13% in comparison to other digital methods of education. When analyzing the social class differences between schools, it was found that Title I schools were more likely to utilize digital citizenship curricula than teachers in more affluent schools. In the past two years, there has been a major shift to move students from digital citizenship to digital leadership in order to make a greater impact on online interactions. Though digital citizens take a responsible approach to act ethically, digital leadership is a more proactive approach, encompassing the \\"use of internet and social media to improve the lives, well- being, and circumstances of others\\" as part of one's daily life. In February 2018, after the Valentine's Day shooting in Parkland, Florida, students became dynamic digital citizens, using social media and other web platforms to engage proactively on the issue and push back against cyberbullies and misinformation. Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School specifically rallied against gun violence, engaging in live tweeting, texting, videoing, and recording the attack as it happened, utilizing onside digital tools to not only witness what was happening at the time but to allow the world to witness it as well. This allowed the nation to see and react, and as a result, students built a webpage and logo for their new movement. They gave interviews to major media outlets and at rallies and protects and coordinated a nationwide march online on March 24 against elected officials at meetings and town halls. The idea of this shift in youth is to express empathy beyond one's self, and moving to seeing this self in the digital company of others. Nonetheless, several critics state that just as empathy can be spread to a vast number of individuals, hatred can be spread as well. Though the United Nations and groups have been establishing fronts against hate speech, there is no legal definition of hate speech used internationally, and more research needs to be done on its impact. Along with educational trends, there are overlapping goals of digital citizenship education, and they include:About Digital Citizenship Conversations, digcit.us #Digital footprint: An acknowledgment that posting and receiving information online can be tracked, customized, and marketed for users to click and follow. Not only the internet use but individuals' digital footprints can lead to both beneficial and negative outcomes, but the ability to manage one's digital footprints can be a sub-part of digital literacy. Digital footprints do not simply consist of the active participation of content production as well as sharing of ideas on different media sites, but they can also be generated by other internet users (both active and passive forms of digital participation). Examples of digital footprints includes liking, favoriting, following, or commenting on a certain online content creation, or other data can be found by searching through history, purchases, and searches. #Digital literacy: Almost twenty years ago, Gilster (1997) defined digital literacy as \\"the ability to understand and use information in multiple formats from a wide range of sources when it is presented via computers.\\" Digital literacy includes the locating and consumption of content online, the creation of content, and the way that this content is communicated amongst a group of people. #Information literacy: The American Library Association defines information literacy as the overall ability for an individual to target information that is valuable, being able to find it, evaluate it, and utilize it. This can be through information creation, research, scholarly conversations, or simply plugging in keywords into a search engine. #Copyright, intellectual property respect, attribution: By knowing who published sources and whether or not content creation is credible, users can be better educated as to what and what not to believe when engaging in digital participation. #Health and wellness: A healthy community allows for an interactive conversation to take place between educated citizens who are knowledgeable about their environment. #Empowering student voice, agency, advocacy: Utilizing nonprofits as well as government-affiliated organizations in order to empower students to speak up for policy changes that need to be made. Currently, more than 10 different mobile applications aim to allow students the opportunity to speak up and advocate for rights online. #Safety, security and privacy: Addressing freedoms extended to everyone in a digital world and the balance between the right to privacy and the safety hazards that go along with it. This area of digital citizenship includes the assistance of students to understand when they are provided the right opportunities, including the proper access to the internet and products that are sold online. It is on the part of educators to assist students in understanding that it is crucial to protect others online. #Character education and ethics: Knowing that ethically speaking, everyone will come with different viewpoints online and it is crucial to remain balanced and moral in online behavior. #Parenting: Emphasizing the efforts of educators, many want to continue preaching rules and policies addressing issues related to the online world. Cyberbullying, sexting, and other negative issues that are brought up are regulated by the School Resource Officers and other school counsel. Altogether, nine of these facets contribute to one another in the development of a healthy and effective education for digital technology and communication.

Republished in 2008, volume 2, pdf. It seeks both to explain and predict women's choices regarding investment in productive or reproductive work.Marshall, Gordon (2009), \\"Preference theory\\", in Description The theory sets out five socio-economic conditions which jointly create a new scenario: #The contraceptive revolution gives women reliable control over their own fertility for the first time in history. #The equal opportunities revolution gives women genuine access to all positions and occupations for the first time in history #The expansion of white-collar occupations, which are more attractive to women and men. #The creation of jobs for secondary earners, such as part-time jobs, working at home, teleworking, and annual hours contracts. #The increasing importance of attitudes and values in affluent modern societies, which gives everyone the freedom to choose their lifestyle. Preference theory posits that in the rare countries that have fully achieved the new scenario for women (she cites only Britain and the Netherlands), women have genuine choices as to how they resolve the conflict between paid jobs and a major investment in family life. These choices fall into three main groups: women who prioritise their careers and espouse achievement values (a work-centred lifestyle) and often remain childless by choice (about 20%); women who prioritise family life and sharing values (a home-centred lifestyle) and often have many children and little paid work (about 20%); and the majority of women who seek to combine paid jobs and family work in some way without giving absolute priority to either activity or the accompanying values (the adaptive lifestyle). Studies Catherine Hakim carried out two national surveys, in Britain and Spain, to test the theory, and showed that questions eliciting personal preferences can strongly predict women's employment decisions and fertility. In contrast, women's behaviour did not predict their attitudes, showing that lifestyle preferences are not post hoc rationalisations. This study also showed that other sex-role attitudes do not have the same impact on women's behaviour; notably, the patriarchal values measured by most social surveys, including the European Social Survey, have virtually no impact on women's personal choices and behaviour. Criticism Hakim‚Äôs preference theory has attracted great interest in the literature, but also considerable criticism. The main criticism is that it does not demonstrate causality, that the observed preferences causes changes in fertility patterns, and that it has been suggested that actual fertility may change values and preferences. It has also been suggested that the observed effect of lifestyle preferences on achieved fertility may absorbed by other factors when controlled for. Pdf of working paper version. A follow-up study \\"found that Hakim‚Äôs typology does not work well in the Czech Republic\\", that there were no important differences in fertility between the three groups in that country. A second follow-up study, surveying eleven European countries, found support for the theory in only two countries (Britain and Denmark).

Sponsored by Sen. Lee S. Overman, a Democrat from North Carolina, it gave President Woodrow Wilson sweeping powers to reorganize government agencies \\"during the continuance of the present war and for six months after the termination of the war by the proclamation of the treaty of peace, or at such earlier time as the President may designate.\\" (40 Stat. 556) With its authority, Wilson created the War Industries Board, the National War Labor Board, and the Committee on Public Information. War Industries Board (WIB) Established by the Council of National Defense under Wall Street broker and Democratic Party activist Bernard M. Baruch, it regulated much of the economy, setting production priorities for factories, and establishing centralized control over raw materials and prices. Mass production techniques were implemented in heavy industry to increase efficiency. The WIB required products to be standardized. It also conducted psychological testing to help people find suitable jobs. The WIB also dealt with labor-management disputes resulting from increased demand by freezing wages and forbidding strikes. With WIB direction, industrial output in the United States increased 20%. The downside, however, was soaring retail prices. Many large industrial firms resisted Baruch‚Äôs tight-armed tactics, especially U.S. Steel then headed by Elbert Gary. U.S. Steel made enormous wartime profits. Between 1915 and 1919, those profits equaled the wages received by the 2 million U.S. soldiers in France combined. Baruch threatened to take over U.S. Steel unless the company agreed to lower its prices. Gary sneeringly said that the government wasn‚Äôt capable of running the company. Baruch replied that he would get a 2nd Lieutenant to do the job. ‚ÄúBut that won‚Äôt trouble you very much,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIf those mill towns find out why we‚Äôve taken over, they‚Äôll present you with your mills -- brick by brick.‚Äù ‚Äì Gary agreed to lower the prices. At WIB suggestion, the Treasury Department sponsored the selling of Treasury Bonds, called the ‚ÄúLiberty Loan Drives.‚Äù Such drives were pushed for by the War Finance Corporation (WFC) under Eugene Meyer. Popular actors and actresses like Charlie Chaplin, ‚Äùthe little tramp,‚Äù Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, ‚ÄùAmerica‚Äôs Sweetheart,‚Äù and Sarah Bernhardt publicly campaigned for people to buy them. The campaign raised the then astronomical sum of $21 Billion. Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo even said of the bond drive: ‚ÄúEvery person who refuses to subscribe‚Ä¶is a friend of Germany and is not entitled to be an American citizen‚Äù and ‚ÄúA man who can‚Äôt lend his government $1.25 per week at a rate of 4% interest is not entitled to be an American citizen.‚Äù Another popular slogan was ‚ÄúLick a stamp, and Lick the Kaiser.‚Äù National War Labor Board (NWLB) Under former President William Howard Taft and Frank P. Walsh, it arbitrated disputes between labor and employers for the sake of the war effort and national unity. The slogan was ‚ÄúLabor will win the War.‚Äù Contrary to the phrase‚Äôs patriotic spirit, however, the War Department established the ‚Äúwork or fight‚Äù rule in 1918 which threatened any unemployed male with being immediately drafted. In response, union membership soared from 2.5 million in 1916 to more than 4 million people by 1919, with more than 6,000 strikes breaking out in wartime in protest against stagnant wages at a time of rising prices. Committee on Public Information (CPI) Under George Creel, it was the nation‚Äôs first propaganda agency. It made sure that all communication, either through art, newspapers, cartoons, or sculpture, did not exhibit anti- government tendencies or statements. Numerous silent propaganda movies were made, with such titles as ‚ÄúThe Kaiser,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Beast of Berlin,‚Äù ‚ÄúTo Hell With the Kaiser,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Claws of the Hun,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Prussian Cur.‚Äù The massive propaganda campaign included 75,000 ‚ÄúFour-Minute Men‚Äù who gave four-minute speeches to drum up enthusiasm for the war effort. The speeches were on such topics as ‚ÄúWhy We Are Fighting,‚Äù ‚ÄúMaintaining Morals and Morale,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Meaning of America.‚Äù By war‚Äôs end, 7.5 million speeches had been made to 314 million listeners‚ÄîCreel created the Division of Pictorial Publicity to spearhead official war propaganda art. He asked Charles Dana Gibson, the creator of the ‚ÄúGibson Girl‚Äù image and who was America's most popular illustrator, to assemble a group of artists to help design posters for the government. Famous illustrators such as James Montgomery Flagg, Joseph Pennell, Louis D. Fancher, and N.C. Wyeth were brought together to produce some of World War I's most lasting images. Flagg drew and painted the ‚ÄúUncle Sam‚Äù image saying ‚ÄúI Want You for the U.S. Army.‚Äù Seven million pamphlets entitled ‚ÄúHow the War Came To America‚Äù were distributed as well.

Design and development During the late 1950s and early 1960s several Australian companies made attempts to launch light aircraft production in Australia. Victa ‚Äì a company well known for the lawn mowers which featured prominently during the Sydney 2000 Olympic closing ceremony ‚Äì tooled up to produce their Airtourer and Fawcett Aviation designed and flew a single prototype of their high-wing Fawcett 120. Another development during this period was carried out by the Toowoomba Foundry, an agricultural equipment manufacturer based in Toowoomba, located west of Brisbane in southeastern Queensland. In 1957 Toowoomba Foundries set up a new division, Southern Cross Aviation Limited, with the intention of designing and constructing a new 4-place training and touring plane. Land was purchased by Southern Cross Aviation adjacent to Toowoomba airport, but due to council planning delays, design work was commenced in a section of Toowoomba Foundry's existing factory. An experienced designer, Newton Hodgekiss, joined the team, responsible for design and drafting of the new aircraft. Hodgekiss had worked at the UK firm Handley Page for seven years, during which he had been a member of the design team for the Victor B.1 bomber. Construction of the prototype commenced in mid 1959, and the SC1 rolled out for its first taxiing trials in February 1961. The first flight took place on March 1, 1961, with an \\"unofficial\\" circuit of the airfield. The \\"official\\" first flight took place the following day, with a total of 60 minutes in the air. A total of 25 hours of flight testing was undertaken - all in the hands of one pilot, R.J. Trousdell - before Southern Cross Aviation took the decision to cancel testing. This was due to the economic recession during the early 60s, as well as stiff competition from Cessna and Piper importers, which would have required SCAL to market the SC1 at a price level which doomed the economics of the project. The SC1 was found to perform very well in the air, its only vice being heavy aileron control. In later test flights the undercarriage was retracted (using a manual system), and the prototype was felt to be very pleasant to fly. In fact the undercarriage used on the SC1 outlasted it by many years, as the same trailing link rubber sprung units were installed on the Transavia PL-12 Airtruk agricultural aircraft. The prototype's good performance was partly due to its small frontal area, a feature which would have been sacrificed on production aircraft, as the cockpit was found to be too narrow for practical purposes and would need to be widened to gain useful elbow room. Powered by a 180 hp Lycoming O-360-AIA four cylinder engine, the SC1 cruised at 160 mph and had a range of 740 miles fully loaded. The fuselage was of all-metal construction, apart from the fibreglass engine cowling. The wing was also all-metal apart from fibreglass tip fairings, and featured fowler-type flaps on the inner sections and slotted NACA flaps on the outer sections. The outer wing sections were designed to be removable for storage, as well as being capable of carrying wing-tip tanks. The airframe was designed to handle engines up to 260 hp, and was fully stressed for aerobatics. Following the cancellation of flight testing, the prototype was placed in storage in Toowoomba, where it languished before being recovered by a group of enthusiasts from the Australian Aircraft Restoration Group (who run Moorabbin Aircraft Museum in Melbourne) in January 1970. The sole prototype was shipped to Melbourne (minus its engine and propeller) and was placed in outdoor storage. It suffered the ravages of weather and time until being dismantled and moved indoors, where it was stored for several years. Eventually it was shipped to the Museum of Australian Army Flying at Oakey, Queensland for restoration to its original state. During its short flying career, the SC1 remained unpainted apart from the engine cowling and wing tips. These were both moulded from fibreglass and painted white. The cowling was also painted black on top in front of the windscreen to reduce glare. A non-slip walkway was painted on the upper surface of the wing adjacent to the cockpit entry doors. The inside of the clear canopy glazing over the pilot's head was also painted white. The aircraft was never placed onto the Australian register, but it wore the radio callsign VH-SCA on the upper starboard wing, lower port wing and either side of the tail fin. At some point during its subsequent storage and later display at Moorabbin Aircraft Museum, the aircraft was painted white overall, with two different variations of orange and black trim. There may be two explanations for this coat of paint. On outdoor display at the museum, the airframe would need protection from the harsh Australian environment ‚Äì hence the coat of paint. Alternatively, there was a rumored attempt to interest Ansett Airlines in the SC1 as a basic trainer for their pilots. At that time, Ansett aircraft featured the same white, orange and black trim that appeared on the SC1. Aircraft on display The SC-1 is on display in the terminal at Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport just 16 km (9.7 mi) from the Toowoomba Foundry where it was built. The aircraft has once again been returned to its bare metal and white fiberglass appearance. Specifications (SC-1)See alsoReferences * Aviation Heritage Vol. 20 No. 4.

Quantin attained the rank of general de brigade in July 1796 and was promoted to general de division the next month. He retired in 1811 after service in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars.Six (1934). Dictionnaire biographique des g√©n√©raux at amiraux fran√ßais de la R√©volution et de l'Empire (1792-1814) Life Before the French Revolution he served in the naval artillery, abandoning it for the army artillery. In 1792 he was made captain of the canonniers of the 3rd bataillon du Calvados and rapidly rose through the ranks. In 1795 he had already become a g√©n√©ral de division and served under general Gabriel Marie Joseph d'H√©douville, chef d‚Äô√©tat-major g√©n√©ral of the arm√©e des c√¥tes de Brest, then under general Lazare Hoche in the War in the Vend√©e. His principles were shared with those two generals - to shed as little French blood as much as possible, to employ persuasion to reconcile hostile figures and to intimidate by examples of severity. General Quantin left the V√©nd√©e in 1797 to take up command of the 9th division at N√Æmes. A year later he passed to the 8th division and moved to Aix, the main town in the area. Most citizens abstained from attending the primaries and for some there was a disgust for assisting in these assemblies, which were always live discussions that degenerated into acts of violence, whereas others were indifferent or convinced these elections were useless as the executive could override them at will. General Quantin addressed the subject, in the name of the French Directory, in a proclamation instructing the province's inhabitants to come to all these assemblies and to contribute their votes. Even so, what was done at these meetings continued to seem pointless to the Directory and it annulled electoral operations that same year, despite the most scrupulous observation of its regulatory decisions. In year 10 (1801‚Äì02) he was called to join the Saint-Domingue expedition, commanded by general Charles Victor Emmanuel Leclerc, but returned to France in year 11 (1802‚Äì03) after Leclerc's death. He was given the cross of the L√©gion d'honneur in year 12 (1804) and was made a commander of the order on 14 June 1804.

It can be viewed as a polymer of tetrahydrofuran, or as the polyether derived from 1,4-butanediol. The product is commercially available as polymers of low average molecular weights, between 250 and 3000 daltons. In this form it is a white waxy solid that melts between 20 and 30 ¬∞C. The commercial product can be processed further into polymers with molecular weights of 40,000 and higher. The product is sold under various trade names including Terathane from Invista and PolyTHF from BASF. The BASF plant in Ludwigshafen at one point was producing 250,000 metric tons per year. Polytetrahyrofuran polyethylene glycol can be controlled for export from the U.S. under the Export Administration Regulations on the Commerce Control List and/or on export control regulations based on the Wassenaar Arrangement (ECCN: 1C111.b.5). Under these regulations export/transfer of the product may require a license or export authorization. Applications Terathane container owned by DuPont (before the business was sold to Invista). The main use of polytetrahydrofuran is to make elastic fibres such as spandex (elastane) for stretchable fabrics and for polyurethane resins. The latter are polyurethane prepolymers dissolved in solvent.Ashford's Dictionary of Industrial Chemicals, third edition, 2011, page 7587 They are used in the manufacture of artificial leather. These elastomers are either polyurethanes made by reacting PTMEG with diisocyanates, or polyesters made by reacting PTMEG with diacids or their derivatives. The polymer is also a starting material for thermoplastic polyurethane, thermoplastic polyesters, polyetheramide and cast polyurethane elastomers, used for instance in the wheels of roller skates and skateboards. Synthesis Polytetrahydrofuran is commonly prepared by acid-catalyzed polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. The starting material is natural gas, which is converted to acetylene, then reacted with formaldehyde to make butynediol and then butanediol. The latter is turned into tetrahydrofuran by action of a catalyst and then polymerized.

In effect, the bonds were loans from citizens to the US Government which would be repaid with interest in the future. There were two previous loan acts, The Liberty Loan Act and The Second Liberty Loan Act, each providing additional money to the US Government to fund the war. The Third Liberty Loan Act was enacted on April 5, 1918. The third act specifically allowed the US government to issue $3 billion worth of war bonds at a rate of 4.5% interest for up to 10 years with an individual aggregate limit of $45,000. The bonds produced by the Third Liberty Loan Act were not redeemable until September 15, 1928. The Third Liberty Loan Act was an amendment to the previous two Liberty Loan acts. The first Liberty Loan have been enacted on April 24, 1917, and issued $5 billion in bonds at a 3.5 percent interest rate. However, this loan was not sufficient to support the United States presence in the war. The second act was put into place on October 1, 1917, only a few months after the first. This time the loan allowed for an additional $3 billion in bonds at a 4 percent interest rate. The third loan was still insufficient and a fourth act was created on September 28, 1918, which allowed for an even higher amount - $6 billion at 4.25 percent interest rate. These bonds were sold primarily by the boy and girl scouts. The most famous of bonds poster depicted a boy scout handing a sword to Lady Liberty that is suited for battle. The scouts ended up selling 2,328,308 liberty bonds between 1917 and 1918. This totaled $354,859,262 that the government owed to the people of the United States and $43,043,698 allocated to the Allied forces. The expenses covered by these loans included weaponry, medical and surgical supplies, and vehicles. Though the liberty loans were to be used only to fund the war they are still used to this day to fund matters of extreme cost. The most recent use was in 2001 to offset the cost of rebuilding the areas affected by the terrorist attacks.

Tracy (October 3, 1833 - September 13, 1911) was an infantry soldier who received the Medal of Honor while serving in the Union Army during the American Civil War for two acts of bravery. Early life Tracy was born the son of Albert Tracy and Mrs. Harriet Birch Tracy on October 3, 1833 in Jewett City, Connecticut. After leaving school he learned the machinist trade. He married Mary Elisabeth Corbin in Upton, Massachusetts on December 27, 1853. Around 1853, the couple moved to Chicopee, Massachusetts where they made their home until 1890. Tracy worked in the cotton mills of the Dwight Company and the Ames Manufacturing Company during this period. Military career and associations In August, 1862 in Chicopee, Massachusetts, Mr. Tracy enlisted in Company A, 37th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry which was mustered into service at Pittsfield, Massachusetts on September 4, 1862. He was serving as a sergeant when he performed his first act of bravery on May 12, 1864 during the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House in Virginia. According to Sgt. Tracy: > At the 'Bloody Angle,' Spotsylvania, May 12th, our corps, the Sixth, > supported the Second in the famous charge against [Edward] Johnson's > Division of the Confederate Army. During the thickest of the fight, > Lieutenant Wellman was badly wounded, and I was ordered to take him to the > rear. It was about a mile to the hospital, and the shot and shell came so > thick and fast that it was extremely hazardous to venture across with a > wounded comrade, but I succeeded in carrying out the order, and after > placing the lieutenant in the hospital, I came safely back through the fire. > Upon reaching my company, Lieutenant Sparks congratulated me, saying: ' > Tracy, I hope you will not have to cross that field on a like errand again.' > Scarcely had he finished speaking, when a ball pierced his left breast and > he fell into my arms. We thought he was mortally wounded, but discovering > signs of life in him, decided to take him to the hospital, without waiting > for orders. His second act of bravery occurred on April 2, 1865 during the Third Battle of Petersburg, also in Virginia. Sgt. Tracy recounts: > At one o'clock on the morning of April 2, 1865, my regiment broke camp near > Petersburg, Va., and moved up to the enemy's front. Brigade pioneers and > sharpshooters were ordered to rush in advance of the brigade. The pioneers > were to remove all obstacles in front of the enemy's works, while the > sharpshooters covered the parapet. I was at that time detailed as sergeant > of the Third Brigade pioneers, and was second in command in the assault. The > part of the line we were expected to carry was made of enclosed works, > connected by breastworks of great strength with outer obstructions in the > form of two lines of chevaux de frise and two lines of abatis. It was > impossible to take the works while the enemy defended them, unless the > several lines of obstruction were first removed. As Lieutenant Shiver was > wounded early in the attack the command fell on me, and in directing the > removal of the first two lines of the obstructions I received a shot over my > ear and one in my left side ; and while removing the third line, a bullet > shattered my right knee-joint, costing me, subsequently, the loss of my leg. > Supporting myself on the abatis, I gave my orders to my men, and at last had > the satisfaction of seeing them carry away the obstruction, thus enabling > General Edwards to rout the enemy and cut the railroad and telegraph. The > flag of the Thirty-seventh Massachusetts was the first to wave over the > enemy's works. He was subsequently promoted to the rank of second lieutenant in recognition of his bravery. He was a charter member of the Otis Chapman Post 103 of the Grand Army of the Republic of Chicopee, of which he was adjutant in 1881 and commander during the three succeeding years. In 1884, he was a member of the Department Council of Administration; and, in 1891, he transferred his membership from the Chicopee Post to Abraham Lincoln Post 11 of Charlestown. He was also a member and former president of the Thirty-Seventh Massachusetts Regiment Association. Medal of Honor citation His Medal of Honor was awarded to him on November 19, 1897 with a citation that reads \\"At the risk of his own life, at Spotsylvania, 12 May 1864, assisted in carrying to a place of safety a wounded and helpless officer. On 2 April 1865, advanced with the pioneers, and, under heavy fire, assisted in removing 2 lines of chevaux-de- frise; was twice wounded but advanced to the third line, where he was again severely wounded, losing a leg.\\" Post-military life From 1888 to 1890 Tracy was employed at the United States arsenal in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1890, he moved to Boston, Massachusetts and was a night watchman at the Custom House Tower for sixteen years until the spring of 1906, when he was compelled by ill health to give up active life. During his employment at the Custom House Tower, he made his home in Charlestown, Massachusetts where he was well known and highly respected. Following the death of his wife on March 6, 1905, and his retirement from the custom house, he then moved to Somerville, Massachusetts in 1907, where he lived the rest of his life until his death in 1911. The final years of his life were spent as an invalid. He spent the final ten days of his life at home in critical condition before succumbing to the effects of a stroke on September 13, 1911.

Canada 1911-31 stamp issues  King George V stamp of 1912 Of the three countries that issued postage stamps portraying King George in his Admiral uniform, The Admirals, Canada by far, has issued the most examples, issuing several different series over a period of more than eighteen years.Lyman's Standard Catalogue of Canada-BNA Postage Stamps George V succeeded Edward VII as King of England and the British Dominions on 6 May 1910, however postage stamps bearing his image were not issued until late in 1911. The ensuing period, lasting until 1928, has become one of the most studied areas of Canadian philately which is somewhat unusual because only one basic stamp design was in use. There were several reasons for this, one of which was Canada's involvement in World War I from 1914 to 1918. This resulted in a scarcity of both engravers and the basic resources and materials needed to design and print postage stamps. Changes in currency exchange rates and international postal rates after World War One resulted in the Canadian Post Office issuing new denominations, as well as a change in the stamp's colors. The unusually long issuing period required new dies and several plates to be struck, resulting in a large range of flaws and other varieties for a stamp collector to study.The Admirals Issue Stamps, 1911-1925, by Hans Reiche Philatelists have also studied the Admirals in great depth due to the large numbers of varieties of the stamps. The Royal Philatelic Society London Marking the Diamond Jubilee of the Canadian Philatelic Society of Great Britain: The Admiral Issue 1911-26, Sandy Mackie, FCPS publisher=The Royal Philatelic Society London date=2006-04-27 accessdate=2010-08-24 On December 22, 1911, the first Canadian definitive stamps, the 1-cent and 2-cent denominations with a portrait of King George V, were issued and saw postal use for about 16 years, which was longer than any other definitives except for the Small Queens. The Admiral series is renowned for its multitude of re-entries and re-touches and like the Small Queen issue has the distinction of being one of the most extensively researched stamps issues by the Canadian government. ;First series, 1911‚Äì1931 The King George 'Admirals' issues, 1911-1931 The first series of the King George V definitive stamp issues depict the monarch in profile, facing the viewers left, and were issued from 1911 to 1931 with 11 different denominations ranging from 1-cent to 1-dollar. The engraving of King George is modeled after two photographs by H. Walter Barnettby and the other by W. & D. Downey. The engraving was mastered by Robert Savage of the American Bank Note Company whose main base of operation was in New York but which also had printing facilities in Ottawa, Canada. These issues are perforated 12 x 12. The 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 cent denominations were reprinted at later dates with different colors. Every denomination of the King George V issue were printed in panes of 200 and 400 stamps and cut into and issued in sheets of 100 stamps, or in booklet form with pages of 4 or 6 stamps. They were also released in coil form with three different perforation varieties and were first released in November, 1912. The last stamp issue of this series to be released was the 2-cent carmine issue which had the unusual perforations of 12 x 8 and was issued on June 24, 1931. ;War Tax stamp issues Canadian war tax stamps During World War I, Canada enacted the War Revenue Act of 1915. The Act created a 1¬¢ increase on all postage in the hopes that it would generate $8,000,000 Dollars to help with Canada's war costs. The War Tax stamp issues were released between April 15, 1915, and December 1916, the last issue being released in coil form. During World War I Canada was the first country to employ the use of War Tax designations on its postage stamp issuesCANADIAN PHILATELY ‚Äì AN OUTLINE (PDF), by John Burnett, Gray Scrimgeour, and Victor Willson, Published by the British North America Philatelic Society Ltd., 2008 and to this end the King George V postage issue, which was already in use at this time, was modified and printed with a War Tax designation, with two different engraved designations on the 1 and 2 cent issues. Like the regular Admiral issues, the war tax stamps were printed by the American Bank Note Company. ;1915 Overprints War tax overprints of 1915 Another type of War Tax stamp was issued with the a War Tax designation overprinted across the face of the stamp, in black or red ink. War Tax overprints were used in other capacities. War taxes were also placed on wine and spirits. To confirm the payment of this tax the Inland Revenue Department overprinted the blue 5¬¢ Admiral stamp with the inscription Inland Revenue WAR TAX, overprinted diagonally in black. The olive green 20¬¢ and the black 50¬¢ stamps were also printed with the same style overprint. The 50¬¢ KGV issue had the overprint in red. The creation of a war tax in April on medicine and perfume provided a use for all three denominations. The overprinted War Tax stamps were not issued to pay for postage but were meant to be used to pay the tax levied on money orders. However, because all the War Tax stamps did bear the inscription that read Postage they were showing up on mail in Post Offices across Canada. The problem with the overprints got so out of hand that the Canadian Post office terminated the use of the overprinted stamps on May 20, 1915. War Tax, The Admiral Stamps of Canada, by Tony Brown and Mike Burn / The Admiral Issue, 1911 - 1925, George C. Marler, Unitrade Press, Toronto, September 1980. Original work published in April 1949 by the American Philatelic Society. ;The '2 cents' overprints King George V Overprints of 1926 On July 1, 1926 Canada's drop letter rate that had been in use since 1915 was reduced from 3s to 2¬¢. At this time the Canadian Post Offices still had large quantities of the red King George V 3¬¢ denomination in their existing inventory. To make use of this stock, which consisted of some 140,000 sheets of 100 stamps, the issues were overprinted with a designation that read 2 cents. There exist two basic varieties of these overprints with the 2 cents designation printed with one line of type while the other designation was overprinted with the numeral '2' over the word 'cents'. Other overprint varieties occurred when the contract to overprint these issues was given to The Canadian Bank Note Company.BNA Philatelic Society Some overprint varieties produced are rare and valuable and as such there are faked overprints of those varieties in existence. ;Second Series 1928-1929 King George V stamp of 1928 The second series of the King George V Admirals stamps issued first started to appear in August 1928, as stocks of the first KGV 1915 issues were becoming exhausted. Rather than portraying the King in complete profile this series portrayed the King with his head at quarter turn, to the viewer's left. The series was issued in six denominations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 cents, with a different color for each denomination. The first stamp of this series to appear was the 4-cent issue, released August 16, 1928, while the 8 cent issue was the last of the series to appear, released on December 21, 1928. Stamps from this series that were also issued in coil form and include the 1, 2 and 5 cent denominations.  Rhodesia 1913-24 Issues  King George V stamp of 1926 ;The Admiral Issue 1913-22 Proofs and specimens exist. The ¬Ωd, 1d, 1¬Ωd and 2¬Ωd were printed from a single working plate and the remainder were bi-coloured and printed from double plates. Three engraved dies for the head were used which can be identified from the shading on the King's ear and the shank of the anchor on his cap badge. Shades for these issues are numerous. These stamp issues were perforated with gauge 14 or 15. Because of this numerous color varieties and other factors correct identification can be difficult the collector.Royal Philatelic Society of London Many books on the subject are out of print and difficult to obtain as is other source information. ;The Admirals of 1922-1924 The new issues were printed on white paper with clear gum. The texture of the paper is plainly evident and can be discerned easily. The 1923 issues however do not show the paper texture very clearly and the gum is smooth. The stamps were perforated 15 were never actually sent to Rhodesia, therefore genuinely postally used examples of these issues on mailed cover do not exist and any 'used' examples could only have been cancelled by request.  New Zealand 1926 Issues  King George V stamp of 1926 In July 1926, two shilling and three shilling stamps were issued surface printed with King George V in the uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet. Waterlow and Sons engraved the dies and Bradbury Wilkinson produced the printing plates. The first printing of the 2/- and 3/- values of this series was on thin Jones paper in 1926. The 2/- was in deep blue and the 3/- in mauve. The engraved impressions are generally rather poor. In May 1927, the 2/- was issued on a thick Cowan paper and the 3c was later issued in September 1927. The impressions on the Cowan paper are far better than those printed on the Jones. Initial printings of the 2c value on Cowan paper can easily be distinguished from the earlier Jones paper as they are a much lighter and brighter blue. The colour became deeper in later printings. In November 1926 a 1d stamp was issued with George V in his uniform of a Field Marshal. The Admiral Stamp was only issued in 1926 for New Zealand and contains only three definitive stamp designs. Combined with the Canada and Rhodesia Admirals this makes for both a more comprehensive topical and/or historical study group of stamps.

Design The MSC was designed by Major Hugh Alleyne ReevesRees, Cockleshell Canoes and developed at Aston House to attack ships anchored in harbours. The craft got its nickname \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" when Reeves was found sleeping in it by a passing officer. Cutaway image of Sleeping Beauty (Popular Science ‚Äì March 1947)Constructed of mild steel, the canoe is long with a beam of , used a 5 hp electric motor powered by four 6-volt batteries, had a top speed of , and could travel at a cruising speed of . Its maximum operating depth was . The Sleeping Beauty was designed to carry up to of explosives as well as being able to be dropped near its target by a heavy bomber. Fore and central trimming tanks within the hull can be flooded to sink the craft underwater or have compressed air blown in them to surface the craft. The pilot controlled the craft by a joystick that is connected to the rudder and hydroplanes, breathed through a Siebe Gorman Salvus MkII Amphibian rebreather or Dunlop Underwater Swimming Breathing Apparatus (UWSBA), and would have to come close to the surface to establish his whereabouts. The canoe can also be paddled or moved by raising the mast and setting a sail. Although the Sleeping Beauty was designed to accommodate only one pilot, sometimes a second frogman was carried lying on the bow. Different configurations were tried on the MSC such as the positioning of the hydroplanes; these were positioned aft, but sometimes moved forward during experimental work. The High Pressure air tanks (H.P.) could afford four blows to the surface from 40 ft and up to 20 blows to the surface from 15 ft.Rees, Cockleshell Canoes During the end of 1943 the MSC was referred to the \\"Assault Warfare Sub Committee\\" (AWSC) and had trials conducted at Queen Mary Reservoir. There the MSC was compared with the Chariot and Welman. The MSC was found to be small (up to 15 canoes could be carried in a larger submarine's torpedo storage compartment), light, easier to navigate, simple to operate, and quick to build. However, the craft was very difficult to control. Operation The MSC's usual method of operations was \\"porpoising\\" in quick rises to the surface to check bearings, then shallow diving. This manoeuvre required the pilot to put the bow of the Sleeping Beauty to the water's surface and watch the reflection of it underneath the surface, and just when the bow was about to meet with its reflected image the Sleeping Beauty would be put into a dive so that the pilot's head would come out of the water and he was able to see his direction. The pilot could leave the Sleeping Beauty to swim and plant limpet mines on enemy ships, rather than piloting the MSC to the target directly. Operational service SBs were also used for Operation Rimau, a raid on Japanese shipping in Singapore in September 1944 by commandos from the joint Australian, British and New Zealand Z Special Unit, sometimes known as \\"Z Force\\". After being found by a patrol boat, the Sleeping Beauties had to be scuttled along with the junk in which they were carried. Ten of the attacking force were taken prisoner by the Japanese and subsequently beheaded. A pair of Sleeping Beauties are believed to have been captured by German forces after an unsuccessful attack on enemy shipping in M√•l√∏y by members of the Norwegian Independent Company 1. The divers were landed with their SBs on the nearby island of Gangs√∏y. However, a local shepherd girl saw them and, thinking that they were thieving Germans, she reported them to the authorities. The divers were then chased across Norway by the Germans until they were picked up safely and taken back to their base in the Shetland Islands. In the summer of 1944, \\"Sleeping Beauty Number 72\\" was delivered to the United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of the CIA, and became the early prototype for today's Swimmer Delivery Vehicle.

HistoryEarly history= There is evidence of a number of ringforts in the immediate vicinity of the village, in the townlands of Carrickateane, Mullyaster, Tully North and Killydrum. According to the 9th-century Tripartite Life of St Patrick, when Saint Patrick was on his way to Magh Slecht to destroy Crom Cruaich, he founded a church and ordained a priest to look after it named Bruscus. The site of this Patrician church is thought to have been near Newtowngore. The ruin in the grounds of the present Church of Ireland church in Newtowngore is likely the medieval church of Moy, which was dedicated to Saint Patrick. Apart from this, nothing is known of the early ecclesiastical history of Carrigallen. There are two holy wells dedicated to the saint, one in Aughawillan and the second in Beaghmore. Nearby the latter is a wart stone where people used to make the cure of the warts by washing them in the water which lay in a hollow in the stone in Moy Abbey in 1345. =19th century= As of the mid-19th century, and as recorded in Samuel Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837), the parish was then made up of 1,500 statute acres, including a \\"great quantity of bog\\". At that time, the village contained about 100 houses and had a \\"market for grain and provisions on Monday\\" with fairs \\"held in April, 4 May, 9 August, 8 October, and the last Friday in December\\". Throughout at least the 19th and 20th centuries, a number of fair days were held at Newtowngore on- 25 February, 25 May, 26 June (or 28th), 25 August, 15 October, and 25 November. As of the mid-19th century, there was \\"penny post to Killeshandra and Ballinamore; and a constabulary police force [had] been stationed here\\". =Woodford Estate= Woodford (Estate) Collins ‚Äì Robert Collins was the lessor of several townlands in the parishes of Drumreilly and Oughteragh, baronies of Carrigallen and Mohill, at the time of Griffith's Valuation. (Estate) de Courcey ‚Äì The de Courcey family held land in the parish of Drumreilly, barony of Dromahaire in the mid-nineteenth century. The de Courcey family held land in the parish of Drumreilly, barony of Dromahaire in the mid- nineteenth century. (Estate) Palmer (Leitrim) ‚Äì The Palmer family were resident at Sriff or Shriff from at least the end of the eighteenth century. They held lands in the parishes of Drumlease and Drumreilly, barony of Dromahaire in the mid-nineteenth century. Henry Manly Palmer of Sriff was a member of the Grand Jury for Leitrim in 1851. Isabella Palmer of Drumkeel is recorded as owning over in Leitrim in 1876. Thomas Robert Palmer, living at Friarstown in the 1870s, owned over in County Leitrim at that time. This family intermarried with the Cullen family of County Leitrim on a number of occasions. Amenities Newtowngore has a Church of Ireland church (dedicated to Saint Patrick), a national (primary) school, a small number of shops and (as of early 2019) a post office.

Sunny, is treated to watch Payal in bikinis, in a very revealing dress soaping her car, in bubbles luxuriating in her bathtub and in other such enlightening poses. Soon, the two get introduced and Sunny gets the opportunity to rub her back and later, get her in the sack (later, Payal informs Sunny that they didn't have sex; he was just too drunk to remember anything. That way everyone's chastity is maintained). After having 'sex' with him Payal plays dead. A panicky Sunny goes to Rocky and tells him what happened. Rocky then goes to the lovely neighbour's house, wraps a dummy in a sheet and tells Sunny to bury it. He also deftly clicks some snaps of Sunny burying the 'body'. Soon Sunny gets a courier from a blackmailer threatening to expose him if he doesn't cough up Rs 10 million. Sunny has no option but to use his father's blank cheques. But somewhere down the line, Payal gets guilt pangs and tells Sunny the truth. The rest of the movie is then about Sunny and Payal who wants to do pashchatap and recovering the money from Rocky.

Guest reviewer for the BBC, Goher Iqbal Punn, also disliked the film and called it film avoidable fare and an ordinary piece of work. Nitika Desai of ApunkaChoice gave the film 2/5 stars and praised the story for balancing sexual exposure with comedy and thriller in the first and second halves respectively, but blamed the lack of substance in the story. It was however noted that those expecting to see lots of cleavages and bikini clad babes will not be disappointed. Kashif Ali of Full Hyderabad gave the film a rating of 1.0 and called it perverse suffering. Pankaj Shukla of Smashhits.com gave the film a negative review but praised Payal Rohatgi calling her a winner as both a sex bomb and an actress. Santabanta.com called the film - Eminently distasteful and not the least erotic or even titillating, 'Tauba Tauba' makes a mockery of the audience.

Developed in the 1880s, the feather trees became increasingly popular during the early part of the 20th century.John, J. A Christmas Compendium, (Google Books), Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, p. 129, (). The German feather trees eventually made their way to the United States where they became rather popular as well.Silverthorne, Elizabeth. Christmas in Texas, (Google Books), Texas A&M; University Press, 1994, p. 62, ().

Types of artificial treesFeathers= An example of an antique feather Christmas tree Feather Christmas trees, originally of German origin, became popular in the United States as well. Feather trees were initially made of green-dyed goose feathers which were attached to wire branches. These wire branches were then wrapped around a central dowel which acted as the trunk Feather Christmas trees ranged widely in size, from a small 2 inch tree to a large 98 inch tree sold in department stores during the 1920s. Often, the tree branches were tipped with artificial red berries which acted as candle holders. The branches were widely spaced to keep the candles from starting a fire, which allowed ample space for ornamentation. Other benefits touted for feather trees included the elimination of a trip to the tree lot and the lack of shed needles.Marling, Karal Ann. Merry Christmas!: Celebrating America's Greatest Holiday, (Google Books), Harvard University Press, 2000, pp. 58-62, (). In 1930 a British-based Addis Housewares Company created the first artificial Christmas tree made from brush bristles.Cole, Peter, et al. Christmas Trees: Fun and Festive Ideas, (Google Books), Chronicle Books, 2002, p. 23, (). The company used the same machinery that it used to manufacture toilet brushes. The trees were made from the same animal-hair bristles used in the brushes, save they were dyed green. For a time, the brush trees were immensely popular, with large numbers exported from Great Britain, where the trees also became popular. These brush trees offered advantages over the earlier feather trees. They could accept heavier ornamentation, and were not nearly as flammable. =Aluminum= An aluminium Christmas tree PVC Christmas tree decorated with fairy lights and baubles Aluminium Christmas trees are a type of artificial tree that are made largely from aluminium. The trees were manufactured in the United States, first in Chicago in 1958, and later in Manitowoc, Wisconsin where the majority of the trees were produced.Andrews, Candice Gaukel. Great Wisconsin Winter Weekends, (Google Books), Big Earth Publishing, 2006, p. 178, () Aluminum trees were manufactured into the 1970s,Fortin, Cassandra A. \\"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas (1958)\\", The Baltimore Sun, October 26, 2008, accessed December 14, 2008. and had their height of popularity from their inception until about 1965.\\"A dark family secret: the artificial Christmas tree\\", Oakland Tribune, December 24, 2006, via findarticles.com, accessed December 14, 2008.Pinto, Barbara. \\"Town Leads Aluminium Christmas Tree Revival\\", ABC News, December 18, 2005, accessed December 14, 2008.

PVC trees are fire-retardant but not fire- resistant. Many of these trees are made in China; from January to August 2005 $69 million worth of artificial trees from China entered the United States. The prelit tree has become increasingly popular in the United States and Germany as well, due to added ease of not having to string one's own lights. Types of lights popular today include incandescent lights (also referred to as \\"mini lights\\") and LED lights (where each bulb has its own socket, preventing the whole string from going out should one bulb burn out). Prelit trees are subject to the mandatory regulations for the safety standards of electrical products and have to meet safety standards approved by a nationally recognized testing laboratory such as UL (Underwriters Labs), CSA (Canadian Standards Association), ETL (Intertek), GS, BS and RoHS. Artificial Christmas trees may be \\"frosted\\" or \\"glittered\\" and designed for outdoor uses with UV additives.\\"Choices Abound for PVC Christmas Trees this Season \\", Vinyl News Service (The Vinyl Institute), December 3, 2008, accessed December 15, 2008. Plastic trees can come in a variety of different colors, and one type came with built-in speakers and an MP3 player. Companies such as Mountain King, Barcana and the National Tree Company have marketed increasingly realistic PVC trees made to closely resemble Douglas fir, Ponderosa pine or other common types of Christmas trees. During the 1990s trees not only began to appear more realistic but some also smelled more realistic. Many of these more modern models come with pre-strung lights and hinged branches which simply had to be snapped into position. More recently, companies such as Balsam Hill have begun to use (PE) plastic molded from natural tree branches in an effort to create more realistic artificial Christmas trees. However, not all makers of artificial Christmas trees strive for naturalism. Companies like Treetopia have received attention for marketing trees in non-traditional colors and styles, like rainbow-colored trees or upside-down trees. =Other= A stand- alone upside down Christmas tree Trends in artificial tree consumption have constantly evolved and a number of designer and other types of artificial Christmas trees have appeared on the market. Fiber optic trees come in two major varieties, one resembles a traditional Christmas tree.

Culture The tradition of putting up and decorating a Christmas tree is nothing new. It is the iconic symbol of the holiday and has become a focal point in the homes of those who participate in Christmas festivities. It is a ritual activity that many have fond memories of and there is a nostalgia to having a real tree. However, there was a change from classic to modern and this change occurred when numerous other artifacts became plasticized. The culture of Christmas intersects with the culture of plastic, and so the artificial Christmas tree is born. Its popularity has grown since its invention, creating a new demand. \\"Reports cite a 34 percent drop in live tree sales the past decade, and a 30 percent rise last year alone in the sale of fake trees, to 9.6 million\\".Langer, Gary.

The rise in popularity of artificial trees did not go unnoticed by the Christmas tree farming industry in the United States. In 2004, the U.S. Christmas tree industry hired the advertising agency Smith-Harroff to spearhead an ad campaign aimed at rejuvenating lagging sales of natural trees. A 1975 poll by Michigan State University showed the reasons why consumers were beginning to prefer artificial over natural Christmas trees. The reasons included safety, one-time purchasing, and environmental responsibility but the biggest reason respondents gave pollsters was no messy needle clean up. Production A typical 6 foot recycled PVC Christmas tree made by Oncor Most artificial Christmas trees are manufactured in the Pearl River Delta area in China. Between January and September 2011, over 79.7 million dollars worth of artificial Christmas trees were exported to the United States. The number of artificial Christmas trees imported to United States rose 139 million in the same nine-month period in 2012. Promoters of artificial trees highlight them as convenient, reusable, and of better quality than artificial trees of old. Supporters also note that some apartment buildings have banned natural trees because of fire concerns.Langer, Gary. \\"Poll: Fake Christmas Trees Grow Popular\\", ABC News, 23 December 2004, accessed March 29, 2009. There is also a robust market for artificial Christmas trees in Poland. An estimated 20 percent of all Christmas trees sold in Poland are artificial, and many are made domestically by individual families. One producer from Kozieg≈Ç√≥wki stated that every other house was an artificial tree producer. The trees are made from a special film which is imported mostly from China or Thailand. Entire families take part in production and the trees are sold throughout Poland with some being exported to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\\"Pining Fir the Holidays \\", Warsaw Voice, December 19, 2002, accessed March 29, 2009.

Most PVC materials for making artificial Christmas trees are now using tin as a stabilizer. PVC was used in some of the 2007 recalled Chinese toys. A 2004 study found that while in general artificial trees pose little health risk from lead contamination, there do exist \\"worst-case scenarios\\" where major health risks to young children are present.Maas, Richard P. et al.

The lead author of the 2004 study, Dr. Richard Maas, noted in 2005: \\"We found that if we leave one of these trees standing for a week, and we wipe under the tree we'll find large amounts of lead dust in many cases under the tree\\".\\"Lead Found in Holiday Decorations \\", WSBTV (Atlanta), November 29, 2005, accessed December 15, 2008. In 2007, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) asked the Consumer Products Safety Commission to investigate lead levels in Chinese imported artificial trees. Lead-free artificial Christmas trees do exist; for example, one U.S.-based company uses barium instead of lead as a stabilizer in its PVC trees.Lovley, Erika. \\"Lawmakers target fake Christmas trees\\", The Politico, December 13, 2007, accessed December 15, 2008.

Williams Creek is an important historical gold mining creek in the Cariboo goldfields of the Central Interior of British Columbia, entering the Willow River between Barkerville and the town of Wells, which is at the headwaters of the Willow River. Williams Creek is named for Wilhelm Dietz, a Prussian sailor who was one of a party that set out from Lightning Creek and was the first to discover gold on this creek, which was quickly staked by his companions and soon after by others. Williams Creek because the most important and richest digging in the Cariboo goldfields, giving birth to the towns of Richfield, Barkerville and Cameronton, which collectively were also known as Williams Creek. Barkerville and Camerontown were named for two of Dietz's companions, Billy Barker and John Cameron, Barker being the most famous and at times the richest of the Cariboo gold miners. Dietz's claim was not a money-maker and he died in poverty. Brief history of Williams Creek diggings The Cariboo gold camp has a storied history as a goldfield dating back to the late 1850s. It is estimated that placer gold in excess of 2 million ounces was captured in the area during the 19th Century. Total value of gold to date reported by 1877 for all claims on Williams Creek was $19,320,000.Mining Report, John Bowron, BC Government, 1877 (Gold Commissioner for Cariboo)], from British Columbia from the earliest times to the present.

Calcitriol (Vitamin D3) analogues have been proposed for use as antitumor agents. Studies on vitamin D3 have shown inhibition of cell proliferation in prostate cancer, but high doses of vitamin D3 result in hypercalcemia. The effects of vitamin D5 on prostate cancer have also been studied, and unlike vitamin D3, vitamin D5 does not cause hypercalcemia while inhibiting tumor cell proliferation. The most researched analogue of vitamin D5 as an antitumor agent is 1Œ±-Hydroxyvitamin D5.  1Œ±-Hydroxyvitamin D5  Background = The motive to develop 1Œ±-Hydroxyvitamin D5 stemmed from the tendency of calcitriol, or 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3, a natural metabolite produced in the kidney, to cause toxic hypercalcemia in patients when dosed at concentrations needed to interrupt prostate cancer cells' cycle and stimulate apoptosis. And while supplementation with dexamethasone decreases hypercalcemia, bypassing it with an equally effective tumor suppressant would reduce patient cost and stress. Thus, the therapeutic effects of 1Œ±-Hydroxyvitamin D5 as a potential antitumor agent without the side effects of calcitriol became a topic of study. 1Œ±-Hydroxyvitamin D5 synthesized first in 1997 by researchers in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago, under Robert M. Moriarty and Dragos Albinescu. By 2005, the group had revised its synthesis method for a more streamlined, higher yield-producing route. It involved the photochemical conversion of precursor 7-dehydrositosteryl acetate to contain a conjugated triene system, a hallmark of this analog, followed by hydroxylation, photoisomerization and deprotection steps.

After the war, Sporrenberg stood trial in Poland and was convicted in 1950 of war crimes and sentenced to death. He was executed in December 1952. Biography Jakob Sporrenberg was born on 16 September 1902 in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. Sporrenberg joined the NSDAP in 1925. In 1929 he was appointed an SA officer and one year later joined the SS, rising to the rank of SS-Brigadef√ºhrer by 1933. In January 1940, he was promoted to the rank of SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer (Generalleutnant). From 1941 to 1943, he was SS and Police Leader (SSPF) in Minsk. In 1943 he was assigned to the staff of General Erich von dem Bach to combat partisans. Sporrenberg subsequently succeeded Odilo Globoƒçnik as SS and Police Leader of Lublin, in the Generalgouvernement of occupied Poland in August 1943. In this capacity, Sporrenberg oversaw and implemented the mass shooting of Jews during Operation \\"Harvest Festival\\" In November 1944 Sporrenberg and several of his staff were redeployed to Norway. There Sporrenberg served as SS and Police Leader of S√ºd-Norwegen (South Norway). In May 1945, Sporrenberg and his staff were captured by British forces. Their interrogation shed much light on Globoƒçnik's activities in Lublin. One outcome of his interrogation was the transfer of Sporrenberg from the PWIS Detachment (Norway) in Oslo to the MI19 interrogation centre in Kensington Palace Gardens, London, known as the \\"London Cage\\"; for further questioning by the War Crimes Interrogation Unit. This established his participation in a number of war crimes committed in Poland and the Soviet Union. Post-war Sporrenberg was extradited to Poland in October 1946, and sentenced to death by a Polish court in Warsaw in 1950. The sentence was carried out on 6 December 1952 when he was executed by hanging. Sporrenberg has since been linked to the alleged German secret project Die Glocke (The Bell) by Polish writer Igor Witkowski, who claimed to have discovered the existence of Die Glocke from transcripts of an interrogation by Polish authorities of Sporrenberg. Witkowski claims to have gained access to read the transcripts through an unnamed contact in the Polish intelligence service. The interrogation and its contents have no primary documentation aside from Witkowski.

Luetgert Sausage & Packing Company. Luetgert, born in G√ºtersloh, Westphalia (now Germany), moved to Chicago in the 1870s. He married Louisa Bicknese on January 18, 1878, some months after his first wife died. They had four children together.Robert Loerzel, Alchemy of Bones: Chicago's Luetgert Murder Case of 1897, University of Illinois Press, 2007; \\"Alchemy of Bones\\" website: Adolph Luetgert, http://www.alchemyofbones.com/who/luetgertfamily/adolph.htm Luetgert had founded his own business, the successful A.L. Luetgert Sausage & Packing Company, and was considered the \\"sausage king\\" of Chicago. Prosecuted by State's Attorney Charles S. Deneen, later a two-term governor of Illinois, Luetgert was convicted and sentenced to life in prison on February 9, 1898. He died in prison a year and a half later. After the trial was publicized, rumors spread that Luetgert had ground up his wife's remains as sausage and sold this \\"sausage\\" to unknowing consumers. Sales of sausage in Chicago dropped off for a while. The tale was later proved false, as her body was shown to have been dissolved and the remains mostly burned, but the legend persists to this day. Another common legend related to the murder is that the ghost of Louisa Luetgert haunts the old factory grounds and the couple's former home in Chicago.  Early life  Adolph Louis Luetgert, born on December 27, 1845, was originally named Adolph Ludwig L√ºtgert. He was born in a town called G√ºtersloh, located in the province of Westphalia, which is now a part of Germany. His parents, Christian Heinrich L√ºtgert and Margreta Sophia Severin, had a total of sixteen children; twelve other sons and two daughters. Adolph was the fourth born in the family. He had a twin brother named Heinrich Friedrich \\"Fritz\\" Luetgert, who died in 1894 or 1895. While Adolph Luetgert and his twin were growing up, their father dealt with animal hides and tallow wool, as well a dabbling in real estate. Luetgert's schooling lasted from about the age of seven until the age of fourteen, as was typical of the time for tradesmen's sons. He worked as an apprentice under Ferdinand Knabel, who taught him about the tanning business. During his apprenticeship, Luetgert continued to live in Westphalia, and lived with his boss instead of his family. After working for Knabel for two and a half years, Luetgert began to travel around Germany, working wherever he could. At the age of nineteen, Luetgert traveled to London, England, where he stayed for about six months. He left because he was unable to find a job other than scrubbing restaurant floors.Loerzel, Alchemy of Bones: \\"Luetgert Tells His Life Story\\", http://www.alchemyofbones.com/stories/lifestory.htm  Life in America  Luetgert immigrated to New York City around 1865 or 1866, when he was about twenty years old. He had heard that thousands of his countrymen were going to America with very little money but were able to find work. With about thirty dollars to his name, Luetgert boarded a ship bound for the United States. After a short time in New York, Luetgert traveled to Quincy, Illinois, to join some friends of his eldest brother Henry, who were living there. He stayed in Quincy for about four months before moving to Chicago in search of a job at a tannery, which he found at Union Hide and Leather Company. Luetgert did not have a steady job or constant pay at the tannery, so he began also to take on random jobs such as working as a moving man. From 1867 to 1868, Luetgert worked at another tannery called Engle, Crossley & Co. He next worked at a tannery called Craig, Clark & Company, but returned to the Engle tannery, working there until 1872. He had saved four thousand dollars and started his own business, initially dealing in liquor before starting his eponymous sausage company in 1879. Luetgert married his first wife, Caroline Roepke, on April 13, 1872, in Germany; their first son Arnold was born there in 1875. They later also had a second child. Caroline died on November 17, 1877, after joining her husband in the US. He married his second wife Louisa Bicknese, two months after Caroline's death, on January 18, 1878. Luetgert fathered a total of six children‚Äîtwo with Caroline and four with Louisa. Only three of these children survived past the age of 2.  Murder and police investigation  Louisa Luetgert was reported as missing on May 1, 1897. Adolph Luetgert told their children that their mother had gone to visit her sister on the previous night but never came back. After a few days, Louisa's brother, Diedrich Bicknese, went to the police to report her disappearance. Luetgert told the police that she ran away with another man.Clyde Collins Snow, \\"Forensic Anthrolopology\\", Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 11 (1982), pp. 97-131, via JSTOR https://www.jstor.org/stable/2155777. During their investigation, the police learned that the couple had a history of domestic violence and that they fought on a regular basis. According to a source, Luetgert had financial difficulties during the Panic of 1896. He had started courting a rich widow whom he planned to marry once he got rid of his wife. The police discovered that on the night of May 1, 1897, the night Louisa disappeared, she was seen entering the sausage factory with her husband at 10:30pm. A watchman from the factory confirmed the account, saying that Luetgert gave him an errand to run and told him that he could take the rest of the night off. The police also came across bills that documented Luetgert having bought arsenic and potash the day before the murder. Due to all the accumulated evidence, they were convinced that Luetgert had killed his wife, boiled her in lye, and disposed of her remains by burning them in the factory furnace. The officers started searching in the furnace, where they found burned foul sausages and human remains. They also found two of Louisa's rings, including one that had the initials \\"LL\\" engraved on it. Bone fragments identified by a forensic anthropologist included metatarsal bones, toe phalanx, ribs, and the head of a human female. Due to the overwhelming evidence, Luetgert, still claiming his innocence, was arrested and tried.  Trials  Luetgert's first murder trial began in August 1897 and took place in the Cook County courthouse with Judge Richard Tuthill presiding. Luetgert was defended by William Vincent and prosecuted by State's Attorney Charles S. Deneen. The latter was later elected as governor of Illinois for two terms, and as US Senator for Illinois. The prosecution presented bone fragments and the ring inscribed \\"LL\\", recovered from one of the grinders in Luetgert's sausage factory, as its main evidence that Louisa had been killed there. The defense argued that Louisa Luetgert had left her house freely on May 1, 1897, citing many claims of people around the US who said that they had seen her after the trial began. During the trial, observers thought that Luetgert seemed unconcerned and overly confident that he would be found innocent. The jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, resulting in a hung jury. The case was retried in January 1898 at the same courthouse. The prosecution used George Amos Dorsey, an anthropologist from the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago, as an expert witness to prove that the bones found were human. This time, the jury came to a unanimous verdict that Luetgert was guilty. Luetgert was convicted and sentenced to life in prison on February 9, 1898. Eighteen months later, on July 7, 1899,Loerzel, Alchemy of Bones, \\"Debunking Myths on Luetgert Case\\", http://www.alchemyofbones.com/myths.htm. Luetgert was found dead in his cell at the Illinois State Penitentiary. The official cause of death was \\"fatty degenerative heart disease\\". This case was one of the first trials to be widely covered by the media. Newspapers from Chicago reported on it daily, and some of the reporters tried to eavesdrop on the jury deliberations. It is credited with making murder trials a subject of general interest in the media. This case also was one of the earliest to use an anthropologist as a forensic expert in a trial.Elizabeth Royte, \\"Let the Bones Talk is the Watchword for Scientist-Sleuth,\\" Smithsonian Magazine, May 1996, vol. 27, 2, p. 82  Myths about Mrs. Luetgert  There were many \\"sightings\\" of Louisa Luetgert after the trial began. She was sighted in twelve different states but never found. One of the most famous myths was that she was seen boarding a ship in New York bound for Europe. When Adolph Luetgert heard this, he said that he thought she was definitely fleeing the country. Louisa, however, was never reported as seen outside the United States.  The factory  Some claim that the Luetgert factory burned to the ground in 1902. Robert Loerzel documented that the factory still stands, although a fire took place there on June 26, 1904. Today, the factory stands on the south side of the 1700 block of West Diversey Parkway. It has been converted into residential condominiums.

The organisation is an independently registered charity affiliated to the national charity Headway UK. The charity works to help its clients and their families adjust to physical and psychological changes following brain injuries. Headway Devon provides social rehabilitation opportunities at seven centres in locations across Devon. The charity also employs a team of Outreach workers who visit clients in their own homes and communities. Centre-based rehabilitation The charity's approach to centre-based brain injury rehabilitation is to provide a safe, relaxed, pressure-free environment with therapeutic activities, workshops and/groups, and social contact for people recovering from a brain injury. Days at the centre are also a source of respite for full-time carers. Before attendance at a centre, an assessment is made and a care plan agreed, enabling staff to work towards mutual rehabilitation objectives. Centre attendance can help to renew meaningful daily activity, as well as offering an opportunity for social contact for those who have become isolated. Headway Devon centres are located in Exeter, Exmouth, Honiton, Tiverton, Torquay and Okehampton. The charity also runs a children's centre in Exeter on Saturdays. Outreach support Outreach support is a community-based service, with trained specialist staff working one-to-one with individuals in their homes and communities. The aim of outreach is to maximise independent living skills and to facilitate social inclusion. This is typically achieved by providing help with housing issues, assisted shopping, budgeting, advocacy, counselling, and contact with outside agencies. Outreach can include any or all of these plus a wide variety of activities and tasks to help facilitate the rehabilitation process. When possible and appropriate, this includes a return to employment - paid or voluntary. Each outreach programme is agreed with the individual and designed to meet their needs. Headway Devon is managed by a Board of Trustees,http://www.charity- commission.gov.uk/ShowCharity/RegisterOfCharities/ContactAndTrustees.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1097870&SubsidiaryNumber;=0 which includes a number of client representatives. According to accounts published by the Charity Commission, the charity's income for the year to March 2008 was ¬£578,727. This was raised through a mixture of grants from local social services, payments for services provided, and fundraising.

In 1905 she and her sister, Irene Lewisohn, began classes and club work at the Henry Street Settlement House in New York. They produced performances with both dance and drama. In 1915, they opened the Neighborhood Playhouse on the corner of Grand and Pitt Streets. There they offered training in both dance and drama to children and teenagers. Irene was in charge of the dance training and production, with the assistance of Blanche Talmud. Alice Lewisohn was in charge of the dramatic arts. In 1924 she married artist, cartoonist and designer Herbert E. Crowley. She resided in Zurich, Switzerland for many years and was part of the Carl Jung inner circle, along with Crowley. The notion of a hermaphroditic God, drawn from Kabballah, was suggested to Jung by Alice Lewisohn, and commented on by Jung in a dream analysis seminar. Jung urged Alice Lewisohn to flee Europe at the onset of World War II in a letter in which he suggested that suicide would be a better option than for her to be \\"sent to Poland.\\" In 1927 Lewisohn closed the Neighborhood Playhouse after a dozen years of success, including landmark productions such as 1925's The Dybbuk. After the Second World War, Lewisohn settled in Zurich with her husband. She died in Zurich 1972 as Alice Lewisohn Crowley.

The current bridge (number 01659) was built in 1918 by the Connecticut State Highway Department to replace a former steel-arch bridge built in 1891 known as the Huntington Bridge.

This project was initiated in response to a pedestrian vs automobile accident in 2011. The proposed improvements include the following: * Replace the sidewalk area on the south side of the bridge with a wider sidewalk for a pedestrian plaza and public space to include planter boxes, bi- directional cycle track, and pedestrian sidewalk. * Replace the sidewalk on the north side of the bridge with a narrower sidewalk. * Reconstruct the existing roadway with similar bituminous surface and concrete base. * Reconstruct the bridge concrete parapet and pilasters to be similar to the existing historic design and finish and meet standard heights and vehicular collision criteria, along with decorative railing similar to Veteran's Park. * Replacement of the existing \\"Cobra\\" style lighting, with decorative period light fixtures that meet dark-sky standards. * Provide decorative accent lighting on the bridge.

She graduated with the cand.oecon. degree in 1946, and was eventually hired as a research fellow at the Norwegian Institute for Social Research, which was established in 1950. Despite having a degree in economics, the prospect of making an academic career in this field became unsettling for Holter. In her early career, she researched the working life. After analyses of the role of women in the workforce, she began concentrating more on women's studies in general. As she took the dr.philos. degree in 1970 on the thesis Sex Roles and Social Structure (which was also selected for the Norwegian Sociology Canon in 2009‚Äì2011), Holter became a pioneer in this field in the Nordic countries. She was appointed professor at the University of Oslo in 1973. She continued researching gender roles, publishing Kvinners liv og arbeid: kj√∏nnsroller og sosial struktur in 1974. She later edited the books Familien i klassesamfunnet (1976), Kvinner i fellesskap (1982) and Patriarchy in a Welfare Society (1984). Her own works Tvang til seksualitet (1986) and Sex i arbeid(et) i Norge (1992) pertained to the field of gender and sexuality studies, and the former became controversial.

From 1920 to 1925 he served as the first President of the new Central Legislative Assembly of British India. Biography Alexander Frederick Whyte was born on 30 September 1883, the second of eight children, and eldest son born to the Reverend Alexander Whyte DD, and Jane Elizabeth Barbour, who married in 1881. Whyte attended Edinburgh Academy and read modern languages at Jena University and at Edinburgh University, graduating with a first class. During this time he was President of Edinburgh University Union, and after graduation was warden of the Edinburgh University Settlement in 1907‚Äì8. He entered Parliament as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Perth (1910‚Äì1918), during which time he had been parliamentary private secretary (1910‚Äì1915) to Winston Churchill,p40, The Letters of Arnold Stephenson Rowntree - Liberal MP for York and member of the Quaker family of confectioners who was Home Secretary (1910‚Äì1911), and then First Lord of the Admiralty (1911‚Äì15) at the time. During the Great War, Whyte was a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on special service (1914‚Äì17).Who‚Äôs Who (1927) He was appointed the first President of the Central Legislative Assembly in India (1920‚Äì25). He then took on ambassadorial roles; as political advisor to the National Government of China (1929‚Äì32), Director General of the English-Speaking Union (1938), and Head of the American division of the Ministry of Information (1939‚Äì40). He was also involved in journalism, as the founder and editor of The New Europe (1917‚Äì1920), a well-known weekly read by political leaders and students,http://murphylibrary.uwlax.edu/digital/uwl/racquet/1932_1933/I004.PDF and was the author of numerous books discussing the politics and economics of the Orient. Aside from these political roles, Sir Frederick was Chairman of the Indian Red Cross Society (1923) and Reindeer Council of the United Kingdom, as well as being a member of the Athenaeum Club, founded in Liverpool in the late 18th century for the exchange of ideas.Who's Who Sir Alexander Frederick was knighted in 1922, and in 1925 a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India was conferred in Birthday Honours. Though gazetted on 3 June 1925 as Sir Alexander Whyte, he may have adopted the use of his middle name to avoid confusion with an Alexander Whyte (1834-1908) employed as a government botanist under the British administration in Nyasaland (now Malawi), where he established Zomba Botanic Garden between 1891 and 1895. It is unclear what involvement in public life Sir Frederick played following 1940. He was no longer at the Ministry of Information, but there is reference to him as Chairman of the recently founded Reindeer Council of the United Kingdom in the Nature of November 1949, following proposals to introduce reindeer to Britain. Further correspondence suggests that as late as 1958, Sir Frederick still had some association with the Indian Red Cross and St. John Ambulance Association and Brigade.p138 Dr Rajendra Prasad Correspondence and Select Documents, 30 July, 6 August A passenger list of that year reveals that Sir Alexander and Lady Fairweather Whyte set sail from Tenerife to England by first class, and Sir Alexander is described as a director.movinghere.org.uk, record from National Archives[PRO/BT26/1412/8151] In 1927, Sir Frederick sat for the photographer Walter Stoneman (1876‚Äì1958), and the bromide print along with two negatives remain part of the National Portrait Gallery‚Äôs collection.

The squadron is geographically separated but operated from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. It conducts testing and evaluation of the B-2 Spirit aircraft. Mission The squadron is the focal point for executing operational test and evaluation of the $44.6 billion B-2 weapon system. The squadron evaluates the ability of the B-2 weapons system to support all major requirements and reports weapon system capabilities. The unit provides experienced operations, maintenance, engineering, and analysis personnel who plan and conduct ground and flight tests, and analyze, evaluate, and report on the effectiveness and suitability of B-2 logistics support, tactics and survivability, foreign military exploitation, weapons and mission planning. The squadron reports results and conclusions to support DoD acquisition, deployment and employment decisions. HistoryWorld War I= The squadron was formed in Texas in early 1918. After a period of training and organization, it departed from New York in the late summer of 1918, arriving in France on 4 September. It stayed two weeks at the Air Service Replacement Concentration Barracks, St. Maixent, then transited through Delouze Aerodrome before reaching Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome where it worked for the 1st Air Depot as \\"Advance Section, Serv. of Supply Air Park Squadron\\". It remained in France after the armistice until June 1919, arriving back in New York and subsequently demobilized in July. =Interwar years= Reorganized in 1923 as a reconnaissance squadron, assigned to 5th Composite Group in Hawaii as part of the islands air defense organization. Assigned to Luke Field on Ford Island. Activities included training, participating in Army-Navy maneuvers, staging aerial reviews and sowing seeds from the air for the Territorial Forestry Division. In 1935, the squadron helped save the city of Hilo, Hawaii, during the eruption of the Mauna Loa volcano. Ten Keystone B-3 and Keystone B-4 bombers from the group‚Äôs 23d and 72d Bombardment Squadrons dropped twenty 600-pound bombs around the volcano to divert molten lava away from the town. =World War II= When the Navy moved its Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor in 1939, the squadron moved to Hickam Field. Was equipped with a mixture of Douglas B-18 Bolos and early B-17C/D Flying Fortresses in 1941 when the Japanese attacked Hawaii. The group suffered devastating personnel and aircraft losses in the Pearl Harbor Attack, remaining in Hawaii until September 1942 re-equipping. Deployed to the South Pacific, engaging in long-range bombing of enemy targets in the Solomon Islands and Central Pacific using Very Long-Range Consolidated B-24 Liberators. participating in MacArthur's island-hopping campaign in New Guinea and the Dutch East Indies. Participated in the Philippines Campaign, earning a Philippine Presidential Unit Citation for its actions in combat, 1944‚Äì1945. Inactivated at Clark Field, 1947 although most personnel had already returned to the United States. =Strategic reconnaissance= Reactivated at Ladd Field, Alaska in 1947 assuming the mission, personnel and equipment of the 46th Reconnaissance Squadron with a mission to conduct strategic reconnaissance operations over the Arctic. The squadron's reconnaissance missions included electronic and weather monitoring flights used to track Soviet activities in the area. Between 1948-1949 the Boeing RB-29 Superfortresses of the 72d conducted numerous photographic reconnaissance and ELINT missions over the Soviet Arctic and Far East. Equipped with cameras that enabled then to remain in international airspace, whilst photographing targets deep inside Soviet territory, the aircraft searched for evidence of Soviet military activity, but unsurprisingly, found little going on in the inhospitable Arctic wastes but nobody knew what was happening further inland. To investigate activity deeper inside the Soviet Union, some RB-29s were stripped of all unnecessary equipment, allowing them to increase their operating ceiling, and began overflying Soviet territory.Wack, Fred J. The Secret Explorers: Saga of the 46th/72nd Reconnaissance Squadrons. N.p., 1990 President Harry Truman, authorized the first overflight on 5 August 1948 when an RB-29 took off from Ladd AFB and, after routing over Siberia and spending over 19 hours in the air, eventually landed at Yokota Air Base, Japan. Even longer flights soon became routine with aircraft operating up to 35,000 ft, covering 5000 miles and remaining airborne for occasionally up to 30 hours. Although the Soviet Military was equipped rudimentary radar, copied from World War II US supplied equipment, large gaps existed in their radar coverage, particularly over the vast Arctic region. These gaps were soon identified and exploited by the RB-29s as they penetrated deeper inside the Soviet Union. Although they were detected on many occasions, none of the RB-29s was ever intercepted because the early MiG-15 was the only fighter with sufficient performance to reach these high-flying aircraft and none of the new fighters were then stationed in Siberia. The most significant of these missions included one on 3 September 1949 which identified the first evidence of a successful explosion of a Soviet nuclear weapon in the Semipalatinsk test site in Eastern Kazakhstan on 29 August 1949. =Strategic bombardment= Moved to the Continental United States in 1951, being re-equipped with Very Long Range RB-36H Peacemaker strategic reconnaissance bombers and assigned to the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base, California. The aircraft were equipped with four J47 jet engines and with fourteen K-17C, K-22A, K-38, and K-40 cameras. It also received some advanced electronics. Its normal crew was 22, which included 5 gunners to man the 16 M-24A-1 20-mm cannon. Conducted global strategic reconnaissance until 1955, conducting ELINT and Ferret missions along the east Asian coastline. Gradually shifting to bombardment training mission beginning in 1954 as the 72d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy, on 1 October 1955. Flew B-36Js heavy bombers until their phaseout in 1958, being reassigned to the 4134th Strategic Wing, being re- equipped with Boeing B-52F Stratofortress intercontinental heavy bombers. Was reassigned to Mather Air Force Base, California by SAC to disperse its heavy bomber force. Conducted worldwide strategic bombardment training missions and providing nuclear deterrent. Was inactivated in 1963 when SAC inactivated its strategic wings, replacing them with permanent Air Force Wings. Squadron was inactivated with its aircraft, personnel and equipment being transferred to the 441st Bombardment Squadron. Reactivated as a B-52H heavy bomb squadron at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota in late 1994, but inactivated on 1 July 1996. =Test and evaluation= Reactivated as a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber evaluation squadron in 1998.

He served as the Archbishop of Dublin in the Church of Ireland from 1779 until his death in 1801. Life Robert Fowler was born on 23 December 1724, and baptized at Skendleby Thorpe, Lincolnshire, England. He was the third son of George and Mary Fowler (n√©e Hurst) of Skendleby Thorpe. After an education at Westminster School, he was elected a King's Scholar in 1744. On 24 May of that year he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1747, a Master of Arts degree in 1751, and a Doctor of Divinity degree in 1764. He married Mildred, eldest daughter (and coheir of her brother, also William) of William Dealtry of Gainsborough, County Lincolnshire, on 29 October 1766. Together, they had one son and two daughters. An appointment as Chaplain to King George II in 1756 led Robert Fowler to a seat as Dean and Prebendary of Westminster Abbey from 1765 to 1771. A prebend at Westminster was highly sought after by the ecclesiastical establishment. The value of the prebend helped to enrich the salaries of bishops, who retained their prebends at Westminster whilst in another office. Robert Fowler was nominated on 13 June and consecrated on 28 July 1771, Bishop of Killaloe and Kilfenora in Ireland. On 22 December 1778, during the administration of Lord Buckingham, he was translated to the archiepiscopal see of Dublin. His letters patent were issued by King George III on 8 January 1779, and on the 13th of the same month he was consecrated and enthroned in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, as Archbishop of Dublin and Primate of Ireland. On 16 January, he was consecrated and enthroned at St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. The elevation to the Archbishopric of Dublin in 1779 also led him to a seat on the Irish Privy Council. The Irish Privy Council was a private committee of King George III's closest advisors to give confidential advice on affairs of state. In 1783 Robert Fowler was appointed the position of Chancellor of the 'Order of St. Patrick'. The 'Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick', as it is formally known, is a British order of chivalry associated with Ireland and was created by King George III on 5 February 1783. In William Domville Handcock's book, The History and Antiquities of Tallaght in the County of Dublin (published 1877), the writer recounts a brief detail of a Vestry meeting in 1783. During the Vestry meeting, it was proposed that a throne be erected, or a suitable pew enclosed, for the use of the Archbishop in Tallaght Church. However, Archbishop Fowler declined the honor, stating that one seat should not be more decorated than another in a parish church. This account would support why his parishioners and contemporaries thought him a kind, courteous and affable man‚Äîas he was also described in Samuel Burdy's The Life of Philip Skelton (published 1792). Fowler opposed the evangelicals and banned two ordained clergy for preaching justification by faith. As a result, they founded the breakaway Kellyite sect, which lingered on into the 1850s. In 1782 he was one of 12 Spiritual Peers in the Irish House of Lords who opposed the Bill for the relief of Dissenters on the grounds that it would promote clandestine & improvident marriages. In 1789 he joined with 14 other peers in protest at the appointment of the Prince of Wales as Regent during the temporary illness of King George III. On the basis of these political activities Fowler made his request to become a Temporal (hereditary) Peer. The government under William Pitt refused his request on the grounds that he had done no more than his duty as archbishop. Fowler was furious, and traveled to England to remonstrate with Pitt, to no avail. It would seem from the evidence that in spite of Philip Skelton's commendation of Fowler's great regard for religion, his main interests were in family, gardens and with little reverence for antiquities. The garden of the Palace of Tallaght was brought to a high state of perfection. Sadly, in 1793, Fowler's wife died and was buried at Tallaght Church. In March 1798, intelligence from informants among the United Irishmen caused the British Government to sweep up most of their leadership in Dublin. Martial law was imposed over most of the country, and its unrelenting force put the United Irish organization under severe pressure to act before it was too late. During the absence of the Archbishop in 1798, Tallaght Palace was attacked by armed men and various weapons were stolen. The Irish Rebellion was to follow, and these factors may have decided a prelate, who was already known as an absentee, to travel to England. In his justification and defense it must be said that Robert Fowler was not alone in being an absentee prelate during the gradual clashes between the United Irish and British Government. As early as 1782, the Irish Patriot Party, led by Henry Grattan, pushed for greater enfranchisement. They used their newly powerful position to force the Crown to grant the landed Ascendancy self-rule and a more independent parliament. In 1793, parliament passed laws allowing Catholics with property to vote, but they could neither be elected nor appointed as state officials. In response, liberal elements among the ruling class were inspired by the example of the American Revolution (1776‚Äì1783) and the French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799), which had taken place in a Catholic country. They sought to form a common cause with the Catholic populace to achieve reform and greater autonomy from Britain. The Insurrection Act of 1796 was passed to suppress the growing number of meetings, distributed literature, and \\"disturbances of the public peace\\" by the United Irish. This Act did little to halt organization and growing sentiment for the United Irish movement or the uprisings which ultimately led to the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Within the next six years, however, the rebellion and residual pockets of resistance were vanquished by British forces. Due to ill health, Archbishop Fowler lived the remaining two years of his life at Bassingbourne Hall in Takeley, Essex, England, a seat which he rented from Sir Peter Parker, 1st Baronet (who himself purchased the estate from Francis Bernard, 1st Earl of Bandon). Fowler lived to see the 'Union with Ireland Act' and the 'Act of Union' pass in 1800. He died on 10 October 1801, at Bassingbourne Hall, and was buried at Holy Trinity Church in Takeley on 19 October. Archbishop Fowler's children were to fulfill his ambitions to become a member of the Peerage. Eldest daughter Mildred (who became Countess of Kilkenny) married in 1793 Edmund Butler, 12th Lord Viscount Mountgarret and 1st (and last) Earl of Kilkenny. Robert Fowler's 2nd daughter Frances married in 1795 Richard Bourke, Bishop of Waterford and Lismore and younger brother to the 4th Earl of Mayo; their son became the 5th Earl of Mayo when the 4th Earl died without issue. Robert Fowler's only son Robert was consecrated Bishop of Ossory in 1813, then in 1835 became the inaugural Bishop of Ossory, Ferns and Leighlin. He married in 1796 the Honorable Louisa Gardiner, eldest daughter of Luke Gardiner, 1st Viscount Mountjoy, and sister to Charles Gardiner, 1st Earl of Blessington. Until fairly recently, the exact burial place of such a man of importance at Holy Trinity Church had presented something of a mystery, as there was no memorial, tomb, or tablet of any kind to him. The discovery of a vault filled in during the Victorian restoration has solved this mystery, and it is now known that Robert Fowler, Archbishop of Dublin, is buried under the Chancel (or Altar) of the Holy Trinity Church, Takeley. Bassingbourne Hall, the great house built by William Towse in circa 1580, and the last residence of Archbishop Fowler, was demolished in 1813 according to the will of the owner, Sir Peter Parker. The house demolished in 1988 to make way for the expansion of Stansted Airport was originally the Home Farm House of Bassingourne Hall and took on the name when that building was razed.

Life Louise Eleonore was a daughter of Prince Christian Albert Louis of Hohenlohe- Langenburg and his wife Princess Caroline of Stolberg-Gedern (1732‚Äì1796). On 27 November 1782, in Langenburg, she married George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. =Regency= When her husband died on 24 December 1803, she took over as regent of the duchy for their son Bernhard II. She ruled with energy, courage, and good sense during the Napoleonic Wars, which for the next decade ravaged the Saxon states.Koller, p. 30. The duchy was forced to join the Confederation of the Rhine during these Wars and provide it with troops; afterwards the duchy was struck with famine, which Luise sought to prevent by importing wheat. Despite the fact that French and later Russian armies marched back and forth across the country, Luise refused to flee; she stayed with her infant son and two daughters inside their castle. She used every strategy to preserve the autonomy of her regency, so that when she joined the Allies in 1813, she had saved the duchy for her son. He became the ruling Duke of Meiningen eight years later. By adjustments in the duchy's administration she ensured the duchy was better managed and in 1821 opened the Gymnasium Bernhardinum in Meiningen (already begun by her husband). Her children were carefully educated, with a grand tour to Italy under their tutor Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.

It contains an important dissenting judgment by Bramwell LJ, who wished to dispose of it. Facts Mr Grant applied for shares in the Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Company. The company allotted the shares to the defendant, and duly addressed to him, posting a letter containing the notice of allotment. The letter was lost in the post and he never received the acceptance. Later the company went bankrupt, and asked Mr Grant for the outstanding payments on the shares, which he refused saying there was no binding contract. The liquidator sued. The question was whether Mr Grant's offer for shares had been validly accepted and as such whether he was legally bound to pay. Judgment Thesiger LJ for the majority held that there was a valid contract, because the rule for the post is that acceptance is effective even if the letter never arrives. He noted that anyone can opt out of the rule, and that even if it sometimes causes hardship, it would cause even more hardship to not have the rule. Once someone posts acceptance, he argued, there is a meeting of minds, and by doing that decisive act a contract should come into effect. Bramwell LJ gave a spirited dissent, concluding that acceptance should only be effective once it arrives (but see also an apropos 1974 case,The Brimnes).

Early years A member of the aristocratic Norman House of Harcourt, d'Harcourt was born at Lumigny-Nesles-Ormeaux in Seine-et-Marne, the second son and fourth child of Count Pierre d'Harcourt and Adelaide-Alix de Mun. He was the nephew of Albert de Mun, a half-brother of his mother. D'Harcourt studied Germanic literature at university. His doctoral dissertation was on the Swiss poet and novelist Conrad Ferdinand Meyer. During World War I, d'Harcourt served in the artillery with the rank of sergeant. He was severely wounded twice during the conflict. Eventually taken prisoner, he recounted his experiences in his memoir, Souvenirs de captivit√© et d'√©vasion d'un camp de Bavi√®re. After the war, he obtained the chair of German language and literature at the Institut catholique de Paris.academie-francaise Biography Anti-Nazism D'Harcourt's knowledge of German culture and his anti-Nazi views led him to publish numerous detailed articles attacking the new Nazi regime after Hitler achieved power in 1933. In 1936 he published l'√âvangile de la force (The Gospel of Force), his best-known work. It was a harsh attack on Nazism and particularly drew attention to the indoctrination of young Germans in Nazi ideology. Harcourt stressed the incompatibility between the radical racist nature of Nazi ideology and Christianity. During the Occupation, d'Harcourt became a leading intellectual figure in the Resistance, publishing in the clandestine press. His two sons, Anne-Pierre d'Harcourt (1913‚Äì1981) and Charles d'Harcourt (1921‚Äì1992), were both sent to Buchenwald concentration camp but survived the war. Post-war After the war d'Harcourt was one of five new members elected on 14 February 1946 to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. This group election was caused by many vacancies resulting from the war. He was received on 30 January 1947 by Henry Bordeaux, with Andr√© Bellessort in the chair. Most of d'Harcourt's later publications were about the culture and politics of post-war Germany under Konrad Adenauer. D'Harcourt died in 1965, and rests in the cemetery of Pargny-l√®s-Reims. Private life In July 1912, Harcourt married Ghislaine de Caraman-Chimay (1894‚Äì1965), daughter of Prince Pierre de Riquet de Caraman- Chimay. Their son Anne-Pierre married firstly Florence d'Harcourt, with whom he had one daughter, Sophie d'Harcourt (born 1947), and secondly Laurian Jones, the only daughter of Enid Bagnold and Sir Roderick Jones.‚ÄúJONES sir George Roderick otherwise Sir Roderick K.B.E.‚Äù in Probate Index for 1962, at probatesearch.service.gov.uk, accessed 15 April 2020 Works *C.

History After the British gained control of the Kandyan Kingdom in 1815 by the Kandyan Convention it governed the former Kandyan Kingdom as a protectorate. However following the Uva Rebellion, three years later in which Kandy was captured by the rebels, the British moved to combined both parts of the island under a central administration. However Kandy remained an important city second only to the capital Colombo. Therefore a European-style palace was constructed in the late 18th century for the use of the British Governor of Ceylon during his visits to the city. This was used for hosting Royal visits to Kandy, most notably that of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1875. In 1944, during the Second World War, the South East Asia Command of the allies was moved to Kandy, where it remained till the end of the war. Admiral Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander of the South East Asia Command, took up residence at the Governor's Pavilion till the end of the war.

Sam typically played guitar and Kirk usually played banjo or fiddle, although they were both proficient in multiple string instruments. The McGee Brothers were one of the most enduring acts on the Grand Ole Opry during the show's first fifty years. They made their initial appearance on the Opry in 1926 and the following year joined Uncle Dave Macon's band, the Fruit Jar Drinkers. In the 1930s, the McGees teamed up with early Opry fiddler Arthur Smith to form a string band known as the \\"Dixieliners,\\" and in the 1940s they played and toured with Bill Monroe and His Bluegrass Boys and several other notable acts. The McGee Brothers saw a brief resurgence during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, when folk artist Mike Seeger managed to reunite them with Arthur Smith. The brothers made their last major appearance as a duo on the Opry in 1974, although Kirk continued to appear regularly on the program until his death in 1983.Colin Larkin (ed.), \\"Sam and Kirk McGee.\\" The Encyclopedia of Popular Music (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 638.

As a teenager, Sam picked up slide- guitar and other blues techniques from African-American railroad workers and street musicians in his native Williamson County, and he and Kirk subsequently adapted blues and ragtime styles to the string band format.Charles Wolfe, \\"McGee Brothers.\\" The Encyclopedia of Country Music: The Ultimate Guide to the Music (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), 340-1.

In 1926, Sam and Macon appeared together on the WSM Barn Dance (which later became the Grand Ole Opry) and recorded several sides, including Sam's guitar solos, \\"Buck Dancer's Choice\\" and \\"Knoxville Blues.\\" Shortly afterward, a recording scout suggested Macon form a larger band, and Sam, Kirk, guitarist Hubert Gregory, and bassist Golden Stewart joined with Macon as \\"Uncle Dave Macon and the Fruit Jar Drinkers\\" (Macon chose the name \\"Fruit Jar Drinkers\\", ignoring the fact that another band was already using a similar name). The band made several Opry appearances, and travelled to New York to record several tracks, including \\"I'm Goin' Away in the Morn\\" and \\"Bake That Chicken Pie\\" (by the time it recorded, the band's line-up had shifted to include Macon's neighbor, fiddler Mazy Todd). At the same sessions, the McGees recorded several tracks as a duo, including \\"Old Master's Runaway,\\" which was based on the American Civil War folk song, \\"Year of Jubilo.\\" Sam also recorded \\"Chevrolet Car\\", which he had learned from a mechanic in Nashville, and tried unsuccessfully to sell it to the Chevrolet Corporation.Charles Wolfe, \\"Notes to Volume 2.\\" In Nashville - The Early String Bands, Vol. 2 (pp. 6-9) [CD liner notes]. County Records, 2000. On \\"Chevrolet Car\\" and on several tracks recorded with Macon in the late 1920s, Sam played a banjo-guitar, providing rare early instances of this instrument being played effectively. 1930s and 1940s While the McGee Brothers continued performing with Macon over the years, by 1930 their main focus had turned to performing as a duo and with fellow Opry pioneer \\"Fiddlin'\\" Arthur Smith. In 1931, the McGees and Smith formed the \\"Dixieliners,\\" a string band named after the railroad where Smith worked.Jack Hurst, Nashville's Grand Ole Opry (New York: H.N. Abrams, 1975), 98. The group toured and made numerous appearances on the Opry, but didn't make any recordings until their reunion two decades later (Smith's \\"Dixieliner\\" recordings from the 1930s were accompanied by the Delmore Brothers, rather than the McGees). Sam and Kirk made several recordings during the 1930s as a duo, however, most notably \\"Brown's Ferry Blues,\\" which they recorded in 1934. Sam also claimed to have been the first performer to play an electric guitar on the Opry, for which he was chided by Opry founder George D. Hay, who told him the electric guitar was not \\"down to Earth.\\"Hurst, 115. The Dixieliners disbanded in 1938. In the 1940s, the McGee Brothers performed with some of the biggest names in country and bluegrass, among them Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, and Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys. They also continued making appearances on the Grand Ole Opry, sometimes accompanying their old bandmate, Uncle Dave Macon.Arthur Butterfield, Encyclopedia of Country Music (New York: Gallery Books, 1985), 82. Early in the decade, they worked briefly with the comedy act, Sara and Sally. Later career The McGee Brothers continued performing throughout the 1950s, both as a duo and occasionally as solo acts. During the folk revival of the late 1950s, the McGees were \\"rediscovered\\", and experienced a brief resurgence in popularity. Folk song enthusiast Mike Seeger managed to reunite them with Arthur Smith in 1957, and the trio made several recordings. The trio played at various folk music festivals throughout the 1960s, including a well- received performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. By the 1970s, the McGees were again playing primarily as a duo. They performed at the Opry's last Ryman Auditorium show on March 15, 1974, and as the Opry's senior members, were among the first acts to play at the show's new Opryland venue the following Saturday night.Sandra Brennan, \\"Sam McGee.\\" Retrieved: 16 December 2008. Journalist Garrison Keillor, covering the Opry's move for the New Yorker, described the McGee Brothers' performance thus: > It was the acoustic moment of the show, when the skies cleared and the > weeping steels were silent and out of the clear blue came a little ole > guitar duet.

On August 28, 1975, Sam was killed in a tractor accident on the family farm in Williamson County. After Sam's death, Kirk continued performing, mostly as a regular fiddler on the Opry. He died of a heart attack on October 24, 1983, a few days after his last appearance on the program.

In that Report, the Committee noted that two factors had been influential in causing diverse social problems in psychiatry: the role of prejudice in determining attitudes towards social problems and the sparse knowledge about the relationship between society and personality. In this pioneering document, the Committee on Social Issues emphasized the social responsibility of psychiatry. It made a number of suggestions for broadening the conceptual framework of psychiatry to include: \\"redefinition of the concept of mental illness, emphasizing those dynamic principles which pertain to the person's interaction with society ... examination of the social factors which contribute to the causation of mental illness and also influence its course and outcome ... consideration of the specific group psychological phenomena which are relevant, in a positive sense, to community mental health ... the development of criteria for social action, relevant to the promotion of individual and community mental health.\\" By 1955 the group was advocating an \\"objective critical attitude should orient the field.Lane, Christopher (2007).

Suction may be used to clear the airway of blood, saliva, vomit, or other secretions so that a patient may breathe. Suctioning can prevent pulmonary aspiration, which can lead to lung infections. In pulmonary hygiene, suction is used to remove fluids from the airways, to facilitate breathing and prevent growth of microorganisms. Small suction-providing devices are often called aspirators. In surgery suction can be used to remove blood from the area being operated on to allow surgeons to view and work on the area. Suction may also be used to remove blood that has built up within the skull after an intracranial hemorrhage.

Like them, he changes the bindings of his wounds, but does so one wound at the time, in order to be ready at a moment's notice.\\" Then Joshua went to Rome and met the Messiah and greeted him, saying \\"peace upon thee, Master and Teacher\\" and the Messiah replied \\"peace upon thee, O son of Levi.\\" Joshua then asked \\"When will you be coming?\\" and was told \\"Today!\\". Joshua went back to Elijah and was asked what the Messiah said. 'Peace upon thee, O son of Levi', Joshua replied, and Elijah told him that that meant that he and his father would have a place in the world to come. Joshua then said that the Messiah had not told him the truth, because he had promised to come today but had not. Elijah explained \\"This is what he said to thee, To-day, if ye will hear his voice\\", a reference to Psalms 95:7, making his coming conditional with the condition not fulfilled.Babylonian Talmud: Tractate Sanhedrin Folio 98aSchwartz, Howard, Caren Loebel-Fried, & Elliot K.

Eerdmans Publishing, 1990; , ;p. 99 Reception Medieval Jews saw the story as possibly anti-Roman, and Rashi interpreted 'Rome' as meaning not the physical city but the part of paradise overlooking Rome. This neutralised and spiritualised the story and reconciled it with legends of the Messiah being carried alive to paradise. Later, Maharsha went further and suggested that Rome wasn't mentioned at all as 'de Romi' should be read 'deromi', southern, referring to the Messiah being found in the southern part of paradise. In the early 16th century the Kabbalist Abraham ben Eliezer ha-Levi suggested that the 'Rome' in the story was a small town in Galilee with the same name, and a bit later Moshe Alshich put the Messiah in paradise overlooking this town. Concern about being seen as anti- Roman also led to translations of the Talmud replacing the word 'Rome' in this story to 'the city', 'Karta'.Berger, Abraham \\"Captivity at the Gate of Rome: the story of a Messianic Motif\\", Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 44 (1977), pp. 1-17 Sources *Midrash Tanhuma 9:1 *Leviticus Rabbah 19 *Pesikta 36a References Category:Jewish eschatology Category:Jewish messianism Category:Talmud ","title":"The Messiah at the Gates of Rome"},{"id":"20729126","text":"Abali (ƒÄlƒÅrƒÅn), (, also Romanized as ƒÄb øalƒ´) is a city in Rudehen District of Damavand County, Tehran Province, Iran.

He wrote fiction, in the comedy and thriller genres and had more than 40 books published between 1968 and 2006. Biography Originally an actor, Morgan had many jobs as a young man, including sewing machine salesman, debt collector and bank clerk. In 1951, Morgan emigrated to Canada where he spent some time working in the Bank of Nova Scotia. In 1955, he emigrated again, this time to Southern Rhodesia. He resumed his acting career there and was sponsored to return to London after winning a Best Actor award. Upon returning to London, Morgan featured mostly in voice-overs (\\"Mullardability\\" the documentary he voiced for Mullard was nominated for the Special Film BAFTA in 1970List of 1970 BAFTA nominations), although he did have a small role in the James Bond film Dr. No playing the Concierge in the casino who first introduces Sean Connery as James Bond. Most of his acting credits were in second-feature crime shorts filmed at Merton Park Studios. Whilst between acting jobs in the late 1960s, Morgan began to write seriously and his first novel The Sewing Machine Man was published in 1968. Allegedly autobiographical, the novel revolved around the character Russ Tobin and Morgan went on to write a further 18 novels in the series. The latest of the Russ Tobin novels was published in 2005 after Morgan came out of retirement, mainly due to renewed interest in his work via the internet. Along with George Harrison and Paul McCartney, Morgan was an alumnus of the Liverpool Institute High School for Boys, which he attended between 1945 and 1946 In August 2018, Morgan's webmaster announced his death on his website.Stanley Morgan death notice Morgan died on 24 August 2018.

Discovering extensive French and Spanish colonial documents related to the slave trade in Louisiana, she wrote Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro- Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century (1992), studied the ethnic origins of enslaved Africans brought to Louisiana, as well as the process of creolization which created new cultures. She changed the way in which several related disciplines are researched and taught, adding to scholarly understanding of the diverse origins of cultures throughout the Americas. In addition, Midlo Hall created a database of records identifying and describing more than 100,000 enslaved Africans. It has become a primary resource for historical and genealogical research. She earned recognition in academia, and has been featured in the New York Times, People Magazine, ABC News, BBC, and other popular outlets for her contributions to scholarship, genealogy, and the critical reevaluation of the history of slavery. Midlo Hall is an award- winning author and Professor Emerita of Latin American and Caribbean History, Rutgers University, New Jersey. Since 2010 she is Professor of History at Michigan State University.  Biography Early life and education= Gwendolyn Midlo was born June 27, 1929, in New Orleans, Louisiana, the daughter of Ethel and Herman L. Midlo, a civil rights and labor attorney. Her parents were of Russian- and Polish-Jewish ancestry. She was influenced by her father's activism.\\"Gwendolyn Midlo Hall\\", JRank Encyclopedia, accessed 17 Jan 2009. In 1990 her mother founded the Ethel and Herman Midlo Center for New Orleans Studies at the University of New Orleans, where her father had donated his papers.Midlo Center for New Orleans Studies at the University of New Orleans, accessed 30 May 2017. Midlo has had a career marked by early political activism as well as academic scholarship. After World War II, at age 16 in 1945, Hall helped organize and participated in the New Orleans Youth Council, an interracial, direct-action community group, which encouraged and helped African-American voter registration and defied racial segregation laws. In 1946 she was elected to the Executive Board of the Southern Negro Youth Congress at the Southern Youth Legislature in Columbia, South Carolina. It had operated since 1937 to end lynching, racial discrimination and segregation, and to achieve voting rights for all.Jacqueline Dowd Hall, \\"The Long Civil Rights Movement\\" Midlo helped organize Young Progressives, an interracial youth and student movement in segregated New Orleans that included students from Tulane University, Newcomb College, and Loyola University (white colleges) and from Dillard and Xavier universities (historically black colleges.) She was active in the 1948 presidential campaign of Henry Wallace, the Progressive Party candidate, working in New Orleans, rural Louisiana, and Atlanta, Georgia. She also was active in the Civil Rights Congress and the Southern Conference for Human Welfare. Starting at Sophie Newcomb College of Tulane University, Midlo studied history. After years of political activism and marriage, Midlo Hall completed some of her academic studies outside the United States, which gave her broader insight as she acquired fluency in French and Spanish and could use archives in other countries. She earned a B.A. in history at Mexico City College, 1962 and a master's in Latin American History, also at Mexico City College in 1963-64. While a doctoral graduate student at the University of Michigan, Midlo Hall published an article advocating medical treatment for heroin addicts: \\"Mechanisms for Exploiting the Black Community\\", The Negro Digest, November 1969. It inspired demonstrations in the streets of Detroit. She organized methadone-maintenance treatment programs in both Detroit and Ann Arbor, Michigan. Adoption of such treatment by major cities helped reduce heroin use and the crime rate in the inner city of Detroit and others.Eric C. Schneider. Smack: Heroin and the American City, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008., , pp. 40, 169-72. pp. ix-xvi, 1-259 Midlo Hall earned a Ph.D. in Latin American History at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1970. =Academic career= Midlo Hall and Haywood moved to Mexico City, Mexico, in early 1959, shortly before he was expelled from the Communist Party over ideological differences. Midlo Hall completed her B.A. and master's degrees in Mexico City before returning to the US in 1964. In 1966 she started her graduate studies to earn her doctorate at the University of Michigan. The couple separated and she raised their children by herself after 1964. In 1965, while teaching black students at Elizabeth City State College in North Carolina, Midlo Hall encouraged them to organize armed resistance against the Ku Klux Klan and to oppose the United States military intervention in Vietnam.Hall, \\"Rural, Black College\\", Negro Digest, March 1969.

Williams when he was extradited from Michigan to Monroe, North Carolina, in 1975. During the 1960s and early 1970s, she published a number of influential essays in African-American magazines. Midlo Hall was fired and blacklisted in 1965 by Elizabeth City State College and the F.B.I. for her activities.Gwendolyn Midlo Hall collection, Bentley Historical Library. When she moved to Michigan, Midlo Hall worked in Detroit during 1965 and 1966, often with Grace Lee Boggs, as a temporary legal secretary. She had to keep a step ahead of the F.B.I. which tried to get her fired from wherever she worked.Freedom of Information Act files for Gwendolyn Midlo Hall; Gwendolyn Midlo Hall collection, Bentley Historical Library The F.B.I. engineered the eviction of Midlo Hall and her two young children from three apartments which she rented in Michigan during her first year: two in Detroit and one in Ann Arbor.Gwendolyn Midlo Hall collection, Bentley Historical Library She persisted in completing course work and her Ph.D. dissertation for her doctorate, which was published as Social Control in Slave Plantation Societies: A Comparison of St. Domingue and Cuba (1971) by Johns Hopkins University Press. After completing her doctorate, Midlo Hall started as an assistant professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, where she advanced to full professor in 1993. She taught Caribbean and Latin American history, as well as classes on the African diaspora. Publication in 1992 of her Africans in Colonial Louisiana supported a reevaluation of African-American contributions to Louisiana and United States culture. She discovered significant colonial data in courthouses in Pointe Coupee Parish and others in Louisiana, and also used national and state archives in France, Spain and Texas. Finding that French and Spanish records had more details about the origins and individual characteristics of slaves than did those of the British and Americans, she developed important material on the cultures of Africans in Louisiana, documenting many individuals as part of specific ethnic cultures on the African continent. She worked for 15 years, five years with research assistants, to develop a searchable database on more than 100,000 slaves identified in historic records. These included Africans transported to Louisiana in the 18th and 19th centuries. The material was published on a CD in 2000 by Louisiana State University Press and online in 2001 by ibiblio. The database includes such details as slave name, gender, age, occupation, illnesses, family relationships, ethnicity, place of origin, prices paid by slave owners, slaves' testimony, and emancipations of slaves.\\"Slavery\\" , History, Stanford University Library, accessed 15 Jan 2009 While an influential academic work, her book Africans in Colonial Louisiana has also become popular among jazz musicians in New Orleans. It continues to be appreciated by Afro-Americans and many whites in Louisiana. New Orleans jazz musicians refer to it as the \\"purple book\\". It is an important starting point for people who want to learn more about African-American culture in Louisiana and elsewhere. In 2010 Midlo Hall accepted a position as Professor of History at Michigan State University, where she devotes most of her time to Biographies: The Atlantic Slave Database Network. Walter Hawthorne, Chair of the History Department, is co-principal investigator of this project. MATRIX provides the technology, hosting and storage. The project was initially funded by a contract from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Midlo Hall's work has been distinguished by her use of original language archives in France and Spain, as well as of records in Latin America, providing a broad base for comparison of slavery in different societies. She has published internationally in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese, and lectured internationally in English, French and Spanish. =Marriage and family= Midlo was married before 1951. Her oldest son Leonid Avram Yuspeh was born in Paris, France in 1951 from this marriage. After divorce, she next married Harry Haywood in 1956. He was a political activist, member of the Communist Party, USA, and theoretician of self-determination for the African-American nation of the Deep South. She changed her name at marriage to conform to his legal birth name of Haywood Hall. They were married until his death in 1985. Two children were born from this marriage: Dr. Haywood Hall, a world-renowned international emergency physician, and Rebecca Hall, an attorney with a Ph.D. in history . Between 1953 and 1964, Midlo Hall collaborated with Haywood in freelance writing about theoretical aspects of the civil rights and black protest movement in the United States. Some of these articles were a joint publication in several issues of Soulbook Magazine, which began publication in Berkeley, California in 1964.University of Michigan Library\\"Harry Haywood\\", University of Massachusetts WorksCollected papers= The Gwendolyn Midlo Hall papers (1939‚Äì1991) are housed at the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan and later ones associated with her work on Africans in Louisiana at the Amistad Research Center at Tulane University.

It is owned by Dine Brands Global‚Äîa company formed after IHOP's purchase of Applebee's, with 99% of the restaurants run by independent franchisees. While IHOP's focus is on breakfast foods, it also offers a menu of lunch and dinner items. The company has 1,841 locations in the Americas (United States, Canada, Mexico and Guatemala) and the Middle East (Dubai, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Qatar), including 161 that are owned by area licensees and 1,680 that are franchised. While many of its locations are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the chain's minimum operating hours are 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. History IHOP's former logo, used from 1994 to 2003. Logo used from 1994 to 2015 Jerry Lapin, Al Lapin, and Albert Kallis founded International House of Pancakes in 1958 with the help of Sherwood Rosenberg and William Kaye. The first restaurant opened in Toluca Lake, Los Angeles, California. The initial design for IHOP building was a steep-roofed A-frame building with a distinctive blue roof, the last such location to be built was completed in 1979. While most IHOP locations no longer use the A-frame buildings, several still exist around the U.S. In 1973, the chain's name was shortened to \\"IHOP\\" for marketing purposes, using a cartoon kangaroo in its commercials at the time, and since then the full name and acronym have been officially interchangeable. The breakfast food menu later expanded (especially in the 1980s) to include standard lunch and dinner items found in similar restaurant chains such as Sambo's and Denny's. In 1976, at the same time as reorganization International Industries became IHOP. In December 2019, IHOP announced plans to launch a chain of fast casual breakfast restaurants called Flip'd. =Acquisition of Applebee's= On July 16, 2007, IHOP Corporation announced a plan to acquire the bar-and-grill chain Applebee's in an all-cash transaction, valued at approximately US$2.1 billion. In the arrangement, Applebee's stock holders will receive $25.50 a share. IHOP stated it would franchise most of Applebee's 500 company-owned facilities. Applebee's had 1,943 restaurants worldwide at the time, including those operated by franchisees. Applebee's shareholders approved the acquisition with a 70% vote, which closed on November 29, 2007. A number of executives from Applebee's voted against the offer. The chain's largest individual shareholder, Applebee's director Burton \\"Skip\\" Sack, called the IHOP offer unfair to its shareholders and stated he planned to take IHOP to court to demand a higher price be paid to him. As part of the purchase, a brand remarketing scheme and revitalization of the Applebee's image was intended. The buyout successfully closed on November 29, 2007, and the corporate entity IHOP changed its name to DineEquity on June 2, 2008. A franchisee opened a hybrid Applebee's/IHOP restaurant in downtown Detroit in mid-2018.  Menu  IHOP Cheesecake Pancakes While IHOP's focus is on breakfast, serving pancakes, waffles, French toast, and omelettes, it also offers a menu of lunch and dinner items such as sandwiches, burgers, and salads.  Locations  The company has 1,841 locations in the Americas and the Middle East. Franchising agreements with M.H. Alshaya, an international restaurant-franchising firm, resulted in an agreement for Alshaya to open as many as forty IHOP locations in the Middle East, beginning in 2012. By the end of 2018, IHOP restaurants operated in six Middle Eastern countries: Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. In 2019, IHOP began its foray into South America, opening three locations in Ecuador. IHOP Express' first location opened in 2011, they are a quick service version of the chain offered at locations such as airports, school campuses, military food courts and travel centers. The first standalone public location of the concept opened in downtown San Diego in 2011. In 2019, IHOP announced plans to open a fast- casual restaurant, Flip'd by IHOP. Flip'd will include a menu serving pancake bowls, burgers, and fried chicken.  Marketing  In June 2015, IHOP introduced an updated logo, removing its decorative elements and adding a curved line under the \\"O\\" and \\"P\\" letters to resemble a smiley face. The company argued that the previous logo looked too much like a frown. In June 2018, an IHOP marketing campaign announced they would \\"flip\\" their name to \\"IHOb\\"; it was ultimately revealed to be a marketing campaign for its hamburgers, in an effort to address perceptions that IHOP was still primarily oriented towards breakfast food. The tease of the campaign led to speculation via social media regarding the intent of the change. IHOP parodied the campaign the following year to promote a new hamburger that includes a pancake as an ingredient, jokingly stating that they would refer to their burgers as \\"pancakes\\" because people wanted IHOP to \\"stick to pancakes\\". Lawsuit In early September 2010, IHOP filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles against International House of Prayer and six other defendants alleging trademark dilution and infringement. The lawsuit was dropped on December 21, 2010, with the dispute resolved out of court.

History The McClave Act was passed in 1939, and established uniform license requirements for anyone in New Jersey wishing to practice the healing arts. In 1953 the law was updated and chiropractors were then allowed to apply for licensure before an examining board consisting mostly of medical doctors and a single chiropractor. Over the next 30 years, New Jersey licensure laws continued to evolve with increasing educational and training requirements for chiropractors that were more in step with the national accreditation given to chiropractic colleges. The passage of the Chiropractic Board Act in 1989 instituted the New Jersey Board of Chiropractic Examiners, an oversight board for regulating all practicing chiropractors in New Jersey. The Board was created within the Division of Consumer Affairs and regulates the chiropractic profession. New Jersey Board of Chiropractic Examiners The New Jersey Board of Chiropractic Examiners consists of eleven members who reside in New Jersey. One member represents the New Jersey State Executive, two members are laypersons representing the public and the remaining eight members are licensed chiropractors who have actively practiced chiropractic in New Jersey for at least five years preceding their appointment to the Board.

Its aim was the creation of a value-added process by taking into account existing and current initiatives and mechanisms. Initiated at the International Conference \\"Biodiversity: Science and Governance\\" in January 2005, it ended in November 2007 with the final meeting of its International Steering Committee (ISC). IMoSEB results were congrued with the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment follow up to create the Intergovernmental Science-Policy platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), led by UNEP. IPBES first meeting took place in November 2008 in Putrajaya, Malaysia. Background International Conference \\"Biodiversity: Science and Governance\\" = During the International Conference held in January 2005, President Jacques Chirac launched a call for action to set up an IPCC like for biodiversity. The final declaration of the conference recommended in response, the launch of an international multi-stakeholder consultative process guided by a balanced multi-stakeholder steering committee. This process would assess the need for an international mechanism which would: * Provide a critical assessment of the scientific information and policy options required decision-making; * Build on existing bodies, current and recent activities A provisional steering committee, based on the scientific and organizational committee of the conference, was set up to define the IMoSEB steering committee and its modalities of work . =Open Science Conference DIVERSITAS= During the DIVERSITAS conference held in Oaxaca, in October 2005, the scientific community reiterated its support to the consultative process and for the establishment of a scientific panel on biodiversity that included an intergovernmental component =CBD SBSTTA 11= A first presentation of the consultative process, its modalities of work, its goals and possible outcomes, were presented during the 11th meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) SBSTTA in December 2006 Consultative process towards an IMoSEB International Steering Committee, Executive Committee, Executive Secretariat= The International Steering Committee (ISC) was composed of about 90 members: # Scientists from various disciplines (natural, social, applied and environmental sciences) and countries: Gaston Achoudong, Carlo Heip, Leonard Hirsch, Yvon Le Maho, Michel Loreau, Keping Ma, Georgina Mace, Alfred Oteng-Yeboah, Charles Perrings, Peter Raven, Jos√© Sarukh√°n, Robert Scholes, Arkady Tishkov, Jacques Weber; # Representatives of governments: Algeria, Austria, Canada, China, Costa-Rica, Denmark, France, Gabon, Germany, India, Iran, Italy, Jamaica, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Morocco, Namibia, New Zealand, Papua-New Guinea, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, UK, United States; # Inter-Governmental or international Organizations, United Nations and Specialized Agencies, Non-governmental organizations, Research initiatives and others: CITES, CMS, Conservation International, Diversitas, EPBRS, European Commission, EEA, FAO, GBIF, Greenpeace (as observer), ICES ‚Äì CIEM, ICSU, Institut Fran√ßais de la Biodiversit√©, International Indigenous Forum on Biodiversity, IPGRI, IUCN, Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, Ramsar Convention, RAIPON, Swedish Scientific Council on Biological Diversity, Swiss Biodiversity Forum, The Nature Conservancy, UN CBD, UN CBD - SBSTTA, UNCCD, UNEP - DEWA, UNEP - WCMC, UNESCO, United Nations University - IAS, World Bank, WWF.

Anne Larigauderie (DIVERSITAS) contributed to the work of this secretariat. =First ISC meeting and its conclusions= The consultative process was officially launched in February 2006 at its first meeting in Paris at the French National Museum of Natural History. More than 90 participants attended the meeting. The meeting overall ended with the agreement to *Undertake a review of what is needed in the biodiversity science-policy interface, based on a study of existing mechanisms; *Hold a consultation that would foster an open dialogue and explore different several possible options The Executive Committee was asked to consider these two tasks and developed a plan of action for the consultation A first step, based on case studies, aiming at: *Map out the decision-making landscape affecting biodiversity; *Analyze, using case studies, successes and failures to preserve biodiversity at different scales; *Analyze existing models delivering scientific expertise Based on the results of the studies, the Executive Committee identified a series of needs and formulated a number of possible options, as basis for discussion during regional consultations, seeking feedback on these propositions. =Case Studies= Several case studies on the science-policy interface on biodiversity and on How scientific is used in decision making processes have been conducted in 2006. * Conabio - the Mexican example * Invasive species * Fisheries and expertise * Avian flu * Traditional knowledge, scientific expertise and decision-making * Lessons from assessments =Needs&Options;= The following needs had been identified by the Executive Committee on the basis of the results of the case studies and from voluntary contributions about the effectiveness with which scientific and other relevant knowledge is used in decisions that affect biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well- being at the international scale. #To bring insights from the relevant sciences and other forms of knowledge to bear on local/national decisions that affect biodiversity where those decisions have international consequences, and where existing decision-processes appear to be relatively ill-informed by science and other forms of relevant knowledge (e.g. on transmission of invasive pests and pathogens, and exploitation of common pool resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction). #To provide independent scientific information from all relevant sources to support the work of international conventions and institutions, with particular emphasis on the CBD. #To enhance the capacity to predict the consequences of current actions affecting biodiversity, drawing on the sciences of both natural and social systems. #To provide, proactively, scientific advice on emerging threats and issues associated with biodiversity change identified either by science, and to be responsive to concerns about potential threats expressed by stakeholders. #To communicate scientific results on biodiversity to wider relevant audiences. #To provide scientific support to existing biodiversity and related monitoring and assessment exercises, and potentially to supplement these as necessary. # To reduce the time lag between the publication of scientific results on biodiversity and their incorporation in decision-processes. #To inform science and science funding agencies about biodiversity research priorities implied by decision-makers' concerns. Options formulated by the EC as basis for discussion #To form a partnership with existing mechanisms for delivering science to national and international decision-making bodies.

In 2019, an estimated 19 million people read the books which Book Aid International provided.https://bookaid.org/aboutus/how-books-change-lives/  History  Book Aid International was founded in 1954 by The Rt Hon. Hermione, Countess of Ranfurly, after she moved to the Bahamas with her husband, The 6th Earl of Ranfurly, an Ulster-Scots nobleman who was Governor of the Bahamas. Upon touring the islands, Lady Ranfurly was shocked at the lack of reading materials available. In response, Lady Ranfurly founded the Ranfurly Out Island Library service to provide books in the Bahamas. Over the years, she expanded her work throughout the Commonwealth of Nations and set up an organisation called The Ranfurly Library Service in London. In 1994, the Ranfurly Library Service changed its name to Book Aid International. In 1966, His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh became the charity‚Äôs patron, and his patronage still continues today despite His Royal Highness‚Äô April 2017 retirement from public service. In 2007 the Department for International Development ended its funding agreement with Book Aid International, requiring them to reduce in staff and countries they work in.

It is popularly associated with the reluctant embrace in a time of financial crisis of Keynesian economics by individuals such as Nixon who had formerly favored less interventionist policies.  History of the phrase and variations  Carl Turner in his 1969 bookCarl B. Turner (1969) An analysis of Soviet views on John Maynard Keynes, Duke Univ Press, p52 cites a Russian article by I.G. Blyumin from 1947, referring to what was already the 'famous remark'. The phrase was later attributed to Milton Friedman in the December 31, 1965, edition of Time magazine. In the February 4, 1966, edition, Friedman wrote a letter clarifying that his original statement had been \\"In one sense, we are all Keynesians now; in another, nobody is any longer a Keynesian.\\" Friedman's expression was purportedly a rejoinder to the 1888 claim of British politician William Vernon Harcourt that \\"We are all socialists now\\"; a declaration that was reprinted for a Newsweek magazine cover story in 2009. In 1971, after taking the United States off the Bretton Woods system, Nixon was quoted as saying, \\"I am now a Keynesian in economics\\",The New York Times, January 4, 1971 which became popularly associated with Friedman's phrase. In 2002, Peter Mandelson wrote an article in The Times declaring \\"we are all Thatcherites now\\", referring to the acceptance among the other political parties of Margaret Thatcher's economic policies. The phrase gained new life in the midst of the global financial crisis of 2008, when economists called for massive investment in infrastructure and job creation as a means of economic stimulation.

Nauvoo Village, 4. Fort Madison, 5. village near Rocheport, 6. Saint Louis, 7. burial site opposite Clarksville. Quashquame (alt: \\"Quawsquawma, Quashquami, Quashquammee, Quash-Qua-Mie, Quash-kaume, Quash-quam-ma\\", meaning \\"Jumping Fish\\") (c. 1764 ‚Äì c . 1832) was a Sauk chief; he was the principal signer of the 1804 treaty that ceded Sauk land to the United States government. He maintained two large villages of Sauk and Meskwaki in the early 19th century near the modern towns of Nauvoo, Illinois and Montrose, Iowa, and a village or camp in Cooper County, Missouri. 1804 Treaty of St. Louis Quashquame is best known as the leader of the 1804 delegation to St. Louis that ceded lands in western Illinois and northeast Missouri to the U.S. government under the supervision of William Henry Harrison. This treaty was disputed, as the Sauk argued the delegation was not authorized to sign treaties and the delegates did not understand what they were signing. Black Hawk, a frequent visitor to Quashquame's village, lamented this treaty in his autobiography.Black Hawk 1882 The Sauk and Meskwaki delegation had been sent to surrender a murder suspect and make amends for the killing, not to conduct land treaties. The treaty was a primary cause of Sauk displeasure with the U.S. government and caused many Sauk, including Black Hawk, to side with the British during the War of 1812.Channick 1998 Fort Madison and the War of 1812 Zebulon Pike noted rumors that Quashquame was leading a large group of 500 Sauk, Meskwaki, and Ioway near the Missouri River west of St. Louis in 1806.July 17, 1806 journal entry, The Expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike. ed. Elliot Coues, Vol. 2, (1895) Harper, New York This village might have been at Moniteau Creek in the south part of Cooper County, Missouri, where he was later known to have a temporary village.Johnson (1919:63) Quashuame was back along the Mississippi by 1809, Quashquame attended several meetings with the U.S. Army at Fort Madison during the turbulent period leading up to the War of 1812. Quashquame and his band of Sauk remained neutral during the war.Fulton 1882 In the Spring of 1809 several Sauk, possibly led by Black Hawk, attempted to storm Fort Madison. They were held at bay by threat of cannon fire. The next day Quashquame and two other Sauk leaders attempted to restore relations with the United States Army, telling the commander, Alpha Kingsley, that the offending parties were acting on their own and had left the region. Kingsley demonstrated the might of the Army, firing a canister of shot from a six-pounder cannon. The Sauk were astonished and \\"put their hands to their mouths with an exclamation that that shot would have killed half of them.\\"Van der Zee (1913:524-525) Quashquamie attempted to placate Gen. William Clark during a meeting in 1810 or 1811 in St. Louis, telling Clark, \\"My father, I left my home to see my great- grandfather, the president of the United States, but as I cannot proceed to see him, I give you my hand as to himself. I have no father to whom I have paid any attention but yourself. If you hear anything, I hope that you will let me know, and I will do the same. I have been advised several times to raise the tomahawk. Since the last war we have looked upon the Americans as friends, and I shall hold you fast by the hand. The Great Spirit has not put us on the earth to war with the whites. We have never struck a white man. If we go to war it is with the red flesh. Other nations send belts among us, and urge us to war. They say that if we do not, the Americans will encroach upon us, and drive us off our lands.\\" Johnson (1919:62) About 1810, Quashquamie maintained a camp or temporary village along Moniteau Creek in the south part of Cooper County, Missouri, perhaps near Rocheport. Quashquame was left in charge of the non-warrior members of the Sauk during the War of 1812. Black Hawk wrote: \\"... all the children and old men and women belonging to the warriors who had joined the British were left with them to provide for. A council had been called which agreed that Quashquame, the Lance, and other chiefs, with the old men, women and children, and such others as chose to accompany them, should descend the Mississippi to St. Louis, and place themselves under the American chief stationed there. They accordingly went down to St. Louis, were received as the friendly band of our nation, were sent up the Missouri and provided for, while their friends were assisting the British!\\"Black Hawk (1882) Later Treaties Quashquame was a Sauk representative on a number of treaties after the war. In 1815 Quashquame was part of a large delegation that signed a treaty confirming a split between the Sauk along the Missouri River with the Sauk that lived along the Rock River at Saukenuk.Indian Treaties 1795 to 1862 Vol. XX - Sauk & Fox L.S. Watson (ed.) 1993 The Rock River group of Sauk was commonly known as the British Band, which formed the core of Indians participating in the Black Hawk War. Among other treaties, in 1825 Quashquame signed the First Treaty of Prairie du Chien, which established boundaries between rival tribes. Villages Quashquame maintained a village near what is now Nauvoo, Illinois until it was combined with an older village on the west side of the Mississippi near Montrose, Iowa. While living at the eastern village, Quashquame helped mediate retribution for the murder of a Sauk by a white trader near Bear Creek in 1818.Thomas Forsyth, Journal of a Voyage From St. Louis to the Falls of St. Anthony, in 1819. Collections of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin (1908) Vol. 6 About 1824 Captain James White purchased the eastern village from Quashquame. White gave Quashquame \\"a little sku-ti-apo [liquor] and two thousand bushels of corn\\" for the land. Quashquame's village moved to the west bank of the river, merging with an existing Sauk village near what is now Montrose, Iowa.Whittaker 2008 This western village was also called Cut Nose's Village, Wapello's Village, or the Lowest Sauk Village, and was located at the head of the Des Moines Rapids, a strategic bottleneck in Mississippi trade. Historical accounts suggest the village was occupied from the 1780s until the 1840s. This village was visited by Zebulon Pike in 1805Pike 1966 and in 1829 by Caleb Atwater.Atwater 1831 Atwater interview of 1829 Caleb Atwater visited Quashquame in 1829, Atwater's interview provided the most detailed description of Quashquame and his village near Montrose, and revealed that Quashquame was a skilled artist: Personal Atwater estimated Quashquame's age to be about 65, which means he may have been born about 1764. Quashquame was the father-in-law of famed Meskwaki chief Taimah (Tama). Because of his role in the disputed 1804 treaty, Quashquame was reduced from a principal leader of the Sauk to a minor chief. \\"Quasquawma, was chief of this tribe once, but being cheated out of the mineral country, as the Indians allege, he was denigrated from his rank and his son-in-law Tiama elected in his stead.\\" Fulton provided this epitaph: \\"Qashquame died opposite Clarksville, Missouri, about the beginning of 1830. In person he was short, but heavily formed. He was not considered great intellectually, and was regarded as deficient in the traits of a noble warrior. His influence among his people was limited, and his character not free from tarnish. Black Hawk did not hesitate to censure him in the most bitter terms for the part he took in the treaty of 1804.\\"Fulton 1882, p. 274-275 The 1830 date of death is not supported by historical accounts of Quashquame attending a conference at Fort Armstrong in the fall of 1831.Trask, Kerry (2006) Black Hawk:The Battle for the Heart of America. Henry Holt. p.120 An alternative account from the 1870s is that he died and was buried near Davenport, Iowa.

The trains were worked by the GNR. The Ramsey Railway was acquired by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) in 1875, who planned to link it to another line that had been authorised in 1865 to run from to Ramsey. Although the latter was eventually built, opening in 1889, the two lines were never connected, and the Somersham line terminated at a different station, latterly known as . The branch from Holme remained physically isolated from the rest of the GER system, and so the GER leased it to the GNR which continued to work it. On 1 January 1923 the GNR and the GER became constituents of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), which found itself with two stations in Ramsey; they were given new names on 1 July 1923, the ex-Ramsey Railway station becoming Ramsey North.

Its task is to evaluate and decide on applications from people who want to seek a temporary residence permit, acquire permanent residence or citizenship in Sweden. This makes it involved in immigration to Sweden The Swedish Migration Agency is under the Ministry of Justice and operates nationwide from about 40 offices. It is headquartered in Norrk√∂ping in √ñsterg√∂tland and is led by a Director General, currently Anders Danielsson. In 2014, the agency received 81,301 applications for asylum, of which 31,220 were granted. In 2017 according to calculations done by weekly magazine Fokus, the agency's budget for unaccompanied minors alone at 27 billion krona represented 37% of the UNHCR:s budget for managing refugees over the entire planet.  Criticism  The Swedish Migration Agency has come under criticism for its opaque handling of expatriate work permit applications and inordinate delays coupled with over-zealous, often controversial, readings of Swedish regulations related to insurance requisites for work permit extensions. The Agency continues to process applications with delays extending up to 10 months in some cases. In May 2016 the Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine sv: R√§ttsmedicinalverket (RMV) started aiding the agency with determining the age of migrants claiming to be under 18. The first batch of 518 investigations indicated that 442 were likely adult and the rest retained their status as unaccompanied minors, which gave access to education, better housing and greater likelihood of refugee status. Of the 442, 430 were men and 12 women. RMV was tasked with doing the backlog of 3000 - 14000 age investigations which had been obstructed by Swedish Bar Association lawyers, doctors, dentists and officials of National Board of Health and Welfare. In June 2016 the SMA expressed doubts about 70% of asylum applicants purportedly 15-17. Up until 2017, this agency awarded temporary residence permits also to people considered war criminals and security threats. This allowed these individuals to claim welfare benefits and healthcare from the state of Sweden. In September 2017 staff at the agency reported rising levels of death threats and harassment from migrants applying for residence permits. The nature of the threats changed with staff members being sought out at their homes or receiving threatening messages on private phones or in social media. In July 2018, the agency together with municipalities of Sweden was criticised by the national agency against honor-related crime (Swedish: nationella kompetensteamet mot hedersrelaterat v√•ld och f√∂rtryck) for not doing enough to discover and rectify child marriages among migrants.

SynopsisThe Long Hair in the Attic= Chiemi and her boyfriend break up, with her boyfriend explaining that while she tried to look her best for him, the relationship still wasn't satisfying enough. When Chiemi returns home, depressed by her loss, she is greeted by her sister, Eri, who tells her that she thinks the attic is infested with mice. That night, Chiemi burns a photograph of her ex, and remembers when he suggested she grow out her hair for him, the thought causing her to cry herself to sleep. The next morning, Chiemi finds a dead mouse tangled in her long hair, and resolves to cut it and move on. While Eri goes to find scissors to give to her sister, she and her mother hear Chiemi screaming. Both rush to her room, only to find Chiemi decapitated, her head missing. The police are called, but no leads can be found. A week later, Chiemi's ex is awoken by a phone call, but no noise comes from the other end of the line. He then hears the sound of grinding teeth. Believing himself responsible for Chiemi's death, and reasoning that it could have been a suicide, he is beset by remorse, and then receives a second phone call, much like the first. A few days later, Eri asks her father for a flashlight so she can check the attic for mice, but he insists that he goes to check himself, much to Eri's warnings about his heart condition. After some time passes, Eri notices that her father wasn't answering her calls, and climbs up into the attic to investigate. There, she finds her father slumped against the wall, dead from a heart attack induced by fright. When she looks up, she finds Chiemi's head, suspended from the rafters by its extremely long hair. Eri tries to take the head down, only for it to use its hair to open its eyes, and begins gnashing its teeth, to which Eri realises the hair had come alive, and had killed Chiemi to prevent her from cutting it. The head then unhooks itself from the rafters, and slithers away to the house of Chiemi's ex, where it torments him by attempting to force its hair through cracks in the walls. =Approval= Kyosuke and Misuzu are two young adults very much in love with each other, who want to get married. However, a single obstacle to the marriage lies in the form of Misuzu's father, who flatly refuses Kyosuke's requests, and is joined by Misuzu's brother, Setsuo, in his disapproval of the idea. Frustrated by constantly being rejected, Kyosuke breaks off the relationship. At work, Kyosuke begins to fall for one of his colleagues, a woman named Yuko, who is sympathetic to his plight. After going out to dinner, he runs into Setsuo, whose opinion has suddenly changed, learning from him that he wants Kyosuke to marry his sister. Annoyed, Kyosuke initially refuses, but Setsuo gives him a bottle of his father's favourite drink to offer as a gift, and convinces him to try anyway. Later that night, Misuzu takes Kyosuke home to her father. There, she reveals that even though it's been a month since they broke up, she still loves him, and asks if he had been seeing anyone else, which Kyosuke denies. Unbeknown to both of them, Setsuo is spying on the young couple. Despite this show of affection, Misuzu's father still disapproves of the relationship. Some time later, Yuko and Kyosuke are spending dinner at his house, when Misuzu suddenly arrives, wanting to take Kyosuke home again, to which he follows her to a cab. There, Misuzu asks him if Yuko is his new girlfriend, and Kyosuke confirms it. The following morning, Yuko doesn't arrive at work, and has fallen deathly ill. Kyosuke goes to visit her at the hospital, but is too late, and Yuko dies suddenly. In the evening, Misuzu pays another visit, and the two mourn Yuko, crying for the entire night. Thirteen years pass, and Misuzu's father is just as stubborn as ever. One day, Kyosuke decides to directly challenge him, explaining that he will continue pushing for his approval for the marriage no matter what. When he heads to return home with Misuzu in tow, he realises that he left his bag in the house, and goes to retrieve it, overhearing Misuzu's father and Setsuo talking. Misuzu's father tells Setsuo that he is angry Kyosuke \\"took her away\\" from him, and that he still refuses to give Kyosuke what he wants. Exasperated, Kyosuke continues to ask for approval, and eventually formulates a plan to kill Misuzu's father. Some time later, Kyosuke poisons Misuzu's father's drink and waits for him to become ill. Sickened by the poison, Misuzu's father is admitted to hospital, where, beset by his decline, he finally tells Kyosuke why he refuses to let him marry Misuzu. Thirteen years previously, on the day Kyosuke and Misuzu broke up, Misuzu confided in her father that she still had feelings for Kyosuke, and that her love was real, but he still refused to let his daughter marry him. In response, Misuzu committed suicide. After noticing that both he and Setsuo could see Misuzu's spirit, her father began to use the situation as a way to reconcile with the grief and guilt from his loss, as the spirit of his daughter would remain close for as long as he continued to refuse the marriage. After he finishes explaining the reasons for his refusal, Misuzu's father abruptly dies, leaving Kyosuke alone. Kyosuke turns around to find that Misuzu, who had been attending to her father, is now missing. After returning home, wallowing in sorrow and remorse, he finds that his house is now haunted by Misuzu's ghost, who visits him every night to tell him that the marriage has been approved. =Beehive= Takano, an amateur entomologist, and his friend, Yoriko, are out for a walk. As the two walk together, Yoriko remarks that Takano hadn't collected any beehives lately, and Takano replies that he hadn't had the time lately to engage in his hobby. While embracing Yoriko, Takano notices a wasp nearby and follows it to locate its hive, though he stops when he notices the insect heading into the woods. Yoriko asks him what's wrong, but Takano tries to change the subject, then Yoriko asks him if he's afraid of the ghost which supposedly inhabits the woods, to which Takano feigns not knowing about. Yoriko then mentions that a strange boy who lived in the neighbourhood has been missing for quite some time. Takano has a flashback to an event in which a colony of wasps built their nest on the side of Yoriko's house. Their neighbour tells them about a boy who can remove hives and nests by hand, without getting stung, when Takano arrives, and asks if he can take the hive. After being given permission, he says that he will return in the evening, when the insects are less active, but before he can return to do so, the boy mentioned by the neighbour visits Yoriko. Although Yoriko tells the boy that Takano will handle the nest, he explains that he will take it instead, and that the neighbourhood was once a forest, so the wasps are making nests where they can. After the boy takes the nest, Takano arrives, and protests that the nest belongs to him. The boy refuses, saying that the wasps are his friends, and he wants to protect them. When Takano attempts to grab the boy by the shoulder, the wasps emerge from the nest and attack him, though Yoriko intervenes. After asking to be friends, Takano runs off. Later, Yoriko meets Takano again, who is busy luring a bee with tuna. The two then follow the bee to a cave, where they hear a loud buzzing noise, and encounter the boy again, feeding colonies of bees and wasps with meat from a dead frog. Takano wonders how the insects can get along, and why so many hives are in the cave, but soon leaves. Back in the present, Yoriko looks over Takano's collected hives, but then begins talking about the boy again, and that she thinks he was murdered. That night, Takano returns to the cave. On the day he found it, he had murdered the boy by strangling him, then buried his body in a shallow grave inside the cave. After taking a shovel to the ground, he discovers a hive, but is startled by two men walking through the woods, and hurriedly digs it up. When he returns home, he finds blood on his hands. The next day, Yoriko tells Takano that the body of the boy was found by hunters, and that it had been decapitated, and that the men saw someone run away with the head. Nervously, Takano sees Yoriko off, and goes to his room, where he finds the hive dripping with blood. He cracks it open to find the boy's head, and learns that he had failed to kill him the first time; injured by the murder attempt, the boy had commanded his insects to build a hive around his head, where they had been attending to him until the moment Takano decapitated him with the shovel. Suddenly, hornets fill the room and begin to attack Takano, eventually paralysing and killing him with their venom. Once Takano is dead, they begin ripping flesh from his body and moulding it to the hive, intending to rebuild the boy's body and revive him. =Dying Young= Ayako is a slightly ugly student, who is friends with her classmate Chizuru. One day, Chizuru suddenly becomes extremely beautiful, becoming popular at school, only to drop dead of a sudden heart attack. Everyone wonders what could have caused this, including another of Ayako's friends, Hiroko, who asks Ayako after the funeral if she thinks she will become pretty as well. Ayako, disturbed by the death of Chizuru, doesn't take well to the question. Over the next few days, Hiroko begins to change in appearance as well, and joins a clique of attractive students, leaving Ayako behind. Hiroko makes an off-hand comment that Ayako should become pretty like her, but Ayako becomes concerned about Hiroko's condition. Soon enough, several of the girls in Ayako's class are becoming beautiful, but appear to be anemic as well. Those whose appearance hasn't changed yet touch Hiroko, hoping to 'catch' her beauty as if it were contagious, and eventually it turns out that this appears to be the case. As the number of girls afflicted with whatever makes them beautiful begins to increase, Ayako - her appearance still the same - only becomes more concerned about Hiroko. While walking with a boyfriend, Hiroko encounters her sister, Kaori, who has also become beautiful. Kaori tells Hiroko that she doesn't feel well, and suddenly falls dead on the spot. Panic spreads throughout the school, as the students believe a disease that makes you beautiful before you die could be spreading. Hiroko becomes bitter and cynical, and one day tells Ayako of a rumour going around that if someone afflicted with the disease kills an ugly girl on the third Friday of the month, they might be saved. Ayako is scared by Hiroko's willingness to believe the rumour, but rationalises that Hiroko wouldn't want to kill anyone. As time goes by, more girls die, and no explanation is found. An alternate theory emerges that the spate of deaths may be the result of the impending 21st century, but the theory of it being an epidemic still persists. Ayako's friends stop coming to school, including Hiroko. One night, Ayako hears noises outside her house. She goes to investigate, only to find Hiroko and her friends following an ugly girl, intending to stab her to death. Ayako manages to distract Hiroko's group for long enough for the girl to escape, but the effort is in vain, and the student is murdered by another beautiful girl lying in wait. Angry at Ayako for stopping her, Hiroko turns to attack Ayako, but dies before she can reach her, her head falling in Ayako's lap. =Headless Sculptures= Students Shimada and Rumi belong to the Art club at their school, learning under the guidance of Mr. Okabe, a sculptor who is soon to have his sculptures - a set of headless statues - featured in an exhibition. Shimada and Rumi regularly stay after school to help Okabe work on his statues, but one afternoon Rumi heads home early, annoyed after Shimada makes an off-hand joke about her possibly being a model for one of Okabe's works. The next day, Rumi goes to Shimada's house to walk to school with him, but he replies that he feels unwell. When Rumi arrives at school, she learns that Okabe is dead, having been decapitated around midnight, just like his statues. Rumi, aware that Shimada could be considered a suspect in the murder case as he stayed into the night to work with Okabe, covers for him. Shimada returns to school a few days later, clad in his winter uniform and a surgical mask, and denies having anything to do with Okabe's murder. At the end of the day, two students, Masami and Sanae, head to the art block to retrieve Sanae‚Äôs books. Cautiously, they enter the classroom, noticing that the floor is covered in mats to hide bloodstains. Before they can leave, the two girls hear a strange sound, and hide under a table. Suddenly, a seemingly-reanimated Okabe appears, his face frozen in a terrifying expression and mouth agape, and attacks them. Shimada takes Rumi for a walk, where he tells her that Okabe is still alive, and was merely hiding in the art block to avoid attracting attention. Her attention piqued, Rumi asks Shimada who Okabe's supposed body belongs to if it is not him, and Shimada offers to show her. The two walk to the art block, then to the classroom. All of Okabe's statues are missing bar one, though the empty stands of the missing statues remain. Rumi notes that the air smells of something rotting. Suddenly, Shimada locks the door to the classroom, and removes his mask, revealing that he is bleeding profusely from the mouth. Ignoring Rumi's concerns, Shimada removes the cover from the remaining statue, revealing it to have Okabe's head attached to it, and that he intends to replace the head with that of Rumi, removing Okabe‚Äôs head from the artwork. Shimada pursues Rumi, only to lose his head when Rumi slaps him, revealing that he is one of the other statues, which had suddenly come to life. Rumi fights off the statue with a chair, causing it to trip and shatter into pieces, only for the statue that formerly held Okabe's head to give chase with a meat cleaver, angered that Rumi had killed ‚Äòher fianc√©‚Äô and demanding that she give it her head. Additional statues appear, and join the chase through the art block. Rumi continues to attempt to escape, entering a room on the upper floor, but then encounters the headless bodies of Shimada, Masami and Sanae. A group of statues in the room fight over the heads of the two students, with the statues who end up with the heads being able to see Rumi. They remark on her beauty, and want her head to replace one of theirs. Rumi looks on in horror as the female statue that once held Okabe‚Äôs head forces its arm through the window on the door, and all the statues proceed to swarm Rumi and grab at her head. =Flesh-Colored Horror= Momoko Takigawa, a kindergarten teacher, is on her way home one night when an unseen person douses her in a substance which hardens like glue. Though she manages to make it home, she has to cut her hair and dispose of her outfit after the chemical ruins both. One of her students, Chikara Kawabe, is cruel to the other children, and appears to be ill; he has no hair, very pale skin and sunken eyes, his appearance alone able to make the people around him uneasy. In class, he tears up displays on the walls, but when Takigawa stops him, he insists that he was only 'peeling' the work off the wall, and threatens the class with doing the same to their faces. On the way home, Takigawa meets Chikara's mother, who doesn't have much to explain for Chikara's behaviour, talking about him as if he wasn't her child, and simply claiming he was lonely. Ms. Kawabe invites Takigawa home to discuss Chikara's behaviour in more detail, where she reveals that she is actually Chikara's aunt, Maya. His mother spends much of her time at home, and appears pale and gaunt. The entire house is covered in torn wallpaper, a result of Chikara's obsession with peeling things. Takigawa feels uncertain about what she sees, but notes that Chikara's mother appears to love the boy very much. The next day, Chikara attempts to rip the skin off the face of one of his classmates and is finally expelled, though for days afterwards he appears at the windows of the school, glaring at the students, and eventually follows Takigawa to her apartment, where her father who was visiting at the time has an opportunity to examine his skin. A trained doctor, Takigawa's father notes that Chikara's skin is thinning, and that his fingerprints are missing, and recommends that the boy be seen by a specialist. Takigawa takes a protesting Chikara home to his mother, who dismisses the severity of Chikara's condition, in spite of Takigawa's concerns. After Takigawa leaves, Chikara's mother and Maya prepare a strange chemical mixture on the stove, which they then apply to Chikara's whole body. After the chemical sets, they rip it off, much to the child's cries of pain, but his appearance hasn't changed, leading his mother to exclaim 'we failed again'. Though Maya suggests they stop trying the treatment on Chikara, his mother refuses, and rips at the wallpaper in frustration, saying that she wants to 'show him his true beauty', and that she wants to see it too. Takigawa's father returns home, though as she sees him off, she notices a woman be doused in the same substance she was a few days earlier, and gives chase. When she catches up to the assailant, she finds that Maya was behind the incident, who despondently explains that the mixture was a 'beauty medicine' according to her sister, and that it was developed by her late husband, Chikara's father. Obsessed with her idea of beauty, Chikara's mother began applying it to herself, and eventually began using it on Chikara as well; as a subtle form of protest, Maya had changed the formula of the medicine to make it useless, though it still damaged the boy's skin, so she began disposing of the medicine by throwing it at strangers instead. A nearby man notices Chikara's mother, clad in a cloak and wide-brimmed hat, her body hidden in shadow. When she asks him if she is beautiful, and opens the cloak, he runs away screaming. Maya attempts to convince Takigawa to forget everything she had been told, but before Takigawa could react, Chikara's mother emerges with a rock and knocks her unconscious, then abducts her, taking Takigawa to her home. There, she elaborates on her late husband's endeavours. A modern-day alchemist, Chikara's father attempted to create a medicine that would act as an elixir of life after being applied to the skin, and tested it on himself. An hour later, he experienced a transformation, only to die of shock after seeing the result. Far from being shocked, Chikara's mother was entranced by the beauty in her husband's transformed body, and obsessed with the appearance of it, attempted to replicate the effect on herself and her son. Takigawa awakens to find Chikara's mother about to test the medicine on her, holding a bottle of acid, a main ingredient in the medicine. After she accidentally spills the acid on her leg, in a panic she urges Maya to 'get it off'. Maya pulls a zipper on her sister's body, releasing her skin from her muscles and organs underneath. As Maya washes the acid off the skin suit, Chikara's mother explains that this was the end result of the medicine her husband had created; a separator of the skin. Believing this to be the true vision of beauty, she keeps her skin in a tank of saline solution to prevent it from dying, protecting her from dying of dehydration without her skin. Suddenly, Chikara's mother noticed the bottle of liquid she spilled on her skin wasn't acid at all, but just water. Enraged, she turns to Maya, and demands she tell her where the bottle of acid is. As her sister exclaims that her son has the right to see his muscles in the same way as his mother, Maya insists that she cannot tell her where it is. Chikara appears, carrying the bottle, but rather than give it to his mother, he opens it, then kicks over the saline tank holding her skin suit, destroying it with the acid. Horrified, she turns to Maya, and demands to use her skin now that her own is destroyed, ripping hers off her head and upper body in the process. In a bid to protect his aunt, Chikara attacks his mother, ripping her calf muscles apart and forcing her to fall to the ground, now doomed to die of dehydration. Maya, terrified of the possibility of dying without a significant amount of her skin, turns to face Takigawa, and admits that she had used the medicine three years ago. Though at the time Maya believed that she wanted to use it, she had been deceived by her sister, having been manipulated into taking the medicine under the guise that it would make her look beautiful. Horrified by the scene, Takigawa faints. Reception The manga has an overall staff rating on manga-news.com of 13 out of 20.

Composed of gay men and their friends, the chorus aims to promote community spirit and a positive image of the gay community. The Chorus is a member of the Vancouver Cultural Alliance, the British Columbia Choral Federation and of GALA Choruses, an association of over one hundred men's, women's, and mixed choruses from the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia, dedicated to providing leadership and inspiration to the gay and lesbian movement through excellence in the choral arts. VMC History In 1981, the first gay choir, the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus, toured the United States and several men from Vancouver drove the three hours south to Seattle to hear them. On their return, they decided to start a chorus of their own performing their first concert in December of that same year. They officially became the first gay chorus in Canada, a founding member of GALA and the first international gay chorus in that organization. Under the continuing direction of conductor Willi Zwozdesky, the chorus has achieved national prominence through performances across Canada including visits to Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, Victoria, and Montreal, and through radio broadcasts on CBC. Concert performances in the United States have included San Francisco, Minneapolis, Seattle, Portland, Washington, D.C., Denver, San Diego, and San Jose. In addition, broadcasts of its 1995 recording Making Spirits Bright, the 1992 recording Signature and the 2006 release of Encore have increased national exposure. In 1991, The Canada Council recognized the chorus for its artistry, and in 1994, the chorus was selected as one of five national finalists in the CBC Amateur Choir Competition. In addition to its mainstage concerts that year, the chorus recorded J. Douglas Dodd's Symphony of Sound and Light with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, Elektra Women's Choir, and the Vancouver Children's Choir for broadcast on Parliament Hill during the summer months. At the core of the Chorus‚Äô achievements stands its contribution to the creation of new repertoire for men's and mixed voices. Custom-made arrangements, notably by Willi Zwozdesky, Stephen Smith, and other Canadian arrangers are a hallmark of VMC programming. As a result of this and the Chorus' wide-ranging concertizing, VMC arrangements are now heard in concert halls around the world. Original commissions have included Vancouver composers Michael Conway Baker, Ramona Luengen, Anita Perry, Rupert Lang, Stephen Smith, and Willi Zwozdesky, and Toronto composer Eleanor Daley. In 2000, the Chorus was also among the original commissioning choruses of Alan Shorter's setting of the children's story Oliver Button is a Sissy. The Chorus is a member of the British Columbia Choral Federation and of GALA Choruses (an association of over one hundred men's, women's, and mixed choruses from the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia, dedicated to providing leadership and inspiration to the gay and lesbian movement through excellence in the choral arts).

He played in the Football League as a defender for Bury, Lincoln City and Cambridge United making a total of 254 appearances, scoring four goals. Playing career Bimson began his career with spells with Prescot Cables and Ellesmere Port & Neston. In January 1989, he joined Southport debuting in the 1‚Äì0 away victory over Morecambe on 21 January 1989. A virtual ever-present during his time at Haig Avenue, he scored just one league goal for the club in the 2‚Äì1 home victory over Horwich RMI on 28 August 1989 before departing at the end of the 1990‚Äì1991 season; his final game being the 2‚Äì0 away defeat to Stalybridge Celtic on 4 May 1991. Bimson moved into the Football Conference joining Macclesfield Town at the start of the 1991‚Äì1992 season. In August 2005, Bimson agreed a 12-month contract to return to the Football Conference with Canvey Island, debuting in the 1‚Äì0 away defeat to Accrington Stanley on 13 August 2005. Following Canvey's voluntary resignation from the Football Conference at the end of the 2005‚Äì2006 season, Bimson followed Canvey's manager Jeff King to Chelmsford City. He made his debut in the 2‚Äì2 home draw with Leyton on 4 September 2006 with his second, and final game, for the club coming in the 2‚Äì1 defeat at Horsham five days later. Bimson moved on to join Bedford Town debuting in the 2‚Äì0 home defeat to Lewes on 2 December 2006. On 16 February 2006, following the departure of manager Nick Platnauer, Bimson was handed the manager's role until the end of the season. Coaching career He had a chastening start to his managerial career, suffering a 5‚Äì1 away defeat to Lewes followed by a 4-0 thumping at Havant & Waterlooville but secured a 3‚Äì1 victory over Thurrock in the next game, his first home match as manager. Although Bedford would finish the season bottom of the Conference South and secure just three victories and three draws in Bimson's 15 games in charge, they finished the season with two victories and two draws in their final four games and this upturn in form saw Bimson handed the manager's post on a permanent basis. Bimson's first full season in charge saw the Eagles suffer a second relegation as they finished 19th in the Southern Football League Premier Division; the club would later escape relegation following the demise of Nuneaton Borough. Bimson, however, was spared the sack and tasked with rebuilding the side. However, in July, he resigned his post to join Cambridge United as first team coach linking up with his long-term friend Gary Brabin who had been newly appointed as manager of the Us. However, budgetary constraints saw Bimson leave his post at the end of his one-year contract. Still eager to return to management, he applied to become the manager of former club Lincoln City in the wake of Peter Jackson's sacking in September 2009 but was not interviewed for the post. He acted as a scout for Barrow during the 2009‚Äì2010 season and from September 2010 he worked as acting assistant manager to Ken McKenna at Altrincham, their first game being the 5-0 Football Conference defeat at Eastbourne Borough on 18 September 2010. After four weeks in the acting capacity he became assistant manager on 14 October 2010 but left at the end of the season following the club's relegation from the Football Conference. In July 2012, he joined the youth set-up at Southend United, becoming Centre of Excellence Development Coach. ReferencesExternal links * *Lincoln City F.C.

It is owned and operated by the State Historic Preservation Office of Connecticut. The property includes the Kent Iron Furnace, a granite blast furnace which produced pig iron for almost 70 years, beginning in 1826. The furnace is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Museum The Eric Sloane Museum is located north of Kent village, on the west side of United States Route 7. Its grounds are separated from the road by the tracks of the Housatonic Railroad; a crossing facilitates access to its grounds, and those of the adjacent Connecticut Antique Machinery Association. The museum houses a collection of antique hand tools collected over many years by Eric Sloane. The museum building, which served as Sloane's art studio, was given to the state in 1969 by the Stanley Works tool manufacturer. It also has displays related to the industrial uses of the site in the 19th century. Iron furnace left The iron furnace is located down the hill from the museum, on a rise overlooking the Housatonic River to the west. It is a stone structure in height, with sides that are at the base, sloping inward as the structure rise. Three of its faces have pointed-arch openings, two smaller ones on opposite sides. The structure is built out of rough cut granite blocks randomly laid without mortar, with iron plates and tie rods added to prevent expansion-related problems. and The history of iron processing at this site began in 1826, with the construction of a cold blast furnace. Iron ore was brought to the site from a quarry in South Kent, and the processed iron was mainly used in the construction of railroads. That furnace was rebuilt as a hot blast furnace in 1846, and was enlarged to its present size in 1870. The facility was operated until 1892. During its operational period, it would have been surrounded by wooden structures designed to facilitate operations and shelter the main structure. These were typically temporary in nature, due to the risk of fire and the frequent need for reconfiguration.

It is one of many related species commonly known as black morels, and until 2012 the name M. elata was broadly applied to black morels throughout the globe. Like most members of the genus, M. elata is a popular edible fungus and is sought by many mushroom hunters. Taxonomy and phylogeny The fruit bodies of Morchella species, including M. elata, are highly polymorphic in appearance, exhibiting variations in shape, color and size; this has contributed to uncertainties regarding taxonomy. Discriminating between the various species is complicated by uncertainty regarding which species are truly biologically distinct. Mushroom hunters refer to them by their color as the species are very similar in appearance and vary considerably within species and age of individual. Early phylogenetic analyses supported the hypothesis that the genus comprises only a few species with considerable phenotypic variation. More recent DNA work, however, has revealed more than a dozen distinct groups of morels in North America, and over 60 worldwide. An extensive DNA study showed three discrete clades, or genetic groups, consisting of the black morels (Morchella elata and others), the yellow morels (Morchella esculenta and others), and the white morels (Morchella rufobrunnea and Morchella anatolica). Species within the Elata clade (also referred to as Distantes), are characterised by the gradual darkening of their sterile ridges upon maturity, with the exception of Morchella tridentina (=Morchella frustrata), which has persistently pale ridges. Within the black and yellow clades, there are dozens of individual species, many endemic to individual continents or regions. This species-rich view is supported by studies in North America, Western Europe, Turkey, Israel, the Himalayas, and China. The scientific name Morchella elata was proposed by Elias Magnus Fries from Europe in 1822. DNA analysis in 2011 has shown North American black morels to be largely distinct from European species, therefore restricting the use of the M. elata name to Europe. In 2012, Kuo et al. provided names for many of the North American black morels that may have been referred to as M. elata in the past. However, in a subsequent study by Richard et al. (2014) proposing a unified taxonomy for the genus, it is suggested that Fries' original description of Morchella elata may correspond to phylogenetic lineage Mel-10, which has been since described from North America as Morchella importuna, but later shown to have a widespread transcontinental distribution. The variety M. elata var. purpurescens, characterised by the purple- or pink-colored tinges of its ascocarps, is now considered to belong to a phylogenetically distinct lineage (Richard et al. 2014). Eastern North America * M. angusticeps * M. septentrionalis Western North America * M. brunnea * M. capitata * M. importuna * M. septimelata * M. sextelata * M. snyderi * M. tomentosa Description asci viewed with phase contrast microscopy Morchella elata has operculate asci (i.e., asci opening by an apical lid to discharge the spores). It further has unicellular hyaline ascospores with polar oil droplets. Despite the fact that many interpretations of M. elata exist throughout the years, most authors agree that Fries' original concept refers to a species with dark, conical ascocarps and more or less parallel vertical ridges, with horizontal interconnecting ridges arranged in a \\"ladderlike\\" pattern.Boudier E (1897) R√©vision analytique des morilles de France.

This is an edible species, although like other morels, some individuals may be allergic to it. It must be cooked before being eaten. Ecology and distribution Morchela elata var. purpurascens, Mount Parnitha Morchella elata fruits during spring on soil. Fries' original description, which was based on a collection from a fir wood in Sweden, reported it as rare: \\"In silvis abiegnis, praecipue locis humidis adustis, raro\\". However, since the true identity of M. elata is not yet fully clarified, its exact ecological preferences and distribution remain unclear. Toxicity Morels contain small amounts of hydrazine toxins or an unknown toxin that are destroyed through cooking, (the presence of hydrazine is controversial since there are no primary references of hydrazine having been detected in the species), so morel mushrooms should never be eaten raw. It has been reported that even cooked morels can sometimes cause mild intoxication symptoms when consumed with alcohol. This mushroom should not be eaten as it causes gastrointestinal disorder and cannot easily be identified without a microscope.

In 1899, a brief biography by Meiji era historian Sekine Shisei (1868‚Äì1912) was included in a compendium of biographies. According to Sekine, Kunimasu was a moneyed property owner who studied print design under Utagawa Kunisada in EdoDoesburg dates the beginning of his apprenticeship to \\"some time between 8/1828 and 3/1830.\\" before himself mentoring several pupils and opening his own print design school.

Signed \\"eshi Utagawa Sadamasu ga\\" [ÁµµÂ∏´ Ê≠åÂ∑ù Ë≤ûÂçá Áîª], the print was almost certainly produced while he was in Edo studying under Utagawa Kunisada. Kunimasu has been described as an \\"influential\\" figure on the Osaka art scene, one of his greatest achievements being the popularization of the ch≈´banA smaller sized print, measuring approximately 18 x 25 cm. format. Kunimasu began experimenting with close-up actor portraits in this size in 1840, not long before the Tenp≈ç Reforms were to disrupt yakusha-e production. He encouraged his student and fellow pupil of Kunisada, Hirosada, to follow suit. With the repeal of the Tenp≈ç Reforms in the spring of 1847, Hirosada was to pioneer a revival of the ch≈´ban portrait format, likely through the financial support of Kunimasu.Clark 2005, 51 Critics tend to admire Kunimasu's \\"sense of colour and... fine palette dominated by intense colours with subtle contrasts,\\" as well as the \\"bold directness\\" of his lines. In addition, he is credited with employing \\"tour-de-force techniques\\" such as \\"sumptuously printed... metallic pigments, embossing, burnishing, [and] overprinting.\\" The majority of Kunimasu's works belong to the yakusha-e genre, being portraits of actors from the local kabuki theatre world. This is a common feature of artists from the Kamigata region, where the vast majority of artists were not professionals, but \\"talented kabuki fans.\\"Kitagawa 2005, 230 Kunimasu in particular is credited with \\"expressing the psychology of stage performance through powerful and varied physiognomies and vivid or unusual placements of the figures in his compositions.\\"Fiorillo In 1852, Kunimasu and his student Hirosada visited Edo, where they joined with other pupils of Kunisada in creating background designs for a series of half-length actor portraits.Keyes and Mizushima 1973, 234 Soon after returning to Kamigata, Kunimasu turned his back on ukiyo-e and took up painting.

It was first published in 1991 and became an immediate cause c√©l√®bre and bestseller. The book was reissued in 2002 after the author's death. Background In partnership with her husband Michael, Julia Phillips was one of the most successful film producers in Hollywood during the 1970s. Their second film, The Sting, grossed almost $160 million and won seven Academy Awards, making Julia the first woman to win a Best Picture Oscar. Their third film, Taxi Driver, brought them a second Oscar nomination and won the Palme d'Or in 1976. In 1977 they co-produced their most financially successful movie, Steven Spielberg's $300 million-grossing Close Encounters of the Third Kind. However, Julia had long indulged in a self-destructive lifestyle of excessive drug consumption, and it had begun to affect her work. Fran√ßois Truffaut, one of French cinema's most iconic directors and a star of Close Encounters (playing \\"Claude Lacombe\\", a French government scientist in charge of UFO-related activities in the United States), blamed her for that film's budget difficulties, and she was eventually fired during post-production because of her cocaine dependence. Phillips, by now divorced, spent the following years on a downward spiral which included, by her own account, spending $120,000 on cocaine, before entering therapy to recover from her addiction. Then, in 1988, having been out of Hollywood for eleven years, she sold all her assets to produce The Beat, about a kid in a tough neighbourhood trying to teach poetry to local gangs. It was a critical and commercial disaster, grossing less than $5,000 at the box office, and Phillips turned to penning her scathing memoir to escape her financial difficulties. Synopsis The book begins by briefly introducing the reader to Phillips in 1989, before quickly travelling back to her childhood in 1940s Brooklyn. It then covers her early life and first successes in the film industry: she and Michael earned $100,000 from their debut feature, Steelyard Blues, moved to Malibu, California, and had a daughter, Kate. The most notorious chapters follow as Phillips enjoys her greatest career successes, perhaps most infamously when she recalls the amalgam of drugs she was under the influence of on the night she won her Oscar (\\"a diet pill, a small amount of coke, two joints, six halves of Valium, and a glass and a half of wine\\"). She also reveals the personal peccadillos and vices of the biggest Hollywood A-listers of the day, including Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Richard Dreyfuss, Goldie Hawn, and David Geffen. Many of these people were pivotal figures in the emergence of New Hollywood in the 1960s and '70s, but Phillips disparagingly refers to them as \\"a rogues' gallery of nerds\\". Later episodes in her life, including freebasing, and her abusive relationship with a violent drug addict which caused her to miss her own mother's funeral, are also discussed candidly. Most significant, from Phillips' own point of view, is her expos√© of the \\"Boys' Club\\" in the higher echelons of Hollywood, where she claimed it was her gender that led to her ultimate ostracism. \\"If I had been a man, they would have closed ranks around me\\", she said, referring to her drug addiction. \\"They hated the woman thing. And I wasn't even regarded as a woman, I was a girl.\\" Writing about her in The Independent in 2002, film critic David Thomson expressed Phillips' attitude as: \\"you [Hollywood] guys don't take women seriously; you like us around... [but] we aren't allowed to be players\\". Those same few men, like \\"Valley viper\\" Mike Ovitz who headed the Creative Artists Agency were, in her eyes, responsible for a qualitative decline in standards and the increasing banality of movies since the 1970s. Reception On its release most critics agreed that the book was both scandalous and career-ending. (Even with a quarter of the 1,000-page original manuscript excised, it took lawyers at Random House fourteen months to approve it for publication.) Lewis Cole, in The Nation, described it as being \\"[not] written but spat out, a breakneck, formless performance piece...propelled by spite and vanity\\". Newsweek's review called it a \\"573-page primal scream\\", while one Hollywood producer said it was \\"the longest suicide note in history\\". In the 2003 documentary version of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, based on Peter Biskind's 1998 anecdotal history of New Hollywood, Richard Dreyfuss recalled his initial fury at Phillips' revelations, before more circumspectly listening to \\"a little voice inside my head [saying] 'Richard, Richard, the truth was so much worse'.\\" Despite Phillips' criticisms of Steven Spielberg in the book, Spielberg nevertheless invited her to a 1997 screening of Close Encounters of the Third Kind as a way of \\"keeping his friends close and his enemies closer.\\" Rapper Tupac Shakur misquotes the title of the book in a Vibe interview in 1996, stating briefly that it was one of the books he read recently. \\"You‚Äôll Never Work Again in Hollywood, whatever that is that they‚Äôre talking about, all the people that slept together.\\" After Phillips' death from cancer in 2002 the book was reissued in paperback by Faber and Faber, and gained renewed attention. Tim Appelo wrote in his Salon.com tribute that it was \\"mordant, merciless, [and] outdid Capote in shrieking truth to decadent power\\", while David Thomson praised it as \\"compulsive, hilarious entertainment\\". Commercially, Phillips' memoir became an enormous success. It quickly moved to the top of the New York Times Non Fiction Best Seller list and stayed at No. 1 for thirteen weeks. Additionally, several prominent Los Angeles bookstore owners reported it to be the fastest-selling book they had ever seen. But Phillips was excoriated by Hollywood, and her autobiography's publication cost her the chance to adapt Anne Rice's Interview with a Vampire with David Geffen. Furthermore, in an example of life imitating art, pre-eminent Los Angeles restaurant Morton's fulfilled the book's titular prediction by declining her future patronage. Shortly before her death, when asked if she had been too cruel in her writing, Phillips replied, \\"We all have our standards. People behaved in an ugly and despicable fashion towards me. I felt no constraints. Nothing I did in my book is as mean as any of the people I wrote about.\\" She was similarly unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying \\"I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother. I was a pariah because I hit them with a harsh, fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are.\\" References Category:1991 non-fiction books Category:Show business memoirs Category:Random House books Category:Books about film ","title":"You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again"},{"id":"20730523","text":"Sadamasu may refer to: * Sadamasu, the previous name of Kunimasu Utagawa ( - 1850s), designer of ukiyo-e woodblock prints * Minami Sadamasu, professional shogi player ","title":"Sadamasu"},{"id":"20730537","text":"Sault Falls (also called Dennery Falls and Errard Falls) is a high waterfall near Dennery in Saint Lucia.

When she returned for a reinspection, she took a picture of the mechanic inspecting the brakes on her car. The mechanic turned around, approached her, pointed his finger at her, and questioned her taking a picture of him. He intentionally touched her camera with his finger. Picard claimed that when she spun around her back was injured. The trial court awarded Picard $60,366 in compensatory damages and an additional $6,350 in punitive damages. The Supreme Court held that the mechanic committed battery, because the mechanic caused an offensive or unconsensual touching upon the body of Picard, regardless of the mechanic's intent to injure. Items attached to or identified with the plaintiff's body, such as the camera, also count. The court also found that the mechanic committed assault.

Ballyraine National School, a co-educational primary school which is under joint management of the Church of Ireland and Presbyterian Church, is also located in the area. Physical distance from the town centre, lack of permeability and lack of neighbourhood facilities result in an isolated neighbourhood with high dependency on car usage for daily conveniences. History Imported coal being loaded onto a lorry at Port Ballyraine, 1938 The area has a rich maritime past. In 1824, when the first description of Letterkenny as a modern town was written, it was stated that: \\"Within half a mile is the Port of Ballyraine, whither vessels of 100 tons bring iron, salt and colonial produce and whence they export hides and butter\\". Port Ballyraine would have seen the regular importation of timber to the building trade and also the poles to carry out the Electrification of Rural Ireland programme during the 1930s. The port was closed to commercial shipping in the 1960s. The 19th-century shipping warehouses were demolished in 2001, a coal yard remains at the Port Bridge.The Port ‚Äì A Short Illustrated History of Port Ballyraine, Letterkenny, Published by John Baird, 2002. The Polestar monument located on the Port Bridge Roundabout serves as a reminder of the area's past. Created by Locky Morris, Its shape alludes to the outline of a boat, as well as having a locomotive (train track) theme, to commemorate the fact that both forms of transportation played a major part in the town's development in the past. In 1990, due to the growing population of the area, it was deemed necessary to construct a church. The Church of the Irish Martyrs was completed in 1994 and became the first church in Ireland to be named after the Irish Catholic Martyrs.

The software contains an automated publishing engine that can manually or automatically produce Postscript and PDF documents with complex page layouts. Entry level pricing through specialized resellers starts between $4,000 and $10,000 USD. Starting with release 12.0.0.0, APP has been rebranded as Arbortext Layout Developer.  History  * Mid-1980s: Swindon-based company Advent Publishing Systems creates 3B2, a desktop publishing application.ISTC UK Article on the Evolution of Arbortext APP 3B2 gained a reputation as a challenger for QuarkXPress, but was soon eclipsed by that product in the DTP world and itself evolved into the high end automation market. The name 3B2 comes from the business park in Swindon (UK) where Advent had its offices at the time. * Early 2000s: Advent integrates more XML technologies into 3B2, allowing users to associate formatting with XML hierarchies. In 2003 Printing World magazine reported that Springer-Verlag was planning to implement an automated page production process. Dr. Patrick Thibor of Springer was quoted as saying \\"we believe that 3B2 is the only tool available for automated page make up and will enable us to meet our goal of totally automatic production of pages\\". As of 2019, Springer Nature (including BMC) was still using it. * 2004: Advent Publishing Systems is purchased by Arbortext to provide a more powerful alternative to that product's existing FOSI/TeX engine. * 2005: Arbortext purchased by PTC to provide technical documentation capabilities in its product lifecycle management tools. * 2009: Integration with the existing Arbortext suite of products released with APP Version 10 and Arbortext 6.0 * 2011: APP Engine becomes default print and PDF engine for all Arbortext products. * 2011: APP Version 11.0 F000 released. * 2015: APP Version 11.1 F000 released. * 2017: APP Version 11.2 F000 released. * 2019: APP Version 12.0.0.0 released.  Uses  APP has traditionally been used for a number of specific typesetting tasks. * Scientific, technical and medical journal publishing, particularly in India. APP's automation, SGML/XML handling and mathematics formatting mean this complex layout task can be automated * Financial typesetting, particularly generation of EDGAR reports for Securities and Exchange Commission filings * Government reports such as Hansard, daily journals and other reports.  Technologies  APP supports processing of marked-up text such as SGML, XML and HTML natively, using a JavaScript based Formatting Object Model API and/or its own proprietary scripting languages and established technologies such as Perl, XPath and Unicode. Its rules-based engine allows the stylesheet builder to automate demanding page make-up tasks and run them in a 'lights out' server mode. APP applies text and page formatting properties with any chevron delimited mark-up such as SGML or XML or non well formed markup. APP 'templates' are stylesheets that comprise page layouts, text formatting styles and scripting. Scripting is used to automate and apply conditions to the publishing process. Traditionally this was done using 'macros', which are low-level system commands. In later versions a JavaScript FOM API was introduced which can be used as automation scripting and powerful inline conditional processing. When using XML, a template can employ XPath or match-statement contexts to specify the exact conditions to which style is applied through the parser. Such conditions can also be configured for SGML and other tagged data using proprietary tools called showstrings. Principal outputs are PostScript and PDF, although APP also provides a number of alternative output drivers. APP provides a WYSIWYG view of pages in the Desktop version, which can be used to manipulate pages after automated composition, or to build templates.

Moustakas (May 26, 1923 ‚Äì 10 October 2012) was an American psychologist and one of the leading experts on humanistic and clinical psychology. He helped establish the Association for Humanistic Psychology and the Journal of Humanistic Psychology. He is the author of numerous books and articles on humanistic psychology, education and human science research. His most recent books: Phenomenological Research Methods; Heuristic Research; Existential Psychotherapy and the Interpretation of Dreams; Being-In, Being- For, Being-With; and Relationship Play Therapy are valuable additions to research and clinical literature. His focus at the Michigan School of Professional Psychology (formerly the Center for Humanistic Studies) was the integration of philosophy, research and psychology in the education and training of humanistic clinical psychologists. Biography Clark Moustakas, Ed.D., Ph.D. Educational and Clinical Psychology, Columbia University, President Emeritus and Co-Founder, Center for Humanistic Studies (CHS). Moustakas co-founded CHS with Cereta Perry, Ph.D., Bruce Douglass, Ph.D., and Diane Blau, Ph.D. CHS was renamed the Michigan School of Professional Psychology (MiSPP) in 2006 and offers both an M.A. and PsyD program in Clinical Psychology. In 1949 Moustakas joined the faculty at the Merrill- Palmer Institute (MPI) at Wayne State University in Detroit, MI. In 1953 he wrote his first book, Children in Play Therapy. In 1956 he compiled Publication of The Self, the result of the dialogues between Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, himself and others, forging the Humanistic Psychology movement. Meetings were held at 40 E. Ferry Ave. in Detroit, MI. Moustakas's book Loneliness was released to public acclaim in 1961 and became the basis of heuristic research. In 1962 Moustakas participated in the formation of the American Association of Humanistic Psychology and the creation of the Journal of Humanistic Psychology. In 1980-1981 Clark Moustakas, Cereta Perry, Diane Blau, and Bruce Douglas co-created the Center for Humanistic Studies (CHS), establishing independence from the Merrill Palmer Institute (MPI). In 1984 CHS received full accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA). From 1990-1994 Moustakas published Heuristic Research: Design, Methodology and Applications and Phenomenological Research Methods. In 2004 Moustakas and his daughter Kerry published Loneliness, Creativity, and Love: Awakening Meanings in Life.

It is the longest east-west road in the city of Evanston, where it stretches for over two miles (3 km) from the city limits west of Crawford Avenue to its eastern intersection with Sheridan Road near the historic Grosse Point Lighthouse. West of Evanston, the street begins in Glenview and runs westward intermittently through various municipalities, where it is alternately known as Central Road, Central Parkway, and Central Street. The street is located at 2600 N in the Evanston grid system and 10100 N in the Chicago grid system.http://www.egovlink.com/public_documents300/skokie/published_documents/Skokie%20Street%20Map.pdf History and name Central Street has a non-central location in Evanston; the name dates to when the street was the principal thoroughfare for the village of North Evanston, which was annexed to Evanston in 1874. Transportation Metra station Central Street has been extensively served by mass transit for over a century. The Chicago & Milwaukee Railroad began service from Chicago to Waukegan in 1855. The Chicago and North Western Railway took over the line in 1866, and the Central Street station (at Green Bay Road) still stands today as a Metra stop on the Union Pacific/North Line. An Evanston trolley system operated electric streetcars down Central Street from 1897 to 1935. Light rail service connecting the neighborhood with Chicago reached Central Street in 1908, when the right-of-way of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad, a would-be competitor of the CN&W;, on tracks a half-mile east, was leased to a trolley company. Today the north- south line is operated by the CTA, which maintains a Central Street stop on the Purple Line. In rush hours there is express service to the Loop. Four different bus routes serve the neighborhood, with two running directly down Central Street itself. Central Street is classified by the Illinois Department of Transportation as an unmarked state-maintained road. The street is wide enough in portions for four lanes and contains sections that are part of Evanston's bicycle plan. The community takes an active interest in bicycling as transportation, including as part of multi-modal transportation. Sections of Central Street were striped in 2010 for dedicated bike lanes. Evanston's 2000 Comprehensive General Plan identified the Central Street \\"corridor\\" as a location for increased residential density because of the mass transit availability, but noted that \\"sensitivity to the surrounding neighborhoods\\" would be essential to prevent over-congestion and incompatible design; the same study identified Central Street as an area where there was already a significant shortage of parking. Business The Central Street district is frequently referred to as \\"unique,\\" even in Evanston city code, which refers to \\"diverse, unique, small-scale, pedestrian-oriented retail shops, services and restaurants.\\" Regional publications, the real estate industry, and travel publications take note of the \\"specialty shops and restaurants\\" that exist in a walkable environment with an eclectic, vintage \\"small-town feel.\\" The shopping district is a destination that draws customers from outside the area; a 2005 study done for the Village of Wilmette identified the \\"core\\" of Central Street (identified as the shopping area around the intersection of Central Street and Green Bay Road) as a direct competitor of the Green Bay Road Corridor in Wilmette, that \\"attracts many residents from southeast Wilmette for basic shopping.\\" The local merchants have their own association and a Facebook page that lists many businesses. Culture and art The Central Street district includes a number of art galleries and antique stores. It is home to the Mitchell Museum of the American Indian and the Evanston Art Center. Since 1952 the North Branch of the Evanston library system has been located on Central Street. A large and active community organization, the Central Street Neighbors Association, maintains an interactive website with neighborhood and cultural news. Development and zoning issuesCanyonization= In 2004, the potential overdevelopment of Central Street became an issue after the construction of several new multi-use, multi-story buildings up to the limit of the lot line, larger in scale than the vast majority that housed existing businesses. Residents generally opposed the potential \\"canyonization\\" of the street. Canyonization of the street became an issue in the 2005 municipal election. After a year of activism by residents and numerous municipal and ward meetings, the City of Evanston in November 2005, amended its zoning ordinance to create a new \\"B1a\\" district, extending for several blocks on the western portion of Central Street, \\"characterized by having reduced building height and residential density.\\" =Evanston Theatre redevelopment= In 2006 a development team requested a site development allowance and special use permit from the City Council in order to demolish a structure on the 1700 block of Central, east of Green Bay road, housing the shuttered Evanston Theatre, a restaurant, and a number of storefronts, to make way for a 5-story, 51-unit mixed-use condominium development. After the developers modified the proposal to four stories, with upper floors stepped back slightly from the street, the Council approved the project in February 2007, over neighbors' objections. =Central Street Master Plan= In response to some of the previous controversies, the City of Evanston in the winter of 2006‚Äì07 began a long-urged comprehensive planning of Central Street. A Master Plan was adopted in June 2007, and ordinances passed in January 2008 that re- zoned the corridor, including the first steps toward form-based code in Evanston. Fourth of July parade Central Street serves as the route for the Evanston Fourth of July parade. The Evanston Fourth of July Association, a 501(c)3 not-for-profit, has held the parade since 1922. The celebration was started by the North End Mothers' Club in response to a child being injured by firecrackers the previous year. The parade attracts about 15,000 spectators each year, and Country Home magazine ranked it as the third-best Fourth of July celebration in 2003, after Washington, DC and Boston. The parade became a subject of local controversy in the early 2000s due to attendees who put chairs, tape, and other markers along the route weeks ahead of time. Central Street residents became irritated at the chairs, and many complained to the city government about the issue. The city responded by passing an ordinance which prohibited residents from placing chairs and blankets along the parade route prior to July 1; city workers remove any items (chairs etc.) placed earlier. The ordinance also outlawed the use of rope or tape to reserve a spot.

As a state government entity, Dairy Council of California is funded by California‚Äôs dairy farmers and milk processors through assessments collected by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. History of organization The Dairy Council of California (formerly called California Dairy Council) was established on Feb 8, 1919. The organization was conceived during San Francisco Bay ferryboat commuter trips by two well-known California dairy industry leaders, Sam H. Greene and Chester Earl Gray after reading about discoveries in the field of nutrition in the early 1900s. Two articles published in Hoards Dairyman specifically caught their attention, ‚ÄúThe Present Situation in Nutrition‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Dairy Industry and Human Welfare‚Äù written by Dr. E.V. McCollum from the University of Wisconsin who discovered vitamin A. McCollum characterized vitamin A as a ‚Äúvital life substance in dairy fat‚Äù.Jones, RE, Industry Builder, The Biography of Chester Earl Gray. Pacific Books, Palo Alto, 1948, p.95-99 Other significant events happening in the country at this time include the formation of the California Farm Bureau Federation and the formation of the National Dairy Council in 1915. Cities around the country were experimenting with school feeding programs in the early 1900s. All these events inspired Greene and Gray to bridge the link between nutrition science and dairy products that led to the formation of the non-profit organization California Dairy Council, made up of volunteer producers and distributors. They saw an opportunity to provide service for the public as well as the dairy industry. Sam H Greene was the first secretary- manager and F. J. Cummings was the first president of the newly formed California Dairy Council. Greene served as manager of the California Dairy Council for 30 years. Dairy Council‚Äôs first order of business upon formation was a statewide survey of school nutrition. California Dairy Council worked with schools and teachers to survey 130,000 school children and found that on average 36% of children in cities did not receive milk on a regular basis.California Dairy Council Annual Report, July 1, 1920 The results of this survey were instrumental in adding milk to the school lunch menu. By 1922, California Dairy Council implemented a school milk service to nearly every major city in the state. By 1950, per capita daily milk consumption increased by nearly 25 percent.Dairy Bonanza- California Early Recognized as Ideal Cattle Country,‚Äù Argonaut, San Francisco, Calif., September 1, 1950. The 1920s and 30s brought the California Dairy Council‚Äôs first big strides in nutrition education, beginning with the ‚ÄúDairy Product for Health‚Äù campaign targeting PTA parents. It was a time when many children had rickets and other nutritional deficiencies. ‚ÄúWe gave people something of real value without expecting anything in return,‚Äù said Greene of his efforts. ‚ÄúWe did this in the firm belief that when facts about our products reached the people in the form of education, we would reap our rewards in increased use of milk and other dairy products.‚Äù The Mobile Dairy Classroom began in the 1930s as a joint venture between the California Dairy Council and Venice, CA dairyman Clarence Michel of Edgemar Farms. Michel would travel weekly to Los Angeles-area schools in a truck built to accommodate a live cow and teach children how milk and dairy foods were produced. After World War II, the Dairy Council teamed with Los Angeles City Schools and hired a professional teacher to increase the program‚Äôs educational impact. Ultimately, the program expanded to include 5 trucks and is available throughout most of California.Dairy Council of California News, August 1981. In 1945, the California Dairy Council was reorganized by the California State Legislature through establishment of the California Dairy Industry Advisory Board. This newly formed board adopted the principles of California Dairy Council and began working closely with the National Dairy Council. Alfred H Ghormley served as the first chairman of the board and Richard Werner was the first manager. The California Dairy Council continued but as a sub-unit of the California Industry Advisory Board. In 1961, the California Dairy Council (Joe Hart, president) relinquished its name to the California Dairy Industry Advisory Board and the Advisory Board became the Dairy Council of California, giving it a better identification with the educational material used from the National Dairy Council. W. B Woodburn was manager and A.W. Clark was chairman of the board of the newly named Dairy Council of California. By 1963 the Dairy Council of California had grown to employ 19 staff members in 5 offices. The work of the Dairy Council of California expanded beyond schools to include youth clubs, banks, hospitals, medical conventions, and nursing schools.Dairy Council of California Annual Report, 1964. In 2009, Dairy Council of California celebrates 90 years of service.

History of program development Beginning in the 1960s, under the direction of Doug Fisk, Manager, the Dairy Council of California developed comprehensive two-week programs designed to promote behavior change. The Director of Education, Rus Shortridge worked with the well known teacher, Madeline Hunter from UCLA University Elementary School to develop the educational methodology behind the new programs.Hunter, M. (1982). Mastery Teaching. Thousand Oaks, Corwin Press. The Madeline Hunter mastery teaching education methodology became the basis of four new Dairy Council of California programs: Little Ideas for Pre-School Children; Big Ideas Balanced Meals for Second Grade ; Daily Food Choices for Fifth Grade; and Big Ideas for Consumers for high school students.Niedermeyer, et al.

Self-embedding is typically considered deliberate self-harm, also known as nonsuicidal self-injury, which is defined as \\"deliberate, direct destruction of tissues without suicidal intent.\\" Controversy Based on the review of the literature it is unclear whether self-embedding falls under the definition of deliberate self-harm. Some studies include self-embedding as a deliberate self-harm behavior while others exclude it. Most definitions of deliberate self-harm include the stipulation that the behavior is performed without conscious suicidal intent. The connection between self-embedding and suicidal ideation is unclear. Although most self-injurious behaviors are not associated with suicidal intentions, self-embedding has been found to be associated with suicidal ideation. A study found that suicidal ideation is the most commonly reported reason for self- embedding, however not all acts of self-embedding are accompanied with suicidal ideations. Additionally, most people that partake in self-embedding behavior report having previous suicidal attempts and suicidal ideations. Other distinctions between self-embedding and other self-injurious behaviors are that self-embedding is highly comorbid with behavioral health diagnoses and has a high prevalence of repetitive behavior. Self-embedding is similar to other forms of self-injury in that one of the purposes of engaging in the behavior is to relieve emotional distress by inflicting physical pain. Albert Fish with 27 inserted needles An X-ray image of Graphophone needles driven into the flesh by a psychiatric patient. History One of the first reported cases of self-embedding was in 1936 when Albert Fish, a serial killer and cannibal, was caught and executed.Murder Cases of the Twentieth Century ‚Äì Biographies and Bibliographies of 280 Convicted or Accused Killers, David K. Frasier, McFarland & Company (Publisher), Copyright September, 1996 An X-ray of his pelvis revealed about 27‚Äì29 needles inserted into his groin; the image was used as evidence at his trial.\\"Albert Fish\\". Crime Library. Archived from the original on 16 December 2008. Retrieved 2008-12-16 He also embedded needles into his abdomen. In 1986 Gould and Pyle described self-embedding behavior in their book Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine. They included reports of adult European women with hysteria who self-embedded by inserting needles into their body. In 2010 a study by Young et al. was one of the first to describe self-embedding in an adolescent population. Epidemiology The majority of people who engage in self-embedding are white teenage females with psychiatric diagnoses. Self-embedding has a high comorbidity with other psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative disorder, and borderline personality disorder. Additionally, deliberate self- harm is associated with externalizing pathology such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder. Adolescents who self-injure have higher mean depression scores and report more depressive symptoms than adolescents who do not self-injure. They also report more symptoms of anxiety. Life stressors such as sexual abuse, witnessing family violence or experiencing a traumatic event have also been found to be associated with deliberate self-harm. The frequency and the presence of deliberate self-harm are correlated with the number of stressful life events adolescents report. Adolescents with a history of deliberate self-harm report more stressful life events and those with higher rates for these experiences were more likely to repetitively engage in the behavior. Empirical studies have identified risk factors and correlates for self-injurious behavior. Some of these factors include a history of childhood abuse, the presence of a mental disorder, poor verbal skills, and identifying with Goth subculture. The mean age for nonsuicidal self-injury is 13‚Äì15 years and for suicidal self-injury is 15‚Äì17 years of age. About 2% of inmates each year engage in self-injurious behavior, which includes the insertion of foreign objects into the body. The lifetime prevalence rates of deliberate self-harm in adolescence ranges from 13%‚Äì56% in non-clinical community samples. Approximately 4% of the United States population and 13‚Äì23% of adolescents report a history of nonsuicidal self-injury. The most commonly used objects for insertion are long and thin such as sewing needles and paperclips. Also urethral insertion of foreign objects is more common in males than females with a 1.7:1 ratio. Symptoms In order to assess self- embedding different aspects of the behavior must be examined such as the type of object used, the site of insertion, the number of objects inserted, the motivation behind the behavior and if the patient has other psychiatric diagnoses. The most common symptoms for epithelial insertion of foreign objects are infection, abscess formation, or sepsis at the site of insertion. Symptoms of urethral insertion include frequent urination, painful urination, and blood in urination. Urethral stricture can occur with multiple attempts to insert an object into the urethra. Mucosal tears are associated with multiple objects being inserted or with multiple attempts as well. In order to assess the size, location and number of foreign objects a radiological evaluation is needed. Symptoms for vaginal insertion are vaginal pain, discharge, bleeding, and foul odor, which can indicate infection. Treatment Image guided foreign body removal (IGFBR) = To treat urethral insertion of foreign objects endoscopic retrieval is utilized and an antibiotic is given. If there is an infection or abscess formation at the site of insertion, surgical removal of the object is necessary. If a patient has multiple objects inserted in a certain area surgical removal is recommended unless the risks of surgery outweigh the benefits. Percutaneous image guided foreign body removal (IGFBR) is another less invasive option for removing foreign bodies that leaves minimal scarring. Multiple studies have found IGFBR as a safe and effective technique for the removal of foreign bodies. In this procedure hydrodissection can be used to define the foreign body more precisely and facilitate its removal. = Psychological treatments = Problem-Solving Therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy are two empirically supported Cognitive Behavioral Therapies for non-suicidal self-injurious behavior. Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) teaches clients problem-solving skills and general coping strategies so that they can more effectively deal with future problems. Additionally, clients learn to identify and resolve the problems they encounter. The findings for the effectiveness of PST in reducing non-suicidal self-injury have been mixed. Some studies have found that PST has reduced suicidal behaviors compared to usual treatments however maintenance beyond one year was not found. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) aims to teach clients general coping skills and address any motivational obstacles to treatment. Therapy includes validating the client's experience and working with the client on problem-solving skills and behavioral skills such as emotional regulation. DBT has been used to treat both suicidal behaviors and non- suicidal self-injurious behaviors. DBT has been shown to reduce self-injurious behaviors in multiple studies. Theory The Experiential Avoidance Model (EAM) = According to this model, the maintenance of deliberate self-harm behavior is due to negative reinforcement. Deliberate self-harm is reinforced because it prevents or takes away negative emotional experiences. The experiential avoidance model was developed to account for deliberate self-harm for various populations not just ones with psychopathology. Experiential avoidance behaviors are those that ‚Äúfunction to avoid or escape from unwanted internal experiences.\\" The mechanism for this model involves an individual experiencing an event that evokes an aversive emotional response, which causes the individual to want to escape from that unpleasant emotional state. The individual engages in deliberate self-harm, which reduces or gets rid of the aversive emotional response. This behavior is then negatively enforced. Many studies have found that 80‚Äì94% of people report feeling better after engaging in deliberate self-harm, with relief being the most reported. Furthermore, studies done on the self-reported reasons for deliberate self-harm have found that the primary reasons given for engaging in the behavior are related to avoiding, eliminating or escaping internal experiences. A study conducted on female college students investigated emotional responses of women with and without deliberate self-harm and found that women who engage in self-harm reported higher levels of experiential avoidance. Factors that may underlie an increase in experiential avoidance are higher levels of impulsivity or novelty seeking and heightened levels of aversive physiological arousal to emotional events. Other factors include a low tolerance for emotional distress and a failure to use different, less maladaptive behaviors in response to emotional arousal. The EAM provides multiple hypotheses for how deliberate self-harm provides an emotional escape. The opioid hypothesis explains that deliberate self-harm elicits endogenous opioids, which leads to analgesia and relief of emotional distress. Studies have found elevated levels of opioid peptides in people who engage in deliberate self-harm however, there is not much research supporting an increase in opioid levels after deliberate self-harm. Another explanation could be that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm have increased activity of the opiate system which can lead to a feeling of dissociation and numbness and deliberate self-harm provides physical pain that ends this dissociative state. An alternative explanation for why deliberate self-harm provides relief is that it shifts attention away from the unpleasant emotions being experienced. Empirical evidence for this hypothesis is mixed; some studies have found distraction to be one of the most common self-reported reasons for engaging in deliberate self-harm while others have found the contrary. The self-punishment hypothesis claims that deliberate self-harm can decrease emotional arousal by confirming an individual's negative self- concepts such as that they are bad or have done something wrong. Multiple studies have found that self-punishment is commonly reported as a reason for engaging in deliberate self-harm. Self-punishment is reinforced because it ‚Äúalleviates distress associated with negative thoughts about oneself\\" and has the potential to lessen external punishment. = Nock's Theoretical Model = Based on his review on the literature on self-injury, Matthew Nock, developed a theoretical model on the development and maintenance of self-injury. According to Nock's model self-injury is performed repeatedly because it is an immediate effective way of influencing one's social environment and regulating one's emotional and cognitive experience. Additionally, factors that contribute to problems in regulating one's affective and cognitive state and influencing one's social environment such as poor social skills lead to an increased risk of self-injury. These general risk factors also increase the likelihood of engaging in other maladaptive behaviors such as alcohol or substance abuse. This model follows a functional perspective in which behaviors are caused by the events that immediately precede and follow them. Four types of reinforcement processes can maintain self-injury: intrapersonal negative reinforcement, intrapersonal positive reinforcement, interpersonal positive reinforcement, and interpersonal negative reinforcement. Intrapersonal negative reinforcement refers to self-injury being followed by a decrease or stop of aversive thoughts or feelings. Intrapersonal positive reinforcement involves self-injury being followed by an increase in desired thoughts or feelings such as a feeling of satisfaction. Interpersonal positive reinforcement occurs when self-injury is followed by a desired social event such as attention or support. Finally, interpersonal negative reinforcement occurs when self-injury is followed by a decrease or stop of a social event. Many studies investigating the motives reported for engaging in self-injury provide evidence for this four-function model.

The use of the term \\"jet ski\\" for all types of PWCs is a misnomer; Jet Ski is a registered trademark in the United States for a line of PWCs manufactured by Kawasaki). With the increased use of personal watercraft since their inception, the hazards accompanying their use have also increased. According to U.S. government reports, most accidents are associated with rental operators, underage operators, under- trained and undereducated boaters and a variety of factors associated with recreational-boating accidents (excessive speed, inattention, reckless operation, alcohol consumption and violations of the \\"Rules of the Road\\").Almost all bodies of water in the United States are governed by the Inland Navigation Rules or their state law equivalents. These \\"rules\\" are typically referred to as the \\"rules of the road.\\" Due to their affordability, ease of use, and relatively low transportation and maintenance costs, personal watercraft have significantly increased the number of water-based enthusiasts in the U.S. This rise in participation has created conflicts between the various boating segments in the U.S. and a need for additional boater education. Recreational-boating accidents are the second-largest transportation-related cause of injury in the U.S. (after automobile accidents).NTSB Boating Safety Report (1993)  Background  One Person watercraft are vessels designed for recreational use on the water, carrying between one and four passengers. The U.S. Coast Guard defines PWC as \\"craft less than 13 feet in length designed to be operated by a person or persons sitting, standing or kneeling on the craft rather than within the confines of a hull\\".\\"Boating Statistics 2006.\\" Retrieved on December 15, 2008 The original PWCs were manufactured during the mid-1950s in the United Kingdom and Europe. Ten years later Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP) began manufacturing PWC's in the USA under the name Sea-Doo. BRP left the PWC business shortly thereafter, and in 1973 Kawasaki introduced a \\"stand-up\\" watercraft designed for a single operator (with a tray for standing or kneeling, in place of a seat). By the late 1980s \\"sit-down\\" models had appeared on the market, allowing the rider to be seated (similar to a snowmobile or motorcycle seat). These sit-down models were made by Kawasaki (1986), Yamaha (1987) and BRP (1988). Polaris and Arctic were two American companies which entered the market during the early 1990s. PWC have an inboard engine with a screw-shaped impeller to create thrust and propulsion for steering. They are small, fast, and easy to maneuver; PWCs do not use external propellers, making them safer for swimmers and wildlife. The user-friendly properties of PWCs have contributed to the increase in popularity amongst less-experienced watercraft users. To increase safety, a number of U.S. consumer groups suggested that all boats should utilize the jet-drive mechanism (also called a pump-jet) employed by PWC manufacturers since this would reduce the risk of propeller injuries.The Coast Guard's Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for houseboats provided that houseboats should either have a propeller guard installed or be converted to jet drive power.  Accidents  All boating accidents in the United States either occur on state- or federally-patrolled waters. Whether state or federal, reports must be filed for a predefined level of damage and are compiled by the United States Coast Guard (which uses the reported data for its annual BAR‚ÄîBoating Accident Report‚ÄîStatistical Reports). As automotive law-enforcement officers outnumber boating law-enforcement officers in the U.S., federal government reports for watercraft are comparatively fewer.As a general rule of thumb the Coast Guard believes that it receives about 10% of the \\"property damage only\\" accidents, but 90% of the serious personal injury accidents. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) conducted general investigation of the recreational-boating accident- reporting system in 1998 and compiled its findings in a published report.National Transportation Safety Board: Personal Watercraft Safety.\\" 1998. http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/8000/8400/8418/SS9801.pdf Retrieved on December 13, 2008 The NTSB's investigation emerged with data seen as representative of overall recreational boating; an example follows from the report's conclusion: > Inattention (attributed to 307 operators), inexperience (attributed to 296 > operators), and inappropriate speed for the operating conditions (attributed > to 246 operators) were the most frequently cited causes that contributed to > the PWC accidents. One or more of these three causes were associated with 70 > percent of the 814 accidents. A fourth cause, improper lookout (153), was > associated with about one-fifth of the accidents.Page 18-19 of NTSB Report > (1998). This results in 90% of all accidents being attributed to improper > lookout, inexperience, inappropriate speed and inattention. The remaining > 10% of the accidents were mostly due to rules of the road infractions, > weather or environmental conditions and other \\"unknown\\" causes. According to the aforementioned interpretation of the NTSB report: * The vast majority of accidents (over 90 percent) were caused by operator error. * There is a significantly higher association with accidents for rental operators (nearly 25 percent) than is the case for the general boating population; however, this may be related to the higher percentage of rental operators.\\"The Safety Board is concerned about persons who rent PWC. Nearly one-quarter of the PWC operators involved in the 1997 accidents analyzed by the Safety Board for this study (292 of 1,218, or 24 percent) were operating rented PWC\\" NTSB Report (page 33) * The NTSB report did not conclude that PWCs are disproportionately represented in boating-accident statistics.\\"The study was not designed to estimate how often PWC accidents occur, nor are the results of the study necessarily representative of all PWC accidents\\". Page i. \\"However, in 1994 the number of PWC fatalities began to increase noticeably because the number of PWCs in operation increased\\". Page v. \\"The increase in PWC fatalities is proportional to the increase of PWC in operation.\\" Page 2. A study performed by the Red Cross in 1991 concluded that during the research period, PWC accidents were not disproportionate to their use by the boating population. This was later supported by a Coast Guard study presented to the State of Vermont in 1996. Both studies presented findings that the comparative accident rates for personal water craft were not disproportionate to their use by the boating population; the reports emphasized the high level of attention and publicity that PWC accidents receive.There is a difference between comparing the number accidents to the number of registrations, as opposed to comparing the number of accidents to the actual hours of use of the boats. Large yachts, which spend most of their time sitting at the marina, are less at risk of an accident due to the low hours of use. During the late 1990s, several states (including California and Florida, two jurisdictions which, according to the NTSB report, accounted for over 50 percent of all personal- water-craft accidents in the U.S.) changed their laws regarding the use of personal water craft. These amendments included the introduction of limits for wake-jumping, the prescribed use of a PWC within of another vessel, \\"spraying\\" activities, mandated operation of PWCs within of the shoreline, and age restrictions for operators (the operator age was raised from 12 to 16 years for all affected states, with Florida also introducing a mandatory boating- safety course for those under age 18).National Transportation Safety Board: Personal Watercraft Safety.\\" 1998.

Retrieved on December 15, 2008 Excessive speed accounted for nearly 15 percent of all PWC-related accidents in 2007, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. = Off-throttle steering = The steering characteristics of jet boats (including personal watercraft) when they are \\"off throttle\\" seem to differ from conventional steering. All recreational planing boats steer with thrust. Jet boats (including PWCs) generate that thrust with a moveable nozzle connected to a jet pump; propeller boats generate thrust through a downward-placed, exposed propeller. The fact that the propeller is placed downward in the water and is exposed means that even when it is not generating thrust that some amount of steering effect is possible. Jet boats have no downward projection, and achieve no additional steering effect from the device. If the operator of a jet boat releases the throttle, steering effectiveness decreases roughly in proportion to thrust reduction. The NTSB related an example of an off-throttle steering accident in the personal watercraft safety study of 1998: > The Florida Marine Patrol accident description states, \\"[Operator] was > attempting to make a turn south through a cut in the mangroves . . . . He > was not real familiar with operating a jet ski with a passenger. When he > attempted to make a left turn he let off the throttle which caused the PWC > to lose steering capabilities. The forward momentum of the PWC took > [operator] and passenger into the mangrove shoreline. [Operator] received a > puncture wound to the left side of his neck . . . .\\" According to the NTSB, 24 percent of reported PWC accidents list steering problems or loss of control as contributing factors; in Florida, it is the second-leading cause of PWC-related accidents. PWC manufacturers have been working to develop a system to prevent off-throttle steering. Modifications have been made to solve this problem in newer PWC models.Ride Technology: Off Throttle Steering http://www.ridetechnology.com/offThrottle.html. Retrieved on December 15, 2008 = Driver inexperience = Because of the ease of operating a PWC, little training and experience is required to perform basic maneuvers of a PWC. The NTSB reported in 1998 that 32 percent of operators involved in accidents reported that they had operated a vessel between zero and ten times prior to the accident; 86 never, 75 once and 225 between 2 and 10 times. Of the 712 operators who were asked about training, 84 percent said they had received no training and the other 16 percent participated in some boating training. Regulations concerning training courses and age limits for operators vary by state and by country. In the U.S. the minimum operator age ranges from 12‚Äì18 years; young operators may require adult supervision on the vessel and training in accordance with local laws. = Internal Orifice Injuries = One particularly serious type of personal watercraft injury occurs when a female rider falls off the back of the craft and into the path of the craft's high- pressure water jet.http://www.insiderexclusive.com/justice-in- america/dangerous-sports-the-personal-watercraft-industry The jet thrust is powerful enough to push water into the rider's orifices, which can result in severe internal injuries to the rider's vagina, rectum or anus, and possibly death.http://www.insiderexclusive.com/justice-in-america/dangerous-sports-the- personal-watercraft-industry For example, in 2014, the California Court of Appeal for the Fourth Appellate District, Division One upheld in full a San Diego County jury verdict against Bombardier Recreational Products and two other defendants in favor of two plaintiffs injured simultaneously in a single 2007 fall from a PWC, which included awards, respectively, of $3.385 million and $1.063 million in compensatory damages (with liability divided in equal portions among the three defendants).Colombo v. BRP US Inc., 230 Cal. App. 4th 1442; 179 Cal. Rptr. 3d 580 (2014). As the appellate court explained in its opinion, this case was delayed after the PWC owner initiated a proceeding in federal court under the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851. The appellate court also affirmed awards of $1.5 million in punitive damages against BRP alone for each plaintiff (adding up to $3 million in punitive damages) which were based on the jury's express finding that BRP's conduct manifested a \\"reckless or callous disregard for the rights of others\\". However, on the other hand, there are also examples where the owner, operator, and/or user of the personal watercraft have been found entirely at fault by a jury without any fault whatsoever on the manufacturer. For example, in 2010 in a case argued in the federal court of the Middle District of Florida, a jury found the 2006 Sea-Doo safe and not defective as to design, warnings, manufacture, and that BRP was not negligent in the design of its product. See Christina Thomas v. Bombardier Recreational Products, Inc., CASE NO.: 2:07-CV-00730-JES- SPC (M.D. Fla. 2010). BRP maintained the Sea-Doo was reasonably safe, state- of-the-art, compliant with industry standards as well as the U.S. Coast Guard's standards, and was not the cause of plaintiff's injuries and/or accident. The plaintiff testified she did not have any conversation with anyone concerning the use of protective gear, such as wet suit bottoms or equivalent protective clothing and was not provided any safety information before riding. http://www.rumberger.com/?t=40&an;=4502&format;=xml&p;=4944 During the trial, the operator admitted he saw, but chose not to read, the onboard warning label. He also admitted that he did not read the safety recommendations in the operator‚Äôs guide nor watch the safety video. Counsel for BRP in the Thomas case, Scott Sarason, commented on the case that, ‚ÄúStatistically speaking, the probability of the type of incident involved in this case is extremely rare. Owners, operators and passengers of personal watercrafts must think safety first. It‚Äôs important for people to realize that these watercraft are classified as boats. That‚Äôs why the watercraft industry has been working diligently with authorities like the U.S. Coast Guard to introduce programs like ‚ÄòKnow Before You Go‚Äô in an effort to prevent accidents and injuries.‚Äù http://www.rumberger.com/?t=40&an;=4502&format;=xml&p;=4944 The Thomas case is just one example, of a handful, where such a rare accident is caused by extraneous persons or factors (including, but not limited to, the presence of alcohol, operator inexperience/inattention, careless or reckless operation, violation of state/local boating laws, failure on the part of the operator and/or owner to convey necessary safety information provided by the manufacturer, etc.).

He was also a world champion and record breaker in gliding. Early life Goodhart was born at Inkpen, Berkshire, the son of a patent engineer. He was educated at Miss White's Kintbury, and Connaught House Weymouth. Early career Goodhart entered the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth in the Hawke Term in 1933. He then attended the Royal Naval Engineering College at Keyham, Devonport. He served as an engineering lieutenant, and saw action in the evacuation of Crete in 1941 on which was hit by two bombs. He then served on and saw more action escorting convoys to Malta and the assaults on Italy over the next two years. He undertook pilot training in Canada in 1944 and joined the Fleet Air Arm. While flying in a Grumman Hellcat with 896 Naval Air Squadron from the carrier off the coast of the Nicobar Islands, he ditched because of engine failure on 11 July 1945 and was picked up by the destroyer, . Goodhart graduated from the Empire Test Pilots' School at Cranfield in 1946 and later tested the turboprop Westland Wyvern fighter for acceptance by the Royal Navy for use on aircraft carriers. He survived five serious incidents including the implosion of the aircraft's canopy during a high-speed dive. He then became senior pilot of 700 Squadron at RNAS Yeovilton before returning to test pilot duties at the Naval Air Station (NAS) Donibristle, Scotland; the Aircraft and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;) at Boscombe Down, Wiltshire; and the US Naval Air Test Center, Maryland, USA. During his military career he flew over 50 types of aircraft. After a period as technical secretary at the Ministry of Supply he was promoted to commander in 1953. Carrier developments Trials after 1945 by the Royal Navy revealed that the new jet aircraft had slow throttle responses and could not safely use the standard deck landing technique then in use. Even in peacetime, carrier operations killed 20% of the aircrew.Sailplane & Gliding Interview with Nick Goodhart April/May 2010. Goodhart therefore invented the mirror-sight deck landing system in 1951. The device was first introduced in the Royal Navy in 1954 and by the US Navy in 1955. It greatly increased the safety when landing on an aircraft carrier. There was also a saving in arrester gear units and barriers ‚Äì Ark Royal needed only four wires and one (emergency only) barrier. The reduction in weight and the extra space that this conferred enabled more mess-decks to be fitted in, thus reducing congestion in living spaces. It was recorded that for US carriers, the landing accident rate fell by 80% from 35 per 10,000 landings in 1954 to 7 per 10,000 landings in 1957. The US Navy awarded him the Legion of Merit for his invention and he received an undisclosed sum from the Admiralty. Later naval career After a further spell at Yeovilton, Goodhart was posted to the air warfare department at the Admiralty and then at sea as the staff aviation officer to the flag officer aircraft carriers. He was promoted to Captain in 1962 and made project manager of the Sea Dart anti-aircraft missile programme. After a course at the Imperial Defence College in 1965, he became director of aircraft maintenance and repair in the Admiralty until 1968. He was then promoted to commodore and then rear-admiral and became director of defence operational requirements and finally military deputy to the head of defence sales. He was appointed Companion in The Most Honourable Order of the Bath in 1972 and he retired from the Royal Navy in 1973. Gliding Goodhart joined Yorkshire Gliding Club in 1938, quickly going solo within a week. He was also at various times a member of Cambridge University Gliding Club and Lasham Gliding Society. He began gliding competitively, at first with his brother, Tony, winning the British Team Championship in 1950. In 1955 he climbed to in USA and became the first British glider pilot to gain the Diamond Badge.Australian Gliding magazine March 1955Australian Gliding magazine Nov 1955 Later in 1955 he broke the British National Altitude Record in a Schweizer SGS 1-23 in California climbing to . He was a member of the British team at the World Championships from 1956 to 1972. In 1956 at Saint- Yan in France, he and Frank Foster won the World Gliding Two Seater Championship in a Slingsby Eagle. The US Soaring magazine noted that the only single seater to beat them was the winner, Paul MacCready. He finished in second place in the single seater World Championships in 1958 Leszno, Poland, and fourth in 1960 and 1972. He was British single-seater champion on three occasions (1962, 1967 & 1971), and in second place on four others. He finished first in the American Championships in 1955, though as foreigner could not be the US Champion. At Lasham on 10 May 1959 he declared a goal of Portmoak in Scotland and achieved a record goal flight of in a Slingsby Skylark 3 at an average speed of . This is still the UK 20 metre goal distance record and the speed record for a goal flight. During his gliding career he held eleven British records. Goodhart set up the project in 1966 to develop a glider called Sigma to compete in the 1970 World Championship Open class. After problems during production and then with its Fowler flaps, the only prototype flew in 1971. In a modified form the Sigma is still flying. He was awarded the Silver Medal by the Royal Aero Club in 1956. In 1972 he was award the Paul Tissandier Diploma by the FAI. This award recognizes \\"those who have served the cause of Aviation in general and Sporting Aviation in particular, by their work, initiative, devotion or in other ways\\". Human-powered flight Goodhart's team put in over 3,000 man-hours of effort developing the two seater Newbury Manflier project in an effort to win the Kremer prize for man- powered flight. The aircraft's two pilots were seventy feet apart, each in their own fuselage. However the team was beaten by Goodhart's old rival Paul MacCready with the Gossamer Condor's flight in 1977 and by the Gossamer Albatross for the first cross-Channel flight in 1979. The project was terminated soon after the first flights had been achieved in 1979 because the hangar and runway at Greenham Common were required for the US Air Force.Simon Grant Other activities Goodhart was a consultant to Boeing (1973‚Äì1980) during which time the Royal Navy acquired a hydrofoil HMS Speedy and the RAF acquired its first Chinooks. He held directorships including at the Lancashire and Yorkshire Building Society and was a member at Lloyd's where he gained and lost large sums over a period of 20 years. He was elected Master of the Worshipful Company of Grocers of the City of London. He finished 35th of 350 in the 1951 Monte Carlo Rally. Simon Hoggart was married to his step-daughter and claimed that Goodhart also invented the box junction but was uncredited. He proposed a method of suppressing hurricanes during their formation. His proposal involved covering of ocean with a reflective material using four aircraft, each with a 2 km wingspan. He was persuaded it would not work, so he switched the concept to putting out forest fires. At the age of 88 he raised funds for a hospice near Exeter by abseiling down Cullompton church. Goodhart married Lydia Sward in 1957 and Molly Copsey in 1975. He had three step- children: Alyson, Ian and Fiona.Daily Telegraph Deaths Announcements 15 April 2011 ReferencesSources * External links *\\"RADM H C N 'Nick' Goodhart CB\\" Test & Research Pilots, Flight Test Engineers, 30 May 2008, accessed 3 August 2010. *\\"The Albedo\\", Hurricane Busters, accessed 2 August 2010. * Obituary in The Guardian Category:1919 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Royal Navy officers Category:English test pilots Category:Glider pilots Category:Fleet Air Arm personnel of World War II Category:British World War II pilots Category:Fleet Air Arm aviators Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Foreign recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Fellows of the Royal Aeronautical Society Category:British aviators Category:Glider flight record holders Category:British aviation record holders ","title":"Nicholas Goodhart"},{"id":"20731151","text":"Phillip Elias Areeda (January 28, 1930 ‚Äì December 24, 1995) was an American lawyer and legal scholar.

The model for Harlequin was L√©onide Massine. Picasso painted this work in Barcelona between June and November 1917, with the idea of presenting it at the Liceu Theatre, with the ballet Parade. It is the first work by Picasso to enter the museum collections of Barcelona (Donated by the artist, 1919).Pablo Picasso, 1917, Harlequin, Museo Picasso, Barcelona Pablo Picasso and the Ballets Russes collaborated on several productions. Pablo Picasso's Cubist sets and costumes were used by Sergei Diaghilev in the Ballets Russes's Parade (1917, choreography: L√©onide Massine), Le Tricorne (The Three-Cornered Hat) (1919, choreography: Massine), Pulcinella (1920, choreographer: Massine), and Cuadro Flamenco (1921, choreography: Spanish folk dancers).

Ballet and Modern Dance. London: Thames and Hudson Ltd. 2002. p. 105-106 The idea for the set design of Parade came from the decorations at a small vaudeville theater in Rome as well as the d√©cor of the Teatro dei Piccoli, a marionette theater. The original model was crafted in a cardboard box. Picasso realized immediately that he liked using vivid colors for his sets and costumes because they registered so well with the audience. While the sets, costumes and music by Erik Satie were well received by critics, the ballet in general was panned when it first premiered and played for only two performances. When it was revived in 1920, however, Diaghilev said, \\"Parade is my best bottle of wine. I do not like to open it too often.\\" { Costume design by Pablo Picasso for Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes performance of Parade at Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris, 18 May 1917 Costume design by Pablo Picasso representing skyscrapers and boulevards, for Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes performance of Parade at Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, Paris 18 May 1917 } The writer Jean Cocteau, who introduced Picasso to Diaghilev,Ballets Russes, The Art of Costume, National Gallery of Australia wrote the scenario for Parade, and was Picasso‚Äôs neighbor in Rome said, \\"Picasso amazes me every day, to live near him is a lesson in nobility and hard work ... A badly drawn figure of Picasso is the result of endless well-drawn figures he erases, corrects, covers over, and which serves him as a foundation. In opposition to all schools he seems to end his work with a sketch.\\" Additionally, Guillaume Apollinaire, who wrote the program notes for Parade, described Picasso's designs as \\"a kind of surrealism\\" three years before Surrealism developed as an art movement in Paris.Richard Friswell, \\"Washington's National Gallery of Art with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, 1909‚Äì1929\\", Artes Magazine, June 29, 2013 Pablo Picasso and scene painters sitting on the front cloth for L√©onide Massine's ballet Parade, staged by Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, Paris, 1917 Picasso's sets and costumes for the Ballets Russes are now considered symbols of \\"the progressive art of their time, and [they] have only become more celebrated and better appreciated over the past century.\\" Scene design by Pablo Picasso for Le Tricorne, Harvard Libraries Nevertheless, according to his biographer, John Richardson, \\"Picasso's Cubist followers were horrified that their hero should desert them for the chic, elitist Ballets Russes.\\" Portraits of a Marriage, Vanity Fair It was the onset of World War I that prompted him to leave Paris and live in Rome, where the Ballets Russes rehearsed. He also was recovering from two failed love affairs at this time. Soon after he arrived in Rome, however, he met ballerina Olga Khokhlova, and married her in 1918. He remained married to her until her death in 1955, although they separated by the late 1920s. He also became friends with Massine while in Rome; they were both interested in Spanish themes, women, and modern art. Picasso also became friends with Igor Stravinsky during this time, though he found Diaghilev to be possessive and did not become close to him. Picasso was even quoted as saying that he \\"felt a desperate need to travel back to the land of human beings\\" after spending time with Diaghilev. Diaghilev, however, valued Picasso's work, and the drop curtain he created for Le Train Bleu ‚Äì the painting of which was completed not by Picasso, but by Prince Alexander Schervashidze ‚Äì was deemed so impressive that Diaghilev used it as the logo for the Ballets Russes.

Mammoth Resource Partners, Inc. is majority owned by chief executive officer and founder Dr. Roger L. Cory. Dr. Cory is assisted in the day-to-day management of the company by president and chief operating officer Daniel R. Northcutt. Its litigation problems began almost immediately. These legal issues continued with various private settlements and included a federal trial, alleging various securities violations and fraud. Company information Since inception, Mammoth Resource Partners has completed 73 wells for oil and natural gas. Of the last 40 consecutive drillings, Mammoth Resource Partners has struck producible hydrocarbons in all wells. While Mammoth explored for oil in its first years, today the company focuses almost exclusively on exploration of natural gas. The company employs approximately 30 men and women at its headquarters and field services offices. Mammoth Resource Partners owns or controls the mineral rights to over of Appalachian Basin property and is quickly becoming one of the region's top natural gas producers. Headquarters Mammoth Resource Partners is headquartered in Cave City, Kentucky, which provides relatively close proximity to its of lease and land holdings in the Appalachian Basin.

Mammoth's knowledge of the formations into which it drills allow its crews to minimize the amount of land cleared for drill operations. A typical drill pad will measure approximately 200 by 200 feet, or about 9/10's of an acre. Mammoth has used drill pads as small as 50 by 50 feet when possible. *Erosion and sediment control - During excavation of sites, Mammoth utilizes an array of erosion and sediment control devices. Culverts, silt fences, break dams, and ditches control surface water runoff, and prevent sediment from escaping the site. Proper planning helps Mammoth employ these measures so as to limit the effect its drilling activities has on the environment. *Well spacing - All wells are spaced at a minimum 1,000 feet offset from another well. This minimizes surface impact by disturbing only a small amount of the available land. If Mammoth crews find two or more production zones, they have the potential to use the same well pad to drill a second \\"twin\\" well, as opposed to creating a new location. *Protecting fresh water zones - When drilling an oil or gas well, inevitably fresh water will be encountered. When fresh water is found, casing is set into the well bore. Concrete is circulated down the casing string so that it pushes up between the outside of the casing and the well bore. This concrete holds the casing in place, and prevents water from entering the well or hydrocarbons from being released into the fresh water zone. *Produced water - Generally, an oil or gas well will produce a certain amount of fresh or brine water. These fluids are collectively known as produced water. Produced water contains trace amounts of hydrocarbons and minerals, and is considered hazardous waste. Mammoth stores produced water in holding tanks until it can be picked up by an approved transporter and taken off-site for disposal. *Land reclamation - After drilling and stimulation are complete, land surrounding the well site that will not be needed for daily operations are limed, reseeded, and mulched. This prevents erosion from the drill pad. Proper reclamation of drill sites also allows wildlife to naturally re-introduce to disturbed areas. *Spill prevention - Each site is part of a spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan (SPCC) that is certified by an engineering firm. The SPCC outlines measures that are taken to prevent spills, such as outlining inspection, maintenance, and training schedules; controlling spills through the use of remote impoundments or berms around storage facilities; and steps that will be taken in the event of an accidental discharge. Business ethics Mammoth Resource Partners built its business model around the concept of corporate transparency. Partners in Mammoth projects are given access to a proprietary Partner Communication Systems, which informs them of their project's progress and production in near real time. The Internet data delivery is coupled with monthly letters written by Mammoth President Dr. Roger L. Cory to each Partner reporting that month's project activity in detail.

Several published studies have researched climbing injuries, especially lead climbing injuries and how to avoid them. Chances of neck and head injuries are very low and they can be avoided by falling correctly.  Injuries from falling  Lead falls are dangerous because the climber can fall twice the length of the rope between them and their last piece of protection. Thus, a climber who is 5 feet above their protection will fall 10 feet. The fall can produce significant force on the midsection, where the climbing rope is tied to their harness. Injuries from falling come in many forms. They range from mild skin abrasions to death. As rock climbing has become more popular, several studies have been published documenting the frequency and severity of injuries sustained by rock climbers in various circumstances.see A Prospective Study of Rock Climbing Injuries, Rope Tangling Injuries--How Should a Climber Fall? and Rock-Climbing Injuries in Yosemite National Park. Each study provides slightly different information due to the differences in methods in obtaining data. One problem with all of the studies is that injuries are not always reported; therefore, it is difficult to determine how many climbers were actually injured because there is no way to determine how many climbers climbed in the given areas during the times the studies were conducted.  A Prospective Study of Rock Climbing Injuries  A Prospective Study of Rock Climbing Injuries, a study performed by Jonathon P. Wyatt, Gordon W. McNaughton, and Patrick T. Grant, registrars and consultants at the Accident and Emergency Department of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary surveyed patients from 1992-93 who checked in with climbing related injuries. While this study greatly lacked subjects, percentages of injuries to various body parts are consistent with studies which reported more injuries. According to patients, 18 of 19 climbing-related injuries were directly caused by climbing falls. No distinction was made whether the falls were lead falls or not, but 15 climbers fell from the rock face to the ground, implying these were lead falls. Twelve of the 19 injures sustained were bone fractures, including feet, shins, pelvis and lower back. The remaining seven were soft tissue injuries (ankle, knee, and ligaments). Ten injuries were to the lower extremities (legs and pelvic areas). These included three ankle injuries, three fractures of bones in the calf (tibia and fibula), and two lumbar spine fractures. Most importantly, none of the injuries were neck injuries.  Falling correctly  Breaking one‚Äôs neck can be avoided if a climber learns how to fall correctly. Volker Sch√∂ffl and Tomas K√ºpper of Germany reviewed many reports of injuries caused by climbers who grabbed something as they fell. They analyzed the information and determined the best way to fall. They found that climbers who grabbed the ascending rope occasionally sustained skin damage (from rope burns) on their hands, became caught in the last piece of protection, unclipped the belay point causing longer and more dangerous falls, and became tangled in the rope. They also found that climbers who grab their ropes above the tying knot might have their fingers amputated by the rope constricting around them. The authors also mention it is detrimental to grab pieces of protection as a climber falls because such piece could impale the climber's hand. While these injuries happen, the authors imply they did not happen often. However, someone who climbs 3-4 days a week might take 1000 lead falls a year. With that in mind, Sch√∂ffl and K√ºpper suggest climbers should fall with their hands up and slightly forward and with feet down and slightly forward as well. They explain that this method of falling would allow the climber to make contact with the wall with limbs that can absorb force, rather than with other less-absorbent parts of the body. After impact, Sch√∂ffl and K√ºpper instruct the climber to grab the rope (it is completely stretched out and unable to cause injury) in order to refrain from tipping upside down. This method of falling will eliminate injuries caused by prematurely grabbing the rope or other pieces of protection, as well as virtually eliminating neck injuries.  Rock climbing injuries in Yosemite National Park  In a 3¬Ω-year study performed in Yosemite National Park, California, William S. Bowie, Thomas K. Hunt, and Hubert A. Allen reviewed 451 injuries reported by 220 climbers. These injuries came from a variety of sources, but 144 climbers were injured in lead falls (65.45%). Research was compiled as climbers were brought to the Yosemite Medical Clinic or were rescued by United States National Park Search and Rescue team. All injured climbers filled out a survey of their injuries. Nearly 227 of the 451 injuries reported were to the skin or subcutaneous tissue (the layer of fat between skin and underlying tissues). Of the remaining injuries, 127 were to lower extremities including femur, knee, tibia/fibula, ankle, and foot. Twenty-nine were to upper extremities including shoulder, forearm, wrist, and hand. Twenty-five injuries were reported to the skull/brain. Of the remaining injuries, ten were sustained by face and neck area. This study also showed that falls are not the cause of injury; it depends on how the climber lands after the falls. The contact surface and shape determines the severity and type of their injuries. For example, in one case of injury a woman fell 100 feet and only suffered a small laceration and minimal contusions. This is attributed to the fact that she hit no rocks during her fall and the rope decelerated her elastically. Conversely, in another case, a climber fell only 6 feet but hit a sharp ledge and suffered a compound fracture of his femur. In a third case, a climber fell 20 feet but hit the ground and suffered a concussion, rib fractures, and dislocated ankle. Thus, injury severity is likely and more determined by the shape of the rock hit, the angle of impact, and which body surface hit the rock, as opposed to the length of the fall. This study importantly points out there were a total of thirty-five head and neck-related injuries. Only four injuries related to lead climbing were fatal‚Äîall of these were head injuries. However, only 7% of total injuries reported were head injuries. Thus, it is unlikely a climber will break their neck when climbing.  Conclusion  Each of the studies discussed the effects of falling, and How Should a Climber Fall? also taught the best way to fall especially to avoid head and neck injuries. The Yosemite study points out that injury usually is not related to the distance of the fall nor the frequency of falls: it depends more on the rock surface the climber hits. In reviewing these studies of climbing injuries, and focusing mainly on lead climbing injuries, it is apparent that the chance of major injury is relatively slim, that potential injuries to the head and neck are more slim, and that minor injuries, though more common, seem to be infrequent as well.

In particular, physical activity is controlled so that its intensity cannot threaten the body‚Äôs homeostasis by causing anoxic damage to the heart muscle. The central governor limits exercise by reducing the neural recruitment of muscle fibers. This reduced recruitment causes the sensation of fatigue. The existence of a central governor was suggested to explain fatigue after prolonged strenuous exercise in long-distance running and other endurance sports, but its ideas could also apply to other causes of exertion-induced fatigue. The existence of a central governor was proposed by Tim Noakes in 1997, but a similar idea was suggested in 1924 by Archibald Hill. In contrast to this idea is the one that fatigue is due to peripheral ‚Äòlimitation‚Äô or ‚Äòcatastrophe‚Äô. In this view, regulation by fatigue occurs as a consequence of a failure of homeostasis directly in muscles.  History  Archibald Hill = The 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner Archibald Hill proposed in 1924 that the heart was protected from anoxia in strenuous exercise by the existence of a governor. This hypothesis was disregarded and further research upon exercise fatigue was modeled in terms of it being due to a mechanical failure of the exercising muscles (\\"peripheral muscle fatigue\\"). This failure was caused either by an inadequate oxygen supply to the exercising muscles, lactic acid buildup, or total energy depletion in the exhausted muscles.Edwards RHT. (1983) Biochemical bases for fatigue in exercise performance: catastrophe theory in muscular fatigue. In: Biochemistry of exercise. Knuttgen HG, Vogel JA, Poortmans J, eds. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics, 1‚Äì28. = Tim Noakes = Tim Noakes, a professor of exercise and sports science at the University of Cape Town, in 1997 has renewed Hill‚Äôs argument on the basis of modern research. In his approach, the power output by muscles during exercise is continuously adjusted in regard to calculations made by the brain in regard to a safe level of exertion. These neural calculations factor in earlier experience with strenuous exercise, the planning duration of the exercise, and the present metabolic state of the body. These brain models ensure that body homeostasis is protected, and an emergency reserve margin is maintained. This neural control adjusts the number of activated skeletal muscle motor units, a control which is subjectively experienced as fatigue. This process, though occurring in the brain, is outside conscious control.  Other uses  Noakes created the idea of the central governor in the context of prolonged endurance running. However, he has noted that the central processes involved might also underlie the existence of other kinds of fatigue: In support of this, placebos (which must be mediated by a central process) have a powerful effect upon not only fatigue in prolonged exercise, but also upon short term endurance exercise such as sprint speed, the maximum weight that could be lifted with leg extension, and the tolerance of ischemic pain and power when a tourniqueted hand squeezes a spring exerciser 12 times.  Criticisms  The existence of a central governor over physiology has been questioned since ‚Äòphysiological catastrophes‚Äô can and do occur in athletes (important examples in marathons have been Dorando Pietri, Jim Peters and Gabriela Andersen-Schiess). This suggests that humans can over-ride ‚Äòthe central governor‚Äô. Moreover, a variety of peripheral factors in addition to those such as lactic acid build up can impair muscle power and might act to protect against \\"catastrophe\\". Another objection is that models incorporating conscious control also provide an alternative explanation (see Noakes‚Äô reply). Exercise fatigue has also been attributed to the direct effects of exercise upon the brain such as increased cerebral levels of serotonin, reduced level of glutamate secondary to uptake of ammonia in the brain, brain hyperthermia, and glycogen depletion in brain cells.

Ralph W. 'Bud' Leavitt Jr. (January 13, 1917 ‚Äì December 20, 1994) was a Maine newspaperman who was executive sports editor of the Bangor Daily News, and a longtime outdoor columnist recognized statewide. In addition to his writing, Leavitt hosted one of Maine's earliest television shows, which was devoted to fishing, hunting and the out-of-doors. Leavitt's stature within the state was such that columnist Roy Blount Jr. wrote of the Maine sportswriter that he \\"fishes with Ted Williams and Red Smith - or, rather, they trout-fish with him.\\" An early conservationist and son of a paper mill union leader, Leavitt urged the state of Maine to acquire lands for public use; one such preserve is today named for the sportswriter and television personality. Early life and career beginnings Ralph W. Leavitt Jr. was born in Old Town, Maine, on January 13, 1917 to Ralph W. Leavitt Sr., union manager at Penobscot Chemical Fiber Company, and his wife Elise. Following graduation from Old Town High School, Leavitt went to work in the plant where his father was manager of the union - and quit the next day. \\"He didn't like getting all covered with dirt and sweat anywhere but on the athletic field,\\" said Leavitt's cousin Alden Leavitt. Following his one-day career in the industrial world, Leavitt went looking for other employment. He landed his first newspaper job at age 17 when he began writing for The Bangor Daily Commercial in 1934. At the outbreak of World War II, Leavitt joined the Army Air Corps as a civilian employee. Following the War, in 1946 Leavitt took a job as general sportswriter at The Bangor Daily News, with which he associated as sportswriter, sports editor and outdoor columnist for the next 48 years. Leavitt's retirement from his Maine newspaper duties was considered noteworthy enough that Maine Senator George J. Mitchell issued a statement about it. During his tenure as sports editor and outdoor columnist, Leavitt also occasionally filed stories to national publications, including TIME Magazine. High school graduate Leavitt's prose on sporting topics even turned up occasionally in the highbrow The New Yorker magazine. In its issue of June 25, 1979, The New Yorker quoted at length from sportswriter Leavitt's essay on fishing in Maine. \\"He wrote when the fog shuts out the land, it is like a pussy-footing cat laying down a paw,\\" wrote the magazine, paraphrasing Leavitt's prose. Even Leavitt's admirers concede the columnist and sportswriter wasn't known for his adept turns of phrase. Some observers attributed his popularity in Maine to his no-nonsense, somewhat gruff style, in which he delivered the facts without embroidery. Leavitt also frequently hunted and fished with his friend Nelson Bryant, outdoor columnist for The New York Times, who wrote about their jaunts in his newspaper. During this time, Leavitt began to make himself indispensable to the Bangor newspaper, where the owners noted that his presence on the sports pages came to embody for many readers the newspaper itself. In 1948 Leavitt began writing a daily outdoor column for the newspaper in addition to his sportswriter duties. The column, in which Leavitt discussed hunting and fishing and life in Maine, ran in The Bangor Daily News until November 30, 1994 - six years after Leavitt had retired as the paper's sports editor, and only weeks before the columnist's death from cancer. The columnist and the television host Leavitt hosted one of the first outdoor shows on national television. In 1953 Maine's first TV station went on the air, and asked Leavitt to anchor a show on the themes he wrote about in his column. The Bud Leavitt Show debuted that year as one of the first local programs on the air in Maine. For the next 20 years Leavitt appeared every Saturday night to talk about the pressing issues of a Maine outdoorsman: how to remove a fishhook; the death of a favorite dog; snoeshowing and moose hunting and salmon fishing. There was little that Bud Leavitt wouldn't fish for. When the salmon runs on the rivers of Maine and New Brunswick tapered off, Leavitt often took to the rips off Maine's Petit Manan Light, where he cast a fly to schools of 25-pound pollock. New Brunswick's Miramichi River. Favorite fishing destination of Leavitt. That Leavitt's newspaper permitted him to appear on a competing news outlet startled no one. \\"They had to have him,\\" said Bangor Daily News managing editor Mike Dowd of the demand for the popular columnist. \\"He had to have it. So [Leavitt] became multimedia before the term was invented.\\" Leavitt's last show on local Maine television was taped in 1973, but in 1978 the Maine Public Broadcasting Network asked the sportswriter to host a new show. Leavitt's early broadcasts on Maine's TV airwaves were marked by the times. The balding, avuncular Leavitt closed each show with the homily, 'Remember, the family that plays together stays together.' And the show's trademark music jingle is still the subject of Mainers posting to internet message boards, recalling Saturday night with beans and biscuits, watching 'Bud' Leavitt. That show, called Woods and Waters, went on to become a public TV sensation. Within a year it was broadcast nationally. The Outdoor Writers of America later rated it the nation's best outdoor-oriented program. The show's success launched the local Maine sportswriter into the national consciousness: Leavitt was featured as a guest several times on the ABC show American Sportsman, and was a frequent guest on national radio programs. Sometimes Leavitt was joined on his Maine TV show by friends like broadcaster Curt Gowdy, or baseball players Brooks Robinson or Ted Williams. \\"He was to outdoor journalism what Norman Rockwell was to art,\\" wrote longtime Bangor Daily News sports columnist Larry Mahoney. The comparison was apt. Leavitt was not known for his eloquent turns-of- phrase, but for his directness and lack of artifice‚Äîwhat some might call his 'Maine-ness.' Thanks to his notoriety, Leavitt kept a running correspondence with people that he might never have met. His friendship with Albany, New York mayor Erastus Corning 2nd, for instance, lasted decades, and the pair's letters about angling are among the papers collected in Corning's archives. Leavitt's friendship with baseball player Ted Williams spanned decades, and the two were frequent fishing buddies. Leavitt had been sent to Boston's Fenway Park in 1939 to write about the Boston Red Sox, where he met Williams, then a first-year rookie already making a name for himself as a slugger. Overhearing that the cub sportswriter was from Maine, Williams asked about the fishing up north. A lifelong friendship ensued. \\"One journalist with whom Williams had a genuine friendship was the late Bud Leavitt, former sports editor and outdoor writer for the Bangor Daily News,\\" wrote Tony Chamberlain of The Boston Globe. \\"Leavitt fished often with Williams in the lakes and streams of Maine and Canada. Most of their fishing up north was for salmon, and Williams fished with Leavitt near the writer's home along the Penobscot River.' Recognition in Maine and later years Leavitt's stature as a writer on some of Maine's favorite topics, and his weekly television presence made him one of the state's celebrities - in the days when the words 'Maine' and 'celebrity' were oxymorons. Once, on a bird hunting drive in northern Maine with his friends Curt Gowdy and Brooks Robinson, Leavitt got lost. He stopped at a local home where he saw several men talking in the driveway. After inquiring after directions, Leavitt gestured at his car. Did the local Mainers know either of the two men in his automobile, Leavitt asked the group. \\"No, we don't\\", answered one man, \\"but we sure know who you are. You're Bud Leavitt!\\" Even Maine Senator Edmund Muskie tested the limits of political muscle when he brushed against Leavitt's following. It was arranged for Muskie to go ice- fishing with Leavitt‚Äîor as Muskie adviser Clyde MacDonald Jr. put it, \\"possibly the greatest political event that could be arranged at that time.\\" MacDonald lived next to columnist Leavitt, whom the Muskie aide inveigled to accompany Muskie on a fishing trip to an Ellsworth, Maine, lake. Muskie landed the prize-winning fish, headlined in the next day's Bangor newspaper. As Muskie recalled, his fishing trip with Leavitt made a deeper impression than most of his electoral efforts. \\"Muskie throughout the rest of his career would say, 'You know, I fought for Dickey-Lincoln [Dam], and I prevented them from closing Loring, but the thing that people talk about is that fish.'\\" Leavitt died on December 20, 1994, and his funeral mass was held in Bangor, not far from his home in Hampden, Maine, on December 26, 1994. His wife Barbara had predeceased him, dying five years prior in 1989. During his career, Leavitt wrote 13,104 columns for Maine newspapers, and a book called, simply, Twelve Months in Maine. Leavitt's essay most often collected in outdoor writing anthologies is \\"Hunting for Grouse and Woodcock\\" from his book Twelve Months in Maine. Following his death, the State of Maine named the Bud Leavitt Wildlife Management Area, of upland forest northwest of Bangor, in honor of the sportswriter, a longtime advocate for conservation and public lands. In 2000, six years after Leavitt's death, the Maine Press Association posthumously inducted Leavitt into its Hall of Fame. Leavitt is interred, alongside his wife Barbara, at Lakeview Cemetery in Hampden, Maine. Works * Bud Leavitt and Senator William S.

He is a founding member of the Canadian hip hop crew Backburner. He currently resides in his hometown of Toronto, Ontario.  Career  More Or Les' interest in hip hop culture began as a DJ, learning to mix at the age of 11 with the help of his older brother Colin. As a first year student at Woburn Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, Ontario, Les began freestyling with other local emcees and performing regularly at school assemblies. It was around this time that Les created the emcee name for himself, and started to produce beats. In 2001, More Or Les became one of the resident DJ's at Toronto's longest running open mic night known as In Divine Style. It was at this event where Les met and began working on music with several members of the Toronto Hip Hop community including Dorc, Vangel and the Wordburglar. These connections led to the release of his first album I only stop for the Red Ants in 2003. Les used the revenue generated from this version to release a \\"shrinkwrap edition\\" in 2004, a version with remastered tracks including a bonus song and a music video for the song A Little Too Much Weed. While deemed \\"too controversial\\" for airplay on MuchMusic, the video has been shown on the Bravo program Richler Ink and received an award from the Next Festival in 2004, honouring the year's most innovative international videos. To further promote the album, Les not only performed at \\"regular\\" music venues, but also began busking on downtown Toronto streets, becoming a mainstay on Queen West on weekends for several years. In 2005, More Or Les met and performed with UK Hip Hop band The Herbaliser. This meeting has led to subsequent touring in Canada and Europe with the band, and recorded appearances on their album Same As It Never Was, released in 2008. More Or Les has since released a second album The Truth About Rap in 2006, featuring several artists he has since been affiliated with, including the Wordburglar and Rhythmicru. This album has also been well received by critics, cited as one of the Top 10 Hip Hop releases of 2006 by Exclaim!, with songs receiving regular airplay on CBC Radio 3. In late summer 2009, More Or Les collaborated with Backburner crew producer Fresh Kils and DJ Uncle Fester to release The Les Kils EP. Meeting rave reviews from press, the EP debuted on Canadian college radio at #1. The song Pop N Chips has been played in high rotation on CBC Radio 3, with a music video for the release that has received play on Canadian channels MuchMusic and MusiquePlus. In the latter half of October 2010, More Or Les released his third full length release Brunch with a Vengeance on Fuzzy Logic Recordings. Featuring a number of local artists and an additional collaboration with The Herbaliser, Les' new project is a concept album, compiling a list of various complaints from fans, friends and family and turning them into songs. In addition to the latest project, More Or Les continues to be a co-host of Hip Hop Karaoke in Toronto (with DJs Dalia, Numeric, Ted Dancin' and co-host Abdominal), an event started in 2006. In 2020, he and Peter Chapman received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Original Song for \\"We Run the World\\", from the film Riot Girls.

He previously lived in Oregon (from 1957‚Äì2002), and is the biggest political contributor in the history of that state. He has financed numerous ballot measure initiative petitions and campaigns since the mid-1990s. He has also contributed heavily to races for prominent offices by his attorney, Kevin Mannix, a frequent chief petitioner of ballot campaigns. Early life Parks was born in Wichita, Kansas in 1926. He served in the military from 1944‚Äì1946. He has a BA in psychology, having studied at five different universities. He speaks several languages. Parks later started a business while living in Aloha, Oregon. He founded Parks Medical Electronics in 1961. The business sells a number of instruments, including a plethysmograph, which measures the blood flow to sexual organs and is used in treating sexual dysfunction and assessing the arousal of sex offenders. Influential in Oregon politics From 1996 to 2006, Parks contributed over $6 million to various political campaigns ‚Äì far more than any other individual, and more than most organized lobbies. His entry into backing political concerns followed the passage of Ballot Measure 5 in 1990. His support was instrumental in launching Oregon Taxpayers United, according to executive director Bill Sizemore. Parks' dominance of the ballot measure system has been said to undermine the grassroots intent of the system. In 2001, a former employee filed a sexual harassment complaint and lawsuit against Parks. Parks moved from Oregon to Henderson, Nevada in 2002. Parks made contributions to uphold the Oregon Death with Dignity Act in 1997. Parks has been a strong supporter of former state legislator and gubernatorial candidate Kevin Mannix. Mannix has served as Parks' attorney. Parks' staff once said: \\"Mr. Parks thinks Kevin is one of the few leaders who keeps his word and gets things done.\\" Parks has not indiscriminately backed Mannix's proposed measures. In 2008, for instance, he declined to fund a proposed initiative that would have allowed for expanded local regulation of strip clubs. As a result, Mannix stopped pursuing ballot qualification. In 2008, Parks was the source of over half the money used to qualify ballot measures for the statewide ballot. None of the measures he supported in that year was successful. Parks is also a major contributor to charitable organizations, including health care and environmental concerns. Parks is not religious, but is a believer in faith healing. In March 2014, Parks gave a $30,000 donation to Greg Barreto (R) of Cove, OR towards his campaign for Oregon State Assembly. That donation was returned in April.

Yangpachen Gompa was founded by Murab Jampa Tujepel in 1490 under the auspices of the fourth Sharmapa and financed by the Prince of Rinpung. It was the residence of the Sharmapas for only 300 years.... When the Gorkhalis under Pritvi Narayan Shah, king of the newly unified Kingdom of Nepal, invaded Tibet in 1792 to be defeated by a Chinese army, the tenth Sharmapa was accused of traitorous support of the Nepalis.

Szkic do portretu epoki, (Warsaw, 1999): Polish Literature of Enlightenment The carol was published for the first time in a compilation of Karpi≈Ñski‚Äôs works entitled Pie≈õni nabo≈ºne (Songs of Piety) in 1792.Hymn About the Birth of the Lord - analysis and interpretation The book was printed by the Basilian monks printing shop in Supra≈õl.Spirit of Suprasl However, the hymn had been publicly presented already a few years earlier, in the Old Basilica in Bia≈Çystok, as Karpi≈Ñski lived in Bia≈Çystok‚Äôs Branicki Palace in the years from 1785 to 1818.Radio Bialystok First presentation of the carol is now commemorated by a tablet, located on the wall of the church. The tablet reads: In this church, for the first time ever, Songs of Piety by Franciszek Karpi≈Ñski were performed. The original title of the carol is Pie≈õ≈Ñ o Narodzeniu Pa≈Ñskim (On God's Nativity or Song of the birth of our LordPolish Literature of Enlightenment ). Structure The carol consists of five verses, each verse with eight lines, and each line with eight syllables. The hymn can be characterized as a rhetorical tautology, which is visible while analyzing the text (God is born, power is trembling: Lord of the Heaven bared/exposed. Fire‚Äôs congealing/solidifying, lucence/resplendence is darkening, the infinite/endless one has limits/boundaries). These apparently oxymoronic figures of speech are used deliberately, to emphasize the importance of the miracle which took place in the shed. Lyrics of the carol are also supported by quotation from the Gospel of John (Word-Turned-Flesh to prove the Story, lived among us, born of Heaven). Additionally, Karpi≈Ñski inserted a patriotic message, as the fifth verse begins with an appeal to Baby Jesus (Raise Your hand now, Child of Glory, bless our homeland now and ever). \\"B√≥g siƒô rodzi\\" was the carol on which Pope John Paul II based his talk during the traditional exchange of Christmas greetings on 23 December 1996 at the Paul VI Auditorium.\\"Christmas carols have shaped our history\\", Pope John Paul II The Pope cited the words of the hymn saying, \\"The poet presented the mystery of the Incarnation of God's Son, using contrasts to express what is essential to the mystery: in assuming human nature, the infinite God at the same time assumed the limitations of a creature\\". The hymn has been performed by several popular Polish artists, including Anna Maria Jopek, Violetta Villas, Micha≈Ç Bajor, Krzysztof Krawczyk and Eleni Tzoka. It was sung by Polish prisoners of the Auschwitz concentration camp; an account by an inmate named Jozef Jedrych, kept in the Auschwitz Museum collections, describes how \\"the singing of German carols began, and then like the waves of the sea came the powerful words [from a Polish carol] ‚ÄòGod is born, the powers tremble‚Äô.\\"Christmas Eve in Auschwitz as Recalled by Polish Prisoners. Internet Archive. =In popular culture= An instrumental rendition of this song is featured in the \\"Brave New World\\" expansion pack of Civilization V.

His internationally renowned work includes iconic designs for filmmakers like Pedro Almod√≥var, Alex de la Iglesia, and Julio M√©dem, musicians like Bruce Springsteen, The Psychedelic Furs or Brian Eno, the press (El Pa√≠s, C International Photo Magazine) and a variety of firms (Absolut Vodka, Hugo Boss, Camper, LoeweLVMH The Magazine, Published on July 22, 2004, checked 04-04-2010 etc.) He is the founder of OMB Graphic Design studio in Madrid. Biography Oscar Marin√© Brandi (born 1951 in Madrid, Spain) Marin√© has produced dozens of works of national and international renown in areas as diverse as publishing, corporate communications, film and music. His works bear the precious seal of a total creator, one who unites content, context and various techniques to overcome barriers in graphic design.Chair design at bonluxat, checked 04-04-2010 His organic conception of product design makes him a vital exemplar of contemporary communication methods. In 1998, Tibor Kalman said of Marin√©'s work: \\"It is no longer graphic design. It is communication. Graphic belongs to 1955. Communication means the creator has accepted responsibility for an intense stew of elements (a paella?) which now includes nutrition. Good cooks must balance the full range of effects to be expected from communications and now this includes content, as well as a dizzying array of contents, media and techniques. =Early days - Madrid Me Mata magazine (1980s)= Marin√©'s multidisciplinary creativity was evident from the start when he was founder and artistic director of the celebrated counter-cultural magazine Madrid Me Mata, where he fused content and form to create an iconic publication during the famed La Movida Madrile√±a of the 1980s. =As a graphic designer/communicator (1991 to date)= In the area of branding, his projects for Camper, Loewe and Vega Sicilia are well known in Spanish design circles. International achievements include the renowned US advertising campaign for Absolut Vodka Absolut Marin√© for Seagram USA, his work for Swatch, Benetton's Fabrica and the Japanese Narizuka Corporation. Also the development of the brand for Sir Norman Foster's architectural studio in London, Foster and Partners, where his concepts remit one to the aesthetics of London in the swinging '60s. He has an extensive portfolio of editorial projects, and in the world of journalism, in 2007, the Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s entrusted his studio with the design of their leading editions. The El Pa√≠s Semanal (the Sunday glossy magazine) has recovered its original name, Babelia (the Saturday newspaper's cultural review) has totally transformed its contents. Domingo (the Sunday newspaper's current affairs section) provides in-depth journalism for the weekend. He has also supervised the overall redesign of the daily newspaper, altering typographic protocols, and giving the content legibility, readability and credibility. Since 2005 Marin√© is responsible for the art direction of the exquisite design of the C International Photo Magazine, undoubtedly the most prestigious photographic art magazine in the world published by IvoryPress, London. Many musicians have requested Marin√©'s input in the creation of their album covers: Bruce Springsteen, Immaculate Fools, The Psychedelic Furs, Andr√©s Calamaro, Los Rodr√≠guez, Brian Eno, Kevin Ayers, Siniestro Total, Michel Camilo and Tomatito to name just a few. His projects for film include iconic posters for All About My Mother by Pedro Almod√≥var, The Day of the Beast by Alex de la Iglesia, and Tierra by Julio M√©dem. This connection with cinema continues with designs for film festivals such as Zinebi International Festival of Documentary and Short Films of Bilbao (Spain), where Marin√©'s poster was awarded the New York Art Directors Club Award for 2000. He also designed the official look for the last two editions of the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival (Spain) and all of its sections. His Federico Garc√≠a Lorca-like designs are featured in the scenery of the renowned flamenco dancer Eva Yerbabuena's show El huso de la memoria. =Current work= Recent projects include the brand for Madrid's new cultural center, Matadero Madrid.

In the El Greco 1900 exhibition organised by the SEACEX (State Corporation for Spanish Cultural Action Abroad) with paintings from the archives of the Museo de El Greco in Toledo, Spain, Marin√© achieves a global vision of exhibition design, architecture, illumination, graphics and catalogue. The innovative lighting of the paintings and the installation that allows us to enter the famed The Burial of the Count of Orgaz piece has been defined by critics as a radiant and avant-garde vision, without falling for typical stereotypes.El Pa√≠s, 03/02/2010 (checked 04/02/2010) Inaugurated at the Palacio de Bellas Artes museum in Mexico DF in 2009, it continues itinerant during 2010 at the Bozar Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels. =As an artist (1991 to date)= Marin√©'s pictorial work has been the subject of solo exhibitions in Tokyo, New York, Milan, Venice, Bologna, Madrid and Ibiza, and also forms a part of many collective shows.

DOOR syndrome is characterized by mental retardation, sensorineural deafness, abnormal nails and phalanges of the hands and feet, and variable seizures. A similar deafness-onychodystrophy syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait and has no mental retardation. Some authors have proposed that it may be the same as Eronen Syndrome, but since both disorders are extremely rare it is hard to make a determination.  Signs and symptoms  Not all of the DOOR symptoms are consistently present. They can vary in severity, and additional features can be noted in individuals affected by DOOR syndrome. Some of these additional features are: * Polyhydramnios (increased amniotic fluid during pregnancy) and increased nuchal fold during pregnancy * Specific facial features such as a large nose * Severe and sometimes refractory seizures, abnormalities on the magnetic resonance imaging of the brain * Increased 2-oxoglutaric acid in the blood and urine - this compound is made or used by several enzymes * Finger-like thumbs * Visual impairment * Peripheral neuropathy (nerves conducting sensation from extremities to the brain) and insensivity to pain Intellectual impairment is present in all reported cases, but the severity can vary widely. The prognosis in terms of survival also varies greatly from early childhood till adulthood.  Cause  The recurrence of DOOR in siblings and the finding of DOOR syndrome in a few families with consanguinity suggest that the condition is an autosomal recessive genetic condition.

The UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project is 1 of approximately 24 student-run clinic programs in the nation; students plan, manage, and carry out clinic operations under the supervision of licensed physicians. The UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project seeks to provide high-quality and comprehensive care to uninsured and underserved patients throughout San Diego, who cannot otherwise afford access to care; the majority of patients are working poor. Its four clinics are located at the First Lutheran Church in Downtown San Diego, the Pacific Beach United Methodist Church in Pacific Beach, Baker Elementary School located just north of National City, and Golden Avenue Elementary School in Lemon Grove. History Students at the UCSD School of Medicine had wanted to start a free clinic for many years however, the models initially proposed did not gain the support of UCSD administration. One day, a UCSD pre-med student who had served at the Suitcase Clinic in Berkeley, California approached Dr. Ellen Beck, M.D, Clinical Professor in the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at UCSD. Together, they called a meeting of interested students and formed a planning committee. The key learning for the team was that an exclusive building was not needed to house the clinic; the project needed an established community partner that could provide them with support and facilities. The team identified a well established program already serving the homeless at the Pacific Beach United Methodist Church. Mary Mahy, a formerly homeless woman, had created the Harvest for the Hungry program and was receptive to the idea of a free medical clinic. With her support and assistance, the UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project gained access to several rooms in the church that they could use during the evenings. Thus, the first UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic site was opened at the Pacific Beach United Methodist Church on in January 1997. On that first night, 10 patients came seeking aid and over the next few months the clinic became very busy. A minister from the First Lutheran Church in Downtown San Diego, who was passionate about social justice and serving the homeless, heard about the free clinic that had started in Pacific Beach. He approached Dr. Beck and asked if a second site could be started at his church. This coincided with rising student interest for the project and with a sufficient number of medical student volunteers, a second site was opened in October 1997. The medical students then became interested in reaching out to underserved minority populations. Initially, Dr. Beck approached an inner city church. Though the congregation was primarily middle-class, the pastor of the church referred Dr. Beck to his wife, Dr. Louilyn Hargett, who was the leader at Baker Elementary School. Dr. Hargett along with the school's principal, Krisi Dean, welcomed the creation of a clinic and became partners with the UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project. During 1998, the San Diego Unified School District approved the request to use school buildings for a medical clinic. It was the school board's hope that the clinic would help to affirm the idea that school was at the center of the community. On October 13, 1998, the UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project's third site was opened at Baker Elementary. Through the first 10 years of operations, the clinics provided no- cost healthcare to 7,500 people. At any given time, the clinics have approximately 2,500 active patients. The clinic funding comes from UCSD, grants, foundations, and donors. Nationwide impact The UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project created a national faculty development program in 1999 called, \\"Addressing the Health Needs of the Underserved\\" with grant funding. Over 107 faculty from 30 states have visited UCSD for three week periods to learn the mechanics of creating similar student-run free clinic programs in their communities. The UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project now offers an Advanced Skills Program, in which previous participants return for a week and continue to learn from each other and their programs. Through \\"Addressing the Health Needs of the Underserved,\\" and individual consultations, the UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project Project has been emulated around the country In addition, attendees have used information from the program to create 29 new resident curricula in community medicine, 18 new medical student curricula, successful grant proposals that address training in underserved communities, and new programs addressing the needs of migrant workers, street homeless, and other underserved groups.

The rector was also the founder of the Friern Barnet Grammar School for Girls (c. 1891) and commissioned the imposing St John‚Äôs church building opposite the boys' school. This was a late work in the Gothic Revival style by eminent architect John Loughborough Pearson (whose works include Truro Cathedral and St John's Cathedral, Brisbane) begun in 1890 and completed by his son Frank in 1911. Reverend Hall had been curate at Pearson's St. Augustine's, Kilburn.The Buildings of England - London 4: North, Bridget Cherry & Nikolaus Pevsner, 1998: p131 & The Dictionary of Art, Jane Turner,1996: p307 On the site of the school was the original temporary iron construction known as the school-church of St. John, where both classes and church services were held. This was later replaced by a one-storey building enlarged in the 1950s and the existing building, a two-storeyed block, was built in 1973. After 1890 the establishment was known as Friern Barnet Grammar School for Boys having its own preparatory school from 1904. However the school was never populated by more than two hundred pupils. The school‚Äôs charitable arm was the subsidiary group, Friends of Friern Barnet Grammar School.http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk In 1995, Friern Barnet Grammar became the Senior Department of Woodside Park School, rebranded and began admitting girls.

Polysius is active around the world, constructing, installing and managing cement and ore processing plants. In spring 1859, master machinist Andreas Ernst Gottfried Polysius opened his own workshop in Dessau, thereby laying the foundations for Polysius AG. In 1870, he set up the G. Polysius iron foundry and engineering works, which soon became a designer and manufacturer of mills for the burgeoning construction materials industry. By 1890, the founder's heirs were working on the company's 100th mill contract. From that time onwards, Polysius specialised in machines for crushing, grinding and dressing/processing raw materials, as well as in the construction of cement works. In 1898, the company built Europe's first rotary kiln and in 1907 constructed a complete cement factory in Egypt. In the late 1920s, Georg Lellep invented the LEPOL process. This revolutionised conventional cement production, significantly improving the burning process in the rotary kiln and reducing fuel consumption by a third. In 1946, after the Second World War, Polysius made a fresh start in Dessau. At the same time, Curt Pr√ºssing, a member of the Polysius family, formed Westpol GmbH in Beckum. Three years later, the company was renamed Polysius GmbH. Business quickly picked up, especially exports. Ten years after the new start, Polysius employed 600 people in Germany and 100 abroad. In 1971, the Essen-based company Fried. Krupp GmbH acquired a majority share- holding in Polysius. In 1992, Polysius AG was integrated into the Krupp Plant Construction Division of Fried.

It was founded in 1859.Isaac E. Lambert; 1941. The Public Accepts: Stories Behind Famous Trade-marks, Names and Slogans. University of New Mexico Press. Robert Augustus Chesebrough, a chemist who started the company, was interested in marketing oil products for medicinal needs. He produced the first petroleum jelly by refining rod wax through the use of heat and filtration. He named Vaseline from the German language word for water (Wasser) and the Greek language word for oil (olion). Vaseline was patented in the United States in 1872 and England in 1877. Company history In 1870, Robert Chesebrough began selling a product derived from petroleum residue, Vaseline Petroleum Jelly. Chesebrough's first manufacturing plant for vaseline was in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. In 1881, Chesebrough Manufacturing began operating under Standard Oil. With the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, it regained independence. Additional production sites were built in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and in 1924, London, England. Chesebrough Manufacturing Company distributed its product throughout the United States and Britain during the early and mid-20th century. Its UK office was at 42 Holborn Viaduct. It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and grouped with other oil-related stocks such as Standard Oil and its subsidiaries, and Continental Oil. Saturday, 19 October 2019 The company had a productive record of earnings and dividend disbursements even with the onset of the Great Depression. Earnings increased from $8.36 per share in 1925 to $13.22 during 1929. As of December 31, 1940, the Chesebrough Manufacturing Company had total assets of $4,267,940 and liabilities of $603,643. In 1940, damage to its London plant from a World War II air raid totaled $50,000. Chesebrough and Pond's Creams merged in June 1955, and in 1987 Chesebrough-Ponds was acquired by the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever.

Critical reception  In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said the second side on Three or Four Shades of Blue was \\"the best composed bebop\\" he had heard in 1977, partly because Coryell and Fortune gave their most impressive performances in some time.

Each participant wears an eye maskA specially modified REM Dreamer which detects Rapid Eye Movement. When a mask detects the participant is in REM - and is therefore probably dreaming - the participant is played a short sound clip through speakers embedded in his or her sleep pod.Paul Bignell, \\"The stuff of dreams\\", The Independent, 23 November 2008, retrieved 9 December 2008. Each participant is assigned a certain sound set for the night, although they do not find out what sounds they were being played until the following morning (after they have written down any dreams they had). Each sound set is a group of sound effects with a specific theme: early experiments showed that being played a wide variety of sound effects confused and exhausted the sleeper.Juliet Rix, \\"The big sleep experiment\\", The Times, July 7 2007, retrieved 9 December 2008. By playing themed sounds to sleepers when they are dreaming, it is hoped to alter the content of their dreams. For instance, sound effects evoking large echoey spaces might result in dreams set in large or open spaces.As described by participants in the short film by Kate Taunton The question of whether a participant's altered dream could be said to be art is still open to debate, and indeed Jerram encourages this discussion. The Dream Director is part art, part science: participants' dreams are analysed by sleep researchers at the University of the West of England. One possible outcome of this research is to see if techniques similar to the Dream Director can help people who suffer from sleep disorders such as recurring nightmares.

Preliminary remarks, first paragraph.: \\"Guidelines for Examination in the European Patent Office\\"  Structure and revisions  Since June 2012, the Guidelines include eight parts, relating respectively to the formalities examination (Part A), the search (Part B), the procedural aspects of substantive examination (Part C), the opposition and limitation/revocation procedures (Part D), general procedural matters (Part E), the European patent application (Part F), patentability (Part G), and the amendments and corrections (Part H). The Guidelines are revised annually.  Legal status  According to several decisions of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, the Guidelines are only general instructions intended to cover normal occurrences. An Examining Division can depart from them provided it acted in accordance with the European Patent Convention (EPC). \\"It [i]s normally desirable for examining divisions to act in accordance with the Guidelines, but (...) these [a]re not rules of law, so failure to follow a procedure set out in them [i]s not in itself a substantial procedural violation\\".: \\"Guidelines binding (in principle) on departments of first instance\\".Board of Appeal decision T 162/82 of 20 June 1987, Reasons 9 (OJ EPO 1987, 533).

Early Years and Grande Arm√©e service He was born in 1785 to General Pierre-Antoine and his wife, Lady Marguerite Desnoyers. He entered the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1801 and was commissioned as sous- lieutenant in 1803. He participated in the Italian Campaigns of the French Consulate and First French Empire from 1811. He was present at the Battle of Waterloo. He eventually obtained the rank of Chef de brigade or Colonel and Aide de Camp to General Curial. The Foreign Legion In 1830 the French invaded Algeria and disbanded the seven regiments of Swiss and Germans in the French Army. The Legion was formed on March 10, 1831. The Legion was initially formed of the following battalions. *1st, 2nd and 3rd - trained ex-soldiers from the Swiss and Hohenlohe regiments. *4th - Spanish (disbanded in Feb 1834 to release them for service at home in the First Carlist War) *5th - Sardinians and Italians *6th - Dutch and Belgians *7th/4th - Poles (not completed until February 1834, whereupon it replaced the Spanish 4th. In Spring of 1835, the French Government handed the use of the Legion to the Spanish Government in order to fight Don Carlos. Colonel Bernelle was given command and the local rank of General. He landed his troops on 17 August 1835 at Tarragona, where he had command of 123 officers and 4,000 men. He soon disbanded the nationally organized battalions and embraced the policy of amalgamation, with French as a common tongue. It 1836, Bernelle organized an artillery battery and three squadrons of Polish Lancers. On 24 May 1836, Bernelle and his men, \\" attacked Carlists threatening the garrison at Zubiri, northeast of Pamplona near . Fighting in heavy snow the Carlists were driven off with over 100 casualties, and 30 prisoners executed as a reprisal....\\" On 26 April, they defeated another Carlist force at the Battle of Terapegui, and again at 2nd Zubiri.

The game determined the 1998 football champion of the Big 12 Conference. The Texas A&M; Aggies, winners of the South Division of the Big 12, narrowly beat the Kansas State Wildcats, who won the North division, by a score of 36‚Äì33 in double overtime.Recap This would be the only time the two teams met in the Big 12 Championship Game. Texas A&M; would not win the South Division again until 2010 , when they shared it with Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. K-State went on to win the North in 2000 and 2003, when they also beat Oklahoma to capture their first conference title since 1934. The game remains infamous among K-State fans, as the Wildcats' loss prevented them from being invited to what would have been the program's first-ever National Championship game. The Wildcats were coached by Bill Snyder. They came into the game with an 11‚Äì0 record, including an 8‚Äì0 record in Big 12 play. The Aggies, coached by R. C. Slocum, went into the game with a 10‚Äì2 record including a 7‚Äì1 mark in conference play. Leading up to the game The Wildcats were undefeated heading into the game, only needing a win to secure a spot in their first ever National Championship game after UCLA had already lost the same day. Texas A&M; was just coming off of a loss in the previous week to their bitter rival, the Texas Longhorns, 26‚Äì24. The loss did not stop the Aggies from winning the South Division, and set them up with a match-up with the North Division Champion and #1 (Coaches Poll) team in the country, Kansas State. Game summary Ranked no. 10 nationally, Texas A&M; rebounded from a 27‚Äì12 fourth-quarter deficit to edge top-ranked Kansas State 36‚Äì33 in double overtime. Running back Sirr Parker scored 14 points on a pair of touchdown catches and a two-point conversion, rallying the Aggies to a 24-point surge in the final 9:20 of regulation and the extra periods. Parker's unlikely 32-yard reception for the winning TD on a 3rd-and-17 situation for Texas A&M; in the final overtime capped an evening of surprising developments for both teams. The final six-pointer also gave the Aggies their first football win in history over a team ranked first nationally at the time of the contest. Texas A&M; had trouble finding the end zone in the first half against the Wildcats‚Äô defense, as KSU built a 17‚Äì6 halftime advantage. A pair of Russell Bynum field goals helped offset a brilliant passing performance by KSU quarterback Michael Bishop, who was 8-of-8 passing for 159 yards and a pair of TDs in the opening 30 minutes. Tight end Justin Swift was a favorite target as he made three catches for 47 yards and one score. Linebacker Dat Nguyen led the Aggie defense with an interception to go along with a championship-most 17 total tackles. The pilfer led to a 57-yard Aggies‚Äô scoring drive, capped by a two-yard scoring plunge by A&M; freshman fullback Ja‚ÄôMar Toombs. Quarterback Branndon Stewart reeled off 245 passing yards on 11-of-20 aerial work and two touchdowns in the final quarter and two overtime periods, as the Aggies mounted the greatest comeback in the brief history of the Big 12 Championship. The two teams traded field goals in the first overtime session, with Bynum hitting from 18 yards and Gramatica connected from 22 yards. In the second overtime, KSU drove to the eight-yard line on four rushing plays of 17 yards. The Wildcats put one more field goal on the board for a 33‚Äì30 lead. Texas A&M; then converted as Parker caught the pass from Stewart and eluded one tackler before lunging over the pylon in the right corner for the winning score.

The goal is to capture these legacy business rules in a way that the business can validate, control and change them over time.  Overview  Business rule mining supports a Business rules approach, which is defined as a formal way of managing and automating an organization's business rules so that the business behaves and evolves as its leaders intend. It is also commonly conducted as part of an application modernization project evolving legacy software applications to service-oriented architecture (SOA) solutions, transitioning to packaged software, redeveloping new in-house applications, or to facilitate knowledge retention and communication between business and IT professionals in a maintenance environment.  Alternative approaches  Alternative approaches to rule mining are manual and automated. A manual approach involves the hand-writing of rules on the basis of subject matter expert interviews and the inspection of source code, job flows, data structures and observed behavior. Manually extracting rules is complicated by the difficulty of locating and understanding highly interdependent logic that has been interwoven into millions of lines of software code. An automated approach utilizes repository-based software to locate logical connections inherent within applications and extract them into a predetermined business rules format. With automation, an effective approach is to apply semantic structures to existing applications. By overlaying business contexts onto legacy applications, rules miners can focus effort on discovering rules from systems that are valuable to the business. Effort is redirected away from mining commoditized or irrelevant applications. Further, best practices best practices coupled with various tool-assisted techniques of capturing programs‚Äô semantics speeds the transformation of technical rules to true business rules. Adding business semantics to the analysis process allows users to abstract technical concepts and descriptors that are normal in an application to a business level that is consumable by a rules analyst. System integrators, software vendors, rules mining practitioners, and in-house development teams have developed technologies, proprietary methodologies and industry-specific templates for application modernization and business rule mining.

A. S. Abdel Haleem: The Qur'an, a new translation, note to 2:247. as he was the Malik (, King) of Israel, or Gideon, with the reasoning that the Quran references the same incident of the drinking from the river as that found in the Book of Judges (7:5-7),Judges vii. 5-7 and other factors associated with the latter.  Name  The name 'TƒÅl≈´t' has uncertain etymology. Unlike some other Quranic figures, the Arabic name is not similar to the Hebrew name (Sha'ul). According to Muslim exegetes, the name 'TƒÅl≈´t' means 'Tall' (from the Arabic \\"t≈´l\\") and refers to the extraordinary stature of Saul, which would be consistent with the Biblical account.Leaman, Oliver, The Quran, An Encyclopedia, 2006, p.638. In explanation of the name, exegetes such as Tha'labi hold that at this time, the future King of Israel was to be recognised by his height; Samuel set up a measure, but no one in Israel reached its height except TƒÅl≈´t (Saul).  Narrative in the Quran  Israelites demanded a King after the time of Musa (Moses), to lead them into war against their foes. Talut was chosen by the Prophet Samuel (not mentioned by name explicitly, but rather as \\"a Prophet\\" of the Israelites) announced that Allah chose Talut as their King. The Israelites questioned Samuel about this, lacking respect for Talut as he was not wealthy. Samuel then told them that Talut was more favored than they were. He was distinguished by the greatness of his knowledge and of his physique. A sign of his role as King was that God brought back the Ark of the Covenant for Israel. Talut tested his people at a river; whoever drank from it would not follow him in battle excepting one who took from it in \\"the hollow of the hand.\\" Many drank, and only the faithful ventured on. Talut led the Israelites to victory over the army of Goliath, who was killed by Dawud (David). Talut is not considered as a Nabi (, Prophet), but a Divinely appointed King. The Quranic account differs from the Biblical account (if Saul is assumed to be Talut) in that in the Bible, the Sacred Ark was returned to Israel before Saul's accession, and the test by drinking water is made in the Hebrew Bible not by Saul, but by Gideon.  Hadith  Talut is also mentioned in a(hadith) (, 'narration'): \\"Narrated Al-Bara: The companions of Muhammad, who took part in Badr, told me that their number was that of Talut's companions who crossed the river (of Jordan) with him, and they were over three-hundred-and-ten men. By Allah, none crossed the river with him, but a believer.\\"Bukhari: Book 5: Volume 59: Hadith 293: Military Expeditions led by the Prophet (Al-Maghaazi).

Early life He was born in 1878, in Elmalƒ± district of Antalya province, then in the Ottoman Empire, and now in Turkey. He is nicknamed after his birthplace: Elmalƒ±lƒ±. Elmalƒ±lƒ± means \\"from Elmalƒ±\\" or \\"born in Elmalƒ±\\" in Turkish. His father, Hoca Numan Efendi, who is also a scholar of Islam, was from the Yazƒ±r village of G√∂lhisar district of Burdur province, then in the Ottoman Empire, and now in Turkey. He is from Yazir sub- branch of Oghuz branch of Turkish nation. Hoca Numan Efendi, the father of Muhammed Hamdi, went to the Elmalƒ± district of Antalya for education when he was a child and settled there.

Political life When he was working in service of Sheikh ul-Islam, Committee of Union and Progress prepared a coup against the Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Yazir wrote the symbolic fatwa for the termination of the reign of Abdul Hamid II. He became a member of the senate of the Ottoman Parliament for Antalya. He strongly opposed Committee of Union and Progress which held a nationalist and militarist position. Moreover, he served as Foundations (Vakƒ±flar) Minister in the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed VI's Damat Ferid Pasha Cabinet. When the republic was founded, he was giving logic courses in Medrese-t-√ºl M√ºtehassisin (a postgraduate school). When Mustafa Kemal's government abolished the madrasas, he withdrew into solitude.

If passed it would have allowed a state income tax deduction equal to Federal exemptions deduction to substitute for state exemption credit on a persons state income tax filing. Background To determine taxable income for federal personal income tax, taxpayers generally may claim deduction ($3,100 maximum in 2004) for each exemption; exemption exists for taxpayer, spouse, each dependent. For state income tax purposes, taxpayers currently may not claim deductions based on federal return's exemptions but may subtract exemption credit ($151 in 2004, multiplied by number of federally allowed exemptions) from state income tax liability. Measure 41 was an Initiated state statute ballot measure which would have authorized a deduction on state income tax return for each dependent, taxpayer, and spouse claimed as exemption on federal return. The deduction was stipulated that it shall be no less than total deduction for all exemptions on federal return. An exemption credit may have been substituted for the deduction if lower tax resulted. It would have reduced revenue available for state expenditures and provided no replacement revenue. It was similar to Ballot Measure 88, rejected in the general election of 2000. =Description of the Measure= Ballot Measure 41 would have changed how state income taxes are calculated. Currently, Oregon taxpayers may take a personal exemption tax credit ($154 for 2005) for each exemption allowed under federal tax law. Typically a taxpayer may take a credit for him or herself, a spouse and each dependent. A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the amount of taxes owed. This tax credit is adjusted for the cost of living each year. The Measure would have given Oregon taxpayers the option of taking a tax deduction equal to the amount deducted on federal taxes. In contrast to a tax credit, a tax deduction is an amount that is subtracted from gross income to determine the amount of income that is subject to tax, or \\"taxable income.\\" Currently, federal law allows taxpayers to take a deduction ($3,200 in 2005) for each personal exemption allowed under federal law. Typical exemptions are for the taxpayer, the spouse and dependents. The federal personal income exemption is adjusted for the cost of living each year. This Measure would have permitted a taxpayer to claim either the new deduction created in this Measure or the existing personal exemption credit, if the existing credit would result in a lower tax for the taxpayer. Existing federal law sets forth many exemptions from federal income tax that are unrelated to the deduction for personal exemptions. Measure 41 provided that the new state deduction shall not be less than the total amount of the deduction allowed for all exemptions on the taxpayer federal tax return but does not contain a definition of all exemptions. The Measure stated that a repeal, delay in implementation or decrease in the amount of the deduction allowed would be subject to existing provisions of the Oregon Constitution requiring a supermajority vote for tax increases and prohibiting a bill regulating taxation or exemption from taking effect immediately following enactment through a declaration of an emergency. The fiscal effect of the measure would have been a reduction of general fund revenue for a variety of state funded programs. The effect would have been greater each successive year because the federal deduction is indexed for inflation. Given as an example at the time the measure was purposed, if passed it would reduce tax revenue for 2006, and it may affect then-current departmental and agency budgets. A change in revenue may also have affected the 2007 personal kicker. Election results Measure 41 was rejected, winning 43.5% of the vote (576,153 votes out of 1,325,557.) TAO, the main organized support for the measure received 94% of its funding from Illinois-based Americans for Limited Government, which sponsored similar measures in numerous states in 2006. Opposing groups also pooled their resources in pushing for the defeat of both Measures 41 and 48, spending $1.9 million.

The Title X program is designed to provide access to contraceptive services, supplies and information to all who want and need them. By law, priority is given to persons from low- income families.  Office of Research and Evaluation  The Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) oversees research and evaluation activities supported by the Title X Family Planning program and the Title XX Adolescent Family Life program. Each program has legislative authority to conduct research; program implementation and related research in the case of Title X and research on the causes and consequences of adolescent premarital sexual relations and pregnancy in the case of Title XX. The Title XX statute also requires an independent evaluation of all funded demonstration projects and these evaluations are overseen by ORE staff, as are other research and evaluation activities undertaken by OPA in collaboration with other federal agencies.

History The Kirkwoods were landlords in Tumna, and various members of the Kirkwood family had large landholdings in the townlands of Woodbrook, Dorrary, and Cloongownagh in 1858. James Kirkwood built Woodbrook School for the education of the children of his tenants; the family managed the school until 1911. Rev. John McDermott, P.P., Croghan became the manager of the school from 1911 until 1917. Originally 'planted' on the Mayo-Sligo border, near Killala, the Kirkwood family is first mentioned in records in or around the time of the 1691 rebellion. How they made their way to Roscommon is unclear, but it is possible that inter-marriage brought them to Roscommon (the Lloyd surname was incorporated into their surnames at one stage). The Anglo-Irish of the time kept to themselves and rarely inter-married with the native Irish. A family called Phibbs, who lived there, built Woodbrook House in 1780. (According to John and Mai Malone, Grehan Barlow, an historical architect from Birmingham who visited the house in the late 1990s, was of the opinion that the Phibbses had built a house at Woodbrook in 1671; this would imply an earlier structure either on or close to the site of the present house.) The original house was square and without wings, which were added in the 1880s. Little is known of the Phibbs family, other than it is likely that they were Planters. Woodbrook House became the home of the Kirkwoods in the nineteenth century, when they bought the lands from the Phibbs family. The Kirkwood family purchased the farm at Usna on the banks of the river Boyle and later obtained the farm at Woodbrook. Their home in Usna became known as Woodbrook House. The gate and railing at the road were erected after one of the Kirkwoods' horses, also named Woodbrook, won the Grand National in 1881, ridden by Mr Tommy Beasley and trained by Henry Linde. David Thomson's book Woodbrook gives an account of life at Woodbrook during the 1930s, when he lived there for several summers with the Kirkwood family as tutor to their daughter, Phoebe, with whom he had a platonic love affair. Miche√°l √ì S√∫illeabh√°in composed a piece for piano and orchestra called \\"Woodbrook\\", conceived as the soundtrack for a radio documentary called The Story of Woodbrook - David Thompson's Book, produced by Julian Vignoles, which was first transmitted on RT√â radio in 1986. Woodbrook House still survives as a residence but the estate has largely gone. In 1946, over fifty acres was sold to the local Carrick on Shannon Golf Club while the Land Commission subsequently divided the remainder.

A fianc√© of champion snow skier Jill Kinmont, whose tragic life story was made into the inspirational hit Hollywood motion picture The Other Side of the Mountain (1975), Dick died in a plane crash at the age of 27. Life Dick Buek was born in Soda Springs, Tahoe, California. As a youth, Buek was coached by ski champion Hannes Schroll and trained at the Sugar Bowl Ski Resort. Known as \\"The Madman of Donner Summit,\\" Buek exhibited a \\"go for broke\\" attitude that brought him success and pain in many downhill competitions. A serious racer by the age of 18, he was the National Downhill Champion in 1952 and a member of the 1952 Olympic Team. He won a second national downhill title in 1954. His record included two runner-up efforts, a third and a fourth at the national championships. In 1948, he did a straight schuss at the Inferno Race on Mount Lassen. In 1949, he won the Silver Dollar Derby and the Far West Ski Association's downhill title. In 1952, Buek won the United States National Downhill and competed in the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, finishing 12th. Buek seemed to be fearless and paid a heavy price for it. He suffered two broken backs, one from a motorcycle accident. He competed in the 1952 Winter Olympics Downhill in Oslo, Norway. Despite falling twice on the course and careening off course (into the trees and back out), he managed a 12th-place finish. In 1953, Buek crashed his motorcycle. The accident crushed his leg, pelvis, and shoulder. When the National Championship at Aspen occurred the following year, he could still only bend his right knee 60 degrees. Pins in his left shoulder hampered his stance. Though he won the race, he was passed over to compete at that season's FIS World Championships. In 1974, Buek was inducted into the National Ski Hall Of Fame. Death Buek died at the age of 27 while flying over Donner Lake. According to close friend Mary Ann Haswell, who survived an earlier crash into Donner lake with Buek, \\"Dick used to say he'd never make it to 28 years old.\\" Buek and Haswell were reportedly towing water skiers at the time of the first crash. At the time of the second crash, Haswell remembered, \\"Dick died a few days short of his birthday.\\" Buek wasn't at the stick of the airplane in which he was killed. It was a friend's plane and Buek was giving the friend a piloting lesson. The wings iced up and the plane dived straight into the icy waters. \\"Dick was a dynamic person and ahead of his time in pushing the limits of extremism,\\" recalled Haswell. \\"It was great being around him, if only for such a short period of time.\\" Buek is buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California. He was characterized by Oakley Hall in Hall's 1963 novel, The Downhill Racers. He was portrayed by Beau Bridges in the 1975 movie, The Other Side of the Mountain.Skiing, February 1976 ReferencesExternal links *Tahoe news article- Skiing article about Dick Buek *National Ski Hall of Fame - list of inducted members - Richard \\"Dick Buek\\" - 1974 *Photo and short bio - U.S. National Ski Hall Of Fame article on Dick Buek *Amazon Books-The downhill Racers on Amazon.co.uk *Articles with Hannes Scroll-Article on Hannes Schroll * * Category:1929 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Sportspeople from California Category:Alpine skiers at the 1952 Winter Olympics Category:Olympic alpine skiers of the United States Category:American male alpine skiers Category:People from Nevada County, California ","title":"Dick Buek"},{"id":"20732595","text":"Toms (stylized as TOMS) is a for-profit companybusinessoffashion.com Blake Mycoskie on 10 Years of Toms MAY 6, 2016 based in Los Angeles, California.TOMS Shoes, LLC Founded in 2006 by Blake Mycoskie, an entrepreneur from Arlington, Texas, the company designs and markets shoes -- as well as eyewear, coffee, apparel and handbags. The company was taken over by its creditors in December 2019, and founder Mycoskie ceased to be an owner.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tomsshoes-m-a-creditors- exclusive/exclusive-toms-shoes-creditors-to-take-over-the-company- idUSKBN1YV1PT Company history Blake Mycoskie visited Argentina in 2002 while competing in the second season of The Amazing Race with his sister. He returned on vacation in January 2006, and met a woman who was volunteering to deliver shoes to children. Mycoskie offered to help and has cited the shoe distribution experience, and the many shoeless children he encountered, as the birth of his idea for his eventual company. He decided to develop a type of alpargata (a simple canvas slip-on shoe that is popular in Argentina) for the North American market, with the goal of providing a new pair of free shoes to youth of Argentina and other developing nations for every pair sold. According to Mycoskie, Bill Gates encouraged him by saying that the lack of shoes was a major contributor to diseases in children. Upon returning to the U.S., Mycoskie sold the online driver education company that he was running for $500,000 to finance Toms Shoes. The company name is derived from the word \\"tomorrow,\\" and evolved from the original concept, \\"Shoes for Tomorrow Project.\\" Mycoskie initially commissioned Argentine shoe manufacturers to make 250 pairs of shoes. Sales officially began in May 2006. After an article ran in the Los Angeles Times, the company received order requests for nine times the available stock online, and 10,000 pairs were sold in the first year. The first batch of 10,000 free shoes were distributed in October 2006 to Argentine children. In 2007, the company launched its first annual \\"One Day Without Shoes\\" event, which encouraged participants to go shoeless for one day in order to raise awareness about the impact shoes can have on a child's life. The event has had corporate sponsors such as AOL, Flickr, and the Discovery Channel. In October 2007, Toms Shoes received the People's Design Award, as determined by an online popularity contest by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum By 2011, over 500 retailers carried the brand globally and in the same year, Toms launched its eyewear line. By 2012 over two million pairs of new shoes had been given to children in developing countries around the world. The Daniels Fund Ethics Initiative at the University of New Mexico has described the company as an example of social entrepreneurship. The company launched TOMS Roasting Co. in 2014, and with each purchase of TOMS Roasting Co. coffee, the company works with other organizations to provide 140 liters of safe water (equal to a one week supply) to a family in need that lives in a coffee-producing region. In 2015, TOMS Bag Collection was launched to help contribute to advancements in maternal health. Purchases of TOMS Bags help provide training for skilled birth attendants and distribute birth kits containing items that help women practice safe childbirth. In June 2014, the company announced that Mycoskie was looking to sell part of his stake in the company to help it grow faster and meet its long-term goals. On August 20, 2014 Bain Capital acquired 50% of Toms. Reuters reported that the transaction valued the company at $625 million; Mycoskie's personal wealth following the deal was reported at $300 million. Mycoskie retained 50% ownership of Toms, as well as his role as \\"Chief Shoe Giver\\". Mycoskie said he would use half of the proceeds from the sale to start a new fund to support socially minded entrepreneurship, and Bain would match his investment and continue the company's one-for-one policy. Business model\\"One for one\\"= Toms' business model is known as the \\"one for all concept\\" model, which is referring to the company's promise to deliver a pair of free shoes to a child in need for every sale of their retail product. The countries involved have included Argentina, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Haiti, Mexico, Rwanda, South Africa and the United States. The business has grown beyond producing shoes and has included eyewear and apparel in Toms product lines. The company uses word-of-mouth advocacy for much of its sales, centering its business focus on corporate social responsibility. Part of this model originally involved a non-profit arm called \\"Friends of Toms\\" that recruited volunteers to help in the shoe distributions in foreign countries. Toms trademarked the phrase \\"One for One\\" to describe its own business model. Toms has received criticism from the international development community who have stated that Toms' model is designed to make consumers feel good rather than addressing the underlying causes of poverty. Criticisms have also included whether or not the shoe donation is as effective as a monetary donation to other charities. Toms responded to this criticism by moving 40% of its supply chain for shoe donation to countries they actively give in. Toms presently manufactures shoes in Kenya, India, Ethiopia and Haiti. A 2014 paper in the Journal of Development Effectiveness studied the effect of Toms Shoes on local shoe markets, and did not find any statistically significant effect, although analysts and the paper's authors noted the study was limited in scope and time-scale. In 2019, Amy Smith, TOMS' Chief Giving Officer, announced in their 2019 Impact Report that the company would no longer be following the \\"One for One\\" business model that TOMS pioneered. This was her statement: \\"We made the decision to decouple our impact from the One for One model we pioneered, and to expand our giving portfolio to include impact grants. This way, we can support organizations working to address some of today‚Äôs most pressing issues.\\" =Focuses for Corporate Responsibility= Author Daniel H. Pink described the company's business model as \\"expressly built for purpose maximization\\", whereby Toms is selling both shoes and its ideal. Toms' consumer market are purchasing shoes and also making a purchase that transforms them into benefactors for the company. Another phrase used to try to describe the business model has been \\"caring capitalism\\". Part of how Toms has developed this description is by incorporating the giving into its business model before it made a profit, making it as integral to the business model as its revenue generating aspects. Business tycoon and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson wrote of the company's business model in his book Screw Business as Usual, \\"They look for communities that will benefit most from Toms based on their economic, health and education needs while taking into account local business so as not to create a correlating negative effect.\\" He also commented on Toms' expansion into eyewear in order to help the nearly 300 million people who are visually impaired in developing nations. The company's shoe distribution partners have focused on distributing shoes in areas where health and social benefits of the shoes would be the highest. For example, in Ethiopia the shoes are intended to help prevent a soil-borne disease that attacks the lymphatic system and which largely affected women and children. Toms sunglasses are sold with the One for One model, however it does not necessarily provide glasses only to those in developing countries. The One for One model includes putting money toward medical treatment, eye surgeries and prescription glasses. Toms works with the Seva Foundation among other partners to accomplish this. The first countries that Toms implemented its program were Nepal, Cambodia and Tibet. The original three designs, according to Leigh Grogan, were \\"The stripe on the temples represents the buyer; the stripe on the tips represents the person whose sight is being helped, and the middle stripe represents Toms, which brings the two together.\\" Shoe distribution Shoes have been given to children in 70 countries worldwide, including the United States, Argentina, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Swaziland, Guatemala, Haiti and South Africa. Toms are sold at more than 500 stores nationwide and internationally, including Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, and Whole Foods Market, which include shoes made from recycled materials. A story by LA Weekly priced the manufacturing cost of a pair of Toms Shoes at $3.50-$5.00 in U.S. dollars, and noted that the children's shoes given out by the company were among the cheapest to make, which is not necessarily apparent to consumers. According to garment-industry author Kelsey Timmerman, many people he spoke to in Ethiopia were critical of the company, saying that they felt it exploited the idea of Ethiopian poverty as a marketing tool. An Argentina- based shoemaker agreed, saying that the imagery used by the company was manipulative. Employees of Toms travel to different countries on \\"Giving Trips\\" to deliver shoes to children in person. In 2006, Toms distributed 10,000 pairs of shoes in Argentina. In November 2007, the company distributed 50,000 pairs of shoes to children in South Africa. As of April 2009, Toms had distributed 140,000 pairs of shoes to children in Argentina, Ethiopia, South Africa as well as children in the United States. As of 2012, Toms has given away over one million pairs of shoes in 40 countries. =Campus clubs= Students attending colleges across the United States have created TOMS campus clubs. As of March 20, 2014, 281 campus clubs existed in the United States with another dozen located in Canada. By comparison, another nonprofit organization known as Lions Club International was established in 1917 and is known for working to ending the cause of blindness, reports 400 Lions‚Äô campus clubs in 42 countries. PhilanthropyPartnerships= In 2009 Toms partnered with the Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project to create limited edition shoes, and used profits to benefit education and medical support in remote areas of Africa suffering from AIDS outbreaks. Toms has also produced shoes with a handlebar mustache symbol in place of the traditional Toms symbol in support of the Movember Foundation. Toms is a supporter of the charity charity: water, with which it has partnered with for several years, including its WaterForward project, which aims to bring clean water to underdeveloped countries. An additional partner charity is FEED, a charity where a consumer will purchase a pair of shoes and the company will donate twelve meals to impoverished schools in addition to a pair of shoes for impoverished children. The major mission of Toms is that a business, rather than a charity, would help their impact last longer. In his speech at the Second Annual Clinton Global Initiative Mycoskie states that his initial motivation was a disease called podoconiosis‚Äîa debilitating and disfiguring disease which causes one's feet to swell along with many other health implications. Also known as \\"Mossy Foot\\", podoconiosis is a form of elephantiasis that affects the lymphatic system of the lower legs. The disease is a soil-transmitted disease caused by walking in silica-rich soil.Sharaby, Orli. \\"Toms Shoes' Blake Mycoskie Talks to PSFK\\". Syfy. March 9, 2009. Toms currently works with factories nearby where they perform some of their shoe drops. =Influence= The Tom's 'One for One' model has inspired many different companies to adopt similar concepts. Warby Parker, launched in 2010, donates a pair of glasses to someone in need for every pair of glasses it sells. The social business Ruby Cup uses a 'Buy One Give One' model for their menstrual cup venture, benefiting women in Kenya. A Bristol chiropractic center influenced by Mycoskie's Start Something That Mattersamazon.com Start Something That Matters book started donating ¬£1 to Cherish Uganda for every appointment attended. citizenAID North America launched in 2018, donates life-saving training to US teachers and educators. =Focus on the Family= In July 2011, Toms founder Blake Mycoskie participated in an event sponsored by the group Focus on the Family. After being criticized for supporting a socially conservative non-profit, Mycoskie posted an apology on his website stating that he and his handlers had not heard of Focus on the Family before participating in the event and decided it was a mistake. He also stated that he and the company support equal human and civil rights.

She was the first child of William and Sue Wills. She made her stage debut at the age of 1 in a production of Rumplestiltskin performed by the Baltimore Actor's Theatre alongside her father and went on to star on Broadway and in Regional Theatres across the country. She has a son born in 2008 named Vincent. Early years The family moved to Ocean City, Maryland where her parents established a live children's theater. Parker Playhouse opened in 1978 and over time became a favorite of the city's many summertime visitors. Jennifer performed in almost every production the theater company produced. Her parents now run Presidents and Their First Ladies Dramatically Speaking, a production company that performs nationwide and provides great insight to the personal lives of our many presidents and their wives. Wills received a BA from Salisbury State University where she starred on the main stage as Maria in West Side Story, Lily in The Secret Garden and Elizabeth Sandry in The Grapes of Wrath. She then earned her MM at the prestigious Indiana University School of Music where she starred on the main stage as Laurey in Oklahoma!, Papagena in The Magic Flute, Josephine in H.M.S. Pinafore and Gossip I in The Ghosts of Versailles. After graduating she taught voice at the college level for two years before heading to New York City. Broadway Wills made her Broadway debut in 2004 as the understudy for Belle in Disney's Beauty and the Beast. Eight months later she had to leave abruptly as she became an immediate replacement for Jennifer Westfeldt as Eileen co-starring opposite Brooke Shields in Wonderful Town. Both Wills and Shields received amazing reviews with Clive Barnes of the New York Post stating that \\"Both Shields and Wills are smashing. These two are not replacements, they are renewals\\". and Ben Brantley singled Wills out for her own little feature. They also re-released the original new cast recording with their voices replacing the original stars. Wonderful Town only ran four more months so Wills was out of work and decided against other people's better judgment to accept a replacement ensemble position in Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Woman in White. However, this productions was very short lived and Wills performed in it for just one week. But that job led directly to Wills getting to audition for her dream job, Christine Daae in The Phantom of the Opera. She was immediately asked to become the Alternate (performing the role twice weekly) and just two months later was asked to take the Principal position on the National Tour for 10 weeks as they traveled through Canada where she received rave reviews.

The nominal duties of the out-ranger were to preserve any deer which escaped the bounds of Windsor Forest. (Under forest law, the Sovereign owned all the deer within a royal forest, even though they might not be crown property.) In practice, the office was a sinecure. The first known appointment to the position was that of Denzil Onslow in 1686 or 1694. He was deprived of his office in 1711 when the Junto Whigs were crushed. In 1715, the office was granted to Denzil's great-nephew Hon. Thomas Onslow. While it provided an emolument for him, the principal purpose of the appointment was to force Thomas to vacate his seat as Member of Parliament for Guildford, under the terms of the Place Act 1707. By removing him from the House of Commons, he could now stand in the by-election for Surrey, which had been vacated when his father Richard was made a Teller of the Exchequer. (Richard was about to be made a peer, hence his failure to stand in the by-election himself.) Two years later, when Thomas succeeded to his father's barony, Denzil Onslow again received the office for the same reason, vacating his seat at Guildford to successfully contest Surrey. This presaged the use of other offices of profit under the Crown as a means of resignation from the British House of Commons, which became formalised in the offices of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds and Steward of Northstead. Denzil held the office until his death in 1721. Brigadier Richard Munden was appointed in 1722, but died in September 1725. He left his financial affairs considerably entangled, and the underkeepers who performed the duties of the office had to petition for the arrears of their salaries.Calendar of Treasury Papers He was succeeded by John King, 2nd Baron King, who had a grant of the office for life in 1726; his brother Peter King, 3rd Baron King succeeded him in 1740, but the office was again granted to an Onslow in 1754. George Onslow was the second cousin once removed of Thomas, who had held the office until 1717. He held the office until the beginning of 1763, when Fox purged the government of Newcastle's supporters. Onslow MSS, pp. 520‚Äì521 It went to Lord Charles Spencer, who lost it on the fall of the Bute Ministry and was replaced by Benjamin Bathurst. Bathurst, in turn, was displaced by the Rockingham administration. The office now passed to Col. George Onslow, first cousin to the previous George, who received a grant of it for life for supporting the ministry. Upon his death, it was given to Viscount Cranley, the son of the first George Onslow, who held it until its abolition in the early 19th century. Salary and perquisites The office was originally unsalaried, but after its revival in 1715, it paid ¬£600 per year, of which about ¬£200 had to be dispersed to pay under-keepers. Another source gives the salary as ¬£500 per year, increased to ¬£900 around 1776. It had grown to ¬£1,200 per year when the office was abolished.Hansard, 30 March 1830 A small lodge named Fan Grove on the edge of Windsor Forest was formerly the property of the out-ranger. It was used as a residence by Admiral Sir Richard Onslow, 1st Baronet, younger brother of Col. George Onslow.

She is portrayed by Amanda Tapping. In the series, Magnus is a biologist from Victorian era England, who currently runs the global Sanctuary Network, an organization tasked with finding a series of creatures called \\"abnormals\\", and later bring them to a Sanctuary base for refuge to protect them from the human population. The character is over two and a half centuries old, having been given her advanced longevity by injecting herself with vampire blood, as well as reliving the 20th century from time travel. After traveling back in time, Magnus had to avoid people so she isolated herself. In the season 4 finale \\"Sanctuary For None: Part 2\\" It was revealed that Magnus spent the 113 years creating a new Sanctuary. Tapping was offered a part in the original web series by series creator Damian Kindler and director Martin Wood. It became the actress' first regular role since playing Samantha Carter on Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis for eleven years. She initially had difficulty playing Magnus as her personality greatly differed from Carter. She also dyed her hair darker and spoke with an English accent throughout the run, as she herself was born in England. In addition, Tapping serves as the series executive producer and on some occasions, director. Magnus and Tapping's portrayal of the character received generally mixed reactions from critics, with the negative comments pointing toward's Tapping's accent. However, Tapping was nominated for four awards, one Gemini Award and three Leo Awards, for her role as Helen Magnus, winning a Leo Award for \\"Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series\\" in 2009 for the episode \\"Requiem\\". Character arcBackground= Helen Magnus was born on August 27, 1850 to Gregory Magnus (Jim Byrnes) and Patricia Heathering. Her father was regarded as a controversial medical researcher of his time, and exposed his daughter to his profession when she was a child. Years later, she helped form a secret group known as \\"the Five\\", along with John Druitt (Christopher Heyerdahl), Nikola Tesla (Jonathon Young), James Watson (Peter Wingfield) and Nigel Griffin (Vincent Gale) at Oxford University. Each member voluntarily injected themselves with pure vampire blood, a species that had become extinct centuries before. This granted each member unique abilities. Magnus' ability was longevity, allowing her to live several times longer than any normal human. At this point she entered a relationship with Druitt, whose ability is personal teleportation. However, he became insane and murdered several prostitutes, thereby becoming Jack the Ripper. They did conceive a child, Magnus later took the embryo and froze it. By the turn of the 20th century, her research with the abnormal population went into full swing, and she founded the Sanctuary Network. To get the funding she needed, the Prime Minister reunited the Five to stop and kill Adam Worth (Ian Tracey), who was turned down as a sixth member and blamed the Five for the death of his daughter, from releasing a toxin in London. In the season two episode \\"Next Tuesday\\", Magnus states she was a passenger on the RMS Titanic in 1912. In July 1944, she worked with the French Resistance in Normandy to prevent the Nazis from controlling a fire elemental before D-Day. She then charged the head Sanctuary in Old City, a fictional city in the Pacific Northwest, during which she decided to use the embryo to bear her daughter, Ashley (Emilie Ullerup). On one of her expeditions, she saved a young Will Zimmerman from a dangerous abnormal, but failed to capture it before it killed his mother. =Season one= In the first season of the show, Magnus appoints an adult Will (Robin Dunne), a forensic psychiatrist who worked for the Old City Police Department, to become her new prot√©g√©, which he eventually accepts. Druitt returns to the Sanctuary to ask Magnus to cure him from an unknown affliction; Magnus tricks him into injecting poison, though Druitt escapes. Later, in \\"The Five\\", it would be revealed Druitt survived, and Tesla was able to suppress his insanity. In \\"Fata Morgana\\", she becomes aware of an underground organization known as the Cabal, who plot to control all abnormals for their own gain, and in several episodes throughout the first season, will become her and her organization's primary focus. In \\"Requiem\\", Magnus becomes exposed to an aggressive parasite in the Bermuda Triangle when going with Will to see a group of mermaids who massacred each other because of the same parasite. To stop Magnus from killing Will and herself, Will locks her in a cabin in the submarine, and drains all the oxygen, killing her. She is later revived after Will captures the escaping parasite. In the two-part season finale \\"Revelations\\", the Cabal launch a bioweapon called \\"Lazarus\\", which causes any exposed abnormal to attack humans. To combat this, Magnus regroups the Five to Bhalasaam, a lost city, to recover the source blood (vampire blood). However, by the end Magnus is distressed to learn that the Cabal have turned Ashley against her and the team and steals the blood sample. =Season two= The second season begins six weeks after the end of the first, where Magnus works hard to defeat the Cabal and save Ashley, whom the Cabal transformed to a vampire-hybrid superabnormal, one of six tasked to destroy the Sanctuary Network. When the superabnormals arrive at the Old City Sanctuary, Magnus is able to get through to Ashley, who recognises her in time to save her from another superabnormal, and then teleports. Because an electromagnetic field is active, it would mean whoever teleports inside would be vaporized. Despite this, Magnus believes Ashley's life energy may be in the electromagnetic field's buffer. When it does not, she is forced to accept that Ashley has died. Because of her death, and other loved ones because of her longevity, she tried to find a way to age at a normal rate again. She finds an elixir used by the Mayans in Honduras, but it has the side effect of turning humans into zombie-like creatures. After being shown the potential consequences of the elixir's release by an incorporeal guardian, she decides to leave it behind. Later on in the season, her leadership of the Sanctuary Network would be called into question by the other heads of house. In \\"Veritas\\", she sets up an elaborate scheme to apprehend a telepath named Emma (Erica Cerra), whom she suspects of working against the Network. In the scheme, Magnus forges a mental illness and fakes the murder of her butler, Bigfoot (Heyerdahl), and makes Emma believe she kept alive Big Bertha, the most dangerous abnormal on Earth, which Magnus was thought to have killed. However, it is revealed in the season finale \\"Kali\\", Magnus did indeed keep her alive in secrecy, but sedated, as she believes that killing Bertha would jeopardize the planet. When Big Bertha is being controlled by Edward Forsythe, Magnus attempts to sedate Big Bertha again, but by then, Terrence Wexford (Paul McGillion) overrides her authority and assumes control of the network. His attempt to kill Bertha only succeeds in angering her, and she launches a tsunami. =Season three= The third season begins with Magnus forcing Wexford to step down as head of the Sanctuary Network, thereby putting herself back in command, while the rest of the team deal with the tsunami. Though they are not happy that Big Bertha is still alive, the other Sanctuary house heads decide to keep Magnus in charge, while also firing Wexford for breaking several protocols. She learns from Will that when he talked to Kali, the avatar manifestation of Big Bertha, into stopping the tsunami, he saw her father, who left her clues leading to a map leading to Hollow Earth, thought to be the home of every abnormal species on the planet. In \\"Breach\\" Magnus learns Adam Worth is still alive, and he also intends to find Hollow Earth, having been there before and resurrected. After finding an entrance to Hollow Earth in Tibet, she and the team venture to the underground city of Praxis, where leader Ranna (Polly Walker) executes her and her team for trespassing. However, they are later resurrected as she wants their help in saving the city, which is facing destruction because a hyperspecies abnormal is not controlling the city's geothermal energy. After saving it, Magnus and her team and Ranna part in good terms. It is also revealed Worth also came to the city to steal a power source with unlimited capabilities. Though it was assumed Druitt killed him before he could leave with it, it is later revealed in the season finale that Druitt kept him alive and that he is using the power source to create a time machine and cure his daughter's leukemia, which could cause untold consequences on the planet. His first failed attempt causes the destruction of Praxis, and a time dilation bubble in Carentan, France. Magnus fails to stop him from succeeding, but does follow him through a time portal to London in 1898. =Season four= Magnus pursues Worth throughout London to stop him from curing his daughter Imogene, who is meant to die in the timeline. During the pursuit she tries to avoid her past self, but fails to stop encountering Watson, who quickly discovers she is from his future, but he promises to keep quiet for the sake of preserving the timeline. When Worth chases Magnus later he accidentally kills Imogene, restoring the timeline. After killing Worth, Magnus ends up in hiding for the next 113 years before she can resurface to help Will dealing with a mass of Abnormals invading the surface. In the season finale, it is revealed that Helen had been secretly working with several important figures of the 20th Century, including Albert Einstein and Buckminster Fuller amongst others, and had built a new underground Sanctuary. Characterization The Syfy website describes Magnus as \\"beautiful and enigmatic\\" who has \\"devoted her life to the practical research of cutting edge medicine and science\\". Her work is to explore the world of abnormals. While the rest of the world dismiss them as monstrous figments of their imaginations and elements of childhood nightmares, Magnus realizes that they are the world's triumphs and mistakes. Magnus hence becomes their protector, but in some cases, their captor. She is also described as \\"bold and straightforward, brave and no-nonsense, yet she remains proudly true to her formal Victorian English sensibilities\\". Portraying actress Amanda Tapping described Magnus as a \\"crazy character\\" who is \\"very eccentric and very sexy and very unapologetic\\". Magnus \\"adores her daughter Ashley, respecting her independence and self-reliance ‚Äì but that doesn't preclude some occasional mother-daughter friction\\". Tapping has said that there is a \\"huge amount of respect\\" between the two characters, adding \\"Ashley knows that when her mother says she needs to do something then she says it for a reason. And Magnus has a huge amount of respect for Ashley because Ashley can do things that she can't.\\" Magnus made a hard choice of having Ashley even though she does not have her mother's longevity, and Magnus would outlive her daughter. In the first season Magnus recruits Will as her prot√©g√©. When asked what Magnus thinks of Will, Tapping stated \\"I think Helen finds him fascinating. He's so idealistic, she sees in him all the qualities that she admires, but all the qualities that she knows will probably get beaten out of him over the course of time. His idealism and purity of thought and the way he analyses things ... she absolutely respects that, but I think she also realises that there's going to come a time when he's going to become a bit jaded ... There are a couple of episodes where there's been this bizarre sexual tension between the two of them ... but generally there's just a huge healthy respect.\\" During a Blastr interview in 2011, Tapping further explains Magnus' relationship with Will; \\"I love how this relationship has developed. [...] \\"It's been a really organic transformation of Will's character and Magnus. To actually bring somebody on board who, initially, it's all about teaching him the ropes. And then as the seasons have gone on he's come into his own. He's come into his own as a scientist. He's come into his own in terms of his relationship with the people in the Sanctuary.\\" Dunne meanwhile stated \\"there's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters. And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of.\\" Conceptual history Amanda Tapping plays Magnus. It was her first regular role since appearing as Samantha Carter in the Stargate franchise for over a decade. Series creator Damian Kindler conceived the idea of Sanctuary in 2001, many of his ideas were included in the final product, one of them being the English scientist Helen Magnus. A few years later, Kindler asked Martin Wood if there was a potential for a series. When Wood believed it would be, they both decided to approach Amanda Tapping to participate in the project, and she accepted. Kindler believed that casting Tapping was a \\"nice fit\\" to the character because the actress was born in England. Tapping, who played the regular character Samantha Carter in Stargate SG-1 and sister show Stargate Atlantis, did not know the future of her role in the show when she was approached to appear on Sanctuary in 2006. When the webseries started shooting in January 2007, it did not conflict with her commitments on Stargate. After the fourth season of Atlantis, Tapping was offered to return to the fifth season and she accepted. When Sanctuary was picked up to a television series, Tapping decided to turn down the Atlantis contract, having been encouraged by her husband to move on after playing Carter for eleven years. She went through a \\"weird disconnect\\" playing Magnus since \\"Sam Carter was so much a part of me\\". However, she was able to embrace playing a new character \\"pretty quickly\\". Nevertheless, Tapping found it a challenge to play a different character, as Carter and Magnus have differing personalities and points of view; \\"after playing a character like Sam Carter for so long where her physicality is so comfortable ‚Äì Sam is so comfortable in her own skin and Helen is this very sexual, more mysterious being. She has a much darker edge to her and it was sort of finding that because Carter always looks on the bright side and Helen has been around so long, and has seen so much of the evil in human society if you will.\\" Whilst filming the webisodes, Tapping wore a dark-haired wig, but when the television series was being shot, she dyed her hair to match the hair colour of the wig. Tapping spoke with an English accent throughout the run of the series. Although many of her relatives are from the United Kingdom and speak with British accents Tapping found the accent a challenge, as her character came from the Victorian era, which is a \\"very specific way of speaking. She clings to that eccentricity a bit, to that Britishness.\\" The actress listened to several different voices, as she had to factor in the fact that Magnus lived all around the world. Sanctuary was mostly filmed on virtual green screen sets. Initially Tapping went through what she called \\"chroma key green headaches\\" because she had to stare at nothing but bright green walls for the first few days. When she got used to it, she likened filming on green screen to working in theatre. In the second season her daughter, Ashley was killed off. The producers, as well as the American and Canadian networks to give the character, including Magnus, a deep and most dramatic impact. They also wanted Magnus to feel more angry and vulnerable throughout the season, especially in the first three episodes. After playing Magnus in the series' third season, Tapping admitted that she still does not get Magnus because \\"there's so many things about the decisions that she makes that I still can't wrap my head around, and to me that's fascinating as an actor, to try to get inside somebody so complex and so kind of confusing.\\" In the episode \\"Normandy\\", Tapping wore a red-haired wig for Magnus during her time in the Second World War, as an homage to her late grandmother. For the fourth season, Tapping requested that Magnus would be given a new love interest. The request was granted in the form of a female virologist appearing early in the season (thus establishing Magnus's bisexuality). In addition to being an actor, Tapping was also an executive producer on the series. However, she did not get paid extra as that salary would go towards financing the show, which was not backed up by a studio. She also served as a director on certain days if other directors were unavailable, or called in sick. In the second season, she was allowed to direct \\"Veritas\\", the seventh episode. ReceptionCritical reaction= According to Mark Wilson of About.com, Amanda Tapping was enthusiastic about creating a radically different character after eleven years playing Samantha Carter in Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis, and expended tremendous effort to separate Helen from Carter as successfully as possible. Tapping was able to successfully portray a woman who's experienced a century and a half of isolation, strangeness, and relentless compassion. Rick Bentley from McClatchy Newspapers commented Tapping's role as Dr. Magnus was a way for the actor to make a name of herself outside the Stargate universe as Carter. Magnus is also described as a \\"non-glib, female Jack Harkness;\\" Jack Harkness being the main character from the British science fiction show Torchwood. Hilary Rothing of UGO said that \\"Dr. Helen Magnus is intelligent, alluring and has one of those tasty British accents ‚Äì Victorian era to be exact. That's because she's a 157 years old. But seriously, she doesn't look a day over 35.\\" She also added that Tapping is \\"right at home\\" taking the lead for the show. Alex Walker of Den of Geek believed Magnus was \\"typical for an English character in an American TV show, with a liking for tea and a cut-glass elocution betraying no hint of a regional accent\\". Helen Magnus has been listed number ten in TV Squad's \\"Ten Most mysterious characters on television\\". Magnus's English accent was not well received by some critics. She was listed ninth in io9's \\"Worst Fake Accents From The Yanks (And Canucks) Of Science Fiction\\", with Meredith Woerner stating \\"I really want to like this new Sci Fi Channel show, especially since the monsters look amazing ‚Äì but I'm worried Tapping's dreadful accent will get in the way. It sounds completely forced in all the clips I've seen so far, but I'll guess I'll have to wait until October 3 to make my full assessment.\\" Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune wondered why Tapping decided to speak with an \\"iffy accent,\\" but added she would be of interest by fans of Tapping's previous works, notably Stargate. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called Tapping's English accent \\"unremarkable\\", whilst calling the show an \\"unremarkable series.\\" =Accolades= Over the course of the series, Tapping's portrayal of Magnus resulted in several award nominations. Tapping was nominated for a 2009 Gemini Award for \\"Best Performance by an Actress in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role,\\" for her role in \\"Requiem\\", but lost out to Being Erica's Erin Karpluk In the same year, Tapping won the similar \\"Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series\\" Leo Award for the same episode. She was nominated for the same category again in 2010 for \\"Pavor Nocturnus\\", and in 2011 for \\"Breach\\", but lost out to Erin Karpluk and Blackstone's Carmen Moore, respectively.

It was founded in 2004 by Just Jay, who initiated Urban Umpires as a collection of entrepreneurs, DJs, producers, MCs, graffiti artists, videographers, instrumental artists, graphic designers, and the like, several years before its incorporation. Members Urban Umpires is most widely known for its private hip hop organization, whose members have included: Umpires: * Amad Jamal aka Tom Bradley * Marc Stretch of Foreign Legion * Cold Showda (MC) * B-Smoove (MC) * MoJo Swagger (MC) * Brisk-1 (producer) * Concise Kilgore Senior Umpires: * DJ Coop D'ville * Various Blends * Ras Cue Aka Black Burgandy/EBF (VP of Operations) * Friz B (Bola) * CrushDelight (VP) * Just Jay (CEO and founder) The Junior Umpires membership list is currently private. The only publicly known members are: * Beatmaker B (from Russia; producer/DJ) * Flip (from Austria; producer/DJ and promoter) * Intro Beats (from Iceland) Structure Urban Umpires Incorporated was established in 2006, but the Urban Umpires Organization itself dates back several years earlier, as Urban Umpires' structure is twofold. There are members of the organization (Umpires) currently acting as CEO and VP, as well as some who sit on the board of directors of the corporation. However, the Umpires themselves are not all involved in the corporate aspect of Urban Umpires. The subsect ‚Äì or original defining body ‚Äì of Urban Umpires is the Umpires Organization. The Umpires Organization consists of select Umpires who represent Urban Umpires' interests in Urban Umpires Inc. Unofficially, Urban Umpires also includes a select group of Urban Umpires affiliates, including Hieroglyphics, DAE Recordings, Marcus Aurelius, Chocolate Sound, The Solution, Santero, Tha Fruitbat, Cali Agents (Rasco and Planet Asia), Adisa Banjoko, Dilated Peoples, and Freddie Foxxx. Radio Urban Umpires established itself in radio with small independent online radio broadcaster btr in 2006. Urban Umpires' hip hop mix show The Third Rails debut made it the seventh show airing on the station's seven-day rotation at the time. By early 2007 Urban Umpires was the largest single content provider to the broadcaster, with a total of eight original multi-genre shows, as well as artist interviews and video content. In mid-2007, Urban Umpires provided 10% of the station's total music programming content, and Umpire Just Jay was officially titled the station's Urban Platform Programming Director. Urban Platform: * The Third Rail - hip hop * Bhangra Beats * Dancehall Riddims * Latin Hip Hop * World Hip Hop - hip hop in world tongue * Glitch IDM - intelligent dance music * Electric Avenue - deep house * Downtime Sessions - downtempo/trip-hop At its peak the eight-show platform's audience reached over 40 million listeners weekly. The original show, The Third Rail, aired 120 episodes, and the proceeding shows aired nearly 100 apiece. Afrika Bambatta, RZA from Wu Tang, Money B of Digital Underground, the Notorious Vic Black from the Gang Starr Foundation (who after over 20 years in the game made his DJing debut on The Third Rail) and countless others guest hosted, were interviewed for, and supported the platform of shows. In early 2008 Just Jay collaborated with MC Opio (Souls of Mischief/Hieroglyphics) on the artist's Vultures Wisdom Vol.1 DVD via video content fabrication and production. The album was hailed as the year's hip hop standard for indie progressive urban videography and lyrical content. Urban Umpires and MySpace both released authorized sneak peeks of the album. Myspace then released the cut version. Urban Umpires released the uncut vocal and unreleased tracks along with a personal artist interview with Opio. The Umpires, the artists played on the platform of shows, and affiliates invested in the platform parted with the station in late 2008. The music library, the rights to play content of the library, and the entirety of the urban platform's related audio, visual and written content, remained property of Urban Umpires Inc. Urban Umpires has moved the platform to MadMixRadio.com, which was scheduled to launch in the summer of 2010.

He was a member of the Fon ethnic group, which dominated the Beninese (then known as Dahomeyan) army from 1965 to 1967. Sinzogan was General Christophe Soglo's aide and commander of the First Battalion in Cotonou.. Sinzogan's rise to power occurred during a period of intense regionalism in Dahomey. They were spurred by the historical resentment shared by members of the former kingdoms of Abomey, Porto Novo, and disorganised tribes from the north.. Its result was the creation of three de facto tribal zones: the north, southeast, and southwest.. This regionalism permeated into the armed forces, compounded by divisions of officers into cliques based on education. Hach√®me was a member of what Decalo called the Abomey clique, which also included prominent offices Philippe Aho, Jean-Baptiste Hach√®me, and Benoit Adandejan.. He was the original head of the Comit√© Militare de Vigilance when it was established on April 6, 1967, which was set up to administer President Christophe Soglo's regime. Maurice Kouand√©t√© was established as his vice president. As corruption began to seep in, the Comite lost its value.. After Kouandete usurped the presidency on December 17, Sinzogan was placed under house arrest at the Ghezo military camp. until December 19. Political career That day, Sinzogan was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, his first political post, which he held until July 1968. In September, he was named the leader of the national police. He held that office until August 1970, during which time he was given the post of president of the gendarmerie.. On December 10, 1969, Kouand√©t√© staged another coup, against then-president Emile Derlin Zinsou. A Military Directorate was formed on December 13 to administer Dahomey in the aftermath.. Sinzogan was a member, the head of the ministries of Justice, Foreign Affairs, and Education. When Hubert Maga was proclaimed head of a Presidential Council on May 7, 1970, Sinzogan lost that post. Sinzogan was alternate judge of the military trial convened in 1972 to address an attempted coup that Kouand√©t√© tried to perpetrate. He handed the death penalty to Kouand√©t√© and two of his companions. In October, when Mathieu K√©r√©kou seized power in a coup, Sinzogan was removed from the military and appointed commissioner of the National Society of the Development of the Forest (S.N.A.F.O.R.).

It opened in 1851 as part of the Buckinghamshire Railway's branch line to Verney Junction which provided connections to Bletchley and Oxford and closed in 1963.  History  Situated in an isolated location over a mile from the village from which it took its nameSimpson, B., p. 73. \\\\- and further still from two others it was supposed to serve: Greatworth and Middleton CheneyKingscott, G., p. 61. \\\\- Farthinghoe station first appeared in timetables in October 1851. Its precise opening date is unknown, but was almost certainly within one year of the line's inauguration. The Buckinghamshire Railway provided basic facilities which consisted of a single wooden platform and solitary goods siding on the up side of the line. The main station building, a part-timber and part-brick structure in an \\"H\\" shape, was of unusual construction, with the main ticket office and booking hall housed in a one-storey weather-boarded wing with a steeply-pitched gable roof which projected over the platform as a sort of makeshift canopy. The stationmaster occupied an adjacent two-storey building which was linked with the ticket office by a two-storey tile-hung central block which contained a waiting room. The style of construction can be explained by the Buckingham Railway's need to save on costs in the face of an economic crisis.Jenkins, S.C., p. 83. The station boasted limited goods facilities, with a cattle dock and weigh bridge provided for the mainly agricultural traffic. Until the mid-1930s, goods trains would shunt the siding daily with regular loads of pink roadstone granite as well as coal for W. Palmer & Son, local coal merchants. The Second World War saw Farthinghoe handle ammunition destined for the RAF's Hinton-in-the-Hedges Airfield.Simpson, B., p. 78. Station location in 1992 Farthinghoe station was situated on the busiest section of the line, the 5¬Ω mile stretch from Merton Street to Cockley Brake, where there was a junction with the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway (SMJ).Davies, R. and Grant, M.D., p. 103. Opened on 1 June 1872, the section provided connections to Towcester and Blisworth.Davies, R. and Grant, M.D., p. 104. The LNWR and SMJ jointly served Farthinghoe and Merton Street until they were absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway on 1 January 1923 upon the railway grouping. The station lost its stationmaster from 1930 and came under the control of Banbury, only 3¬Ω miles away.Kingscott, G., p. 62. Former SMJ passenger services were withdrawn as from 2 July 1951. Farthinghoe was itself to close to passengers the following year.Davies, R. and Grant, M.D., p. 221. Routes A 1911 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Farthinghoe  Present day  The station buildings have been demolished and replaced by a council dump and pulveriser plant.

Black Jr. (known by the nickname ‚ÄúTank‚Äù) (born March 11, 1957) is a former sports agent. Black was an assistant coach for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks before starting his Columbia, South Carolina-based sports agency, Professional Management Incorporated (PMI) in 1988. His first client was former Gamecocks wide receiver Sterling Sharpe, a first-round draft pick by the Green Bay Packers in 1988. Black‚Äôs career peaked in April 1999 when he set a new record for a single agent by signing five of that year‚Äôs 31 first- round NFL draft picks, plus three second round draft picks. Within a year he had been accused of improperly funneling cash to college players, and became implicated in a money laundering case, a Ponzi investment scheme, and allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission that he was involved in a stock swindle.http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1019341/index.htm In a plea agreement, he admitted to money laundering and obstruction of justice charges, and lost a criminal trial on charges of stock fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2004, while serving nearly seven years in prison, he represented himself in his appeal of the SEC-related case and won, effectively clearing himself of allegations that he cheated clients. He was released from prison in December 2007. Early life William H. Black, Jr. was born on March 11, 1957 in Johnson City, Tennessee, to William H. Black, Sr. and Thelma Brown. His father nicknamed him ‚ÄúTank‚Äù because of his son‚Äôs unusual birth weight (11 pounds) and broad head. College Coaching Career Black joined the coaching staff at University of Tennessee- Chattanooga in 1980, and in 1983, became a wide receiver coach at University of South Carolina, and the school‚Äôs top recruiter. In 1987, Black left the program after he was passed over for a promised promotion to offensive coordinator in favor of Atlanta Falcons assistant coach Al Groh, who was white. South Carolina‚Äôs then-athletic director, Bob Marcum, denied that race played a role. Professional Management Incorporated In 1990, Black founded Professional Management Incorporated with Bill Bradshaw, a Columbia businessman and one of Black‚Äôs former wide receivers at South Carolina, and a marquee client, Sterling Sharpe, whom Black had known from his days coaching at South Carolina. Black and Bradshaw had an amicable split in 1995 when Black purchased Bradshaw's ownership in PMI. With his college recruiting skills, his own experience as a player, his shared cultural background, and personal charisma, Black eventually represented over 50 black NFL players, as well as National Basketball Association star Vince Carter. He also owned a travel agency, an outgrowth of his sports agency. Downfall Black hired James Franklin, Jr., a Columbia, South Carolina lawyer, in September 1997 to help manage the growing business. Franklin introduced Black to representatives of Cash 4 Titles, which made small loans at high interest rates to individuals who put their cars up as collateral. Cash 4 Titles was looking for investors and promising a 20% return, and offered commissions to Black‚Äôs firm for investments by his clients. Black subsequently invested his own money along with some of his clients, friends, and family. Unknown to Black at the time, Cash 4 Titles was a ponzi scheme and Franklin was secretly being paid finder's fees by Cash 4 Titles. Black was emerging as one of America‚Äôs top African- American businessmen, and began to expand his business, including purchase of a hotel property in Detroit, where gambling had recently been legalized. The seller of the hotel, John Bryant, and an associate, Dean Parker, became friendly with Black and began to invest in Cash 4 Titles, showing up in South Carolina with bags of cash. Bryant and Parker were principals in a Detroit- based cocaine operation. Special Agent Kevin Boudreau testified in federal court that Bryant and Parker were laundering millions of dollars in drug cash through Tank Black, and Black assisted Dean Parker flee the country in 1998 to avoid prosecution in Detroit. By 1999, Black was looking for new business opportunities and began preliminary talks to sell his agency to Percy Miller, better known as rap star Master P. Black's company (PMI) was estimated to be worth as much as $100 million at the time. In 1999, a rival agent complained to the NFL Players Association that Black was illegally providing money to college players before they were eligible for the draft. In May, the University of Florida police department formally charged Black http://www.sportslawnews.com/archive/Articles%202000/Blackindicted.htm with violating Florida laws against early recruiting of college players and executed a search warrant on Black‚Äôs Columbia, South Carolina office. In a highly questionable move, the university police turned over all of Black‚Äôs records to the NFL Players Association. Black went to court and won possession of his records back but a month later, the FBI executed a search warrant on PMI‚Äôs offices, again removing all his records and computers. With controversy swirling around him, Black‚Äôs clients began asking for their money back from Cash 4 Titles. The company returned some of the money but was itself the subject of an SEC investigation. By Feb. 2000, Cash 4 Titles was exposed as a fraud, and Black was charged with ‚Äúfraudulently causing two dozen athletes‚Äù to lose an estimated $13.5 million. By July 2000, Black had pleaded guilty to providing loans to college players in Florida, was facing SEC fraud charges, was being sued by several of his players for the money they lost in Cash 4 Titles, and had been indicted in Detroit on money laundering and drug charges related to his involvement in Bryant‚Äôs investments in Cash 4 Titles. Black ended up pleading guilty to fraud and money laundering.http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5830191_ITM Consequences Black was sentenced to 82 months in prison on the money laundering charges in Michigan.http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/06/14/black010614.html In Florida, he fought the SEC charges but was found guilty of fraud, and obstruction of justice.http://classaction.findlaw.com/cases/securities/sec/sec1/files/2000/lr16455.html Four years later, while in jail, Black represented himself in an appeal of a civil suit the SEC had filed against him and won. The court found there was no evidence that Black knew anything about the Cash 4 Titles scheme. In June 2001, the television program ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Most Wanted‚Äù aired a segment on Dean Parker,http://www.amw.com/Fugitives/brief.cfm?id=24937 a fugitive in the Detroit cocaine case. Black agreed to be interviewed for the program in prison, talking about his relationship with Parker and how he had allowed Parker to use Black's leased jet to escape to Jamaica. Parker committed suicide http://panachereport.com/channels/hip%20hop%20gallery/DeanParker.htm a few months later as police were about to arrest him in East St. Louis, Illinois. In October 2004, while still in prison, Black sued Vince Carter for $14 million in unpaid agent fees.http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/89377 Black won and to avoid a protracted appeal, settled for $4.7 million with the Carter family.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_21_106/ai_n7580053 Black was released from federal prison in December 2007, and from a halfway house in May 2008.

Barrington University, was incorporated, licensed and headquartered in Mobile, Alabama offering $4,450 degrees granting considerable credit for life experiences. Barrington operated as a subsidiary of Boca Raton-based Virtual Academics. =Controversy= The company's literature claimed that its chairman had a doctorate and a master's degree; an investigation showed that he had neither. Barrington also claimed accreditation by the International Association of Universities and Schools Inc. (IAUS). However, a 2003 investigation by the South Florida Business Journal revealed this was a for-profit corporation set up in Florida (not Switzerland or Washington, D.C., as claimed) by Virtual Academics' chairman, Robert Bettinger, and the owner of another for-profit college in 1998. According to the New York Post, they did this to avoid further problems due to their schools' lack of accreditation. The IAUS' charter was subsequently dissolved by the State of Florida for failure to pay annual registration fees. The South Florida Business Journal also reported that Barrington was paying professors and schools in China commissions to sell Barrington degrees to Chinese students; this revelation caused a major drop in Chinese enrollments and a resulting decline in revenues. In 2000, school began having problems with the State of Alabama. The state threatened to revoke its operating license. State investigators determined that Barrington had been operating out of the offices of a secretarial and answering service. A General Accounting Office investigation found that Barrington was offering degrees for a fee based solely on life experience and requiring no classroom experience. By 2008, the State of Alabama was conducting a crackdown on such schools operating in Alabama, requiring that all be accredited or actively seeking accreditation by October. =Establishment and operation as University of Atlanta= The building in which the University of Atlanta has its office; the sign reads \\"Iverson Business School\\" In 2008, while still operating in Mobile, Barrington changed its name to the University of Atlanta. The university also received accreditation from the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC).Report From the Accrediting Commission, pp. 26-30 in DETC News, Fall 2008, Distance Education and Training Council, accessed 12-12-2009. In early 2012, the University of Atlanta's accreditor, the Distance Education and Training Council DETC, announced that the school had stopped enrolling new students and that University of Atlanta resigned its accreditation on June 30, 2013. Authorizations and affiliations The University of Atlanta was authorized by the Georgia Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission It was a member of the European Association for Distance Learning the American Council on Education, and The American Academy of Project Management In 2008, it became affiliated with the United States Department of Defense's Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) although in it was listed in the DANTES list of participating institutions. The university was accredited with premier status by the Accreditation Service for International Colleges (ASIC) in the United Kingdom. Academics According to the State of Georgia's Nonpublic Post Secondary Education Commission, the University of Atlanta was authorized to grant Bachelor of Science (BSc), Master of Science (MSc) and Doctor of Science degrees in different fields of study.

It is mainly used for cricket and is one of three stadiums in the country, the other two being Sharjah Cricket Stadium and Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi. It has a capacity of 25,000 spectators, but is expandable to 30,000 spectators. It is a part of the Dubai Sports City in Dubai.

Stadium History The first ODI cricket match played here was between Australia and Pakistan on April 22, 2009; it was won by Pakistan. The stadium's first player to take a five-wicket haul was Shahid Afridi with 6/38, which was his career best figures at the time. The top score at this stadium is 302* is held by Azhar Ali against West Indies in 2016. The stadium hosted its first Test match when Pakistan played South Africa on 12‚Äì16 November 2010; the match resulted in a draw. The November 2010 ODI series between Pakistan and South Africa ended with a 3-2 series win for South Africa. South Africa sealed the series with a 57 run win against Pakistan. Pakistan held a series against New Zealand and one Twenty20 International against England. This followed with a five-match ODI series of which three matches were played at this stadium. The second match in the stadium was also the last match by Australian international all- rounder Andrew Symonds. In 2012 Pakistan met England in the first test at Dubai. Pakistan won it easily, by 10 wickets. Saeed Ajmal was the Man-of-the- Match, after his outstanding 10 wicket haul.

Document Review is a valuable main staple of the type of work performed by attorneys for their clients, though it is increasingly common for the work to be performed by specialized document review attorneys. Some types of cases that typically require large numbers of documents to be reviewed are litigation, mergers and acquisitions, and government and internal investigations (including internal audits). Regarding litigation, documents reviewed by attorneys are obtained through the discovery process, which is generally governed by rules of procedure for the presiding court. In cases in United States Federal Courts the rules related to discovery are Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (F.R.C.P.) 16, 26, 33, 34, 37, and 45 which were amended in 2006 to include electronically stored information. Though attorneys do still review hard copy documents today, most documents are reviewed electronically either as native files that were originally created electronically or as electronic copies of documents that were originally created in a hard copy format. During the doc review process, each document may be tagged according to certain categories, including whether it is relevant to an issue in the case, whether it is responsive to a discovery request (and therefore may need to be produced as part of the discovery process), whether it is confidential, or whether it is attorney client or otherwise privileged. When large amounts of documents need to be reviewed electronically, often a system is set up that includes review software. This system is known as a platform. The terms electronic discovery and technology assisted review have arisen to reflect the dominance of electronically stored information and the increasing use of machine learning and other technologies to help curb the growing cost of document review. At times, even with the use of electronic document review platforms the volume of documents that need to be reviewed by an attorney for a case can be expansive and many attorneys including even highly staffed international law firms will need to obtain assistance beyond their standard resources. In these instances other attorneys are often brought into the case to assist specifically with the review of the documents. Traditionally, the additional attorneys needed to assist were hired on directly by attorneys and firms, or they may have worked as independent contractors. In recent years, many legal staffing companies have begun to act as intermediary employers between the law firms and the attorneys hired to assist with the document review. This trend has led to controversy in the legal profession as more and more of the work traditionally performed by U.S. attorneys is being outsourced to countries like India as a result of the legal staffing companies attempting to drive the rates down to remain competitive. Traditional markets in the United States where many attorneys and firms typically hire additional attorneys to assist with document review are Washington, D.C., New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, and Chicago. In Canada many attorneys assist with document review in Toronto. In Europe the biggest market for document review is typically London.

He is the first Iraq War veteran to pursue refugee status in Europe and only the second U.S. soldier to ever apply for refugee status in Germany. Military Service in Iraq After attending college Shepherd enlisted in the United States military in early 2004. He claims he was enticed by promises of financial security and international adventure. Shepherd became an Apache helicopter airframe mechanic, hoping to someday qualify up to the role of helicopter pilot. His first unit was deployed to Iraq when he completed his training. Shepherd spent six months on a forward operating base near Tikrit, working 12-hour days to keep the heavily armed Apaches (and their signature Hellfire missiles) in the air. Asylum seeker in Germany After returning to his unit, stationed in Katterbach, Bavaria, he seriously deliberated the effects of U.S. military action on the civilian population in Iraq. \\"Finally I knew that if I went back, I would be responsible for the deaths and misery of others.\\" He felt he could not apply for conscientious objection because U.S. military regulations state a conscientious objector must have an objection to all wars in all form. Shepherd's objection was not in opposition to all wars under any circumstances. On April 11, 2007 Shepherd went Absent Without Leave (AWOL) from his Katterbach base in Germany. Shepherd's application for asylum cited a European Union regulation providing refugee status to a soldier who is in danger of being prosecuted if military service \\"would include crimes or acts\\" which violate international law. The application refers to the Nuremberg Trials (also see Nuremberg Principles), stating \\"It is established that a person cannot defend his or her actions by explaining that they had simply been following orders.\\" Shepherd stated on the grounds of his decision: \\"We should not be forced to fight an illegal war, nor should we be persecuted for refusing to do so\\" and \\"During the past five years we have waged a preemptive, internationally condemned war that was shown to be founded on a series of lies. After learning the truth about the nature of my military's endeavors, I refuse to continue to be a part of this.\\" Shepherd's asylum application in effect asked Germany to define the US-led war in Iraq as a violation of international law, which has led to opposition from some German politicians to the application, over worry that it could harm US‚ÄìGerman relations. Shepherd received support from various organisations in Germany: Military Counseling Network, Connection e.V. and Iraq Veterans Against the War. He attended the anti-war event Winter Soldier: Europe that took place in Germany on March 14, 2009. Videos of the event were posted to YouTube by the IVAW. Shepherd is currently being assisted by the German refugee detention center, asylum support groups and various sympathizers. Shepherd's Legal Case On April 4, 2011, the German government announced that it had denied Shepherd's asylum application. On April 7, 2011, Shepherd launched an appeal against this decision. On January 23, 2013, the administrative court in Munich was supposed to hear the case. However, the hearing was cancelled and the court sent a request for a preliminary ruling to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg for clarification on applicable European Union laws. Shepherd's appeal to the German court was stayed, pending the outcome of the European Court ruling. The European Court of Justice scheduled a public hearing regarding Shepherd's asylum application for June 25, 2014. On November 12, 2014, Advocate General Eleanor V.E. Sharpston of the European Court of Justice advised that Shepherd had the right to claim asylum in the European Union despite the fact that he was a non-combat helicopter mechanic. She further advised that it was for the German court to decide whether the punishment that Mr. Shepherd would face if convicted of desertion in the U.S. would count as an act of persecution. She also advised that the German court would need to determine whether there was a reasonable likelihood of Shepherd being involved in war crimes, if he were deployed to a conflict zone, without needing to establish that fact beyond reasonable doubt. On February 25, 2015, the European Court of Justice ruled in line with Advocate General Sharpston's opinion. The court held that, while it is possible Shepherd could seek asylum in Germany, he would have to prove that he would have been involved in war crimes and that deserting was his only option to avoid committing such crimes. The ECJ left that finding to German courts to decide, as well as whether the prosecution Shepherd could face under the Uniform Code of Military Justice of the U.S. actually amounted to persecution. Shepherd's case returned to the German court for its decision. Public Discussion and Honours On February 7, 2009 Andr√© Shepherd was awarded the Peace Prize \\"Peace through Conviction\\" of the Munich American Peace Committee. The award was presented in the context of protest activities against the Munich Conference for Security Policy. The national newspaper The Tageszeitung awarded Shepherd its Tax-Panther-Preis Prize in 2010.

History Following the 1980 Azores earthquake many of the buildings/homes were abandoned First known in the 17th century, this small agglomeration of houses was named for one of its first settlers: Diogo Nunes Belo. Since its early settlement, the inhabitants of the faj√£ were occupied in subsistence agriculture and raising of cattle. At the time this included cultivation of vineyards, lupin bean and sweet potato, while seaweed/algae was used as fertilizer. By 1891, there were 131 residents inhabiting the faj√£. Following the 1980 earthquake, there was a landslide and rockfalls resulting damage to the cliffs. On this occasion 22 people resided in settlement, but moved to nearby settlements following the events: 30 years after the events of 1980 the area was abandoned. Geography Situated between the Faj√£ dos Cubres and Faj√£ dos Tijolos, Belo is a small debris field built from landslides forming a coastal plain. Access to this faj√£ is conditioned by weather, and vehicles are not permitted on the dirt trails, resulting in mostly pedonal or quad traffic. The lands are relatively fertile and support grazing of cattle and cultivation of sweet potatoes and supporting small vineyards. Some fishing continues to occur offshore.

They have been likened to Celtic fusion artists such as Shooglenifty and Martyn Bennet. Bongshang have recorded three studio albums to date (Crude, The Hurricane Jungle and Vy-lo-fone), made numerous TV appearances, licensed tracks for TV, featured on several compilation albums and toured the UK and Europe extensively, playing with artists such as Rory Gallagher, Joan Baez, Capercaillie, Alan Stivell, Aly Bain and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. History and personnel Members have included banjo player JJ Jamieson (ex member of Hexology (with Harry Horse) and The Critter Hill Varmints) who has been part of every incarnation of the band, fiddler Leonard Scollay (winner of the Shetland Young Fiddler of the Year competition, BBC Scotland Young Traditional Musician of the Year finalist and ex member of Shetland band Rock, Salt & Nails) and fiddler Peter Gear (also winner of the Shetland Young Fiddler of the Year competition). Bongshang were formed in 1991 after JJ Jamieson visited Shetland whilst on tour with The Critter Hill Varmints, decided to stay and recruited musicians from the local bands he heard; fiddler Leonard Scollay, bassist Bryan Peterson (then only 15), drummer Christopher 'Kipper' Anderson and guitarist Mark Gibbons. Gibbons later emigrated to Australia and was replaced by Neil Preshaw. This line-up released the debut album Crude in 1993, recorded in the back room of the Garrison Theatre in Lerwick. Bongshang toured frequently around this time regularly headlining concerts and festivals such as Festival Interceltique de Lorient, Nantes Celtica and Celtic Connections. Scollay left to concentrate on touring with Rock, Salt & Nails and was replaced by fiddler Peter Gear who brought a new sound to the band with his use of the Skyinbow electric violin, and Gear and Preshaw began to make extensive use of effects processors during gigs. Bongshang's live appearances became less frequent during this period, preferring the studio environment in Shetland where they were able to experiment with multilayering instruments, samples and loops. Bongshang recorded The Hurricane Jungle with this line-up, released in 1996. Preshaw and Peterson moved to Glasgow soon after and were replaced by guitarist Gordon Tulloch and bassist Andrew Gray. Scollay returned to the live line-up and for a time the band featured two fiddles. Gear left before the band recorded the Vy-lo-fone album in 1999, a fusion of electronic beats and banjo driven tunes. Bongshang continued to make rare live appearances through the noughties with Peterson and Gray sharing bass duties and Gear and/or Scollay on fiddle. The current line up is reported to feature Shoormal drummer Archer Kemp and guitarist Jonny Polson with Jamieson, Peterson and Gear. In 2010 film production company B4 Films published a webpage which seemed to indicate the band were working on a feature film soundtrack In 2011, members of the band collaborated with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra on a piece of music performed on the island of Foula, the UK's most remote inhabited islands, and broadcast live on the Internet. In 2013 Bongshang released a series of videos accompanied by new compositions (see Discography) including a screening to an audience in Mareel during the 'Back From Beyond' project concert.

Geography Road branching from NH22 to Nako Nako is the largest village at an elevation of ( is also mentioned) in the Hangrang Valley with the backdrop of Reo Purgyal which has an elevation of and is the highest mountain in Himachal Pradesh. The village is now on a more stable location near the Nako Lake (formed by the slopes of the mountains of Reo Purgyal), compared to the opposite bank across the Nako river where it was located earlier and then shifted because of tectonic upliftment of the site. As of 2002, the village had a population of 416. Access to the village is from a branch road of from the National Highway 22. It is away from Kalpa. Nako Monastery in the upper part of the village and the Nako Lake are important landmarks in the village. Apples and Sun dried apricots are the agricultural produce from the village. LandmarksNako monastery= Nako Monastery A view of Nako lake in August 2008 Nako monastery (Tibetan language:Lob-dpon- zhabrjes ) dated to the 11th century (1025 AD), oriented towards Tibet, similar in style to the Tabo Monastery consists of four large halls of which the oldest and largest is known as Dukhong. It is also known as 'Lotsava Jhakang' meaning \\"complex of the translator\\" named so in honour of Rinchen Zangpo who translated Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit to the Tibetan language. The iconographic art work in the monastery is related to Vajrayana Buddhism. The dukhong's walls have decorations of a complete mandala with \\"gates, fire-circle and secondary non-Buddhist deities in attendance\\". To the east of this dukhong there is another hall of smaller size which has a sculpture of Yellow Tara (known as Grolgster) made in stucco, with its roof and walls painted with mandalas. In the third hall there is an elegant image of Vairochana. Within the complex there is a shrine dedicated to Purgyal, a local deity with attribution as the \\"spirit of the mountain\\". Sculptures of five Dhyani Buddhas made out of clay are defied in the main hall where there are also many images. In the earthquake of 1975 the buildings were affected. Many bright artworks in the monastery were vandalized. During this earthquake event roofs of the monastery and other buildings in the village were damaged. Further, during the severe winter season of 1998 the monastery was in near collapse stage. Following these disastrous events, in May 1998, the University of Vienna launched a research Project in association with the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), the Buddhist Association of Nako, and local residents of Nako to carry out restoration works. In July 2002, the Nako Preservation Project (NPP) came to be established for conservation of the monastery and other buildings in Nako. =Nako lake= Nako Lake with the monastery and the village in the background Nako Lake, a small lake at elevation in the Kinnaur district, is away from the district headquarter town of Reckong Peo.

During the evening twilight hours a very large number of birds flock the lake. There is a rock here which is believed to have the foot print of Padmasambhava., recording his visit to the area. A shrine has been built around this foot print and there is also stucco statue of Padmasambhava above it in addition to murals. The periphery of the lake has plantations of willow and poplar trees.

It is the only baleen whale endemic to the Arctic and subarctic waters. Bowheads are named after their characteristic massive triangular skull, which is used to break through Arctic ice. Other common names of the species are the Greenland right whale or Arctic whale. American whalemen called them the steeple-top, polar whale,Scammon, Charles M. (1874) The Marine Mammals of the North-Western Coast of North America, New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, . or Russia or Russian whale. Bowheads have the largest mouth of any animal representing almost one-third of the length of the body, the longest baleen plates with a maximum length of 4 m (13.1 ft) and may be the longest- lived mammals, with the ability to reach an age of more than 200 years. The bowhead was an early whaling target. The population was severely reduced before a 1966 moratorium was passed to protect the species. Of the five stocks of bowhead populations, three are listed as \\"endangered\\", one as \\"vulnerable\\", and one as \\"lower risk, conservation dependent\\" according to the IUCN Red List. The global population is assessed as of least concern.  Taxonomy  Carl Linnaeus named this whale in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae (1758). Seemingly identical to its relatives in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Oceans, they were all thought to be a single species, collectively known as the \\"right whale\\", and given the binomial name Balaena mysticetus. Today, the bowhead whale occupies a monotypic genus, separate from the right whales, as proposed by the work of John Edward Gray in 1821. \\"The taxonomy is not in doubt.... Concerning common names, the species was once commonly known in the North Atlantic and adjacent Arctic as the Greenland Right Whale. However, the common name Bowhead Whale is now generally used for the species.\\" For the next 180 years, the family Balaenidae was the subject of great taxonometric debate. Authorities have repeatedly recategorized the three populations of right whale plus the bowhead whale, as one, two, three or four species, either in a single genus or in two separate genera. Eventually, it was recognized that bowheads and right whales were different, but there was still no strong consensus as to whether they shared a single genus or two. As recently as 1998, Dale Rice, in his comprehensive and otherwise authoritative classification, Marine Mammals of the World: Systematics and Distribution, listed just two species: B. glacialis (the right whales) and B. mysticetus (the bowheads). Studies in the 2000s finally provided clear evidence that the three living right whale species comprise a phylogenetic lineage, distinct from the bowhead, and that the bowhead and the right whales are rightly classified into two separate genera. The right whales were thus confirmed to be in a separate genus, Eubalaena. The relationship is shown in the cladogram below: The earlier fossil record shows no related cetacean after Morenocetus, found in a South American deposit dating back 23 million years. An unknown species of right whale, the so-called \\"Swedenborg whale\\", which was proposed by Emanuel Swedenborg in the 18th century, was once thought to be a North Atlantic right whale by scientific consensus. Based on later DNA analysis, those fossil bones claimed to be from Swedenborg whales were confirmed to be from bowhead whales.

Unlike most cetaceans, the bowhead does not have a dorsal fin - an adaptation for spending much time under sea-surface ice.Haldiman, J. T. and R. J. Tarpley (1993). \\"Anatomy & Physiology\\". In Burns, J. J.; Montague, J. J.; and Cowles, C. J. The Bowhead Whale. Special Publication No. 2: The Society for Marine Mammalogy. Bowhead whales are comparable in size to the three species of right whales. According to whaling captain William Scoresby Jr., the longest bowhead he measured was long, while the longest measurement he had ever heard of was of a whale caught at Godhavn, Greenland, in early 1813. He also spoke of one, caught near Spitsbergen around 1800, that was allegedly nearly long. In 1850, an American vessel claimed to have caught a individual in the Western Arctic. Whether these lengths were actually measured is questionable. The longest reliably measured were a male of and a female of , both landed in Alaska.Koski, William R., Rolph A. Davis, Gary W. Miller, and David E. Withrow (1993). \\"Reproduction\\". In Burns, J. J.; Montague, J. J.; and Cowles, C. J. The Bowhead Whale. Special Publication No. 2: The Society for Marine Mammalogy. p. 245. On average, female bowheads are larger than males. Analysis of hundreds of DNA samples from living whales and from baleen used in vessels, toys, and housing material has shown that Arctic bowhead whales have lost a significant portion of their genetic diversity in the past 500 years. Bowheads originally crossed ice-covered inlets and straits to exchange genes between Atlantic and Pacific populations. This conclusion was derived from analyzing maternal lineage using mitochondrial DNA. Whaling and climatic cooling during the Little Ice Age, from the 16th century to the 19th, is supposed to have reduced the whales' summer habitats, which explains the loss of genetic diversity. A 2013 discovery has clarified the function of the bowhead's large palatal retial organ. The bulbous ridge of highly vascularized tissue, the corpus cavernosum maxillaris, extends along the centre of the hard plate, forming two large lobes at the rostral palate. The tissue is histologically similar to that of the corpus cavernosum of the mammalian penis. This organ is thought to provide a mechanism of cooling for the whale (which is normally protected from the cold Arctic waters by or more of fat). During physical exertion, the whale must cool itself to prevent hyperthermia (and ultimately brain damage). This organ becomes engorged with blood, causing the whale to open its mouth to allow cold seawater to flow over the organ, thus cooling the blood.  Behaviour  Resting on water surface in Foxe Basin Breaching off Alaskan coast = Swimming = Bowhead whales are not social animals, typically travelling alone or in small pods of up to six. They are able to dive and remain submerged under water for up to an hour. The time spent under water in a single dive is usually limited to 9‚Äì18 minutes. Bowheads are not thought to be deep divers, but they can reach a depth down to . These whales are slow swimmers, normally travelling around []. When fleeing from danger, they can travel at a speed of []. During periods of feeding, the average swim speed is increased to []. = Feeding = The head of the bowhead whale comprises a third of its body length, creating an enormous feeding apparatus. Bowhead whales are filter feeders, feeding by swimming forward with mouth wide open. The whale has hundreds of overlapping baleen plates consisting of keratin hanging from each side of the upper jaw. The mouth has a large, upturning lip on the lower jaw that helps to reinforce and hold the baleen plates within the mouth. This also prevents buckling or breakage of the plates from the pressure of the water passing through them as the whale advances. To feed, water is filtered through the fine hairs of keratin of the baleen plates, trapping the prey inside near the tongue where it is then swallowed.Bowhead Whale . American Cetacean Society. Retrieved on 16 November 2015. The diet consists of mostly zooplankton, which includes copepods, amphipods, and many other crustaceans. About of food are consumed each day. While foraging, bowheads are solitary or occur in groups of two to 10 or more. = Vocalization = Bowhead whales are highly vocal and use low frequency (<1000 Hz) sounds to communicate while travelling, feeding, and socialising. Intense calls for communication and navigation are produced especially during migration season. During breeding season, bowheads make long, complex, variable songs for mating calls. From 2010 through to 2014, near Greenland, 184 distinct songs were recorded from a population of around 300 animals. = Reproduction = Sexual activity occurs between pairs and in boisterous groups of several males and one or two females. Breeding season is observed from March through August; conception is believed to occur primarily in March when song activity is at its highest. Reproduction can begin when a whale is 10 to 15 years old. The gestation period is 13‚Äì14 months with females producing a calf once every three to four years. Lactation typically lasts about a year. To survive in the cold water immediately after birth, calves are born with a thick layer of blubber. Within 30 minutes of birth, bowhead calves are able to swim on their own. A newborn calf is typically long, weighs roughly , and grows to within the first year.  Health  Lifespan = Bowhead whales are considered to be the longest- living mammals, living for over 200 years. In May 2007, a specimen caught off the Alaskan coast was discovered with the head of an explosive harpoon of a model manufactured between 1879 and 1885, so the whale was probably harpooned sometime between those years, and its age at the time of death was estimated at between 115 and 130 years. Spurred by this discovery, scientists measured the ages of other bowhead whales; one specimen was estimated to be 211 years old. Other bowhead whales were estimated to be between 135 and 172 years old. This discovery showed the longevity of the bowhead whale is much greater than originally thought. According to researchers at CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, the genome sequence revealed bowhead whales' maximum lifespan to be 268 years. = Genetic benefits = A greater number of cells present in an organism was once believed to result in greater chances of mutations that cause age-related diseases and cancer. Although the bowhead whale has thousands of times more cells than other mammals, it has a much higher resistance to cancer and aging. In 2015, scientists from the US and UK were able to successfully map the whale's genome. Through comparative analysis, two alleles that could be responsible for the whale's longevity were identified. These two specific gene mutations linked to the bowhead whale's ability to live longer are the ERCC1 gene and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene. ERCC1 is linked to DNA repair and increased cancer resistance. PCNA is also important in DNA repair. These mutations enable bowhead whales to better repair DNA damage, allowing for greater resistance to cancer. The whale's genome may also reveal physiological adaptations such as having low metabolic rates compared to other mammals. Changes in the gene UCP1, a gene involved in thermoregulation, can explain differences in the metabolic rates in cells.  Ecology  Drawing of a bowhead whale in 1884 = Range and habitat = The bowhead whale is the only baleen whale to spend its entire life in the Arctic and subarctic waters.Moore, S. E., and R. R. Reeves (1993). \\"Distribution and Movement\\". In Burns, J. J.; Montague, J. J.; and Cowles, C. J. The Bowhead Whale. Special Publication No. 2: The Society for Marine Mammalogy. The Alaskan population spends the winter months in the southwestern Bering Sea. The group migrates northward in the spring, following openings in the ice, into the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. The whale's range varies depending on climate changes and on the forming/melting of ice. Historical range could have been broader and more southern than that of currently regarded as bowheads had been abundant among Labrador and Newfoundland (Strait of Belle Isle), and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence at least until 16th and 17th centuries, although whether or not this was due to colder climate of those periods is unclear. Distributions of Balaena spp. during the Pleistocene were far more southerly as fossils have been excavated from Italy and North Carolina, thus could have overlapped between those of Eubalaena based on those locations. = Population = Generally, five stocks of bowhead whales are recognized: 1) The Western Arctic stock in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas, 2) The Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin stock, 3) The Baffin Bay and Davis Strait stock, 4) The Sea of Okhotsk stock, and 5) The Svalbard-Barents Sea stock. However, recent evidence suggests that the Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin stock and the Baffin Bay and Davis Strait stock should be considered one stock based on genetics and movements of tagged whales.  Western Arctic  The Western Arctic bowhead population, also known as the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort population, has recovered since the commercial harvest of this stock ceased in the early 1900s. A 2011 study estimated that the Western Arctic population was 16,892 (95% CI: 15,074-18,928), more than triple the population estimate in 1978.Estimate of 2011 Abundance of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas Bowhead Whale Population (2013). This study puts the yearly growth rate at 3.7% (95% CI = 2.8-4.7%) from 1978 to 2011. These data suggest that the Western Arctic bowhead stock may be at or near its precommercial whaling level. Alaskan Natives continue to hunt small numbers of bowhead whales for subsistence purposes. The Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission co-manages the bowhead subsistence harvest with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Alaskan villages that participate in the bowhead subsistence harvest include Barrow, Point Hope, Point Lay, Wainwright, Nuiqsut, Kaktovik, Gambell, Savoonga, Kivalina, Wales, and Little Diomede. The annual subsistence harvest of the Western Arctic stock has ranged from 14 to 72, amounting to an estimated 0.1-0.5% of the population.  Baffin Bay and Davis Strait  In March 2008, Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans stated the previous estimates in the eastern Arctic had undercounted, with a new estimate of 14,400 animals (range 4,800‚Äì43,000).Eastern Arctic bowhead whales not threatened. Cbc.ca (16 April 2008). Retrieved on 15 September 2011. These larger numbers correspond to prewhaling estimates, indicating the population has fully recovered. However, if climate change substantially shrinks sea ice, these whales could be threatened by increased shipping traffic.Laidre, Kristin (22 January 2009) \\"Foraging Ecology of Bowhead Whales in West Greenland.\\" Monster Jam. Northwest Fisheries Science Center, Seattle. The status of other populations is less well known. About 1,200 were off West Greenland in 2006, while the Svalbard population may only number in the tens. However, the numbers have been increasing in recent years.Norwegian Polar Institute.

Registrelep- sararegistry.gc.ca. Retrieved on 5 November 2016. More likely, the number of whales that actually inhabit Hudson Bay is much smaller than the total population size of this group,Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin bowhead whales, Stock status report E5‚Äì52. DFO Science, Canada and despite current population size is rather unclear, reports from local indigenous people indicate this population is at least increasing over decades. Larger portions of the bay are used for summering, while wintering is on smaller scale where some animals winter in Hudson Strait most notably north of Igloolik Island and northeastern Hudson Bay. Distribution patterns of whales in this regions are largely affected by presences of killer whales, and bowheads can disappear from normal ranges due to recent changes in killer whales' occurrences within the bay possibly because of changes in movements of ice floes by climate change. Whaling grounds in 19th century covered from Marble Island to Roes Welcome Sound and to Lyon Inlet and Fisher Strait, and whales still migrate through most of these areas. Mostly, distribution within Hudson Bay is restricted in northwestern part along with Wager Bay, Repulse Bay, Southampton Island (one of two main know summering areas), Frozen Strait, northern Foxe Basin, and north of Igloolik in summer, and satellite tracking indicates that some portions of the group within the bay do not venture further south than such as Whale Cove and areas south of Coasts and Mansel Islands. Cow ‚Äì calf pairs and juveniles up to in length consist of majority of summering aggregation in northern Foxe Basin, while matured males and noncalving females may use the northwestern part of Hudson Bay. Fewer whales also migrate to the west coast of Hudson Bay and Mansel and Ottawa Islands. Bowhead ranges within Hudson Bay are usually considered not to cover southern parts, but at least some whales migrate into further south such as at Sanikiluaq and Churchill river mouth. Congregation within Foxe Basin occurs in a well-defined area at north of Igloolik Island to Fury and Hecla Strait and Jens Munk Island and Gifford Fiord, and into Gulf of Boothia and Prince Regent Inlet. Northward migrating along western Foxe Basin to eastern side of the basin also occurs in spring. Whale spyhops in Ulbansky Bay, northwestern Okhotsk Sea  Sea of Okhotsk  Not much is known about the endangered Sea of Okhotsk population. To learn more about the population, these mammals have been regularly observed near the Shantar Islands, very close to the shore, such as at Ongachan Bay. Several companies provide whale-watching services, which are mostly land- based. According to Russian scientists, this total population likely does not exceed 400 animals. Scientific research on this population was seldom done before 2009, when researchers studying belugas noticed concentrations of bowheads in the study area. Thus, bowheads in the Sea of Okhotsk were once called \\"forgotten whales\\" by researchers. WWF welcomed the creation a nature sanctuary in the region Possibly, vagrants from this population occasionally reach into Asian nations such as off Japan or the Korean Peninsula (although this record might be of a right whale). First documented report of the species in Japanese waters was of a strayed infant () caught in Osaka Bay on 23 June 1969, and the first living sighting was of a juvenile around Shiretoko Peninsula (the southernmost of ice floe range in the Northern Hemisphere) on 21 to 23 June 2015.„Éõ„ÉÉ„Ç≠„Éß„ÇØ„ÇØ„Ç∏„É©„Åã„ÄÅÁü•Â∫äÊ≤ñÈÅäÊ≥≥ ÂõΩÂÜÖË¶≥ÂØü„ÅØÊ•µ„ÇÅ„Å¶„Åæ„Çå. Asahi Shimbun (23 June 2015) Fossils have been excavated on Hokkaido, but it is unclear whether or not northern coasts of Japan once had been included in seasonal or occasional migration ranges. Genetic studies suggest Okhotsk population share common ancestry with whales in Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas, and repeated mixings had occurred between whales in the two seas.

The population of bowheads in West Greenland and Canada is estimated to be 6,000 and rising, and hunts in this are minimal (<0.001 percent). Both stocks are rising, and the indigenous hunts seem to be self- sustaining. Killer whales are also known predators.Philo, L. M., E. B. Shotts, and J. C.

There is no consensus on the number of deaths by killer whales. Bowheads seek the ice and shallow waters' safety when threatened by killer whales. The Inuit have a word for this behavior to give historical context that this is not a new phenomenon. Global warming is increasing the frequency that killer whales are observed in the far north. A once-rare event, killer whales are now seen more frequently. There are no reports of attacks on bowheads by sharks.

In 1611, the first whaling expedition sailed to Spitsbergen. The whaling settlement Smeerenburg was founded on Spitzbergen in 1619. By midcentury, the population(s) there had practically been wiped out, forcing whalers to voyage into the \\"West Ice\\"‚Äîthe pack ice off Greenland's east coast.

In 1847, the first bowheads were caught in the Sea of Okhotsk, and the following year, Captain Thomas Welcome Roys, in the bark Superior, of Sag Harbor, caught the first bowheads in the Bering Strait region. By 1849, 50 ships were hunting bowheads in each area. By 1852, 220 ships were cruising around the Bering Strait region, which killed over 2,600 whales. Between 1854 and 1857, the fleet shifted to the Sea of Okhotsk, where 100‚Äì160 ships cruised annually. During 1858‚Äì1860, the ships shifted back to the Bering Strait region, where the majority of the fleet cruised during the summer until the early 20th century. An estimated 18,600 bowheads were killed in the Bering Strait region between 1848 and 1914, with 60% of the total being reached within the first two decades. An estimated 18,000 bowheads were killed in the Sea of Okhotsk during 1847‚Äì1867, 80% in the first decade.Vaughan, R. (1984). Historical survey of the European whaling industry.

Bowheads were first taken along the pack ice in the northeastern Sea of Okhotsk, then in Tausk Bay and Northeast Gulf (Shelikhov Gulf). Soon, ships expanded to the west, catching them around Iony Island and then around the Shantar Islands. In the Western Arctic, they mainly caught them in the Anadyr Gulf, the Bering Strait, and around St. Lawrence Island.

Work Pragmatic data analysis, 1984 = In \\"Pragmatic data analysis\\" (1984) Veryard presented data analysis as a branch of systems analysis, which shared the same principles. His position on data modelling would appear to be implicit in the term data analysis.Graeme Simsion (2001). Data Modeling. p.26. He presented two philosophical attitudes towards data modeling, which he called \\"semantic relativism and semantic absolutism. According to the absolutist way of thinking, there is only one correct or ideal way of modeling anything: each object in the real world must be represented by a particular construct. Semantic relativism, on the other hand, believe that most things in the real world can be modeled in many different ways, using basic constructs\\".Richard Veryard (1984). Pragmatic data analysis. Oxford : Blackwell Scientific Publications. p.7Mehdi Khosrowpour (1999) (ed.). Managing Information Technology Resources in Organizations in the Next Millennium. p. 30. Veryard further examined the problem of the discovery of classes and objects. This may proceed from a number of different models, that capture the requirements of the problem domain. Abbott (1983) proposed that each search starts from a textual description of the problem. Ward (1989) and Seidewitz and Stark (1986) suggested starting from the products of structured analysis, namely data flow diagrams. Veryard examined the same problem from the perspective of data modeling.Grady Booch (1991). Object Oriented Design with Applications: with applications. Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co., 1991. p.151. Veryard made the point, that the modeler has some choice in whether to use an entity, relationship or attribute to represent a given universe of discourse (UoD) concept.Graeme Simsion (2007) Data Modeling: Theory and Practice. p. 78. This justifies a common position, that \\"data models of the same UoD may differ, but the differences are the result of shortcomings in the data modeling language. The argument is that data modeling is essentially descriptive, but that current data modeling languages allow some choice in how the description is documented.\\" = Economics of Information Systems and Software, 1991 = In the 1991 book \\"The Economics of Information Systems and Software\\", edited by Veryard, experts from various areas, including business administration, project management, software engineering and economics, contribute their expertise concerning the economics of systems software, including evaluation of benefits, types of information and project costs and management.Richard Veryard (1991). The Economics of Information Systems and Software. Butterworth-Heinemann. = Information Coordination, 1993 = In the 1993 book \\"Information Coordination: The Management of Information Models, Systems, and Organizations\\" Veryard gives a snapshot of the state of the art around these subjects. \\"Maximizing the value of corporate data depends upon being able to manage information models both within and between businesses. A centralized information model is not appropriate for many organizations,\\" Veryard explains.Richard Veryard (1993). Information Coordination: The Management of Information Models, Systems, and Organizations. Prentice Hall. His book \\"takes the approach that multiple information models exist and the differences and links between them have to be managed. Coordination is currently an area of both intensive theoretical speculation and of practical research and development. Information Coordination explains practical guidelines for information management, both from on-going research and from recent field experience with CASE tools and methods\\". =Enterprise Modelling Methodology= In the 1990s Veryard worked together in an Enterprise Computing Project and developed a version of Business Relationship Modelling specifically for Open Distributed Processing, under the name Enterprise Modelling Methodology/Open Distributed Processing (EMM/ODP).Richard Veryard and Ian G. MacDonald (1994). \\"EMM/ODP: A methodology for federated and distributed systems\\".

EMM/ODP proposed some new techniques and method extensions for enterprise modelling for distributed systems. =Component-based business= In 2001 Veryard introduced the concept of \\"component-based business\\". Component-based business relates to new business architectures, in which \\"an enterprise is configured as a dynamic network of components providing business services to one another\\".Richard Veryard (2001). Component-based Business: Plug and Play. Springer. In the new millennium there has been \\"a phenomenal growth in this kind of new autonomous business services, fuelled largely by the internet and e-business\\". The concept of \\"component-Based Business constitutes a radical challenge to traditional notions of strategy, planning, requirements, quality and change, and tries to help you improve how you think through the practical difficulties and opportunities of the component-based business\\". This applied to both hardware and software, and to business relationships. Veryard's subsequent work on organic planning for SOA has been referenced by a number of authors.Michael Bell, SOA Modeling Patterns for Service-Oriented Discovery and Analysis (Wiley 2010); Tony Bidgood, ArchiMate: A Standard for Enterprise System Modelling (CBDI Journal, August 2008); Marc Lankhorst et al, Enterprise Architecture at Work (Springer, 2005) = Six Viewpoints of Business Architecture, 2013 = In \\"Six Viewpoints of Business Architecture\\" Veryard describes business architecture as \\"a practice (or collection of practices) associated with business performance, strategy and structure.\\"Veryard (2013, p. i) And furthermore about the main task of the business architect: > The business architect is expected to take responsibility for some set of > stakeholder concerns, in collaboration with a number of related business and > architectural roles, including :‚Ä¢ business strategy planning, business > change management, business analysis, etc. :‚Ä¢ business operations, business > excellence, etc. :‚Ä¢ enterprise architecture, solution architecture, > data/process architecture, systems architecture, etc. Conventional accounts > of business architecture are often framed within a particular agenda - > especially an IT-driven agenda.

December 1892 The New Jersey and New York Railroad (NJ&NY;) was a railroad company that operated north from Rutherford, New Jersey, to Haverstraw, New York beginning in the mid-to-late 19th century.Please see the 1891 maps of West Haverstraw and Haverstraw village at:  History  The line was originally chartered as the Hackensack and New York Railroad (H&NY;) in 1856. The H&NY; would eventually run from Rutherford to Hackensack, New Jersey. In 1866 under the leadership of David P. Patterson the company was rechartered as the Hackensack and New York Extension Railroad and it extended its line north of Hackensack. It later reorganized as the New Jersey and New York Railroad. The line reached the town of Haverstraw, New York by 1870, the village of West Haverstraw by 1873, and the village of Haverstraw by 1887. The NJ&NY; was in turn leased for 99 years by the Erie Railroad in 1896. The NJ&NY; continued to exist as an Erie subsidiary until the 1960 merger that created the Erie Lackawanna Railroad. In 1976 the Erie Lackawanna was merged with several other railroads to create Conrail. In 1983, after several years under operation by Conrail, operations of the Pascack Valley Line were transferred to New Jersey Transit Rail Operations. The segments of the two former railroad lines in New York ‚Äì north of Spring Valley to Haverstraw and north of Nanuet to New City ‚Äì are no longer in service. In 1956, NJ&NY; reported 4.4 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 21 million passenger-miles on 39 miles of railroad. Stations A typical NJ&NY; station in the 1900s or 1910s had a gable or hip roof and often had board and batten siding. The larger and more elaborate station at Hillsdale served as the company headquarters and was built in a mixture of the Second Empire and Stick-Eastlake architectural styles.

Currently owned by Penn Jersey Advance, Inc., its offices are in Raritan Township. It is one of the largest paid weekly newspapers in New Jersey, with an estimated total circulation of more than 21,000. It is published every Thursday., History The first newspaper to serve Hunterdon County was the Hunterdon Gazette and Farmers' Weekly Advertiser, established at Flemington on March 24, 1825, by Charles George, who shortened the paper's title to the Hunterdon Gazette in 1829. He discontinued the Gazette on May 2, 1832, but retained his shop in Flemington and periodically published issues of the paper. George sold the Gazette to John S. Brown, who returned the paper to weekly publication beginning with his first issue, published on July 18, 1838. On the Gazette's editorial page, Brown state that he was \\"'an old-fashioned Democrat,' which was in reality an admission that he was a Whig and opposed to the Jacksonian administration.\\" While the Gazette retained a strong readership among Whigs and independents, Hunterdon County had become Democratic with the election of Andrew Jackson as president in 1828. In 1838, the same year that Brown bought the Gazette, a rival newspaper appeared under the name Hunterdon Democrat. The Democrat's editor, George C. Seymour, ensured that his newspaper held to the principles of the Democratic Party. Within months, the rival editors began making personal attacks on each other in addition to their sniping on political topics. However, it \\"took more than politics to support a newspaper. The fight between Brown and Seymour was essentially one of trying to win readers and advertisers.\\" In 1843, Brown sold the Gazette to John R. Swallow. The new owner hired Henry C. Buffington as editor. Earlier in his career, Huffington had worked at Philadelphia area newspapers with Seymour, the Democrat's owner and editor. \\"Seymour did not welcome his old colleague to Flemington\\" and within months he initiated a new personal feud. Early in 1844, Swallow sold the Gazette to Buffington, then moved to Lambertville where he started a newspaper. This venture lasted only three or four years before Swallow sold out and headed west. \\"In the meantime, Seymour of the Hunterdon Democrat and Buffington of the Hunterdon Gazettepursued their respective ways without much change or improvement. ... Actually, both editors were probably skating on thin financial ice at all times.\\" In 1852 Seymour sold the Democrat to Adam Bellis, also a staunch Democrat. On July 3, 1867, The Hunterdon County Democrat made its debut, taking the place of both The Hunterdon Democrat and the erstwhile Gazette (which had changed its name to The Democrat after having been transformed into a Democratic paper in 1866). The editor during this time was Robert J. Killgore. His son, Anthony Killgore, later took over the editorship, serving until 1922. Alex L. Moreau and D. Howard Moreau then became the owners of The Democrat. Following the death of A.L. Moreau in 1933, D. Howard Moreau became sole owner of the newspaper, until his death on June 7, 1963. After Moreau‚Äôs death his son-in-law H. Seely Thomas Jr. became publisher of The Democrat. Thomas hired Edward J. Mack as editor of the newspaper in 1965. Family ownership continued in the 1980s when Thomas was joined in the publication of the newspaper by his three children, Catherine, John, and Howard. Catherine‚Äôs husband, Jay Langley, became editor in 1988, while Mack rejoined the newspaper in 1989 as general manager. Catherine Langley succeeded her father as publisher after his death in 1994. In February 2001, Penn Jersey Advance, Inc., a unit of Advance Publications (Newhouse), bought The Democrat and its sister publications. Based in Somerville, New Jersey, Penn Jersey Advance is the parent company of NJN Publishing, a network of newspapers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Sister publications The Democrat purchased The Frenchtown Star in 1932, which had been published in Frenchtown since 1879, and renamed it The Delaware Valley News. In 1949 The Milford Leader was also purchased and combined with The Delaware Valley News. The newspaper was shut down in September 2008. The Democrat launched a free- circulation weekly newspaper, The Hunterdon Observer, in August 1987. Another free weekly, The Warren Reporter, serves Warren County. A monthly magazine, Horse News, is also a member of The Democrat's publishing group. Penn Jersey Advance bought The Delaware Valley News, The Hunterdon Observer, The Warren Reporter, and Horse News in its 2001 acquisition of The Democrat.

Creation The creation of the Conservatoria delle Coste was inspired by the British National Trust, and foremost by the French Conservatoire du littoral. The Conservatoria was created by the Autonomous Region of Sardinia as an independent agency. His organs are the Scientific Committee, the Executive Director and the Board of Auditors. Currently the Executive Director is Dr. Alessio Satta. The headquarters of the Regional Agency for Coastal Conservation of Sardinia is in the City of Cagliari Mission Sardinian coasts are composed by cliffs, islands and sand dunes, which are the result of geology, weather conditions and exposure to the ever-pounding sea. The agency manages some of the most beautiful locations belonging to the Sardinian historical and cultural heritage: lighthouses, harbours, towers and past archaeological sites. The Conservatoria acquires the most fragile and delicate territories by donations, by pre-emption in or, from time to time, by direct purchase. After ensuring all the restoration work, the Conservatoria can manage the areas by itself or entrusts the management to local authorities or other local groups or organisations. The Conservatoria determinates how the sites should be managed and what activities (such as agricultural or turistic activities) are compatible with its goals. The main objective of the Agency Conservatoria delle Coste is to ensure a sustainable development of coastal areas through an integrated management system and in particular the implementation of the Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Sardinia coastal areas under the institutional framework of the International Protocol and the European Union recommendation on coastal management. The agency works in collaboration with the Priority Actions Programme and Regional Activity Centre of the Mediterranean Action Plan of UNEP to better manage Sardinian coastal zones, improving an integrated approach of the decision processes, able to take into account geographical, political, environmental, social, cultural, historical and economical aspects. This process, as well as the emerging coastal environmental challenges are being dealt, together with other Mediterranean countries . The Conservatoria delle Coste carries out four specific priorities: =Priority 1: Conservation and local development= * conservation and valorisation of Sardinian historical coastal heritage * scientific applied research on coastal and marine ecosystems * implementation of sustainable local development strategies in partnership with coastal municipalities * support and promotion of sustainable tourism, fishing and agriculture activities =Priority 2: Integrated Coastal Zone Management= * coordination and planning actions * strategies for adaptation to climate change * actions for strengthening coastal areas natural resilience * coastal erosion risk mitigation strategies and monitoring =Priority 3: Awareness Raising and Environmental Education= * communication and public awareness * environmental education for primary and high schools * activities for the children, like street theatre and environmental games * photo and video contests organized through cooperation with local authorities =Priority 4: International Cooperation= * international cooperation activities within the framework of the coastal integrated management, climate change and sustainable tourism Images Images of the Sardinian coast.

While in Chile in the early 1950s, he analysed and explained the formation of snow penitents in the Andes, which marked his first contribution to glaciology. He founded in Grenoble in 1958 the Laboratory of Alpine Glaciology and headed it for 25 years; he also set up at that period a pioneering syllabus in geophysics. His contributions to mechanics of viscous media (such as ice and the Earth's mantle) and to geodynamics are internationally acknowledged.  Biography  Early years = Louis A. F. Lliboutry was born in Madrid on 19 February 1922, the son of French parents originating from the Perpignan region. Repatriated in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, he soon revealed his interest for research and exploration, instilled by Jules Verne's novels, while Jean-Henri Fabre's Souvenirs entomologiques led him to observe and collect insects. He also remembers his early passion for Meccano, which perhaps explains why he later became a researcher in mechanics.Lliboutry 1999, op. cit., chap. 1. After high-school studies in Perpignan and Montpellier, he entered during the German Occupation the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, a French grande √©cole in Paris. In April 1945 he passed an agr√©gation in physics where he tied for third place. Louis N√©el, later a Nobel laureate in physics, proposed to Lliboutry a position of teaching assistant in his laboratory in Grenoble. While preparing there his doctorat d'√âtat, Lliboutry discovered mountaineering and climbed many peaks in the Savoy and Dauphin√© Alps. He recalls it was in August 1945, during a stay at the \\"√âcole de haute montagne\\" (Mountaineering School) in Chamonix, that he first cut steps in the ice of the Bossons Glacier and he realized he was ‚Ä≥climbing on water‚Ä≥. In June 1950 he defended his thesis on the variations in magnetization of a steel bar under shocks and strain. N√©el acknowledges him as a peerless collaborator, ‚Ä≥inventive, bright, slightly temperamental‚Ä≥. However Lliboutry could not see himself flourishing in his former patron's laboratory, and he avows he came within an ace of renouncing an academic career. Through the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he managed to get a several-years' temporary leave to train high-school teachers at the University of Chile. He took up his duties in Santiago in March 1951. = Andean years = He soon contacted the Club alpin fran√ßais which was at that time preparing an expedition to the Fitz Roy (), a still unconquered Argentine summit in the Patagonian Andes. As the scientist of the expedition, he had twice the opportunity to meet Juan Per√≥n at the Casa Rosada: for logistics when they headed south, and for a decoration when they returned. While staying at the base camp, he made a new topographic survey of the surrounding area, then poorly mapped on Argentine documents which showed very approximate elevations. He climbed twice to Camp III, below the summit, which was reached by Lionel Terray and Guido Magnone in February 1952 after more than a month's approach and waiting.Lliboutry 1999, op. cit., chap. 3. R√≠o Blanco, in Argentina. His duties at the \\"Pedag√≥gico\\" (Pedagogical Institute) of the University of Chile left him enough time to explore the High Andes of Santiago where some glaciers, especially rock glaciers, were not mapped yet. The topographical survey he carried out will still be used nearly forty years later. In March 1952, about above sea level in Nevado Juncal close to Aconcagua, he first observed snow penitents, mysterious structures already encountered by Charles Darwin and attributed by natives to carving of n√©v√© by strong winds. Lliboutry qualitatively explained their formation, due to complex phenomena of melting and infrared-radiation re-emitted by the penitents. This marks his first important contribution to glaciology. Lliboutry spent his last year in Chile (1955) writing a book of nearly 500 pages, Nieves y glaciares de Chile, which foreshadowed the two volumes of his future Trait√© de glaciologie (more than 1,000 pages). In the following decades, his expertise in glaciology and geophysics will be called upon several times in Latin America, notably by the Peruvian government and UNESCO, before and after the Yungay disaster (a debris flow caused by the outburst of lakes near the Huascar√°n Glacier, making 20,000 casualties on 31 May 1970).Lliboutry 1999, op. cit., chap. 8. = The glaciologist = He returned to France in 1956 where he secured a position of associate professor with the Grenoble University. He soon entered into contact with Paul-√âmile Victor at the French Polar Expeditions, and also with various Swiss, American, and Canadian institutes involved in glaciology.Lliboutry 1999, op. cit., chap. 5. During the next decade, Lliboutry roamed Greenland and Spitsbergen, but the new \\"Laboratory of Alpine Glaciology\\" he founded in Grenoble in 1958 will first focus its interest on the near-by Alpine glaciers.Lliboutry 1999, op. cit., chap. 7. The laboratory founded in 1958 changed its name twenty years later to Laboratory of Glaciology and Geophysics of the Environment, which Lliboutry will head until 1983; then, in 2017 (ten years after his death), to Institute of Geosciences of the Environment, incidentally losing its specificity of glaciology. = The geophysicist = As early as the 1950s, Lliboutry became interested in the Earth's internal structure, and it is remarkable that book chapters and monographs he wrote between 1973 and 2000 are more devoted to geodynamics than glaciology. He notices that the Earth's mantle, even if it deforms a million times slower than glaciers, finally presents with ice a much greater analogy than what can be established between ice and more usual viscous fluids which deform a thousand billion times more quickly.Lliboutry 1999, op. cit., chap. 10. In Grenoble, he set up in 1959 at the master level a new syllabus in general geophysics which will flourish in the 1960s when the Earth's sciences will be refounded by the plate tectonics \\"theory\\". Two articles published in 1969 and 1970 on the modelling of convection within the Earth's mantle showed him, with Claude All√®gre, Xavier Le Pichon and Dan McKenzie, in the very closed circle of European scientists at the leading edge of the new theory. He was the first to notice that the viscosity of the asthenosphere, due to partial melting (of the order of one percent), is analogous to what happens in so-called \\"temperate glaciers\\" where ice is also partially melted in the same order of magnitude, with the coexistence of a liquid phase and a solid phase. He also modelled the postglacial rebound of the lithosphere as observed in Fennoscandia or Canada following the disappearance of Quaternary ice caps, which allowed him to infer the mechanical properties of the Earth's mantle, its rheology and its viscosity. On a different note, his most original publication is probably an article published in 1974. Plate kinematics arbitrarily consider one of the lithospheric plates constituting the Earth's surface (usually the Antarctic Plate) as fixed, and the movement of other plates is described relative to it. \\"Absolute\\" movements are much more difficult to determine; to achieve this, one usually makes use of hot spots, supposed time-invariant while plates drift over them. Starting from a \\"simple\\" principle (the resulting moment of the absolute velocities of the plates on the Earth as a whole is a null vector), Lliboutry managed to compute this absolute movement for all the plates known in his time, without having to involve the \\"hot spots referential\\". Both approaches are remarkably consistent.  Distinctions and legacy  From 1976 to 1980, he has presided the European Geophysical Society, then, between 1983 and 1987, the International Commission on Snow and Ice, an emanation of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences. Elected an honorary member of the International Glaciological Society, he was the 1993 recipient of the Seligman Crystal, a prize granted by this Society for major breakthroughs in glaciology (one recipient every two years on the average). In Chile, the mountain Cerro Lliboutry (), close to the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, was named in his honour. First climbed in 2005, it is henceforth designated as el Lliboutry in Chilean mountaineering guidebooks.andeshandbook.org His name was also officially given in 1983 to the Lliboutry Glacier, which flows from the Boyle Mountains to the Bourgeois Fjord in the Antarctic Peninsula. Louis Lliboutry was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur (Chevalier) in 1991 and the Palmes acad√©miques (Commandeur) in 1977.Turrel M., op. cit., p. 286 A recent book in FrenchTurrel M., op. cit. recalls how he contributed to launch modern glaciology.

She is the former wife of footballer Paul Gascoigne and the mother of glamour model Bianca Gascoigne. Her television career includes a presenting role on ITV1's Loose Women, and she appeared as a contestant on the tenth series of the UK version of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! Life and career Sheryl Gascoigne rose to prominence because of her high-profile relationship, and later marriage, to footballer Paul Gascoigne. Having met in around 1990, they were married in Hatfield, Hertfordshire in July 1996. However, the marriage was a turbulent and ultimately short-lived one, ending in divorce in August 1998. Paul had experienced difficulties with alcoholism and had been abusive towards his wife. In a July 1994 interview with a Sunday newspaper Paul Gascoigne admitted beating Sheryl on a regular basis for two years. The couple later tried to reconcile but without success. Following her divorce in 1998 Sheryl Gascoigne campaigned for victims of domestic violence, and became a television personality. Among her credits include presenting role on ITV1's Loose Women and appearances in numerous television documentaries. In 2010 she appeared on series ten of I'm a Celebrity Get...Me Out of Here! Having turned down an offer to appear on the programme earlier in the year, she was persuaded to join after one of the other contestants, Gail Porter was forced to drop out, and she was allegedly offered a higher fee to take part. She was the first contestant to be voted off after 13 days. In 2009 she published a book, Stronger: My Life Surviving Gazza, an autobiographical account of her marriage to Gascoigne in which she made claims about his violent behaviour towards her. She later said she wrote the book in response to accounts her former husband had published about their life together. The News of the World later featured a story under the title \\"You Lying Bitch!\\" giving Paul Gascoigne's reaction to the book. Sheryl Gascoigne subsequently sued the newspaper for libel and was awarded an undisclosed amount of compensation in at the High Court in May 2010. In November 2011 she gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry, established to examine the activities of the media following the News International phone hacking scandal. She told the inquiry she had been portrayed as a gold-digger by the press, but that her ex-husband's advisers had urged her not to take legal action. She said the media had \\"constantly\\" followed her while she was pregnant and that on another occasion she had been forced to crawl around her house on her \\"hands and knees\\" to avoid press taking photographs of her through the windows. She said her children also found the media interest difficult. Personal life She has two children, Bianca and Mason, from her marriage to Colin Kyle, and a son, Regan, from her marriage to Paul Gascoigne. He adopted Sheryl's two children from her first marriage, and they took his surname. They have claimed that he beat them as well.Profile: Paul Gascoigne , The Guardian, 24 February 2008 Bianca has appeared on reality TV show Love Island ReferencesExternal links * Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:British television personalities Category:I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

Criticas y semblanzas is a collection of articles in Spanish by Ramon Dom√®nec Per√©s i Per√©s, most published in La Vanguardia between 1888 and 1892, and published as a volume in 1892. Analysis Per√©s defends (as in his Literary Criticism in Catalonia, of 1883) the exercise of criticism based on information and intellectual competence, for which he cites authorities like Paul Bourget, Goncourt, Matthew Arnold, Henry James, Alas and Pardo Bazan, among others. He discusses Men√©ndez Pelayo and Frederic Soler, the recent work of Palacio Vald√©s, P√©rez Galdos, Juan Valera, Mestres, Verdaguer, Pin i Soler and Bosch de la Trinxeria, and two translations into Spanish, of Heine and of Pindar. He sometimes drifts from the dominant belief that realism and modernity are synonymous, in such a way that one can see (for example in the pages devoted to Galdos) the unconscious signs of the exhaustion of the Realist rhetoric. Per√©s is interested in looking at Catalan literature from the perspective of the Spanish. With a spirit that evokes that of the critic Yxart, he draws a portrait in which Catalan literature is praised for its evocative realism, in an analysis that is neither condescending nor pejorative, even in line with Renaixen√ßa readings. The Catalan literary establishment is taken to task for some rigidity in their habits of production and consumption, as well as for an abusive protectionism, that nonetheless does not in any way take away from the intense creativity of a Mestres or a Verdaguer. Addressing a number of questions (the novel as a demand of economy and coherence, the idea of poetry, the value of translations in literary life, doubts about the literary value of the work of Soler, Verdaguer as an ancient poet), the volume highlights the extraordinary value of the narrative of Galdos and of the poetry of Mestres. The collection obtained favourable reviews in the press of both Barcelona and Madrid.Diccionari de la Literatura Catalana, 2008 NotesReferences * Enciclop√®dia.cat - Ramon Dom√®nec Per√©s i Per√©s Category:Spanish literature Category:1892 books ","title":"A dos vientos.

Commonly referred to as F. G. O. Stuart, he was born in Braemar, Aberdeenshire. Stuart worked as a photographer in Aberdeen and London, before settling in Southampton by about 1881 (appearing in the 1881 census). He is best known as a photographer and publisher of picture postcards, mainly of images of southern England, with the first cards appearing about 1901. On his death in 1923 at home in Southampton, his son-in-law Charles Dowson took over the family business and carried on until the 1930s. Stuart regularly took team photographs in the early days of Southampton Football Club. This was the \\"Golden Age\\" of picture postcards, and over 2500 postcards were produced by Stuart (and later Dowson), primarily depicting images of a topographical nature, often in the Southampton area. Stuart himself (or his pony and cart) can often be seen in the street scenes. Early Stuart postcards were printed in Germany and are renowned for the quality of the print and vibrancy of the colours. With the outbreak of war in 1914, printing moved to England and there was a notable decrease in the quality of the cards produced. Trimmed cards can sometimes be seen where the publisher has trimmed the 'Printed in Germany' mark from the side of the card. During the war Stuart acted as the official port photographer, recording damage to shipping and Southampton docks. Stuart's commercial premises in Southampton were at 57, 59 and 61 Cromwell Road, Southampton. References *A.G.K. Leonard (1992) Southampton In Old Picture Postcards, European Library. * *J.H.

Unlike voting or stacking ensembles, which are multiexpert systems, cascading is a multistage one. Cascading classifiers are trained with several hundred \\"positive\\" sample views of a particular object and arbitrary \\"negative\\" images of the same size. After the classifier is trained it can be applied to a region of an image and detect the object in question. To search for the object in the entire frame, the search window can be moved across the image and check every location for the classifier. This process is most commonly used in image processing for object detection and tracking, primarily facial detection and recognition. The first cascading classifier was the face detector of Viola and Jones (2001). The requirement for this classifier was to be fast in order to be implemented on low-power CPUs, such as cameras and phones.  Algorithm properties  Scaling and rotations = It can be seen from this description that the classifier will not accept faces that are upside down (the eyebrows are not in a correct position) or the side of the face (the nose is no longer in the center, and shadows on the side of the nose might be missing). Separate cascade classifiers have to be trained for every rotation that is not in the image plane (side of face) and will have to be retrained or run on rotated features for every rotation that is in the image plane (face upside down or tilted to the side). Scaling is not a problem, since the features can be scaled (centerpixel, leftpixels and rightpixels have a dimension only relative to the rectangle examined). In recent cascades, pixel value from some part of a rectangle compared to another have been replaced with Haar wavelets. = Stage properties = To have good overall performance, the following criteria must be met: # Each stage must validate all faces, and can produce many false positives. For example, if stage 1 were to mark as 'does not contain a face' 20% of rectangles containing a face (false negative rate=20%), then the total performance of the chain cannot be higher than 80% true positive, whatever the next stages are, since 20% of faces have already been rejected. # This suggests that a good stage must have 100% true positive and for example 40% false positive, that is accept all rectangles containing faces and erroneously mark many rectangles as potentially containing a face, to be eliminated by later stages. For a first stage, 100% true positive and 40% false positive still gives a lot of false negative, if only 1 in a 1000 rectangles in an image contain a face, there will still be 400 to 1 false possible faces after the first stage. # If the first stage is very fast (a few operations), we have eliminated 60% of rectangles not containing a face very quickly. The training procedure for one stage is therefore to have many weak learners (simple pixel difference operators), train them as a group (raise their weight if they give correct result), but be mindful of having only a few active weak learners so the computation time remains low. The first detector of Viola & Jones had 38 stages, with 1 feature in the first stage, then 10, 25, 25, 50 in the next five stages, for a total of 6000 features. The first stages remove unwanted rectangles rapidly to avoid paying the computational costs of the next stages, so that computational time is spent analyzing deeply the part of the image that have a high probability of containing the object. = Cascade training = Cascades are usually done through cost-aware ADAboost. The sensitivity threshold (0.8 in our example) can be adjusted so that there is close to 100% true positives and some false positives. The procedure can then be started again for stage 2, until the desired accuracy/computation time is reached. After the initial algorithm, it was understood that training the cascade as a whole can be optimized, to achieve a desired true detection rate with minimal complexity. Examples of such algorithms are RCBoost, ECBoost or RCECBoost. In their most basic versions, they can be understood as choosing, at each step, between adding a stage or adding a weak learner to a previous stage, whichever is less costly, until the desired accuracy has been reached. Every stage of the classifier cannot have a detection rate (sensitivity) below the desired rate, so this is a constrained optimization problem. To be precise, the total sensitivity will be the product of stage sensitivities. Cascade classifiers are available in OpenCV, with pre-trained cascades for frontal faces and upper body. Training a new cascade in OpenCV is also possible with either haar_training or train_cascades methods. This can be used for rapid object detection of more specific targets, including non-human objects with Haar-like features. The process requires two sets of samples: negative and positive, where the negative samples correspond to arbitrary non-object images. The time constraint in training a cascade classifier can be circumvented using cloud- computing methods.  Cascading classifiers in statistics  The term is also used in statistics to describe a model that is staged. For example, a classifier (for example k-means), takes a vector of features (decision variables) and outputs for each possible classification result the probability that the vector belongs to the class. This is usually used to take a decision (classify into the class with highest probability), but cascading classifiers use this output as the input to another model (another stage). This is particularly useful for models that have highly combinatorial or counting rules (for example, class1 if exactly two features are negative, class2 otherwise), which cannot be fitted without looking at all the interaction terms. Having cascading classifiers enables the successive stage to gradually approximate the combinatorial nature of the classification, or to add interaction terms in classification algorithms that cannot express them in one stage. As a simple example, if we try to match the rule (class1 if exactly 2 features out of 3 are negative, class2 otherwise), a decision tree would be: * feature 1 negative ** feature 2 negative *** feature 3 negative -> class2 *** feature 3 positive -> class1 ** feature 2 positive *** feature 3 negative -> class1 *** feature 3 positive -> class2 * feature 1 positive ** feature 2 negative *** feature 3 negative -> class1 *** feature 3 positive -> class2 ** feature 2 positive *** feature 3 negative -> class2 *** feature 3 positive -> class2 The tree has all the combinations of possible leaves to express the full ruleset, whereas (feature1 positive, feature2 negative) and (feature1 negative, feature2 positive) should actually join to the same rule. This leads to a tree with too few samples on the leaves. A two-stage algorithm can effectively merge these two cases by giving a medium-high probability to class1 if feature1 or (exclusive) feature2 is negative. The second classifier can pick up this higher probability and make a decision on the sign of feature3. In a bias-variance decomposition, cascaded models are usually seen as lowering bias while raising variance.

It makes a point of serving food that is very high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol; in other words, food that, if eaten regularly, could cause a heart attack, hence the name.  Theme and menu  The establishment is a hospital theme restaurant: waitresses (\\"nurses\\") and waiters (\\"doctors\\") take orders (\\"prescriptions\\") from the customers (\\"patients\\"). Each patient dons a hospital gown and wrist band before ordering and those who do not finish their meal receive a paddling by one of the \\"nurses\\" with the option to buy the paddle afterwards. The menu is generally themed around items that are exceptionally high in calories and fat. It includes \\"Single\\", \\"Double\\", \\"Triple\\", \\"Quadruple\\", all the way up to \\"Octuple Bypass\\" hamburgers, ranging from of beef (up to about ), all-you-can- eat \\"Flatliner Fries\\" (cooked in pure lard), beer and tequila, \\"butterfat milkshakes,\\" and soft drinks such as Mexican-bottled Coca-Cola made with cane sugar. Customers can also order cigarettes, or candy cigarettes for children. Customers over in weight eat for free if they weigh in with a nurse waitress before eating. Beverages and to-go orders are excluded and sharing food is also not allowed for the free food deal. One of the restaurant's promotions is a reward for customers who finish a Triple or Quadruple Bypass Burger, after which they are placed on a wheelchair and wheeled out to their vehicle by their \\"personal nurse\\".  History  The Heart Attack Grill was founded in 2005 in Tempe, Arizona, by Jon Basso, with the declared intent of serving \\"nutritional pornography,\\" food \\"so bad for you it's shocking.\\" The idea came when writing a marketing thesis about fitness training studios, as he became inspired by stories about his clients cheating on their diets. The Arizona location closed on May 31, 2011, with a Heart Attack Grill opening in Dallas, Texas earlier that month. The Dallas restaurant closed in October 2011 due to non-payment of rent, and the restaurant's official website was scrubbed of any Dallas location information. The Las Vegas location opened in October 2011.  Illnesses and deaths  The restaurant's spokesman, Blair River, died on March 1, 2011, aged 29, from complications of pneumonia. The Arizona location closed shortly thereafter, on May 31, 2011. On February 11, 2012, a customer suffered what was reported to be an apparent heart attack while eating a \\"Triple Bypass Burger\\" at the restaurant. Restaurant owner Jon Basso called 9-1-1 and the customer was taken to the hospital. Reportedly patrons thought it was a stunt and started taking photos. Basso later said, \\"I actually felt horrible for the gentleman because the tourists were taking photos of him as if it were some type of stunt. Even with our own morbid sense of humor, we would never pull a stunt like that.\\" On April 21, 2012, a woman fell unconscious while eating a Double Bypass Burger, drinking alcohol, and smoking. In February 2013, an unofficial spokesman and daily patron, 52-year-old John Alleman, died of an apparent heart attack while waiting at a bus stop in front of the restaurant.Double Bypass Burger & Flatliner Fries with a bottle of Mexican Coke  Reception  Heart Attack Grill has deliberately courted controversy as a marketing strategy. The restaurant has been criticized and drawn complaints for its breastaurant-style portrayal of nurses. The Quadruple Bypass Burger with consists of four half-pound beef patties, twenty strips of bacon, eight slices of American cheese, a whole tomato and half an onion served in a bun coated with lard.
