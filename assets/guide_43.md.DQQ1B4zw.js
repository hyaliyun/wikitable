The transitional nature of the site has been attributed to the large presence of its large assemblage of ostrich eggshell beads and more importantly, the abundance of microlith technology. Because these type artifacts were found within the site it has led archaeologists to believe that the site could provide insight into the origins of the modern human behavior. The cave was originally tested by Ludwig Kohl-Larsen and his wife Margit in their 1934 to 1936 expedition. They found abundant artifacts, rock art, and burials. However, only brief descriptions of these findings were ever published. That being said, work of the Kohl-Larsens has been seen as very accomplished due to their attention to detail, especially when one considers that neither was versed in proper archaeological techniques at the time of excavation. The site has since been reexamined in an effort to reanalyze and complement the work that has already been done, but the ramifications of improper excavations of the past are still being felt today, specifically in the unreliable collection of C-14 data and confusing stratigraphy. The Kohl-Larsen excavation In 1938 Margit Kohl-Larsen returned to Mumba Cave in an effort to obtain a more complete understanding of the site. Although her work was considered a great triumph in African archaeology at the time, more recent work at the site has illuminated issues from the excavation. Most of the problems lie with the lack of study of the site's uncovered artifacts, soil samples, and faunal remains. Additional problems lie in that very little information from the site, most of which is now considered unclear, ended up being published by Ludwig Kohl- Larsen in 1943. Further excavations have revealed that there was a significant disregard for the lithic assemblage at the sites, making it clear that Kohl- Larsen favored large lithics above secondary or tertiary flakes. It has been calculated that only the largest 2% of the stones were collected. However, this is unsurprising since the presence of microliths was not yet realized as a hallmark of the Late Stone Age. All problems considered, archaeologists such as M.J. Melhman have stated that the importance of the site should not be downplayed. Site stratigraphy During the Kohl-Larsen excavation the stratigraphy and levels of the site were determined within its nine by twelve and a half meters area. Depth of the excavation varies between sources as bedrock has said to have been to be reached between nine and eleven meters. The site was divided into six beds that are now recognized as potentially problematic but still used for reference in present work and reanalysis. In later excavations, artifacts from each of the defined beds have been dated using radiocarbon dating techniques. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to confirm and fully understand the site due to heavily mixed deposits from the Kohl-Larsen excavations, few comparable sites, and lack of data on the past environmental conditions. Each bed has been C-14 dated; however, some scholars question these dates. =Bed I= Bed I is referred to as the surface level of the site. It has been noted to contains remnants of obsidian, ostrich eggshell beads, fireplace wood, pottery sherds, and arrowheads that are similar to those fashioned by the Hadza people. =Bed II= Artifacts from Bed II have been dated using radiocarbon to 381 ¬± 91 B.P. Amongst rockfall debris, this bed contains both human and animals bones, including the bones of turtles and fish, some of which have been carved. Other artifacts include ostrich eggshell beads, pottery, obsidian tools, red ochre. =Bed III= Bed III contains a particular rich assemblage with the presence of a kitchen midden made of several animal bones and broken pottery. The bed also includes decorated ostrich eggshell beads and pottery. Additionally several human burials found at the site were discovered within this bed. The ceramic artifacts found in this bed are attributed to a type known as \\"Kansyore Ware\\", associated with hunter/gatherer peoples. Also found were Neolithic \\"Narosura Ware\\" and Iron Age \\"Lelesu Ware.\\" This bed has an associated radiocarbon date of 844 ¬± 78 B.P. =Bed IV= This Bed is recognized by archaeologists as sterile containing a large beach deposit. Dates from available material are 21530 ¬± 320 B.P. =Bed V= This bed contains fossilized bone and considerable rockfall debris. Cultural material recovered includes a grinder and the remains of a colored pigment. M.J Melhman attributed this bed to what he called the transitional \\"Mumba Industry\\" which contains both hallmarks of the Middle and Late Stone Ages. However, after reanalysis of Bed V, several archaeologists have suggested that the assemblages found within are better assigned exclusively to Late Stone Age technology. Radiocarbon dates on artifacts are estimated at 31,070 ¬± 500 B.P. =Bed VI= Bed VI contains the least amount of bone of all beds of the site, all of which are heavily fossilized. However, there is a large amount of naturally occurring raw materials and associated quartz artifacts. Furthermore, stone tools associated with the Sanzako Industry are present within the bed's assemblage. The Sanzako industry includes sided and notched scrapers, as well as are what described as \\"heavy duty\\" choppers and bifaces. Radiocarbon dates on available material are from 19820 ¬± 750 B.P. Lithics Recent archaeological experiments have confirmed that bipolar flaking, a form of lithic reduction, was used in the cave. These experiments further suggest that the site contains evidence for a transitional period between the Middle and Late Stone Age. Bipolar flaking is described as a hammer and anvil technique of stone tool production; it is an expedient process that produces significantly smaller flakes. This process has been an area of particular interest at Mumba, since there are a significant number of these smalls flakes between stratigraphic Beds VI to V and then in a plateau from Beds V to III. It is believed that the increase of bipolar reduction is a response to favorable climate change in the area, which lead to increased populations and thus territorial activities near Mumba which required more time. Faunal remains Mumba's geographic location may have been a strong factor in determining the overall appeal of the site to its past inhabitants. Along with the nearby lake, the cave is surrounded by various types of terrain including the Serengeti Plains to the west, as well as the Mubulu and Yada Highlands to the east. This diversity in environment brings with it an abundance of biodiversity. Presence of tilapia and catfish bones suggests both served as food resources, as well as snails confirmed by the presence of shell middens. These middens also suggests that Lake Eyasi had once reached to just outside the cave. Additionally, after paying closer attention to the faunal remains, several archaeologists have been able to conclude that the Mumba's past inhabitants took advantage of the terrestrial environment as well. Bones of several animals including baboons, rabbits, warthogs, dik-diks, lizards, and snakes have been found at the site suggesting exploitation of the nearby grassland, and terraces. Human remains Upon the excavation of Bed III the remains of eighteen individuals were discovered between 1934 and 1938. This discovery included twelve males, one female, three children, and two unknown individuals ranging from as young as two up to sixty years of age. Later examination of the available cranial remains revealed that these individuals exhibited Negroid characteristics. Further analysis, attention to context, and dating of the remains suggest these individuals lived in the time period between the start of the Late Stone Age to the start of the Iron Age and that they were most likely the makers of the Kansyore Pottery and ostrich eggshell beads found at the site. Contextual significance Mumba is recognized for its potential in providing evidence for a gradual change between the Middle Stone Age and Late Stone Age in Africa. This is an important time period in human evolution, because many scholars believe that between the Middle and Late Stone Age is when the origin of modern human behavior began. Characteristics of modern human behavior include an increase in cognitive ability, evidence for the use of symbolism, and the origin of language. Examples of modern human behavior at the site include the presence of red ochre, the lithic artifacts, the wall art on the caves, and the overwhelming number of ostrich eggshell beads. The idea of Mumba Cave being an example of this transition was supported by M.J. Melhman and his formation of what he called the Mumba Industry that was largely based on the artifacts observed in Bed V. Archaeologists, however, still debate the validity of the Mumba Industry today.

Typically regarded, at the time, one of the earliest slums in Toronto, the neighbourhood was a location where many new immigrants first settled. It was bounded by College, Queen, and Yonge Streets and University Avenue and was centred on the intersection of Terauley (now Bay) and Albert Streets. Population Yiddish butcher shop sign in the Ward, circa 1910 For several decades of the late 19th and early 20th century, it was a highly dense mixed-used neighbourhood where successive waves of new immigrants would initially settle before establishing themselves. Characterized by authorities in the 19th century as a slum, it was the home of refugees from the European Revolutions of 1848, the Great Famine of Ireland, the Underground Railroad, and then refugees from Russia and Eastern Europe. It was the centre of the city's Jewish community from the late 19th century until the 1920s when the Jewish community moved west to Spadina Avenue and Kensington Market and was also, until the late 1950s, the home of the city's original Chinatown, of many of the city's original Black residents centred on the British Methodist Episcopal Church, at 94 Chestnut Street, and of the city's Italian community until it moved west along College Street to Little Italy. The city's Polish, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, and numerous other non-Anglo-Saxon immigrants first established themselves in The Ward. Today, the area is considered a part of what the City of Toronto now calls the Discovery District, the area having been consumed by the central business district. The old neighbourhood has not wholly disappeared. The short restaurant strip on the south side of Dundas Street between University Avenue and Bay Street still retains many buildings which were part of the Ward. The building in the right of the lead photograph in this article is still standing at Dundas and Elizabeth (it is now home to a Japanese restaurant). The YWCA at 87 Elm Street was originally the Toronto House of Industry, a workhouse established in the centre of the Ward in 1848 to serve impoverished residents. Also, a small group of row houses still stands on Elm Street just west of Bay Street, on the south side - possibly the last surviving remnant of the ward's residential character. The area was officially known as St. John's Ward,Escaped slaves helped build T.O. one of the municipal wards that the city was divided into in the 19th century, but it quickly became known simply as \\"The Ward\\".Introduction History Pre- colonialism = The site where the Ward existed is the territory of the Huron- Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River (Ontario First Nations Maps, 2016). The area was also home to the Taddle Creek. Now a buried lake, it would have been a significant gathering spot for Indigenous people. =1800s= The first settler at the area was James Macaulay. He was granted 100 acres of land and divided up the land for houses. The area was named Macaulaytown in his honour. By 1834, the town was absorbed by the city and was renamed St. John's Ward. The house prices were fairly low and the town was considered a pleasant working-class neighbourhood. In the 1830s, Thornton Blackburn‚Äîan African American fugitive slave‚Äîbegan acquiring several properties in the neighbourhood. Blackburn also provided recently arrived fugitive slaves with inexpensive housing. By 1850, many Black families settled in The Ward; five years later, the total Black population grew to 539.Underground Railroad Exhibit: Teacher Resources - Backgrounder to UGRR - Lesson Plan One Reverend Mitchell Harriet Tubman Institute. Accessed on February 28, 2016. The earliest Jewish settlers in Toronto had come from Britain, the United States, or Western Europe. With only a few hundred Jewish citizens in the city, they settled in several neighbourhoods and mostly integrated with the rest of the city. In the 1890s, an influx of Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe began arriving in Toronto. For the several thousand new arrivals, mostly impoverished and unable to speak English, the densely packed houses of The Ward became their new community. The Ward was also home to Toronto's first Chinatown as Chinese railway workers settled along York and Elizabeth Streets north of Union Station. =1900s= The Ward, 1910 The development of the neighbourhood caused much consternation in Toronto, including anti-Semitic riots and government clearance efforts. In 1909, of The Ward were demolished to build the Toronto General Hospital. The neighbourhood also began to change in character. As the Jewish immigrants became more settled, they moved westwards to the Kensington Market area and the Ward increasingly became a centre for Italian immigrants, who were then arriving in great numbers.Zucchi, p. 36. Son to Italian immigrants, Johnny Lombardi was born in The Ward in 1915, and went on to found one of the first multilingual radio stations in Canada, CHIN in 1966. By the 1920s, most Italians had moved west of Bathurst Street and the College-Clinton area had emerged as the city's major Little Italy. By the Second World War, the Ward had become Toronto's first Chinatown. Central Neighbourhood House was established in 1911 as a settlement house to assist new immigrants in the Ward. In 1911, the City of Toronto's Department of Health began an investigation into the Ward. This was initially resisted by the Toronto City Hall, but was eventually overturned by then-newly appointed Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Charles Hastings who commissioned the in-depth study. The 1911 report detailed over 5, 000 homes that contained various health risks, from leaky roofs and peeling wallpaper to overflowing outdoor privies. A section in the report described the severity of overcrowding, due to both a housing shortage and subdivisions by landlords to extract the most money. It was common for the houses in the Ward to have six or more people share a single, \\"filth-ridden\\" room, and for families to build houses in their backyard to fit more people. The shocking report gave rise to various reforms for the Ward that can be seen as bitter sweet: While the response to the report birthed stricter housing regulations, food safety measures and education programs, the report also resulted in the livelihoods of the individuals and the communities in the Ward to be dispersed. Jewish missionary Henry Singer in the Ward. From the 1920s the Ward was slowly demolished as land was expropriated for office towers and hotels, and, most prominently, the first Chinatown, centred on Elizabeth Street, was expropriated in the 1950s to make way for Nathan Phillips Square, named after a mayor of Toronto. Most businesses there moved West to establish what is now considered the \\"old\\" Chinatown, centred at Spadina Avenue and Dundas Street. For many decades, the area was almost wholly commercial and institutional, but recent years have seen a return of residents to what used to be the Ward, with multiple condominium towers being erected in the area.

Bong Air Force Base is an unfinished Air Force base. It was named after World War II aviator Major Richard Ira Bong. The base was intended to be an air defense fighter base for the Chicago and Milwaukee areas. It was conceived in the early 1950s and construction began in the mid-1950s. Construction had barely begun when the base was transferred to the Strategic Air Command. Eventually, the base was considered obsolete as it had become apparent to Air Force officials that the base would be redundant with installations nearby that would soon have space for more units. The base was abandoned in 1959 and disposed of the following year. The base is not to be confused with the planned renaming of Spokane Air Force Base, Washington, as Bong Air Force Base, which was the planned name of that facility until General Muir Fairchild died on active duty in 1950, cementing \\"Fairchild\\" onto the name of the current Fairchild Air Force Base.

The United States Air Force then instructed the Air Defense Command to study the possibility of locating a base which would house two fighter-interceptor squadrons within a 70-mile radius from the city. The aim of the base was to protect the Milwaukee and Chicago areas from attack by Soviet bombers. A survey team then selected a site south of the unincorporated community of Kansasville, Wisconsin. On August 30, 1954, the Air Defense Command requested funds for development of the site. The 56th Fighter- Interceptor Group was scheduled to move to the base as soon as it was completed.AFHRA Document 00464883 5,160 acres of agricultural land was selected in the northwest corner of Kenosha County and an additional 360 acres in neighboring Racine County. Construction had barely begun in 1956 when the Air Defense Command began to doubt the selection of the site. By this time, it was named after the famous aviator Major Richard Ira Bong, a Wisconsin World War II flying ace. Colonel Charles E. Lancaster, the new commander of the command pointed out that new problems in air traffic control would develop and that the community of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, only 18 miles west, protested violently when a site there had been proposed for the location of the United States Air Force Academy. His recommendations were to select a site north of Milwaukee where the location would be beneficial to not only the Air Defense Command, but the Strategic Air Command, which was planned to be the base tenant at the time. Only the drainage system was being built in the middle of 1957 and the acquisition of land was not even complete. At that time, the scheduled date of the moving of the two squadrons was changed to mid-1960. On June 5, 1957, the major command for the base was changed to the Strategic Air Command. The two squadrons that were planned to be located there became tenants at the base. As technology increased, the Air Defense Command was able to reduce its aircraft and continue its strength. One of the O'Hare squadrons was eliminated in 1958 while another was transferred to K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base. During 1956 and 1957, Strategic Air Command devised a program where the units were to be dispersed throughout the country, which in theory would lessen losses from a direct enemy attack. Bong became one of these bases. As a result, the 4040th Air Base Squadron was activated on August 1, 1958, to maintain the base. The base was also assigned to the Eighth Air Force as well. The planned tenants of the base were a bomber wing and an air refueling wing. On January 1, 1959, responsibility for the base was transferred from the Eighth Air Force and 4040th Air Base squadron to the Second Air Force. The tenant 4040th was made up of two servicemen when this move occurred. The Air Force then realized that the units planned for the base could be accommodated at other existing bases. Since the base would no longer be needed, the Air Force announced on October 1 that Bong would be closed. At that date, the asphalt runway was just three days from having the concrete poured over it. That same day, all construction was halted. The 4040th, now made up of 12 servicemen and no civilians was discontinued on December 1, 1959. The decision to close the base was due to the realization that the B-58 Hustler could be accommodated at other bases through the elimination of B-47 Stratojet units ahead of schedule. Bong Air Force Base was declared excess on August 23, 1960. Secretary of the Air Force James H. Douglas, Jr. later explained the decision to close Bong by saying: > \\"Finally we realized that by 1961‚Äì62 when Bong would be ready, we would have > several other medium bomber bases empty of squadrons & we really don't need > Bong.\\" The only military activity that ever occurred at Bong was the training of Special Forces units before they headed over to the Vietnam War.

Lancaster receives the Air Force Commendation Medal for his service as the only commander of the cancelled Bong Air Base. The citation accompanying the medal read in part, \\"Colonel Lancaster demonstrated outstanding leadership and professional ability in successfully accomplishing the function of his inherent responsibilities.\\" Newspaper editorials publish positive responses citing his affability, dedication and the adversity he faced of decisions out of his control. With $15 million ($125 million adjusted for inflation as of 2017) already spent on Bong, it was estimated that it would take another $15 million just to close the door on the episode and get out of existing contracts. Cancellation factorsCost= On May 18, 1959, Representative Henry S. Reuss informed the House of Representatives that he felt the Bong project was \\"shot thru with waste, frills, and extravagance.\\" He further went on to urge the House to \\"put the brakes\\" on \\"non-essential\\" air force expenditures at the nascent base. Among line items he assailed were a proposed massage room, squash courts, hi-fi shop, and a bowling alley. He went on to cite bong's proximity to nearby Racine and Kenosha, and the short drive to Milwaukee or Chicago in either direction. \\"If Bong were being built in the middle of a great desert, or atop a mountain, or in some inaccessible place far from civilized centers, these grandiose plans might be somewhat justifiable.\\" Secretary of the Air Force James H. Douglas told 200 members at a hearing in the Racine County Courthouse on October 8, 1959, that the costs of missiles was another fiscal reason for the cancellation of Bong. Previously, missiles had been considered a development program. At that point in history, missiles had become operational, and the costs were quickly soaring. Citing this shift in priorities, he said the reallocation of funds sprung from an \\"effort to do the most important things and to do the things we must militarily have.\\" He went on to add that the Air Force didn't reach its cancellation decision sooner because of \\"the natural strong reluctance to turn around when we had proceeded so far.\\" =Air traffic congestion= The same advantage to Bong's location was also a disadvantage‚Äîproximity to two urban centers. Placing the jet fighter interceptor base between Chicago and Milwaukee made the base ideal for defending the cities and the area in between, but it also meant putting more airplanes into an already busy air corridor for commercial aviation. O'Hare was considered one of the busiest airports in the world, and the idea of introducing military planes to skies already bustling with passenger planes was not widely embraced. A contentious House debate occurred in July, 1958, when an additional $18.5 million was requested for the air base project. Representative Melvin Laird took exception with the base' location, stating \\"Here is an example where the Air Force bullied its way through the Civil Aeronautics Administration and went ahead and got into this construction program in a very improper location.\\" During that same debate, Representative Charles Boyle called placing the airfield 40 miles from O'Hare and 16 miles from Mitchell \\"the height of folly.\\" He went on to say \\"How in the name of heaven can you go ahead and throw into a project that is obsolete before it leaves the drawing board?\\" Concerned with the proximity of civilian air hubs and the possibility of in-air collisions, he went on to recommend cancelling the base over a year before the consensus aligned with his view. Private airlines expressed concern that the base would force them to reroute flights eight or ten miles out over Lake Michigan to accommodate the air base. The Air Force tried to allay concerns by indicating that intensive flying exercises would not take place at the base. Major General W. P. Fisher indicated in a letter that air base would be fully combat capable and remain on constant ready alert. Roger Sekadlo, manager of Mitchell Field, expressed relief after the announced base cancellation saying \\"Now we will have no intermingling of military jet bombers and passenger planes. That is definitely a better situation for commercial airlines.\\" Newspapers weighed in as well, with the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal adding \\"Vainly did The Journal and others protest that bombers and tankers -- if a new base was needed -- ought to be \\"dispersed\\" to areas where they would not invite attack on already attractive targets and where military planes would not interfere with heavy commercial air traffic nor be interfered with.\\". Representative Flynn accused then vice president Richard Nixon of having been involved with the base's closure after being pressured by private airlines. Nixon, as well as his aides, denied any involvement in the decision. Nixon told a reporter in Chicago \\"I know nothing whatever about this matter and I had nothing to do with it.\\" Representative Melvin Laird would later go on to serve as President Nixon's Secretary of Defense from 1969‚Äì1973. =Obsolescence= In January 1959, Representative Gerald T. Flynn predicted that Bong would be obsolete in 5 to 10 years. He presumed the airfield would no longer be needed once ballistic missiles were more commonly employed for defense, and presumed the air base would be turned into a Milwaukee metropolitan area airport. \\"When the base becomes obsolete, it undoubtedly will be offered for sale as surplus government property.\\" Later that year in March, Representative Henry S. Reuss stated \\"It is perfectly possible that the Bong Base may be obsolete only a few years after its completion. Under the circumstances, it is not too early to start thinking about what might be done with this $83 million airport when the air force does not need it any more.\\" When the base was conceived, the Air Force had a mandate to rapidly build up its manned operations as quickly as possible. The Air Force intended to have 137 air wings scattered throughout the United States by the year 1957. By 1959, the year in which Bong was cancelled, the Air Force had only 103 air wings. The Bong Air Force Base was conceived in 1954 as a jet fighter interceptor base, the same year that the first ICBM was built. Rapid changes in technology changed America's strategic defense strategies. The speed with which missile advances were made created uncertainty surrounding manned bomber operations. The Bomarc missile was making its debut, and America's first long range missiles were turned over to the Strategic Air Command at the Vanderburg Air Force Base in California. When pressed for reasons of the base closure on October 8, 1959, Secretary of the Air Force James H. Douglas opined \\"The facts are, if we try to simplify the problem, our highest priority weapons development -- intercontinental ballistic missile -- is the start of a chain of events that leads to a change of plans that has eliminated Bong.\\" =Ideal target= Concern was voiced that the air base might make an already attractive enemy target even more desirable. The placement of the base meant that anything within a 600-mile radius was considered to be in a direct line of a missile launched from Russia. In March 1959, Colonel George Carnachan, metropolitan Milwaukee Target Area co-chairman for Civil Defense, indicated that the Bong Air Force Base's presence may raise the area to a #1 rating in case of an enemy nuclear strike. \\"There's little doubt strategic bomber base like Bong would be the first thing you'd go for if you were the enemy.\\" Bong's location caused Civil Defense to rethink its evacuation strategy for the cities of Kenosha, Racine and the southern part of Milwaukee County. Previously, residents in the lakeside communities were urged to head west in to Walworth County in case of enemy attack. Placing the air base between the lake and the area of refuge meant evacuees might have to drive directly through the base blast area as no alternative routes would be available. A mock nuclear bombing raid was conducted by Civil Defense on April 17, 1959, as part of the nationwide Operation Alert. Residents of southeastern Wisconsin were informed that an imaginary one megaton bomb would explode over the Bong Air Force Base. Officials claimed that in such a scenario, the nearby city of Racine would experience little to no blast damage, but 100 to 3,000 roentgens of radioactive fallout would cover the city. They further explained that 450 roentgens was sufficient to cause severe sickness or death for those that came in contact with the fallout. Representatives Henry S. Reuss and Charles A. Boyle had gone so far to write a joint letter to President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1958 questioning the advisability of a Strategic Air Command bomber base placed between Milwaukee and Chicago. According to Reuss, \\"we urged the President to halt spending at Bong and to order a full investigation of the project.\\" Missile base claim Representative Gerald T. Flynn stated after a hearing on October 8, 1959, that he and Representative Henry S. Reuss had attended a secret briefing in the fall of 1958 in which \\"eight colonels and two generals\\" explained how the base's primary function would not be that of a bomber base. He alleged that once the bomber was outmoded as an instrument of nuclear weapons delivery, Bong would become a missile base. \\"They told us what the missile would consist of, how it would be fired, and why it was essential to have such a base in that location as a link in the midwest defense,\\" Flynn said. He went on to offer his statement under oath to any governmental investigation committee. Flynn claimed that the Air Force planned on installing on underground facility with 20-foot deep shaft for missiles. Secretary of the Air Force James H. Douglas brushed Flynn's comments aside at hearing by saying \\"I think that Mr. Flynn misunderstood the briefing, ad this isn't a very difficult thing to do sometimes.\\" He explained that the briefing in question was aimed at informing congressmen of the shift from manned bombers to missiles in the future. \\"There was no definite plan to use Bong as a launching site for ballistic missiles.\\" Reporter Robert W. Wells of the Saturday Evening Post would later ask a Pentagon official, John M. Ferry, about the feasibility of turning Bong in to a missile base. ‚ÄúMissile sites are dispersed around ‚Äî not necessarily on ‚Äî existing Air Force bases. The personnel commute between the sites and the parent base. At Bong there wasn‚Äôt yet a completed base on which missile installations could be centered. Besides, there are special problems in converting a base for missile use. The water table is important. The silo for a missile goes down 185 feet below ground.‚Äù  Abandoned airfield  Construction had been taking place for about a year and half when the cancellation came. Several aspects of the base were already taking form when the project was scrapped. = Runway = of aggregate base, four feet deep and tightly compacted, had already been laid for the primary runway and taxiways. The 12,900-foot (3,900 m) asphalt runway was just three days from having the concrete poured over it when the cancellation orders came. S.J. Groves and Sons had completed 71% of the air field work, in addition to 19% of the work complete on alert taxiways, hangar units and airport supports. The Assistant Secretary of Defense indicated that the primary runway cost $750,000, (about $6 million adjusted for inflation in 2017) in federal appropriations. Other costs included a $3,000,000 ($25 million adjusted for inflation in 2017) operational apron, a $1,150,000 (nearly $10 million adjuted for inflation in 2017) hangar apron, $1,500,000 (nearly $13 million adjusted for inflation in 2017) maintenance dock, $2,400,000 (about $20 million adjusted for inflation in 2017) jet hydrants, and a $700,000 (about $6 million adjusted for inflation in 2017) ordinance storage. It is not clear how much of these items were completed before the base was abandoned. =Transmitter building= The transmitter facility, or TACAN, sat south of the primary runway at (42.622387, -88.156294). Information on this structure is scarce, but it is indicated on a mapBackground Information Notes Regarding Former Bong Air Force Base GSA (1PRC): May 2001 furbished by the GSA, on a map in the collection at the Wisconsin Historical Society, and visible in aerial photography up until 1970. The Assistant Secretary of Defense indicated that the navigational control station cost $40,000 (about $340,000 adjusted for inflation in 2017) in federal appropriations. =Receiver building= The receiver facility sat west of the primary runway at (42.627139, -88.187278). Information on this structure is scarce, but it is indicated on a map furbished by the GSA and on a map in the collection at the Wisconsin Historical Society. The facility is visible in aerial photography up until 1970, though it appears to have been stripped or partially dismantled by 1970 and the foundation destroyed or buried after 1980. The Assistant Secretary of Defense indicated that the communications receiver cost $35,000 (about $300,000 adjusted for inflation in 2017) in federal appropriations. = Railroad spur = A $600,000 ($5 million adjusted for inflation in 2017) Soo rail spur, built in 1958, rusted from disuse. It was intended to bring jet fuel and other supplies in to the base. The five- mile railroad split from the Soo line south of Burlington and entered the west end of the base until turning south east of country trunk B. From there, the single track split in to three parallel rail lines for the batch plant. Although a locomotive ran the track once upon completion, the spur never saw a single payload moved on it. The line was dismantled for salvage in 1974. = Water distribution system = A water distribution system with a length of 3.75 miles of varying sizes of class 150 cast iron pipe had been put in place prior to the termination of construction ‚Äì 400 ft of 6-inch, 3,500 ft of 8-inch, 14,800 ft of 12\\" and 1,300 ft of 18-inch pipe. Upward of 25 fire hydrants dotted the prairie landscape. = Sanitary sewer = The sanitary sewer system was incomplete, but some 13,500 feet of 8-inch to 21-inch- diameter lines had been laid. = Storm drainage = Some (approximately 5.5 miles in length) of storm drainage pipe had been installed through 1959. Urban explorers of the late 20th and early 21st century refer to this collection of large concrete pipes as \\"the tunnels\\". A 60-inch-diameter (5 ft) storm drainage system had been built with a 96\\" (8 ft) diameter storm sewer outflow to the Peterson Creek on the south of the property. Most of the 26-inch- diameter manholes or catch basins have long since been capped, either by bulldozers using dirt in the 1960s or metal plates in the early 2000s. Depth of these manholes ranged from 5 ft to . An inventory completed in 2001 indicated that upward of 120 manholes still covered the landscape, though some were only located through the use of a metal detector after being entombed in dirt. = Water treatment plant = Sewage and water treatment plants were planned for the north central area of the base. The sewage treatment plant would be two-story structure with an office and laboratory totaling some in area. The water treatment plant was to be 6,800 square feet in area and would include a ground storage reservoir.A clarification tank was submerged into the ground north of Highway 142 at (42.639000, -88.140806) and never put in to use. The tank has slowly deteriorated into a pond. An additional million- gallon elevated steel tank would have been located on the north side of the base near residential section. The sewage and water treatment facilities were being built by the C & C Construction Company of Fort Wayne, IN and were 14% complete when the cancellation order was announced. = Heating plant = The deserted heating plant and POL storage tanks during the first winter after the base was cancelled. A 3,500 horsepower central heating plant had been erected. The facility was built by the H.R. Reger Company of Chicago throughout 1958 and 1959. The plant was estimated to be 72% complete when the cancellation order came down. The Assistant Secretary of Defense indicated that the heating cost $250,000 (about $2 million adjusted for inflation in 2017) in federal appropriations = Tank farm = Three POL (propellant, oil and lubricants) tanks capable of holding 70,000 barrels of jet fuel and of gasoline sat vacant. The sotrage facility consisted of two 20,000 barrel tanks, one 30,000 barrel tank, and one underground 2,000 barrel tank. The H.R. Reger Company of Chicago once again won the contract and built the facility. The tank farm stood at just south of present-day Highway 142 at (42.632060, -88.133848) on a five acres of land. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers made an effort to lease the tanks after the closure of the base, but they were ultimately never used. = Electrical substation = An electrical switching station sat idle. The station had three 1,667 kVA oil bath transformers and two 6-amp oil circuit breakers. Input of the transformers was rated at 26.4 kVA, with an additional 10 kVA for three circuit 120/240 V. = Army engineer's office = The Keno Construction Company of Highland Park, Illinois, had erected a $100,000 (nearly $1 million adjusted for inflation as of research in 2017) corrugated office at the corner of present-day Highways 142 and 75. The 32 ft x 128 ft prefabricated Butler style building with sheet steel exterior was built during the fall of 1958. The office housed Major General Shumaker and his United States Army Corps of Engineers staff. The engineer's office was the first building erected on the base and the last to be torn down. The structure was later be turned into a school house and ultimately razed in the early 21st century, making it the only above ground air force base structure to survive the base's later conversion into a recreation area. = Hospital and dorms = The Borough Construction Company of New York had complete 10% of their work on a base hospital before the project was cancelled. Similar work on a dorm was only 3% complete. Concrete footings were poured for the dorm but later covered. Some of those foundations are still visible on the Brighton Dale Links golf course at (42.644694, -88.122750). Underground storm sewers were also installed that area. = Roadway disruption = County and state roads had been cut off by the project. Highway 43 (present-day highway 142) was severed where it ran through the base. By 1961, residents inconvenienced by the closure of highway 43 between Burlington and Kenosha eventually battered the air base gates and unofficially reopened the road. Prior to base cancellation, Hwy 75 was intended to be re-routed as a two-lane highway north through the town of Brighton itself. After reaching Hwy 43, it would turn into a four-lane road running north. These plans were scrapped once additional lanes for air base traffic were no longer needed. Hwy 75 instead ran north from a fork just above Klondike and along the former air base's eastern boundary until reconnecting at the intersection next to Brighton Elementary.  Impact  Displaced people = The land comprising the base had once been half-covered in forest with a prairie in its center. Potawatomi, Menomonee and Ojibwa Native Americans had been know to once hunt on the land. European settlers arrived around 1830, driving out the indigenous people and altering the prairie. Arrowheads were sometimes found afterward, and a trail created by the indigenous people once ran through the property in a north‚Äìsouth direction to the east of the pioneer cemetery. All traces of this trail were erased by base construction, as it occupied the area cleared for the runway, taxiway, heating plant and POL area. Rhodesdale farmstead house is moved off base in 1958 The area was first cleared by the Thomas Rhodes family in 1842. Possibly the largest of government land purchases, the family's farm Rhodesdale and 115-years-old during its final year of 1957. Brothers Frank and Clarence, fourth-generation farmers born on the homestead and lived there the entirety of their lives, were informed that they would have to vacate the homestead by November 1957. Collectively, the Rhodes family owned 10% of the land necessary for the government to build. The original farmhouse at (42.645139, -88.129648) was relocated three miles to the northeast corner of County Trunks J and BB along with one barn on March 29, 1958. In total, 59 farm families were displaced. An incomplete list of displaced residents includes the Gruinwall, Ratlidge, Sheahan, Kirkman, Meyer, Wiener, Muller, Ward, Rhodes, Schaefer, Theobold, Vacins, Ericks, and McEtridge families. Many of their homes were razed during construction. Farmers were paid $220 to $300 an acre ($1,952.06 to $2,661.90, adjusted for inflation in November 2017). Farmers felt the government was not giving them a fair price for their land. Some tried protesting, asking nearby residents for help or using litigation to halt the process. Others tried to relocate to land nearby, only to find that prices had skyrocketed on the heels of real estate developers and speculators. Most families sold the moved off of the land. About a dozen families refused to accept the prices offered to them and moved off under condemnation proceedings. Adding to their losses, the displaced farmers were unable to put in their 1957 crops, and were too late to put in new crops on other at other locations. For a variety of reasons, the families were unable to return to their property following the base was aborted and the land was deemed as governmental surplus. 14 million cubic yards of rich farming soil was stripped away by the air base project, making 2,000 acres of prime agricultural land useless for farming after the cancellation of the air base. A 1/4-acre pioneer cemetery on the 40 acre Gill farm dating back to 1887 was reinterred in June 1958 by Earl Spencer. Officials expected to move eight marked graves and possible additional unmarked graves. Lois Stein conducted the research of the graveyard. Nine graves were marked, though a total of 22 bodies would be moved. W. Eddy, Patrick Patterson and one additional body were transferred to Salem Mound Cemetery in Silver Lake. Nineteen others were moved to the Forest Home cemetery in Milwaukee, including Walter Reynolds, Suky Reynolds, Caroline Benson, Jane C. Benson and Roby Sheldon. All of the identifiable graves dated back to the mid 19th-century.Burial Sites Preservation Program, State of Wisconsin B591-0266 BKN0032 (15098) The cemetery sat off of the southeast corner of former County Trunk LM and Brighton Road at (42.625686, -88.148983), between the runway and taxiway just south of the operational apron near a present-day storm sewer. A log cabin built in 1855 by Matt Wallrich was discovered when bulldozers came to raze structures for the runway. The cabin was hidden inside of 20th-century cladding. It was dismantled piece by piece and reassembled by Seabee Unit 9-46 and the Kenosha Historical Society and moved to a park in nearby Silver Lake. The years were not kind to the structure. Vandals, fire and rot eventually deteriorated the cabin to the point that it had to be torn down 35 years after it was saved. Some of the timbers and the plaque were moved back to Brighton and placed near the ball diamond at Wack Park. Today the plaque is attached to a stone, the old wooden timbers long since having rotted away. = Topographical alteration = Trees in the southwest corner of the tract were removed using a slash-and-burn method. Stumps, rocks, concrete rubble and demolished building debris were deposited into dumping grounds in the same area. Topsoil was skimmed from the areas containing the runway apron, central heating pant and POL tank farm and stockpiled in the northwest corner of the base. The southern half of the site had essentially been flattened to create an even grade for the runway. According to a report prepared by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources in 1978, stating \\"Returning this land to agriculture was considered impossible as the topsoil had been stripped.\\" The majority of the former roads passing through the site were never restored, and it would take years to reopen Highway 43 (present-day Highway 142). Locals became fed up with Highway 43's closure, as it was the quickest route between the towns of Kenosha and Burlington. Someone eventually rammed open the gates erected by Army Corps of Engineers, and motorists ignored the \\"US Government ‚Äì Keep off\\" signs. Prior to base cancellation, Highway 75 was intended to be re-routed as a two-lane highway north through the town of Brighton itself. After reaching Hwy 43 (present-day Highway 142), it would turn into a four-lane road running north. These plans were scrapped once additional lanes for air base traffic were no longer needed. Highway 75 would not be restored until four years after the air base was cancelled. Even then, it would not run its old route. The new Highway 75 now split off the old highway at Klondike and run north along the eastern edge of the site until it reconnected to the old highway at Brighton Elementary. = Economic disruption = Map showing the proposed location for the never-built Upland community and re-routing of Hwy 75 $29,000,000 (a quarter of a billion dollars adjusted for inflation in 2017) had already been spent on the base when construction was halted; 59 farm families had been displaced. The town of Brighton lost 23% of its tax valuation, and the school district lost 27% of its tax base. Several entrepreneurs were attracted to the area around the base eager to capitalize on air base-related commerce. Motels were built, including one outside of Union Grove, Wisconsin, simply called \\"Bong Motel\\". The base was to include 900 Capehart housing units built to house military personnel and dependents. Officials expected that additional housing would be necessary by 1962, requiring an estimated 490 housing units built to handle the overflow. Private interests were eager to capitalize on the construction boom. An 1,800-acre property development named \\"Upland\\" was in the works. The community was to be built between Kansasville and Union Grove. The Evanston, Illinois, developers planned for 3,000 privately owned houses, 300 rental houses, 192 apartment units, a 33-store shopping center, a 92-unit motel, a golf course, parks, two elementary schools, a high school and churches. The base cancellation came the day before Scope Associates, Inc. had intended to start buying land. Had it been completed, the new city was projected to have a population of 12,000 to 15,000 residents and cost $55,000,000 (nearly half a billion dollars adjusted for inflation as of 2017). A drive-in was erected by Ted Kostro. The Milwaukee house painter borrowed heavily and sold his house to build \\"the Bow and Arrow\\" on the approach road to the base. The base cancellation was announced on the day of the drive-in's grand opening. = Distrust of the federal government = The acquisition, modification and subsequent abandonment of eight square miles of private land reshaped the public's perception of government agencies, especially among southeastern Wisconsinites. Shock and incredulity swept over the region in reaction to the base's sudden cancellation. \\"I think it is rather tragic that the government should spend so much money for no good purpose,\\" said Edward J. Ruetz, president of the Kenosha National bank. Congressional investigation was demanded. Local politicians railed against the government's decisions, from the closure itself to a lack of foresight beforehand. Representative Henry S. Reusscharged \\"From the beginning, a rank amateur would have been hard-pressed to select a more incongruous location for a strategic bomber base -- in the middle of the most congested air traffic corridors in the nation, and in the heart of an already vital target area for any enemy.\\" Compounding matters, the Air Force refused to finish air base construction projects like the completion of roads, utilities and the power plant. Were these items completed, the property would have more appeal to private investors with an eye on salvaging the base for industrial or commercial friendly proposals. Residents took offense to the government's willingness to spend money prior to the cancellation and its refusal to spend \\"one thin dime\\" to make the site attractive to prospective buyers. As a result, locals were more than eager to \\"get the federal government out of the picture.\\" Residents of Wisconsin would be reminded of the government's mishandling of the project for the next two decades as numerous plans for the abandoned base were considered and red tape barred a swift resolution. The distrust of the federal government would later be transferred to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the state agency that acquired 5,190 acres of the former air base over a decade of legal wrangling. In 1978, Brighton town chairman Lawrence Olsen gave voice to this animosity at a public hearing held at Westosha Central High School regarding the DNR's plan for the area. \\"This has always been a town of Brighton problem. Why weren't we involved in the planning? Why weren't the planning meetings held in Brighton?\\" He went on to charge that officials had \\"no consideration of those who lost the most.\\" The DNR had not yet acquired a remaining 480 acres of school forest land under a managing agreement. Olsen pointed out how the town stood to lose yet another $12,000 a year in Brighton's tax base. Olsen was hardly alone in his disposition. Frances Jaeschke, representing the League of Women Voters, described the abandoned air base as \\"one of the worst fiascos of government bungling.\\" John Vanderwerff, Brighton supervisor, opposed additional land acquisition saying \\"How will the town of Brighton survive? The truth is the DNR doesn't give a damn about the town of Brighton.\\"  Post closure activity  Surplus = Efforts were made to lease, salvage or sell as surplus the parts and facilities left over from the base. H. Turner and Son Boscobel had 14,600 lineal feet of 6-inch cement pipe, 700 linear feet of concrete pipe, 95 frames and grates for manholes, and 14 cast- iron tees and crosses left sitting on the abandoned base. C & C Construction left over 10,000 feet of 6-inch and 10-inch insulated pipe, a 325 GPM water softener, sewage plant equipment, 72-ton reinforcing steel and miscellaneous other items on the base. The U.S Army Corps of Engineers made an effort to sell 16,372 feet of 3\\" electrical fibre duct and fittings, 34,0000 pounds of number 4, 5, 6 and 8 reinforcing bars, miscellaneous fabricated cages, forms, metal grates and manhole covers, 1,420 ft of 8 inch diameter Helcor pipe, miscellaneous concrete paving supplies, miscellaneous airport paving forms, 2,400 liner feet of corrugated metal pipe of 6 inch and 36 inch diameters, 700 linear feet of corrugated metal pipe of 12 inch and 15 inch diameters, 15,200 linear feet of black seamless coated pipe of 2 inch and 10 inch diameters, miscellaneous fittings for black seamless coated pipe, and eight 50,000 gallon steel tanks. Several attempts were made to repurpose the air base, including use as a commercial park and consideration as a civilian airport. Above ground structures such as the heating plant and POL tank farm were eventually torn down. The railroad spur was declared a total loss and removed in 1974 once it was clear no industrial park would be placed on the grounds. The majority of the land sat dormant until its designation as a state park in 1974. = Airdrop exercises = The military occasionally used the abandoned airfield for exercises. One such exercise took place on July 1, 1961, when the 82nd Airborne conducted airdrop practice maneuvers. 240 soldiers from Company C of the 1st Airborne Battle Group, 503 Infantry, parachuted into Bong as 25,000 spectators watched. Six C-119 Flying Boxcars flew in at an altitude of 2,300 feet dropping 20 men per pass. Each plane made two passes with troops. Winds were gusting at 20 mph, causing some of the paratroopers to drift in to the wooded area in the north part of the base. Three minor injuries were reported. The C119s followed the troop drop by delivering two jeeps and a 105mm howitzer from the air. A helicopter carrying seven skydivers from the 82nd Airborne was unable to climb to 7,200 feet for a planned delayed opening jump. The Green Berets conducted a mass paratrooper jump exercise over Bong on March 16, 1968. 190 paratroops from the US Army Reserve's 12 Special Forces group joined members of the Air Force Reserve's 928th Tactical Airlift group in a simulated combat airdrop. The troops flew once again on C-119 Flying Boxcars out of O'Hare International Airport. No one was hurt during this jump. Another exercise took place on August 3, 1968. The 440th Tactical Airlift Wing flew out of General Mitchell Field in Milwaukee on a corridor mission. The C-119 Flying Boxcar was to drop jeeps along with 55-gallon drum of water to simulate fuel. High winds led to a cancellation of the mission. = Biernat slaying = The base sat in disuse for many years following the cancellation of the project. Four years after the base was cancelled, Kenosha business man Anthony J. Biernat's body was discovered on the north side of the abandoned base following a gangland killing. Biernat, a jukebox distributor, was said to have been beaten to death after a Chicago syndicate ordered the mob in Milwaukee to muscle in on his Great Lakes Naval Base revenue and Wisconsin jukebox operations. A mob source is said to have called the police with a tip, stating \\"If you want to find Biernat‚Äôs body, look in the basement of an empty house in an abandoned area in Kenosha County.\\" When pressed for the specifics, the informant said \\"Well, you can be sure of one thing, it (the body) ain‚Äôt going to fly away.‚Äù This led local authorities and the FBI to Bong. Deputy Bob Cantwell spotted a bloody handprint on a board over a cellar entrance of the former Rutledge residence. Two hours of digging with trenching tools would reveal Biernat's body, hands tied together with a white, plastic wire.  Transfer of land  Alternate usage = Several ideas were proposed to salvage the work already completed on Bong. These included an international jet airport, an industrial center, a planned community, a prison, a national cemetery, and use by NASA. = Park land and forest preserve = Nearly of the site were transferred to the Kenosha County park commission and four local school districts. 360 acres in the northeastern corner were handed over to the county parks. Below that, 160 acres were transferred to Salem central High District, and 24 acres were deeded to Brighton Elementary School District No. 1 at the corner of present-day Highways 142 and 75. The very southwestern 120 acres of the base was turned over to the Kenosha Unified School District No. 1 School Forest. The western 320 acres of the base lying in Racine County were deeded to the Burlington Are Join District and Wilmot Union High School, respectively. = School = The $100,000 (nearly $1 million adjusted for inflation as of research in 2017) corrugated Army Engineer's office at the corner of Highway 142 and 75 was bought by the Brighton Joint School District for $1. It opened as Brighton School No. 1 and held classes starting on September 6, 1960, with 124 students in four classrooms. An entirely separate building would later be built to house classrooms along with a gymnasium in 1975. The former air force base structure, know simply as the \\"metal building\\" to residents, would later serve as the school's cafeteria and town hall office until it was demolished in the 2000s during renovations to the main school building. =Golf course= The northeastern portion of the base was turned into Brighton Dale Links, a golf course. Prior to Air Force activity, this 360-acre tract was home to the Evans, Hulett, Dixon Wagner and Rhodes families. The Air Force intended to turn this section into airmen's dorms, dining hall, service club, officer's open mess, Bachelor Officer Quarters and a multi-story 50-bed hospital. Relatively little construction activity occurred in this area prior to the base's cancellation. The course opened on July 1, 1972, as three nine-hole courses: the Red, north and west of the clubhouse, the White, to the south and east, and the Blue, to the south and west. It is presently a 45-hole course. =Bong Corporation= Governor Knowles unveils the sign marking the site of what would become the Bong Memorial Recreation Area The abandoned base was turned over to the General Services Administration (GSA) in 1959. In the same year, the Wisconsin legislature created the Wisconsin Federal Surplus Property Development Commission, later known as the Bong Commission, to find a use for the affected area and guide disposal of the property. Three people were appointed by Governor Gaylord Nelson to the group‚ÄîGeorge Schlitz from nearby Wheatland, Wheatland town chairman and former chairman of the Kenosha County board; William Beyer of Racine, chairman of the Racine County board; and Professor Jacob Beuscher of Madison, from the University of Wisconsin School of Law. That commission subsequently set up a dummy corporation, the Wisconsin federal Surplus Property Development Commission, later known as the Bong Corporation. The Bong Corporation had the sole purpose of aiding the Conservation Department (the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources would not be established until 1966) in converting the remaining of the site into a recreation complex. This was to be accomplished through the issue of bonds. A parcel was purchased from the GSA using money provided by Herro and Associates. In return, Herro and Associates granted a 10-year lease with an option to buy 960 acres at cost and a trust securing the corporation's bonds. Herro and Associates intended to convert the abandoned air base into an industrial park. The same firm had first rights acquiring 1,591 acres of adjacent land to the west for a new urban development making use of the former runway and taxiway. This deal would later put the Bong Corporation in direct conflict with contracts extended to the private interest. The Wisconsin legislature enacted Chapter 646, Laws of 1965, in order to remove the air base property from the jurisdiction of the Bong Commission. This move nullified all contracts signed by the Bong Commission. This also resulted in the 960-acre parcel being transferred to the Conservation Department, setting off litigation between Herro and Associates and the Bong Corporation. The case wound up in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which ruled that contracts entered in to between Herro and the Bong Corporation could not be nullified. In that same ruling, the court pointed out that the state had the power of condemnation, so long as Herro and Associates were justly compensated. The Conservation Department's successor, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, initiated condemnation proceedings in 1973, resulting in monies awarded to Herro and Associates in the Circuit Court of Kenosha County. Herro was to receive $293,000 for the 960-acre parcel, and $15,851 for the rights to the 1,584 parcel. Herro appealed this ruling to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and filed a $1.4 million claim. The court upheld the lower court's decision, and the title for the land was turned over to the Wisconsin DNR. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources went on to acquire 1,971 acres of land intended by the federal government for wildlife conservation. The GSA stipulated in the deed that the parcel would be \\"continuously used only for the conversation of wildlife\\". If the department failed to meet those requirements, the land would be returned to the federal government.  Richard Bong Recreation Area  White Xs mark both ends of the never-completed runway to warn pilots that the 12,500-foot strip is closed. After becoming the hotspot for biker gangs and criminal activity, the state of Wisconsin finally bought the site in 1974. It was then turned into a park, called Richard Bong State Recreation Area. It was the state's first recreation area. A lake was created on the east end of the property by damming an old irrigation ditch that passed under the former Brighton Road on its way to Highway 75. Both of these features are still recognizable under water from the air. The two large holes that went on to create the lake are remnants from the air base construction as workers tried to reach bedrock in order to support a refueling station. The lake was originally called East Lake, and renamed in honor of Vern Wolf after his death in 1994. Vern Wolf was the associate editor of the Burlington Standard Press and was present on the base when the cancellation order came in. He later volunteered thousands of hours of his time to show visitors the \\"wonder of nature.\\" The remains of the asphalt runway are now used for model and remote-control aircraft flights; there are also scheduled events for model rocketry and hang gliding. Geography Bong AFB is located at (42.637394, -88.149114), at an elevation of 810 feet (246 m) above sea level. The air base was to occupy 5,160 acres, or 8.063-square-miles (20.88 km2). The subsequent recreation area has a total area of .

At the time of his death from pancreatic cancer in Manhattan in June 2008, his brother Jeffrey Shernoff told The New York Times that he found it ironic that after years of living with HIV infection, \\"He died of pancreatic cancer, which may not even be related.\\" Professional contributions Shernoff was an early volunteer for Gay Men's Health Crisis and became one of the first social workers in the United States to address AIDS in a private psychotherapy practice. He wrote many articles and offered training for both mental health professionals and patients on dealing with mental health aspects of gay sexuality and living with HIV and AIDS. In 1985 he and Luis Palacios-Jim√©nez created the workshop \\"Hot, Horny and Healthy: Eroticizing Gay Sex\\" for a Gay Men‚Äôs Health Crisis conference. The workshop, intended to teach gay men how to continue to engage in sexual activity without risking HIV transmission, was eventually presented in cities across North America. A pamphlet that he co-authored, When a Friend Has AIDS,When a Friend Has AIDS, by Dixie Beckham, Diego Lopez, Luis Palacios- Jimenez, Vincent Patti and Michael Shernoff (New York: Chelsea Psychotherapy Associates, 1989) was translated into eight languages. Shernoff produced, following the AIDS death of a partner, an anthology entitled Gay Widowers: Life after the Death of a Partner that ten years later was described as still being the only book to address the specific challenges of grief for gay men having lost their partners.

Design and development The marketing name A 210 is usually used to refer to Aquila's light side by side two seat aircraft, though its official engineering and certification name is Aquila AT01. Design work started in 1997 and the first flight was made in March 2000. The A 210 is entirely built from carbon and glass fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP and GFRP). CRFP is used for the more highly stressed members, spars, frames and stringers, GFRP for shells and control surfaces, the latter with GFRP/polyurethane sandwich construction. The low wing has straight tapered inboard sections with increasing sweep outboard and winglets at the tips on production examples. It has a laminar flow section and 4.5¬∞ of dihedral. The ailerons are balanced and the inboard single slotted Fowler flaps have two positions. The A 210 is powered by a Rotax 912 flat four engine driving a two blade propeller. The cabin has uninterrupted transparencies fore and aft, with a slender fuselage behind. The canopy is forward hinged. The tailplane is set just above the fuselage and the fin is swept. A small ventral fin doubles as a tail bumper. The A 210 has a fixed tricycle undercarriage. Its mainwheels are fitted with hydraulic brakes and mounted on spring steel legs from the fuselage. The nosewheel has rubber suspension and is steerable; speed fairings are fitted on all wheels. Operational history right German certification was achieved in 2001 and deliveries began the following year. It gained US certification in 2003.

Albert Elms was born in Newington, Kent, England, and died in Southampton. He joined the Royal Marine Band Service at Deal in 1934, took part in the Vaagso raid in 1940 and served on the Malta Convoys in 1941-42. After Albert left the Royal Marines he joined Francis, Day and Hunter, a music publishing company. His break into television came with the launch of commercial television in Britain during 1955. He made a contribution to ITV's The Adventures of Robin Hood (1955‚Äì59) with Richard Greene in the lead, writing the musical scores for at least two series.

Older history The Fr√∂s√∂ church was built at the end of 12th century or in the beginning of the 13th century. Fr√∂s√∂n is considered by many as the city's cradle, since the island was J√§mtlands centre for centuries. Since the 16th century when Sweden became a sovereign state, its leadership has sought to expand Sweden's influence over J√§mtland, which at the time still was a part of Norway, or more precisely Denmark-Norway. First politically, with no substantial result, later economically. Cities were established along the Norrlandic coast in order to control trade, J√§mtland's faring trade included. H√§rn√∂sand was the first city established in 1585, later followed by Sundsvall 1621. These cities were tiny and had little success dealing with the deeply rooted resistance towards States' interest in controlling trade and the connection between Tr√∏ndelag and J√§mtland.Rumar, Historia kring K√∂len p. 34 Plans regarding the foundation of a Swedish city or k√∂ping (market town, \\"Chipping\\") in J√§mtland existed amongst governmental officials already after the province was ceded from Denmark-Norway in 1645. Queen Christina demanded the establishment of a sconce on Anders√∂n shortly after the province became Swedish, this sconce would together with Fr√∂s√∂ sconce secure the Swedish control over J√§mtland.County Administrative Board of J√§mtland (Swedish) Christina's intention was to locate the \\"Jamts' city\\" within this fortification. In order to construct the sconce the local inhabitants were coerced into forced labour 1651 but after protests and lack of capital the project was ended in 1654. Shortly afterwards there was a major revolt against the Swedish governance of J√§mtland in Storsj√∂bygden and after the Dano-Norwegian reconquest of J√§mtland in 1677 where the Jamts actively aided their \\"real\\" countrymen, saw them as liberators and fought the Swedes, all plans were regarding a Swedish city in J√§mtland were put on ice. In 1758 the plans were brought back up through an initiative from a civilian, though the authority saw no need for a city in J√§mtland. The proposition did, however, initiate a new debate whether or not a city was to be established in J√§mtland. The already mentioned Norrlandic cities demanded it so that the faring traditions and the lucrative cross country border trade conducted by Jamts in Norway across K√∂len was ended. The Jamts were known to neglect the agriculture and instead take on long trading journeys all over Scandinavia to various markets. With a city in J√§mtland this could finally end and the city would be able to secure the goods transportation, which usually was very scarce, to the coast. From a military point a foundation of a city in J√§mtland was favorable, given that Sweden no longer was power to be reckon with in Northern Europe. Foundation of √ñstersund Kyrkparken next to Gamla Kyrkan \\"the old church\\" in central √ñstersund, this church was the first church in √ñstersund. When the houses were smaller it dominated the cityscape. √ñstersund was founded and given its charter by King Gustav III of Sweden in 1786, shortly after the outskirt of the Odensala farmers' lands were bought for the purpose. The only thing actually located in the area at the time was the main road and the bridge to Fr√∂s√∂n, the then mercantile and administrative centre of J√§mtland. The trade in J√§mtland couldn't be prevented from the Norrlandic coast, all trade restrictions such as border controls, punishments, trade prohibition and tariffs were unsatisfying for the Swedish authority. The Jamts were too cunning and some people claim that the Jamtish signature mark b√§llt du luur'n (were you able to trick him) derives from the Jamtish attempts to trick the Swedish border guard in order to avoid paying customs on merchandises brought back from Norway. This development wasn't unique for Sweden, it occurred throughout the Nordic countries, in today's Finland the cities Tampere, Kuopio and Kaskinen were founded. Though √ñstersund is, as stated in the beginning, the only city in today's Sweden founded and chartered in the 18th century. In Denmark-Norway Reykjav√≠k was founded the very same year as √ñstersund on Iceland. √ñstersund was upon foundation freed from taxes during a 20 years timespan and completely liberated from trade regulations and guild order. The State tried to pursue the Jamtish traders on Fr√∂s√∂n to migrate to the new city but they had no intentions of leaving such a rich parish with fertile soils Fr√∂s√∂n consisted of in favor of the swamp and marches across the strait. During its first 50 years the city's population only grew (on average) with eight people per year. The city did become the capital of the newly founded county consisting of the provinces J√§mtland and H√§rjedalen in 1810, meaning that a county residence was built and a county administrative board was located to the city. Though √ñstersund remained as a de facto farmer village with less than 400 inhabitants 1820. The 1840s were slightly better when Jemtlands Tidning (J√§mtland's first newspaper) was established, the first church was inaugurated, Fr√∂s√∂ Trivial School was located to the city and a general hospital was built. The city grew a little more when the full scale logging process was initiated in the 1850s and the 1860s. The city of Good Templars It took till the construction of the railroad in 1879 before √ñstersund became a real city and actually gained the status as J√§mtland's centre, at Fr√∂s√∂n's expense. Thanks to the \\"farmer chieftain\\" Nils Larson i Tullus the railroad came to pass through the city itself instead of outside it, as planned. The railway from coast to coast across the then union between Sweden and Norway was finished 1882, connecting √ñstersund closer to Trondheim and Sundsvall. √ñstersund then came to grow faster than any other Swedish city. After ten years it had passed 20 Swedish cities in population. The city attracted immigrants, a majority from the Jamtish countryside though still with a high number of settlers from Southern Sweden. Without the railroad from coast to coast √ñstersund probably wouldn't have been much of a city today. This railway station was built in 1879. Along with the settlers came new influences to J√§mtland and the province entered the popular movement age forcefully. In comparison with the rest of Sweden the popular movements in √ñstersund were unusually dynamical. In J√§mtland and H√§rjedalen the free minded Good Templar movement (a part of the temperance movement) came to dominate completely. It was preceded by the free church movement that challenged the city's establishment with the creation of a missionary house and a baptist chapel. The third large popular movement, the labour movement was greatly hampered by the free minded temperance movement but also become somewhat prominent in the city, given that first of May demonstrations were held as early as 1890. The first temperance lounge in √ñstersund was established in 1882, after half a year the numbers of lounges had grown to six. In 1883, 700 of the city's total population of 3,000 were organized Good Templars. The rapid success the movement had created a unique enthusiasm and the movement came to encompass every part of the society. The movement arranged its own weddings, Christmas markets, entertainment establishments and coffeehouses were started, banks, a social insurance agency, library were founded by the movement. Though the greatest symbol of the movements grandeur was the Order House constructed 1885 in the city, √ñstersunds-Goodtemplars-Ordenshus. When one of the most prominent leaders, Joseph Malins, visited the city he announced that it was the world's largest order house. √ñstersund was the Good Templar city. The year afterwards, when the city celebrated its 100th anniversary the Good Templar and newspaper proprietor Johan Lindstr√∂m Saxon looked forward and prophesied the fast- growing city as the new capital in Sweden-Norway till the city's 200th anniversary (√ñstersund did not achieve this status, as the union was abolished in 1905). J√§mtland with √ñstersund as its centre became the temperance movements, in relation to the population, strongest foothold in the entire World. At the same time √ñstersund became the trading centre of J√§mtland with the ancient market Gregorie market as highlight. Sweden received its freedom of trade in 1864 and the city's trade exploded and grew sevenfold from the early 1870s till 1910. In 1886, 30 per cent of the population in √ñstersund were tradesmen (twice as high as the national average), remarkably, 45 per cent of the tradesmen at the time were females. Ironically it wasn't until the establishment of the railroad and with the liberalization of trade the city actually fulfilled its purpose and the faring traditions in J√§mtland ended. A Jamtish house behind a traditional split-rail fence at Jamtli History Land in √ñstersund Jamtli was a result of the native district movement. √ñstersund was a city in symbiosis with the countryside surrounding it, both economically and culturally and the extremely unusual \\"native district movement\\" broke ground in the beginning of the 20th century. In 1908 the organization J√§mtsl√∂jd was founded joining the ancient monument association and together they started planning an open-air museum ‚Äì Jamtli. The museum was later followed by a county museum and the Regional Archive. An important element in the culture was J√§mtland's library, which was moved from Fr√∂s√∂n to √ñstersund in 1912. √ñstersund thus came to inhabit one of the most valuable libraries in northern Scandinavia. The time preceding World War I was a very important time for √ñstersund due to the fact that most of what's characterized √ñstersund as a city was established then. The idealistic views among the population had expressed itself through the popular movements, and continued to do so. \\"If it had come to moving √Öreskutan rock by rock we'd have deemed it possible\\" an older Good Templar later said. When the population constantly grew new constructions were made. It was now that the great city hall was built 1912 after the drawings of Frans Bertil Wallberg. Among the Good Templars local history become extremely popular and the temperance movement and the native district movement were joint. The Good Templars saw industrialization as a significant threat towards the native districts and the old village and farmer community. Due to most of √ñstersund's population having their roots in the Jamtish countryside the city was spared from city-village tensions. The work from the movements made the city and its centre-right (Swedish: borgerlig, see burgh and bourgeoisie) governance extremely rejective towards industries. Instead they wanted to portray √ñstersund as a centre of outdoor activities, culture, education and tourism. Industries were not allowed to threaten the good environment, the fresh air, the nature and the social history traditions. War and crisis √ñstersund's city map of 1922 However, everything wasn't positive in the city. Signs of harsher times were evident. The labour market conflict of 1909 (the Swedish General Strike) was the culmination of growing tension between workers and employers. No larger encounters occurred though the strike was a huge setback for the labour movement in Sweden and even more so in √ñstersund. In 1917 when the Great War was fought on the continent and with the February revolution in Russia, starting the Russian Revolution also affected √ñstersund. Rationing led to lack of supplies and a revolution was feared. Some of the citizens, primarily soldiers, went on hunger strikes and at the first of May that year 4,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the city hall demanding lower prices on milk and wood. The year after the Spanish flu spread like wildfire across the world. The city doctor in √ñstersund notified that \\"√ñstersund ought without objection have been more haunted by the flu than any other Swedish city\\", which is why √ñstersund has been referred to as the \\"Spanish flu's capital\\". The old school (today the tourist agency) became a temporary hospital and when no crisis centre existed several organizations stepped in to help the population. Even the authority did what they could and banned public gatherings, in addition to the closing of theaters and cinemas. Interwar period One of √ñstersund's city buses outside of the shopping mall Mittpunkten. Despite the great depression and several crisis resulting in a very high unemployment rate √ñstersund continued to grow in the interwar period. The municipal community Odenslund was incorporated into √ñstersund in 1918. The business world remained largely unaffected and √ñstersund continued being one of the least industrialized cities in Sweden. Instead √ñstersund continued to focus on wholesale trade and became a centre of this in northern and north central Sweden. The city's central position was strengthened when Inlandsbanan was constructed through J√§mtland from the north to the south. During the interwar period the car and the bus became common. The first scheduled bus route was created in the 1920s between √ñstersund and the nearby town of Brunflo. In the next decade well over 40 bus routes were functioning in √ñstersund. The buses were of the skvader- type, a cross between a bus and a truck carrying both people and milk bottles. The dairy was located west of the bus square, Gustav III:s torg, at the shopping mall K√§rnan's current whereabout. This square naturally become a central part of the city. The social life changed, √ñstersunds Rundradiostation started its radio broadcast in 1927 and the cinemas became an obvious entertainment. The sport received its first large facilities. In 1917 Hofvallen was inaugurated and in the 1930s a bath house, a harness racing course and the tennis hall were built. The Good Templar movement won the Swedish prohibition referendum of 1922 by a landslide in J√§mtland County, 72.2 per cent of the population supported a prohibition (63.5 per cent of the males and 83.2 per cent of the females). No prohibition was introduced though when Sweden as a whole voted against a prohibition. Despite the massive amount of support regionally the movement began declining. The movement did, however, affect the city largely. It was like the dawn of a new age when the Good Templar house's sign was changed in 1947 into \\"teater\\" (theater) in what's now Gamla Teatern \\"the old theater\\". The large brick church was built in front of √ñster√§ngsparken 1940, during World War II. Post War period √ñstersund continued to grow after World War II. Lugnvik was incorporated into the city in 1954 and √ñstersund was just like the rest of J√§mtland affected by the Rehn- Meidner-model, though not in the same way. The Swedish Keynesian politic was launched in order to improve the mobility of the labour force. J√§mtland was struck hard by this when the people moved from the countryside to cities, from inland to coast and from the north to the south. As an urban area √ñstersund was affected by the Million Programme and urban districts like K√∂rf√§ltet were created. flag can be seen throughout the year at the main town square. The negative view towards industries were changed when the Social Democrats came to power for the first time in the city's history in 1952. Industries were enticed to √ñstersund through the national localization politic and industrial areas were created in Odenskog and Lugnvik. The development wasn't, as already mentioned, as good in the rest of J√§mtland as it was in √ñstersund and as a counter act towards the governmental politic the Republic of Jamtland was established in 1963. √ñstersund became the republic's \\"capital\\" and the home to the freedom festival Storsj√∂yran. √ñstersund continued to grow and in 1970 Fr√∂s√∂ k√∂ping was made a part of √ñstersund. In the year of 1971 a major reform occurred in Sweden creating large municipalities replacing all the older institutions and the new large municipality was named after the city. Just like in the rest of Sweden the public sector greatly expanded at this time. In 1960 the public sector of Sweden constituted about 30 per cent of Sweden's total gross domestic product, in the middle of the 1980s the number had grown to 65 per cent. At the time it was here the jobs were, in the county board, the state and in the new municipality. The main reason for the large expansion were the expanded transfer payment to the households that occurred, along with growing interest and public consummation. Everything was founded by large tax raises. The entire 1970s was an expansion period. Besides the new industrial complex the Fr√∂s√∂ bridge was constructed, a new police house, Z-kupolen (burned to the ground in 1989), Storsj√∂teatern, Folkets hus, urban district churches, shopping malls etc. The County Administration board and the hospital expanded and large housing estates were constructed in K√∂rf√§ltet, Lugnvik and Odensala. The city tried to acquire a \\"humanistic college of higher learning\\" on Fr√∂s√∂n already in the 1940s. A large tension existed between the cities in Norrland and Ume√• left the struggle victorious 1962. √ñstersund, however, required a \\"social college of higher learning\\" in 1971. 21st century Since 2005, √ñstersund has been one of the main campus sites of the Mid Sweden University (Mittuniversitetet). A number of governmental offices have also been located to the city in recent years. An asylum centre has now opened near √ñstersund.

It was a fast-paced, ever-changing volley of acts that included award-winning jugglers, fire-eaters, stand-up comics, singers, musicians, and sketch comedy troupes. History In February 1992, producers Thom Goodman (co-founder with J.P. Mayer, CrossCurrents Cabaret Theater, 1978) and R. O‚ÄôDonnell (founder, New Age Vaudeville) teamed up to present the New Variety, located at 400 N. Clark, downtown Chicago. Modeled after the vaudeville variety shows of the ‚Äò20s and '30s, the New Variety presented an evening‚Äôs worth of acts that included jugglers, fire-eaters, comics, singers, musicians, and sketch comedy troupes. =Venues= New Variety Cabaret The original location of the New Variety was the upstairs of the Italian restaurant Bellagio. Built specifically for the show, the cabaret was an elegant and intimate 100-seat theater, revealing a sophisticated art deco-style decor. The audience sat at round black tables with green and black chairs around a small black-and-white checkered stage, slightly raised. Hailed by the Chicago Tribune as a Cabaret for the 90s. the bill included artistic director & host Richard O'Donnell (billed as \\"R.\\"), jazz band the Vince Willis Trio, juggler extraordinaire Andy Head, drummer Donny DeMarco Jr., tap dancer Ayrie King, stand-up comedy by John Tamborino, and Saxophonist Sarah Underwood, followed by a crowning performance by the incomparable blues chanteuse Barbara LeShoure. Improv Comedy Club In August, 1993, the New Variety moved to the Chicago Improv, (504 N. Wells) and was responsible for changing a faltering 3-ring comedy presentation into a successful variety format. The New Variety now offered a more streamlined, commercial show. Acts included artistic director & host R. O‚ÄôDonnell, stand-up comics such as Paul Gilmartin (Dinner and a movie, host), Kevin Rogers, and Steve Seagren and sketch comedy troupes including the all-girl Nude Coffee, the all-gay The Boys in the Bathroom, and the all-improv The Upright Citizens Brigade. Dr. Boom (who literally blew things up on stage) was the highlight of the evening. The Chicago Improv was a 400-seat theater whereby audience members sat at long tables in a room about the size of your high school cafeteria. Scott Seigel re-designed the original look of the stage to accommodate the New Variety's edgier feel.

In 1916 a Board of Engineers was appointed to report on a water augmentation scheme for the city. Their proposal was the Steenbras scheme which would consist of a concrete gravity and arch dam on the Steenbras River. This dam would be connected to the Molteno reservoir through a tunnel in the Hottentots Holland mountains and a 64 kilometre long cast iron pipeline. Work began on the scheme in 1918 and was completed three years later. The Steenbras scheme could supply Cape Town with up to 42 million litres of water per day although the average consumption was in the region of 29 million litres per day. The consumption however grew rapidly and it was not long before Cape Town once again had a water supply problem. To solve the demand for additional water supplies the Steenbras dam wall was raised and an additional pipeline was laid into the city. This work was completed in 1928. For much of the first half of the twentieth century it was the main reservoir for Cape Town but is now only one of many dams that supply the city. The hazard potential of Steenbras has been ranked high (3). There is a hydroelectric plant at the dam. The Steenbras pumped-storage scheme was opened in 1979 to supplement Cape Town's electricity supply during periods of peak demand. The dam is on the Steenbras River, which, in common with most rivers in the Western Cape, has a low sediment load and delivers water of very high quality. The river and dam are named after the steenbras, a fish endemic to South Africa. Steenbras Upper Dam is directly upstream and is used for the Steenbras Power Station (pumped storage). The City of Cape Town is investigating strengthening and raising the wall to increase Steenbras Dam's capacity.

In 2015 Turpentine Creek reached Verified Status from the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries. Turpentine Creek is a member of American Association of Zoo Keepers.  Expansion  In 2012 Turpentine Creek rescued 34 big cats from a breeding facility. To accommodate this massive number of cats a secondary area was built, which is now referred to as \\"Rescue Ridge\\". Many of the cats rescued from the facility were not used to human contact. To reduce stress to the animals this area is not open to the public. Turpentine Creek has spent the past few years working to expand the refuge. The original area, now referred to as the \\"Compound\\" that contained smaller cages with cement flooring has been emptied. Turpentine has built spacious, grassy habitats ranging in size from 1/4 acre to 1/2 acre for the animals to live in over the past 14 years. As of Sept. 16th 2015, all of the small concrete cages that used to make up the majority of Turpentine Creek have been emptied. Sept. 17th 2015, demolition of the old \\"compound\\" area began.

She was transferred to the Ministry of War Transport in 1944 and renamed Empire Crossbow. Later that year, she was requisitioned by the Royal Navy and commissioned as HMS Sainfoin, with the pennant number F183. In 1946, she was returned to merchant service as Empire Crossbow. She was transferred to the United States in 1947 and renamed Cape Washington. The ship was then laid up until scrapped in 1964. Description The ship was built in 1944 by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Wilmington, California. She was Yard Number 357. The ship was long between perpendiculars, overall, with a beam of . She had a depth of . She was assessed at , . Her DWT was 6,440. The ship was propelled by two steam turbines of 12,000 nhp total. They were double reduction geared, driving a single screw propeller. They could propel her at a maximum speed of , with being the normal service speed. The turbines were built by Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co, Essington, Pennsylvania. History Built as the merchant vessel Cape Washington, the ship was launched on 30 November 1943, and completed on 31 January 1944 as the landing ship Empire Crossbow. She was transferred to the British Ministry of War Transport under the Lend-Lease scheme. The Official Number 168908 and Code Letters MYMV were allocated. Her port of registry was London. (Enter MYMV or Empire Crossbow in relevant search box) Empire Crossbow departed from Wilmington on her maiden voyage on 7 February 1944. She sailed via the Panama Canal to Bermuda, sustaining some damage in storms in the Caribbean. At Bermuda, it was estimated that repairs would take 14 days to complete. Empire Crossbow joined a convoy and departed Bermuda on 24 February, the day she had arrived there. She arrived at Greenock, Renfrewshire on 6 March. Empire Crossbow departed the Clyde on 26 March and sailed via Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire and Weymouth Bay, Dorset to the Cowes Roads, of the Isle of Wight, arriving on 30 March. During Operation Overlord (the D-Day landings), Empire Crossbow, under the command of Captain Alexander Rodger, carried A and B Company, Hampshire Regiment, with C and D company on . They were landed on Gold Beach. The Hampshires achieved their objective to capture Le Hamel and Arromanches, Lower Normandy. Empire Crossbow lost three LCAs during the landings. She then returned to Southampton, sailing on 7 June as a member of Convoy EWP 1, which arrived at the Seine Bay on 8 June. On 29 June Empire Crossbow embarked aircrew from 507th Fighter Squadron at Southampton, Hampshire and landed them at Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, Lower Normandy. In September, Empire Crossbow embarked troops from the 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry at Arromanches and took them to Southampton, from where they were to go to Bulford Camp, on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire. Empire Crossbow was transferred to the Royal Navy and commissioned as HMS Sainfoin in November 1944. She was named after the racehorse Sainfoin, the winner of the 1890 Derby. Her armament consisted 1 √ó gun, 1 √ó 12-pounder (3-inch (76.2 mm)) gun, 12 √ó anti-aircraft guns, 2 √ó guns. She also carried 18 LCAs and could accommodate 1,500 troops. HMS Sainfoin sailed to Greenock to embark Royal Marines from 553 flotilla. She then sailed to Bombay, India, where she received orders to sail to Karachi, India. Sainfoin participated in troop landing exercises in preparation for Operation Zipper. She landed troops in Rangoon, Burma, in June 1945. She proceeded to Penang, Port Dixon, and Port Swettenham, Malaya; the Port Swettenham landings took place on 9 September. She proceeded to Medan, Indonesia, and Singapore. On 3 October, Sainfoin anchored at Emmahaven, Indonesia, where the Commanders- in-Chief of the Japanese forces in Sumatra signed the surrender document on . On 16 October 1945, during Sainfoins voyage back to the United Kingdom, Sainfoin received a distress call from the hospital ship , which was carrying 820 repatriated prisoners of war from Hong Kong to Madras, India. It took Sainfoin four hours to reach Takliwa, which had run aground at Indira Point, Great Nicobar, and caught fire. Using her LCAs, Sainfoin rescued all 1,083 people on board Takliwa, as well as the ship's cat. During the rescue, three of Sainfoins LCAs were lost. Sainfoins mascot, a baboon named Mortimer, took a liking to the cat. On arrival at Bombay, the cat promptly went ashore. Mortimer's intended fate was to be given to a zoo in the United Kingdom, but he grew too big and dangerous so he was euthanased before Sainfoin reached the United Kingdom. Post-war, Sainfoin assisted in mopping up operations in the Dutch East Indies. On one occasion, a pregnant woman went into labour whilst men from Sainfoin were assisting in one such operation. She was transferred to the ship for medical attention. A healthy baby boy was born on board. He was given the name Sainfoin. Sainfoin was at Singapore when the news came through that she was to be paid off. She sailed the following day, her destination was Greenock. A number of her crew volunteered for service on the voyage to return the ship to the United States, but their request was denied. HMS Sainfoin was returned to merchant service, with the name reverting to Empire Crossbow in September 1946. She was returned to the United States in September 1946 and re-entered merchant service under her original name, Cape Washington, the following year. She was laid up in the James River until 1964, when she was sold on 1 December for $47,206 to Peck Iron & Metal Co for dismantling. Cape Washington was scrapped at Portsmouth, Virginia.

History In 1846 there was a post office, run by a postmistress, Mrs Walters, and six farms in the area. 43 years later the first steam train stopped there in 1890. The railway station later became the Post Office. The waiting room was also used for English Church Services in 1925, as there was no church building at the time. Wild flowers grew in profusion on the mountains and hills around the village and selling them was a major source of income for the villagers in the early 1900s. Today the little village is flanked by up-market residential estates and various wine farms, including Goederverwachting Farm, where it is reported that the Articles of Capitulation for the Battle of Blaauwberg were signed by General Janssens, the Batavian Governor of the Cape.

Early career Rogers was born at Muswell Hill, one of three sons of Reginald Scott Rogers and Marjorie Rogers n√©e Prince. A fair-haired right-handed middle-order batsman who sometimes opened the innings, Stuart Rogers was educated at Highgate School from 1935 to 1941, playing in the cricket XI for four years and also captaining the soccer XI. He went on to Pembroke College, Cambridge before enlisting in 1943, serving in the 6th Gurkhas and the Chindits during the Second World War and eventually becoming a Major. He played in the wartime university matches against Oxford University at both soccer and cricket in 1941-1942. After one first-class appearance in India in 1946-47, he joined Somerset as an amateur player in 1948, appearing in seven matches but making little impact. The following year, Rogers played 13 times, appearing in two periods of the season. In June, he made his first three 50s, with 54 against the New Zealanders, 51 against Gloucestershire and 61 against Hampshire in successive matches. He was less successful in August, when the efforts of other amateurs helped Somerset to overcome the handicap of losing 15 out of 26 County Championship matches, as many as any other county side, and finish joint ninth out of 17. At the end of the 1949 season, George Woodhouse, the Somerset captain, retired to the family brewery business. Somerset, who had struggled through 1948 under a series of temporary captains, were not keen to repeat the experience. Rogers was the only available amateur willing to commit to a full season, and was duly appointed captain for 1950. Somerset captain Rogers captained Somerset for three seasons of mixed fortunes. The 1950 season saw the side finish equal seventh in the Championship, and eight victories were exceeded by only three teams. \\"Once more volatile Somerset falsified prophecies of a poor season,\\" wrote Wisden in its review. It went on: \\"The appointment of an inexperienced player to lead a side forced to make experiments seemed like a leap in the dark, but as the summer advanced deeds spoke louder than words and in the end an adventurous policy was fully justified.\\" Rogers' own contribution was 1030 Championship runs, 1127 in all matches, including his first century, 101, batting at No 7 against Northamptonshire at Frome. In this innings, he hit three sixes and nine fours, and shared a seventh wicket partnership of 182 with Harold Stephenson; Rogers and Stephenson were responsible for several late-innings fast-scoring partnerships in Somerset matches in 1950.For other examples see Rogers' second season as Somerset captain, 1951, was more difficult than the first. The side was dependent for wickets on a trio of spin bowlers, Johnny Lawrence, Ellis Robinson and Horace Hazell, with the last two both past 40. In 1950, runs had come from several team members: in 1951, Maurice Tremlett made more than 2,000 and Harold Gimblett 1,400, but no one else apart from a couple of irregular amateurs averaged more than 20. Rogers made only 784 runs in Championship games with a top score of 58, although his season average and total was improved by an unbeaten 107 in 160 minutes against the South African touring team. This was to prove his highest score in first-class cricket. With both batting and bowling inadequacies, Somerset fell back to 14th in the Championship, with only five victories and 15 defeats. Worse followed in 1952. Gimblett made 2,000 runs, and the rest of the batting was marginally improved over 1951, but inability to take wickets at reasonable cost consigned the side to the bottom of the Championship table for the first time since 1913. Only two matches were won all season and, Wisden reported, \\"even these meagre successes were due as much to the spin of the coin as the turn of the ball. When Somerset won the toss in the Bath Festival they triumphed over Middlesex and Warwickshire and when they lost it they went under to Leicestershire.\\" Wisden noted too that morale was low: \\"General slackness, particularly in fielding, was Somerset's biggest handicap. Until the whole club develops a more enthusiastic spirit as portrayed by Gimblett, they will continue to disappoint their faithful supporters.\\" Rogers himself had a mediocre season: he made 841 runs in the Championship, with a third and final career century, an unbeaten 102 in Gimblett's benefit match against Northamptonshire at Glastonbury. At the end of the season he stood down from the captaincy, and though he appeared again in nine matches in 1953, he was not successful and left first-class cricket. Personal style Rogers was captain in 89 of the 119 first-class matches he appeared in. His instincts appear to have been largely attacking, and he had a limited and ageing side at his disposal. David Foot, the historian of Somerset cricket, wrote: \\"The crowd quite liked him, though he wasn't wholly one of the boys.\\" Foot records the senior professional, Horace Hazell, being taken out for drinks at restaurants by Rogers and returning \\"as drunk as a handcart\\". But Eric Hill, one of the young players of the time and later the doyen of the Taunton press box, \\"feels that Rogers probably lacked rapport with the younger professionals\\". Hill records, in Foot's book, Rogers ordering a curfew of 10 o'clock in a match against Hampshire: \\"The skipper plotted his evening accordingly and staggered up to bed at half-past nine... more drunk than anyone I've ever seen in my life.\\" As was sometimes the custom of the 1950s, Rogers was nominally the secretary as well as the captain of Somerset, though the secretarial duties appear to have been undertaken by a succession of retired military gentlemen. The arrangement would have allowed Rogers to draw a salary while maintaining his amateur status. Later life and death Rogers became a member of the London Stock Exchange and a partner in Keith, Bayley & Rigg, stockbrokers. In 1951 he married Margaret Helen Findlay, who died in 2001. They had a daughter and two sons. He later turned to farming. He died at Chartridge, Buckinghamshire in 1969.

It is in size. The park has a wide frontage to the B√©nou√© River, which stretches for over , forming the eastern boundary. The public road to Tchollir√© cuts across the northern part of the park. The western boundary is made up of the main road linking the towns of Garoua to the north, with Ngaound√©r√© to the south. The park can be accessed coming north from Ngaound√©r√©. History In 1932, the area was established as a Faunal Reserve. It was upgraded to a National Park in 1968, and in 1981, it became a Biosphere Reserve. Geography The National Park is located in the northeastern part of Cameroon in the B√©nou√© Department. It lies in the B√©nou√© savanna belt, a humid savannah woodland area between the cities of Garoua in the north and Ngaound√©r√© to the south. The main river is the B√©nou√© River, which stretches for over , forming the eastern boundary. The park's altitude ranges from above sea level. The higher elevations are characterized by large rocky massifs, while the undulating plain and forest characterizes the lower sections. Eight hunting reserves, totaling , surround the park except along the main road. Flora and fauna Hippopotamus inside the park The habitat in B√©nou√© National Park is characterized by wooded grassland. It includes several types of Sudanian woodland such as Isoberlinia-dominated and other woodland in the south-centre, to shorter, more open, mixed wooded grassland in the north, dry Anogeissus forest, semi-evergreen riparian forest and thickets along the B√©nou√© and its major affluents. African elephant, spotted hyena, waterbuck, warthog and monkeys are also found in the park. The predominant large ungulates in the park are antelope such as the kob, western hartebeest, giant eland and waterbuck, as well as African buffalo. The only place in Africa where there is a realistic change to view the giant eland, Africa's largest antelope, is within B√©nou√© National Park. The African wild dog is present within the national park, though less common here than in Faro National Park. B√©nou√© National Park is known for its hippopotamus colonies. Along with hippo, crocodile are common in the rivers. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit. In 2011, the lion population was estimated at 200 adult individuals. B√©nou√© National Park is an Important Bird Area (#CM007) with recent surveys identifying 306 species. In the dry season, sandbars exposed by fluctuating levels of the sandy B√©nou√© River provide habitat for plover and other waterbirds. Common species include Adamawa turtle-dove, crocodile bird, red-throated bee-eater, red-winged grey warbler, stone partridge, and violet turaco. Population B√©nou√© view Benoue huts Houses within B√©nou√© National Park The majority of the population within the park is nomadic. There is a loose social structure that park guards and conservationists deal with, taking on roles such as community educators and arbitrators. At least one incident of kleptoparasitism, stealing meat from a lion kill, was documented at B√©nou√© National Park.

History The park was never logged; according to the World Wildlife Fund's scientific advisor in the region, Paul Robinson Ngnegueu, \\"poaching is the biggest threat to Boumba Bek.\\" This is a result of the late 1980s economic depression in Cameroon. The indigenous people followed the poachers, attracted by the financial opportunities. They would sell their product through \\"intermediaries\\" for money and more hunting supplies. In 1995, the park was named an Essential Protection Zone, its first official status. It was not formally established as a national park, however, until the Cameroonian government decreed the creation of Boumba Bek and Nki National Parks on 17 October 2005. Its establishment is a result of a summit held by seven central African leaders in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, in February 2005. Cameroon and Gabon are currently working on the TRIDOM project, a conservation initiative leading to a land management plan which will oversee access to and use of forests. It will create a tri-national \\"interzone\\" bordered by the Minkebe, Boumba-Bek, Nki, and Odzala National Parks and the Dja Wildlife Reserve. This project is part of a conservation movement toward the zoning and designation of new protected areas. Geography and climate Boumba Bek is located between the Boumba and Bek Rivers in southeast Cameroon, from which it derives its name. The site is accessible only by pirogue and several hunting trails. It is sandwiched between the towns of Yokadouma and Moloundou in the Boumba et Ngoko department in Cameroon's East Province. The park is situated from latitude 2Àö09 to 2Àö20 N and longitude 15Àö35 to 15Àö50 E. Sixteen bais, or forest clearings, have been discovered in Boumba Bek National Park. Of these, four are currently being monitored for large mammalian activities. The park has a tropical climate with temperature ranging from 23.1 to 25ÀöC with an average annual temperature of 24ÀöC. Its relative humidity varies between 60 and 90% while annual rainfall is 1500 mm per year. According to the Cameroon Ministry of Agriculture, Moloundou has a rainy season from September to November, a dry season from November to March, a rainy season from March to June, and a dry season from July to August. Demographics The area around the park, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund, has a population of 33,169 people, mostly comprising ethnic Bantus and, despite being named a minority in Cameroon's constitution of 18 January 1996, Baka Pygmies. These include the Kounabembe, Bangando, Bakwele, Mbomam, Essel, Mbimo, and Mpong- Mpong tribes. Non-indigenous employees of logging companies and Muslim merchants from northern Cameroon make up a sizeable amount of the total population. BiodiversityFlora= A majority of the park is semi- evergreen lowland rainforest, along with several patches of closed-canopy evergreen forest. Small areas of seasonally flooded forest, swamp-forest, and grassy savannas ealsoxist within its boundaries. =Fauna= Boumba Bek, according to the Environmental News Service, \\"encompass[es] a biodiverse group of plants and animals.\\" Chimpanzees, forest antelope, crocodiles and bongos are all found in Boumba Bek National Park. In addition, roughly 300 fish species, three of which are not named, swim in the park's rivers. The forests of Cameroon contain some of the highest population density of African forest elephants of any nation, and Boumba Bek is no different, with an elephant density of roughly 2.5 for Boumba Bek and Nki combined. Boumba Bek was designated an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International.

The closest towns to Nki are Yokadouma, Moloundou and Lomie, beyond which are rural lands. Due to its remoteness, Nki has been described as \\"the last true wilderness.\\" It has a large and varied ecosystem, and it is home to over 265 species of birds, and the forests of Cameroon contain some of the highest population density of forest elephants of any nation with an elephant density of roughly 2.5 per square kilometer for Nki and neighboring Boumba Bek National Park combined. These animals are victims of poaching, which has been a major problem since an economic depression in the 1980s. The indigenous people follow in the footsteps of the poachers, attracted by the financial opportunities. The removal of logging industries from the park, on the other hand, has been a success; it is no longer considered a major threat to Nki's wilderness. History The World Wildlife Fund has been in the process of conserving the park since the 1980s, including ridding the area of the logging business. This movement, however, has been met with some criticism, especially by members of the remote village of Ndongo, Cameroon. Before WWF arrived, Ndongo was a bustling logging town of 300 residents with fairly good roads and plentiful working opportunities. Once the organization established itself, it pressured the logging companies to operate in a more environmentally friendly manner. The logging companies pulled out of the town in 1988, leaving broken machinery and severely damaging Ndongo's economy. According to Leonard Usongo, manager of WWF projects in southeast Cameroon, \\"we cannot convince a community of the need to protect forests if we don‚Äôt acknowledge their problems or their poverty.\\" Today, logging is no longer a major problem, as \\"it would require a lot of investment to develop necessary infrastructure, such as roads, for [its] operations, especially in the southern portion of Nki.\\" According to the WWF's scientific advisor in the region, Paul Robinson Ngnegueu, \\"poaching is the biggest threat to ... Nki.\\" It is a result of the late 1980s economic depression in Cameroon. The indigenous people followed the poachers, attracted by the financial opportunities. They would sell their product through \\"intermediaries\\" for money and more hunting supplies. Cameroonian authorities fought poaching in Nki by applying repressive measures to the indigenous population. An example of this was in January 1997, when Bakas were forced from their homes near Mambele. These actions turned the Bakas against the WWF, which they considered \\"an organization of whites who want to protect animals\\". Every year, poachers travel up the Dja for central Nki, where elephant ivory is abundant. Strong currents on the river are a deterrent for half the year, but after that, according to freelance journalist Jemini Pandya, the fauna is easy to prey upon. Nonetheless, when Pandya of the WWF visited Nki National Park in the early 1990s, she described it as \\"the last true wilderness.\\" In 1995, the park was named an Essential Protection Zone, its first official status. It was not formally established as a national park until the Cameroonian government decreed the creation of Boumba Bek and Nki National Parks on 17 October 2005. This establishment was not without opposition; the Bakas have continually asked to reduce the park's boundaries and ask for higher usage rights, which invaded upon \\"their\\" land. Cameroon and Gabon are currently working on the TRIDOM project, a conservation initiative leading to a land management plan which will oversee access to and use of forests. It will create a tri-national \\"interzone\\" bordered by the Minkebe, Boumba-Bek, Nki, and Odzala National Parks and the Dja Wildlife Reserve. This project is part of a conservation movement toward the zoning and designation of new protected areas. Geography and climate The park is located in a remote area of southeastern Cameroon, which \\"has helped maintain most of its pristine forest and beauty.\\" It has never been completely explored. Largely hilly in its terrain at an elevation of 350-650 m, it falls within the Sangha ecoregion. Nki is crossed by several large rivers, including the Dja River. A waterfall, Nki falls, is located on the river in the park, giving \\"a tinge of exoticism to the landscape.\\" The park is situated from latitude 2Àö05 to 2Àö50 N and longitude 14Àö05 to 14Àö50 E. It covers a surface area of and straddles two administrative divisions in the East province: Ngoyla in Haut Nyon and Moloundou in Boumba et Ngoko Division. The closest towns to Nki are Yokadouma, Moloundou and Lomie, beyond which is rural lands. Seventy-three bais, or forest clearings, have been discovered in Nki National Park. In April 2006, while looking for elephant groups, a WWF team discovered the largest bai in the region, Ikwa Bai. Dr. Mike Loomis, a member of the group, confirmed that this bai is slightly larger than Dzanga Sangha Bai (Central African Republic), which had previously held the record. He also reported little human development adjacent to the bai, and noticed 21 elephants and 16 buffaloes in it simultaneously. The bai has a small creek running through its center, which sits atop a bed of rocks and sand. A large mineral pit is located next to the stream. It is the habitat of several wildlife species, the largest-numbering being chimpanzees, elephants, buffaloes, and gorillas. The park has a tropical climate with temperature ranging from 23.1-25ÀöC with an average annual temperature of 24ÀöC. Its relative humidity varies between 60 and 90% while annual rainfall is 1500 mm per year. According to the Cameroon Ministry of Agriculture, nearby Moloundou has a rainy season from September to November, a dry season from November to March, a rainy season from March to June, and a dry season from July to August. Demographics The area around the park, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund, has a human population of 22,882, mostly ethnic Bantus and, despite being named a minority in Cameroon's constitution of 18 January 1996, Baka Pygmies. These include the Djem, Bangando, Bakwele and Zime tribes. Non-indigenous employees of logging companies and traders make up a sizeable amount of the population. The population density of the region is about five people per square kilometer, concentrated along the main Yokadouma-Moloundou road. The villages around the park are mostly homogeneous as there are few non-natives, most of whom work as civil servants or traders. BiodiversityFlora= As with Boumba-Bek to the northeast, the main type of forest is semi-evergreen with an open canopy dominated by the 50‚Äì60 m Triplochiton, though it is mixed with large patches of closed evergreens. There are also some seasonally flooded Uapaca trees along the Dja River. =Fauna= Nki National Park hosts about 3,000 African forest elephants as of 2006. Nki, according to the Environmental News Service, \\"encompass[es] a biodiverse group of plants and animals.\\" This has been confirmed by various studies over the years. Sitatunga, chimpanzees, forest antelope (largely duikers), bushbucks, giant forest hogs, bush pigs, leopard, Nile crocodiles and bongos are all found in Nki National Park, along with \\"hundreds\\" of fish species. The forests of Cameroon contain some of the highest population density of forest elephants of any nation, and Nki is no different, with an elephant density of roughly 2.5 per square kilometer for Boumba Bek and Nki combined. The population has been steadily rising, from 1,547 in 1998 to 3,000 in 2006. Gorillas are also reported to abundant; there are an estimated 6,000 adults in Nki. The park is also home to diurnal primates, such as the threatened crested monkey, De Brazza monkey, and the black colobus, who reportedly only live east of the Dja River. A 20-day study held by BirdLife International discovered 265 species of birds in the park. Of these, the yellow-bellied form of forest robin is widespread. In the study, a pair of Dja River scrub warblers was discovered in a 1 hectare patch of Rhynchospora marsh; its population must be small as there are few such marshes in Nki. Three species of forest nightjar have been observed in the park; Bate's and brown nightjars are common in southeastern Cameroon, while a rarer and unidentified third species' call has been heard twice. It is likely that this is Prigogine's nightjar, as its voice is identical to that of the only known specimen of this species which was found in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Two small owls, Sjostedt's and African barred owlets coexist in Nki, due to similar habitat requirements.

It is a nocturnal and pair-living species. Groups can range from 2 (the parental pair only) to 5 individuals (including the offspring of subsequent years). A study in Sainte Luce forest revealed home range varied from 2.2 to 3.5 ha and that males can have larger home range and cover longer daily distances than females (which can spend more time feeding), in agreement with the territory defence and mate guarding hypotheses. Distribution The species is restricted to the reserve of Andohahela and the area of Sainte Luce. Further studies are required to determine the exact distribution range and especially the limits with its sister species Peyrieras' woolly lemur (A. peyrierasi). In southeastern littoral forests, sympatric lemur species of Avahi meridionalis are the brown mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus), the greater dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus major), the fat-tailed dwarf lemur Cheirogaleus medius and the collared brown lemur (Eulemur collaris) in Sainte Luce Forest, and the southern lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur meridionalis) in Mandena Forest. Description Dorsal fur is grey-brown toning down to light grey distally, while ventrum is grey. The tail is red-brown and darkens distally. The southern woolly lemur has a mean weight of for females and for males, with a mean head-body length of and for females and males, respectively. Diet Avahi meridionalis eats leaves (and buds) and, much more rarely, flowers and appears not to base food choice on abundance. Avahi meridionalis can eat adult leaves with higher content of easily soluble protein (than non-food leaves) and switch, as soon as possible, on young leaves, richer in crude protein, and poorer in acid detergent fiber and sugar. In Sainte Luce, A. meridionalis also ate leaves with condensed tannins, alkaloids, and intermediate concentrations of polyphenolics. Contrary to previous studies that considered Avahi spp. a specialist, A. meridionalis acted as leaf eating generalists with moderate selectivity, based on nutritional quality and tolerance of a wide array of plant secondary metabolites. Conservation The southern woolly lemur lives primarily in fragments of south-eastern rain littoral forest of Madagascar (Mandena and Sainte Luce). Degradation level, more than fragment size, seems to affect density and birth rates of the populations of this species.

She began her career in the USSR and, although winning several important competitions in the West, was denied permission by the Soviet government to accept any performance engagements outside of the Soviet bloc. Frustrated by her career limitations, she emigrated to the United States in 1977. Described by The New York Times as an \\"internationally known virtuoso\\" and \\"one of the country's most distinguished musical residents\\", Yablonskaya has toured in concert and recital throughout the world and has made numerous recordings. She taught as a member of the piano faculty at the Juilliard School for more than 30 years, until 2009. Life Born in Moscow to a Jewish family, Yablonskaya was a pupil of pianist Anaida Sumbatyan at the Moscow Central School for the Gifted where she studied from the ages of six through sixteen. She then pursued further studies in her native city with Alexander Goldenweiser upon entering the Moscow Conservatory as well as Goldenweiser's Assistant Dmitry Bashkirov. She was a student of Tatiana Nikolayeva in her Doctorate program. After graduating from the conservatory in 1965, she joined the school's piano faculty. She went on to win top prizes in the Long-Thibaud-Crespin Competition in 1963, Rio de Janeiro Piano Competition in 1965 and the Vienna Beethoven Competition in 1969. Yablonskaya was invited to perform with orchestras and in concert halls in the West during the 1960s and 1970s, but was never allowed to accept the engagements by the Soviet government. She also performed throughout the USSR and made numerous recordings on the Melodya label. She was named a \\"Soloist of the Moscow Philharmonic\\" and was also highly active as a soloist with the Bolshoi Orchestra. In 1975 Yablonskaya, along with her father and son, applied for a visa to emigrate to the United States, a move which caused her to be fired from her post at the Moscow Conservatory and which blacklisted her from all concert venues in the USSR. She waited for over two years to obtain a visa which was approved largely due to a petition which had been organized by American composers, conductors, musicians, movie actors, writers and senators such as Elie Wiesel, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim, Kathryn Hepburn, Shelley Winters, Norman Mailer, Henry F. Miller and many others. The family came to New York City in 1977 and later that year Yablonskaya gave a critically acclaimed recital at Carnegie Hall. This launched her career in the west, and she went on to appear with many of the world's finest symphony orchestras. As recording artist, Oxana Yablonskaya recorded for labels such as Melodiya, Connoisseur Society, Naxos, Bel Air, Pro Piano. Mme. Yablonskaya is the Winner of Grand Prix du Disque from the Liszt Society in Budapest for her recording of music by Schubert-Liszt and Liszt. She is an Honorary Academician of the International Academy of the Arts at the United Nations, International Academy of the Arts in San Francisco and Independent Academy of Liberal Arts at the Russian Academy of Sciences. She is recipient of the Einstein Medal for Outstanding Achievements in the Arts. Yablonskaya is Online Master Teacher at iClassical Academy with whom she has recorded several online Masterclasses. Yablonskaya's son, Dmitry Yablonsky, has become a noted cellist. Educated at Juilliard, he has become principal cellist of the Bergen Symphony Orchestra in Norway, and they have given mother and son recitals to critical acclaim.

Early life and education John Griswold White was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1845 to Bushnell and Elizabeth Brainard (Clark) White, both originally from Massachusetts. White's birthplace was located on what was then Lake Street (near the present-day City Hall). Both of John Griswold White's parents valued education, and Bushnell White once wrote a letter to the Cleveland Herald and Gazette in March 1847 that read in part: \\"Freedom and equal rights have ever, and always will, exist in proportion to the knowledge of the people.\\" Bushnell White graduated from Williams College, and Elizabeth White graduated from Troy (NY) Female Seminary. John G. White was born near-sighted but was not diagnosed until he was a teenager. Although fitted with glasses eventually, White usually read without them, preferring (according to his contemporaries) to hold the books close to his face. White received early education in Little Red School House of Northford, Connecticut, at Home, and Canandaigua Academy. According to his long-time friend, it is in Connecticut that White gained his ability to read fast, where books and money were scarce. White made a friend in the nearby town with the bookseller, who allowed him to read any book while his mother did her weekly shopping. Further education took place at Central High School in Cleveland and Western Reserve College in Hudson, Ohio, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. It was at college that White continued his love of books and libraries. Two of White's favorite professors at Western Reserve College were Nathan Perkins Seymour (classics) and Charles Augustus Young (mathematics and science). White continued his love of chess in college, and he and Young played every Wednesday evening, often into the early hours of the morning. White was the salutatorian at Western Reserve College at his 1865 graduation, delivering the address in Latin. After graduation, he studied law under his father. Career In 1868, White was admitted to the Ohio Bar, and practiced in the U.S. District and Northern District of Ohio. In 1903, he was admitted to the U.S. Court of Appeals, and to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1910, receiving the degree of Doctor of Laws from Western Reserve in 1919. White practiced law in 1870, partnering with Robert E. Mix and Judge Conway W. Noble. The law firm had various names due to partners either dying, retiring, or through consolidation. The law firm, currently named Schneider Smeltz Spieth Bell LLP, remains in existence today. One of White's most prominent cases was as special counsel for the Cleveland Railway in litigation against Tom L. Johnson over the Municipal Railway. Later, he helped Federal Judge Robert W. Tayler in writing the Tayler grant. White also was the attorney for the Catholic Diocese of Northern Ohio under three bishops, though White himself was not Catholic. White was elected to the Cleveland Public Library's Board of Directors for the first time on May 5, 1884. He was elected President at a meeting of the \\"Board of Managers of the Public Library\\" on May 13, 1884, and served the following year in 1885 as President, also. He became Library Board President again in 1910 until his death in 1928. He also helped appoint William Brett as director and Linda Eastman as Brett's successor. Marilla Waite Freeman served as head of the library's Main Library building during White's tenure.Letters from White to Freeman in the Cleveland Public Library Digital Gallery In 1884, Cleveland Public Library was thought to be mismanaged. Together with William Brett, White began a survey to discover how other libraries were being managed. In succeeding years, this led to: a newer shelf-classification system for the Cleveland Public Library derived from the Dewey Decimal System; an open-shelf system allowing patrons access to the collection; and establishing branches, sub-branches, deposit stations, and delivery stations. White, being concerned about Cleveland Public Library staff, established one of the earliest staff annuity plans for public employees. Personal life When taking walks, John and his father would engage in intellectual activities such as only speaking Latin one day, Greek another, and having a \\"Chess Day\\" where they would play chess by memory with neither pieces nor a board. White loved romantic novels and stories of the Wild West, in which reading was his primary relaxation. His house on 1871 East 89th Street was permeated with novels and hundreds of books on chess. White wore a beard long after it became unfashionable. He never owned an automobile, and often rode streetcars between his home on Bolton Street, and later East 89th Street and his office downtown. White was a bachelor until his death at age 83. John G. White Collection John Griswold White began donating books to the Cleveland Public Library in 1885, presenting William H. Brett with 122 maps and four books. By 1913, the number had reached 25.000. It was that same year in 1913 the Cleveland Public Library moved to the Kinney-Levan building on upper Euclid Avenue. This warehouse-looking building provided William H. Brett with space to open White's collection to the public. John G. White's fascination with chess was lifelong, from the \\"chess walks\\" with his father to his collecting chess-related books, information, and materials. \\"Over a period of some fifty years he conducted a determined quest, throughout the world, for desirable additions to his library,\\" the chess master and author Al Horowitz wrote in 1969. White's donation of folklore and Orientalia books to the library was influenced by the fact that the library had few books about the Philippines, which the United States acquired, and the major reduction in funds by Mayor Robert McKisson. Thus, when Brett asked for advice on library financial assistance, White agreed to help out by purchasing books out of his own pocket. After White left the Cleveland Public Library Board in 1886, he noticed the library purchased cheaper, popular books, which prompted him to donate scholarly books to the library. Also, to fill the void of his mother passing away, he had a vision of public service to the Cleveland Public Library. White owned two personal copies of Das erste Jartausend der Schachlitteratur (850-1880) zusammengestellt (The First Thousand Years of Chess Literature (850-1880) Compiled) by Antonius van der Linde and turned one into a personal inventory of his collection of books. White would note the items he owned within the text of the book itself but note new titles published since 1880 on a blank page inserted behind each page of van der Linde's work. White's goal was to collect everything published specifically on chess as well as chess manuscripts and any other texts that mentioned or were related to chess,Das erste Jartausend der Schachlitteratur (850-1880) zusammengestellt (digitized), Digital Gallery, Cleveland Public Library (e.g., Through the Looking-Glass, Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam). Chess historian H. J. R. Murray, who called White's chess library the largest in the world, made extensive use of the collection in writing his classic treatise A History of Chess.H. J. R. Murray, A History of Chess, Oxford University Press, 1913, pp. 179, 353, 479, 573-79, 645, 735, 787, 789, 800, 822, 841. . White donated his collection to the Cleveland Public Library to form the John G. White Collection on Folklore, Orientalia, and Chess. At the time of John. G. White's death in 1928, the valuable collection numbered 60,000 volumes. Gordon W. Thayer shaped the collection through his perceptive knowledge and patterns set by White's will. In 1969, an exhibit titled: \\"The Remarkable Mr. White,\\" included medieval manuscripts, 16th century chivalry romances, treatises on astrology and witchcraft, books of proverbs and folklore, early dictionaries and grammars in some 7,000 languages represented in the collection and personal diaries. The library has since split the collection into three: * The John G. White Chess and Checkers Collection is described as the \\"[l]argest chess library in the world (32,568 volumes of books and serials, including 6,359 volumes of bound periodicals.)\\" * The John G. White Folklore Collection contains 47,040 volumes, \\"one of the largest in the nation. It is broadly defined in scope and international in coverage without period restrictions. Included are primitive, peasant, native, and folk cultures within geographic restrictions.\\" * The John G. White Collection of Orientalia includes \\"materials on Asia, the Near and Middle East, Africa, Australia and Oceania,\\" emphasizing \\"the humanistic and social science aspects of traditional cultures prior to the impact of European influence.\\"Cleveland Public Library, Special Collections Death Mr. White left Cleveland for a fishing trip at his favorite mountain resort in Jackson Lake, Wyoming with his friend and former law associate T.A. McCaslin for a fishing trip. Four weeks into his vacation, White passed away from pneumonia on August 27, 1928. The funeral service was held at the First Unitarian Church on Euclid Avenue and East 82nd Street, with the Reverend Dilworth Lupton conducting. In attendance were Judge John C. Hutchins, and many of White's young apprentices from his White, Cannon, & Spieth Firm. The Cleveland Public Library closed its doors in the afternoon. In attendance were the Cleveland Public Library administrators, the library's board members, and over 100 librarians who passed Mr. White in Cleveland Public Library halls with occasional glances. The Reverend Lupton stated \\"Mr. White was a man rich of deeds, a man who shunned the limelight and publicity. His friends speak of his honesty, courageous thinking and speaking. His love of nature, people and books. He was a man who grew around him a group of friends to whom he was constantly loyal.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Diary and Views of Fishing Trips - An 18-volume series of scrapbooks of photographs and notes compiled by John G.

The site was created by GarageGames after being acquired by IAC/InterActive Corp in 2007 and released a year later. InstantAction's goal was to allow publishers and developers the ability to embed games across the internet through the use of InstantAction's embed-tech. Publishers were then able to set monetary rates, including social features, release free demos and more.IAC and GarageGames announce InstantAction.com, the first browser- based Action Game Network Users were required to download an initial plug-in that would be used across all games using the InstantAction platform. Game downloads were transparently broken into small \\"chunks\\", which were streamed onto disk behind the scenes, allowing players to start playing much faster than ordinary downloads. The games were downloaded to the user's hard-drive, allowing them to play the game instantly after initial download, wherever the game was embedded.Torque 3D Web Publishing and InstantAction Technology Explained InstantAction's platform initially hosted eight games that featured the ability to add friends, chat, and create parties which could jump from game to game together without being forced to leave the party and rejoin it. In 2010, these games were taken down after InstantAction announced it was focusing on embedded 3D gaming technology for external websites, rather than operating its own website. Several developers have shown interest in releasing said games at some point, however.

The team was undefeated in its first college season of 1922‚Äì23 and became national champions. It was not until February 1924 that the team suffered its first defeat, by Butler University, ending a string of 50 consecutive victories over a 2-season span. After ending the 1923 season undefeated, the \\"Wonder Five\\" were proclaimed nationally; the Detroit Free Press wrote: \\"Not only has this team been the best Franklin College ever had, but it is considered as the best collegiate team ever seen in Hoosierdom, the basketball center of the world.\\" Later Coach Wagner turned down an offer to play the New York Celtics, the top professional team in the nation, saying his team was \\"ready for a rest\\". The leading scorer on the Wonder Five was \\"Fuzzy\\" Vandivier. In 1924, the Chicago Tribune named him one of the \\"Five Best Players\\" in the nation. Coach John Wooden, of UCLA fame, considered Fuzzy the greatest high school basketball player he had ever seen. After graduation, Vandivier returned to Franklin High School as the basketball coach. In 1939 he led the team to a runner-up in the state basketball tournament. He retired from coaching in 1944 but continued as the school's athletic director, as well as teaching history. Since the years of the \\"Wonder Five\\", the Franklin High School team took the nickname of Grizzly Cubs, and Franklin College athletic teams took the Grizzlies, both in honor of \\"Griz\\" Wagner. In 1980, Franklin College unveiled a banner proclaiming the \\"Wonder Five\\" as national college champions of 1923. In popular culture In 1986, Phillip Ellett wrote a history of the team, entitled The Franklin Wonder Five: A Complete History of the Legendary Basketball Team.The Franklin Wonder Five: A Complete History of the Legendary Basketball Team In 2018, the Franklin Wonder Five website was launched.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and a member of the provincial cabinet under Premier John Norquay. Brown was born in Southampton, New Brunswick in 1848, training as a civil engineer before moving west and homesteading 320 acres (two quarter-sections) in the area of what is now Gladstone, Manitoba. He worked as a surveyor, then opened a number of businesses and became a railroad director. In 1874 he ran for the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the riding of Westbourne. Following his election he found himself allied with Norquay, a non-partisan moderate. When Norquay became premier of a coalition government in 1878, Brown was offered a cabinet position as Provincial Secretary; two years later, he was named Minister of Public Works. One of Brown's most important tasks during his time at Public Works was to convince the serving Prime Minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald, that the future of Manitoba depended on the issuing of railway charters (disallowed by Ottawa). He also presided over the construction of roads and the drainage of much of Manitoba's swampland. His duties were hampered by attacks by Liberal partisans and the Winnipeg Free Press, both of which called him a \\"boodle politician\\", and by lack of support on the part of Norquay and his other allies. Brown was eventually demoted back to Provincial Secretary before retiring from the cabinet. In 1888, he failed to secure the nomination for Westbourne for the Conservative party. He died in Winnipeg in 1891 at the age of 43 of pneumonia. Brown was married twice, first to Emma Davidson of Gladstone, then to Jennie Davidson (Emma's younger sister). He had six children. Corydon Avenue in Winnipeg was named after Corydon Partlow Brown. References * Corydon Partlow Brown, Dictionary of Canadian Biography; ed. Ramsay Cook. Volume XII; pages 128-129.

Summary  The short opens with a long shot of a large, urban building swaying in time to the loud strains of \\"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight\\" within, added to the film in later years. Next, the entrance to the \\"Whoopee Club\\" is shown with letters spelling out the name of the establishment one at a time. The camera, and therefore the viewer, is \\"brought into\\" the club through the front door. A group of anthropomorphic barnyard animals, among them Felix the Cat, are shown drinking and carousing. Felix himself is first shown standing atop a table with a foaming mug of beer in hand. Party horns are blown and confetti is thrown in the air as Felix downs his mug of beer. At home is the unnamed \\"Mrs. Felix.\\" She is first seen seated by a grandfather clock showing a time of 2:00. A rolling pin is in her right hand and her frequent looks at the time and her angry expressions make it clear as to her intended use of the implement. The next scene is back at the Whoopee Club. Felix and a female rabbit are shown dancing solo in what appears to be a dance contest. The couple stops and each pulls out a bottle of beer from within their selves and drink them in unison to the cheers of the onlooking animals. A clock tower showing a time of 3:00 raises its own dome. A hammer at the end of a mechanical arm extends out toward the left and strikes the hour on the dome; the moon has a face a la the man in the moon which visibly reacts to the sounding of the clock tower. Things are starting to quiet down in The Whoopee Club, but Felix continues to revel with party favors, using one to retrieve a bottle of beer from an unsuspecting rabbit patron. He downs the bottle, laughing the entire time and pirouettes into the camera, momentarily obscuring the scene until he pirouettes away, still laughing. Mrs. Felix is now shown waiting and pacing by the grandfather clock (which shows a time of 3:30) in much the same style as her husband. An inebriated Felix waves a goodbye through the front door of the club to the patrons inside, falling off the front step as he turns to leave. He tips the entire top of his head as if it were a hat and staggers toward the camera and out of frame to the left. Felix's hallucinations now begin in earnest as he staggers down the street with the surrounding buildings swaying in time to his steps. He staggers toward a street lamp and hugs the base for support. The lamp seems to come to life, kicking Felix away and then dusting itself off with a whisk broom. The lamp flings the broom in Felix's face and walks away. Felix tries to remove the broom, but the bristles remain in his face which he strokes as if it were a natural beard. He removes his tail, turns it into a walking stick and staggers after the street lamp in the manner of an arthritic old man. The lamp is seen sashaying down the street as if it were a woman with Felix in slow pursuit. The broom falls from Felix's face as he in turn falls to his knees, begging the street lamp to stop. Felix once again tips his ears in a salute; the street lamp reacts as if it were a shy young girl. Felix attempts to steady himself at the base of the lamp, but it shifts slightly causing him to fall. The lamp reacts with a funny little dance which infuriates Felix. He lunges for the street lamp which now turns into a sort of smoke-blowing dragon. Felix turns and runs toward the camera while the dragon's open mouth momentarily obscures the scene as it begins its pursuit. By now, the hallucinations are becoming more vivid. The street and buildings undulate with Felix's steps. When he stops and sees no dragon behind him, he laughs it off until it suddenly reappears before him. Felix produces an atomizer and \\"extinguishes\\" the dragon, which disappears. The tip of Felix's tail was left slightly smoking, so he removes the tip and begins to smoke it as if it were a cigar. The hallucinations continue as we see a charging elephant, lion and gorilla begin their pursuit. As Felix turns to run, a second lion appears, blocking his path. Felix's sudden lunge away from the lion flings him head first into a distant tree. More hallucinations appear in the form of a second elephant which morphs into a winged ape. Proud of his escape from this latest danger, Felix produces another bottle of alcohol from his person and takes a swig. The bottle immediately produces a giant, striped snakelike creature with stubby legs and an odd protrusion on its head. This creature morphs into a small automobile. Felix removes his tail and uses it as a crank to start the engine. He speeds away and drives through an intersection controlled by a traffic policeman. The policeman turns toward Felix's wrecked car, puffs out his chest and shoots out the buttons of his uniform as if they were bullets. Felix is flung into the air, coming down to land in the mouth of a fish which then morphs into a saxophone which in turn spits out Felix. The saxophone then morphs into a bugle which sprouts legs and a horselike tail and takes off after the fleeing Felix. Felix's pursuits end as he enters the front door of his home. He peeks through the keyhole and sees a bizarre, round-bodied creature flapping its wings and blinking its eyes. Felix laughs off this latest hallucination, removes his tail and inserts it into an umbrella stand. As he laughs and staggers, he suddenly remembers his wife, still pacing before the clock which now reads 6:00. Felix removes his shoes at the foot of the stairs before tiptoeing up. The stairs move as if they were piano keys as Felix falls to the foot of the stairs. Another hallucination begins; Felix finds himself back outside as a chicken laughs at his plight. As he begins to beat up the chicken, we see that in reality he is standing at the foot of his wife's bed punching out a feather pillow. An alarm clock on the windowsill shows a time of 3:00, but when Mrs. Felix kicks Felix off the bed, he lands in front of a cuckoo clock displaying a time of 6:00. As the cuckoo clock chimes six, Felix draws a large pistol from his pajamas and shoots the cuckoo. The effect of the explosion fades the cartoon to black, ending the story.

Early life and marriages Jorgensen was born to a well-to-doRonnie and Nancy: Their Path to the White House--1911 to 1980 By Bob Colacello retrieved January 14, 2012 family in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Nellie and Leroy Newbert. Her family's wealth can be attributed to her grandfather, Thomas Griffin, an Irish immigrant, who was the founder of a very successful company which manufactured railway wheels in Baltimore. In 1913, her family traveled west to Los Angeles by private railroad car. Marion attended Marlborough School, a college- preparatory academy. She obtained her pilot license by the age of 17, and went on to attend the liberal-arts Finch College in New York City. In 1930, she returned to Los Angeles and, despite being Christian and attending exclusive schools which restricted their enrollees to gentiles, she married Jewish- American talent agent, Milton Harold Bren. Bren would go on to become a movie producer and real estate developer. They had two sons: Donald Bren, who later became chairman of the Irvine Company in Newport Beach, California, and Peter Bren, who is now a senior partner with KBS Investors in New York City. In the 1940s, while Europe was at war, Marion founded the \\"Bundles for Britain\\" (note: Lady Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton was also credited with founding Bundles for Britain in 1940);https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/world/europe/lady- malcolm-douglas-hamilton-dies-at-103-aided-britain-in-war.html?_r=0) organization, which provided non-military aid to the British people. Women joined the organization and made clothing, which was sent overseas. Upon the entrance of the United States into the war, Bundles for Britain evolved into the United States Naval Aide Auxiliary. Marion served as president of the organization. In 1948, the couple divorced. Marion then married Tom Call, the son of Asa Call, chairman of the Pacific Mutual Life Company and to whom the rapid ascent of Richard Nixon from representative to president is widely attributed. They divorced in 1952. Marion began doing volunteer work for the American Red Cross, where she met Danish American steel entrepreneur Earle M. Jorgensen through Hollywood connections. They were married in 1953 and remained married until his death in 1999. Jorgensen, the son of Danish immigrants to San Francisco, made his fortune by selling surplus steel to oil drillers and later in the aircraft industry. He eventually turned his company, the Earle M. Jorgensen Company, to a $100 million in sales by 1960. Socialite and philanthropy The Jorgensens were among the social elite of Los Angeles. She began working with St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, where she coordinated events and recruited volunteers. She hosted the dinner for Prince Charles, as well as the Black and White Ball with Bob Hope. The Jorgensens became good friends with Ronald and Nancy Reagan in the early 1960s. Earle Jorgensen urged Ronald Reagan to run for Governor of California in 1966, a position Reagan won. Earle Jorgensen would later become a member of Reagan's White House \\"Kitchen Cabinet\\". The Jorgsensens became very active philanthropists; they donated money to many charitable causes and civic organizations, such as the Boy Scouts of America, the YMCA, the Los Angeles Music Center, and several hospitals. The Jorgensens supported the California Institute of Technology, and established the Earle and Marion Jorgensen Scholarship Fund as a means to assist students. It helps undergraduates financially. Caltech President David Baltimore said, \\"We are truly grateful to Earle and to his wife, Marion, for their many years of friendship and support.\\" Included among the other philanthropic endeavors that benefited from Mrs. Jorgensen's support over the years were the Los Angeles Orphanage Guild, the ARCS Foundation, the American Red Cross, Loyola Marymount University, and the Prince of Wales Foundation. Committee and board work Jorgensen served on the First Step Committee at St. John's and co-chaired the Campaign Cabinet to lead the Campaign for St. John's. She served as a leader on many important committees including the Board Affairs and the Executive Committee. With her assistance, the small community hospital was able to rebuild from the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Additionally, Mrs. Jorgensen was an Honorary Trustee of Children's Hospital Los Angeles and served on the board of The Colleagues. After serving with distinction on the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, Mrs. Jorgensen was honored with election as Life Director. She also became the first female to serve as chairman of the board of overseers of the Huntington Library Art Gallery and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California. For her help and service in developing the world-famous botanical gardens, she was elected Trustee Emeritus. Jorgensen also had musical interests. She served as director of the Los Angeles Symphony Association, on the President's Blue Ribbon 400 for the Los Angeles Music Center, and was a member of the Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. She helped found the James Madison Council of the Library of Congress, the first-ever national advisory and support group in its 205-year history. Marion Jorgensen also served as a member of the board of Continental Airlines and Frontier Airlines. Later life and death Jorgensen's husband Earle died in 1999. Throughout May 2007, Mrs. Jorgensen donated roughly $7,000 to the 2008 presidential campaign of John McCain. In October of that year, Mrs. Jorgensen was honored by the St. John's Health Center Foundation Board of Trustees with the Spirit of St. John's Award in recognition of her lifelong contributions to the center. The award honors an individual whose vision, determination and generosity of spirit have advanced the mission of St. John's. Marion Jorgensen died on June 18, 2008 at St. John's Health Center, the very place where she volunteered often. She was 96. Jorgensen is survived by her sons, Peter Bren and Donald Bren, four Jorgensen children, and many grandchildren and great- grandchildren.

It invests globally, looking for strong businesses with above-average returns. Scottish Mortgage is managed by Baillie Gifford & Co Limited, the Edinburgh- based investment management partnership. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. History The origins of Scottish Mortgage lie in a credit crisis, the Panic of 1907. By 1909 the growing popularity of the motorcar, including the Model T Ford, was creating significant demand for tyres, which rubber planters in Southeast Asia were keen to exploit, but credit was still difficult to obtain. In Edinburgh, the recently formed legal partnership between Colonel Augustus Baillie and Carlyle Gifford (which ultimately became Baillie Gifford & Co) spotted an opportunity. They established The Straits Mortgage and Trust Company Limited to lend money to the planters, secured on the rubber estates.Burns, Page 6 Within a couple of years, however, the credit crisis was over and rubber planters no longer required finance from Straits Mortgage on the scale anticipated. In 1913, the Trust's investment remit was widened to include bond and equity markets worldwide, and its name changed to The Scottish Mortgage and Trust Company Limited.Certificate of Name Change No. 7058, 28 May 1913 > ‚ÄúBy 1913 it was obvious the future of the trust lay in operating as a normal > investment trust ‚Äì that is to say, one which invested in a broad range of > securities, very largely overseas, as was typical of Scottish investment > trusts of the period, with a strong bias towards North America ‚Äì rather than > the Rubber plantation specialist that had originally been envisaged.

By 1940, 22 per cent of the portfolio was invested in US names.Scottish Mortgage Annual Report and Accounts 1940 Soon after, however, the British government mandated the sale and repatriation of all American securities owned by British citizens, including those of Scottish Mortgage. The government's representative overseeing this formidable exercise was Carlyle Gifford. The proportion invested in the US fell to 6.6 per cent by 1942,The Scottish Mortgage and Trust Company Limited, Chairman's Speech to the AGM, 21 May 1942 not to be rebuilt until the 1950s.Scottish Mortgage Annual Report and Accounts 1957 By 1957, in the midst of the post-War boom in equities, the chairman noted, \\"...we have over 44 per cent of our assets...in USA and Canada. Indeed, a higher proportion would have been even better\\".Scottish Mortgage Annual Report and Accounts 1957, Chairman's Statement In the 1960s, the Trust was among the first to take advantage of the lifting of restrictions on foreigners investing in the burgeoning Japanese market; a sound investment decision, but a controversial one with wartime memories still fresh.Burns, Pages 89,90 The amount invested in the UK allocation has also varied. During the early 1970s, UK equities and bonds fell from 63 per cent in 1972Scottish Mortgage Annual Report and Accounts 1973, Chairman's Statement to nearly 45 per cent of the Trust two years later.Scottish Mortgage Annual Report and Accounts 1975 While some of this decline reflects steep relative falls in the UK stock market, it also reflects a deliberate move away from the UK. The exasperation of the chairman comes through in his 1975 statement: \\"The fact is that this country has got itself into a really dreadful mess... We continue to have more confidence in investment prospects overseas than in the UK\\".Scottish Mortgage Annual Report and Accounts 1975, Chairman's Statement Dividends Over the entire history of Scottish Mortgage, it has cut its dividend only once, in 1933 - after the effects of the Depression ravaged its portfolio.Burns, Page 32 In every other year, it either maintained or increased its dividend, even during both World Wars. In 1942 the chairman wrote with masterly understatement of \\"some important adverse influences... Our revenue has suffered from the almost complete stoppage of dividends from the invaded areas\\". Present day Scottish Mortgage celebrated its centenary year in 2009. Investments continue to reflect the global-nature of the Trust with holdings in fast-growing economies such as China and Brazil.

The safety of high energy particle collisions was a topic of widespread discussion and topical interest during the time when the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and later the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)‚Äîcurrently the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator‚Äîwere being constructed and commissioned. Concerns arose that such high energy experiments‚Äîdesigned to produce novel particles and forms of matter‚Äîhad the potential to create harmful states of matter or even doomsday scenarios. Claims escalated as commissioning of the LHC drew closer, around 2008‚Äì2010. The claimed dangers included the production of stable micro black holes and the creation of hypothetical particles called strangelets, and these questions were explored in the media, on the Internet and at times through the courts. To address these concerns in the context of the LHC, CERN mandated a group of independent scientists to review these scenarios. In a report issued in 2003, they concluded that, like current particle experiments such as the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), the LHC particle collisions pose no conceivable threat.Blaizot JP, Iliopoulos J, Madsen J, Ross GG, Sonderegger P, Specht HJ (2003). Study of Potentially Dangerous Events During Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC. CERN. Geneva. CERN-2003-001. A second review of the evidence commissioned by CERN was released in 2008. The report, prepared by a group of physicists affiliated to CERN but not involved in the LHC experiments, reaffirmed the safety of the LHC collisions in light of further research conducted since the 2003 assessment.\\"The safety of the LHC\\". CERN 2008 (CERN website). It was reviewed and endorsed by a CERN committee of 20 external scientists and by the Executive Committee of the Division of Particles & Fields of the American Physical Society,CERN Scientific Policy Committee (2008). SPC Report on LSAG Documents. CERN record.\\"Statement by the Executive Committee of the DPF on the Safety of Collisions at the Large Hadron Collider \\" issued by the Division of Particles & Fields (DPF) of the American Physical Society (APS) and was later published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Physics G by the UK Institute of Physics, which also endorsed its conclusions.\\"LHC switch-on fears are completely unfounded\\". The Institute of Physics. PR 48 (08). 5 September 2008. The report ruled out any doomsday scenario at the LHC, noting that the physical conditions and collision events which exist in the LHC, RHIC and other experiments occur naturally and routinely in the universe without hazardous consequences, including ultra- high-energy cosmic rays observed to impact Earth with energies far higher than those in any man-made collider. Background CMS detector. Particle colliders are a type of particle accelerator used by physicists as a research tool to understand fundamental aspects of the universe. Their operation involves directed beams of particles accelerated to very high kinetic energy and allowed to collide; analysis of the byproducts of these collisions gives scientists good evidence of the structure of the subatomic world and the laws of nature governing it. These may become apparent only at high energies and for tiny periods of time, and therefore may be hard or impossible to study in other ways. Because of the high energy levels involved, concerns have arisen at times in the public arena as to whether such collisions are safe, or whether they might, by reason of their extreme energy, trigger unforeseen problems or consequences. = Examples of colliders = Concerns were noted during the construction of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which began operations in 2008, is the world's largest and highest-energy particle accelerator complex, intended to collide opposing beams of either protons or lead nuclei with very high kinetic energy.CERN Communication Group (January 2008). \\"CERN FAQ ‚Äî LHC: the guide \\" (PDF). CERN. Geneva (44p).Achenbach, Joel (1 March 2008). \\"The God Particle\\". National Geographic Magazine. It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva, in Switzerland. The LHC's main purpose is to explore the validity and limitations of the Standard Model, the current theoretical picture for particle physics. The first particle collisions at the LHC took place shortly after startup in November 2009, at energies up to per beam.CERN press release (2009) \\"LHC ends 2009 run on a high note.\\" On 30 March 2010, the first planned collisions took place between two 3.5 TeV beams, which set another new world record for the highest energy man-made particle collisions. In 2012 the beam energy was increased to 4 TeV, after upgrades in 2013 and 2014 collisions in 2015 and 2016 happened at an energy of 6.5 TeV per proton.Record breaking collision at 13TeV, CERN Press release Similar concerns had previously also been raised in the context of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, with Frank Close, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, to comment at the time that \\"the chance of [strangelet creation] is like you winning the major prize on the lottery 3 weeks in succession; the problem is that people believe it is possible to win the lottery 3 weeks in succession.\\"BBC End Days (Documentary)  Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  Concerns about possible adverse consequences were raised in connection with the RHIC particle accelerator.Matthews, Robert (28 August 1999). \\"A Black Hole Ate My Planet\\". New Scientist.Horizon: End Day. BBC. 2005. After detailed studies, scientists reached such conclusions as \\"beyond reasonable doubt, heavy-ion experiments at RHIC will not endanger our planet\\" and that there is \\"powerful empirical evidence against the possibility of dangerous strangelet production.\\" Before the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider started operation, critics postulated that the extremely high energy could produce catastrophic scenarios,T. D. Gutierrez, \\"Doomsday Fears at RHIC,\\" Skeptical Inquirer 24, 29 (May 2000) such as creating a black hole, a transition into a different quantum mechanical vacuum (see false vacuum), or the creation of strange matter that is more stable than ordinary matter. These hypotheses are complex, but many predict that the Earth would be destroyed in a time frame from seconds to millennia, depending on the theory considered. However, the fact that objects of the Solar System (e.g., the Moon) have been bombarded with cosmic particles of significantly higher energies than that of RHIC and other man made colliders for billions of years, without any harm to the Solar System, were among the most striking arguments that these hypotheses were unfounded. The other main controversial issue was a demand by critics for physicists to reasonably exclude the probability for such a catastrophic scenario. Physicists are unable to demonstrate experimental and astrophysical constraints of zero probability of catastrophic events, nor that tomorrow Earth will be struck with a \\"doomsday\\" cosmic ray (they can only calculate an upper limit for the likelihood). The result would be the same destructive scenarios described above, although obviously not caused by humans. According to this argument of upper limits, RHIC would still modify the chance for the Earth's survival by an infinitesimal amount. Concerns were raised in connection with the RHIC particle accelerator, both in the media and in the popular science media. The risk of a doomsday scenario was indicated by Martin Rees, with respect to the RHIC, as being at least a 1 in 50 million chance.Cf. Brookhaven Report mentioned by Rees, Martin (Lord), Our Final Century: Will the Human Race Survive the Twenty-first Century?, U.K., 2003, ; note that the mentioned \\"1 in 50 million\\" chance is disputed as being a misleading and played down probability of the serious risks (Aspden, U.K., 2006) With regards to the production of strangelets, Frank Close, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, indicates that \\"the chance of this happening is like you winning the major prize on the lottery 3 weeks in succession; the problem is that people believe it is possible to win the lottery 3 weeks in succession.\\" After detailed studies, scientists reached such conclusions as \\"beyond reasonable doubt, heavy-ion experiments at RHIC will not endanger our planet\\" and that there is \\"powerful empirical evidence against the possibility of dangerous strangelet production.\\" = History of discussion = The debate started in 1999 with an exchange of letters in Scientific American between Walter L. Wagner and F. Wilczek, in response to a previous article by M. Mukerjee. The media attention unfolded with an article in U.K. Sunday Times of July 18, 1999 by J. Leake,Sunday Times, 18 July 1999. closely followed by articles in the U.S. media.e.g. ABCNEWS.com, from the Internet Archive. The controversy mostly ended with the report of a committee convened by the director of Brookhaven National Laboratory, J. H. Marburger, ostensibly ruling out the catastrophic scenarios depicted. However, the report left open the possibility that relativistic cosmic ray impact products might behave differently while transiting earth compared to \\"at rest\\" RHIC products; and the possibility that the qualitative difference between high-E proton collisions with earth or the moon might be different than gold on gold collisions at the RHIC. Wagner tried subsequently to stop full energy collision at RHIC by filing Federal lawsuits in San Francisco and New York City, but without success.e.g. NBC News, June 14, 2000. The New York suit was dismissed on the technicality that the San Francisco suit was the preferred forum. The San Francisco suit was dismissed, but with leave to refile if additional information was developed and presented to the court.United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, Case No. 00CV1672, Walter L. Wagner vs. Brookhaven Science Associates, L.L.C. (2000); United States District Court, Northern District of California, Case No. C99-2226, Walter L. Wagner vs. U.S. Department of Energy, et al. (1999) On March 17, 2005, the BBC published an articleBBC, 17 March 2005. implying that researcher Hora≈£iu NƒÉstase believes black holes have been created at RHIC. However, the original papers of H. NƒÉstase and the New Scientist articleE. S. Reich, New Scientist 185:2491, 16 (2005). cited by the BBC state that the correspondence of the hot dense QCD matter created in RHIC to a black hole is only in the sense of a correspondence of QCD scattering in Minkowski space and scattering in the AdS5 √ó X5 space in AdS/CFT; in other words, it is similar mathematically. Therefore, RHIC collisions might be described by mathematics relevant to theories of quantum gravity within AdS/CFT, but the described physical phenomena are not the same. Large Hadron Collider In the run up to the commissioning of the LHC, Walter L. Wagner (an original opponent of the RHIC), Luis Sancho (a Spanish science writer) and Otto R√∂ssler (a German biochemist) expressed concerns over the safety of the LHC, and attempted to halt the beginning of the experiments through petitions to the US and European Courts.Boyle, Alan (2 September 2008). \\"Courts weigh doomsday claims\\".

CERN Courier. CERN. According to the standard calculations these are harmless because they would quickly decay by Hawking radiation. Hawking radiation is a thermal radiation predicted to be emitted by black holes due to quantum effects. Because Hawking radiation allows black holes to lose mass, black holes that lose more matter than they gain through other means are expected to dissipate, shrink, and ultimately vanish. Smaller micro black holes (MBHs), which could be produced at the LHC, are currently predicted by theory to be larger net emitters of radiation than larger black holes, and to shrink and dissipate instantly.Cavagli√†, Marco (29 January 2007). \\"Particle accelerators as black hole factories?\\". Einstein-Online. Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute). The LHC Safety Assessment Group (LSAG) indicates that \\"there is broad consensus among physicists on the reality of Hawking radiation, but so far no experiment has had the sensitivity required to find direct evidence for it.\\" According to the LSAG, even if micro black holes were produced by the LHC and were stable, they would be unable to accrete matter in a manner dangerous for the Earth. They would also have been produced by cosmic rays and have stopped in neutron stars and white dwarfs, and the stability of these astronomical bodies means that they cannot be dangerous:Schewe, Phil (9 September 2008). \\"Mini Black Holes No Danger \\". Inside Science Research ‚Äî Physics news update. Number 871 #1. American Institute of Physics. Strangelets Strangelets are small fragments of strange matter‚Äîa hypothetical form of quark matter‚Äîthat contain roughly equal numbers of up, down, and strange quarks and that are more stable than ordinary nuclei (strangelets would range in size from a few femtometers to a few meters across). If strangelets can actually exist, and if they were produced at the LHC, they could conceivably initiate a runaway fusion process in which all the nuclei in the planet would be converted to strange matter, similar to a strange star. The probability of the creation of strangelets decreases at higher energies. As the LHC operates at higher energies than the RHIC or the heavy ion programs of the 1980s and 1990s, the LHC is less likely to produce strangelets than its predecessors. Furthermore, models indicate that strangelets are only stable or long-lived at low temperatures. Strangelets are bound at low energies (in the range of 1‚Äì10 MeV), while the collisions in the LHC release energies in the range of 7‚Äì14 TeV. Thermodynamics very strongly disfavors the formation of a cold condensate that is an order of magnitude cooler than the surrounding medium. As an example, it is about as likely as producing an icecube in a furnace. Concerns not meeting peer review Otto R√∂ssler, a German chemistry professor at the University of T√ºbingen, argues that micro black holes created in the LHC could grow exponentially.R√∂ssler, Otto (2008). \\"A Rational and Moral and Spiritual Dilemma \\".R√∂ssler, Otto (2008). \\"Abraham-Solution to Schwarzschild Metric Implies That CERN Miniblack Holes Pose a Planetary Risk \\".Patorski, Gregor (10 September 2008). \\"Gr√∂sstes Verbrechen der Menschheit\\" (in German). 20 Minuten.\\"Publicity f√ºr eine fragw√ºrdige Hypothese\\" (in German).

On 4 July 2008, R√∂ssler met with a CERN physicist, Rolf Landua, with whom he discussed his safety concerns.Schmidt, Von Wolf (7 September 2008). \\"Der Prophet des Planetentods\\" (in German). Taz.de. Following the meeting, Landua asked another expert, Hermann Nicolai, Director of the Albert Einstein Institute, in Germany, to examine R√∂ssler's arguments. Nicolai reviewed Otto R√∂ssler's research paper on the safety of the LHC and issued a statement highlighting logical inconsistencies and physical misunderstandings in R√∂ssler's arguments. Nicolai concluded that \\"this text would not pass the referee process in a serious journal.\\" Domenico Giulini also commented with Hermann Nicolai on Otto R√∂ssler's thesis, concluding that \\"his argument concerns only the General Theory of Relativity (GRT), and makes no logical connection to LHC physics; the argument is not valid; the argument is not self-consistent.\\"Giulini, Domenico; and Nicolai, Hermann (August 2008). On the arguments of O.E. R√∂ssler. On , a group of German physicists, the Committee for Elementary Particle Physics (KET), published an open letter further dismissing R√∂ssler's concerns and carrying assurances that the LHC is safe. Otto R√∂ssler was due to meet Swiss president Pascal Couchepin in August 2008 to discuss this concern,\\"Couchepin trifft Cern-Kritiker R√∂ssler\\" (in German). NZZ Online. . but it was later reported that the meeting had been canceled as it was believed R√∂ssler and his fellow opponents would have used the meeting for their own publicity.\\"Kein Gespr√§ch zwischen Couchepin und Cern-Kritiker\\" (in German). NZZ Online. . On , Rainer Plaga, a German astrophysicist, posted a research paper on the arXiv Web archive concluding that LHC safety studies have not definitely ruled out the potential catastrophic threat from microscopic black holes, including the possible danger from Hawking radiation emitted by black holes.Brean, Joseph (9 September 2008). \\"Is the end nigh? Science experiment could swallow Earth, critics say\\". National Post. In a follow-up paper posted on the arXiv on , Steven Giddings and Michelangelo Mangano responded to Plaga's concerns. They pointed out what they see as a basic inconsistency in Plaga's calculation, and argued that their own conclusions on the safety of the collider, as referred to in the LHC safety assessment (LSAG) report, remain robust. Giddings and Mangano also referred to the research paper \\"Exclusion of black hole disaster scenarios at the LHC\\", which relies on a number of new arguments to conclude that there is no risk due to mini black holes at the LHC. On 19 January 2009 Roberto Casadio, Sergio Fabi and Benjamin Harms posted on the arXiv a paper, later published on Physical Review D, ruling out the catastrophic growth of black holes in the scenario considered by Plaga. In reaction to the criticisms, Plaga updated his paper on the arXiv on 26 September 2008 and again on 9 August 2009. So far, Plaga's paper has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. = Safety reviews = CERN-commissioned reports Drawing from research performed to assess the safety of the RHIC collisions, the LHC Safety Study Group, a group of independent scientists, performed a safety analysis of the LHC, and released their findings in the 2003 report Study of Potentially Dangerous Events During Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC. The report concluded that there is \\"no basis for any conceivable threat\\". Several of its arguments were based on the predicted evaporation of hypothetical micro black holes by Hawking radiation (which yet was not confirmed experimentally) and on the theoretical predictions of the Standard Model with regard to the outcome of events to be studied in the LHC. One argument raised against doomsday fears was that collisions at energies equivalent to and higher than those of the LHC have been happening in nature for billions of years apparently without hazardous effects, as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays impact Earth's atmosphere and other bodies in the universe. In 2007, CERN mandated a group of five particle physicists not involved in the LHC experiments‚Äîthe LHC Safety Assessment Group (LSAG), consisting of John Ellis, Gian Giudice, Michelangelo Mangano and Urs Wiedemann, of CERN, and Igor Tkachev, of the Institute for Nuclear Research in Moscow‚Äîto monitor the latest concerns about the LHC collisions. On , in light of new experimental data and theoretical understanding, the LSAG issued a report updating the 2003 safety review, in which they reaffirmed and extended its conclusions that \\"LHC collisions present no danger and that there are no reasons for concern\\". The LSAG report was then reviewed by CERN‚Äôs Scientific Policy Committee (SPC), a group of external scientists that advises CERN‚Äôs governing body, its Council.\\"CERN Council looks forward to LHC start-up\\". PR05.08 (20 June 2008). CERN 2008. The report was reviewed and endorsed by a panel of five independent scientists, Peter Braun-Munzinger, Matteo Cavalli- Sforza, Gerard 't Hooft, Bryan Webber and Fabio Zwirner, and their conclusions were unanimously approved by the full 20 members of the SPC. On , the LSAG's \\"Review of the safety of LHC collisions\\" was published in the Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics by the UK Institute of Physics, which endorsed its conclusions in a press release that announced the publication. Following the July 2008 release of the LSAG safety report, the Executive Committee of the Division of Particles and Fields (DPF) of the American Physical Society, the world's second largest organization of physicists, issued a statement approving the LSAG's conclusions and noting that \\"this report explains why there is nothing to fear from particles created at the LHC\\".

PhysOrg.com. and a commentary article which appeared the same day in the journal Physics endorsed Giddings' and Mangano's conclusions. The LSAG report draws heavily on this research. On , a paper titled \\"Exclusion of black hole disaster scenarios at the LHC\\" was published in the journal Physics Letters B. The article, which summarizes proofs aimed at ruling out any possible black hole disaster at the LHC, relies on a number of new safety arguments as well as certain arguments already present in Giddings' and Mangano's paper \\"Astrophysical implications of hypothetical stable TeV-scale black holes\\". =Legal challenges= On , a complaint requesting an injunction to halt the LHC's startup was filed by Walter L.

Telegraph.co.uk. The suit, which was summarily rejected on the same day, alleged that the Large Hadron Collider posed grave risks for the safety of the 27 member states of the European Union and their citizens. Late in 2009 a review of the legal situation by Eric Johnson, a lawyer, was published in the Tennessee Law Review. In this paper, Johnson stated that \\"Given such a state, it is not clear that any particle-physics testimony should be allowed in the courtroom\\", in reference to the dual problems that (a) the scientific arguments regarding the risks are so complex that only persons who have devoted many years to particle physics study are competent to understand them, but (b) any such persons, by reason of this huge personal investment, will inevitably be highly biased in favor of the experiments, and also endangered by severe professional censure if they threaten their continuation.Johnson (2009), p.874 In February 2010 a summary of Johnson's article appeared as an opinion piece in New Scientist. In February 2010, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) rejected an injunction petition to halt the LHC's operation as unfounded, without hearing the case, stating that the opponents had failed to produce plausible evidence for their theories.BVerfG, 2 BvR 2502/08 vom 18.2.2010 A subsequent petition was rejected by the Administrative Court of Cologne in January 2011.Ruling of the Administrative Court of Cologne, Case Nr. 13 K 5693/08 (in German) An appeal against the latter ruling was rejected by the Higher Administrative Court of North Rhine- Westphalia in October 2012.Web portal of the Justice Ministry of North Rhine- Westphalia (in German) .

Early life Bracket clock by Daniel Quare on display at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool Daniel Quare's origins are obscure. He was possibly a native of Somerset, and is believed to have been born in 1648 or 1649. Nothing is known of his parentage, although he is presumed to have come from a strict Quaker family. No record has been traced of his apprenticeship. Career On 3 April 1671 he was admitted a brother of the Clockmakers' Company. One of the early members of the Friends' (Quakers') meeting at Devonshire House, he married there, on 18 April 1676, Mary, daughter of Jeremiah Stevens, maltster, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. In the register-book he is described as \\"clockmaker, of Martins-le-Grand in the liberty of Westminster\\". Soon afterwards, Quare moved to the parish of St Anne and St Agnes within Aldersgate, where in 1678, for refusing to pay a rate for the maintenance of the clergy of the parish, his goods to the value of ¬£5 were seized to defray a fine of ¬£2 12s. 6d. The next year, \\"for fines imposed for refusing to defray the charge of the militia, two clocks and two watches were taken from him\\". A little later he settled in Lombard Street, whence he migrated in 1685 to the King's Arms in Exchange Alley, long a favourite home for watchmakers. In 1683 Quare and five other Friends had \\"their goods seized to the value of ¬£195 17s. 6d. for attending meeting at White Hart Court\\". On 4 June 1686 Quare, with about fifty other Friends, was summoned to appear before the commissioners appointed by James II to sit at Clifford's Inn to hear their grievances. He was fined again in 1689, but he was subsequently taken into William III's favour. On Quare's petition two Friends imprisoned in Westmorland were released, and on 2 May 1695 he introduced four Friends, including George Whitehead and Gilbert Latey, to a private interview with William III. Quare and nineteen other quakers signed a petition to the commons, presented by Edmond Waller on 7 February 1696. When Quare began his career horology was rapidly advancing. The pendulum was a novelty; so were the spiral spring and anchor escapement invented by Robert Hooke, and the fusee chain. To Quare belongs the honour of inventing repeating watches, and it is also claimed for him that he adapted the concentric minute hand. If he was actually the inventor of the latter, he must have constructed it early in his career, for two concentric hands are shown in a diagram in Christiaan Huygens's Horologium Oscillatorium (1673).Christiaan Huygens, Horologium Oscillatorium (Paris, 1673), p. 4. Clocks and watches made by Quare with only one hand are extant, or with two circles and pointers, one for the hours and another for the minutes, and the concentric invention did not quickly supersede this arrangement even in Quare's own workshop. In the London Gazette for 25‚Äì29 March 1686, is an advertisement for a lost \\"pendulum\\" watch made by Quare, that had only one hand, but was curiously arranged to give the minutes: \\"it had but 6 hours upon the dial plate, with 6 small cipher figures within every hour; the hand going round every 6 hours, which shows also the minutes between every hour.\\" When in 1687 Edward Booth, alias Barlow, applied for a patent for \\"pulling or repeating clocks and watches\\", the Clockmakers' Company successfully opposed the application on the ground that the alleged invention was anticipated by a watch previously invented and made by Quare. The latter's watch was superior to Barlow's, because it repeated both the hour and the quarter with one pressure, while Barlow's required two. Wood gives an account of a watch made by Quare for James II, but the references are inaccurate.Wood, Curiosities of Clocks and Watches, p. 295 Quare is also said to have made a repeating watch for William III. He certainly made a very fine clock for the king, which went for a year without rewinding. Being specially made for a bedroom, it did not strike. The clock still stands in its original place, by the side of the king's bed, in Hampton Court Palace, and shows sundial time, latitude and longitude, and the course of the sun. In 1836 the clock was altered by Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy, the equation work being disconnected and partly removed, a new pendulum provided, and the clock fitted with a deadbeat escapement. The case is surmounted by five well-modelled gilt figures, the complete height being over ten feet. The going train is similar to another year clock made by Quare.Described in F. J. Britten says of it: \\"It seems almost incredible for 81 lb. √ó 4 ft. 6 in. to drive the clock for more than 13 months, but everything was done that was possible to economise the force. The very small and light swing wheel, the balanced minute hand, and the small shortened arbors with extra fine pivots, all conduce to the end in view.\\" The weight in the Hampton Court clock was still less, being only 72 lb. There is also at the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, a very curious clock by Quare with a double pendulum. On 2 August 1695, in the face of some opposition from the Clockmakers' Company, a patent was granted to Quare for a portable barometer. The barometer, in the words of the patent, \\"may be removed and carried to any place, though turned upside down, without spilling one drop of the quicksilver or letting any air into the tube, and yet nevertheless the air shall have the same liberty to operate upon it as on those common ones now in use with respect to the weight of the atmosphere\\". None of these portable barometers are known to exist, but a good example of a \\"common\\" sort made by Quare is at Hampton Court. Quare was chosen a member of the court of assistants in the Clockmakers' Company in 1697, warden in 1705 and 1707, and master of the company in 1708. Death Quare died on 21 March 1724, aged 75, at his country house at Croydon, and was buried in the Quaker burial ground, Chequer Alley, Bunhill Fields, on 27 March. The Daily Post of Thursday, 26 March, reported: \\"Last week dy'd Mr. Daniel Quare, watchmaker in Exchange Alley, who was famous both here and at foreign courts for the great improvements he made in that art, and we hear he is succeeded in his shop and trade by his partner, Mr. Horseman\\", i.e. Stephen Horseman, apprenticed to Quare in 1702, and admitted to the Clockmakers' Company in 1709.Parker, London News, 30 March 1724 His will, made on 3 May 1723, was proved on 26 March 1724 by Jeremiah, his son and executor. Among other bequests, Quare left to his wife ¬£2,800, all his household goods, both in London and in the country, and \\"the two gold watches she usually wears, one of them being a repeater and the other a plain watch\\". The widow lived with her son, Jeremiah, until her death on 4 November 1728 (aged 77) in the parish of St Dionis Backchurch, Lime Street. Of Quare's children who survived infancy there were, besides the son Jeremiah, a \\"merchant\\", three daughters: Anna, married to John Falconer; Sarah, wife of Jacob Wyan; and Elizabeth, who married, on 10 November 1715, Silvanus Bevan, \\"citizen and apothecary\\". At Elizabeth's wedding, Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, signed the register (along with seventy-two other witnesses).

It links Newburn, Walbottle and Throckley on the north side of the river with Ryton, Stella and Blaydon on the south side. The bridge is the western-most crossing of the Tyne in the county of Tyne and Wear; the next crossing upstream, Wylam Bridge, is in Northumberland.  History  This part of the river has been forded since Roman times because it is the most eastern part of the Tyne that is easily fordable. There have also been numerous ferries operated in the part of the river around Newburn. A bridge was finally built between 1892 and 1893. It was designed by Sandeman & Moncrieff of Newcastle and built by Head Wrightson of Thornaby-on-Tees. It was opened on 21 May 1893. For the first 50 or so years of its use, it was a toll bridge, until it was bought by Northumberland County Council in 1947. The toll house on the northeast side of the bridge has since been demolished. The bridge used to have two lanes crossing it up until the 1960s. It has since had single road traffic because of the weight limit of , later raised to . In 2007 the bridge was closed for a number of months for renovation and repainting. In 2018 the bridge closed and will remain closed for several months, except for footpath access.

The plant manufactured chemicals related to the production of fertilizer, initially potassium nitrate from arc-produced nitric acid and later ammonia, hydrogen, and heavy water. The location was chosen for its vicinity to hydroelectric power plants built in the M√•na river. 30 million tonnes of products, equivalent of 1.5 million wagon loads, were produced in Rjukan. After the closing parts of the plants and the railway have been preserved. History Rjukan Falls, from which the power stems =Background= The Telemark power-based industry adventure started in 1902 when Sam Eyde, along with Norwegian and Swedish investors, bought Rjukan Falls‚Äîestablishing A/S Rjukanfos on 30 April 1903. The same year, on 13 February, Eyde and Kristian Birkeland had met and started working on refining the electric arc to produce an electric flame; allowing Eyde to complete his process of converting air and electricity into fertilizer. On 19 December 1903 Det Norske Kv√¶lstofkompagni was founded, followed by Det Norske Aktieselskap for Eletrokemisk Industri (today Elkem) in 1904; both were in part owned by the Wallenberg family, Stockholms Enskilda Bank and Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas.Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 24 The test plant for the Birkeland‚ÄìEyde process in Notodden started operation on 2 May 1905 as the first in the world to produce synthetic potassium nitrate. On 2 December 1905 Norsk Hydro- Elektrisk Kv√¶lstofaktieselskab (now Norsk Hydro) was founded, and plans to start a new plant in Rjukan were initialized; moving closer to the source of power would improve efficiency and not make it possible for the newly independent Government of Norway to hinder construction of hydroelectric power by foreign investors‚Äîa major political issue at the time. Rjukanfos applied for permission to build a power line from Rjukan to Notodden, but on 18 June 1907 the Norwegian Parliament did not accept the application‚Äîdespite an offer from Eyde that the state would receive escheat after eighty years‚Äîin part because the state would have to guarantee NOK 18 million for the project.Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 24‚Äì27 =Construction= Turbines in the Vemork power station On 13 April 1907 Norsk Hydro and the German group Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik (today BASF) made an agreement for the creation of the factory at Rjukan, Rjukan Salpeterfabrik, and at the same time created Norsk Transportaktieselskap‚Äîboth companies were owned as 50/50 joint ventures. Norsk Transport received concession on 17 July 1907 to build and operate a railway for thirty years. The companies had a stock equity of NOK 34 million.Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 27‚Äì28 Construction of the plants at Rjukan would commence through two states; first at Vemork and second at S√•heim, while the town of Rjukan would be built in the middle. The initial plant would use both the Birkeland‚ÄìEyde furnace, and the Sch√∂nherr furnace; 120 were built on 6,000 square meters floorspace. On 28 September 1911 BASF sold their ownership in the Rjukan plants to Norsk Hydro, the same year the first plant opened. Accompanying the plants was housing and public facilities for the workers. Norsk Hydro employed at the most 2,500 people during construction, and many settled and took industrial jobs after the plants were finished. The main engineer for the constructions at Rjukan was Sigurd Kloumann, while the main architect was Thorvald Astrup.Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 34 =The first years= Tank cars with chemicals The first potassium nitrate was shipped out on 8 December 1911, and two years later the plants were making a profit. Production increased from 110,000 tonnes per year to 250,000 tonnes in 1915, after the plant had been expanded, and up to 345,000 tonnes in 1917. The small hamlet of Rjukan had turned into a town, and in 1920 there were 11,651 people in Tinn.Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 134‚Äì40 The 1920s were a tough time, and production decreased, but in 1929 the electric arc technology was replaced by the Haber process, with the intermediate ammonia being synthesized at Vemork and transported by rail and ferry to Her√∏ya outside Porsgrunn on the coast, where limestone easily could be shipped in, and finished fertilizer shipped out, reducing the tonnage from Tinn. The ammonia plant was established at Rjukan in 1927, following a 1925 agreement between IG Farben of Germany, who transferred the Haber patents to Norsk Hydro in exchange for a quarter ownership, and the distribution of the products through them. During the 1930s there was a global depression, and Norsk Hydro make an alliance with IG Farben and Imperial Chemical Industries; the rise of protectionism was causing problems due to Norsk Hydro only selling 5% of the produce domestically. This was followed by many lay-offs, and not until 1938 was Norsk Hydro able to make a profit again. During the 1930s other products came into production, including hydrogen and other gases, and from 1934 as the first plant in the world mass-produced heavy water, following a production plan by Leif Tronstad and Jomar Brun. =World War IIClimax= Vemork power station After the end of the war Norsk Hydro had a strong liquidity, while the Green Revolution and increased industrialization of agriculture in Europe boomed the demand for the products; from 1945 to 1955 production increased eightfold.Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 140‚Äì44 In 1957 five round trips had to be made by the new ferry MF Storegut each day, while the trains made nine round trips from Rjukan to M√¶l; each day transporting 100 wagon with 800 tonnes potassium nitrate and 400 tonnes ammonia; by 1962 723,482 tonnes produced a year.Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 142‚Äì44 =Decline= Norsk Hydro announced in 1963 a savings plan for its four plants in Norway; Chief Executive Officer Rolf √òstbye made it clear that new technology in the production of ammonia would force the closure of the plant at Rjukan, and replace it with a petroleum-based process at Her√∏ya. The \\"Rjukan situation\\", as it was named in the press,Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 150‚Äì56 became a source of conflict between the local community and Norsk Hydro; initially 250 jobs were to be moved to Her√∏ya, but in 1964 Norsk Hydro applied for permission to build a power line from Rjukan to Her√∏ya‚Äîwhat would become the death sentence for the large industry at Rjukan. Permission for the construction of the power line was granted in 1968.Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 172‚Äì74 Production of fertilizer was moved to Her√∏ya and Glomfjord, and Rjukan transferred to production of calcium ammonium nitrate in 1963 and ammonium nitrate in 1964.Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 146 During the 1960s a series of cost reductions were introduced, after major reorganizations between 1965 and 1970; the last commuter train for the workers to the plants went on 25 May 1968,Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 164‚Äì66 while on 31 May 1970 the last passenger train in connection with the ferries went on the Rjukan Line, being replaced with bus. In 1985 the department gave in and permitted the termination of passenger services with Storegut and Ammonia.Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 174‚Äì76 The plan had been producing a deficit since 1982. Norsk Hydro made an agreement with the authorities where they would create 350 new permanent jobs, create a business fund and donate NOK 60 million for the construction of a new road, Route 37, along Lake Tinn. In 1988 Norsk Hydro terminated the ammonia production, and in 1991 they also closed down the production ammonium nitrate and potassium nitrate, along with the Rjukan Line. Within a few years the number of Norsk Hydro employees in Rjukan had been reduced from 1,760 to 530 people. All the employees were either retired or moved to other areas of Norsk Hydro's enterprise.Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 176 =Heritage= In 1988 the Norwegian Industrial Workers Museum was established at Vemork; by 1995 it had become a national museum. After the closing in 1991 the railway and railway ferries were preserved. In 2004 the foundation running the heritage railway was discontinued, and in 2007 the Norwegian Industry Workers Museum was launched as the new operator by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage. This would allow the plants and Rjukan along with the railway, and equivalent closed plants at Odda to be nominated as a World Heritage Site by the directorate. Facilities SF Rjukanfoss in 1911 =Hydrogen plant= For the creation of hydrogen and oxygen, a plant was built next to Vemork. Established in 1929, it sent the products down to Rjukan via pipeline. By 1934 it was discovered that the plant was making heavy water as a byproduct; since there was a market for this amongst scientists at the time, up to were produced per day. The plant was torn down after it was disused in 1971. The hydrogen plant required direct current, that could not be transported longer distances without large energy loss; therefore it had to be located right beside the power station. =Power plants= The establishment at Rjukan allowed for the exploitation of hydroelectricity from the lake M√∏svatn through five power stations along the river M√•na, Svelgfoss I (1907), Lienfoss (1909), Vemork (1916), S√•heim (1916) and Fr√∏istul (1926). Vemork was at the time of its opening the largest in the world, and four times larger than the runner up in Norway. To allow such high falls as the newly developed pelton turbine had to be taken into use. =Transport= To transport the products to the coastal port at Skien, Norsk Hydro needed to build an extensive railway network. Cargo was stored in tank cars and transported down the Rjukan Line to M√¶l, where it was transferred to the Tinnsj√∏ railway ferry. After a ride across the lake, it was again transferred to the Tinnoset Line and transported to Notodden where it was transshipped to barges and transported down the Telemark Canal. After 1919 the final stage was replaced with the Bratsberg Line;Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 72 simultaneously the Tinnoset Line was nationalized and taken over by Norwegian State Railways.Payton and Lepper√∏d, 1995: 66 NotesBibliography * Category:Companies based in Telemark Category:Chemical companies established in 1907 Category:Tinn Category:Norsk Hydro Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1991 Category:1991 disestablishments in Norway Category:Norwegian companies established in 1907 ","title":"Norsk Hydro Rjukan"},{"id":"18079260","text":"Darsamand is one of the most beautiful village in tehsil tall, district of hangu - and union council of Hangu District in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.Tehsils & Unions in the District of Hangu - Government of Pakistan It is located at 33¬∞26'16N 70¬∞39'48E and has an altitude of 889 metres (2919 feet).Location of Darsamand - Falling Rain Genomics References Category:Union councils of Hangu District Category:Populated places in Hangu District, Pakistan ","title":"Darsamand"},{"id":"18079290","text":"TR Property Investment Trust () is a large British investment trust dedicated to investments in the property sector.

At Toldi Miklos, Ferenc Marki was also taught by the famous Maestro Alfred Geller (spelled Gellert in Hungarian). Palffy-Alpar identifies Borsody and Geller as being among the top fencing masters in the world during the post World War I era. (Palffy-Alpar 1967:21). He states \\"Geller, the master of the thrusting weapon at the same institute and a follower of the Italian school, was the author of a book with Tomanoczy in 1942 titled Vivas Kezikonyve [Fencing Handbook].\\" (Palffy-Alpar 1967:22). In 1935, Ferenc Marki achieved the rank of fencing master or \\"maestro\\" when he graduated among the very best of his class and received the diploma of Ma√Ætre d'Armes and Fencing Instructor. =Teaching as a Fencing Master in Hungary= After teaching at Toldi Miklos alongside of Maestros Borsody and Gellert until 1938, Maestro Marki entered the military and taught fencing at the Hungarian Military Academy.D√©lmagyarorsz√°g, Sport, \\"M√°rki Ferenc √©s tan√≠tv√°nyai: A szegedi v√≠v√°s aranykora.\\" Szeged, Hungary, January 21, 1992, page 8. By 1938, the threat of Germany's expansionist politics caused many Hungarians to join the military. When Germany's seizure of lands in neighboring Austria and Czechoslovakia was unopposed by cowering Allied nations, it became clear that resistance was futile. As a result of the German persecution of Jews in Hungary, in 1941 Maestro L√°szl√≥ Borsody (who had changed his name from Blum on converting to Catholicism) shot himself rather than be coerced into submission (Cohen 2002:339). Hungarian soldiers had to fight against Russia on its eastern border and Ferenc Marki was taken as a prisoner of war in one of the major battles there.D√©lmagyarorsz√°g, Sport, \\"M√°rki Ferenc √©s tan√≠tv√°nyai: A szegedi v√≠v√°s aranykora.\\" Szeged, Hungary, January 21, 1992, page 8. With the defeat of Germany at the end of World War II, Hungary came under the covert political control of its eastern neighbor, the Soviet Union. In 1945, Ferenc Marki returned to Szeged after his mother died to manage the family paprika business, and to resume his passion of teaching fencing. =Early Success in Hungary as a Fencing Master= From 1948 to 1956, Maestro Marki became a very successful fencing master. He joined the SZTK Fencing Club, and began teaching at other leading sports and military fencing clubs, and at the University of Szeged. The value of his skills in teaching championship fencers was quickly recognized by those in power. In 1953, he was invited to teach East German and Czechoslovakian fencers at the Tata Olympic Training Camp. In 1954-1955, when the Soviets launched their program to become the most dominant fencers in the world, he was asked to teach Soviet fencers at Budapest. His Soviet students in saber included Yevgeni Cherepovsky, Yakov Rylsky, and David Tyshler, who thereafter were among the first Soviet fencers to win medals at the World Championship in 1955 and in the Olympics a year later. Meanwhile, his Hungarian students were excelling and becoming fencing champions. Daniel Magay won first place saber team at the 1954 World Championship and at the 1956 Olympics, Thomas Orley won the 1954 Junior World Championship, Katalin Juh√°sz was a rising star in women's fencing who would later become an Olympic team medalist (1960 Silver medal, and 1964 Gold medal) and World Championship Gold medalist (1959, 1962, and 1967), and Jozsef Gyuricza won the 1955 World Championship Gold medal in foil by beating Olympic and World Champion Christian d'Oriola of France and who won an Olympic Bronze foil team medal in 1956.San Francisco News-Call Bulletin, 'World's Top Fencing Master to Tutor Here,\\" Saturday, January 13, 1962, page 10. In the 1955 international competition finals, the magnitude of his success became clear, at the end of a bout where Daniel Magay beat Hungary's best saber champion Rudolf K√°rp√°ti 5 to 0, when his renowned Maestro Alfred Gellert congratulated Maestro Marki by stating \\"Now, I can proudly say that I was your fencing master at one time.\\" =Exodus from Soviet Takeover of Hungary= In 1956, Hungarians began challenging their Communist Russian- controlled government. When state police massacred protesting students, Hungarian soldiers came to their defense and Russia sent in tanks and troops to seize military control of Hungary and begin purging the opposition. Many Hungarians rushed to leave the country. With Russian tanks in the streets of Szeged, Ferenc Marki with his wife and three children left their lives and home in Hungary behind in the night when they fled across the border at a time when a friend told them the border guards were away having dinner.San Francisco News-Call Bulletin, 'World's Top Fencing Master to Tutor Here,\\" Saturday, January 13, 1962, page 10. The Marki family sought refuge in neighboring Yugoslavia, where they first lived for a few months in temporary refugee camps. The exodus from Hungary caused the loss of its most talented fencing masters and fencers. At 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, the Hungarian fencing team refused to return to Communist-controlled Hungary. Richard Cohen, in his encyclopedic book \\"By the Sword: A History of Gladiators, Musketeers, Samurai, Swashbucklers, and Olympic Champions,\\" lists Maestro Marki as among the most notable emigrants as one of \\"the best coaches from the Toldi Miklos Institute\\" along with others including Gy√∂rgy Piller, Csaba Elthes (see USFA Hall of Fame), Nicholas Toth (see USFA Hall of Fame), and Julius Palffy-Alpar. (Cohen 2002:402-403). =Teaching in Italy and Brazil= The Marki family moved west into Italy, where Maestro Marki resumed teaching fencing at the esteemed Club di Scherma in Turin. In Italy, he taught Olympic medalists Giuseppe Delfino (team √©p√©e Gold in 1952 and 1960, Silver in 1956 and 1964; and individual Gold 1964), Giorgio Anglesio (team √©p√©e Gold in 1956), Alberto Pellegrino (team √©p√©e Gold in 1956 and foil and √©p√©e team Silver in 1964), Fiorenzo Marini (√©p√©e team Gold for 1960, and Silver in 1948) and Pier-Luigi Chicca (saber team Silver in 1964 and 1968; and Bronze in 1960).San Francisco News-Call Bulletin, 'World's Top Fencing Master to Tutor Here,\\" Saturday, January 13, 1962, pages 10 and 12. Again, the recognition came and he was offered the position of coach of the Italian National Team, which he turned down because he did not want to put his friend, who was already in that position, out of a job. As he came to realize that the future educational and occupational opportunities for his children were limited in Italy, he decided to accept an offer as a fencing master at newly constructed Paulistano Athletic Club in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. =Teaching Fencing in America= Maestro Marki remained in close contact with other Hungarian expatriate fencing masters and fencers, including Maestro George Piller, who was teaching at Pannonia Athletic Club in San Francisco and at U.C. Berkeley, and Olympic saber champion Daniel Magay. After Maestro George Piller died, Daniel Magay sent to Brazil for the only fencing master of equal stature who could take Piller's place as Maestro of the Pannonia Athletic Club.San Francisco News-Call Bulletin, 'World's Top Fencing Master to Tutor Here,\\" Saturday, January 13, 1962, page 10. Maestro Marki came to San Francisco in 1961, hoping to bring his family from Brazil once he established himself as a fencing master in the United States. On January 17, 1962, Maestro Marki reopened the Pannonia Athletic Club on the 5th Floor of California Hall in San Francisco. As before, Maestro Marki's reputation for excellence soon spread. By the Fall of 1963, Maestro Marki was offered a position as fencing master and instructor at Mills College, where his predecessor was Olympic Champion Helene Mayer(See USFA Hall of Fame).\\"Celebration Honors Fencing Maestro Ferenc Marki,\\" Milsl Stream, August, 1987, page 9. Every year, his fencers would do an annual Fencing Demonstration at Mills College. Maestro Marki soon became fencing master at City College of San Francisco, and San Francisco State University, as well. At Pannonia Athletic Club, Maestro Marki continued to train many skilled fencers, including Olympic fencers and U.S. Champions D√°niel Magay and Harriet King (See USFA Hall of Fame and Fencing at the 1964 Summer Olympics - Women's foil), and his Pannonia Athletic Club teams won Pacific Coast Championships in 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1979. Other well known fencers from Pannonia Athletic Club included Eleanor Turney (see USFA Hall of Fame), Tommy Angell (see Fencing at the 1964 Summer Olympics - Women's foil), and Girard Biagini. Maestro Marki's success did not go unrecognized. As a result of Maestro Marki's insistence on the highest standards of excellence and self-discipline in teaching his fencing students, the individuals and teams he coached at City College of San Francisco (including the CCSF men's team of Raymond Chiu, Alan Fong, Chiu Dea, Tat-Ming Ko, and Robert Qwan, and the CCSF women's team of Kathy Aanestad, Jean Michaelis, Barbara Scott, Connie Louie, and Dolores Hong) and San Francisco State University (including the men's team of Carl Sundholm, Byron Streitz, and David Bardoff, and the SFSU women's team of Jan Lenzini, Laura Kryworchenko, Kathy Aanestad, and Jean Michaelis) rose to the top of the Northern California Intercollegiate Fencing Association and Western Intercollegiate Fencing Conferences, yielding many first place trophies and medals by both teams and individuals, even besting the teams of his Hungarian Maestro colleagues Julius Palffy-Alpar at the University of California Berkeley, Francis Zold at USC, and Nicholas Toth (see USFA Hall of Fame) of the Air Force Academy. Teams and individuals coached by Maestro Marki won and medaled in many intercollegiate championships, including gold medal finishes in Northern California competitions in 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973, and took first place in the Western Intercollegiate Conference in 1971 and 1973. In 1987, Maestro Marki retired and, as he put it, exchanged his fencing sword for a fishing pole. A celebration was held at San Francisco State University, which over 200 of Maestro's students, family, and friends attended.\\"Celebration Honors Fencing Maestro Ferenc Marki,\\" Milsl Stream, August, 1987, page 9. Wherever Maestro Ferenc Marki went, he brought success. He was sought out by those who wanted to become the best at their game, he turned ordinary people into skilled fencing champions, he had well over a dozen Olympic Medalists and World Champions among his students, and he transformed mediocre or nonexistent fencing programs at the national, club, and collegiate levels into championship level fencing powers to be reckoned with.

The Doans were Loyalists from a Quaker family of good standing. The \\"Doan Boys\\" reached manhood at the time of the American Revolutionary War. Growing up in Plumstead, Pennsylvania, the Doans excelled athletically. The Doan gang's principal occupation was robbing Whig tax collectors and horse theft. The gang stole over 200 horses from their neighbors in Bucks County that they sold to the Red Coats in Philadelphia and Baltimore. The Friends Meeting House's cemetery in Plumsteadville is protected by a field stone wall that runs around its perimeter. Levi and Abraham Doan were buried just outside this wall because the pacifist Quakers refused to bury militants within their graveyard (a veteran of the Civil War is likewise buried outside the graveyard perimeter). The graves are adorned with their original native brownstone headstones which bear no inscriptions, following the Quaker practice at the time of their death, as well as newer headstones that identify them as outlaws. BackgroundBucks County, Pennsylvania in 1776= Bucks County, an area sympathetic to the Doan Outlaws with a large loyalist population, grew out of William Penn's \\"holy experiment\\", and was guided more by Quaker \\"inner light\\" than by the traditional \\"rights of Englishmen\\". As a result of Penn's effort to create a \\"nation of nations,\\" almost half of colonial Pennsylvania was non- English. In nearby Philadelphia, the elite Proper Philadelphians were rich, charming, tolerant, but had relinquished the role of governing the city. Philadelphia, by common agreement, was the largest, most cosmopolitan but also the most poorly governed city in the Colonies. Bucks County, when compared to Massachusetts in support for a war with England, was still \\"The Peaceable Kingdom\\". No doubt Pennsylvanians were outraged by the actions of the Crown, but they were more likely to express their discontent through resolutions than violent protests. Many Pennsylvanians remained skeptical about cutting ties with England right up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence. To illustrate this, the fighting in \\"Penn's Woods\\" started seven years after the Boston Massacre. As for the non-English Pennsylvanian, King George III, even at his worst, was better than what they had known in their homeland. Fat Pennsylvania's legendary prosperity helped ease discord. Bucks County could boast rich farmland, large supplies of fresh water, timber, iron, fire clay, game, and their famous fieldstone for building. The common New Englander by contrast had to choose between hard-scrabble farming or dangerous fishing off rock-ribbed coasts.Pennsylvania, 1776 by Robert A. Secor (Editor) PENN STATE UNIVERSITY PRESS 1976 prologuePuritan Boston and Quaker Philadelphia by E. Digby Baltzell Timeline *In the fall of 1770, Moses Doan left his home in anger after an argument with his father Joseph Sr. A few days later he saved the family of the young girl he loved from an Indian attack, but his subsequent declaration of love for her was rebuffed. Around this time he joined a small band of local Indians of the Wolf tribe. It is believed that he stayed with them for several months, hunting and engaging in feats of strength with them which he always won. *In 1774 Moses enlisted his brothers, Aaron, Levi, Mahlon, Joseph and his cousin Abraham to his gang. A handwritten note by Etta Holloway, great-granddaughter of Joseph Doan, tells the story of the outlaws this way: > They were all of the Quaker faith and did not believe in war. The new > government levied a tax upon Joseph, Sr., the father of the Tory Doan boys, > confiscated his farm, threw his wife, 3 daughters and youngest son off of > the land, jailed Joseph Sr. for non payment of taxes and branded him on his > hand as a criminal. This was the given reason for the start of the notorious > group known as the Tory Doans. However, the Pennsylvania Archives date the forfeiture of Joseph Doan's home as August 13, 1782, after the conclusion of the Revolution, and 10 months after the Doan gang robbed the treasury at Newtown. *In July 1776 Moses and Levi met with General William Howe and offered themselves as spies. Moses earned the nickname \\"Eagle Spy\\". *In July 1776, most able-bodied men marched off to war, leaving the area unprotected. *On August 27, 1776, Moses Doan informed General Howe of the unprotected Jamaica Pass and helped Howe defeat Washington at the Battle of Long Island. *On December 25, 1776, Moses may have delivered this note to Colonel Rahl's headquarters: \\"Washington is coming on you down the river, he will be here afore long. Doan\\". Colonel Rahl never read this note, and Washington kept the element of surprise. He was able to cross the Delaware River with the Continental Army and handily win the pivotal Battle of Trenton. *On 6/15/1778 Joseph Doan Sr was listed as a traitor (relisted on 11/28/1783), along with 200 other men. Aaron Doan, Mahlon Doan and Moses Doan were listed as traitors on a 7/30/1778 supplemental list.PA archives Colonial Records vol.11; series 4 v.3; and series 6 v.13 respectively *On June 7, 1780, Abraham Doan killed a woman in her home with her nine fearful children huddled around her. While this statement is listed in several sources, there is no confirmation of this event, and in fact, the woman's husband had refuted it. However, a 1788 broadside about Abraham and Levi Doan did state that a victim (a French gentleman who owned a store on the Susquehanna) did die of wounds incurred from the gang. The gang is documented in the PA archives with threatening to kill collectors. *On October 22, 1781, the Doan gang robbed the Bucks County Treasury in Newtown of 1,307 pounds sterling. This was three days after Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown on October 19. The monies were never recovered.History of Bucks County, Pennsylvania J.H. Battle 1887 Page 296 *In the next year, the Doan gang is documented to have robbed nine other collectors.Pa Archives: Series 1, v.9 *In June 1783 Moses Doan and Abraham Doan and others robbed \\"several\\" Bucks County tax collectors in their homes. A 100-pound reward was offered for their apprehension.Pa Archives: Series 4 Governor's Papers, v.3 *On July 26, 1783 Moses Doan, Abraham Doan, Levi Doan, Mahlon Doan and others robbed two Bucks county tax collectors and four Bucks citizens at night in their homes. The 100-pound reward was reiterated. *On August 28, 1783, an armed posse of 14 men was formed when word was received of the Doan gang whereabouts. Abraham and Levi Doan escaped; Moses Doan was killed while resisting arrest. One posse member, Major Kennedy, was struck in the back by a bullet from a Doan gun, and died from the injuries three days later.September 3, 1783 newspaper article in the Pennsylvania Gazette *On August 28, 1783 there was a note found in Moses Doan's pocket threatening the murder of the Speaker of the House and Patriot Muhlenberg if Joseph Doan was not released from the Philadelphia prison. *On September 14, 1783 the reward was increased to 300 pounds per outlaw. *Moses Doan's gravestone was moved by a farmer and currently lies in a hedgerow in Plumstead Township, badly weathered by the elements. *In 1783 Mahlon escaped from a Bedford, Pennsylvania jail and made his way to safety in New York City. *In 1784 Joseph Jr. escaped from a Newtown jail under sentence of death for murder. Joseph Jr. changed his name and posed as a New Jersey schoolteacher for nearly a year before his real identity was discovered. Joseph Jr. then fled to Canada.History of Bucks County, Pennsylvania J.H. Battle 1887 Page 300 *On May 17, 1787 Aaron Doan, who had been sentenced to hang for outlawry, was pardoned on the condition he leave America and never return.PA Archives; Colonial Papers, vol.15 *On September 24, 1788, Levi Doan and his cousin Abraham Doan confessed to aiding the British and were hanged in Philadelphia. Replaced headstone of Abraham Doan grave Removed image gallery. The Doan myth *Moses riding his horse off the cliffs of Fleesedale Road (today Fleecydale Rd. in Solebury Township, Pennsylvania) *Never sneak up on a Doan dead or alive.\\"Haunted Bucks County\\" *Two million dollars in buried treasure * The Doans were polarizing figures. Loyalists wrote of the Doan gang as if they were Robin Hood. Patriots referred to them as demons. No doubt their success as spies, horsemen, runners, jumpers, their bravery, and their numerous criminal exploits hardened both views. In popular culture An American historical drama television series about the Doan Outlaws, America's Original Outlaws, is currently in pre-production as of August 2019. A documentary and preview to the narrative series America's Original Outlaws wrapped on December 7, 2019.

It is performed for sexual enhancement for the benefit of both partners, aesthetics, symmetry and gratification. The labia and the whole vulva differ in size, shape, and colour from one woman to another. In that labia stretching is attempting to change this body part to fit an ideal, and that it is often done by older women to girls, it has been compared to female genital mutilation (FGM) and child abuse. Benefits, drawbacks, and medical issues Elongated labia are perceived to facilitate orgasm and female ejaculation, and are considered to enhance sexual pleasure for both partners. Women who have unequally long labia may increase the size of the shorter to achieve symmetry. They also swell inwards, partially blocking the entrance to the vagina. The practice of labia stretching itself does not cause sexually transmitted infections (including HIV). Such infections generally occur later in life through sexual activity. Some writers have asserted that there is a causal link between labia stretching and rates of infection. One review concluded: The opposite of labia stretching is labia reduction or labiaplasty, which is performed as a surgical procedure for women whose genitals cause them discomfort or pain,, \\"Intimate Operations: OB-GYN Organization Issues Warning\\", ABC News, 31 August 2007, retrieved on 22 June 2008 or for aesthetic reasons. Controversy and legality Although the World Health Organization previously included labial stretching within the context of \\"mutilation\\" (see Genital modification and mutilation), the negative context of that was not supported by the research of Marian Koster MSc and Dr. Lisa Price of Wageningen University, Netherlands. This led the WHO to schedule amending their treatment of it, perhaps as \\"modification\\" instead, in February 2008. The practice of labial stretching does not violate women's rights, in that it does not involve physical violence, unless the woman is misled as to the benefits of the practice. However, it may be contrary to African customary law and rights of women if it is in conflict with public policy. Girls usually start to stretch their labia from ages 8 to 14, before menarche. Children in the African diaspora practise this too, so it occurs within immigrant communities in, for example, Britain, where a BBC report labelled it a hidden form of child abuse The girls are subject to familial and social pressure to conform. Historic context The early recordings of the results of the practice are perhaps among the Khoisan peoples of southern Africa, where the inner labia were seen to be several centimeters longer than the outer labia. When Captain James Cook reached Cape Town in 1771, towards the end of his first voyage, he acknowledged being \\"very desirous to determine the great question among natural historians, whether the women of this country have or have not that fleshy flap or apron which has been called the Sinus pudoris\\"; eventually a physician described treating patients with labia ranging from half an inch to three or four inches. In Eastern Africa Monica Wilson recorded the custom through her fieldwork with the Nyakyusa people in the 1930s, and in Southern Africa Isaac Schapera worked with the Nama people, the largest group amongst the Khoikhoi, early in the 20th century, publishing The Khoisan Peoples of South Africa in 1930, in which he documents labia stretching. Rwanda In Rwandan culture, female family members teach girls at puberty how to pull their labia to lengthen them (gukuna, \\"pull\\", imishino \\"labia\\" in Kinyarwanda language), using local medicinal flora to ease the process. Women continue the practice into adulthood and through marriage. The most important aspect of gukuna imishino, which may begin about the age of 10, is to assist the couple to perform the sexual practice of kunyaza, in which the sexual satisfaction of the woman comes before that of the man. Uganda Some human rights activists in the country, including feminist scholar Sylvia Tamale, support labia stretching. Zambia According to a report in the Global Press Journal, labia stretching is common in Zambia, but such a social taboo that it is rarely discussed. It is defended by traditional marriage counsellors and challenged by feminist activists. South Pacific Labia modification is documented as having existed in cultures outside Africa, particularly in the South Pacific. Robert Carl Suggs wrote about it in 1966 regarding the culture of the Marquesas Islands.Robert Suggs, Marquesan Sexual Behavior [New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1966], pp. 39‚Äì42, as quoted in Paige, above. Links to other practices Scholars link labial elongation with genital tattooing. Elsdon Best wrote about the Maori (published in 1924, but apparently referring to a historical custom he had not witnessed himself): \\"Women were occasionally tattooed on the private parts, and this was a custom among Fijian women. It was alluded to as a tara whakairo.\\" Belgian missionary Gustaaf Hulstaert wrote about genital tattooing in 1938 in Le mariage des Nkund√≥, about the Mongo people of the Congo: \\"Both women and men wear tattoos, but it is more common among women. For women, it is considered more sexual and often located near the sex organs.\\"Hulstaert, Gustave E. (translated by Vizedom, Monika B.) (1938) Marriage among the Nkundu.

See Davies (1911: p. xxix) Columbus's letter on the first voyage is the first known document announcing the results of the first voyage of Christopher Columbus that set out in 1492 and reached the Americas. The letter was ostensibly written by Columbus himself, on February 15, 1493, aboard the caravel Ni√±a, while still at sea, on the return leg of his voyage.Ife, Barry W. (1992) \\"Introduction to the Letters from America\\", King's College London. . Accessed February 12, 2012. A post-script was added upon his arrival in Lisbon on March 4, 1493, and it was probably from there that Columbus dispatched two copies of his letter to the Spanish court. The letter was instrumental in spreading the news throughout Europe about Columbus's voyage. Almost immediately after Columbus's arrival in Spain, printed versions of the letter began to appear. A Spanish version of the letter (presumably addressed to Luis de Sant√°ngel), was printed in Barcelona by early April 1493, and a Latin translation (addressed to Gabriel Sanchez) was published in Rome around a month later (ca. May 1493). The Latin version was swiftly disseminated and reprinted in many other locations‚ÄîBasel, Paris, Antwerp, etc.‚Äîstill within the first year of his arrival. In his letter, Christopher Columbus claimed to have discovered and taken possession of a series of islands on the edge of the Indian Ocean in Asia‚ÄîColumbus was not aware that he had stumbled upon a new continent. He described the islands, particularly Hispaniola and Cuba, exaggerating their size and wealth, and suggested that mainland China probably lay nearby. He also gave a brief description of the native Arawaks (whom he called \\"Indians\\"), emphasizing their docility and amenability, and the prospects of their conversion to Catholicism. However, the letter also revealed local rumors about a fierce man-eating tribe of \\"monsters\\" in the area (probably Caribs), although Columbus himself disbelieved the stories, and dismissed them as a myth. The letter provides very few details of the oceanic voyage itself, and covers up the loss of the flagship of his fleet, the Santa Mar√≠a, by suggesting Columbus left it behind with some colonists, in a fort he erected at La Navidad in Hispaniola. In the letter, Columbus urges the Catholic monarchs to sponsor a second, larger expedition to the Indies, promising to bring back immense riches. A slightly different version of Columbus's letter, in manuscript form, addressed to the Catholic monarchs of Spain, was found in 1985, part of the Libro Copiador collection, and has led to some revision of the history of the Columbus letter.Zamora (1993); Henige (1994)  Background  Route of Columbus's first voyage Christopher Columbus, a Genoese captain in the service of the Crown of Castile, set out on his first voyage in August 1492 with the objective of reaching the East Indies by sailing west across the Atlantic Ocean. As is well known, instead of reaching Asia, Columbus stumbled upon the Caribbean islands of the Americas. Convinced nonetheless he had discovered the edges of Asia, Columbus set sail back to Spain on January 15, 1493, aboard the caravel Ni√±a. According to the journal of his voyage, on February 14, Columbus was caught in a storm off the Azores islands. The resulting poor condition of his ship forced him to put in at Lisbon (Portugal) on March 4, 1493. Columbus finally arrived at Palos de la Frontera in Spain eleven days later, on March 15, 1493.See Columbus's journal (Markham ed., 1893: pp. 178, 187‚Äì88, 192) During the return journey, while aboard the ship, Columbus wrote a letter reporting the results of his voyage and announcing his discovery of the \\"islands of the Indies\\". In a postscript added while he was idling in Lisbon, Columbus reports sending at least two copies of the letter to the Spanish court‚Äîone copy to the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, and a second copy to the Aragonese official Luis de Sant√°ngel, the principal supporter and financial backer of Columbus's expedition. Copies of Columbus's letter were somehow picked up by publishers, and printed editions of his letter began to appear throughout Europe within weeks of Columbus's return to Spain.Matthew Edney (1996, rev. 2009), \\"The Columbus Letter: The Diffusion of Columbus's Letter through Europe, 1493‚Äì1497\\" online at the University of Southern Maine (accessed Jan 9, 2017). A Spanish version of the letter (based on the letter he sent to Luis de Sant√°ngel) was printed in Barcelona probably in late March or early April 1493. A Latin translation of the letter (addressed to Gabriel Sanchez) was printed in Rome about a month later. Within the first year of his arrival, eight more editions of the Latin version were printed in various European cities‚Äîtwo in Basel, three in Paris, another two in Rome and another in Antwerp. Already by June 1493, the letter had been translated by a poet into Italian verse, and that version went through multiple editions in the next couple of years. A German translation appeared in 1497. The rapid dissemination of Columbus's letter was enabled by the printing press, a new invention that had established itself only recently. Columbus's letter (particularly the Latin edition) forged the initial public perception of the newly discovered lands. Indeed, until the discovery of Columbus's on-board journal, first published in the 19th century, this letter was the only known direct testimony by Columbus of his experiences on the first voyage of 1492.Henige (1994: pp. 141‚Äì42). An intact version of Columbus's on-board journal, \\"Diario de bordo\\", has yet to be found. All that is available is a heavily edited and abridged version of the journal reproduced by Bartolom√© de las Casas in his Historia de las Indias. Although written in the 16th century, Las Casas's manuscript was only discovered in the 1790s and published only in 1875‚Äì76. For a reproduction with English translation, see Dunn and Kelley (1989). It is estimated that, on the whole, between 1493 and 1500, some 3,000 copies of the Columbus letter were published, half of them in Italy, making it something of a best-seller for the times.Clough (1994: p. 299) By contrast, Columbus's 1495 letter of his second voyage and his 1505 letter of his fourth voyage had only one printing each, probably not exceeding 200 copies. Original versions of Columbus's letter, written by his hand, have never been found. Only the printed editions‚ÄîSpanish and Latin‚Äîare known. However, a third version of the letter, contained in a 16th-century manuscript collection known as the Libro Copiador, was discovered in 1985. This manuscript version differs in several significant ways from the printed editions and, although its authenticity is still tentative, many believe the Copiador version to be a closer rendition of Columbus's original missive.  Content of the letter  Columbus takes possession of the islands of the Indies, \\"with flags flying and no one objecting\\" The published Latin versions of the letter are almost all titled \\"Letter of Columbus, on the islands of India beyond the Ganges recently discovered\\". The term \\"India beyond the Ganges\\" (India extra Gangem) was the archaic term frequently used by earlier geographers (e.g., Ptolemy) to refer vaguely to Southeast Asia (roughly from Burma down to the Malay peninsula); the Indian subcontinent proper was referred to as \\"India within the Ganges\\" (India intra Gangem).Mitchell's Ancient Geography (1868: p. 55) Thus the islands of \\"India beyond the Ganges\\" claimed to have been reached would roughly correspond to modern Indonesia or thereabouts. The earlier printed Spanish edition bears no title, nor does the manuscript copy of the letter to the Catholic monarchs (Libro Copiador).The following account relies on the available online facsimile and transcriptions listed at the bottom of the article. Quick reference: printed Spanish edition of the Letter to Santangel (Barcelona ed.; Ambrosian edition; Naverrete trans.); printed Latin edition letter to Sanchez (2nd Roman (Plannck) ed.; 3rd Roman (Silber) ed.; Basel ed.); Libro Copiador letter (transcription). In the letter, Christopher Columbus does not describe the journey itself, saying only that he traveled thirty-three days and arrived at the islands of \\"the Indies\\" (las Indias), \\"all of which I took possession for our Highnesses, with proclaiming heralds and flying royal standards, and no one objecting\\". He describes the islands as being inhabited by \\"Indians\\" (Indios). In the printed letters, Columbus relates how he bestowed new names on six of the islands. Four are in the modern Bahamas: (1) Sant Salvador (for which he also gives the local name, Guanaham in the Spanish edition and Guanahanin in the Latin letter; modern English texts normally render it as Guanahani), (2) Santa Maria de Concepcion, (3) Ferrandina (Fernandinam in the Latin version, in modern texts Fernandina), and (4) la isla Bella (given as Hysabellam in the Latin version, and La Isabela in modern texts).Compare p.xv of the facsimile of the Barcelona edition of the Spanish letter; and p.ix of the second Roman edition of the Latin letter. He also names (5) La Isla Juana (Joanam in Latin, modern Cuba) and (6) the island of La Spa√±ola (Hispana in the Latin letter, modern Hispaniola). In the letter, Columbus says that he believes Juana is actually part of the continental mainland (terra firme) of Cathay (Catayo, archaic for China), even though he also admits some of the Indians he encountered informed him that Juana was an island. Later in the letter, Columbus locates the islands at the latitude of 26¬∞N, a fair bit north of their actual location (\\"es distinta de la linea equinocial veinte e seis grados\\"). (Note: in the Copiador version, Columbus makes no mention of the latitudes nor the native name Guanahanin.) The six islands of the Indies, woodcut from the 1494 Basel edition of Columbus's letter In his letter, Columbus describes how he sailed along the northern coast of Juana (Cuba) for a spell, searching for cities and rulers, but found only small villages \\"without any sort of government\\" (\\"no cosa de regimiento\\"). He notes that the natives usually fled when approached. Finding this track fruitless, he decided to double-back and head southeast, eventually sighting the large island of Hispaniola, and explored along its northern coast. Columbus exaggerates the size of these lands, claiming Juana is greater in size than Great Britain (\\"maior que Inglaterra y Escocia juntas\\") and Hispaniola larger than the Iberian peninsula (\\"en cierco tiene mas que la Espana toda\\"). In his letter, Columbus seems to attempt to present the islands of the Indies as suitable for future colonization. Columbus's descriptions of the natural habitat in his letters emphasize the rivers, woodlands, pastures, and fields \\"very suitable for planting and cultivating, for raising all sorts of livestock herds and erecting towns and farms\\" (\\"gruesas para plantar y senbrar, para criar ganados de todas suertes, para hedificios de villas e lugares\\"). He also proclaims that Hispaniola \\"abounds in many spices, and great mines of gold, and other metals\\" (\\"ay mucha especiarias y grandes minas de oros y otros metales\\"). He compares lush and well-watered Hispaniola as more favorable to settlement than mountainous Cuba. Columbus characterizes the native inhabitants of the Indies islands as primitive, innocent, without reason (\\"like beasts\\", \\"como bestias\\"), and unthreatening. He describes how they go about largely naked, that they lack iron and weapons, and are by nature fearful and timid (\\"son asi temerosos sin remedio\\"), even \\"excessively cowardly\\" (\\"en demasiado grado cobardes\\"). Hispaniola Indians offering Columbus's men piles of gold in exchange for their shoelaces (illustration from Theodor de Bry, 1594) According to Columbus, when persuaded to interact, the natives are quite generous and na√Øve, willing to exchange significant amounts of valuable gold and cotton for useless glass trinkets, broken crockery, and even shoelace tips (\\"cabos de agugetas\\"). In the printed editions (albeit not in the Copiador version) Columbus notes that he tried to prevent his own sailors from exploiting the Indians' na√Øvet√©, and that he even gave away things of value, like cloth, to the natives as gifts, in order to make them well-disposed \\"so that they might be made Christians and incline full of love and service towards Our Highnesses and all the Castilian nation\\". Columbus makes particular note that the natives lack organized religion, not even idolatry (\\"no conocian ninguna seta nin idolatria\\"). He claims the natives believed the Spaniards and their ships had \\"come down from heaven\\" (\\"que yo...venia del cielo\\"). Columbus notes that the natives of different islands seem to all speak the same language (the Arawaks of the region all spoke Ta√≠no), which he conjectures will facilitate \\"conversion to the holy religion of Christ, to which in truth, as far as I can perceive, they are very ready and favorably inclined\\". Possibly worried that his characterization might make it appear that the natives are unsuitable for useful labor, Columbus notes that the Indians are \\"not slow or unskilled, but of excellent and acute understanding\\". He also notes that the \\"women appear to work more than the men\\". Columbus lands in Hispaniola, some natives flee, others trade. Woodcut from 1494 Basel edition of Columbus's letter. Notice the depiction of the oar-driven galley in the foreground ‚Äì an early European interpretation of the Indian canoe, as per Columbus's description.The \\"Indian canoe\\" in the 1494 woodcut is actually a Venetian galley, with the Lion of Saint Mark on the awning, directly copied from an earlier 1486 woodcut by Erhard Reuwich showing the harbor of Rhodes. See Davies (1911: p. xxix). Columbus's physical descriptions are brief, noting only that the natives have straight hair and \\"nor are they black like those in Guinea\\". They go around usually naked, although sometimes they wear a small cotton loincloth. They often carry a hollow cane, which they use to both till and fight. They eat their food \\"with many spices which are far too hot\\" (\\"comen con especias muchas y muy calientes en demas√≠a\\"; in the Copiador version Columbus refers to a red hot chili pepper by its Ta√≠no name, ag√≠s). Columbus claims the Indians practice monogamy (\\"each man is content with only one wife\\"), \\"except for the rulers and kings\\" (who can have as many as twenty wives). He confesses he is uncertain if they have a notion of private property (\\"Ni he podido entender si tenian bienes proprios\\"). In a more detailed passage, Columbus describes the Indian oar-driven canoe (canoa, the first known written appearance of this word, originally from the Ta√≠no language). Columbus compares the Indian canoe to the European fusta (small galley). Towards the end of the letter, Columbus reveals that local Indians told him about the possible existence of cannibals, which he refers to as \\"monsters\\" (\\"monstruos\\"). This is a probable reference to the Caribs from the Leeward Islands, although neither the word \\"cannibal\\" nor \\"Carib\\" appears in the printed editions (however, in the Copiador letter, he claims the \\"monsters\\" come from an island called \\"Caribo\\", possibly Dominica). Columbus says the monsters are reported to be long-haired, very ferocious, and \\"eat human flesh\\" (\\"los quales comen carne humana\\"). Columbus has not seen them himself, but says that local Indians claim the monsters have many canoes, and that they sail from island to island, raiding everywhere. However, Columbus proclaims disbelief in the existence of these \\"monsters\\", or rather suggests this is likely just a local Indian myth pertaining to some distant Indian seafaring tribe who are probably not unlike themselves (\\"I regard them as of no more account than the others\\", \\"yo no los tengo en nada mas que a los otros\\"). Columbus connects the monsters story to another local legend about a tribe of female warriors, who are said to inhabit the island of \\"Matinino\\" east of Hispaniola (\\"first island of the Indies, closest to Spain\\", possibly referring to Guadeloupe). Columbus speculates that the aforesaid canoe-borne monsters are merely the \\"husbands\\" of these warrior women, who visit the island intermittently for mating.In Columbus's journal entry of January 6, 1493 (Markham ed., p.151), Columbus locates Caribo and Matinino east of Hispaniola, and even makes plans (January 16‚Äì17, pp. 162‚Äì63) to find the islands and capture some of these women-warriors. Tales of distinct female and male islands (\\"Feminina\\" and \\"Masculia\\") abound in Classical tradition, and Marco Polo (Pt. 3, Ch. 33) locates two such islands in the Indian Ocean. Columbus may have sought this island of women out precisely to confirm his location (March and Passman, 1993: pp. 300‚Äì01). Whatever the European influence on Columbus's thinking, there does seem to have been an indigenous local legend about an island of only women. Ferdinand Columbus (pp. 283ff.) relates the legend of Matinino, drawing from Friar Ramon Pane, who set it down in 1497 from oral native sources. The Caribs did live in a sexually segregated society, where men and women lived in separate housing and are reported to have even spoken different languages (Josephy, 1968: p. 266). The island of women reportedly abounds in copper, which the warrior-women forge into weapons and shields. Distribution of Arawaks, Caribs, and Guanajatabey in the West Indies, c. 1492 Lest his readers begin to get wary, Columbus rounds off with a more optimistic report, saying the local Indians of Hispaniola also told him about a very large island nearby which \\"abounds in countless gold\\" (\\"en esta ay oro sin cuenta\\"). (He doesn't give this gold island a name in the printed letters, but in the Copiador version, this island is identified and named as \\"Jamaica\\".) In the printed letters, Columbus claims to be bringing back some of the gold island's \\"bald-headed\\" inhabitants with him. Earlier in the letter, Columbus had spoken also of the land of \\"Avan\\" (\\"Faba\\" in the Copiador letter), in the western parts of Juana, where men are said to be \\"born with tails\\" (\\"donde nacan la gente con cola\\")‚Äîprobably a reference to the Guanajatabey of western Cuba. The Libro Copiador version of the letter contains more native names of islands than the printed editions.Zamora (1993: Spanish ed. p.188-89, English trans. p.196-97) For instance, in the Copiador letter, Columbus notes that island of \\"monsters\\" is called \\"Caribo\\", and explains how the warrior-women of Matinino send away their male children to be raised there.In this passage in the manuscript, the island of children seems to be written as \\"Cardo\\", which Zamora (1993: p. 188) leaves intact, suggesting Cardo is possibly a different island from Caribo; however Henige (1994) reads it as \\"Carbo\\" and a mere mistranscription of \\"Caribo\\"‚Äîi.e., the Amazons retain the girls on their island and send their sons to be raised on their husbands' island; thus the (male) Caribs are the sons of the Matinino Amazons. It also refers to an island called \\"Borinque\\" (Puerto Rico), unmentioned in the printed editions, that the natives report to lie between Hispaniola and Caribo. The Copiador letter notes Juana is called \\"Cuba\\" by the natives (\\"aqu√©llos llaman de Cuba\\"). He also gives more details about the gold island, saying it is \\"larger than Juana\\", and lying on the other side of it, \\"which they call Jamaica\\", where \\"all the people have no hair and there is gold without measure\\" (\\"que llaman Jamaica; adonde toda la gente della son si cabellos, en √©sta ay oro sin medida\\").Columbus's journal writes it as Yamaye (Markham ed, p. 151). Henige (1994: p. 153) takes the use of the spelling \\"Jamaica\\", which emerged only in the mid-16th century, as an indicator this was a modification by a later scribe in the Libro Copiador. Others take it as sign that the Libro Copiador might be a forgery. In the Copiador letter, Columbus suggests that he is bringing normal (full-haired) Indians back to Spain who have been to Jamaica, who will report more about it (rather than bringing the island's own bald-headed inhabitants, as claimed in the printed letters). Construction of the fort at La Navidad, Hispaniola, from the 1494 Basel edition of Columbus's letter Columbus also gives an account of some of his own activities in the letters. In the letter, he notes that he ordered the erection of the fort of La Navidad on the island of Hispaniola, leaving behind some Spanish colonists and traders. Columbus reports he also left behind a caravel‚Äîevidently covering up the loss of his flagship, the Santa Mar√≠a. He reports that La Navidad is located near reported gold mines, and is a well- placed entrepot for the commerce that will doubtlessly soon be opened with the Great Khan (\\"gran Can\\") on the mainland. He speaks of a local king near Navidad whom he befriended and treated him as a brother (\\"y grand amistad con el Rey de aquella tierra en tanto grado que se preciava de me lhamar e tener por hermano\\")‚Äîalmost certainly a reference to Guacanagar√≠x, cacique of Mari√©n.Zamora (1993: p. 228 n.8) In the Copiador version (but not the printed editions), Columbus alludes to the treachery of \\"one from Palos\\" (\\"uno de Palos\\"), who made off with one of the ships, evidently a complaint about Mart√≠n Alonso Pinz√≥n, the captain of the Pinta (although this portion of the Copiador manuscript is damaged and hard to read).Zamora (1993: p. 13) The Copiador version also mentions other points of personal friction not contained in the printed editions, e.g. references to the ridicule Columbus suffered in the Spanish court prior to his departure, his bowing to pressure to use large ships for ocean navigation, rather than the small caravels he preferred, which would have been more convenient for exploring. At the end of his printed letter, Columbus promises that if the Catholic Monarchs back his bid to return with a larger fleet, he will bring back a lot of gold, spices, cotton (repeatedly referenced in the letter), mastic gum, aloe, slaves, and possibly rhubarb and cinnamon (\\"of which I heard about here\\"). Columbus ends the letter urging their Majesties, the Church, and the people of Spain to give thanks to God for allowing him to find so many souls, hitherto lost, ready for conversion to Christianity and eternal salvation. He also urges them to give thanks in advance for all the temporal goods found in abundance in the Indies that shall soon be made available to Castile and the rest of Christendom. The Copiador version (but not the printed Spanish or Latin editions) also contains a somewhat bizarre detour into messianic fantasy, where Columbus suggests the monarchs should use the wealth of the Indies to finance a new crusade to conquer Jerusalem, Columbus himself offering to underwrite a large army of ten thousand cavalry and hundred thousand infantry to that end. The sign off varies between editions. The printed Spanish letter is dated aboard the caravel \\"on the Canary Islands\\" on February 15, 1493. (\\"Fecha en la caravela sobra las yslas de Canaria a xv de Febrero, ano Mil.cccclxxxxiii\\"), and signed merely \\"El Almirante\\", while the printed Latin editions are signed \\"Cristoforus Colom, oceanee classis prefectus\\" (\\"Prefect of the Ocean fleet\\"). However, it is doubtful Columbus actually signed the original letter that way. According to the Capitulations of Santa Fe negotiated prior to his departure (April 1492), Christopher Columbus was not entitled to use the title of \\"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\\" unless his voyage was successful. It would be highly presumptuous for Columbus to sign his name that way in February or March, when the original letter was drafted, before that success was confirmed by the royal court. Columbus only obtained confirmation of his title on March 30, 1493, when the Catholic monarchs, acknowledging the receipt of his letter, address Columbus for the first time as \\"our Admiral of the Ocean Sea and Vice- Roy and Governor of the islands which have been discovered in the Indies\\" (\\"nuestro Almirante del mar Oc√©ano e Visorrey y Gobernador de las Islas que se han descubierto en las Indias\\").Navarrete (1825: vol. 2, pp. 22‚Äì23) This suggests the signature in the printed editions was not in the original letter, but was an editorial choice by the copyists or printers.Jane (1930: p. 50) In the Copiador version there are passages (omitted from the printed editions) petitioning the monarchs for the honors promised him at Santa Fe, and additionally asking for a cardinalate for his son and the appointment of his friend, Pedro de Villacorta, as paymaster of the Indies. The Copiador letter signs off as \\"made in the sea of Spain on March 4, 1493\\" (\\"Fecha en la mar de Espa√±a, a quatro d√≠as de mar√ßo\\"), a stark contrast to the February 15 given in the printed versions. There is no name or signature at the end of the Copiador letter; it ends abruptly \\"En la mar\\" (\\"At sea\\"). In the printed Spanish editions (albeit not in the Latin editions nor the Copiador), there is a small postscript dated March 14, written in Lisbon, noting that the return journey took only 28 days (in contrast with the 33 days outward), but that unusual winter storms had kept him delayed for an additional 23 days. A codicil in the printed Spanish edition indicates that Columbus sent this letter to the \\"Escribano de Racion\\", and another to their Highnesses. The Latin editions contain no postscript, but end with a verse epigram added by Leonardus de Cobraria, Bishop of Monte Peloso.  History of the letter  Facsimile of the first page of the folio edition of the Spanish text of Columbus's letter to Luis de Santangel, dated February 15, 1493, and printed in Barcelona. From the original unique copy currently held by the New York Public Library. No original manuscript copy of Columbus's letter is known to exist. Historians have had to rely on clues in the printed editions, many of them published without date or location, to reconstruct the history of the letter. It is assumed that Columbus wrote the original letter in Spanish. As a result, historians tend to agree that the Barcelona edition (which has no date or publisher name, and the appearance of being hurriedly printed) was probably the first to be published, and was the closest to the original manuscript. At the end of the Barcelona edition there is a codicil stating: ::\\"Esta carta enbi√≥ Colom al Escrivano de Raci√≥n, de las Islas halladas en las Indias, contenida √° otra de sus Altezas.\\" (Trans: \\"This letter was sent by Columbus to the Escrivano de Racion. Of the islands found in the Indies. it contains (was contained in?) another (letter) for their Highnesses\\") This suggests that Columbus dispatched two letters‚Äîone to the Escrivano de Raci√≥n, Luis de Sant√°ngel, and another to the Catholic monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. In the printed version of the Spanish letter, the post- script is dated March 14, rather than March 4; this could be just a printer's error; the letter to the monarchs in the Libro Copiador gives the correct post-script date, March 4, 1493.Zamora (1993), p. 189 = Dispatch = In his summary of the on-board journal, Columbus's son, Ferdinand Columbus (corroborated by Bartolom√© de las Casas), reports that his father wrote two letters to the Catholic monarchs in the middle of a storm around the Azores on February 14, and sealed them in watertight casks, one thrown overboard, another tied to the stern, so that if the ships foundered, the letters would drift on their own to land.F. Columbus (1892: v.1, pp. 162-63); B. de las Casas (1875: v.1, p.447); Henige (1994: pp. 143‚Äì44) It is nearly impossible to suppose the letters were dispatched in this manner; the casks were probably fished back when the storm subsided, and the post-script confirms they were sent later. (It is also unlikely Columbus initiated the long letter in the middle of the storm‚Äîhe surely had more urgent matters to attend to; he probably wrote the main body of the letter in the calm period before the storm began on February 12, and hurried to finish them when the storm hit.)Jane (1930: pp. 36‚Äì37); Henige (1994: p. 144) There is some uncertainty over whether Christopher Columbus sent the letters directly from Lisbon, after docking there on March 4, 1493, or held on to them until he reached Spain, dispatching the letters only after his arrival at Palos de la Frontera on March 15, 1493. It is highly probable, albeit uncertain, that Columbus sent the letter from Lisbon to the Spanish court, probably by courier.Davidson (1997: p. 197) Columbus's journal says that upon docking in Lisbon, Bartholomew Dias (on behalf of King John II of Portugal) demanded that Columbus deliver his report to him, which Columbus strenuously refused, saying his report was for the monarchs of Spain alone.Columbus's journal (Markham ed., 1893: pp. 188‚Äì89) Columbus probably realized time was of the essence. It was common for royal and commercial agents to accost and interview returning sailors in the docks, so the Portuguese king would likely have the information he sought soon enough.Jane (1930: p. 45) Once he determined the location of the islands discovered by Columbus, John II might initiate a legal offensive or dispatch his own ships, to claim them for Portugal. So Columbus realized the Spanish court needed to be informed of the results of his voyage as soon as possible. Had Columbus decided to wait until he reached Palos to dispatch his letter, it might have been received too late for the Spanish monarchs to react and forestall any Portuguese actions. The earliest Spanish record of the news, reporting that Columbus \\"had arrived in Lisbon and found all that he went to seek\\", is contained in a letter by Luis de la Cerda y de la Vega, Duke of Medinaceli, in Madrid, dated March 19, 1493,Morison (2007: p. 375); Letter of Medinaceli is reproduced as document Num. XIV in Navarrete (1825: vol. 2 pp. 20‚Äì21). It was possibly fear of the interception of the courier from Lisbon by Portuguese agents that prompted Columbus to introduce some disinformation in his letter. For instance, Columbus claims he wrote the letter on a caravel while he was around the Canary Islands (rather than the Azores) probably in order to conceal that he had been sailing in Portuguese territorial waters. (The manuscript letter to the Monarchs writes the location as \\"Mar de Espa√±a\\".Davidson (1997: p. 200)) In the letter, Columbus also locates the islands at 26¬∞N, quite north of their actual location, probably trying to set them above the latitude line designated by the Treaty of Alc√°√ßovas of 1479 as the boundary of the exclusive dominions of the Portuguese crown (he fell a little short‚Äîthe treaty latitude was set at the Canary islands latitude, approximately 27¬∞50', which cuts around the middle of the Florida peninsula). He gives no details of his bearing, no mention of whether he sailed west, north or south, or whether the waters were shallow or deep‚ÄîColumbus's letters \\"say much and reveal nothing\\".Jane (1930: p. 44) Moreover, he is unclear about the length of the trip, claiming it took \\"thirty-three days\\" (which is roughly correct if measured from the Canaries, but it was seventy-one days since he left Spain itself; Columbus's letter leaves it ambiguous). Finally, his emphatic statement that he formally \\"took possession\\" of the islands for the Catholic monarchs, and left men (and a ship) at La Navidad, may have been emphasized to forestall any Portuguese claim. = Recipients = Luis de Sant√°ngel, recipient of Columbus's letter The explicit recipient of Columbus's Spanish letter was the Escribano de Raci√≥n‚Äîat that time, Luis de Sant√°ngel. An official position of the Crown of Aragon, the Escribano de Raci√≥n was the high accountant or comptroller of the king's household expenditures, and can be thought of as a finance minister to Ferdinand II of Aragon.The identification of Santangel is due to Navarrete (1825: vol. 1, p. 167). Navarrete notes that the equivalent position in the Crown of Castile had a different title, Contador mayor, which was at that time held by a certain Alonso de Quintanilla.Adler, Joseph (1998) \\"Christopher Columbus's Voyage of Discovery: Jewish and New Schristian Elements\\", Midstream. As found online , accessed February 12, 2012 It is unsurprising that Columbus singled Santangel out as the first recipient of the news. Santangel had been the person who made the case to, and persuaded, Queen Isabella to sponsor Columbus's voyage eight months earlier. Indeed, Santangel arranged for much of the financing to the Castilian crown (much of it from his own pocket) to enable the monarchs to sponsor it.Luis Santangel, a Jewish converso, was \\"Ferdinand's financial secretary, who advanced to Isabella the 16,000 or 17,000 ducats to enable Columbus to discover the New World, was penanced July 17, 1491. He still continued in the royal service but he must have been condemned again for, after his death, about 1500, Ferdinand kindly made over his confiscated property to his children\\". He was the cousin of another Luis de Santangel \\"who had been knighted by Juan II for services in the war with Catalonia, was beheaded and burnt\\", H.C. Lea (1906: p. 259) As Santangel had a lot riding on the results of this expedition, perhaps more than anybody else, it was perhaps natural for Columbus to address his first letter to him. Moreover, as the letter indicates, Columbus sought more financing to return with an even larger fleet to the Indies as soon as possible, so it would be useful to contact Santangel immediately, so he could set the wheels in motion for a second voyage. The story of the second copy of the letter, the one ostensibly sent to the Catholic Monarchs, has been more complicated. The \\"contain\\" verb in the codicil of the Spanish Letter to Santangel leaves ambiguous which one was contained in which. Some believe the letters to the Monarchs and to Santangel were sent separately, perhaps even on different days (March 4 and March 14 respectively)Davidson (1997: pp. 200‚Äì01) others suggest Santangel was supposed to personally deliver the letter to the monarchs (even though handling royal correspondence was outside his formal functions, Santangel's proximity to Isabella may have been a security considerationJane (1930: pp. 42ff)); still others believe it the other way around, that the letter to Santangel was submitted first to the monarchs to get royal approval before being forwarded to Santangel for ultimate publication (it would have been consistent with Santangel's office as Escribano, to oversee and pay the printers).Jane (1930: p. 45); Ramos (1986); Henige (1994: pp. 145‚Äì46) The reply of the Catholic monarchs to Columbus, dated March 30, 1493, acknowledges receipt of the letter, but clarifies nothing about how it was delivered.The monarchs response is reproduced as document Num. XV in Navarrete (1825: vol. 2, pp. 22‚Äì23) It was long believed by historians that the printed Spanish editions, although bearing no addressee except \\"Se√±or\\", was based on the copy of the letter sent by Columbus to Luis de Santangel,For a fascimile, see The Spanish letter of Columbus to Luis de Sant' Angel, Escribano de Racion of the Kingdom of Aragon, dated 15 February 1493, fascimile with M.P. Kerney trans., 1893, London: Quaritch. online but that the Latin edition printed in Rome (and subsequently Basel, Paris, etc.) was a translated version of the copy of the letter sent by Columbus to the Catholic Monarchs. The printed Spanish and Latin editions are practically identical, with only some very minor differences, most of them attributable to the printers. In particular, the Latin edition omits the postscript and codicil pertaining to the Escribano, and adds a prologue and epilogue not present in the Spanish editions, which give some clues as to its assumed provenance. The earliest Latin version (although bearing no date or printer name) states the letter was addressed to \\"Raphael Sanxis\\" (assumed to mean Gabriel Sanchez, the treasurer of the Crown of AragonFor the identification of Gabriel Sanchez as treasurer, see Navarrete (1829: v. 3, p. 76)), and has an opening salutation hailing the Catholic king Ferdinand II of Aragon (later Latin editions correct the addressee's name to \\"Gabriel Sanchez\\" and add Isabella I of Castile to the salutation).A fascimile of the second (corrected) Roman edition by Stephanus Plannck is reproduced in The Latin letter of Columbus: printed in 1493 and announcing the discovery of America. London: Quaritch. online. For an English translation of the also-corrected third Roman (Silber) edition, see R.H. Major, p. 1. The prologue notes that the translation into Latin was undertaken by the notary Leander de Cosco and completed on April 29, 1493 (\\"third of the calends of May\\"). The Latin editions also have an epilogue with an epigram lauding Ferdinand II by the Neapolitan prelate Leonardus de Corbaria, Bishop of Monte Peloso. For much of the past century, many historians have interpreted these notes to indicate that the Latin edition was a translated copy of the letter Columbus sent to the Catholic monarchs, who were holding court in Barcelona at the time. The story commonly related is that after Columbus's original Spanish letter was read out loud at court, the notary Leander de Cosco was commissioned by Ferdinand II (or his treasurer, Gabriel Sanchez) to translate it into Latin. A copy was subsequently forwarded to Naples (then part of the crown of Aragon), where Bishop Leonardus got a hold of it. The bishop subsequently carried it to Rome, probably to report its contents to Pope Alexander VI. At the time, the pope was then deep in the midst of arbitrating between the claims of the crowns of Portugal and Spain over Columbus's discoveries. The papal bull , delivering the pope's initial opinion, was issued on May 3, 1493, albeit there remained disputed details to work out (a second and third bull followed soon after).Davenport (1917: p. 56) It is possible Bishop Leander sought to use Columbus's letter to influence that process. While in Rome, Bishop Leonardus arranged for the publication of the letter by the Roman printer Stephanus Plannck, possibly with an eye to help popularize and advance the Spanish case.Such a motive is suggested by Jane (1930: p. 47) The letter's subsequent reprinting in Basel, Paris and Antwerp within a few months, seems to suggest that copies of the Roman edition went along the usual trade routes into Central Europe, probably carried by merchants interested in this news. The 1985 discovery of a manuscript copybook, known as the Libro Copiador, containing a copy of Columbus's letter addressed to the Catholic Monarchs, has led to a revision of this history.The Libro Copiador was first published in Romeu de Abreu (1989). See Zamora (1993) for a transcription and English translation. For other evaluations of this find, see Henige (1994), Davidson (1997) and Edney (1996 (2009 rev.)) The Copiador version has some very distinctive differences from the printed editions. It is now increasingly believed that the Latin edition printed in Rome is actually a translation of the letter to Santangel, and that the letter to the Monarchs was never translated nor printed. In other words, all the printed editions, Spanish and Latin, derive from the same Spanish letter to Luis de Santangel,. In this view, the reference to \\"Raphael Sanxis\\" added by the Roman printer is regarded as a simple error, probably arising from confusion or uncertainty in Italy about whom exactly was holding the office of \\"Escribano de Racion\\" of Aragon at the time, the bishop or the printer mistakenly assuming it was Gabrel Sanchez and not Luis de Santangel. But another possibility is that the Aragonese bureaucracy made a copy of Santangel's letter, and forwarded a copy to Sanchez for his information, and that this letter found its way to Italy by some channel, with or without royal permission (a fragment of an Italian translation suggests the treasurer sent a copy to his brother, Juan Sanchez, then a merchant in Florence.)De Lollis (1894); Jane (1930); more recently, see Ramos (1983, 1986). Nonetheless, some historians believe that Columbus sent three distinct letters: one the Catholic Monarchs (the manuscript copy), another to Luis de Santangel (origin of the printed Spanish editions), and a third to Gabriel Sanchez (origin of the Latin editions). In other words, that the Santangel and Sanchez letters, although practically identical, are nonetheless distinct.Jane (1930: pp. 39‚Äì40); Anzovin (2000: p. 109) However, this leave open the question of why Columbus would have sent a separate letter to Gabriel Sanchez, treasurer of Aragon, with whom he was not intimate, nor was particularly involved in the Indies enterprise, nor any more influential in court than Santangel or some other people Columbus might have addressed.Jane (1930: p. 38) suggests that, if Columbus sought to influence Ferdinand, then Juan de Coloma, Diego de Deza or even Cardinal Mendoza, would have been better suited recipients, rather than Gabriel Sanchez. The choice of Gabriel Sanchez may, however, have been at Luis de Santangel's recommendation or initiative. Gabriel Sanchez was of a family of conversos who traced their origins back to a Jew named Alazar Goluff of Saragossa, and Sanchez was married to the daughter of Santangel's cousin (also named Luis de Santangel).Uchamany (1993: p. 110) Although there is no record of Sanchez's direct involvement in the organization or financing of the fleet, his nephew, Rodrigo Sanchez, was aboard Columbus's ship as either a surgeonHoward Sachar (1994) \\"Destination: the New World\\", extract from Farewell Espana: The world of the Sephardim Remembered. New York: Knopf, as reprint ed at MyJewishLearning.com or a veedor (or fiscal inspector). Years earlier, Gabriel Sanchez's three brothers‚ÄîJuan, Alfonso and Guillen‚Äîas well as his brother-in- law, the son of Santangel's cousin (also, confusingly, named Luis de Santangel, like his father) were accused of conspiracy in the murder of the Spanish inquisitor Pedro de Arbu√©s in 1485. Juan and Alfonso escaped abroad, Guillen was tried but given the chance to repent. The Santangel brother-in- law, however, was found guilty of Judaizing and sentenced to death. Gabriel Sanchez himself was also accused, but he was soon extricated by his employer, King Ferdinand II. Perhaps not coincidentally, another of the persons implicated in the conspiracy was the uncle of Leander Cosco, the Latin translator of Columbus's letter to Sanchez, who may himself have been a relative to the Sanchez clan. Gabriel's brother Juan Sanchez set himself up in Florence as a merchant, and is known to have received a copy of Columbus's letter from Gabriel Sanchez, which commissioned to be translated into Italian (only a partial fragment survives, see below). One of Gabriel's nephews, also named Juan Sanchez, would later (1502) become the agent of the Aragon treasury in Seville and a contractor of supplies for the Hispaniola colonies.Uchamany, p. 111. These intricate familial connections between Luis de Santangel, Gabriel Sanchez, Juan Sanchez and Leander Cosco, could be a mere coincidence, but it also suggests that the dissemination process may have been centrally organized by Luis de Santangel through channels he trusted. It been suggested in recent years that the printed letter may not have been written in its entirety by the hand of Columbus, but rather was edited by a court official, probably Luis de Santangel.First suggested by Jane (1930), Ramos P√©rez (1983, 1986) is the most prominent recent proponent of this theory. See also Zamora (1993) and Henige (1994) This is reinforced by the discovery of the Libro Copiador. The text in the printed Spanish and Latin editions is much cleaner and streamlined than the roaming prose of Columbus's letter to the monarchs found in the Libro Copiador. In particular, the printed editions omit practically all of Columbus's allusions to personal friction found in the manuscript‚Äîover the choice of ships, past treatment in the royal court, or the insubordination of the \\"one from Palos\\" (Mart√≠n Alonso Pinz√≥n)‚Äîas well as Columbus's bizarre call for crusade in the Holy Land. The omission of these \\"distracting\\" points strongly suggests that there was another hand in the editing of the printed editions. And that this hand was probably a royal official, as these points could be construed as undignified or embarrassing to the crown. This suggests that the printing of the Columbus letter, if not directly undertaken by royal command, probably had royal knowledge and approval.Ramos (1983, 1986) Its intent may have been to popularize and advance the Spanish case against the Portuguese claims. As noted before, these were being intensively negotiated in the papal court throughout 1493‚Äì94. If so, it is quite possible that Luis de Santangel was precisely that royal official, that he edited the content and oversaw the printing in Spain, and it was Santangel who sent a copy of the edited letter to Gabriel Sanchez who proceeded to disseminate it to his contacts in Italy to be translated into Latin and Italian and printed there. The peculiarities of the printed editions (\\"Catalanisms\\" in the spelling, the omission of Isabella) suggest this entire editing, printing and dissemination process was handled from the outset by Aragonese officials‚Äîlike Santangel and Sanchez‚Äîrather than Castilians. The small Spanish editions (and its subsequent disappearance) would be consistent with this thesis. To influence public opinion in Europe, and particularly the Church and the Pope, a Spanish version was not nearly as useful as a Latin one, so there was no purpose of continuing to print the Spanish edition once the Latin one became available. Indeed, there was no point in reprinting the Latin editions either, once the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed in June 1494. Thus, Columbus's letter serves as an early example of the harnessing of the new printing press by the State for propaganda purposes. = Settling the claims = Cantino planisphere of 1502 shows the line of the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas. Christopher Columbus was probably correct to send the letter from Lisbon, for shortly after, King John II of Portugal indeed began to outfit a fleet to seize the discovered islands for the Kingdom of Portugal. The Portuguese king suspected (rightly, as it turns out) that the islands discovered by Columbus lay below the latitude line of the Canary Islands (approx. 27¬∞50'), the boundary set by the 1479 Treaty of Alc√°√ßovas as the area of Portuguese exclusivity (confirmed by the papal bull Aeterni regis of 1481).For the treaty of 1479 and the bull of 1481, see Davenport (1917: p.33, p. 49). Urgent reports on the Portuguese preparations were dispatched to the Spanish court by the Duke of Medina-Sidonia.The Spanish monarchs reply to the Duke of Medina-Sidonia is document XVI dated May 2, 1493, given in Navarrete (1825: vol. 2, pp. 22‚Äì23) Ferdinand II dispatched his own emissary, Lope de Herrera, to Lisbon to request the Portuguese to immediately suspend any expeditions to the west Indies until the determination of the location of those islands was settled (and if polite words failed, to threaten). Even before Herrera arrived John II had sent his own emissary, Ruy de Sande, to the Spanish court, reminding the Spanish monarchs that their sailors were not allowed to sail below Canaries latitude, and suggesting all expeditions to the west be suspended. Columbus, of course, was in the middle of preparing for his second journey. Pope Alexander VI (an Aragonese national and friend of Ferdinand II) was brought into the fray to settle the rights to the islands and determine the limits of the competing claims. His first bull on the matter, , dated May 3, 1493, was indecisive. The pope assigned the Crown of Castile \\"all lands discovered by their envoys\\" (i.e. Columbus), so long as they are not possessed by any Christian owner (which Columbus's letter confirmed). On the other hand, the Pope also safeguarded the Portuguese claims by confirming their prior treaties and bulls (\\"no right conferred on any Christian prince is hereby understood as withdrawn or to be withdrawn\\"). Thus, on his first shot, the pope effectively left the matter unsettled until the determination of the islands' actual geographic location.For a transcript and English translation of the bull of May 3, see Davenport (1917: p. 56) (Note: although most of the negotiations were masterminded by Ferdinand II of Aragon, who took a personal interest in the second voyage, the actual official claim of title on the islands belonged to his wife, Queen Isabella I of Castile. The rights, treaties and bulls pertain only to the Crown of Castile and Castilian subjects, and not to the Crown of Aragon or Aragonese subjects) Pope Alexander VI, who settled that the islands discovered by Columbus belonged to the Crown of Castile. It was apparently soon realized that the islands probably lay below the latitude boundary, as only a little while later, Pope Alexander VI issued a second bull Eximiae devotionis (officially dated also May 3, but written c. July 1493), that tried to fix this problem by stealthily suggesting the Portuguese treaty applied to \\"Africa\\", and conspicuously omitting mention of the Indies. On his third attempt, in another bull also called , written in the summer and backdated to May 4, 1493, the Pope once again confirmed the Spanish claim on the Indies more explicitly with a longitude line of demarcation granting all lands 100 leagues west of Cape Verde (not merely those discovered by \\"her envoys\\") as the exclusive dominion of the Crown of Castile (with no explicit safeguards for prior Portuguese treaties or grants).Davenport (1917) reproduces the bulls Eximiae devotionis of May 3 (July), (p. 64) and the second of May 4 (p. 71) (There is some confusion whether preceded or followed the second ; it is commonly supposed that the first (\\"May 3\\") was drafted in April and received in Spain on May 17, the second (\\"May 4\\") drafted in June, and received in Spain by July 19 (a copy was forwarded to Columbus in early August);See letter dated August 4, 1493, document LX in Naverrete (1825: vol. 2, p. 88) while (\\"May 3\\") is normally assumed written sometime in July. In official time, Eximiae precedes the second , but in actual time may have actually followed it.) It is uncertain exactly how the printed editions of the Columbus letter influenced this process. The letter reports the islands are located at 26¬∞N which falls just below the Canary latitude, so the letter worked almost in Portugal's favor, and forced the pope into the geographical contortions of confirming Spanish possession without violating prior treaties. However, the increasing strength of the bulls over the summer, when the letter's circulation was at its height, suggests the Spanish case was ultimately helped rather than hurt by the letter. Minutiae over latitude degrees paled in insignificance with the excitement of the new discoveries revealed in the letters. While the Portuguese tried to paint Columbus as merely just another Spanish interloper, little more than a smuggler, illegally trying to trade in their waters, the letters presented him as a great discoverer of new lands and new peoples. The prospect of new souls ready to be converted, emphasized in the letters, and a Spanish crown eager to undertake the expense of that effort, must have swayed more than a few opinions. Frustrated by the pope, John II decided to deal with the Spanish directly. The Portuguese envoys Pero Diaz and Ruy de Pina arrived in Barcelona in August, and requested that all expeditions be suspended until the geographical location of the islands was determined. Eager for a fait acompli, Ferdinand II played for time, hoping he could get Columbus out on his second voyage to the Indies before any suspensions were agreed to. As the king wrote Columbus (September 5, 1493), the Portuguese envoys had no clue where the islands were actually located (\\"no vienen informados de lo que es nuestro\\"Document LXXI in Navarrete (1825: vol. 2 p. 108)). On September 24, 1493, Christopher Columbus departed on his second voyage to the west Indies, with a massive new fleet. The Pope chimed in with yet another bull on the matter, Dudum siquidum, written in December but officially backdated September 26, 1493, where he went further than before, and gave Spain claim over any and all lands discovered by her envoys sailing west, in whatever hemisphere those lands happened to be.See Davenport (1917) for Dudum siquidum (p. 79) Dudum Siquidum had been issued with a second voyage in mind‚Äîshould Columbus indeed reach China or India or even Africa on this trip, the lands discovered would come under the Spanish exclusive sphere. Subsequent negotiations between the crowns of Portugal and Spain proceeded in Columbus's absence. They culminated in the Treaty of Tordesillas partitioning the globe between Spanish and Portuguese spheres of exclusivity at a longitude line 370 leagues west of Cape Verde (about 46¬∞30' W).Davenport (1917: p. 84). This treaty was not ratified by the pope until 1506, in the bull Ea Quem by Pope Julius II, Alexander's successor. See Davenport (1917: p. 107) On the day the treaty was signed, June 7, 1494, Columbus was sailing along the southern shore of Cuba, prodding fruitlessly at that lengthy coast. On June 12, Columbus gathered his crew on Evangelista island (what is now Isla de la Juventud), and had them all swear an oath, before a notary, that Cuba was not an island but indeed the mainland of Asia and that China could be reached overland from there.Winsor (1891:p. 296)  Editions of the letter  There are two known editions of the (Spanish) Letter to Santangel, and at least six editions of the (Latin) Letter to Gabriel Sanchez published in the first year (1493), plus an additional rendering of the narrative into Italian verse by Giuliano Dati (which went through five editions). Other than the Italian verse, the first foreign language translation was into German in 1497. In all, seventeen editions of the letter were published between 1493 and 1497. A manuscript copy of the letter to the Catholic monarchs, found in 1985, remained unprinted until recently. = Letter to Luis de Santangel (Spanish) = Written and printed in Spanish, usually assumed to be from the copy of the letter sent by Columbus to Luis de Sant√°ngel, the Escribano de Racion of the Crown of Aragon, although there is no addressee named (the letter is addressed merely to \\"Se√±or\\"). * 1. Barcelona edition, untitled, in folio, undated and printer unnamed. The existence of certain Catalan-influenced spellings it was from the outset presumed to be probably published in Barcelona. Some early historians assumed the printer to be Johan Rosenbach, but he has been more recently identified as probably Pere Posa of Barcelona on the basis of typographic similarity.Sanz L√≥pez (1962: p. 19) The date of the edition is estimated to be late March or early April, 1493. Only one copy from this edition has ever been found. It was discovered in 1889, in the catalog of the antiquarian dealer J. Maisonneuve in Paris, and was sold for the exorbitant price of 65,000 francs to the British collector Bernard Quaritch.Winsor (1891: p. 13); Sanz Lopez (1962: p. 18) After publishing a facsimile edition and translation in 1893, Quaritch sold the original copy to the Lenox Library, which is now part of the New York Public Library, where it remains.The Spanish letter of Columbus to Luis de Sant' Angel, Escribano de Racion of the Kingdom of Aragon, dated 15 February 1493, fascimile with M.P. Kerney trans., 1893, London: Quaritch. online * 2. Ambrosian edition, in quarto, date, printer name and location are unspecified. It is sometimes assumed that it was printed sometime after 1493 in Naples or somewhere in Italy, because of the frequent interpolation of the letters i and j (common in Italian, but not in Spanish); but others insisted it was printed in Spain;Harrisse, 1866: p. 26 a more recent analysis has suggested it was printed in Valladolid around 1497 by Pedro Giraldi and Miguel de Planes (the first Italian, the second Catalan, which may explain the interpolation).Sanz (1959: p. 194) Only one copy is known, discovered in 1856 at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan. The Ambrosian letter was originally in the possession of Baron Pietro Custodi until it was deposited, along with the rest of his papers, at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in 1852 after his death.Thatcher (1903: p. 41) After its discovery, a transcription was published in 1863, and a facsimile in 1866.The transcription of the Ambrosian letter was published by G. Daelli with a foreword by Cesare Correnti (1863: pp. 63‚Äì86), followed by an Italian translation. Daelli & Corrente erroneously presumed it was addressed to Raphael Sanxis. A fascimile was published by Gerolamo d'Adda (1866: pp. xxxv‚Äìxliii), with the correct identification of being a letter to Santangel. Neither of these editions are mentioned by any writers before the 19th century, nor have any other copies been found, which suggests they were very small printings, and that the publication of Columbus's letter may have been suppressed in Spain by royal command. The existence of the Latin letter to Gabriel Sanchez was known long before the existence of the Spanish letter to Santangel. The Latin editions do not contain the codicil about the letter being sent to the \\"Escribano de Racion\\", so there was hardly a trace of its existence before the first copy (the Ambrosian edition) was found in 1856. In retrospect, however, some hints are given earlier. Columbus's son, Ferdinand Columbus, in making an account of his own library, listed a tract with the title Lettera Enviada al Escribano de Racion a 1493: en Catalan. This may have been a reference to the Barcelona edition of Columbus's letter to Santangel.Thatcher (1903: p. 45) It is likely that Andr√©s Bern√°ldez, chaplain of Seville, may have had or seen a copy (manuscript or printed) of the Spanish letter to Santangel, and paraphrased it in his own Historia de los Reyes Cat√≥licos (written at the end of the 15th century).See the passages in Andres Bernaldez's Historia de los Reyes Cat√≥licos don Fernando y do√±a Isabel (1856 ed., vol. 1, Chapter CXVIII pp. 269‚Äì77). For an English translation of the relevant passages, see Harrisse (1865: pp. 89‚Äì115). This hypothesis was first suggested by Juan Bautista Mu√±oz (1793: p. viii) even before the first Spanish edition was found. The Spanish historian Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez de Navarrete was the first to definitively find a copy of the Spanish letter in the royal archives of Simancas and to identify Luis de Santangel as the recipient. Navarrete published a transcription of the Spanish letter in his famous 1825 Colecci√≥n,.Navarrete (1825: v. 1 pp. 167‚Äì75), It is followed by a transcription of one of the Latin editions(pp. 176‚Äì97). However, Navarrete's transcription is not based on an original 15th-century edition (which he never claimed to have seen) but rather on a hand-written copy made in 1818 by Tom√°s Gonz√°lez, an archivist at Simancas.See final note in Navarrete (v. 1, p. 176). Also Thatcher (1903: p. 42) Gonzalez's copy has since been lost, and exists now only in the Navarrete transcription. It is uncertain exactly what edition or manuscript Gonz√°lez copied (although some of the tell-tale mistakes of the Barcelona edition are repeated). The Brazilian historian Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen found another hand-written copy of the Spanish letter to Santangel among the papers of the Colegio Mayor de Cuenca in Salamanca. This copy contains a significantly different ending, \\"Fecha en la carabela, sobre la Isla de S.a Maria, 18 de Febrero de 93.\\" (\\"written on the caravel, on the island of Santa Maria, 18 February 1493\\"). The date (February 18) and the identification of the Azores island of Santa Maria (rather than the Canaries) are anomalies not normally found in other editions of the Letter to Santangel. It also lacks the Lisbon post-script and the note about it being sent to the Escriban de la Racion. The Cuenca copy also had a cover title \\"Carta del Almirante √° D. Gabriel Sanches\\". As a result, Varnhagen originally conjectured this may very well have been the original Spanish copy that was translated by Leander de Cosco into Latin, and found its way to Rome.\\"Genaro H. de Volafan\\" (F.A. de Varhagen), editor, 1858, Primera Ep√≠stola del Almirante Don Crist√≥bal Col√≥n dando cuenta de su gran descubrimiento √° D. Gabriel S√°nchez, Tesorero de Arag√≥n. Valencia: Garin. online (accompanied bilingually by the Latin translation of Silber) However, modern historians believe this is in fact a later copy of the Barcelona or Ambrosian editions, and that the anomalies exist because the copyist endeavored to correct mistakes and errors in the Spanish letter in light of the later editions and published histories of the Indies by Peter Martyr, Ferdinand Columbus, etc.Jane (1930: p. 35 n.) The original Cuenca manuscript used by Varnhagen has since disappeared. It is generally accepted that the Barcelona edition is prior to the Ambrosian one. The Barcelona edition is replete with small errors (e.g., \\"veinte\\" instead of \\"xxxiii\\" days) and Catalan-style spellings (which Columbus would not have used), suggesting it was carelessly copied and hurriedly printed. The Ambrosian edition seems to correct most of these mistakes, although it also makes a few new mistakes of its own. Navarrete's transcription makes some of the same mistakes as the Barcelona edition (e.g. veinte instead of xxxiii), but most of the spellings are in proper Castilian, although it is uncertain how much of this was in the original, and how much was massaged by Gonzalez or Navarrete in their transcriptions. While all the Spanish editions are very close to each other, historians believe they are not merely corrected reprints of each other, but that all derive independently (or at least in consultation with) an unknown prior edition or manuscript. Because of the \\"Almirante\\" signature and other clues, it is believed that all the Spanish editions are probably indirect, that is, that they were probably not directly copied from Columbus's original manuscript letter, but are themselves copies of earlier unknown copies or editions.De Lollis (1894: pp. xxvi ff.); Jane (1930: p. 34‚Äì35) The simplicity and rarity of the original printed editions of the Letter to Santangel (only two copies are known to exist) has made it appealing to forgers, and there have been repeated attempts to sell fake copies of the letter to libraries and collectors. In one famous case, an Italian forger attempted to sell a copy to the New York Public Library. When the librarians refused to buy it, the forger angrily tore up the volume in front of them and stormed out. The librarians fished the pieces out of the wastepaper basket and put it back together; it is currently held as a curiosity by the New York Public Library.Thatcher (1903: pp. 41‚Äì42) = Letter to Gabriel Sanchez (Latin) = The first printed edition of the Latin translation of Columbus's letter was probably printed in Rome by the printer Stephen Plannck, ca. May 1493. Most other early Latin editions are reprints of that edition. The title is given as De Insulis Indiae supra Gangem nuper inventis (\\"Of the islands of India beyond the Ganges, recently discovered\\"), and contains a prologue noting that it was sent by Christopher Columbus to \\"Raphael Sanxis\\" (later editions correct it to \\"Gabriel Sanchez\\"), the treasurer of the Crown of Aragon.See Navarrete (1829: v. 3, p. 76) Its opening salutation hails the Catholic monarch Ferdinand II of Aragon (later editions also add mention of Isabella I of Castile) and identifies the translator as the notary \\"Aliander de Cosco\\" (later editions correct it to \\"Leander de Cosco\\"), noting that he finished translating it on April 29, 1493 (\\"third calends of May\\"). In full, the opening of the first Roman edition reads:As given in Sabin (1871: p. q274)Image of King Ferdinand II of Aragon, on the cover the Latin edition of Columbus's letter, published in Basel in July, 1494 (second Basel ed.) :: Epistola Christofori Colom: cui (a)etas nostra multum debet: de Insulis Indi(a)e supra Gangem nuper inventis, ad quas perquirendas, octavo antea mense, auspicijs et (a)ere invictissimi Fernandi Hispaniarum Regis missus fuerat: ad Magnificum d(omi)n(u)m Raphaelem Sanxis: eiusdem serenissi Regis Thesaurarium missa: quam nobilis ac litteratus vir Aliander de Cosco ab Hispano ideomate in latinum convertit: tertio kal(enda)s Maii, M.cccc.xciii, Pontificatus Alexandri Sexti, Anno primo. :: (\\"Letter of Christopher Columbus, to whom our age is much indebted, about the islands of India beyond the Ganges recently discovered, and to explore which he had been sent eight months before under the auspices and at the expense of the most invincible Ferdinand, King of Spain; to the magnificent lord Raphael Sanxis, Treasurer to the Most Serene King, which the noble and literate notary Aliander de Cosco converted from the Spanish language into Latin, third calends of May, 1493, during the first year of the pontificate of Alexander VI.\\") The corrections (Ferdinand & Isabella, Gabriel Sanchez, Leander de Cosco) were undertaken in the Second and Third Roman editions later that same year, possibly as a result of complaints by Castilian emissaries in Rome who felt their Queen (and spellings) were given short-shrift by the Aragonese.For the corrected second Roman edition, see Quaritch (1893: p. ix) All the Latin editions omit the endings found in the Spanish edition to Santangel‚Äîi.e., they omit the sign-off of being written on board ship in the Canaries, the postscript about the storm and days it took to return and the codicil about the letter being sent to the Escribano de Racion and the Catholic monarchs. Instead, it simply signs off \\"Lisbon, the day before the Ides of March\\" (\\"Ulisbone, pridie Idus Martii\\", that is, on May 14). Columbus's signature is given as \\"Christoforus Colom Oceanice classis Pr√¶fectus\\" (\\"Christopher Columbus, Prefect (or Admiral) of the Ocean fleet\\").Quaritch (1893: p. xv At the end, there is a verse epigram in honor of Ferdinand II written by Leonardus de Corbaria, Bishop of Monte Peloso.The epigram by R.L. de Corbaria, Episcopi Montispalussi\\" reads (Quaritch, p. xvi): ::\\"Jam nulla Hispanis tellus addenda triumphis, ::Atque parum tantis viribus orbis erat: ::Nunc longe eois Regiis deprehensa sub undis ::Auctura est titulus, Betice magne, tuos. ::Unde repertori merito referenda Columbo ::Gratia: sed summo est major habenda Deo, ::Qui vicenda parat nova regna tibique sibique ::Teque simul fortem praestat et esse plum. For a long time, historians believed the Latin edition was based on the copy of the letter sent by Columbus to the Catholic monarchs (as mentioned at the end of the Spanish letter to Santangel), and that Columbus's address to the treasurer Gabriel Sanchez was merely a courtly formality. According to this account, Columbus's original letter was read (in Spanish) before the monarchs then holding court in Barcelona, and then Ferdinand II of Aragon (or his treasurer Gabriel Sanchez) ordered it translated into Latin by the notary Leander de Cosco, who completed the translation by April 29, 1493 (as noted in the prologue). The manuscript was subsequently carried (or received) by the Neapolitan prelate Leonardus de Corbaria, Bishop of Monte Peloso, who took it to Rome and arranged for its printing there with Stephanus Plannck, ca. May 1493. The Roman edition was subsequently carried into Central Europe and reprinted in Basel (twice, 1493 and 1494), Paris (three times in 1493) and Antwerp (once, 1493). A corrected Roman edition was printed by two different publishers in late 1493‚Äîone by Stephen Plannck again, the other by Frank Silber (known as Argenteus).A transcription of the prologues of the various known Latin editions can be found in H. Harrisse (1866: pp. 1, 16), although he orders them differently. See also J. Sabin (1871: pp. 274‚Äì78). For a more recent breakdown of the various known editions, see M.H. Edney (1996, rev.2009: online). * 3. First Roman edition, De insulis indiae supra Gangem nuper inventis, undated and unnamed, but assumed printed by Stephanus Plannck in Rome (on basis of typographical similarity) probably May 1493. Plain text, bereft of the ornaments or stamps typical of the time, it has the appearance of being hurriedly printed, and was probably the first of the Latin editions.Harrisse (1866: p. 10) Opening salutation hails only Ferdinand II of Aragon (\\"invitissimi Fernandi Hispaniarum Regis\\"), conspicuously neglecting Isabella I of Castile; it refers to addressee as \\"Raphael Sanxis\\" (wrong first name, surname spelled in Catalan), and to the translator as \\"Aliander de Cosco\\". It was published in quarto, four leaves (34 lines per page). * 4. First Basel edition, De Insulis inventis. It is the only early edition missing the phrase \\"Indie supra Gangem\\" in the title, substituting instead \\"Insulis in mari Indico\\" (\\"islands in the Indian Sea\\"). Otherwise, it seems to be a reprint of the first Roman edition (hails only Ferdinand II, spells Raphael Sanxis, Aliander de Cosco). It is the first edition with illustrative woodcuts ‚Äì eight of them.The eight woodcuts are 1. coat of arms of Castile-Leon, 2. a vessel with the words \\"Oceanica classis\\", 3. landing on \\"Insula hyspana\\" with galley/canoe in foreground; 4. sort of map with islands named; 5. a repetition of \\"Oceanica classis\\" woodcut. 6. fort of La Navidad being constructed, finally on the tenth page (missing in some copies) 7. a full-length portrait of Ferdinand of Aragon, over the shields of Castile-Leon and Granada and (in recto) 8. coat of armas of Granada. (Henry Harrisse, 1866: p. 16). Some of the woodcuts are reproduced in the 1494 edition. Two of the woodcuts (\\"Oceana Classis\\" and the Indian canoe/galley) were plagiarized from earlier woodcuts for a different book.See Davies (1911: p. xxix). Erhard Reuwich did the engravings for a 1486 edition of Bernard of Breydenbach's Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam, published in Mainz. The \\"Oceana Classis\\" image is copied from a woodcut showing the harbor of Modone, while the indian canoe/galley is copied from the harbor of Rhodes. This edition is undated, without printer name nor location given, but it is often assumed to have been printed in Basel largely because a later edition (1494) printed in that city used the same woodcuts. Some have speculated the printer of this edition to have been Johannes BesickenHarrisse (1866: p.9, p. 13). or Bergmann de Olpe.Clough, 1994: p. 301) It was published in octavo, ten leaves (27 lines per page). * 5. First Paris edition, Epistola de insulis repertis de novo, directly from the first Roman edition (hails only Ferdinand II, Raphael Sanxis, Aliander de Cosco). Title page has woodcut of angel appearing unto shepherds. Undated and printer unnamed, but location given as \\"Impressa parisius in campo gaillardi\\" (Champ-Gaillard in Paris, France). The printer is unnamed, but a later reprint that same year identifies him as Guyot Marchant. In quarto, four leaves (39 lines per page). * 6. Second Paris edition, Epistola de insulis de novo repertis probably by Guyot Marchant of Paris. Straight reprint of first Paris edition. * 7. Third Paris edition, Epistola de insulis noviter repertis. Reprint of prior Paris edition, but this one has large printer's device on the back of the title page, identifying Guyot Marchant as the printer (ergo the deduction that the two prior editions were also by him).The Marchant colophon is reproduced in Harrisse (1866): p. 22 * 8. Antwerp edition, De insulis indi(a)e supra Gangem nuper inve(n)tis by Thierry Martins in Antwerp, 1493, directly from first Roman edition. * 9. Second Roman edition, De insulis indi(a)e supra Gangem nuper inve(n)tis, undated and printer unnamed, assumed to be again by Stephen Plannck in Rome because of typographic similarity (identical to first edition). This is a corrected edition, presumably put out in late 1493; the salutation now refers to both Ferdinand and Isabella (\\"invictissimorum Fernandi et Helisabet Hispaniarum Regum\\"), addressee's name given as \\"Gabriel Sanchis\\" (correct first name, surname now in half-Catalan, half-Castilian spelling) and the translator as \\"Leander de Cosco\\" (rather than Aliander). It is published in quarto, four leaves (33 lines per page).A fascimile of the second Roman (Plannck) edition is reproduced in The Latin letter of Columbus: printed in 1493 and announcing the discovery of America. London: Quaritch. online. * 10. Third Roman edition, De insulis indi(a)e supra Gangem nuper inve(n)tis by the Roman printer Franck Silber (who was known as \\"Eucharius Argenteus\\"). It is the first edition to be explicitly dated and inscribed with the printer's name: the colophon reads \\"Impressit Rome Eucharius Argenteus Anno dni M.cccc.xciij\\". It is also a corrected edition: it refers to addressee as \\"Gabriel Sanches\\" (Castilian name), the translator as \\"Leander de Cosco\\" and salutes both Ferdinand & Isabella. It is uncertain whether this Silber edition precedes or follows Plannck's second edition.Harrisse (1866: p. 14) assumes Silber precedes Plannck's corrected edition. It is published in three unnumbered leaves, one blank (40 lines to the page).For a Latin transcription (with English translation) of the third Roman (Silber) edition, see R.H. Major, p. 1. * 11. Second Basel edition, De insulis nuper in mar Indico repertis, dated and named, printed by Johann Bergmann in Basel, 21 April 1494. This is a reprint of the first Basel edition (uses four of the six woodcuts). This edition was published as an appendix to a prose drama, Historia Baetica by Carolus Verardus, a play about the 1492 conquest of Granada.M. Edney (1996, 2009) \\"The Columbus Letter: Concerning the Islands Recently Discovered in the Indian Sea\\", at the University of Southern Maine, reproduces the fascimile, Latin transcription and English translation, of the 1494 second Basel edition. = Italian verse and German translations = Woodcut on the title page of the Italian verse edition by Giuliano Dati, published in Florence, October 1493 (second ed.). The Latin letter to Gabriel Sanchez, either the first or second Roman editions, was translated into Italian ottava rima by Giuliano Dati, a popular poet of the time, at the request of Giovanni Filippo dal Legname, secretary to Ferdinand II.On Giuliano Dati, see Harrisse (1866: p. 28) The first edition of the Italian verse edition was published in June 1493, and went quickly through an additional four editions, suggesting this was probably the most popular form of the Columbus letter known at least to the Italian public. A translation of the Latin letter into German prose was undertaken in 1497. * 12. First Italian verse edition, , First edition of the Italian verse version by Giuliano Dati, published by Eucharius Silber in Rome, and explicitly dated 15 June 1493. * 13. Second Italian verse edition, , revised verse translation by Giuliano Dati, printed in Florence by Laurentius de Morganius and Johann Petri, dated 26 October 1493.For a copy of the Dati verse, see R.H. Major, (1848: p. lxxiii) It has a famous woodcut on its title page, which was later re-used for a 1505 edition of Amerigo Vespucci's Letter to Soderini.For a fascimile of the 1505 edition of Vespucci's letter to Soderini published by Pacini, see B. Quaritch, First Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci (1893: p. 11) * 14. Third Italian verse edition, , reprint of Dati verse edition. Undated and printing location unknown. * 15. Fourth Italian verse edition, , reprint of Dati verse, by Morganius and Petri in Florence, dated 26 October 1495. * 16. Fifth Italian verse edition, , reprint of Dati verse, undated and unnamed (post-1495), lacks title woodcut. * 17. German translation, , translated into German in Strassburg, printed by Bartholomeus Kistler, dated 30 September 1497. = Italian translation fragments = There are three manuscripts of incomplete attempts by Italian authors to translate the narrative Spanish (or perhaps Latin) letter into Italian prose, probably within 1493. The three fragments were first published by Cesare de Lollis in the Raccolta Colombiana of 1894.Cesare de Lollis (1894), editor, Scritti di Cristoforo Colombo vol. 1, part 1, of Raccolta Colombiana 1894. First fragment is on pp. lxviiii‚Äìlx, second is pp. lxx‚Äìlxxii, third is p. lxxiiii. See Jane (1930). * 18. First Italian fragment manuscript translation into Italian, held at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan. The Italian translator's note claims this to be a copy of a letter written by Columbus \\"to certain counsellors\\" (\\"ad certi consieri\\") in Spain, and forwarded by \\"the treasurer\\" (i.e. Gabriel Sanchez) to his brother, \\"Juan Sanchez\\" (named in the text), a merchant in Florence. * 19. Second Italian fragment manuscript fragment held at the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence. The Italian translator simply notes that it is a copy of the \\"letter that came from Spain\\" (\\"copia della letera venuta di Spagna\\"). There is a close connection between this Florentine fragment and the first Latin edition, suggesting one is derived from the other, or they were both using the same Spanish document.Jane (1930: p. 35) * 20. Third Italian fragment manuscript fragment held also by the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence. It contains no translator's notes about its origin or provenance. It might be worth noting here that the first known French translation appeared in Lyon in 1559, in a volume by Charles Fontaine.Charles Fontaine (1559) La Description des terres trouv√©es de nostre temps, avec le sommaire de plusieurs belles antiquitez, contenant une partie de l'excellence magnificence des richesses, triomphes et largesses des anciens, Lyon: Benoit Rigaud. See Harrisse (1866: p. 55). The first known English translation appeared in the Edinburgh Review in 1816.Edinburgh Review, December 1816, pp. 505‚Äì11. Apparently based on the Basel edition. = Letter to the Catholic monarchs (Libro Copiador) = The existence of this manuscript letter was unknown until it was discovered in 1985. The manuscript letter was found as part of a collection known as the Libro Copiador, a book containing manuscript copies of nine letters written by Columbus to the Catholic monarchs, with dates ranging from March 4, 1493 to October 15, 1495, copied by the hand of a writer in the late 16th century. Seven of these nine letters were previously unknown. Its discovery was announced in 1985 by an antiquarian book dealer in Tarragona. It was acquired in 1987 by the Spanish government and is currently deposited at the Archivo General de Indias in Seville.Arran M√°rquez (2006: p. 44); Diaz- Trechuelo (2006: p. 47) A facsimile edition was published in Rumeu de Armas (1989). A transcription and English translation can be found in Zamora (1993).Margarita Zamora (1993) Reading Columbus, Berkeley: University of California press. Available online at UC Press E-Books collection: transcription and English translation (accessed February 12, 2012). Although scholars have tentatively embraced the Libro Copiador as probably authentic, it is still in the early stages of careful and critical scrutiny, and should be treated a bit cautiously.Zamora (1993), Henige (1994) The first letter in the copybook purports to be a copy of the original letter sent by Christopher Columbus to the Catholic Monarchs from Lisbon announcing the discovery. If authentic, it is prior to the Barcelona edition, indeed it precedes all known versions of the letter.Davidson (1997: p. 197) It contains significant differences from both the Spanish letter to Santangel and the Latin letter to Sanchez‚Äînotably more details about Indian reports, including previously- unmentioned native names of islands (specifically: \\"Cuba\\", \\"Jamaica\\", \\"Boriquen\\" and \\"Caribo\\"), and a strange proposal to use the revenues from the Indies to launch a crusade to conquer Jerusalem. It omits some of the more economic-oriented details of the printed editions. If authentic, this letter practically solves the \\"Sanchez problem\\": it confirms that the Latin letter to Gabriel Sanchez is not a translation of the letter that the Spanish codicil said Columbus sent to the Monarchs, and strongly suggests that the Sanchez letter is just a Latin translation of the letter Columbus sent to Luis de Santangel. Thefts, forgeries and return of books Many of the copies were cloned via forgery from stolen copies from various libraries, including the Vatican Library. These were sold to collectors and other libraries, who were innocently duped by the fraud. The Vatican‚Äôs copy was returned in January 2020. The forgeries and thefts were the subject of intense international investigations and forensic reports. Other suspected thefts, forgeries and sales are still being examined.

LaValle (born 1968 in St. Louis, Missouri) is an American computer scientist, and a professor in the Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at the University of Oulu. He was also an early founder and head scientist of Oculus VR until it was acquired by Facebook in 2014. He is best known for his work on RRTs, the Oculus Rift, and his book, Planning Algorithms, Available online at http://lavalle.pl/planning/ one of the most highly cited texts in the field. Academic career LaValle received his BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1990, 1993, and 1995, respectively. From 1995 to 1997, he was a post-doctoral researcher and lecturer in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. From 1997 to 2001, he was an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University. From 2001-2018 he was on the faculty in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as a full professor. Since 2018, he has been a professor at the University of Oulu in Finland. He has published over 150 articles, in which most of his earlier works were in the area of robot motion planning. In addition to introducing RRTs, he coined the term \\"sampling-based motion planning\\" and developed numerous planning algorithms for handling typical control-theoretic problems such as kinematic constraints, momentum, feedback, multiobjective optimality, and stochastic uncertainty. His more recent research has focused on understanding the minimal information requirements for robot systems, leading to simpler sensor fusion methods and mathematical models that help to reduce complexity of robots (informally, their brain size) that are designed for particular taskshttp://lavalle.pl/research.html. He has published three textbooks, all of which are freely available online. In addition to \\"Planning Algorithms\\", mentioned above, he wrote books titled Sensing and Filtering. Available online at http://lavalle.pl/papers/Lav11.pdf and Virtual Reality. Available online at http://vr.cs.uiuc.edu/ Oculus VR During a leave of absence from the University of Illinois, LaValle started working from Oulu, Finland for Oculus VR in September 2012, a few days after their Kickstarter campaign. He served as their principal scientist from March 2013 until the company was acquired by Facebook in July 2014, addressing virtual reality challenges \\"including sensor fusion, magnetic drift correction, and kinematic modeling\\" while disseminating the company's technical achievements in a science blog. He developed head tracking methods for the core software, based on IMUs and computer vision, and led a team of perceptual psychologists to provide principled approaches to virtual reality system calibration and the design of comfortable user experiences. He was a coauthor of the first Oculus SDK Overview. He is a co-inventor on two Oculus VR patents. One (with Peter Giokaris) is for perception based predictive tracking for the Oculus Rift, which was crucial in reducing perceived tracking latency. The other is for sensor calibration and filtering methods, which were important for highly accurate, low-latency tracking. Other industry Since 2014, LaValle has been an active angel investor and adviser to startup companies and venture capitalists, in the areas of virtual and augmented reality, and robotics. From 2016-2017, he was a Vice President and the Chief Scientist of VR/AR/MR at Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.

That is, it is the path traced by a point attached to a circle as the circle rolls without slipping along a fixed circle. The term encompasses both epitrochoid and hypotrochoid. The center of this curve is defined to be the center of the fixed circle. Alternatively, a centered trochoid can be defined as the path traced by the sum of two vectors, each moving at a uniform speed in a circle. Specifically, a centered trochoid is a curve that can be parameterized in the complex plane by : z = r_1 e^{i \\\\omega_1 t} + r_2 e^{i \\\\omega_2 t},\\\\, or in the Cartesian plane by : x = r_1 \\\\cos(\\\\omega_1 t) + r_2 \\\\cos(\\\\omega_2 t), :y = r_1 \\\\sin(\\\\omega_1 t) + r_2 \\\\sin(\\\\omega_2 t),\\\\, where : r_1, r_2, \\\\omega_1, \\\\omega_2 e 0, \\\\quad \\\\omega_1 e \\\\omega_2.\\\\, If \\\\omega_1/\\\\omega_2 is rational then the curve is closed and algebraic. Otherwise the curve winds around the origin an infinite number of times, and is dense in the annulus with outer radius r_1 + r_2 and inner radius r_1 - r_2. Terminology Most authors use epitrochoid to mean a roulette of a circle rolling around the outside of another circle, hypotrochoid to mean a roulette of a circle rolling around the inside of another circle, and trochoid to mean a roulette of a circle rolling along a line. However, some authors (for example following F. Morley) use \\"trochoid\\" to mean a roulette of a circle rolling along another circle, though this is inconsistent with the more common terminology. The term Centered trochoid as adopted by combines epitrochoid and hypotrochoid into a single concept to streamline mathematical exposition and remains consistent with the existing standard. The term Trochoidal curve describes epitrochoids, hypotrochoids, and trochoids (see ). A trochoidal curve can be defined as the path traced by the sum of two vectors, each moving at a uniform speed in a circle or in a straight line (but not both moving in a line). In the parametric equations given above, the curve is an epitrochoid if \\\\omega_1 and \\\\omega_2 have the same sign, and a hypotrochoid if they have opposite signs. Dual generation Let a circle of radius b be rolled on a circle of radius a, and a point p is attached to the rolling circle. The fixed curve can be parameterized as f(t) = ae^{it} and the rolling curve can be parameterized as either r(t) = be^{i(a/b)t} or r(t) = -be^{-i(a/b)t} depending on whether the parameterization traverses the circle in the same direction or in the opposite direction as the parameterization of the fixed curve. In either case we may use r(t) = ce^{i(a/c)t} where c = b. Let p be attached to the rolling circle at d. Then, applying the formula for the roulette, the point traces out a curve given by: :\\\\begin{align} f(t) + (d-r(t)){f'(t)\\\\over r'(t)} & = ae^{it} + (d-ce^{i(a/c)t}){aie^{it}\\\\over aie^{i(a/c)t}}  & = (a-c)e^{it} + de^{i(1-a/c)t}. \\\\end{align} This is the parameterization given above with r_1 = a-c, r_2 = d, \\\\omega_1 = 1, \\\\omega_2 = 1-a/c. Conversely, given r_1, r_2, \\\\omega_1, and \\\\omega_2, the curve r_1 e^{i\\\\omega_1 t} + r_2 e^{i\\\\omega_2 t} can be reparameterized as r_1 e^{it} + r_2 e^{i(\\\\omega_2 / \\\\omega_1) t} and the equations r_1 = a-c, r_2 = d, \\\\omega_2 /\\\\omega_1 = 1-a/c can be solved for a, c and d to get a = r_1(1-\\\\omega_1/\\\\omega_2),\\\\ c = -r_1{\\\\omega_1/\\\\omega_2},\\\\ d = r_2. The curve r_1 e^{i\\\\omega_1 t} + r_2 e^{i\\\\omega_2 t} remains the same if the indexes 1 and 2 are reversed but the resulting values of a, c and d, in general, do not. This produces the Dual generation theorem which states that, with the exception of the special case discussed below, any centered trochoid can be generated in two essentially different ways as the roulette of a circle rolling on another circle. ExamplesCardioid= The cardioid is parameterized by 2e^{it} - e^{2it}. Take r_1 = 2, r_2 = -1, \\\\omega_1 = 1, \\\\omega_2 = 2 to get a=2(1-1/2) = 1, c = -2(1/2) = -1, d = -1. The circles both have radius 1 and, since c < 0, the rolling circle is rolling around the outside of the fixed circle. The point p is 1 unit from the center of the rolling so it lies on its circumference. This is the usual definition of the cardioid. We may also parameterize the curve as \\\\- e^{2it} + 2e^{it}, so we may also take r_1 = -1, r_2 = 2, \\\\omega_1 = 2, \\\\omega_2 = 1 to get a = -1(1-2) = 1, b = -(-1)(2)=2, d = 2. In this case the fixed circle has radius 1, the rolling circle has radius 2, and, since c > 0, the rolling circle revolves around the fixed circle in the fashion of a hula hoop. This produces an essentially different definition of the same curve. =Ellipse= If \\\\omega_1 = -\\\\omega_2 then we obtain the parametric curve r_1 e^{it} + r_2 e^{-it}, or x = (r_1+r_2)\\\\cos t, y = (r_1-r_2)\\\\sin t\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. If r_1 eq r_2, this is the equation of an ellipse with axes 2r_1+r_2 and 2r_1-r_2. Evaluating a, c, and d as before; either a = 2r_1, c = r_1, d = r_2\\\\,\\\\\\\\! or a = 2r_2, c = r_2, d = r_1\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. This gives two different ways of generating an ellipse, both of which involve a circle rolling inside a circle with twice the diameter. =Straight line= If additionally, next to \\\\omega_1 = -\\\\omega_2, r_1=r_2=r, then a = 2r, b = r, c = r\\\\,\\\\\\\\! in both cases and the two ways of generating the curve are the same. In this case the curve is simply x = 2r\\\\cos t, y = 0\\\\,\\\\\\\\! or a segment of the x-axis. Likewise, if r_1=r, r_2=-r\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, then a = 2r, c = r, d = -r\\\\,\\\\\\\\! or a = -2r, c = -r, d = r\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. The circle is symmetric about the origin, so both of these give the same pair of circles. In this case the curve is simply x = 0, y = 2r\\\\sin t\\\\,\\\\\\\\!: a segment of the y-axis. So the case \\\\omega_1 = -\\\\omega_2,\\\\ r_1 = r_2 is an exception (in fact the only exception) to the dual generation theorem stated above. This degenerate case, in which the curve is a straight-line segment, underlies the Tusi-couple.

Three years later, the American Psychological Association (APA) and NIOSH jointly organized the first international Work, Stress, and Health conference in Washington, DC. The conference has since become a biannual OHP meeting.Barling, J., & Griffiths, A. (2011). A history of occupational health psychology. In J.C. Quick & L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), Handbook of occupational health psychology (2nd ed., pp. 21‚Äì34). Washington, D.C., American Psychological Association. In 1996, the first issue of the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology was published by APA. That same year, the International Commission on Occupational Health created the Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors (ICOH-WOPS) scientific committee,International Commission on Occupational Health-Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors International Commission on Occupational Health which focused primarily on OHP. In 1999, the European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology (EA-OHP) was established at the first European Workshop on Occupational Health Psychology in Lund, Sweden.Houdmont, J. (2009). Across the pond: A history of the European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology. Newsletter of the Society of Occupational Health Psychology, 7, 4‚Äì5. That workshop is considered to be the first EA-OHP conference, the first of a continuing series of conferences EA-OHP organizes and devotes to OHP research and practice. In 2000 the informal International Coordinating Group for Occupational Health Psychology (ICGOHP) was founded for the purpose of facilitating OHP-related research, education, and practice as well as coordinating international conference scheduling. Also in 2000, Work & Stress became associated with the EA-OHP. In 2005, the Society for Occupational Health Psychology (SOHP) was established in the United States.Hammer, L.B., & Schonfeld, I.S. (2007). The historical development of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology (SOHP). Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 1, 2.

Research topics Important theoretical models in OHP research= Three influential theoretical models in OHP research are the demand-control-support, demand-resources, and effort- reward imbalance models.  Demand-control-support model  The most influential model in OHP research has been the original demand-control model. According to the model, the combination of low levels of work-related decision latitude (i.e., autonomy and control over the job) combined with high workloads (high levels of work demands) can be particularly harmful to workers (they can lead to \\"job strain,\\" a term representing the combination of low decision latitude and high workload leading to poorer mental or physical health).Karasek, R.A. (1979). Job demands, job decision latitude, and mental strain: Implications for job redesign. Administrative Science Quarterly, 24(2), 285‚Äì307. The model suggests not only that these two job factors are related to poorer health but that high levels of decision latitude on the job will buffer or reduce the adverse health impact of high levels of demands. Research has clearly supported the idea that decision latitude and demands relate to strains, but research findings about buffering have been mixed with only some studies providing support.de Lange, A.H., Taris, T.W., Kompier, M.A., Houtman, I.L., & Bongers, P.M. (2003). \\"The very best of the millennium\\": Longitudinal research and the demand-control-(support) model. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 8, 282‚Äì305. The demand-control model asserts that job control can come in two broad forms: ‚Äòskill discretion‚Äô and ‚Äòdecision authority‚Äô.Bean, C.G., Winefield, H.R., Sargent, C., & Hutchinson, A.D. (2015). Differential associations of job control components with both waist circumference and body mass index. Social Science & Medicine, 143, 1‚Äì8. Skill discretion refers to the level of skill and creativity required on the job and the flexibility an employee is permitted in deciding what skills to use (e.g. opportunity to use skills, similar to job variety).de Ara√∫jo, T.M., Karasek. R. (2008) Validity and reliability of the job content questionnaire in formal and informal jobs in Brazil. Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment & Health, 6, Suppl. 52‚Äì59 Decision authority refers to employees being able to make decisions about their work (e.g., having autonomy). These two forms of job control are traditionally assessed together in a composite measure of decision latitude; there is, however, some evidence that the two types of job control may not be similarly related to health outcomes.Joensuu, M. et al. (2012). Differential associations of job control components with mortality: A cohort study, 1986‚Äì2005. American Journal of Epidemiology, 175, 609‚Äì619. About a decade after Karasek first introduced the demand-control model, Johnson, Hall, and Theorell (1989),Johnson, J. V., Hall, E. M., & Theorell, T. (1989). Combined effects of job strain and social isolation on cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in a random sample of the Swedish male working population. Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment & Health, 15, 271‚Äì279. in the context of research on heart disease, extended the model to include social isolation. Johnson et al. labeled the combination of high levels of demands, low levels of control, and low levels of coworker support ‚Äúiso-strain.‚Äù The resulting expanded model has been labeled the demand‚Äìcontrol‚Äìsupport (DCS) model. Research that followed the development of this model has suggested that one or more of the components of the DCS model (high psychological workload, low control, and lack of social support), if not the exact combination represented by iso-strain, have adverse effects of physical and mental health.  Effort-reward imbalance model After the DCS model, the second most influential model in OHP research has been the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model.Schonfeld, I.S. (2018). Occupational health psychology. In D.S. Dunn (Ed.), Oxford Bibliographies in Psychology. New York: Oxford University Press. doi:10.1093/OBO/9780199828340-0211 It links job demands to the rewards employees receive for the job.Siegrist, J., & Peter, R. (1994). Job stressors and coping characteristics in work-related disease: Issues of validity. Work & Stress, 8, 130‚Äì140. Siegrist, J. (1996). Adverse health effects of high- effort/low-reward conditions. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 1, 27‚Äì41. That model holds that high work-related effort coupled with low control over job-related intrinsic (e.g., recognition) and extrinsic (e.g., pay) rewards triggers high levels of activation in neurohormonal pathways that, cumulatively, are thought to exert adverse effects on mental and physical health.  Job demands-resources model  An alternative model, the job demands-resources (JD-R) model,Demerouti, E., Bakker, A.B., Nachreiner, F., & Schaufeli, W.B. (2001). The job demands-resources model of burnout. Journal of Applied Psychology, 86, 499‚Äì512. grew out of the DCS model. In the JD-R model, the category of demands (workload) remains more or less the same as in the DCS model although the JD-R model more specifically includes physical demands. Resources, however, are defined as job-relevant features that help workers achieve work-related goals, lessen job demands, or stimulate personal growth. Control and support as per the DCS model are subsumed under resources. Resources can be external (provided by the organization) or internal (part of a worker's personal make-up). In addition to control and support, resources encompassed by the model can also include physical equipment, software, performance feedback from supervisors, the worker's own coping strategies, etc. There has not, however, been as much research on the JD-R model as there has been on the constituents of the DC or DCS model. = Occupational stress and physical health = A number of work- related, psychosocial factors have been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiovascular disease Research has identified health- behavioral and biological factors that are related to increased risk for CVD. These risk factors include smoking, obesity, low density lipoprotein (the \\"bad\\" cholesterol), lack of exercise, and blood pressure. Psychosocial working conditions are also risk factors for CVD. In a case-control study involving two large U.S. data sets, Murphy (1991) found that hazardous work situations, jobs that required vigilance and responsibility for others, and work that required attention to devices were related to increased risk for cardiovascular disability.Murphy, L.R. (1991). Job dimensions associated with severe disability due to cardiovascular disease. Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 44(2), 155‚Äì166. These included jobs in transportation (e.g., air traffic controllers, airline pilots, bus drivers, locomotive engineers, truck drivers), preschool teachers, and craftsmen.

Fredikson, Sundin, and Frankenhaeuser (1985) found that reactions to psychological stressors include increased activity in the brain axes which play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure,Fredrikson M., Sundin O., & Frankenhaeuser M.

A meta-analysis and systematic review involving 29 samples linked job strain to elevated ambulatory blood pressure.Landsbergis, P., Dobson, M., Koutsouras, G., & Schnall, P. (2013).

Psychosocial factors: Review of the empirical data among men. Occupational Medicine: State of the Art Reviews, 15, 24‚Äì46. found that many of the 30 studies covered in their review revealed that decision latitude and psychological workload exerted independent effects on CVD; two studies found synergistic effects, consistent with the strictest version of the demand-control model.Hallqvist, J., Diderichsen, F., Theorell, T., Reuterwall, C., & Ahlbom, A. (1998). Is the effect of job strain on myocardial infarction risk due to interaction between high psychological demands and low decision latitude?

Job strain, workplace social support, and cardiovascular disease: A cross-sectional study of a random sample of the Swedish working population. American Journal of Public Health, 78(10), 1336‚Äì1342. A review of 17 longitudinal studies having reasonably high internal validity found that 8 showed a significant relation between the combination of low levels of decision latitude and high workload (the job strain condition) and CVD and 3 more showed a nonsignificant relation.Belkic, K.L., Landsbergis, P.A., Schnall, P.L., & Baker, D. (2004). Is job strain a source of major cardiovascular risk? Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment, and Health, 30(2), 85‚Äì128. The findings, however, were clearer for men than for women, on whom data were more sparse. Fishta and Back√©'sFishta, A., & Back√©, E. (2015).

International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health, 88,997‚Äì1014. . review-of-reviews also links work-related psychosocial stress to elevated risk of CVD in men. In a massive (n > 197,000) longitudinal study that combined data from 13 independent studies, Kivim√§ki et al.

Job strain as a risk factor for coronary heart disease: A collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data. The Lancet, 380, 1491‚Äì1497. found that, controlling for other risk factors, the combination of high levels of demands and low control at baseline increased the risk of CVD in initially healthy workers by between 20 and 30% over a follow-up period that averaged 7.5 years. In this study the effects were similar for men and women. Meta-analytic research also links job strain (the combination of high demands and low control) to stroke.Huang, Y., Xu, S., Hua, J. et al. (2015). Association between job strain and risk of incident stroke: A meta-analysis. Neurology, 85, 1648‚Äì1654. There is evidence that, consistent with the ERI model, high work-related effort coupled with low control over job-related rewards adversely affects cardiovascular health. At least five studies of men have linked effort-reward imbalance with CVD.Landsbergis, P., et al. (2003). The workplace and cardiovascular disease: Relevance and potential role for occupational health psychology. In J.C. Quick & L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), Handbook of occupational health psychology (pp. 265‚Äì287). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. Another large study links ERI to the incidence of coronary disease.Dragano, N., Siegrist, J., Nyberg, S.T. et al. (2017). Effort-reward imbalance at work and incident coronary heart disease: A multi-cohort study of 90,164 individuals. Epidemiology, 28, 619‚Äì626.  Job-related burnout and cardiovascular health  There is evidence from a prospective study that job-related burnout, controlling for traditional risk factors, such as smoking and hypertension, increases the risk of coronary heart disease over the course of the next three and a half years in workers who were initially disease-free.Toker, S., Melamed, S., Berliner, S., Zeltser, D., & Shapira, I.

Wortley, M. (1991). A prospective study of work perceptions and psychosocial factors affecting the report of back injury. Spine, 16(1), 1‚Äì6. There has been evidence that psychosocial workplace factors (e.g., job strain) also contribute to the development of musculoskeletal problems.M√§ntyniemi, A., Oksanen, T., Salo, P., Virtanen, M., Sj√∂sten, N., Pentti, J., & ...

Examples of workplace incivility include insulting comments, denigration of the target's work, spreading false rumors, social isolation, etc. A summary of research conducted in Europe suggests that workplace incivility is common there.Cortina, L.M., Magley, V., Williams, J.H., & Langhout, R.D. (2001). Incivility in the workplace: Incidence and impact. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 6, 64‚Äì80. In research on more than 1000 U.S. civil service workers, more than 70% of the sample experienced workplace incivility in the past five years. Compared to men, women were more exposed to incivility; incivility was associated with psychological distress and reduced job satisfaction. Abusive supervision Abusive supervision is the extent to which a supervisor engages in a pattern of behavior that harms subordinates.Tepper, B. J. (2000). \\"Consequences of abusive supervision\\".

Sexual harassment Sexual harassment is behavior that denigrates or mistreats an individual due to his or her gender, creates an offensive workplace, and interferes with an individual being able to do the job.Rospenda, K.M., & Richman, J.A.

Workplace violence  Workplace violence is a significant health hazard for employees, both physically and psychologically. ::-Nonfatal assault- Most workplace assaults are nonfatal, with an annual physical assault rate of 6% in the U.S.Schat, A.C.H., Frone, M.R., & Kelloway, E.K.

Assaultive behavior in the workplace often produces injury, psychological distress, and economic loss. One study of California workers found a rate of 72.9 non-fatal, officially documented assaults per 100,000 workers per year, with workers in the education, retail, and health care sectors subject to excess risk.Peek Asa, C., Howard, J., Vargas, L., Kraus, J.F. (1997). Incidence of non-fatal workplace assault injuries determined from employer's reports in California. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 39(1), 44‚Äì50. A Minnesota workers' compensation study found that women workers had a twofold higher risk of being injured in an assault than men, and health and social service workers, transit workers, and members of the education sector were at high risk for injury compared to workers in other economic sectors. A West Virginia workers' compensation study found that workers in the health care sector and, to a lesser extent, the education sector were at elevated risk for assault- related injury.Islam, S.S., Edla, S.R., Mujuru, P., Doyle, E.J., & Ducatman, A.M. (2003). Risk factors for physical assault. State managed workers' compensation experience. American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 25(1), 31‚Äì37. Another workers' compensation study found that excessively high rates of assault-related injury in schools, healthcare, and, to a lesser extent, banking.Hashemi, L., & Webster, B.S. (1998). Non-fatal workplace violence workers' compensation claims (1993 1996). Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 40, 561‚Äì567. In addition to the physical injury that results from being a victim of workplace violence, individuals who witness such violence without being directly victimized are at increased risk for experiencing adverse psychological effects, including high levels of distress and arousal, as found in a study of Los Angeles teachers.Bloch, A.M. (1978). Combat neurosis in inner-city schools.

Civilian labor force (seasonally adjusted)(LNS11000000). Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rate works out to be about 7 homicides per million workers for the one year. Men are more likely to be victims of workplace homicide than women.LaMar W.J., Gerberich, S.G., Lohman, W.H., Zaidman, B. (1998). Work-related physical assault. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 40(4), 317‚Äì324. = Mental disorder = Research has found that psychosocial workplace factors are among the risk factors for a number of categories of mental disorder.  Alcohol abuse  Workplace factors can contribute to alcohol abuse and dependence of employees. Rates of abuse can vary by occupation, with high rates in the construction and transportation industries as well as among waiters and waitresses.Mandell W., Eaton, W.W., Anthony, J.C., & Garrison, R. (1992). Alcoholism and occupations: A review and analysis of 104 occupations. Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 16, 734‚Äì746. Within the transportation sector, heavy truck drivers and material movers were shown to be at especially high risk. A prospective study of ECA subjects who were followed one year after the initial interviews provided data on newly incident cases of alcohol abuse and dependence.Crum, R.M., Muntaner. C., Eaton. W.W., & Anthony. J.C. (1995). Occupational stress and the risk of alcohol abuse and dependence. Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 19, 647‚Äì655. The study found that workers in jobs that combined low control with high physical demands were at increased risk of developing alcohol problems although the findings were confined to men.  Depression  Using data from the ECA study, Eaton, Anthony, Mandel, and Garrison (1990) found that members of three occupational groups, lawyers, secretaries, and special education teachers (but not other types of teachers) showed elevated rates of DSM-III major depression, adjusting for social demographic factors.Eaton, W.W., Anthony, J.C., Mandel, W., & Garrison, R. (1990). Occupations and the prevalence of major depressive disorder. Journal of Occupational Medicine, 32(11), 1079‚Äì1087. The ECA study involved representative samples of American adults from five geographical areas, providing relatively unbiased estimates of the risk of mental disorder by occupation; however, because the data were cross-sectional, no conclusions bearing on cause-and-effect relations are warranted. Evidence from a Canadian prospective study indicated that individuals in the highest quartile of occupational stress (high-strain jobs as per the demand-control model) are at increased risk of experiencing an episode of major depression.Wang J. (2005). Work stress as a risk factor for major depressive episode(s). Psychological Medicine, 35, 865‚Äì871. A literature review and meta-analysis links high demands, low control, and low support to clinical depression.Madsen, I.H., Nyberg, S.T., Magnusson Hanson, L.L., et al. (2017). Job strain as a risk factor for clinical depression: Systematic review and meta-analysis with additional individual participant data. Psychological Medicine, 47, 1342‚Äì135. A meta-analysis that pooled the results of 11 well-designed longitudinal studies indicated that a number of facets of the psychosocial work environment (e.g., low decision latitude, high psychological workload, lack of social support at work, effort-reward imbalance, and job insecurity) increase the risk of common mental disorders such as depression.  Personality disorders  Depending on the diagnosis, severity and individual, and the job itself, personality disorders can be associated with difficulty coping with work or the workplace, potentially leading to problems with others by interfering with interpersonal relationships. Indirect effects also play a role; for example, impaired educational progress or complications outside of work, such as substance abuse and co-morbid mental disorders, can plague sufferers. However, personality disorders can also bring about above-average work abilities by increasing competitive drive or causing the sufferer to exploit his or her co- workers.Ettner, S.L. (2011). Personality disorders and Work. In Schultz & Rogers (Eds.), Work accommodation and retention in mental health (pp. 163‚Äì188). New York: Springer. Ettner, S.L., Maclean, J.C., & French, M.T. (2011). Does having a dysfunctional personality hurt your career? Axis II personality disorders and labor market outcomes. Industrial Relations, 50, 149‚Äì173.  Schizophrenia  In a case-control study, Link, Dohrenwend, and Skodol found that, compared to depressed and well control subjects, schizophrenic patients were more likely to have had jobs, prior to their first episode of the disorder, that exposed them to ‚Äúnoisesome‚Äù work characteristics (e.g., noise, humidity, heat, cold, etc.).Link, B.G., Dohrenwend, B.P., & Skodol, A.E. (1986). Socio-economic status and schizophrenia: Noisome occupational characteristics as a risk factor. American Sociological Review, 51, 242‚Äì258. The jobs tended to be of higher status than other blue collar jobs, suggesting that downward drift in already-affected individuals does not account for the finding. One explanation involving a diathesis-stress model suggests that the job-related stressors helped precipitate the first episode in already-vulnerable individuals. There is some supporting evidence from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study.Muntaner, C., Tien, A.Y., Eaton, W.W., & Garrison R. (1991). Occupational characteristics and the occurrence of psychotic disorders. Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 26, 273‚Äì280. = Psychological distress = Longitudinal studies have suggested adverse working conditions can contribute to the development of psychological distress.Ford, M.T., Matthews, R.A., Wooldridge, J.D., Mishra, V., Kakar, U.M., & Strahan, S.R. (2014). How do occupational stressor-strain effects vary with time? A review and meta-analysis of the relevance of time lags in longitudinal studies. Work & Stress, 28, 9‚Äì30. Psychological distress refers to negative affect, without the individuals necessarily meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder.Dohrenwend, B.P., Shrout, P.E., Egri, G., & Mendelsohn, F.S. (1980). Nonspecific psychological distress and other dimensions of psychopathology: Measures for use in the general population. Archives of General Psychiatry, 37, 1229‚Äì1236.Frank, J.D. (1973). Persuasion and healing. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press. Psychological distress is often expressed in affective (depressive), psychophysical or psychosomatic (e.g., headaches, stomach aches, etc.), and anxiety symptoms. The relation of adverse working conditions to psychological distress is thus an important avenue of research. Job satisfaction is also related to negative health outcomes.Greenberg, E.S., & Grunberg, L. (1995). Work alienation and problem alcohol behavior. Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 36, 83‚Äì102.

(1982). Occupational stress among student nurses: A natural experiment. Journal of Applied Psychology, 67, 784‚Äì796. studied the relation of working conditions to psychological distress in British student nurses. She found that in this \\"natural experiment,\\" student nurses experienced higher levels of distress and lower levels of job satisfaction in medical wards than in surgical wards; compared to surgical wards, medical wards make greater affective demands on the nurses. In another study, Frese (1985)Frese, M. (1985). Stress at work and psychosomatic complaints: A causal interpretation. Journal of Applied Psychology, 70, 314‚Äì328. concluded that objective working conditions (e.g., noise, ambiguities, conflicts) give rise to subjective stress and psychosomatic symptoms in blue collar German workers. In addition to the above studies, a number of other well-controlled longitudinal studies have implicated work stressors in the development of psychological distress and reduced job satisfaction.Carayon, P. (1992). A longitudinal study of job design and worker strain: Preliminary results. In J.C. Quick, L.R. Murphy, & J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds.), Work and well-being: Assessments and instruments for occupational mental health (pp. 19‚Äì32). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. Dormann, C., & Zapf, D. (2002). Social stressors at work, irritation, and depressive symptoms: Accounting for unmeasured third variables in a multi-wave study. Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 75, 33‚Äì58.  Unemployment  A comprehensive meta-analysis involving 86 studies indicated that involuntary job loss is linked to increased psychological distress.Paul, K. I., & Moser, K. (2009). Unemployment impairs mental health: Meta-analyses. Journal of Vocational Behavior, 74, 264‚Äì282. The impact of involuntary unemployment was comparatively weaker in countries that had greater income equality and better social safety nets. The research evidence also indicates that poorer mental health slightly, but significantly, increases the risk of later job loss.  Economic insecurity  Some OHP research is concerned with (a) understanding the impact of economic crises on individuals' physical and mental health and well-being and (b) calling attention to personal and organizational means for ameliorating the impact of the crisis.Probst, T.M., & Sears, L.E. (2009). Stress during the financial crisis. Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 5, 3‚Äì4. Economic insecurity contributes, at least partly, to psychological distress and work-family conflict.Sinclair, R.R., Probst, T., Hammer, L.B., & Schaffer, M.M. (2013). Low income families and occupational health: Implications of economic stress for work-family conflict research and practice. In A.G. Antoniou & C.L. Cooper (Eds.), The psychology of the recession on the workplace (pp. 308‚Äì323). Northampton, MA, US: Edward Elgar Publishing. Ongoing job insecurity, even in the absence of job loss, is related to higher levels of depressive symptoms, psychological distress, and worse overall health.Burgard, S.A., Brand, J.E., & House, J.S. (2009). Perceived job insecurity and worker health in the United States. Social Science & Medicine, 69, 777‚Äì785. .  Work-family balance  Employees must balance their working lives with their home lives. Work‚Äìfamily conflict is a situation in which the demands of work conflict with the demands of family or vice versa, making it difficult to adequately do both, giving rise to distress.Greenhaus, J.G., & Allen, T. (2011). Work-family balance: A review and extension. In J.C. Quick & L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), Handbook of occupational health psychology (2nd ed., pp. 165‚Äì183). Washington DC, American Psychological Association. Although more research has been conducted on work-family conflict, there is also the phenomenon of work-family enhancement, which occurs when positive effects carry over from one domain into the other. = Workplace interventions = A number of stress management interventions have emerged that have shown demonstrable effects in reducing job stress.Richardson, K. M., & Rothstein, H. R. (2008). Effects of occupational stress management intervention programs: A meta-analysis. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 13, 69‚Äì93. Cognitive behavioral interventions have tended to have greatest impact on stress reduction. Industrial organizations OHP interventions often concern both the health of the individual and the health of the organization. Adkins (1999) described the development of one such intervention, an organizational health center (OHC) at a California industrial complex.Adkins, J.A. (1999). Promoting organizational health: The evolving practice of occupational health psychology. Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 30(2), 129 137. The OHC helped to improve both organizational and individual health as well as help workers manage job stress. Innovations included labor-management partnerships, suicide risk reduction, conflict mediation, and occupational mental health support. OHC practitioners also coordinated their services with previously underutilized local community services in the same city, thus reducing redundancy in service delivery. Hugentobler, Israel, and Schurman (1992) detailed a different, multi-layered intervention in a mid-sized Michigan manufacturing plant.Hugentobler, M.K., Israel, B.A., & Schurman, S.J. (1992). An action research approach to workplace health: Integrating methods. Health Education Quarterly, 19(1), 55‚Äì76. The hub of the intervention was the Stress and Wellness Committee (SWC) which solicited ideas from workers on ways to improve both their well-being and productivity. Innovations the SWC developed included improvements that ensured two-way communication between workers and management and reduction in stress resulting from diminished conflict over issues of quantity versus quality. Both the interventions described by Adkins and Hugentobler et al. had a positive impact on productivity.  OHP research at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  Currently there are efforts under way at NIOSH to help reduce the incidence of preventable disorders (e.g., sleep apnea) among heavy- truck and tractor-trailer drivers and, concomitantly, the life-threatening accidents to which the disorders lead,Hitchcock, E. (2008). NIOSH OHP activities. Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 3, 10. improve the health and safety of workers who are assigned to shift work or who work long hours,Caruso, C. (2009).

Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 5, 16‚Äì17. and reduce the incidence of falls among iron workers.Scharf, T., Hunt, J., III, McCann, M., Pierson, R., Migliaccio, F., Limanowski, J., et al. (2010). Hazard recognition for ironworkers: Preventing falls and close calls. Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 9, 8‚Äì9. Military and first responders The Mental Health Advisory Teams of the United States Army employ OHP-related interventions with combat troops.Thomas, J.L. (2008). OHP Research and Practice in the US Army: Mental Health Advisory Teams. Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 4, 4‚Äì5. Genderson, M.R., Schonfeld, I.S., Kaplan, M.S., & Lyons, M.J. (2009).Suicide associated with military service. Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 6, 5‚Äì7. OHP also has a role to play in interventions aimed at helping first responders.Katz, C. (2008). Mental health of 9/11 responders. Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 4, 2‚Äì3. Arnetz, B. (2009). Low-intensity stress in high-stress professionals. Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 7, 6‚Äì7. Modestly scaled interventions Schmitt (2007) described three different modestly scaled OHP-related interventions that helped workers abstain from smoking, exercise more frequently, and shed weight.Schmitt, L. (2007). OHP interventions: Wellness programs. Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 1, 4‚Äì5. Other OHP interventions include a campaign to improve the rates of hand washing, an effort to get workers to walk more often, and a drive to get employees to be more compliant with regard to taking prescribed medicines.Schmitt, L. (2008). OHP interventions: Wellness programs (Part 2). Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 2, 6‚Äì7. The interventions tended reduce organization health-care costs.  Health promotion  Organizations can play a role in the health behavior of employees by providing resources to encourage healthy behavior in areas of exercise, nutrition, and smoking cessation.Bennett, J.B., Cook, R.F., & Pelletier, K.R. (2011). An integral framework for organizational wellness: Core technology, practice models, and case studies In J.C. Quick & L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), Handbook of occupational health psychology (2nd ed., pp. 95‚Äì118). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.  Prevention  Although the dimensions of the problem of workplace violence vary by economic sector, one sector, education, has had some limited success in introducing programmatic, psychologically-based efforts to reduce the level of violence.Schonfeld, I.S. (2006). School violence. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, & J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), Handbook of workplace violence (pp. 169‚Äì229). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. Research suggests that there continue to be difficulties in successfully \\"screening out applicants [for jobs] who may be prone to engaging in aggressive behavior,\\"Day, A.L, & Catano, V.M. (2006) Screening and selecting out violent employees. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, & J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), Handbook of workplace violence (pp. 549‚Äì577). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. suggesting that aggression- prevention training of existing employees may be an alternative to screening. Only a small number of studies evaluating the effectiveness of training programs to reduce workplace violence currently exist.Schat, A.C.H., & Kelloway, E.K. (2006). Training as a workplace aggression intervention strategy. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, & J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), Handbook of workplace violence (pp. 579‚Äì605). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. Total Worker Health Because many companies have implemented worker safety and health measures in a fragmented way,Schill, A. L., & Chosewood, L. C. (2013). The NIOSH Total Worker Health‚Ñ¢ program: An overview. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 55(12 Suppl.), S8‚ÄìS11. a new approach to worker safety and health has emerged in response, driven by efforts advanced by NIOSH. NIOSH trademarked that approach, naming it Total Worker Health. Total Worker Health involves the coordination of evidence-based (a) health promotion practices at the level of the individual worker and (b) umbrella-like health and safety practices at the level of the organizational unit. Research findings indicate that this two-pronged approach is effective in preventing work-related illness and injury.Anger, W. K., Elliot, D. L., Bodner, T., Olson, R., Rohlman, D. S., Truxillo, D. M., & ... Montgomery, D. (2015). Effectiveness of Total Worker Health interventions. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 20, 226‚Äì247. =Accidents and safety= Psychological factors are an important factor in occupational accidents that can lead to injury and death of employees. An important influence on the incidence of accidents is the organization's safety climate that is employees' shared beliefs about how supervisors reward and support safety behavior.Zohar, D. (2010). Thirty years of safety climate research: Reflections and future directions. Accident Analysis and Prevention, 42, 1517‚Äì1522. .

The liner was sold to the Italian Cosulich Line in 1922. In 1932, when Cosulich was absorbed into Italia Flotte Riunite (), the ship was renamed SS Tel Aviv. The ship was scrapped in 1934.  Early career  Martha Washington in 1913 Martha Washington was launched in 1908 by Russell & Co. of Port Glasgow, Scotland for the Austro-American Line (formal name: Unione Austriaca di Navigazione). The liner sailed between Trieste and New York City. On the evening of 20 November 1911, while steaming in the Ionian Sea from Patras and headed for New York, Martha Washington came under fire from an Italian battleship for a period of ten minutes, with shells falling within one ship length (approximately ) of the liner. According to the captain of the liner, the Italians, fighting against Turkey in the Italo-Turkish War, mistook Martha Washington for a Turkish ship. The ship was allowed to pass unharmed after the crew used a signal lamp to communicate her identity to the Italians. At the outbreak of World War I, Martha Washington was interned at Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1914.  World War I  After the United States entered the war, Martha Washington was taken over by the U.S. Army Quartermaster Department on 6 April 1917. The former liner was acquired by the Navy in November 1917. She was commissioned on 2 January 1918 with Commander Chauncey Shackford in command. = Transporting troops to France = Two months of round‚Äëthe‚Äëclock effort restored the ship to seaworthiness and modified her as a troop transport.

Geography  A small dam sits in the upper area of Naryab, which is used by local farmers for irrigation.Tehsils & Unions in the District of Hangu - Government of Pakistan Naryab is bordered by Zargari to the north, Kahi to the east, Tora Wari to the west, and Doaba to the south. normally people use Doaba for small shopping and medical facilities.  Development  Issues facing Naryab include construction of roads and transportation, electricity, medical facilities and formal education. Naryab Road has become a point of contention between JUI-F and PTI, the two big political parties. Gas royalties above five crore rupees have been issued to Tehsil Thall for the construction of Naryab Road. The two parties are contesting the use of the funds. The struggle delayed construction for more than three years. The disagreement became prominent on social media. Another main problem of Naryab is electricity. After the formation of PTI's government in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and the PML-N government, the electricity was disconnected for non-payment. Villagers claim that before 2013, WAPDA (electric utility) was delivering only 10 volts for two hours in 24 hours, making it unreasonable to pay more than two hundred thousand rupees for such limited service. Tribes The main tribe in Naryab is Badha Khel, which is a dispersed sub-tribe of Para Chamkani, now affiliated with the Bangash tribe. Their second occupies neighboring village Chapri Naryab, which is considered a part of the Orakzai tribe. The third is in the Ali Zai area of Orakzai Agency in the Shiite Belt, which is affiliated with Orakzai. The fourth is in the Mirali area of North Waziristan, named as Bado Khel which is affiliated with the Dawar tribe. Their main tribe is in Karman Area of Kurram Agency which is considered a sub-tribe of the Turi tribe i.e. a major Shiite tribe. Historically these are all of the Para Chamkani tribe. History 200x200px The history of Naryab dates back to three hundred years, when this region was populated by migrants from Kurram Agency. Qadir Khan Bangash people migrated from Afghanistan when the area was populated by the Bada Khel sub-tribe of Para Chamkani. These Bada Khels, after settling in Karman, began to convert to Shi'ism under the influence of Turis. According to the Bada Khels, some families who later migrated to Orakzai Agency also adopted Shiite faith. But the Bada Khel families migrated to Naryab and North Waziristan, changing only their tribal identity, remaining Ahl-e-Sunnat. The reason for the dispersal of this sub-tribe is unknown, but the most widely believed cause is their clash with other sub-tribes.Location of Naryab - Falling Rain Genomics  Gallery  File:GetAttachmentjh.jpg File:Naryab.jpg References Category:Union councils of Hangu District Category:Populated places in Hangu District, Pakistan ","title":"Naryab"},{"id":"18079669","text":"The Cape Chidley Islands are members of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in the territory of Nunavut.

Plot  Rykker is an intergalactic warrior trapped on Earth, constantly fighting a gang of ruthless aliens known as The Syndicate, an alien fifth column plotting to take over the planet. The film opens with a high speed chase, with Rykker killing several syndicate agents. Saylon is a top syndicate leader who crash-lands on Earth. His mission is to build a wormhole portal between Earth and his home planet - allowing a full-scale invasion of the Earth. Isis is the Syndicate's sexy and ruthless leader. During a series of robberies for parts to build the portal, Isis becomes determined to destroy Rykker. Fifteen-year-old Julie's family was killed when a truck carrying materials for the portal was hijacked. Left alone in the world, she plots to avenge her family.

The species is endemic to a small area of Tanzania. Common names include turquoise dwarf gecko, William's dwarf gecko, and, in the pet trade, electric blue gecko. Illegal wild-caught specimens are widely sold in the pet trade, often misdescribed as captive-bred. Although L. williamsi breeds in captivity, the young require a lot of care, making large-scale breeding difficult.http://www.reptile- care.de/species/Gekkota/Gekkonidae/Lygodactylus-williamsi.html A captive breeding project and studbook was initiated by EAZA zoos in 2013. The species L. williamsi was placed under EU Appendix B protection in December 2014, under EU Appendix A protection in January 2017, and under CITES Appendix I protection in January 2017. The gecko may not be kept or sold in the EU without documentation and permits, renewable every three years, and geckos must now be registered. Similar restrictions apply in some other jurisdictions. Population The survival of L. williamsi is mostly threatened by (entirely illegal) collection for the international pet trade. It is critically endangered and the population is thought to be declining rapidly. Although trade in wild-caught turquoise day geckos is illegal, wild- caught geckos are commonly sold in pet shops. It is estimated that between December 2004 and July 2009, at least 32,310 to 42,610 geckos were taken by one collecting group, ~15% of the wild population at the time. =Geographic range= L. williamsi is only found in of the Kimboza Forest, Ruvu Forest Reserve, Mbagalala and Muhalama at an altitude of .United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (November 2013). Review of Lygodactylus williamsi.. Retrieved 27 October 2015. These are located at the foothills of the Uluguru Mountains in eastern Tanzania. The subpopulation in Kimboza Forest Reserve was estimated at 150,000 adults in 2009. The size of the remaining subpopulations is unknown, but their size is not thought to contribute significantly to the total population. The two known sites outside protected areas are tiny: one consists of 14 Pandanus trees (the rest has been cleared for banana plantations) and the other is equally close to disappearing.Maisch H (2013). \\"Reasons to feel blue\\". Zooquaria 83: 24. Habitat In the wild, the turquoise day gecko lives exclusively on the (redlisted endemic) screwpine, Pandanus rabaiensis, mostly in the leaf crown. It only lives on large trees, those with leaves more than long.CITES Proposal for inclusion A single leaf crown will typically contain a single individual, or an adult male, an adult female, and juveniles. It eats small insects and drinks water from leaves. It is also fond of nectar. =Habitat loss= Collectors commonly cut down screwpine trees to reach the geckos living in the leaf crest, destroying the gecko's habitat. Many geckos are thought to die while being shipped to market. The pet trade is likely a worse threat than habitat loss. L. williamsi's tropical forest habitat is also shrinking and fragmenting. Neither of the Catchment Forest Reserves where it occurs is well- protected. The forest is seriously threatened by pet collectors, clearing for farmland, illegal logging, increasingly frequent fires, mining of rubies, tourmaline, rhodolite, gold and dolomite and limestone from outcrops on which the screwpines grow. Invasive trees such as Cedrela are also a threat. There is little forest left unaffected. Appearance Males of L. williamsi are bright blue with heavy black throat stripes, visible preanal pores, and hemipenile bulges. Females range from brown or bronze to bright green, and have little to no black on the throat. Females can easily be confused with juvenile or socially suppressed males that are also green, sometimes with a bluish cast. The underside of both sexes is orange. Colours of individuals vary according to mood and temperature. Males may range from black or gray to brilliant electric blue. Females may range from dark brown to brilliant green with turquoise highlights. Adult snout-vent length (SVL) is .

Behavior Like all geckos of the genera Lygodactylus and Phelsuma, L. williamsi is diurnal. It is bold, active, and social. Males are territorial, and do not generally tolerate the presence of other males. Social gestures include lateral flattening, puffing out of the throat patch, head shaking and head bobbing, and tail-wagging. Reproduction Males of L. williamsi court females with lateral flattening, puffing out of the throat pouch, and head bobbing. Two to three weeks after copulation, the female lays a clutch of 1 or 2 pea-sized white, hard-shelled eggs which are glued to a surface in a secure, hidden location. Eggs hatch in 60 to 90 days.

Among systems that have been characterized as secular religions are capitalism,Kojin Karatani, Transcritique: On Kant and Marx (MIT Press: 2003), p. 212 communism,Gentile, p. 2 Juche,Armstrong, Charles K. (2005). \\"Familism, Socialism and Political Religion in North Korea\\".

Contemporary characterizations The term secular religion is often applied today to communal belief systems‚Äîas for example with the view of love as our postmodern secular religion.U. Beck/E. Beck-Gernsheim, The Normal Chaos of Love (1995) Chap. 6 Paul Vitz applied the term to modern psychology in as much as it fosters a cult of the self, explicitly calling \\"the self-theory ethic [...] this secular religion\\".Paul C. Vitz, Psychology as Religion: The Cult of Self- worship (1994) p. 145 Sport has also been considered as a new secular religion, particularly with respect to Olympism.H. Preuss/ K. Liese, Internationalism in the Olympic Movement (2011) p. 44 For Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic Games, belief in them as a new secular religion was explicit and lifelong.B. W. Ritchie/D. Adair, Sport Tourism (2004) p. 1988 Political religion The theory of political religion concerns governmental ideologies whose cultural and political backing is so strong that they are said to attain power equivalent to those of a state religion, with which they often exhibit significant similarities in both theory and practice.Gentile, Emilio: Politics as Religion (2006) Princeton University Press In addition to basic forms of politics, like parliament and elections, it also holds an aspect of \\"sacralization\\" related to the institutions contained within the regime and also provides the inner measures traditionally considered to be religious territory, such as ethics, values, symbols, myths, rituals, archetypes and for example a national liturgical calendar. Political religious organizations, such as the Nazi Party, adhered to the idealization of cultural and political power over the country at large. The church body of the state no longer held control over the practices of religious identity. Because of this, Nazism was countered by many political and religious organizations as being a political religion, based on the dominance which the Nazi regime had (Gates and Steane).\\"Political Religion -the influence of Ideological and Identity Orientation\\" (2009) Political religions generally vie with existing traditional religions, and may try to replace or eradicate them. The term was given new attention by the political scientist Hans Maier. Totalitarian societies are perhaps more prone to political religion, but various scholars have described features of political religion even in democracies, for instance American civil religion as described by Robert Bellah in 1967. The term is sometimes treated as synonymous with civil religion, but although some scholars use the terms equivalently, others see a useful distinction, using \\"civil religion\\" as something weaker, which functions more as a socially unifying and essentially conservative force, whereas a political religion is radically transformational, even apocalyptic.Gentile, Emilio: Politics as Religion (2006) Princeton University Press, s.xxii =Overview= The term political religion is based on the observation that sometimes political ideologies or political systems display features more commonly associated with religion. Scholars who have studied these phenomena include William Connolly in political science, Christoph Deutschmann in sociology, Emilio Gentile in history, Oliver O'Donovan in theology and others in psychology. A political religion often occupies the same ethical, psychological and sociological space as a traditional religion, and as a result it often displaces or co-opts existing religious organizations and beliefs. The most central marker of a political religion involves the sacralization of politics, for example an overwhelming religious feeling when serving one's country, or the devotion towards the Founding Fathers of the United States.Morris, Benjamin Franklin: The Christian Life & Character of the Civil Institutions of the United States; Developed in the Official and Historical Annals of the Republic (1864) Philadelphia: George W. ChildsGentile, Emilio: Politics as Religion (2006) Princeton University Press, p.22 Although a political religion may co-opt existing religious structures or symbolism, it does not itself have any independent spiritual or theocratic elements‚Äîit is essentially secular, using religious motifs and methods for political purposes, if it does not reject religious faith outright.For a compelling opinion on this important distinction, see Angela Astoria Kurtz, \\"God, not Caesar: Revisiting National Socialism as 'Political Religion'\\" in History of European Ideas, Vol. 35; No. 2 (June 2009) Typically, a political religion is considered to be secular, but more radical forms of it are also transcendental.Angela Astoria Kurtz, \\"God, not Caesar: Revisiting National Socialism as 'Political Religion'\\" in History of European Ideas, Vol. 35; No. 2 (June 2009)Gentile, Emilio: Politics as Religion (2006) Princeton University Press, p.20 =Origin of the theory= The 18th-century philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712‚Äì1778) argued that all societies need a religion to hold men together. Because Christianity tended to pull men away from earthly matters, Rousseau advocated a \\"civil religion\\" that would create the links necessary for political unity around the state. The Swiss Protestant theologian Adolf Keller (1872‚Äì1963) argued that Marxism in the Soviet Union had been transformed into a secular religion. Before emigrating to the United States, the German-born political philosopher Eric Voegelin wrote a book entitled The political religions. Other contributions on \\"political religion\\" (or associated terms such as \\"secular religion\\", \\"lay religion\\" or \\"public religion\\") were made by Luigi Sturzo (1871‚Äì1959), Paul Tillich (1886‚Äì1965), Gerhard Leibholz (1901‚Äì1982), Waldemar Gurian (1902‚Äì1954), Raymond Aron (1905‚Äì1983) and Walter Benjamin (1892‚Äì1940).Gentile, Emilio: Politics as Religion (2006) Princeton University Press, chapters 3-4 Some saw such \\"religions\\" as a response to the existential void and nihilism caused by modernity, mass society and the rise of a bureaucratic state, and in political religions \\"the rebellion against the religion of God\\" reached its climax. They also described them as \\"pseudo-religions\\", \\"substitute religions\\", \\"surrogate religions\\", \\"religions manipulated by man\\" and \\"anti- religions\\". Yale political scientist Juan Linz and others have noted that the secularization of the twentieth century had created a void which could be filled by an ideology claiming a hold on ethical and identical matters as well, making the political religions based on totalitarianism, universalism and messianic missions (such as Manifest DestinyGamble, Richard: Savior Nation: Woodrow Wilson and a gospel of service (2001) Humanitas vol.XIV, nro.1 ) possible. Griffin, Roger Fascism, Totalitarianism and Political Religion, p. 7 2005Routledge Gentile, Emilio: Politics as Religion (2006) Princeton University Press, chapters 2-4 An academic journal with the name Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions started publication in 2000. It was renamed Politics, Religion & Ideology in 2011. It is published by Taylor & Francis. =Typical aspects= Key qualities often (not all are always present) shared by political religion include: *Structural ** Differentiation between self and other, and demonisation of other (in theistic religion, the differentiation usually depends on adherence to certain dogmas and social behaviours; in political religion, differentiation may be on grounds such as nationality, social attitudes, or membership in \\"enemy\\" political parties, instead). ** A transcendent leadership, either with messianic tendencies, often a charismatic figurehead. ** Strong, hierarchical organisational structures. ** The control of education, in order to ensure the security, continuation and the veneration of the existing system. *Belief ** A coherent belief system for imposing symbolic meaning on the external world, with an emphasis on security through faith in the system. ** An intolerance of other ideologies of the same type. ** A degree of utopianism. ** The belief that the ideology is in some way natural or obvious, so that (at least for certain groups of people) those who reject it are in some way \\"blind\\". ** A genuine desire on the part of individuals to convert others to the cause. ** A willingness to place ends over means‚Äîin particular, a willingness (for some) to use violence or/and fraud. ** Fatalism‚Äîa belief that the ideology will inevitably triumph in the end. Not all of these aspects are present in any one political religion; this is only a list of some common aspects. =Suppression of religious beliefs= Political religions compete with existing religions, and try, if possible, to replace or eradicate them. Loyalty to other entities, such as a church or a deity, are often viewed as interfering with loyalty to the political religion. The authority of religious leaders also presents a threat to the authority of the political religion. As a result, some or all religious sects may be suppressed or banned. An existing sect may be converted into a state religion, but dogma and personnel may be modified to suit the needs of the party or state. Where there is suppression of religious institutions and beliefs, this might be explicitly accompanied by atheistic doctrine as in state atheism. Juan Linz has posited the friendly form of separation of church and state as the counterpole of political religion but describes the hostile form of separation of church and state as moving toward political religion as found in totalitarianism. =Absolute loyalty= Loyalty to the state or political party and acceptance of the government/party ideology are paramount. Dissenters may be expelled, ostracized, discriminated against, imprisoned, \\"re-educated\\", or killed. Loyalty oaths or membership in a dominant (or sole) political party may be required for employment, obtaining government services, or simply as routine. Criticism of the government may be a serious crime. Enforcement can range from ostracism by one's neighbours to execution. In a political religion, you are either with the system or against it. =Cult of personality= A political religion often elevates its leaders to near-godlike status. Displays of leaders in the form of posters or statues may be mandated in public areas and even private homes. Children may be required to learn the state's version of the leaders' biographies in school. =Myths of origin= Political religions often rely on a myth of origin that may have some historical basis but is usually idealized and sacralized. Current leaders may be venerated as descendants of the original fathers. There may also be holy places or shrines that relate to the myth of origin. Historical casesRevolutionary France = The Festival of the Supreme Being, by Pierre-Antoine Demachy. Revolutionary France was well noted for being the first state to reject religion altogether. Radicals intended to replace Christianity with a new state religion, or a deistic ideology. Maximilien Robespierre rejected atheistic ideologies and intended to create a new religion. Churches were closed, and Catholic Mass was forbidden.http://www.sullivan-county.com/identity/shanda.htm The Cult of the Supreme Being was well known for its derided festival, which led to the Thermidorian reaction and the fall of Robespierre.Kennedy, p. 345. (A Cultural History of the French Revolution) =Fascism= Italian fascism According to Emilio Gentile, \\"Fascism was the first and prime instance of a modern political religion.\\" \\"This religion sacralized the state and assigned it the primary educational task of transforming the mentality, the character, and the customs of Italians. The aim was to create a 'new man', a believer in and an observing member of the cult of Fascism.\\"Gentile, The Sacralization of Politics in Fascist Italy, p.ix. \\"The argument [that fascism was a ‚Äòpolitical religion‚Äô] tends to involve three main claims: I) that fascism was characterized by a religious form, particularly in terms of language and ritual; II) that fascism was a sacralized form of totalitarianism, which legitimized violence in defence of the nation and regeneration of a fascist 'new man'; and III) that fascism took on many of the functions of religion for a broad swathe of society.\\" Nazi Germany \\"Among committed [Nazi] believers, a mythic world of eternally strong heroes, demons, fire and sword‚Äîin a word, the fantasy world of the nursery‚Äîdisplaced reality.\\"Burleigh, The Third Reich, (London: Macmillan, 2000) pp.8-9. Heinrich Himmler was fascinated by the occult, and sought to turn the SS into the basis of an official state cult.N. Goodrick-Clarke, The Occult Roots of Nazism (Wellingborough: the Aquarian Press, 1985), and P. Levenda, Unholy Alliance (New York: Continuum, 2002). =Soviet Union= In 1936 a Protestant priest referred explicitly to communism as a new secular religion. A couple of years later, on the eve of World War II, F. A. Voigt characterised both Marxism and National Socialism as secular religions, akin at a fundamental level in their authoritarianism and messianic beliefsF. A. Voigt, Unto Caesar (1938) p. 37 as well as in their eschatological view of human History.Voigt, pp. 17‚Äì20, p. 71 and pp. 98‚Äì9 Both, he considered, were waging religious war against the liberal enquiring mind of the European heritage.Voigt, p. 203 After the war, the social philosopher Raymond Aron would expand on the exploration of communism in terms of a secular religion;Aron, Raymond. The Opium of the Intellectuals. London: Secker & Warburg, 1957, pp. 265‚Äì294 while A. J. P. Taylor, for example, would characterise it as \\"a great secular religion....the Communist Manifesto must be counted as a holy book in the same class as the Bible\\".Quoted in Chris Wrigley, A. J. P. Taylor (2006) pp. 229 and 202 Klaus- Georg Riegel argued that \\"Lenin's utopian design of a revolutionary community of virtuosi as a typical political religion of an intelligentsia longing for an inner-worldly salvation, a socialist paradise without exploitation and alienation, to be implanted in the Russian backward society at the outskirts of the industrialised and modernised Western Europe.\\" Modern examplesTurkmenistan= During the long rule of President Saparmurat Niyazov (President from 1990 to 2006) large pictures and statues of him could be seen in public places in Turkmenistan. In an interview with the television-news program \\"60 Minutes\\", Niyazov said the people of Turkmenistan placed them there voluntarily because they love him so much, and that he did not originally want them there. In addition, he granted himself the title \\"T√ºrkmenba≈üy\\", meaning \\"Leader of all Ethnic Turkmens\\" in the Turkmen language. A book purportedly authored by Niyazov, Ruhnama (\\"Book of the Soul\\", first published in 1994) was required reading in Turkmenistani educational institutions and was often displayed and treated with the same respect as the Qur'an. The study of Ruhnama in the academic system was scaled down after Niyazov's death in 2006 but to some extent continues . See alsoReferencesFurther reading * A.

This group includes all instruments generally called string instruments (list) in the west, as well as many (but not all) keyboard instruments, such as pianos and harpsichords. Chordophones (3)Simple chordophones or zithers (31)= Instruments which are in essence simply a string or strings and a string bearer. These instruments may have a resonator box, but removing it should not render the instrument unplayable (although it may result in quite a different sound being produced). They include the piano therefore, as well as other kinds of zithers such as the koto, and musical bows. Bar or stick zithers (311) The string bearer is bar shaped. 311.1 Musical bows - The string bearer is flexible (and curved). 311.11 Idiochord musical bows - The string is cut from the bark of the cane, remaining attached at each end. 311.111 Mono-idiochord musical bows - Containing one string only 311.112 Poly- idiochord musical bows or harp-bows - Containing several strings that pass over some type of bridge. 311.12 Heterochord musical bows - The string is of separate material from the bearer. 311.121 Mono-heterochord musical bows - The bow has one heterochord string only. 311.121.1 Without resonator. 311.121.11 Without tuning noose. 311.121.12 With tuning noose. 311.121.2 With resonator. 311.121.21 With independent resonator. 311.121.22 With resonator attached. 311.121.221 Without tuning noose. 311.121.222 With tuning noose. 311.122 Poly- heterochord musical bows - The bow has several heterochord strings. 311.122.1 Without tuning noose. 311.122.2 With tuning noose. 311.2 Stick zithers - With rigid string carrier 311.21 Musical bow/stick - The string carrier has one rigid and one flexible end. 311.211 Instrument has one resonator gourd 311.22 True stick zithers - NB Round sticks which happen to be hollow by chance do not belong on this account to the tube zithers, but are round-bar zithers; however, instruments in which a tubular cavity is employed as a true resonator, like the modern Mexican harpa, are tube zithers. 311.221 With one resonator gourd. 311.222 With several resonator gourds. Tube zithers (312) The string bearer is a vaulted surface. 312.1 Whole tube zithers - The string carrier is a complete tube 312.11 Idiochord tube zithers. 312.12 Heterochord tube zithers. 312.121 Without extra resonator. 312.122 With extra resonator. 312.2 Half-tube zithers - The strings are stretched along the convex surface of a gutter. 312.21 Idiochord half-tube zithers. 312.22 Heterochord half-tube zithers.

In 1855 he graduated from the department of natural sciences at the University of Moscow, afterwards furthering his education at several natural history museums throughout Europe. During this time period he also attended lectures from prominent zoologists that included Isidore Geoffroy Saint- Hilaire (1805‚Äì1861) and √âmile Blanchard (1819‚Äì1900). In 1858 he returned to Moscow, where he performed post-graduate work and helped establish a department of zoology. In 1861 he became head of the department of zoology, later becoming director of the zoological museum at Moscow (1863), a position he maintained for the rest of his life. Bogdanov was known for his organizational skills, and was a major factor in the founding of the zoological gardens in Moscow, as well as the establishment of a number of scientific societies, such as the Society of Devotees of Natural Science, Anthropology, and Ethnography (). This society was founded in 1863 with the goal of spreading scientific knowledge to the Russian people, and creating an atmosphere where professionals and amateurs could work together in their love of natural sciences. Through this institution, Bogdanov was able to raise money and resources to create an All-Russian Ethnographic Exhibition (), which made its debut in April 1867. This exhibition consisted of dioramas with hundreds of mannequins representing 60 ethnic groups that populated the Russian Empire. Bogdanov is also credited for translating several German and French textbooks on zoology and entomology into Russian. He died in Moscow.

This can include a column of air being set in vibration (as in wind instruments) or an air-flow being interrupted by an edge (as in free-reeds). The instrument itself does not vibrate, and there are no vibrating strings or membranes. Aerophones (4)Free aerophones (41)= Instruments where the vibrating air is not enclosed by the instrument itself. *bullroarer *Siren (noisemaker) Displacement free aerophones (411) The air-stream meets a sharp edge, or a sharp edge is moved through the air. In either case, according to more recent views, a periodic displacement of air occurs to the alternate flanks of the edge. Examples are the swordblade or the whip. * Swordblade * Whip Interruptive free aerophones (412) The air-stream is interrupted periodically 412.1 Idiophonic interruptive aerophones or reeds - The air- stream is directed against a lamella, setting it in periodic vibration to interrupt the stream intermittently. In this group also belong reeds with a 'cover,' i.e. a tube in which the air vibrates only in a secondary sense, not producing the sound but simply adding roundness and timbre to the sound made by the reed's vibration; generally recognizable by the absence of fingerholes. 412.11 Concussion reeds - Two lamellae make a gap which closes periodically during their vibration. 412.12 Percussion reeds - A single lamella strikes against a frame. 412.121 Independent percussion reeds. 412.122 Sets of percussion reeds. - Earlier organs 412.13 Free-reed instruments feature a reed which vibrates within a closely fitting slot (there may be an attached pipe, but it should only vibrate in sympathy with the reed, and not have an effect on the pitch - instruments of this class can be distinguished from 422.3 by the lack of finger-holes). 412.131 Individual free reeds. *Bawu *Party horn *Pitch pipe 412.132 Sets of free reeds. *Accordica (mouth organ) *Accordina (instrument) *Accordion *Accordola *Accordolin (mouth organ) *Bandoneon *Bandonium *Concertina *Harmoneon *Harmonica *Harmonium *Melodica *Reed organ *Sheng *Vibrandoneon (instrument) 412.14 Band reed instruments - The air hits the sharp edge of a band under tension.

BiographyEarly life= She was born in Bayreuth, the daughter of Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth by his first wife, Princess Wilhelmine of Prussia, the favourite sister of King Frederick the Great. Both the Margrave and the Margravine hoped for the eventual birth of a son and heir; however, this never happened. Thus, Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie grew up as an only child at the court of her father in Bayreuth. At the time of her birth, her parents' marriage was still intact. However, during the following years the couple became estranged as Margrave Frederick turned his affections to other women. His most prominent mistress was Wilhelmine von Marwitz, one of his wife's ladies-in-waiting. Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie was considered one of the most beautiful princesses of her time. The girl was praised by Italian serial lover and writer Casanova himself as \\"the most beautiful princess in Germany\\". As an only child, she had a rigorous education and was prepared for a high and noble marriage. =Marriage= In January 1744 the ruling Duke Charles Eugene of W√ºrttemberg visited Bayreuth and fell in love with Elisabeth. Her uncle, King Frederick II the Great of Prussia, promoted Charles Eugene as a good match for her, because he had known him during the two years he was educated at the Prussian court. Although the Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and the King of Denmark were also suitors of the princess, Elisabeth's family chose Charles Eugene. On 26 September 1748 the marriage of Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie and Charles Eugene took place in Bayreuth. The wedding was the most festive celebration in the history of the margraviate. Within the framework of the brilliant festivities the margrave's opera house was opened and commemorative coins with half-length portraits of the young couple were stamped with the saying \\"If the lit flames are extinguished tenfold, they will only burn brighter\\". The marriage was initially happy, but began to sour after a few years. Elisabeth was resentful over her total lack of influence in state affairs. The couple's disagreements led to‚Äîand then were compounded by‚ÄîCharles Eugene's decision to no longer hide his infidelities. no longer encumbered by a pretense of fidelity, the duke began to spend much of his time with his mistresses. Despite their increasing disputes, Elisabeth became pregnant. On 19 February 1750 Elisabeth gave birth to their only child, a daughter, Princess Fredericka Wilhelmine Augusta Luisa Charlotte of W√ºrttemberg, who died on 12 March 1751 shortly after her first birthday. The absence of a male heir increased the conflicts between the young couple. The need for an heir calmed their relations for a while, but after a journey to Italy in 1753 the Duke began taking mistresses again and new disputes arose. The ducal couple became permanently estranged in 1756, when Charles Eugene despotically arrested and illegally imprisoned Elisabeth's friend, chamber singer Marianne Pirker. Castle Fantaisie (north view). During the Seven Years' War Charles Eugene joined of the alliance of Austria and France against Prussia and England and in doing so destroyed his friendly connections with the Prussian King. When in the autumn of 1756 Elisabeth visited her mother in Bayreuth, she refused to return to her husband in W√ºrttemberg. The dispute over the state of her marriage to Charles Eugene was now out in the open. It took until 1759 for Elisabeth's father and Charles Eugene to make a final agreement. The marriage would not be dissolved, and Elisabeth would remain as Duchess of W√ºrttemberg. Charles Eugene and the estates of W√ºrttemberg were bound to pay 54.000 guilders of maintenance to her annually. However, Charles Eugene kept the right to determine her household. In this way he remained informed about her activities and could also affect her circumstances. After the death of her father in 1763, Elisabeth inherited the castle (German: Schloss) near Donndorf (now municipality Eckersdorf), which was still under construction. It had been begun by the Margrave Frederick, but was not completed until 1765. She remodeled and furnished the Schloss to suit her taste and personality, and gave it the name of Schloss Fantaisie which it still bears today. She died in the Old Castle (Alten Schloss) in Bayreuth, aged forty-seven. At her request, she was buried in the Castle Chapel of Bayreuth (Schlosskirche Bayreuth) beside her parents.

The Lehigh Valley Railroad's four track mainline was located directly in the middle of the town, which was situated around present-day Mauser Street. Laurys Station, at one point in time, had its own amusement park on an island in the river. Founded by the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company in 1891 and known as Laury's Island, it included attractions such as steamboat rides, a merry-go-round, and a large dancing pavilion. It was frequently used by social and church groups in the area for gatherings, as well as local family reunions. The Allentown Band held regular concerts there.

He was capped 27 times; 6 times at wing and 21 times at centre, scoring 6 tries. Rugby career Born in Victoria West and educated at Paarl Boys High, he went to Stellenbosch University; an institution known for serving as a conveyor belt of future Springboks. Later on he joined the South African Air Force in Pretoria where he was a Harvard instructor. He won his first cap, at wing, against Wales in Cardiff in 1960, which the Springboks won 3-0 thanks to a Keith Oxlee penalty. The selectors chose him as a wing on occasions as they thought him difficult to combine with in mid-field. He possessed a great deal of pace and was a ferocious defender, despite his lack of size. He was perhaps best known for his tackle on England and British Lions flyhalf Richard Sharp, while playing for Northern Transvaal (the Blue Bulls) in 1962, which broke Sharp's jaw or cheekbone. Controversy seemed to follow him almost throughout his career, with Roux achieving notoriety on the demo- ridden 1969/70 Springbok tour of the United Kingdom for kicking one protester in the backside and hurling the ball at another. Retirement Retiring in 1970, after he led Griqualand West to only their third Currie Cup title to date (having also represented Western Province at the start of his career, in addition to Northern Transvaal), he eventually returned to the town of his birth. He and his wife Charlotte are currently running a shop and museum called Victoria Trading Post in Victoria West. Trivia According to legend, he got his nickname (originally \\"Mannetjie\\", Afrikaans for little man) from a domestic worker, who apparently found his cockiness quite amusing. The \\"s\\" at the end was added only much later by his wife. The addition of the \\"s\\" is affectionate. During a conversation, Mannetjies referred to the house in Victoria West where he played as a young boy. The high stoep (porch) around the house made the domestic worker to warn him with ‚ÄúMannetjie, pasop dat jy nie daar afval nie‚Äù (\\"Mannetjie watch out that you don‚Äôt fall down from there\\"). Follow link to see picture The Afrikaans artist Laurika Rauch has a well-known song with the title \\"Stuur groete aan Mannetjies Roux\\" (\\"Greetings to Mannetjies Roux\\") and a film based on the song.

History Sacred Heart, built in 1875, was the third German Roman Catholic church constructed in Detroit.Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church Complex from Detroit1701 The parish was founded to serve the German members of the Detroit community, not only with the church itself, but also with its primary and secondary schools. The church continued as a primarily German parish until after World War I, when large numbers of blacks moved into Detroit and settled along Hastings Street. The German population slowly moved out at this time. Sacred Heart Church Rectory In 1911, some of the newer black residents of the Catholic faith established a chapel at old St. Mary's.Sacred Heart of Jesus Church history In 1914, the growing congregation moved to a converted Episcopalian church at Eliot and Beaubien. The church flourished, and in the late 1930s, the congregation petitioned to move to the nearby Sacred Heart, due in part to the school building on the site. In 1938, Sacred Heart was converted from a German parish to an African American parish. The congregation at this time measured approximately 1500 members, and they quickly utilized the school at Sacred Heart, graduating the first high school class in 1945. After World War II, the Interstate 75 freeway was built through the area, displacing the black parishioners living on Hastings. In 1957, the parish closed its secondary school and, eight years later, its primary school. However, the church still continues to offer weekly mass. Architecture The Sacred Heart church is a red brick, pedimented Italianate structure with an entrance projecting toward the street. The wood belfry and spire are painted a cream color, contrasting with the deep red of the brick walls. Six bays with two story windows line both sides of this church.

It is the story of two sisters (played by Ineko Arima and Ozu regular Setsuko Hara) who are reunited with a mother who left them as children. The film is considered amongst Ozu's darkest postwar films; it is well received though lesser known. Synopsis Akiko Sugiyama (Ineko Arima) is a college student learning English shorthand. Her elder sister Takako (Setsuko Hara), running away from an unhappy marriage, has returned home to stay with Akiko and their father Shukichi (Chish≈´ Ry≈´) in Tokyo, together with her toddler girl. Shukichi works in a bank in Tokyo. Akiko has a relationship with her college boyfriend Kenji (Masami Taura), which results in an unwanted pregnancy. Later, Akiko has an abortion, after an encounter in which she realizes that her boyfriend does not love her. While going to a mahjong parlour to look for Kenji, Akiko comes across its proprietress Kisako (Isuzu Yamada), who seems to know a lot about her family. Back at home, Takako hears about Kisako from Akiko, and pieces together the fact that she is their long-lost mother. Takako visits the parlour to ask Kisako not to reveal to Akiko who she really is ‚Äì but the plan backfires. Akiko learns of her visit and goes to confront Takako. Takako then discloses to her that Kisako is their mother, who ran away with another man when Akiko was still a toddler. Shaken, Akiko goes to confront Kisako to ask if she is the daughter of her father. She leaves in a huff, upset by Kisako abandoning her as a child, then goes to a Chinese noodle shop for some sake. Her boyfriend Kenji enters, and the two have an argument. Akiko leaves angrily, and she is hit by a train at an intersection just outside the shop. Akiko is badly injured, and she expresses the wish to live and start life over again in the presence of her father and sister. In the next scene, however, in one of Ozu's famous ellipses, a bitter Takako goes to visit her mother to tell her the news of Akiko's death. Kisako is distraught, and agrees with her husband that she will leave Tokyo for his new job in Hokkaido. Just prior to their departure, she goes to the Sugiyamas to offer her condolences, and to tell Takako of her decision. Takako does not go to send her off at the railway station. In the last scene of the film, Takako reveals to her father that she is going back to her husband to try to make their marriage work again. She does not want her daughter to have the same experience as Akiko, who grew up without knowing one of her parents. Shukichi agrees with her decision.

Some historians think that Via Militaris crossed Moravac.. In Moravac in 1985 during archaeological research, 27 Roman tombs dating from the early Middle Ages were excavated. Archeologists had found a copper coin of Manuel Comnenus, and a couple of earrings with node, from between the 9th and 13th centuries.

It marked the first appearance of the character Felix the Cat. Plot Master Tom (Felix), a male black cat, meets a female white cat. He serenades his new love interest, and announces his intention to devote his nine lives to her. Tom's singing wakes up an entire neighborhood. Tom later finds out that his love interest is the mother of a large litter of kittens. In reaction, Tom runs towards the local gasworks. Tom commits suicide by intentionally inhaling coal gas. Production The film was produced by the Pat Sullivan Studio of New York City, owned by Australian animator Pat Sullivan. It is a matter of dispute whether to attribute the film and Felix's creation to Sullivan himself, or to Otto Messmer, the studio's lead animator. Messmer's claim to have been the sole creator of Felix has parallels in animation history. Ub Iwerks claimed that he created Mickey Mouse, instead of studio owner Walt Disney. Grim Natwick claimed that he created Betty Boop, instead of studio owner Max Fleischer. In 1970s interviews, Messmer claimed that the Pat Sullivan Studio was overly busy in 1919. When Paramount Pictures demanded an extra film to be produced, Pat Sullivan did not have enough time to work on it. He reportedly assigned the film's production to Messmer, who served as the film's only animator. Messmer claimed to have created the entire film within his own home, instead of the studio office. Feline Follies was not the first short film by the Pat Sullivan Studio to feature a black cat as a protagonist. The studio's first cat-themed animated film was The Tail of Thomas Kat (1917), currently a lost film. The earlier's short protagonist was called \\"Thomas Kat\\". In Feline Follies, Felix appears under a similar alias: \\"Master Tom\\". Black cats were also a recurring element in a film series by the Pat Sullivan Studio, the Charlie or Charley series. The series was based on the screen persona of then-popular actor Charlie Chaplin. A black cat identical in design to Felix in Feline Follies had appeared in promotional materials for the animated short How Charlie Captured the Kaiser (August 1918). The cat was given its own scene in the subsequent short Charlie in the Farm (1919). The main visual gag from this scene was then re-used in Feline Follies. This suggests that Felix may have slowly evolved from these precursors, instead of first appearing in Feline Follies. Animation historian Gerald Carr has attributed the lettering of Feline Follies to Pat Sullivan, based on similarities with Sullivan's known works. The line art and visual forms of the film were also found to be similar to Pat Sullivan's previous works on comic strips. The dialogue in Feline Follies appears in written form. A litter of kittens uses the term \\"Mum\\" for their mother, a spelling more common to Australian English and British English than American English. Messmer also had a background in comic strips, and he reportedly had a \\"quite proficient\\" drawing style, with \\"well-crafted line work and very convincing volumetric forms\\". Sullivan's drawing style appeared \\"rougher\\" and had a \\"more angular execution\\". A number of \\"incongruous\\" design features and contrasting design styles in Feline Follies and other early Felix short films may indicate that more than animator was involved in its production. The serenade scene of the film was recycling a serenade scene from Charlie in the Farm. Tom's reaction to the prospect of becoming a stepfather was recycled from another scene of the same film. In Charlie in the Farm, a male bird marries. Following the marriage, he discovers that his wife has chicks from a previous relationship. The male bird runs away from his new family. Release Feline Follies was released on November 9, 1919,http://saskatoonsymphony.org/the- origins-of-felix-the-cat/ as one of the films in the Paramount Screen Magazine. The initial distributor was the company Famous Players-Lasky (later known as Paramount Pictures). The distribution of the Felix was subsequently handled by Margaret J. Winkler and by the company Educational Pictures.

During summer Manbei sneaks out constantly to meet his old flame, a former mistress by the name of Sasaki Tsune (Chieko Naniwa). Sasaki has a grown-up, rather Westernized daughter Yuriko who may or may not be Manbei's own daughter. When Fumiko finds out Manbei has been seeing Sasaki again, she is angered and confronts her father, but Manbei denies the whole affair. The Kohayagawa family meets for a memorial service for their late mother at Arashiyama. After returning, Manbei has a heart attack but survives. Akiko asks Noriko about her matchmaking session with a man with a voracious appetite, but it appears Noriko is more inclined towards a friend Teramoto (Akira Takarada), a lecturer who has just moved to Sapporo as an assistant professor. In a secret trip out with Sasaki to and back from Osaka, Manbei has another heart attack, and dies shortly after. Sasaki informs the daughters of what happened. The ailing Kohayagawa brewery is to be merged with a business rival's, while Noriko decides to go to Sapporo to search out Teramoto.

Pre-Boom period  Since 1954 and until 1971 the Mexican economy performed very consistently, averanging 6% GDP growth each year and 3% inflation rate, allowing the country to sustain an exchange rate of 12.50 pesos per US dollar for 22 years (1954-1976). This period, called the \\"Mexican Economic Miracle\\" and \\"Stabilizing Development\\", consisted in an ISI model. By the late 1970s the economy faced certain limitations in the economic model, at the same time the United States were troubled with a rising trade deficit, sparking an international financial period of uncertainty. Mexico opted out to put more public money and investment to sustain fast growth. This was fuelling inflation as government spending was fully financed with new printed money. A devaluation in 1976 caused some panic until Petr√≥leos Mexicanos (PEMEX) discovered the Cantarell Field, boosting perspectives to exploit the soaring oil prices and the government decided to invest and change the economic model.  Oil Boom era  Between 1977 and 1981 PEMEX oil production grew almost twofold from 1.086 million bbd to 2.313 million bbd*, and net exports 5-fold from 0.197 million bbd to 1.154 million bbd*, this led to a 4-year 9.1% average growth in the GDP, and even as inflation crept up higher from a high base above 20% yearly, the massive job creation and rapid wage pace kept the workers mood calm. The expansion was mostly financed by loans and foreign money, as cheap credits from private banks and a blind faith from financiers allowed big sums of money to be invested easily, at the same time a free spending public sector began to invest in nearly anything within the nation. This money was trickling down to the broader economy and the private sector, the most benefited sectors were Construction, Mining and Transport, whose companies depending on private consumer also where in the free spending party, as result consumer goods imports soared 4.4 times* in 1981 from their 1977 level.  Oil price drop and consequences  When the world economy was hard hit by the interest rates hike from Paul Volcker in 1982 to stop inflation in the United States, those highly indebted nations like Mexico, which invested heavily to develop its field, were in crisis. Interest rates zoomed up dramatically at the same time oil demand and prices eased. The result was a gap of nearly 9% of the GDP in the national budget of 1982, turning Mexico in to default on their interest payments and finally signing up the commitments of the IMF, those financial commitments the government rejected back in 1976 when the fields were discovered. The effects of the budget cuts impacted the economy across the board, as the sale and privatization of the assets in the economy and job cuts pushed thousands of people out of work, government payroll shrank, and the ongoing restructuring of the private and public economy to face the new realities derived a series of reforms, aiming a growth dependent on trade, private investment and a bulk of sectors, this was called to cut the importance of the oil for the macroeconomy, and its dominance on the export earnings. Economic growth during the 1980s was nil, and the period is often called a \\"lost decade\\" for Mexico.

In 1979, Laura's mother Carrie, who has a mental illness and is being cared for in a psychiatric hospital, kills herself ‚Äì after Laura has been putting off going to see her. Laura is traumatized by her mother's death and is overwhelmed by guilt at not visiting her mother. She becomes paranoid and begins to have hallucinations of her mother.

In 1993, Kate Roberts begins to pay Laura visits at Pine Haven Sanitarium, where Laura has been transferred. Laura is very aware of what is going on around her, but remains in an apparent catatonic state because the crooked sanitarium workers are keeping her drugged in order to milk the Horton family of money.

Laura is released and slowly regains her life as she knew it. During the mid to late 1990s Laura was mostly known for her close friendship with Marlena, and her dislike for Marlena's rival Kristen Blake. During John and Kristen's relationship, Laura tried several times to convince John and Marlena that they belonged together, despite the fact that John was in a relationship with Kristen. In late 1996, Peter Blake is shot by Jack Deveraux, and Jack is then arrested for Peter's murder. However, Laura discovers that Peter is alive after seeing him in town, and Laura is then kidnapped by Stefano DiMera. Stefano then performs laser surgery on Laura's brain in order to erase her short-term memory. The surgery seems to have worked, however, Laura slowly begins to get her memories back and then convinces Marlena that Peter is in fact alive. Laura then, with the help of Marlena and Mike, begin to try and figure out where Peter is in order to exonerate Jack for Peter's murder. After discovering that Peter is alive, Laura, Mike, and Marlena also discover that it was Stefano and Kristen who kept Peter's whereabouts a secret. Then in 1997, Marlena is kidnapped by Kristen and held captive in a \\"secret room\\".

After John, Mike, and Abe attempt numerous searches in and around the DiMera house, they are convinced that Laura's schizophrenia is returning. Jennifer, along with her brother Mike, try to convince Laura to seek treatment, but Laura is adamant that there's nothing wrong with her and that Kristen and Stefano are in fact keeping Marlena captive inside the DiMera mansion. Soon after, Kristen gets herself locked in the same \\"secret room\\" that Marlena's in by Susan Banks, who had also discovered that Kristen had kidnapped Marlena. Susan, who now has seeming fallen madly in love with John as well, decides not to release Marlena from the secret room, but rather to keep her in there with Kristen. Susan then goes about pretending to be Kristen in order to marry John. On the day of John and Kristen's wedding, Laura snaps and decides to confront and attack Kristen (Not knowing that it is actually Susan). Whilst attacking \\"Kristen\\", Susan's false teeth falls out and lands in Vivian's martini, the truth is revealed and everyone, including Laura, realize that it's Susan pretending to be Kristen. Susan then tells John the truth about where Marlena and Kristen are, and John goes down to the cellar (to the secret room) and rescues both Marlena and Kristen. After being rescued, Kristen is adamant that the wedding should continue immediately, but is stopped by Marelna and Laura who expose all of Kristen lies in front of all of the wedding guests. In 1998, Laura is accused of murdering Kristen. But it was later revealed that the body was actually Susan Banks' sister Penelope Kent, and the killer was Susan's husband Edmund Crumb. Laura was then exonerated for the murder, however, her friendship with Marlena is in trouble because Marlena did not believe that Laura was innocent. After some time, Laura and Marlena reconcile, and their friendship is restored. Laura returns in 2003 for the wedding of her daughter and again in June 2010, along with her ex-husband, Bill Horton, after receiving news that Alice Horton was extremely ill. Along with many other family members, she was reunited with her daughter, Jennifer, and reminisced about the wonderful times they shared with Alice. Laura was not happy when she caught Bill talking to Kate at the Horton house, which showed she was still not over their past together. Bill reminded Laura that Alice didn't judge and would have welcomed Kate's visit. Several days later, she received news from Maggie Horton that Alice died in her sleep. In April 2013, Jennifer goes to visit Laura after having relationship problems in Salem. In 2016, Abigail Devereaux develops signs of schizophrenia and begins seeing visions of Ben. Laura, with the help of Andre Dimera manage to fake Abigail's death in order to help her get through her schizophrenia.

It is more intimate than stage magic because it doesn't require expensive, large-scale stage equipment and can thus be performed closer to the audience and without a stage. Many of the tricks performed by platform magicians are sufficiently angle-sensitive as to make them impossible to perform as micromagic. Most working magicians are parlor/platform magicians. Many magicians consider the term \\"parlor\\" to be old-fashioned and limiting, since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor, or even outdoors. According to the Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians by T.A. Waters, \\"The phrase [parlor magic] is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance.\\" Parlor, or stand-up, magicians generally work without assistants (unlike stage magicians, who may have several in their crew ‚Äì both backstage and on stage ‚Äì and may travel thousands of miles between jobs). Performances of this category of magic include civic and fraternal organizations, business groups, private parties, youth groups, church societies, public dinners, and similar venues. Common platform magic tricks include the \\"Miser's Dream\\" (where a seemingly endless supply of coins is produced from thin air), sucker tricks (like the \\"die box\\", where a giant die is put in a two-compartment box; the magician makes it vanish but the audience believe he simply shifts it to the other compartment; eventually the magician opens both sides of the box and the die is gone; it has appeared in a previously-empty hat); audience participation tricks (like the breakaway wand, where a wand remains rigid for the magician but falls apart every time the volunteer touches it); production effects (like the square circle, in which a bottomless, topless box with a screened front encloses a bottomless, topless cylinder. Both are shown empty and put together again; the magician then produces large quantities of silk scarves, fruit, bottles, and so on from the \\"empty\\" cylinder, inside the square box); and so on. There are countless effects that could be considered as fitting into this classification.

VPC runs a large direct mail program, sending voter registration materials to targeted voters. It also produces research material on demographic and voting trends. Between 2004 and 2020, they registered more than 4 million voters. Some election officials and campaigns have contested the group's methods of voter registration and voter turnout. Organization background In 2003, VPC was founded as Women's Voices Women Vote (WVWV) by Democratic political consultant Page Gardner as a nonpartisan project aimed at increasing the participation of unmarried women. Gardner announced she would step down from VPC effective November 15, 2020. WVWV was formed specifically to focus on the \\"marriage gap\\", and has promoted the term through its research, which determined that marital status is a key determinant of registration and voting, with unmarried women registering to vote and voting in elections at lower rates than married women. In 2008, the organization broadened its focus to include the other demographic groups that constitute what it calls the \\"Rising American Electorate\\" (RAE), while still retaining a particular interest in unmarried women. WVWV coined the term \\"Rising American Electorate\\" to refer to groups including unmarried women, people of color and young people who constitute a majority of voting eligible citizens. In 2011, Women's Voices Women Vote formally changed its name to the Voter Participation Center, to reflect a broadening of programmatic focus. The VPC's 501(c)4 sister organization, Women's Voices Women Vote Action Fund, continues to operate as the Center for Voter Information. The Center has partnered with national voting groups including Voto Latino. The organization says that it provides its research material, test findings and models to other local, state and national non- profit organizations interested in increasing voter participation among unmarried women, people of color and young people. VPC's tax forms show revenue of $26 million in 2019 and $4.9 million in assets. Activities The VPC's programs focus on increasing voter registration, turnout, awareness of issues and civic involvement of demographic groups including unmarried women, people of color and young people. Many VPC programs focus on unmarried women, as this group forms a large proportion of what the VPC terms the ‚Äúrising American electorate‚Äù and its research indicates that marital status is a key factor in determining civic participation. Since its inception in 2003, the VPC has focused its work on efforts to register 1 million voters. Its registration programs have largely focused on distributing applications to register by mail and encouraging their return, and reminding people to vote. Getting registrants to vote in an election is another focus of the organization. Its vote-by-mail programs are tested with a control group before being rolled out. WVWV has issued several reports commissioned from Lake Research Partners on the changing demographics of America, tracking the growth, socio-economic characteristics and voting behavior of unmarried women and other demographic groups. =2004 election= WVWV released its first two studies in March 2004, one in collaboration with pollsters Anna Greenberg and Stan Greenberg, the other with Celinda Lake. These studies found that single women register to vote and vote at a markedly lower rate than married women and that marital status is a top determinant in whether one registers and/or votes. They concluded that if unmarried women had voted at the same rates as married women in the 2000 election, the numbers would have been enough to have decidedly changed the outcome of the election in favor of Al Gore. In October 2004, actress Jennifer Aniston recorded a televised public service announcement for the group encouraging unmarried, separated, divorced and widowed women to register and to vote in the 2004 election. = 2006 election = In 2006 and 2010, WVWV partnered with the National Women's Law Center to create information sheets for women on voting topics relevant to them. = 2008 election = According to the VPC, in 2008, the organization generated slightly fewer than one million voter registration applications in 35 states. In 2007, in preparation for the 2008 presidential election, the organization launched a public service campaign in November 2007, featuring actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus in a replica of the Oval Office. The organization also produced the \\"Our First Time\\" campaign, which featured well-known women revealing the details of their first time voting. In addition to the commercials, the organization sent out mailings enclosing voter registration forms to unregistered single women voters and also carried out automated calls, informing them that they would receive such mailings. During the 2008 North Carolina Democratic Primary the group ran into legal trouble when it was reported by National Public Radio and the Center for Investigative Reporting that automated calls had been made to African-American voters providing confusing information, which may have misled voters to believe that they were not registered to vote. The robocalls did not identify the VPC as the caller. Attorney General Roy Cooper ordered the calls to stop, and the organization was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. In 2008, a number of VPC's vendor contracts were called into question after it was revealed that VPC had paid Integral Resources Inc. nearly $800,000 for phone services. Integral Resources Inc. is run by Ron Rosenblith, who is married to VPC president Page Gardner. VPC also paid several million dollars more on contracts with companies run by five additional members of the group's board of directors. = 2010 election = In addition, WVWV research has also documented obstacles to voter registration and election reforms best suited to improve voter registration and turnout numbers. According to WVWV research, some of the greatest barriers to voter participation include unnecessary rules limiting early and absentee voting, voter identification requirements, and inconsistent state regulations concerning voter lists and registration guidelines. In an effort to focus the attention of lawmakers and election reform groups on these obstacles, WVWV released a report titled, \\"Access to Democracy: Identifying Obstacles Hindering the Right to Vote\\". The VPC also focuses on educating policymakers and media on issues impacting what it calls the \\"Rising American Electorate\\", including a series of reports produced in March 2010, in partnership with the Center for American Progress. The VPC and CAP papers focused on the impact of legislative issues including healthcare, childcare, paycheck fairness and training in non-traditional professions on the economic security of unmarried women. Later that year, in October 2010, the organization released a joint study with Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research focusing on voting trends, which found that unmarried women favor Democratic candidates by a 67 percent to 28 percent margin. In comparison, the same study found that married women lean Republican by 52 percent to 40 percent. According to Page Gardner, the study's results suggest that there is not a traditional gender gap between men and women, but rather a gap between unmarried and married women. = 2012 election = In 2012, the Rising American Electorate constituted 115 million voters and 53.5% of the population. Republican election officials and the Mitt Romney campaign criticized VPC for sending mail to names and addresses that might not be able to register. But the Virginia State Board of Elections rejected a request from Romney's campaign to invalidate the VPC-generated voter registration applications.

Lopez defended VPC writing about this history of voter suppression in America and noting, \\"...focusing on these harmless errors to attack the efforts of the Voter Participation Center to bring more Americans into our democratic process does the organization an injustice.\\" = 2014 election = In 2014, VPC published a video featuring actresses Felicity Huffman and Rosario Dawson encouraging women to register and to vote. = 2016 election = In 2016, the group mailed 7.4 million registration forms to voters in 13 states, including 950,000 in Georgia. = 2018 election = In 2018, the group calculated that there are 142 million people in the Rising American Electorate, comprising 62 percent of the U.S. voting-eligible population. = 2020 election = The Voter Participation Center launched the largest voter campaign in its history in 2020, with a goal of registering 1 million voters. Ahead of the 2020 election, the group said it was mailing 5.4 million registration forms, including 520,000 in Pennsylvania. The group also conducted polling that found young people, people of color and unmarried women were likely to vote against Donald Trump, including a growing number of working class white women, many of whom voted for him in 2016. The group has also argued that aggressive deadlines for registering to vote disenfranchises many voters. Some election officials criticized the Center for its poor targeting of unregistered voters early in the 2020 election cycle on account of the already-registered or ineligible voters who received mailers. However, the Center president, Page Gardner, noted that only a small percentage of mailers were mistargeted, and some election officials have noted that the Center's campaign is much better at targeting voters than other similar efforts. Later in June 2020, the group again received criticism after sending pre-filled absentee ballot request forms to up to 80,000 North Carolinians. These absentee ballot request forms had sections already filled in, a practice banned in 2019 by the N.C. General Assembly. The N.C. State Board of Elections said that while CVI provided sample mailings to review, the \\"State Board staff did not catch the pre-filled forms at that time.\\" The Center announced that they would send out another 400,000 mailings that will include blank absentee ballot request forms, which are valid.

Loud music is music that is played at a high volume, often to the point where it disturbs others and/or causes hearing damage. It may include music that is sung live with one or more voices, played with instruments, or broadcast with electronic media, such as radio, CD, or MP3 players. Playing loud music that can be heard from outside of the property from where it is being played (such as a house, apartment, hotel room, or motor vehicle) is considered to be rude by many people and societies. Among those opposed to the practice, it may result in the loss of respect and possible legal action. But in certain contained settings, such as clubs or concerts, music is often played very loudly, but is viewed as acceptable. ConsequencesCriminal= Many jurisdictions have laws defining loud music as a criminal offense, typically a misdemeanor. The exact definition of what constitutes a loud music violation varies by location, either at a certain volume (measured in decibels) or the distance from the source at which the music can be heard. The time of day is also often a factor in the law, with the restrictions in some places applying only to specified nighttime hours (e.g. 11 PM-7 AM). The amount of effort put forth by law enforcement members in dealing with loud music also varies by location. The most common punishment for a conviction is a fine or some other small sanction. But on rare occasions, loud music may be grounds for imprisonment. In May 2008, a United Kingdom woman was sentenced to 90 days in jail for violating a court order not to play music that disturbed her neighbors eleven times. Police have also at times discovered other crimes, such as illegal drug usage, when investigating loud music complaints. Many public transportation services have rules against the use of sound-producing devices without earphones, or even with earphones if the music can be heard by others. Since mass transit agencies are frequently government-operated and/or subsidized, these rules can be legally enforced, and violation may result in prosecution. In 2014, software engineer Michael Dunn was convicted of first- degree murder after fatally shooting 17-year-old Jordan Davis in an altercation over the loud music Davis was playing. =Civil= Yellow paint on a piece of film wrap over a bass speaker playing very loud music. In many settings, loud music is not tolerated by property owners, and may be grounds for certain civil actions, such as eviction from rented property. Property owners at locations where patrons visit temporarily, such as hotels, campgrounds, or businesses, may order those who play loud music to leave the property. =Health= Continual exposure to loud music may result in hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has developed a set of recommendations aimed at protecting the hearing health of musicians and those who work in music and entertainment venues. Depending on the music sound levels and duration of exposure, as well as hearing protection used if any, the risk of hearing damage can vary significantly. Music played at 85 decibels, or level of sounds, for prolonged periods of times can cause hearing damage, for instance, sound levels at some rock concerts can reach 110-120 A-weighted decibels, and at those levels, the maximum daily limit set by most standards and regulations can be reached in less than one minute of exposure. Continual exposure to loud music can also lead to tinnitus. It is predicted that exposure to loud music will cause as many as 50 million Americans to suffer hearing loss by 2050.Aging Nation Faces Growing Hearing Loss, Aging U.S. Population Faces a Looming Crisis in Hearing Loss, Researchers Say - CBS News =Excessive drinking= A study conducted by French scientists showed that loud music leads to more alcohol consumption in less time. For three Saturday evenings researchers observed customers of two bars situated in a medium-sized city in the west of France. Participants included forty males aged between 18 and 25, who were unaware that they were subjects of a research. The study featured only those who ordered a glass of draft beer (25 cl. or 8 oz.). The lead researcher, Nicolas Gu√©guen, said that each year more than 70,000 people in France die from an increased level of alcohol consumption, which also leads to fatal car accidents.

He played a key role in organizing the Barbados labour movement and was a major figure in stimulating participation in the nation's political process. Frank Walcott was born in Saint Peter, and his policeman father died when Walcott was very young. He was raised in Bridgetown, where he attended Wesley Hall Boys' Secondary School, excelling in mathematics and debate from an early age. Becoming an active unionist in his mid-twenties, Walcott served the Barbados Workers' Union for over fifty years. He also served three separate terms as president of the Caribbean Congress of Labour, as well as serving in the Governing Body of the International Labour Organization and as Vice-President of the Executive Board of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. In addition to these posts, Walcott also served with the American Institute for Free Labour Development and was Chairman of the World Employment Conference. In politics, Walcott served as a Member of Parliament in the Barbados House of Assembly, from 1945 to 1966 and again from 1971 to 1976. He sat first as a member of the liberal Barbados Labour Party, but broke away from the party over its conservative beliefs to help establish the Democratic Labour Party in its movement towards independence and was a critical figure in its union and trade leanings. During the time between these terms he served as a Senator, and was President of that body from 1986 to 1991. After Barbados gained its independence in 1966, Walcott served as the nation's first Ambassador to the United Nations. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1954 Queen's Birthday Honours. In 1987 Walcott was conferred the highest honour in Barbados; he was made a Knight of St. Andrew (KA) of the Order of Barbados. The Sir Frank Walcott building in Saint Michael, Barbados, is named in his honour. Walcott is also noted for having been an exceptional cricket umpire.

The house was probably inherited in 1707 by Daggett's eldest surviving son, Joseph Daggett, a doctor of medicine, a wheelwright, and a miller. The farm is presumed to have been inherited by Joseph's son Israel, a cooper, in 1727. The house passed to various members of the Daggett family by inheritance or purchase, ending with Jefferson Daggett and his eldest son, Edwin O. Daggett. They continued to farm the property at least until 1870, when Jefferson died. The farm went into decline after the death of Jefferson Dagget, and was purchased as a \\"wornout farm\\" by the city in 1894.

Beliefs and meanings held by individuals and groups are supported by, and embedded in, sociocultural institutions and processes. Origins The term was coined by Peter L. Berger, who says he draws his meaning of it from the ideas of Karl Marx, G. H. Mead, and Alfred Schutz.Peter Berger, The Sacred Canopy - Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion (1967) p. 45 and p. 192 For Berger, the relation between plausibility structure and social \\"world\\" is dialectical, the one supporting the other which, in turn, can react back upon the first. Social arrangements may help, say, a certain religious world appear self-evident. This religious outlook may then help to shape the arrangements that contributed to its rise. Decline of religious plausibility Berger was particularly concerned with the loss of plausibility of the sacred in a modernist/postmodern world. Berger considered that history \\"constructs and deconstructs plausibility structures\\", and that the plurality of modern social worlds was \\"an important cause of the diminishing plausibility of religious traditions.\\"Peter Berger, A Rumour of Angels (1971) p. 121 and p. 61 Criticism Critics have argued that Berger pays too much attention to discourse analysis and not enough to the institutional frameworks that continue to support religious belief.Robert Wuthnow, Rediscovering the Sacred (1992) p. 30 Berger may also underestimate the role of self-selected reference groups in maintaining one's plausibility structures,E.

History Mount Mithridat was named after Mithridates VI of Pontus. He was ruler of the Kingdom of Pontus, and a long-time antagonist of the Roman Republic via the Mithridatic Wars, until he was deceived by his son. After a long siege of Panticapaeum he tried to kill himself several times, until finally was killed by the leader of his own guardsmen.

From 1983 to early 1984 he appeared three times as two different child characters - Speedboat, and Spencer Rutledge.See the IMDB reference here for details and dates. However, he is best remembered for the role of Fabian DeWitt, an impoverished black kid left to fend for himself by his mother, who was an alcoholic and drug-addicted prostitute. His case is championed by Sergeant Lucy Bates (played by Emmy winner Betty Thomas), who finally adopts Fabian. Zero Hubbard starred in this role from November 1984 until the program ended in 1987. Hubbard enjoyed a number of minor roles in other programs, none of which gave him the same exposure as Hill Street Blues. After Hill Street Blues ended, Hubbard had a limited number of small parts in American television programs, with his final TV credit in 2002.

The organisation also supports year- round activity in London. The organisation was founded by Rose Fenton and Lucy Neal, with the first festival in 1981 hoping to ‚Äòchallenge British theatre and open a window on the world‚Äô .Fenton, Rose and Lucy Neal. The turning world. London, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 2005. Page: 19. Lyn Gardner in The Guardian wrote of LIFT in 2014, \\"Probably no theatre organisation in the UK has done more to break down the distinctions between artforms than LIFT, which over the last 30 years has not only offered us a first glimpse of work by world-class theatre makers, but also offered space for first-hand theatrical dispatches from artists living with conflict and under oppression who find space denied them in their own country.\\" LIFT's current artistic director is Kris Nelson. History Rose Fenton and Lucy Neal founded LIFT as young graduates from Warwick University. The first international festival of theatre in England, they quickly developed support in the face of much adversity, gaining several trustees and high-profile patrons such as Peter Ustinov and Lady Molly Daubeny, (the widow of Sir Peter Daubeny founder of World Theatre Seasons). Sue Arnold, a regular columnist at The Observer, impressed by the hard work of Fenton and Neal, wrote: \\"if the Festival is not a phenomenal success I shall eat an entire millinery collection without demur\\".Sue Arnold, Observer, 1 July 1981 The first festival in 1981 saw artists from Brazil, Poland, Malaysia, Japan and Holland perform in venues across London, alongside British artists. The performances presented in the festival had never been seen in the UK before and were experimental and political in nature.Fenton, Rose and Lucy Neal. The turning world. London, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 2005 LIFT continued to grow as a festival and in significance with a biennial Festival programmed by Fenton and Neal from 1981‚Äì2001. During this time they brought some of the world's most important theatre-makers, found emergent artists from countries all over the globe and produced spectacular events across London with international and national artists such as Les Comedients and Christophe Berthonneau. LIFT premiered Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden, experimented with the form of theatre with pieces such as the labyrinth show Oraculos and commissions such as Deborah Warner's St Pancras Project, Bobby Baker's Grown-Up School and Theatre-Rites' House. Fenton and Neal also first brought significant international theatre-makers such as Robert Lepage, Romeo Castellucci and De La Guarda to the UK for the first time. From 2001 they launched the 'LIFT Enquiry' to open up spaces to discuss the purpose and possibilities of theatre and festivals at the start of the new millennium. This saw LIFT break away from the structure of a biennial festival and program international and national artists as part of smaller seasons of work alongside workshops, talks, residencies and projects. In 2004, after 25 years, Fenton and Neal announced they would be stepping down as directors of the Festival. Angharad Wynne-Jones was appointed director of the festival, and oversaw the LIFT 2008 festival before Mark Ball was appointed artistic director in 2009. Since then, LIFT has returned to its biennial format with festivals in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018.  Most recent festival LIFT 2018= LIFT 2018 took place from 25 May and ran until 22 July. The festival programme included 17 productions, 10 of which are commissions or co- commissions, 5 world premieres and 8 UK premieres. One of these is SESSION, a Tottenham original production involving young dancers, live afrobeats music, designers and musicians which will take place in Bernie Grant Arts Centre. American playwright and actress Anna Deavere Smith returned to the Royal Court Theatre for her first London appearance in 25 years with Notes From The Field, her Obie-award-winning play which tells the story of the students, parents, teachers and staff caught up in America's school-to-prison pipeline.  Recent festivals LIFT 2010= LIFT 2010 (19 June-17 July) was a presentation of theatre from the Middle East and North Africa, such as Aftermath in The Old Vic Tunnels and Hobb Story. Also, with seven UK premieres and five shows new to London, LIFT 2010 included new work from Dutch theatre-maker Dries Verhoeven, who linked audiences at the National Theatre live to performers in Sri Lanka, Israel's Nalaga'at Theatre, the world's only professional company of deaf blind performers, a weekend of social game playing on an international theme from Hide&Seek;, and a new symphony for ice cream vans by the composer and theatre-maker Dan Jones. =2011 LIFT‚Äôs 30th Birthday= LIFT took part in ShubbakShubbak with two productions from Egypt and Lebanon. It also hosted 20 young festival producers from across Europe in a three-day training academy as part of the Festlab initiative. Luke Jerram's Sky Orchestra sent seven hot air balloons that took off at dawn and flew over London with a melody specially created by composer Dan Jones. In addition, LIFT spent 2011 working with seven schools across London exploring the possibilities of theatre through the LIFT Living Archive and using the Olympic Games as a catalyst to create their own special event. And also joined forces with Homo Novus in Riga, Latvia and Newcastle's Wunderbar to create Distance, a roaming performance festival that explored the relationship with distance. =LIFT 2012= LIFT 2012 (12 June-15 July) included 21 productions from 15 different countries in a five-week festival of international theatre, seen by over 43,000 audience members. The festival went to the West End for the first time in its history with Elevator Repair Service's Gatz, that \\"beautifully captures the elegiac tone of the book with its sense of the dissolving, essentially agrarian American Dream\\".Billington, Michael \\"Gatz - review\\", 14 June 2012, The Guardian. It also established a partnership with the Royal Shakespeare Company's World Shakespeare Festival, co-commissioning three new international productions from dreamthinkspeak, Iraqi Theatre Company and Artistes, Producteurs, Associ√©s. LIFT 2012 continued to feature artists from the Middle East and the Arab world, as well as artists from Iran, with Unfinished Dream by Hamid Pourazari; Belarus, with Minsk 2011 by Belarus Free Theatre; and Brazil, with The Dark Side of Love by Renato Rocha. =LIFT 2013= While working on the LIFT 2014 festival, the organisation maintained its cultural programme as producer, commissioner and partnership of networks such as House on Fire, Imagine 2020 and Festival in Transition or Live art UK. The main activity during those months was to focus on giving support to small or medium size companies which LIFT had worked with before like the Belarus Free Theatre that presented its new project Trash Cuisine. Also, LIFT worked in close collaboration with Derry-Londonderry, 2013 City of the Culture Political Mother: Derry-Londonderry Uncut, a re-working of Hofesh Shechter Company's work Political Mother: Choreographer's cut supporting 12 Derry musicians to join the band for the performance. Working with dancers from Hofesh Shechter Company and 5 local dance groups LIFT producer Political Mother: Shortcuts, a series of sigh specific dance pieces performed in the city of Derry created in response to the themes and dance vocabulary of Political Mother. Whilst in Derry LIFT also worked with Boat Magazine to produce a limited edition newspaper version of their nomadic magazine about the people, culture and life of the city. Finally, LIFT organised a conference on how artists respond to archives ‚ÄòPast Is The Prologue‚Äô, and a festival hack where developers, programmers, coders and artists came together to create prototype digital projects responding to the themes of LIFT. = LIFT 2014 = LIFT 2014 was the 20th edition of LIFT. In the brochure for the 2014 Festival, Artistic Director Mark Ball wrote: 'LIFT 2014 platforms a gorgeous diversity of work that wouldn't otherwise be seen in London. Without sounding overzealous, we believe that much of this work is political and engages with the big ideas of our times: freedom, justice, and environmental and technological change. Whether it's thinking about the history of censorship in the Soviet Union, the impact of global warming or the distribution of water, the work is eye-opening, witty and entertaining, with dollops of music, visual culture and animated debate thrown into the mix.' The festival, which began on 2 June, hosted 30 productions from 13 countries that played in 14 venues across London. The programme included The Roof a three-dimensional free-running performance and A Journey on Foot at Dusk which invited audiences to participate in a Haitian- inspired funeral procession. The 2014 festival saw the beginning of a collaboration with artists from South-America with productions from Brazilian choreographer Bruno Beltrao, Brazilian director Renato Rocha and Argentinian Lola Arias whose The Year I was Born was based around the stories of people who grew up under the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. =LIFT 2016= LIFT 2016 ran from 1 June until 2 July with a debut performance from Taylor Mac. The festival programme included 25 productions, 6 of which were commissions or co-commissions. One of these was Depart, a Circa production involving circus artists, choral singers, designers and musicians and took place in Tower Hamlets cemetery park. British playwright and director Neil Bartlett was commissioned to write Stella, which takes one half on the Victorian cross- dressing duo Fanny and Stella as its subject and saw Hoxton Hall become a LIFT venue for the very first time. The festival events also included talks with The Wooster Group and Peter Brook and for the first time involved the UpLIFTers from LIFT Tottenham who became an official festival Jury as part of The Children's Choice Awards.  LIFT Tottenham  LIFT Tottenham began in January 2015, the programme works in and around Tottenham, collaborating with local artists, young people and organisations in the area to produce art work with a particular focus on participatory work engaging non-professional performers with arts opportunities. = Tottenham Artist Hangout = LIFT's first artist gathering was held in March 2015 at the Bernie Grants Arts Centre.

Griffith and starring Margaret Sullavan, James Stewart and Ray Milland. The adapted screenplay was by Melville Baker, with an uncredited Preston Sturges and Doris Anderson, based on Ursula Parrott's 1935 novel Next Time We Live, which was serialized before publication as Say Goodbye Again. The film is also known as Next Time We Live in the U.K. Plot Aspiring actress Cicely Tyler (Margaret Sullavan) marries ambitious newsman Christopher Tyler (James Stewart), but their life together is interrupted when he is assigned to a good position in his newspaper's Rome bureau, and she stays behind, confiding to her rich secret admirer, Tommy Abbott (Ray Milland), that she is pregnant. Separations, reunions and reconciliations follow as Cicely and Christopher struggle to balance their romance and their careers.Erickson, Hal Plot synopsis (Allmovie)IMDB Overview Cast *Margaret Sullavan as Cicely Tyler *James Stewart as Christopher Tyler *Ray Milland as Tommy Abbott *Grant Mitchell as Michael Jennings *Anna Demetrio as Madame Donato *Robert McWade as Frank Carteret *Ronnie Cosby as Kit at Age Eight *Hattie McDaniel as Hannah (uncredited) Production Ursula Parrott was a popular novelist of the time, several of whose novels were turned into films, most prominently Ex-Wife which became the 1930 movie The Divorcee. The story which provided the source material for Next Time We Love was first serialized as Say Goodbye Again in McCall's from December 1934 to April 1935, and was then published as a novel called Next Time We Live, which was also the working title of the film. There was debate about what to call the movie, with studio executives concerned that a motion picture entitled Next Time We Live might be misinterpreted as being about reincarnation, while director Edward H. Griffith wanted to avoid losing the publicity value of using the novel's title. Although the film was released as Next Time We Love, the alternate title Next Time We Live was used for its British release.TCM Notes Francis Lederer was originally cast for the part of Christopher Tyler, but was unavailable. Margaret Sullavan was responsible for suggesting her friend James Stewart might be borrowed from MGM for the part. Production on the film was delayed because Sullavan was shooting retakes for So Red the Rose, but it began on 21 October 1935 and continued through 30 December.TCM Overview Shooting began with only half the script written by Melville Baker, so three weeks into production, the studio put Doris Anderson on the project as well. Some scenes in the film were directed in San Francisco by assistant director Ralph Slosser using doubles, and Slosser also directed some studio scenes as well. Next Time We Love was released at the end of January 1936.

The fa√ßade features a large tower on one side and a smaller tower on the other, flanking the entranceway. A large lancet window dominates the fa√ßade and a gabled vestibule fronts the gabled entrance. The exterior has been extensively altered from its original appearance. The structure of the church is brick, but in 1915 the exterior was completely covered in Formstone, a cast concrete made to resemble limestone. The interior of the church is High Victorian Gothic in design, painted white and gold with elaborate Gothic woodwork. The lighting system is historically significant, and the church features a Votteler organ.

Blakely produced several kit car models, the Bantam, Bearcat, and Bernardi. History Blakely Auto was founded by Dick Blakely to market affordable sports cars in the spirit of the legendary Lotus Seven: compact, lightweight, and with excellent handling.Mike Knepper, \\"Blakely Bearcat & Bantam\\", Road & Track November 1975 The Bantam was Blakely's first offering. It was followed by the larger Bearcat and eventually by the Bernardi. The founder had a degree in mechanical engineering and had been involved in oval track racing prior to designing the Bantam. His goal with the initial design was to maximize performance while minimizing size, weight, accessories, and other features that might conflict with acceleration and handling. Blakely took inspiration from an early model of the British Dutton Cars, itself a Lotus Seven replica.p 126, The Complete Guide to Kit Cars, Auto Parts and Accessories. R. M. Kutner, 1979: Auto Logic, Wilmington, Delaware, USA. After building the first car for himself, Blakely found sufficient interest from other auto enthusiasts to warrant building more cars of the same design. Partnering with Denny Myelle, Blakely began to produce the Bantam as a kit and also to develop a new, larger car that was more versatile and suited to off-track use. This second model became the Bearcat and later developed into the Bernardi. For both models, a key design goal was use of a single donor automobile. Designs based on a single donor simplify the build process. The car Blakely selected was the Ford Pinto, with the option to use parts from close relatives like the Mercury Bobcat and the Ford Mustang. This family of donor vehicles gave the Blakely cars rack-and-pinion steering, front disk brakes, and a good selection of engine choices. For the chassis, Blakely Auto provided a frame of box steel tubing, custom front upper A-arms for the suspension, new shocks, and instructions for modifying and attaching the remaining chassis components from the donor car. Blakely Auto also supplied a full replacement body, including the body tub, doors, hood, fenders, trunk, convertible or hard top, and windshield. Around 1979, ownership of the company transferred to Art Herschberger.Jim Plegue, \\"The Blakely Bernardi: Helping to rid the world of old Pintos\\", Autoweek 28 September 1981 In the Spring of 1979 he moved production from Davis Junction, Illinois to Princeton, Wisconsin.Gerald Perkins, Owner of last car produced out of Davis Junction. The early 1980s saw development and production of the Bernardi, a significant modification of the Bearcat model. In 1985, the company was renamed the Bernardi Auto Works.p 126, The Big Guide to Kit and Specialty Cars. Harold W. Pace, 1979: The Big Car Book Company, Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The business appears to have shut down in the late 1980s. Blakely automobiles still appear for sale in various specialist auto markets, but no new ones are being manufactured. Major products * Bantam. The Bantam was similar to the Lotus Seven in size and drivetrain, although it used a slightly boxed-in ladder frame instead of the space frame favored by Lotus. It was intended primarily for track use, and was designed for light weight by avoiding inessentials such as doors, roof, or movable seats. The compact body and frame suited a small, straight-four engine choice like the Ford 1.6, 2.0, or 2.3 liter offering. Production of the Bantam continued into the 1980s, when the model was renamed the Hawk. * Bearcat. This model had a unique appearance, not closely modeled on any of the classic sports cars usually providing inspiration to kit car designers. It was larger and twenty percent heavier than the Bantam, but much better suited to regular street use by virtue of its more spacious cab, adjustable seats, doors, removable hard- and soft-top roofs, rear trunk, and wider variety of possible engines. This model was the eponymous \\"star\\" of The Car, a novel. * Bernardi. The Bernardi had the size and comfort provisions of the Bearcat, but a moderate exterior redesign made it resemble the 1950s British MG TD. Engine options included the four-cylinder choices of the Bantam, as well as the Ford 2.8 liter V6.Jean Lindamood, \\"Blakely Bernardi\\", Car & Driver February 1981 The broader hood even made it feasible to install the 5.0 liter (302 c.i.) V8 engine used in the Ford Mustang II.

Le Guin, published in 2008. It relates the life of Lavinia, a minor character in Virgil's epic poem the Aeneid. Synopsis Lavinia, daughter of the king of the Latins of Laurentum, is sought after by neighbouring kings, but knows she is destined to marry a stranger. This is Aeneas from the Trojan War, who arrives with a large body of Trojans. An agreement is made but then breaks down and there is war, which is won by the outnumbered Trojans. They found a new city called Lavinium, but Aeneas is killed after three years. Aeneas's elder son Ascanius founds Alba Longa and marries but fails to produce an heir. Lavinia removes her son Silvius from his control and he eventually becomes king of the Latins. Rome already exists, but as a small settlement that plays no part in events. Lavinia herself retreats from the world and at the end seems to have turned into an owl. She has all along regarded the world she lives in as unreal, a product of Virgil's imagination. Background The book is based on the last six books, or the Iliadic half, of the Aeneid. Throughout the novel, Lavinia holds conversations with \\"the poet,\\" the shade of a dying Virgil. In this way, the novel forms a relationship to the original it adapts in the matters of its plot and through the ways that Lavinia's character relates to the poet and his poem. It seems Lavinia only exists in the context of the poem, and through her conversations with the poet, she is self-aware of her own textuality. This novel is not meant to be history. Le Guin says that \\"The Trojan War was probably fought in the thirteenth century BC; Rome was founded, possibly, in the eighth, though there is no proper history of it for centuries after that. That Priam's nephew Aeneas of Troy had anything at all to do with the founding of Rome is pure legend, a good deal of it invented by Virgil himself\\".Afterword to Lavinia. She also explains that her work is a translation of the last six books of the Aeneid into prose. Interview with Le Guin on The Inkwell Review, on her novel Lavinia. Le Guin's thinking about Lavinia as a translation demonstrates that Le Guin has a nuanced theory of translation. She adds much to Virgil's epic poem, but carries across much of Virgil's poetry and the world of the Aeneid in doing so.

Now a small public park, it is the place where the La V√©rendrye brothers, the first known Europeans to explore this area, placed a lead plate bearing the crest of France, to claim the territory for their homeland, during their 1742-43 expedition to the Rocky Mountains. This site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1991. A monument has been erected at the site to explain the history. Setting The Verendrye Site occupies a low hill overlooking the western bank of the Missouri River, which flows south between Fort Pierre and Pierre. It is accessed via a paved drive from Verendrye Drive to the north. A small circular turnaround has a few spaces for parking, and the noted monument is directly adjacent. The marker is made of granite and stands about high. It bears this inscription: Here on // March 30, 1743 // The Verendryes // Buried a lead // tablet to claim // this region for // France. This // tablet found // on Feb. 16, 1913, is // the first written // record of the // visit of white // men to // South Dakota. In smaller type, the inscription continues: Erected by // State Historical // Society // and Ft. Pierre // Commercial Club // 1933. History Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La V√©rendrye was a leading explorer for New France, and with his four sons he led many early exploratory expeditions into the northern plains of North America. By the 1730s, the V√©rendryes had established several trading posts in what are now North Dakota and Canada. Their expedition of 1742-43 sought to extend the range of influence further west, with an ultimate goal of reaching the Pacific Ocean. In this they were unsuccessful. They are believed to have explored into present-day Montana and Wyoming, but there is significant scholarly debate about exactly which Native American peoples they encountered and where they went. The brothers leading the expedition (probably Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La V√©rendrye and Fran√ßois de La V√©rendrye, but sources of the expedition are ambiguous) documented the secret placement of a 8 1/2\\" by 6 1/2\\" lead plate bearing the French coat of arms and text in Latin about the King of France on a bluff overlooking the Missouri. They told the local Native Americans that the cairn they built over the site was a memorial of their passage, but it marked their claim of the territory for France. The lead plate was rediscovered in 1913 by children playing on the eroding hillside. It is now held by the state historical society, and the city has preserved the site as a park. A 4-foot monument was erected in 1933 at the site by the state historical society and local chamber of commerce, marking it for its historical interest. Flags of the US, France and South Dakota are flown here. The area has been explored for archeological artifacts. Discovery of the plate has enabled scholars of the late 20th and early 21st centuries to clarify some aspects of the expedition's travels. The commemorative granite marker was placed in 1933.

Sakoa Coal Field The Sakoa Coal Field is in the southwest of Madagascar and coal was first discovered in the area in 1908. Small-scale mining was undertaken during World War II. Drilling results indicate that the field is large with a seam measuring up to thick in places. The product is a thermal coal similar in specification to coal currently being exported by South Africa and is likely to be used in power plants in India and Western Europe. It was estimated in 2015 that 200 million tonnes of coal are recoverable from the field, with an estimated potential resource tonnage of over one billion tonnes. It is expected that the coal will mostly be mined by the open pit method, and that extraction will initially be at the rate of five million tonnes per year.

The site contains the remains of a Native American Plains village which has been tentatively dated to about 1300 AD. Despite the fact that site is subject to erosive destruction from wave action on the lake, has been determined likely to yield significant information about the movements and living patterns of prehistoric Native Americans in the region. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997. Description and history This site was first identified in the early 20th century as being of archaeological interest, but its location was mis-described several times before its first format evaluation in 1979. At that time, the site was identified as containing 22 depressions indicative of house rings, as well as evidence of trash pits and a midden. Field work resulted in the collection of more than 200 pieces of ceramic remains, stone chips consisting with tool work, projectile points and other stone tools, as well as the remains of bison and other fauna. The site is part of a complex of sites in the middle reaches of the Missouri River that are believed to constitute the largest assemblage of agrarian prehistoric settlements of the period in North America. The site was visited again by archaeologists in 1990 and 1993, primarily to assess its condition in the context of repeated erosion events caused by changing water levels in the lake.

The term Glenbard is a portmanteau of Glen Ellyn and Lombard, the two predominant towns of the district. History Glenbard Township High School was truly established in the 1922-1923 school year when students began their first full year of attendance on the campus of what is now Glenbard West High School. Students in Glen Ellyn had previously attended the Glen Ellyn High School, which was located on the second floor of the DuPage Bank Building. This school was founded in 1916 with Mr. A. W. Holzman as Principal. When Mr. Fred L. Biester took over the office in 1918, the faculty consisted of five members who instructed 120 students in a basic curriculum. By 1920, the enrollment had far outgrown the bank building and the various church basements that had been called into service. A search began for a building site. \\"Honeysuckle Hill\\" was then purchased for the new high school. After the site had been chosen, Lombard asked to be included in the Glen Ellyn district. The two communities combined their efforts, and Glenbard High School was born. Prior to the opening of Glenbard East in 1959, Lombard students in High School District No. 87 attended Glenbard West in Glen Ellyn (known at the time simply as Glenbard High School). The first Superintendent to serve the district was the late Fred L. Biester, who was Superintendent from 1918 until his death in 1962. In the spring of 1962, the Board of Education appointed Dr. Dean W. Stoakes as Superintendent, followed by Mr. Raymond Livingston in 1978 and Dr. Robert C. Stevens in 1984. Dr. Ron Smith was appointed as superintendent in May 1999. In 2002, Dr. Timothy Hyland was appointed superintendent. Dr. Mike Meissen was superintentendent from 2006 until June 2012. Dr. David Larson became superintendent in July 2012 Glenbard East High School opened its doors in September 1959. Glenbard North High School opened its doors in August 1968. Glenbard South High School opened its doors to students for the first time in the fall of 1972. Member schools District 87 consists of four high schools. The four schools all share the name Glenbard, with each school named after a different cardinal direction. =Glenbard East High School= Glenbard East is located in Lombard, Illinois. The school's mascot is the Ram. Its feeder schools include Westlake Middle School (Lombard) and Marquardt Middle School (Glendale Heights). Established in 1959, Glenbard East has a long tradition of prominence in the areas of arts and music. Under the leadership of Department chair Ross Kellan, with the submission from Orchestra Director Joanne May, the G.E. music program won a Grammy award in 2000. =Glenbard North High School= Glenbard North is located in Carol Stream, Illinois. The school's current principal is John Mensik. The school‚Äôs mascot is the panther. Its feeder schools are Jay Stream Middle School and Stratford Middle School (both from District 93) as well as Glenside Middle School (which is in District 16), in Glendale Heights. It has about 3000 students. Its school newspaper is The North Current, which is a member of the High School National Ad Network. The school is usually solid in several sports, including Wrestling, Girls Softball, Girls Track and Field, and Football. =Glenbard South High School= Glenbard South is located in Glen Ellyn, Illinois.

The football team went 18-6 from 2008‚Äì2009 and reached the quarterfinals in the playoffs both years. In 2013, its football team went undefeated in the regular season and made it to the second round of the IHSA playoffs in 2013, 2014 and 2015. =Glenbard West High School= Glenbard West is located in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. The mascot are the Hilltoppers. The 1991 television documentary Yearbook was filmed there. It was also featured in the book The Girl Who Owned A City by O.T. Nelson. Large portions of the 1986 film Lucas (film) were shot in and around the school. The school is known for their main building resembling a castle, and the fact that the school is atop a hill, hence their school's sports team name, the Hilltoppers. The main junior high to feed into West is Hadley Junior High and Glenside Middle School, with students from other schools in the area. Girls and Boys Gymnastics have been very successful recently. In addition, the Forensics (Speech) team, led by Tony Crowley, is generally regarded as one of the best in the state.

Korobov in the 1960s. The weapons were gas operated with annular gas piston located around the barrel and a vertically moving bolt, which made it possible to minimise the length of the receiver group. A U-shaped rammer/extractor was used to chamber and extract the cartridge by pushing it into the chamber where after discharge was pulled back from the chamber and again, upon feeding the new cartridge, pushed forward and slightly up into an ejection tube above the barrel where finally exiting above the muzzle. Due to this ejection mechanism it was possible to fire from both right and left arm positions. These weapons had the best barrel length to overall length ratio among the assault rifles. Firing from an unstable position, the TKB-022PM No. 1 and the TKB-022PM No. 2 had a three times better accuracy than the AKM. The TKB-022PM5 No. 1 had a better accuracy than the AKM when fired from a hand in a lying position at a distance of 100 meters. Although these assault rifles performed well, they were turned down by the Soviet army for being too radical at that time.

We made friendships at those early conferences, friendships that continue decades later.‚Äùi Because the 1984 conference was so successful, at the AALS conference on Legal Writing held at Chicago-Kent in 1985, 15 individuals from 14 law school decided to establish what is now the Legal Writing InstituteThe first meeting of the Legal Writing Institute was held on Saturday, March 23, 1985, in Chicago. Fifteen persons were selected to be members of the first Board of Directors of the Legal Writing Institute at that first meeting:14 James Bond, Wake Forest University School of Law; Susan Brody, John Marshall School of Law; Lynne Capehart, University of Florida College of Law; Daisy Floyd, University of Georgia School of Law; Ellen Mosen James, City University of New York Law School at Queens; Noel Lyon, Queens University Faculty of Law; Christine Metteer, Southwestern University School of Law; Michele Minnis, University of New Mexico School of Law; Laurel Currie Oates, University of Puget Sound School of Law; Teresa Phelps, Notre Dame Law School; Chris Rideout, University of Puget Sound School of Law; Renee Hausman Shea, Law School Admissions Council; Chris Simoni, Willamette University College of Law; Jim Stratman, Carnegie-Mellon University; Christine Woolever, Northeastern University School of Law.. The following year, the Institute was incorporated as a non-profit organization with its home at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington.  Conferences  Since 1984, the Institute has sponsored biennial conferences, the most recent ones attracting more than 500 participants. While originally the conferences were held at the University of Puget Sound or its successor, Seattle University, the conferences now rotate among different regions of the county and are held at different law schools or conference sites. The next conference will be held at Georgetown University Law Center in July 2020. The Institute also hosts one-day conferences every December and, since 2007, the Institute has co-hosted the Applied Legal Storytelling conference, which is held in years in which there is no biennial conference. These conferences have as their focus applied narrative theory and storytelling on behalf of clients  The Second Draft  Because there was no email or listservs, in 1986 the Institute started a newsletter, The Second Draft,The name, The Second Draft, was suggested by J. Denny Haythorn, Director of the Law Library and Professor of Law at Whittier College School of Law. In suggesting the name, Professor Haythorn wrote that the name ‚Äúindicates a draft of our work, not the first or the last, but merely our progress toward our goal....‚Äù Members agreed with Professor Haythorn, and, because they thought the name reflected what it wanted this newsletter to be, a place where members could share work in progress, they adopted his suggestion. which Professor Laurel Currie Oates edited. The Second Draft, which started as a collection of photocopied articles and announcements, is now an online publication sent by email to all Institute members twice a year. Each issue of The Second Draft collects essays related to a central theme. Past themes have included methodologies for teaching analysis in the classroom, different approaches to commenting on students' writing, and incorporating technology into the legal writing and research classroom.  Listserv  During the 1994 Legal Writing conference, Professor Ralph Brill of Chicago-Ken established a listserv so that those attending the conference could share ideas more easily. Today, the listserv is open to all persons interested in the teaching of Legal Writing and is an extremely active listserv. The listserv address is LWRPROF-L@iupui.edu.  Legal Writing, the Journal of the Legal Writing Institute  In 1998, the Institute established a journal to showcase the developing discipline of legal writing. The Journal‚Äôs mission is to provide a forum for the publication of scholarly articles about the theory, substance, and pedagogy of legal writing. Unlike most law reviews, which are student-edited, the Journal is peer-reviewed. The editorial board is composed of faculty from law schools across the country and includes some of the leading scholars and academics in the field of legal writing. Although originally called the Journal of the Legal Writing Institute, the Journal is now called Legal Writing, the Journal of the Legal Writing Institute.  Survey  Under the leadership of Professor Jill Ramsfield, in 1990 the Institute developed and sent out the first survey collecting information about Legal Writing programs and staffing. The survey continues to evolve and the information that has been collected has provided institutions with invaluable information about how legal writing is taught at various institutions and about the status of those who teach legal writing.  Advocacy  In 2015, the Institute established the Professional Status Committee and charged it with the task of gathering information about status issues; acting as a resource for Institute members, and assisting Board in addressing status issues and their effect on its members. In 2015, LWI adopted the following statement: No justification exists for subordinating one group of law faculty to another based on the nature of the course, the subject matter, or the teaching method. All full-time law faculty should have the opportunity to achieve full citizenship at their institutions, including academic freedom, security of position, and governance rights. Those rights are necessary to ensure that law students and the legal profession benefit from the myriad perspectives and expertise that all faculty bring to the mission of legal education. Both the Association of Legal Writing Directors (ALWD) and the Society of American Law Teachers (SALT) have also adopted this statement.

The film is a sound remake of the 1926 silent movie, The Sea Beast, which also starred Barrymore. It is the first adaption film of Herman Melville's 1851 novel Moby Dick which includes a soundtrack. Plot The film tells of a sea captain's maniacal quest for revenge on a great white whale that has bitten off his leg. Ahab meets and falls in love with Faith, the daughter of the local minister, after disembarking in New Bedford. She falls in love with him and is heartbroken when he leaves on another voyage, but says she will wait three years for him to return. During this next voyage, Ahab loses his leg to Moby Dick, a white whale. When Ahab returns to New Bedford, he mistakenly believes that the woman he loves no longer wants to see him due to his disfigurement, an opinion encouraged by Ahab's brother, who wants Faith for himself. Ahab vows revenge against the whale, and to kill it or be killed in the process, and returns to sea. Eventually, Ahab raises enough capital to buy and be captain of his own ship, but no one wants to crew with him because of his passion for destroying Moby Dick. Nonetheless, he directs his first mate to shanghai a crew‚Äîand unknowingly takes his brother on board. Although the crew mutinies, Moby Dick is sighted, and Ahab heads the harpoon boats out to spear him; driven with a bloodlust, he harpoons Moby Dick and kills him. The crew boils him down for whale oil, and they return to New Bedford, where Ahab and Faith are reunited.

Established in 1832 by Pierre Chouteau, Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri, whose family were major fur traders, this facility operated through the 1850s. It was for many years the largest trading post in the northern Great Plains and a major trans-shipment point for buffalo furs. The archaeological remains of the fort, located in Stanley County just north of the town of Fort Pierre, were declared a National Historic Landmark in 1991. Setting Fort Pierre on the Missouri. Painting by Karl Bodmer, who visited the fort in 1833. View from the plains. Fort Pierre, South Dakota, 1857. Engraving of the trading post from a painting by General Alfred Sully. View from across the Missouri. Fort Pierre Chouteau was located just north of the confluence of the Missouri and Bad rivers, on a low terrace above the west bank of the Missouri River. This site was of strategic importance for several reasons. It served as a midpoint among the outposts of the American Fur Company (AFC), which monopolized trade on the upper Missouri by 1830, and as an endpoint for a major overland shipment route to Fort Laramie in present-day eastern Wyoming. This fort was built as a replacement for Fort Tecumseh, located on what is now LaFramboise Island closer to the river confluence. The island fort had been built in 1817 by the Columbia Fur Company, the AFC's predecessor in the regional fur trade. That fort was poorly sited and subject to flooding from the river. Some of its timber elements were reused in the construction of Fort Pierre Chouteau. History The first people of European descent to encounter Native Americans in the Fort Pierre area were a pair of French explorers, the La V√©rendrye brothers, during their 1743‚Äì44 expedition. They buried an inscribed lead plate on a hill near the confluence of the Missouri and Bad Rivers, claiming the territory for the King as part of New France. The next major non-native visitors were members of the American Lewis and Clark Expedition, who camped in the area in 1806. They were commissioned by the United States government to explore and survey major areas of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. In 1817 trader Joseph La Framboise, Jr., son of parents from Quebec and Ontario who were fur traders in the region, established a French-Canadian trading post here. His mother was M√©tis and took over the post in Michimilimackinac, Michigan after her husband's death. The development of the trading post marked the start of permanent white settlement of the Missouri/Bad River area. In 1822, former fur traders for the privately held, British Hudson's Bay Company established the Columbia Fur Company in competition. They built Fort Tecumseh as well as other outposts on the Upper Missouri. In 1827 John Jacob Astor through his American Fur Company, a near monopoly, purchased the assets of the Columbia Fur Company. The AFC turned management of the Upper Missouri Operation (UMO) over to Bernard Pratte and Pierre Chouteau, Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri. When Chouteau ascended the Missouri River in 1832 on the maiden voyage of the steamship Yellowstone, he ordered construction of what was formally dubbed Fort Pierre in his honor. Astor retired from the fur business in 1834, and Chouteau purchased the Fort Pierre operation. He eventually bought out Pratte and became the principal operator of this post and its fur trade. Fort Pierre and the surrounding community rapidly developed as a major center for Chouteau's trading business. In addition to its central location for company logistics, it was also generally surrounded by a settlement of Lakota Sioux and other Plains Indian tribes, who traded buffalo furs for American and European goods. At its height in the 1850s, the company was part of a complex trading network extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Eastern United States and Europe: it shipped 100,000 fur robes through Fort Pierre. In the 1850s the American bison or buffalo was subjected to extreme over-huntings, caused in part by the fur trade and high world demand, but also spurred by the advance of American railroads into the western frontier. There was an increase in the number of men who hunted the animals for sport and killed as many as they could shoot. Pierre Chouteau sold the fort that bore his name to the United States government in 1854. The government found the facilities inadequate and abandoned them in 1857 in favor of Fort Randall to the south. Salvageable buildings and materials were transported to Fort Randall, and any surviving timbers were used to fuel steamboats on the river. The trade in buffalo furs effectively ended by the early 1860s, when the United States Army established a presence in the region. After closure Fort Pierre Chouteau became part of reservation lands assigned to the Sioux in the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868. When the Dakota Territory was partitioned in 1889 and the Sioux reservation was reduced in size, the fort's land became available for homesteading. It was used as pasture land until 1930, when it was acquired by the state of South Dakota. The state property was further enlarged by a land gift in 1970. Archaeological activity in the 1980s identified a number of elements of the fort's structure, confirming its location. The site is now an open meadow just north of the city limits of Fort Pierre, on the north side of Fort Chouteau Road. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 and became a National Historic Landmark in 1991. A stone marker is located near the center of the site, accessible by a gravel path. There are no visible remains of the fort's buildings and infrastructure. The state is developing plans for improved access and interpretation at the site.

Description The exact location/address of this historic site is restricted. It is located on a high terrace overlooking the Missouri River. It consists of fifteen depressions consistent with traditional Native American earthlodge construction, with no evidence that the village was fortified (e.g. by being surrounded by a palisade). Pottery finds at the site were instrumental in establishing a prehistoric settlement chronology in the Big Bend area of central South Dakota between 1100 and 1300 CE. The site underwent excavation in 1962 under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution's River Basin Survey, a program that investigated river banks archaeologically in advance of planned flood control and water supply projects. The expedition excavated four of the house sites, which were depressions between in width. The ends appeared to be open, lacking posts, and were stained with red ocher. They also dug trenches in an unsuccessful bid to locate evidence of fortification. This differentiated the site from the nearby Jiggs Thompson Site, which the same crew found to be surrounded by a moat. Finds at this site included copper, shell, bone, and stone tools and ornaments.

This condition caused the infection he was fighting to spread, which resulted in massive organ failure. His parents had him baptized in the hospital and soon after he died surrounded by his parents.

He was marzpan of Armenia c. 628, fled to the Byzantine Empire soon thereafter and was exiled for several years to Africa for his participation in a plot against Heraclius. On his return c. 645/6, he was named curopalates and presiding prince of Armenia, but died before being formally invested.  Life  Varaztirots was the eldest son of Smbat IV Bagratuni. Along with his brother Garikhpet, he grew up in the Sassanid Persian court of Khosrau II (r. 591‚Äì628). Following the defeat of the rebellion of Vistahm, in which his father was instrumental, Varaztirots was named a royal cupbearer. At that point, or after Smbat's victory over the Hephthalites in 608, he also received the honorific name Javitean Khosrow (\\"Eternal Khosrau\\").Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 1363‚Äì1364Pourshariati (2008), pp. 153‚Äì154 In 628, Khosrau II was overthrown after a conspiracy in which several aristocratic houses, including Varaztirots, took part. As a reward, the new Persian shah, Kavadh II, appointed Varaztirots as marzpan of Armenia, with the rank of aspet.Pourshariati (2008), pp. 153‚Äì154, 173‚Äì174 He soon quarrelled with the Persian governor of neighbouring Azerbaijan, however, and fled with his family to the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, who, following the end of the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628, resided with his court in northern Mesopotamia. According to the Armenian chronicler Sebeos, Heraclius welcomed him with great honours, gave him valuable gifts and \\"exalted him above all the patricians of his kingdom\\". In 635 or 637, however, Varaztirots became involved in a conspiracy by several Armenian magnates to overthrow and murder Heraclius and replace him with his son, John Athalarichos. The conspiracy was uncovered, and Varaztirots was exiled to Africa; the treatment he received was more merciful than that of his co-conspirators as he had opposed the murder of the emperor. On his death-bed in 641, Heraclius pardoned Varaztrots and made his successor, Constantine III, swear that he would recall him and his family from exile and restore their honours. In the event, Varaztirots was recalled only in 645/6, by Constans II at the urging of Theodore Rshtuni. Varaztirots quickly fled from Constantinople to Armenia, but after assurances of loyalty, Constans then appointed him governor of Armenia with the high rank of curopalates. Before he could be formally invested, however, he fell ill and died. He was buried next to his father at Dariwnk, in Kogovit.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. At that time it was the only reliably dated site of the Lower James River Phase (Initial Variant). The site, sheltered under a dome, is managed by a nonprofit organization and is open to the public as Mitchell Prehistoric Indian Village. Visitors can watch archaeologists uncover artifacts in the Thomsen Center Archeodome. The Boehnen Memorial Museum features a reconstructed lodge and many of the artifacts found at the site. Description The Mitchell Site is located north of downtown Mitchell, on the east side of Indian Village Road, on a point overlooking Lake Mitchell. The site contains what was once a village made of lodges surrounded by a ditch and timber palisade. The people who once lived on the Mitchell site acquired their food from many different sources. The discovery of food processing tools and carbonized seeds suggest that these people were growing much of their food. Artifacts, such as hoes and squash knives are also good indicators that they were farmers. Various types of carbonized seeds and corn cobs show they were growing corn, beans, squash, sunflowers and tobacco.http://lithiccastinglab.com/gallery- pages/2011februarymitchellsitepage1.htm Archaeological history The site was first recorded archaeologically in 1922, when it was described as including 45 earth lodge sites, extending northward on a spur of land overlooking Firesteel Creek. The creek has since been dammed to form Lake Mitchell, and the area south of the surviving site elements has been landscaped as part of a golf course. The latter work in particular has compromised the ditches that originally surrounded the settlement. Two house depressions were excavated in 1938 by a crew funded by the Works Progress Administration. A house excavated in 1971 showed evidence of having been destroyed by fire, but included remarkable detail on its architecture. In 1975 a nonprofit organization was founded to continue archaeological work and to preserve the site.

Hurricane Katrina had damaged the previous facility in 2005. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was to pay for the costs of demolition of the previous library and construction of the new library since the previous facility had been, according to FEMA's estimation, over 50% damaged by Katrina. The features and amenities present in the new facility that were not in the previous facility were financed by other sources, including New Orleans municipal bond sales and funds from the Louisiana Recovery Authority. The \\"design-build\\" process, one specially allowed only in parishes affected by Hurricane Katrina under Louisiana law, was used to rebuild this library and four others. Two architectural firms, the New Orleans company Lee Ledbetter & Associates and the Kansas City, Missouri company Gould Evans Associates, were hired to design this library and four others. They were designed to have better access to public transportation and have reduced utility usage, including having electricity and water-saving features, in order to be more cost effective.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. The site contains the remains of a small fortified Native America village, consisting of earth lodges surrounded by a bastioned palisade, with further lodges scattered in the area outside the fortification. Evidence gathered at the site indicates it was occupied for a relatively brief period in the mid-1500s CE, and was assigned to the Chouteau aspect of Middle Missouri taxonomy, later known as the Extended Coalescent phase. Four lodge sites were excavated in the early 1960s, uncovering post holes and cache pits, one of which contained skull-less human remains. Finds at the site included pottery fragments and stone tools. Bone tools were also found, including plows made from bison shoulder blades. Molstad Village was named after Irene and Oscar Molstad, on whose ranch the village was found. The land belonged to Irene Molstad, a member of the federally recognized Cheyenne River Sioux Nation. She and her husband Oscar operated a cattle ranch, and allowed Smithsonian Institution researches to camp on their land while investing archaeological sites in the area in advance of the creation of Lake Oahe. The Molstad village site was excavated by this team in 1962 under the direction of J. Jake Hoffman. Finds at the site were important in enabling Hoffman to use pottery styles to establish a chronology of regional sites.

Children's magic is a specialized aspect of parlor magic and is meant to entertain children. It is typically performed at birthday parties, churches, preschools, elementary schools, Sunday Schools or libraries. It is often the only type of magic most Westerners experience other than that seen on television. This type of magic is usually comedic in nature.Fiscus, David. Birthday Magician's Handbook. Lee Jacobs Productions. 1980. A distinction should be made between Children's magic and \\"young magicians.\\" The former is meant for audiences made up of mostly children while the latter refers to performers who are under-aged. The later has organizations dedicated to them including Society of Young Magicians, Magic Youth International and Young Magicians' Club. Not every magician is interested in performing for children both artistically and in terms of patience. When Br. John Hamman, sm, was honored in 1995 during the first St. Louis Magical Heritage Awards, he explained in his acceptance speech the key to a successful magic performance: Since children do not have the social filters adults have in such situations, they have no compunction against pointing out every error or inconsistency a magician makes during his performance. This makes performing for children exceedingly difficult. Children's magicians often use certain gambits while performing for children. Some performers use their knowledge to intentionally misdirect the children in a given audience. One form of this type of misdirection is referred to as \\"Magician-in-Trouble\\" wherein a performer pretends to have made a mistake. The style used for children's magic is often comical and frequently uses props that are large and colorful. It is not uncommon for magicians to dress as clowns or in wild and outlandish costumes while performing.Ginn, David. Clown Magic. Piccadilly Books. 1993. Generally, children's magicians are reluctant to use tricks that focus on the use of playing cards, however magic with coins (see Coin magic) or paper money are frequently popular with children. Movement and action are preferable to patter. Buffoonery is a better vehicle than \\"mystery\\" for children.[1] These performers commonly use as many audience members as impromptu assistants as possible.[1] Common Children's Magic Props include: Run Rabbit Run, Hip Hop Rabbits, Change Bag Routines, Breakaway Wand, Tipsy Turvy Bottles, and Spongeballs. Older children (from 7 upwards) tend to have a far greater logic and less traditional and more innovative magic effects can be performed.

Plot In the introductory chapter, \\"Three Lost Travelers\\", the kits Mosskit, Adderkit and Blossomkit have somehow walked from StarClan to Rock's home under the earth. Rock tells the three that they did not live long enough to learn about their Clanmates. He says he will answer their questions \\"about the cats you left behind.\\" Rock describes himself as \\"the keeper of the world beneath the one your former Clanmates walk.\\" The remainder of the book consists of Rock's stories about each Clan, and various cats (or a group of cats) within the Clan. Rock describes major events in the cat's life, and often comments on why the cat is special or acted as he/she did. There are also stories about a few cats from the Tribe of Rushing Water, SkyClan, and BloodClan in addition to some loners and kittypets. Although Rock, as the narrator, claims neutrality, the book does not treat each Clan equally, devoting more space to ThunderClan cats and being highly critical of one of the other Clans.

The Clans and the cats described in the book are as follows: :ThunderClan: Firestar; Bluestar; Graystripe and Millie; Sandstorm; Yellowfang; Cinderpelt; Leafpool; Squirrelflight; Brambleclaw; Ashfur; Brightheart and Cloudtail (with an illustration of only Brightheart); Jaypaw, Hollypaw and Lionpaw. :ShadowClan: Tigerstar; Brokenstar; Blackstar; Tawnypelt; Boulder; Littlecloud and Runningnose. :WindClan: Tallstar; Onestar; Mudclaw; Crowfeather; Nightcloud and Breezepaw; Heatherpaw. :RiverClan: Crookedstar; Leopardstar; Graypool, Mistyfoot and Stonefur; Silverstream; Feathertail; Stormfur; Hawkfrost; Mothwing and Willowpaw. :Cats Outside the Clans: Ravenpaw and Barley; Princess and Smudge; Brook Where Small Fish Swim and Talon of Swooping Eagle (with an illustration of only Talon); Teller of the Pointed Stones; Cloudstar and Skywatcher; Leafstar, Echosong and Sharpclaw; Scourge and Bone. The book also contains four maps (Forest illustration, Forest diagram, Lake illustration, Lake diagram) and an excerpt from Eclipse, implying that this takes place between Outcast and Eclipse.  Errors  There are a few mistakes in the field guide, as in the mountains, it states that Firestar was there, but in the book Eclipse, Firestar is not there. In addition, the page about Mistyfoot stated that she fled to ThunderClan to ask for help when her brother was killed. In actuality, Firestar and Graystripe rescued her from what was essentially a prison along with Featherpaw and Stormpaw after Graystripe became concerned of his kits' well-being. Firestar and Graystripe witnessed Stonefur's death after he refused to kill the half-clan apprentices as proof of his loyalty, making it clear that the three half-clan cats were no longer welcomed. The only accurate information about that episode in the excerpt is that Mistyfoot took shelter in ThunderClan with Featherpaw and Stormpaw and remained there until the end of the original series. Also, Scourge and Bone are shown with orange collars, instead of purple for Scourge, and red for Bone. Critical reception A review by School Library Journal praised how the pictures show ferocity of the cats and how \\"the full-color portraits of these cats are spectacular. They show these characters to be exciting, vibrant, and unique, and will interest new readers much more than the tone-heavy, mysterious musings of the narrator\\".

Declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964, the mound complex extends for a distance of about along the Missouri River, and is one of the largest known complex of burial mounds in the Plains region north of Kansas. Description The Fort Thompson Mounds are a series of low earthen mounds, extending from the eastern (downstream) end of the Missouri River's Big Bend, downriver along the eastern bank, past Fort Thompson and the Big Bend Dam. They are generally located on a terrace above the river's bottomlands, roughly above the river's typical level in the early 1960s. All of these are believed to be burial mounds, which in some cases overlay older cultural materials. The sites were known but not studied prior to the 1950s, when the United States Army Corps of Engineers began planning the construction of Big Bend Dam as part of a flood control project. Beginning in 1957, archaeologists engaged in a series of digs to understand the sites better, and to perform salvage archaeology on sites that were likely to be inundated by the waters the dam would impound. In addition to burials found in the mounds, features of habitation were also discovered. These include stone hearths, pottery fragments, and stone tools. One of the sites excavated gave radiocarbon dates of c. 2450 BCE.

It is located at 1210 Locust Street in St. Louis, Missouri. The Dean of the Cathedral is the Very Reverend Kathie Adams-Shepherd. Adams-Shepherd is also the first female dean of this cathedral. Built during 1859‚Äì67, it is one of the few well-preserved surviving works of Leopold Eidlitz, a leading mid-19th-century American architect, and was designated a national historic landmark in 1994 for its architecture. History and description The cathedral is located in what is now downtown St. Louis, at the southeast corner of Thirteenth and Locust Streets. The main body of the church was built of Illinois sandstone, and its roof is of purple and green slate. It is basically a cruciform structure, with a tower projecting from the northern facade at the northwest corner. The base of the tower houses a baptistry, with a font of Italian marble. A smaller sandstone chapel dates to 1893‚Äì95. From 1910‚Äì1912, a tower and porch were added of Indiana limestone. The cathedral was built between 1859 and 1867, and designed by architect Leopold Eidlitz. The Gothic Revival structure was an expression of the city's sense of its significance as the United States expanded westwards. It was one of the earliest churches influenced by the revival within the Episcopal Church of early Christian practices and styles, which later was influenced by the Oxford Movement originating in England. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1994. Montana silver magnate Charles D. McLure, a St. Louis native, was revealed to be the anonymous donor of $50,000 toward constructing the cathedral (approximately $6.5 million today).An Ambassador of Christ: William Schuyler See also *List of the Episcopal cathedrals of the United States *List of cathedrals in the United States *List of National Historic Landmarks in Missouri *National Register of Historic Places listings in Downtown and Downtown West St. Louis ReferencesExternal links Christ Church Cathedral website Category:National Historic Landmarks in Missouri Category:Churches in St. Louis Category:Episcopal cathedrals in Missouri Category:Episcopal church buildings in Missouri Category:Churches completed in 1867 Category:19th-century Episcopal church buildings Category:Landmarks of St. Louis Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Missouri Category:National Register of Historic Places in St. Louis Category:Downtown West, St. Louis Category:1867 establishments in Missouri Category:Tourist attractions in St. Louis Category:Buildings and structures in St. Louis ","title":"Christ Church Cathedral (St. Louis, Missouri)"},{"id":"18083262","text":"Scott-Bathgate building, 149 Pioneer Ave, Winnipeg, Manitoba Scott-Bathgate Limited is a foodstuff manufacturer that is known for its Nutty Club brand of candy and nut products.

It was available in two types; \\"Neutral\\", and one that claimed to have a \\"Color Enhancement Formula\\" that contained a black hair dye. As a product designed for home use, it was promoted through infomercials in the early to mid-1990s. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and state government offices began receiving complaints about the Rio hair products in mid-1994. Many complainants said they had bought the hair relaxers by mail after viewing a 30-minute TV infomercial targeted to African Americans. Some complainants reported that their hair began falling out immediately after applying the products, while others said they had problems after multiple applications. Some said they had seen doctors for treatment of scalp irritation. Many women said they had to cut their hair short to deal with bald spots. Timeline November 6 and 8, 1994 FDA collected samples of the hair relaxers, at a Los Angeles-based affiliate, Pantron I Corp., of World Rio. Most of the products, which were imported from Brazil, were in the possession of Product Packaging West, also known as Pic 'N' Pac West, of North Hollywood, California. November 23, 1994 the California Department of Health embargoed the products held in Los Angeles and North Hollywood, essentially blocking their sale in the United States. December 21, 1994 FDA advised against use of the products after laboratory findings identified the low pH and the number of consumer complaints indicated that the hair relaxers were causing adverse reactions. About the same time, World Rio stated it would stop all sales of the products, but the FDA received reports from consumers that the company may still have been taking orders and billing customers through a mail-order company: Addressing and Mailing Inc., in North Las Vegas, Nevada. January 23, 1995, at FDA's request, U.S. marshals seized the entire lot of products at Product Packaging West in California. January 24, 1995 an investigator with FDA's San Francisco district office went to Addressing and Mailing to inspect the firm and found more than 8,000 cases of the Rio hair relaxers, worth about $500,000 in retail value. FDA notified the State of Nevada Division of Health, which, in turn, embargoed the products, thus preventing their sale. June 14, 1995 World Rio voluntarily destroyed the 8,000 cases of Rio hair relaxers held at Addressing and Mailing in Nevada. Safety concerns Despite the claims of the relaxer being safe and natural, the product contained copper, ammonium, and chloride salts and a pH of less than the listed level of 3. Due to these factors, people using the product suffered from hair loss, scalp burns, and (in some cases) green hair color. By 1995, there were over 3,000 complaints lodged with the Food and Drug Administration. Eventually, the product was barred from being imported into the U.S., and all remaining company stocks were destroyed.Kurtzweil, Paula (March 1996). \\"Hair relaxers destroyed after consumers complain ‚Äì products sold by World Rio Corp\\", FDA Consumer.

Henry Frawley developed what became the largest and most successful cattle ranch in western South Dakota by purchasing lands that had failed as smaller homesteading parcels. The property was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1977. History Patrick Henry Frawley was born March 13, 1851, in Washington County, New York to Thomas and Honora (Hogan) Frawley who had immigrated from County Limerick, Ireland. Frawley was graduated from the University of Wisconsin law school in 1876. In 1877 the Indian lands of the Black Hills District was opened to settlers and Frawley traveled by train to Bismarck, North Dakota and then by wagon train to Deadwood, Dakota Territory, where he set up a law practice. He was successful from the start and in 1879 joined with a partner, Edward L. Kohen, as Frawley and Kohen law firm. In 1894 John P. Laffey and a James Frawley joined to form Frawley and Laffey. In 1896 James moved to Nome, Alaska and in 1903 E.L. Frawley joined to form Frawley and Frawley.

There are two similar, common forms. As with the five-number summary, it can be represented by a modified box plot, adding hatch-marks on the \\"whiskers\\" for two of the additional numbers. Seven-number summary The following percentiles are (approximately) evenly spaced under a normally distributed variable: # the 2nd percentile # the 9th percentile # the 25th percentile or lower quartile or first quartile # the 50th percentile or median (middle value, or second quartile) # the 75th percentile or upper quartile or third quartile # the 91st percentile # the 98th percentile The middle three values - the lower quartile, median, and upper quartile - are the usual statistics from the five-number summary and are the standard values for the box in a box plot. The two unusual percentiles at either end are used because the locations of all seven values will be approximately equally spaced if the data is normally distributed (four equally spaced percentiles with three digits of precision are 2.15, 8.87, 25.0, and 50.0). Some statistical tests require normally distributed data, so the plotted values provide a convenient visual check for validity of later tests, simply by scanning to see if the marks for those seven percentiles appear to be equal distances apart on the graph. Notice that whereas the extreme values of the five-number summary depend on the number of samples, the seven-number summary does not. The values can be represented using a modified box plot. The 2nd and 98th percentiles are represented by the ends of the whiskers, and hatch-marks across the whiskers mark the 9th and 91st percentiles. Bowley‚Äôs seven-figure summary Arthur Bowley used a set of non-parametric statistics, called a \\"seven-figure summary\\", including the extremes, deciles, and quartiles, along with the median. Thus the numbers are: # the sample minimum # the 10th percentile (first decile) # the 25th percentile or lower quartile or first quartile # the 50th percentile or median (middle value, or second quartile) # the 75th percentile or upper quartile or third quartile # the 90th percentile (last decile) # the sample maximum Note that the middle five of the seven numbers are very nearly the same as for the seven number summary, above. The addition of the deciles allow one to compute the interdecile range, which for a normal distribution can be scaled to give a reasonably efficient estimate of standard deviation, and the 10% midsummary, which when compared to the median gives an idea of the skewness in the tails.

This property is included in, and forms part of the northern boundary of, the Arrow Rock State Historic Site. The house is a small single-story brick structure, with a three-bay front facade, side gable roof, and chimneys built into the end walls. Its main block has two rooms, and there is a wood frame addition to the rear. The house was built in 1837 by George Caleb Bingham, then just married and starting his career. He lived intermittently in this house until 1845, and it is where he developed his signature style of portrait and landscape painting that featured the landscapes and people of the Missouri frontier. The house underwent a number of significant changes after Bingham moved out. By 1870 it had reportedly been enlarged, and a second story added. In 1926 it was purchased by a preservationist, and it was acquired by the state in 1934. It was then subjected to a restoration that removed all additions and reduced it to its brick core. It was given a more thoughtful restoration in 1964‚Äì65, whose goal was to return it to a Federal style appearance, given that there was little documentary evidence of its condition during Bingham's residency.

In June 1899, President William McKinley laid a cornerstone for the \\"new mills\\" of Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing, but was forced to cut his visit short by his wife's illness. By 1917 the company was capitalized at $2,500,000 and contained over 260,000 ring and mule spindles and 6,500 looms for the production of cotton textiles,Official American Textile Directory, 1917, Bragdon, Lord & Nagle Co., New York, publishers making it one of the largest cotton textile companies in the world. In 1929, Berkshire merged with the Valley Falls Company of Rhode Island, and became known as Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates. Its head was Malcolm Greene Chace of the influential Chace family of New England. Malcolm's descendants (his son Malcolm Jr, and grandson Malcolm III) would run the company until 2007. In 1930 the company acquired the King Philip Mills in Fall River, Massachusetts. In 1931 the company acquired the Parker Mills of Fall River and Warren, Rhode Island. Unlike many New England textile companies that failed during the 1920s and 1930s, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates would survive the Great Depression intact. At its peak in 1948, Berkshire earned $29.5 million and employed 11,000 workers at 11 mills, under the leadership of Malcolm Greene Chace Jr. In 1955, Malcolm Jr. put together the merger of Berkshire with Hathaway Manufacturing Co., founded in New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1888 by Horatio Hathaway, to form Berkshire Hathaway Inc. By 1958 the complex was closed by Berkshire Hathaway, with Mill #4 having been the last cotton mill in the state's westernmost county.https://www.massmoments.org/moment- details/berkshire-hathaway-announces-mill-closing.html By the early 1960s, the mills had been sold separately. Declining demand for industrial spaces led to the demolition of Mills #2 and 3, leaving Mill #1 as it originally stood.https://catalog.archives.gov/id/63794368 Also in the 1960s, outside Adams the Berkshire mill empire had declined to seven plants and 6,000 people, but still annually produced one quarter of a billion yards of material that sold for more than $60 million. The assets, and a sizable amount of cash on the balance sheet, caught the eye of Warren Buffett, an up-and-coming but then little-known investor from Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett, who had founded Buffett Partnership Limited to make investments, started buying stock in Berkshire at $7.60 a share. He eventually paid an average of $14.86 a share, or a total of $14 million, and took control of the company on May 10, 1965. By then, the company had declined to two mills and 2,300 employees. Buffett used Berkshire Hathaway as his investment vehicle, took the chairman's job in 1970 and acquired dozens of companies.Providence Journal Article, July 10, 2006 Berkshire Mill No. 1 was converted into 65 apartments in 1987 and is currently managed by Harvest Properties LLC.

These early groups have left a lasting impression on the hip-hop industry in the Gambia today, and some groups such as Da Fugitivz are still active in the industry. The first award ceremony to promote and celebrate Gambian hip-hop artists was the Rap Award '99 ceremony held at Kairaba Beach Hotel on July 31, 1999. The awards ceremony was organized by Gambian music promoter Harona Drammeh, who was a staff member of GRTS at the time. Now there are various award ceremonies held to promote Gambian artists in the music industry. In 2007, Black Lynx and One Tribe Sound, the best known hip hop movements and promoters in the country, joined forces as the Afric Alliance, and came up with the open mic show where rappers were invited to perform. = International success = Many of these early Gambian artists had breakthroughs in the international scene during the 1990s, and the success of Gambian hip-hop internationally is attributable to the global appeal of hip- hop. In August 1999 after releasing their first album, Gambian rap group Da Fugitivz were invited to the Pop Com Musical Festival in Germany, and were subsequently featured on an \\"Africa Raps\\" compilation for the German record label Trikon in 1999. The group toured internationally, playing in Europe and the United States, and received national and international awards. International artists of Gambian-origin such as Atlanta-based rapper Salma Slims have achieved mainstream success in markets such as the United States. = Popularity and evolution = Gambia's hip-hop industry continued to grow throughout the 21st Century, popularized by new rappers such as Freaky Joe (now better known as Singhateh), and Sing-Jay Rebellion. In the early 1990s, the Gambian hip hop scene was dominated by male rappers based in the Gambia, although now both female rappers and Gambian rappers settled abroad are getting into the scene. Nancy Nanz a.k.a. Gambian Beyonce, is one of a few women to make a breakthrough in the Gambian hip-hop industry and become well known in the Gambia. Other emerging female Gambian rap artists include Debbie Romero, a Nigerian who was raised in Gambia.Debbie Romeo Cultural impact and reception Reggae and hip-hop music are the most popular genres in the Gambia, and have broad appeal in the ghettos of Gambia. Hip hop fashion, including baggy pants, sneakers, and baseball caps, has become very popular among male youths in Gambia although the popularity of hip hop is not as politicized as it is in many countries. The media, especially the Gambia Radio and Television Services, actively promotes artists in the hip-hop scene. Apart from the normal broadcasts, Saturday nights are usually dedicated to showcasing the music scene of the Gambia and a show called Extra Touch was the first of its kind on GRTS to invite rappers to perform live in their studios. = Politics in Gambian hip-hop = Many individual Gambian rappers use music to express controversial political and social ideas. The hip-hop community was repressed during the presidency of Yahya Jammeh, but had a resurgence after his exit from office when political topics were once again able to be explored in mainstream entertainment. Hip-hop artists and political activists Retsam and Ali Cham (known by the stagename Killa) Ace protested the presidency of Yahya Jammeh, during whose tenure they were forced to leave the country due to threats of arrest or violence. Cham fled the country and entered Senegal with his family and management after they were allegedly targeted with death threats by the Gambian government. Cham returned to Gambia, where he continued to protest police brutality and corruption, after President Adama Barrow took office in 2017. Cham was subsequently arrested and charged with assault after an alleged run-in with law enforcement. Cham's controversial trial prompted criticism of Gambia's law enforcement, and renewed concerns of police brutality and corruption.

The colours of the flag are meant to include the colours of the furs of animal bears throughout the world, not necessarily referring to human skin and hair colour tones: Dark brown, orange/rust, golden yellow, tan, white, gray, and black. The flag was designed with inclusion in mind. The gay bear culture celebrates secondary sex characteristics such as growth of body hair and facial hair, which is typically considered a \\"bear\\" trait. Background Craig Byrnes created the Bear pride flag in 1995. Byrnes' undergraduate degree in psychology involved designing a senior project about the bear culture that has exploded since the early 1980s, of which he had first-hand experience. He thought it might be fitting to design a flag that would best represent the bear community and include it with the results of his research. To do this, he received help from another influential member of the bear cultural community. Four variations were sewing machine-constructed and Byrnes won approval to display the four prototype flags at the Chesapeake Bay Bears \\"Bears of Summer\\" events in July 1995. The winning design is a field of simple horizontal stripes with a paw print in the upper left corner ‚Äî a layout familiar to anyone who has seen the Leather Pride flag.

Angelina Napolitano (1882-1932) was an immigrant to Canada who murdered her abusive husband in 1911, igniting a public debate about domestic violence and the death penalty.Platinum Image Film press release New Film About Italian Immigrant, March 13, 2006. Accessed June, 2008 via A Guide to Women in Canadian History She was the first woman in Canada to use the battered woman defense on a murder charge. Napolitano was found guilty, and although the jury recommended clemency, she was sentenced to death. After an international outcry, however, the Canadian federal cabinet eventually commuted her sentence to life imprisonment. She served 11 years before being paroled. In 2005, the story of Napolitano's marriage and dramatic trial was turned into an award-winning independent film, Looking for Angelina.Official film website: Looking for Angelina , accessed June, 2008Navarretta the mastermind behind Angelina by Ravi Amarnath. The Gazette, University of Western Ontario, September 26, 2006 accessed June, 2008 Early life and marriage Angelina was born in Italy about 1883, probably in a small town not too far from Naples. Her family name is not known. She married Pietro Napolitano about 1898 and the couple emigrated to America shortly after the turn of the century. They lived in New York City for seven years and moved to Canada in 1909‚Äîfirst to Thessalon, Ontario, then to Sault Ste. Marie, where there was a sizable Italian immigrant community.Statistics Canada: Selected Ethnic Origins, Sault Ste. Marie accessed June, 2008 The couple had four children. The Napolitano marriage was not good; Pietro beat and threatened his wife. In November 1910, he attacked her with a pocket knife, stabbing her nine times in the face, neck, shoulder, chest and arms and wounding her badly. He was charged with assault, but received a suspended sentence. Killing After her conviction, newspapers across North America gathered petition signatures calling for Napolitano's sentence to be commuted or for her to be released. As the winter of 1910-1911 continued, Pietro, who worked on and off as a labourer, began to pressure Angelina to earn money (to build the family a house) by prostitution. Retrieved June 2008. On April 16, 1911, Easter Sunday, when Angelina was six months pregnant, Pietro told her to go out and make money through sex or he would beat her, kill her, or kill her unborn child. He was going to sleep and she had until he woke to get some money. That afternoon, as Pietro slept in their top-floor apartment on James Street, Angelina took an axe and hit him four times in the neck and head, killing him. She immediately sought out a neighbour and confessed, adding \\"I just killed a pig\\", then waited for the police to come. They found her with her arms wrapped around her youngest child, and charged her with murder. Trial The trial began on Monday, May 8, 1911, in Sault Ste. Marie, with Justice Byron Moffatt Britton presiding and Edmund Meredith as the crown attorney. When the court realized that Napolitano did not have a lawyer, the trial was adjourned for a day to allow the court-appointed lawyer, Uriah McFadden, to prepare a case. When the trial resumed on Tuesday, May 9, Meredith called nine witnesses to testify to Napolitano's guilt. McFadden called only Angelina herself, who did not speak English well. McFadden's case rested on what was essentially the battered woman defense; he argued that Pietro's abuse had forced a desperate Angelina to murder, and cited the November stabbing. Britton, however, ruled the incident inadmissible evidence, arguing that \\"if anybody injured six months ago could give that as justification or excuse for slaying a person, it would be anarchy complete\\". The jury returned a guilty verdict. The trial had lasted only three hours. Although the jury recommended clemency, Britton sentenced her to hang. The execution was scheduled for August 9, one month after Napolitano's due date. Reaction and aftermath Napolitano's pregnancy at the time of sentencing was emphasized, helping to make her an international cause c√©l√®bre. Once the story hit the newspapers, however, a media frenzy began‚Äînot just in Sault Ste. Marie, but especially in the United States and even Europe. Though some of the coverage was negative, arguing from racist stereotypes that Napolitano, as an Italian, was a \\"hot-blooded foreigner\\" and deserved to pay the penalty for her crime, most of it revolved around those sympathetic to the abuse she had suffered, and agitating for her sentence to be commuted to jail time or even a pardon. The federal minister of justice, Sir Allen Bristol Aylesworth, received many letters from individuals (including McFadden), as well as petitions organized by groups in Sault Ste Marie, Toronto, New York City, Chicago, England, Austria, and Poland. A doctor in Ohio, Dr. Alexander Aalto, even offered to be hanged in Angelina's place, saying: \\"It would only be fair to Mrs. Napolitano for a man to give his life for her, inasmuch as her life is in peril on account of a man's persecution of her, and because men condemned her.\\" Dr. Aalto's remarks reflect a theme among Napolitano's supporters, who included women in the fledgling feminist movement. These early feminists argued that Pietro's beatings meant the murder was in self-defense, and that Britton was being sexist when he threw out the evidence of abuse. The British suffragette journal Common Cause excoriated not only the law that had condemned Angelina, but also the justice system that upheld it as \\"both bad, for they are exclusively masculine\\". Other arguments presented in the letters included the idea (put forward by the area's MP, Arthur Cyril Boyce) that Angelina must be not guilty because her pregnancy made her temporarily insane, and the argument that Napolitano's fear of her impending doom would adversely affect her unborn baby, therefore she should be pardoned. This last was a common psychological view at the time. Whether any of these arguments had an impact, the federal cabinet eventually did commute Angelina's sentence to life imprisonment on July 14, 1911. Napolitano's later life is not well known. She did give birth, but the baby died within a few weeks. Her older children were placed in foster homes. She was granted parole on December 30, 1922, after serving 11 years at Kingston Penitentiary. Napolitano reportedly died on September 4, 1932, at the Hotel Dieu Hospital in Frontenac County, Ontario. Film In 2003, independent film director Sergio Navarretta began researching Angelina's life for a documentary, but expanded the project into a feature film \\"once we realized how dramatic the facts were\\". The film, Looking for Angelina, was shot in two weeks in 2004 at Sault Ste. Marie, on a shoestring budget of $250,000. The writers, Alessandra Piccione and Frank Canino, took inspiration from Canino's play The Angelina Project. Lina Giornofelice starred as Angelina, with Alvaro D'Antonio playing Pietro. For authenticity, large parts of the film are in period-correct Italian with English subtitles. The film showed at the Montreal World Film Festival, Cin√©fest in Sudbury, Quitus Italian Film Festival in Montreal, Shadows of the Mind Festival in Sault Ste Marie, the International Film Festival of India, Cimameriche Film Festival in Genoa and the Mumbai International Film Festival. \\"In general\\", said director Navaretta, \\"audiences have responded to the film on an emotional level, empathizing with the journey of [the characters].\\" Looking For Angelina won three awards: A Special Recognition at the Cimameriche Film Festival and Best Feature (Drama) and Quitus Award of Distinction at the Quitus Film Festival in Montreal. Domestic violence campaign The film Looking For Angelina includes a domestic violence awareness campaign component. The film's producers, Platinum Image Film, often screened the movie before a panel discussion of domestic violence experts, or put on screenings to raise money for organizations such as the Shelter from the Storm Campaign. , the film DVD sells packaged with a 114-page companion book, Child Abuse Prevention and Intervention, written by Toronto community agency BOOST. The book is intended to help teachers help children learn about and prevent family violence.Second Story Press Fall 2008 catalogue, page 10. Book .

Gardner (October 31, 1921 ‚Äì October 23, 2007) was an American psychologist who published works on individual differences and cognition. Early life and education Gardner was born in Ree Heights, South Dakota, and was the son of Hugh Gardner and Ruth Speicher Gardner. They were among the \\"town people\\" in the tiny farming community of Ree Heights, South Dakota. His father was at various times a store keeper, an insurance agent, postmaster and the co-op grain elevator manager, as well as school board president and church elder. His mother was the piano teacher and church organist for the community. In Ree Heights Riley lived very close to his uncle (Hugh's brother) Charles Whiting Gardner, a banker and South Dakota state Senator married to Mary Ruth Butler Gardner, and his cousins Chuck (later a speech writer for a United States Senator) and Barbara (later Barbara Gardner Burns). Riley Gardner was the second born of three children, after his sister Katherine who was four years his elder, and before his brother Wayne. He graduated first in his high school class (which numbered ten students total) from Ree Heights High School in Ree Heights, South Dakota. In 1945 he graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor's in English from Yankton College in Yankton, South Dakota. After college, Gardner entered the military and became a staff sergeant in the US Army Medical Corps, serving from 1946 until 1948. It was during this military service that he was introduced to psychiatric care. Following the military, he earned his Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Kansas in 1952, summa cum laude, a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He married Ruth Janssen on August 27, 1950 in Yankton, South Dakota. Career Gardner spent most of his professional career (from 1951 to 1971) as a research psychologist at the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kansas. During this time he was the Director of the research group engaged in studying cognition control principles.Gardner, Riley W., & Moriarty, Alice. Personality Development at Preadolescence: Explorations of Structure Formation. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1968. He had two major grants from the National Institutes of Health and invitations to teach in seminars and at universities around the USA and abroad, and he published numerous papers on individual differences and cognition. Gardner's work was part of what was called the \\"new look in perception.\\" In the late 1950s an attempt was being made in academic psychology and psychoanalysis to correlate and study the interaction of cognition, needs, and personality. A number of the leaders of this \\"new look\\" were psychoanalytically trained psychologists working at the Menninger Clinic. Gardner was part of this well known group that also included George Klein, Philip Holzman, and Robert Holt. Gardner, with his research on cognitive controls, was part of this group that insisted that cognition played an essential role in the formation and functioning of personality rather than being a mental function separate from personality. This idea is an implicit foundation for modern day psychoanalytic concepts such as self and object representations, mentalization, and a structural perspective on the workings of the mind. The concept of cognitive control explains Gardner and Klein's finding that individuals use particular cognitive or ego strategies to notice, register, compare, process, integrate or avoid information from the environment. Furthermore, individuals differ in the types of strategies they use. The entire focus on self-regulation within the field of psychoanalysis is based on this assumption. As part of his research, he performed an in-depth study of 105 pairs of twins in the vicinity of Topeka, Kansas, and received an honorary invitation to membership in Topeka's Mothers of Twins Club. In late 1970 he suffered a temporary mental breakdown which marked the end of his professional career.\\"Obituaries: Dr. Riley W.

A catcher, Wine played parts of two seasons in Major League Baseball for the Houston Astros in 1986 and 1987. He last played professional baseball in 1990. He was the head baseball coach of the Penn State Nittany Lions from 2005‚Äì2013. In 2014, Wine managed the Eugene Emeralds, a minor league team in the San Diego Padres organization. Early years Robbie graduated from Methacton High School in Norristown, PA in 1980 where he was a stand-out catcher. Playing career Wine was an All- American catcher for the Oklahoma State Cowboys, where he played from 1981‚Äì1983. In 1982, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was drafted in the first round (8th overall) of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft by the Astros. After three seasons of minor league baseball, Wine made his major league debut on September 2, 1986 as a September call-up. He played nine games, getting 3 hits in 12 at bats. In 1987, Wine was called up again in July after both Mark Bailey and Ronn Reynolds had been tried as the backup catcher to Alan Ashby. Wine played in 13 games in July and August, but batted just .103. He appeared in one final major league game on October 3. The following spring, he was traded to the Texas Rangers for pitcher Mike Loynd, and from 1988-90 he played in five different organizations without returning to the majors. Coaching career After his playing career ended following the 1990 season, Wine served as an assistant coach in professional baseball from 1991‚Äì1996. Prior to the 1997 season, he accepted an assistant coaching position at his alma mater Oklahoma State. Prior to the 2005 season, he was hired as the head baseball coach at Penn State.

This term was coined in 1981, describing cocci in seawater that were less than 0.3 Œºm in diameter. Ultramicrobacteria have also been recovered from soil and appear to be a mixture of Gram-positive, Gram-negative and cell- wall-lacking species. Ultramicrobacteria possess a relatively high surface- area-to-volume ratio due to their small size, which aids in growth under oligotrophic (i.e. nutrient-poor) conditions. The relatively small size of ultramicrobacteria also enables parasitism of larger organisms; some ultramicrobacteria have been observed to be obligate or facultative parasites of various eukaryotes and prokaryotes. One factor allowing ultramicrobacteria to achieve their small size seems to be genome minimization such as in the case of the ultramicrobacterium P. ubique whose small 1.3 Mb genome is seemingly devoid of extraneous genetic elements like non-coding DNA, transposons, extrachromosomal elements etc. However, genomic data from ultramicrobacteria is lacking since the study of ultramicrobacteria, like many other prokaryotes, is hindered by difficulties in cultivating them. Microbacterial studies from Berkeley Labs at UC Berkeley have produced detailed microscopy images of ultra-small microbial species. Cells imaged have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns, meaning that about 150,000 of them could fit on the tip of a human hair. These bacteria were found in groundwater samples from Rifle, Colorado, after the water was filtered through filters commonly believed to sterilize water. These samples were then brought to Berekeley's Lab's Life Sciences Division, and analyzed with 2-D and 3-D cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. Images of theses ultra-small bacteria display dense spirals of DNA, few ribosomes, hair-like fibrous appendages, and minimized metabolic systems. Such cells probably gain most essential nutrients and metabolites from other bacteria. Genomic sequencing of specimens found the genomes to be about 1 million base pairs long, and that the species found came from multiple phyla. Bacteria in the ultra-small size range are thought to be rather common but difficult to detect. Ultramicrobacteria are commonly confused with ultramicrocells, the latter of which are the dormant, stress-resistant forms of larger cells that form under starvation conditions (ie. these larger cells downregulate their metabolism, stop growing and stabilize their DNA to create ultramicrocells that remain viable for years) whereas the small size of ultramicrobacteria is not a starvation response and is consistent even under nutrient-rich conditions. The term \\"nanobacteria\\" is sometimes used synonymously with ultramicrobacteria in the scientific literature, but ultramicrobacteria are distinct from the purported nanobacteria or \\"calcifying nanoparticles\\", which were proposed to be living organisms that were 0.1 Œºm in diameter. These structures are now thought to be non-living, and likely precipitated particles of inorganic material.

Aspinwall was descended from, and related to, many prominent American families including the Roosevelts, Howlands, and Aspinwalls, that were heavily involved in the merchant trade business and politics, wielding vast power and ensuring wealth for generations. Early life William Henry Aspinwall was born on December 16, 1807 in Manhattan, New York. He was the third of seven children born to John Aspinwall (1774‚Äì1847) and Susan Howland (1779‚Äì1852). His father, who traveled extensively, was associated with the dry goods merchant firm of Gilbert & Aspinwall. His younger sister, Mary Rebecca Aspinwall (1809‚Äì1886) was married to Isaac Roosevelt, the grandfather of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His maternal aunt, Harriet Howland, was the third wife of Isaac's father, New York State Assemblyman James Roosevelt. His maternal grandparents were Joseph and Lydia Howland. The Howland family was descended from John Howland, a signer of the Mayflower Compact. His cousin, Emily Aspinwall Howland, daughter of Samuel Shaw Howland, was married to Henry Chauncey, the son of Henry Chauncey, Esq., of Alsop & Chauncey in Valpara√≠so, and Lucy Wetmore Alsop, the grandniece of Continental Congressman John Alsop. Scott, Erving M. and Others, Evolution of Shipping and Ship-Building in California, Part I, Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine, Volume 25, January 1895, pp.5-16; from quod.lib.umich.edu accessed March 10, 2015 His paternal grandfather, Captain John Aspinwall, was one of the most prominent shipmasters of the New York merchant marine before the American Revolutionary War. He was a member of the Aspinwall family who were well known in New York society and were descended from William Aspinwall, who was among the first settlers of New England. Another relation, Sir Algernon Apsinwall, served as vice president and secretary of the West India Committee for forty years. Career The Sea WitchView of Aspinwall, Panama, 1855 After obtaining a \\"substantial education\\" at local private schools, Aspinwall began working as a clerk for G.G. & S.S. Howland, a merchant firm founded brothers Gardiner Greene Howland and Samuel Shaw Howland, who were younger siblings of Aspinwall's mother Susan, a position he held until 1832. The firm imported high-status goods such as porcelain, silk, and tea from China, and sold them to Americans of means. =Howland & Aspinwall= In 1832, he became a partner in Howland & Aspinwall, along with his cousin William Edgar Howland, the son of founder Gardiner Howland. After assuming the presidency in 1835, he expanded trade to South America, China, Europe, the Mediterranean, and the East and West Indies. Howland & Aspinwall owned some of the most famous clipper ships ever built. In 1845, while the firm owned the Ann McKim which was regarded as the fastest ship afloat, it built the Rainbow, which was even faster. The Rainbow was the high-tech racehorse of its day, and is considered to be the first of the extreme clippers. Instead of the bluff bow that was customary on ships up until that time, the Rainbow had a sharp bow, prompting on-lookers to joke that maybe she would sail better backwards. The next year, Howland & Aspinwall had the Sea Witch built, which set a speed record from China to New York which still stands.Somerville, Col. Duncan S., The Aspinwall Empire, p. 22, Mystic Seaport Museum, Inc., Mystic, CT, 1983. Panama Railroad schedule Clipper ships sacrificed cargo capacity for speed, but in some markets, the fast service allowed their owners to charge premium rates (Tea from China tasted better if it was fresh, so the cargo on the first ship of the season to arrive in New York was worth more). Also faster speed meant that the vessel could complete more voyages in a given time period, which also helped make up for the diminished cargo capacity. The firm and its profits made Aspinwall very wealthy, reportedly one of the richest men on the East Coast in the nineteenth century. =Pacific Mail Steamship Company= In 1840s, William's younger brother John Lloyd Aspinwall succeeded him as president of Howland & Aspinwall so he could devote his time to transportation around the Isthmus of Panama. In 1848, Aspinwall, along with Gardiner G. Howland and Henry Chauncey, founded the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, to provide service to California. This turned out to be a rather good year in which to start a steamship line to California, since the Gold Rush started the next year. Howland & Aspinwall were also the recipients of a federal government subsidy to operate their trans-oceanic steamship line, against which they were forced to compete with the unsubsidized line owned by Cornelius Vanderbilt. The company's first vessel to make the trip was packed with passengers. Pacific Mail eventually became American President Lines,Niven, John, The American President Lines and its Forebears 1948-1984, p. 15, University of Delaware Press, Newark, NJ, 1987. which is now part of Neptune Orient Lines.Elias, Rahita, Beyond Boundaries: The First 35 Years of the NOL Story, p. 8, Neptune Orient Lines Ltd., 2004. =Panama Canal Railway= Following the Steamship Company, Aspinwall then promoted a railway in Panama. The project, which began in May 1850 and was later known as the Panama Canal Railway, was the first transcontinental railroad in the Americas and was built to provide a shorter and more secure path between the United States' East and West Coasts. When completed in 1855, the line was designated as an \\"inter-oceanic\\"\\"A Great Enterprise\\" The Portland (Maine) Transcript [Newspaper], February 17, 1855. railroad crossing as it connected ports on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The tropical rain forest terrain and outbreak of malaria and cholera, rendered its five year construction, at a cost of $8,000,000, a considerable engineering challenge, and required more than seven thousand workers drawn from \\"every quarter of the globe.\\"Otis, F.N.,\\"Illustrated History of the Panama Railroad\\" (Harper & Bros., New York, 1861), p. 12, 35 =Later life and Civil War involvement= Aspinwall retired in 1856, but remained active as a philanthropist and spent considerable time improving his country estate near Tarrytown, New York, which was later sold by his son to William Rockefeller, brother of John D. Rockefeller, for $150,000 in 1886 and became part of Pocantico Hills, New York. He was elected as a fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers on July 9, 1870. Although he never held office, Aspinwall, an admirer of George B. McClellan, was a participant at the \\"ill-fated\\" Peace Conference of 1861 in Washington. Later, after the outbreak of the American Civil War, Aspinwall and John Murray Forbes were sent by the Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, on a secret mission to England to obtain their \\"interference in the building and outfitting of iron-clads then in course of construction by Messrs. Laird\\" intended for the Confederate States Navy. They were sent with millions of dollars in U.S. Bonds from the U.S. Treasury. While Forbes and Aspinwall did not persuade the British to buy the ships, their interference forced the British to detain the ships and conduct a lengthy investigation, essentially cutting off the supply of ships to the Confederate Navy. In 1866, he was a founder of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in 1869. He owned works by Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo, Antonio da Correggio, Diego Vel√°zquez, Bartholomeus van der Helst, Teniers, Peter Paul Rubens, Philips Wouwerman, Cuyp, Ary Scheffer, Gerard, Dow, Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem, Titian, Adriaen Brouwer, Gerard ter Borch, Paul Veronese, Mieris, and Leonardo Da Vinci, Romney, Jean-Baptiste Greuze, and Jean-Baptiste Madou. Personal life In 1830, Aspinwall was married to Anna Lloyd Breck (1812‚Äì1885). She was the daughter of Catherine Douce (n√©e Israel) Breck (1789‚Äì1864) and George Breck (1784‚Äì1869), the brother of U.S. Representatives Samuel Breck and Daniel Breck. Anna was the sister of Rev. James Lloyd Breck, an Episcopal missionary, and Jane Breck, who married Aspinwall's brother John. Together, William and Anna were the parents of: * Anna Lloyd Aspinwall (1831‚Äì1880), who in 1850 married architect James Renwick Jr. (1818‚Äì1895), the son of Margaret Brevoort and James Renwick, an engineer, architect, and professor at Columbia College. * Lloyd Aspinwall (1834‚Äì1886), who married Harriette Prescott D'Wolf (d. 1888), granddaughter of James DeWolf. * Rev.

As a National Historic Landmark, it was designated to recognize the achievements of Joseph Erlanger (1874-1965), an American doctor and physiologist, who was awarded with the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1944. It was Erlanger's home from 1917 until his death. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and However, the house is not open to the public. Description and history The Erlanger House is located in the St. Louis' Forest Park area, on the north side of Waterman Boulevard, between Lake Avenue and Kingshighway Boulevard. It is an architecturally undistinguished suburban two story brick building, with a dormered hip roof. The front facade is made up of two bays wide, with a single-story porch extending across its width. A polygonal window bay projects above the main entrance and a two-story bay projects from the right side. The front roof face has a rounded dormer with three sash windows. The interior follows a side hall plan. The house is said to have been built about 1903, and was purchased by Dr. Joseph Erlanger in 1917. It is here that Erlanger raised his family and lived while working at Washington University in St. Louis, until the end of his life. Erlanger, a graduate of Johns Hopkins University, first achieved notice as a cardiologist, but achieved his greatest success in the field of neurophysiology. In collaboration with Herbert Spencer Gasser, he developed apparatus for making detailed sensitive measurements of electrical charges that passed through nerve fibers, establishing a relationship between the level of action potential and the nerve diameter. For this, he and Gasser shared the 1944 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

He plays as defender. Isnan Ali is one of the most well-known seniors in the Indonesian National Team due to his appearances from 2002 to present. His name becomes popular with famous clubs such as PSM Makassar (Junior), Barito Putra, and Sriwijaya F.C. Palembang. When he was young, he showed himself as a talented footballer from attending local adult competitions in his hometown. Fell in love with football after watching Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup, and decided to be a full- time footballer. Full support came from his family as well, \\"Mom and Dad always brought me a soccer ball when they went working.\\" His talent was then tested by enrolling in Sekolah Sepak Bola Bangau Putra on his Upper School years. Isnan Ali then joined PSM Makassar Junior in 1997, one of the high profiled football clubs in Indonesia. He represented Makassar 15 years and up at the Hari Pekan Olahraga Nasional (Haornas) Competition. His football career becomes apparent when he joined Makassar in Pekan Olahraga Daerah (Porda) Makassar in 1997. He scored a decisive goal that brought his team to victory and champion of the tournament. \\"That is the most memorable grand final event for me. I went from behind and did some sprint and I scored with my head.\\" Isnan then joined PT Telecom for two years. However, he was faced with a dilemma went Telecom was going to attend a National competition in Surabaya. One of his senior, Fahri Amiruddin, Mitra Kukar asked him to represent Banjarmasin in PRA PON Banjarmasin to boost his football career. Finally he decided to join Banjarmasin at Pekan Olahraga Nasional. This event opens an opportunity for him to join Barito Putera Banjarmasin in 1999. Young, talented yet he made it to the line up only after a short time of period joining in. Particularly on the second round of the National-A League, Liga Indonesia 1999, Daniel Roekito, the coach of Barito at that time appointed Isnan to join the line up. \\"That was when we play against Solo at Manahan Stadium.\\" After that, he joined the line up every time, although he was still very young. Indeed, the second year with Barito, Isnan was called to join the Senior National team in the World Cup qualifier and Sea Games Malaysia in 2002. With National team status, Isnan joined Persatuan Sepakbola Seluruh Indonesia (PSSI), to attend training center in Singapore, Malaysia and Maldives. \\"Maldives is the most sophisticated country due to its popularity with international soccer stars training and holidaying in that country.\\" With Barito Putra, Isnan qualified in the big 8, 2 years respectively. That was the golden years of Barito, while at the same time, they have Bako Sadissou as the top scorer for the League. Isnan also joined the National Senior team in the Tiger Cup (2002) and achieved the Runner-Up position in that competition. After 2 sessions with Barito Putra, Isnan joined Persikota Tangerang in 2003/2004. He also joined PSSI National training Camp in Sydney, Australia, Bulgaria and Jordan for Asian Cup 2005. In 2005/2006 Isnan Ali signed with neighbor club, Persita Tangerang. One interesting event was his action with Renato Ellyas, a teammate in his subsequent club, Sriwijaya FC. \\"I was in a great stress facing the referee decision that seemed to fix the match and bluntly showed injustices towards my team. However, I have learnt so much from that situation.\\" He did unsportive behavior by giving his middle finger to Renato after given a red card by the referee. In 2006, he was expelled from the National team due to indiscipline behavior with some other senior national team counterparts like Kurniawan Dwi Yulianto. This did not prevent him to raise up to the occasion. In 2007, Isnan Ali joined Sriwijaya F.C. with Rahmad Darmawan as the head of coach. In that year, Isnan made history by taking Double Winners, an achievement that has yet been reached by any other football clubs in Indonesia. Isnan Ali also joined advertisements such as PANONIM and SPECS with Cristian Gonz√°les and other famous footballers from Malaysia. SPECS is a domestic sport products that goes international. This year, Isnan Ali still joined Sriwijaya FC. His professionalism, controversy, personality, achievements and talent have brought him to the top of success. \\"Much have been seen, but much is still to come\\". He hoped to inspire others to represent Indonesia in international levels.

He is known for his genre paintings of scenes from elegant society and portraits of women. He also had a reputation for his humorous depictions of red-robed Catholic cardinals executed in a highly realist style.Witt Library, A checklist of painters c. 1200‚Äì1976 represented in the Witt Library, Courtauld Institute of Art, London, London, Mansell Information Publishing, 1978. Life Georges Croegaert was born in Antwerp. He studied at the Antwerp Academy of Fine Arts. He moved to Paris in 1876 where he remained active as an artist for the rest of his life. He had a successful career as a portrait and genre painter. His paintings received critical acclaim and were sought after by English and American collectors. He exhibited regularly at the Paris Salon between 1882 and 1914 and in Vienna in 1888.Croegaert, Georges (Belgian artist, 1848‚Äì1923), A Blonde , at The National Inventory of Continental European Paintings He died in Paris in 1923 after a long and successful career.Georges Croegaert at Sutcliffe Galleries WorkGeneral= Young lady reading in a japonising interior Croegaert painted initially highly detailed still lifes, bird and flower subjects and occasional outdoor genre scenes. He built a career with his salon portraits of glamorous young women dressed in sumptuous fabrics set in luxurious rooms. He also gained a reputation as the leading artist in the genre of 'cardinal paintings', humorous representations of cardinals engaged in various mundane activities in lavish surroundings. His works are very narrative and the objects in the background support the story of the painting. His paintings are characterized by a high degree of finish and a rich palette.Georges Croegaert (Belgian, 1848‚Äì1923), Femme au Boudoir at Christie‚Äôs =Society portraits= Most of Croegaert‚Äôs portraits of elegant young women are distinguished by their lavish detail. The influence of his relation, Jan Jacob Croegaert-Van Bree, is suspected in the elegance and realism of his style. When he arrived in Paris portrait paintings depicting the lifestyle of contemporary, fashionable city dwellers had become popular. The trend was started in Paris in the late 1850s by the Belgian painter Alfred Stevens and was then adopted by other Belgian painters working in Paris such as Charles Baugniet and Gustave L√©onard de Jonghe and the Frenchman Auguste Toulmouche.John House, Pierre-Auguste Renoir: La Promenade, Getty Publications, 1997, pp. 6‚Äì7 and 26 By the late 1860s there was a ready market for genre scenes with bourgeois figures, usually young glamorous women, depicted in sumptuous surroundings.Manet: Face to face, Courtauld Institute Galleries, Neue Pinakothek (Munich, Germany) Courtauld Institute of Art, 2004, p. 63 With the onset of the Belle Epoque in the 1870s, this type of paintings depicting fashionable women set in an interior became popular at the Paris Salon. The highly realistic depictions of Croegaert of society women have usually a slightly ironic undertone. This is clear in his wink at the contemporary fashions of Japonism and Orientalism in his paintings of Young lady reading in a japonising interior and the Dreams of the Orient, where the women depicted appear overcome by their infatuation with Japanese and Oriental art. =Small- scale portraits= Portrait of an auburn-haired womanIn the last decades of the nineteenth century Croegaert painted a series of small portraits of women rendered in a highly realistic manner. The women are depicted at bust length and appear to melt into the pale unadorned backgrounds. These portraits have generic titles such as A Blonde (Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum, Bournemouth) or Portrait of an Auburn-Haired Woman (Haworth Art Gallery). The artist's usual eye for colour and detail and a concern for the overall effect of design characterize these paintings. =Cardinal paintings= The amateur artist Possibly looking for a lucrative niche in the market, Croegaert started to paint 'cardinal paintings', sometimes also referred to as ‚Äòanti-clerical art‚Äô. These paintings depict Roman Catholic cardinals in a sumptuous setting typically engaging in some banal activity. Georges Croegaert was not the only artist in Paris practicing in this genre. Others who made a name in the genre include the Italian Andrea Landini and the Frenchmen Jehan Georges Vibert, Charles Edouard Delort and Marcel Brunery.Georges Croegaert at Art Now and Then By depicting cardinals participating in activities such as 'approving the artist‚Äôs nude model', card games, excessive or sumptuous eating and drinking and indulgent pastimes such as philately and painting, these painters poked fun at the excessive and sometimes debauched lifestyles of the upper echelons of the Catholic clergy. There was clearly a large demand for these paintings as evidenced by the fact that so many artists worked in this genre. Confidences The tone of Croegaert‚Äôs cardinal paintings was humorous and slightly mocking rather than overtly anti-clerical. Croegaert‚Äôs very detailed technique was perfectly suited for this genre as it allowed him to depict the excesses of the cardinals' lifestyle amid an environment of ornate furnishings, tapestries, glass and silverware rendered in realistic detail. He was particularly accomplished in capturing the vivid reds and purples of the cardinals' robes and the characterisation and humour in the faces of his somewhat pathetic subjects.Georges Croegaert (1848‚Äì1923), A Pair: The Connoisseur and Inspiration at MacConnal-Mason Gallery ReferencesExternal links * Category:Anti-clerical art Category:Belgian genre painters Category:Belgian portrait painters Category:Orientalist painters Category:1923 deaths Category:1848 births Category:19th-century Belgian painters Category:20th-century Belgian painters ","title":"Georges Croegaert"},{"id":"18083808","text":":Map of places in West Dunbartonshire compiled from this list :See the list of places in Scotland for places in other counties.

Conductor pipe is typically set, on petroleum wells, before any drilling operations are performed. It is usually set with special pile-driving or rigs, though the drilling rig is sometimes used to save time and money. Conductor pipe‚Äôs purpose is to protect shallow sands from being contaminated by drilling fluids, and to help prevent washouts (which occur near the surface due to loose and unconsolidated top soils, gravel beds, etc.). In the offshore drilling industry, the conductor pipe is set in the seabed, and is a key structural foundation for the subsea wellhead. When drilling an offshore well, a marine riser is connected to the well, and this is subjected to large environmental forces such as current and waves which are transferred to the conductor. The forces can be large and also cyclical which can potentially cause fatigue damage to the conductor, especially in harsh environmental conditions. A Conductor tensioner unit (CTU) can be used in shallow water on jackup rig to withstand such damaging forces.

It is also known as the Mutual Musicians Association Building or the Musician's Union Local or the Local No. 627 of the American Federation of Musicians. It was a center of the development of the \\"Kansas City Style\\" of jazz, and was immortalized in the song \\"627 Stomp\\". Famous members of the Mutual Musicians Foundation included Count Basie, Bennie Moten, Jay McShann, George F. Lee, singer Julia Lee, trumpeter Hot Lips Page, tenor saxophonists Dick Wilson, Herschel Evans and Lester Young, alto saxophonist Charlie Parker, drummer Baby Lovett, and pianist Pete Johnson. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1981. and It continues to be used as an active performing venue, and also houses a museum. Description and history The Mutual Musicians' Foundation Building is located in downtown Kansas City, on the east side of Highland Avenue between 18th and 19th Streets. It is a two-story masonry structure, built out of pressed brick that has been covered in painted stucco. Originally built as a multiunit residential property, many of its windows have been removed, their openings filled either by bricks or glass blocks. The interior has been extensively altered from its original residential appearance. In the 1920s, Kansas City became a major center for a new style of jazz that resulted from a significant influx of musicians to the city. American Federation of Musicians Local #627 was founded in 1917, and would over a three-decade period have as members many leading jazz musicians of the period. The local sponsored tournaments in which musicians competed, whose proceeds were eventually used to acquire and adapt this building as its headquarters. The \\"Kansas City jazz\\" era ended in 1939, when political reformers gained control of the city and closed many of its clubs and musical establishments. The Mutual Musicians' Foundation, established in 1929 as the Negro Musicians Association, sponsored jam sessions and events here through the 1950s and 1960s, a practice that continues today.

He worked in five games (four in relief) for the 1974 ChiSox, then briefly appeared in two games each as a reliever for the 1975‚Äì1976 White Sox during subsequent recalls from the minors. After spending all of 1977 at Triple-A, he was traded that December to the Cardinals' organization. The Cardinals promoted him from their top affiliate, the Springfield Redbirds, in May 1980 and he worked in 55 games for St. Louis during the next two seasons. He earned his only MLB victory on May 14, 1981, when he pitched a scoreless eighth inning of relief against the Houston Astros. When he entered the game, the Cardinals trailed 6‚Äì3, but in the top of the ninth inning, they rallied for four runs to take the lead, and Baseball Hall of Fame closer Bruce Sutter nailed down the save for a 7‚Äì6 St. Louis triumph. As a Major Leaguer, Otten allowed 150 hits and 67 bases on balls in 118‚Öî innings pitched, with 75 strikeouts. Of his 64 appearances, all but five came in relief.

Description MT Vector was a small motor tanker, built in Manila, Philippines in 1980 as Oil Nic-II, with a tonnage of 629 grt and length of . The tanker was designed to transport petroleum products such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel. Prior to December 1987 the tanker was acquired by Vector Shipping Inc, owned by Francisco Soriano of Manila. Collision with MV Do√±a Paz On 19 December 1987 at about 8:00 p.m., Vector left Limay, Bataan en route to Masbate with a crew of 13, and loaded with 8,800 barrels of petroleum products shipped by the ship's charterer, Caltex Philippines, now Chevron.Strings of Maritime Tragedies The following morning, at about 6:30 a.m., the passenger and cargo ferry Do√±a Paz left the port of Tacloban headed for Manila with a complement of 59 crew members, including the master and his officers, and passengers totaling 1,493 as indicated in the Coast Guard Clearance, though in fact it is estimated to have been well over 4,000. Do√±a Paz was a passenger and cargo vessel owned and operated by Sulpicio Lines, plying the route of Manila/Tacloban/Catbalogan/Manila/Catbalogan/Tacloban/Manila. At about 10:30 p.m. on 20 December 1987, the two vessels collided in the open sea in the vicinity of Dumali Point in Tablas Strait between Marinduque and Oriental Mindoro. As the two vessels collided, Vector's cargo ignited and caused a fire that spilled into the water and rapidly spread to Do√±a Paz, which sank within hours. Vector also sank shortly afterwards. Two of the 13 crew members aboard Vector (Franklin Bornilio and Reynaldo Taripe) survived but all 58 crew of Do√±a Paz died. The official death toll for the ferry is 1,565, although reports indicate the vessel was extremely overcrowded and actual deaths included thousands more. Following investigations the death toll of passengers and crew from both ships was estimated to be 4,386, although admitting that only 1,568 were on the manifest (still more than the licensed maximum of 1,518). The 21 (or 24) survivors from the ferry had to swim, as there was no time to launch lifeboats.\\"Caltex Phil Inc vs Sulpicio Lines Inc : 131166 : September 30, 1999 : J.

The two survivors from Vector's crew said that they were sleeping at the time of the incident. Judgment Vector Shipping was found liable for the crash, while the chartering company, Caltex, was absolved of responsibility. In a judgement on 24 July 2008, The Supreme Court of the Philippines absolved Caltex Philippines (now Chevron) from any liability in the collision between Do√±a Paz and Vector. The decision affirmed the Court of Appeals' ruling against Vector Shipping and its owner Francisco Soriano. gmanews.tv/story, SC absolves Caltex in MV Do√±a Paz tragedy Vector was ordered to reimburse and indemnify Sulpicio Lines Php 800,000.00. This was the total amount due the Macasa family whose kin were among the passengers of MV Do√±a Paz. The Court ruled that \\"MT Vector was unseaworthy at the time of the accident and that its negligence was the cause of the collision that led to the sinking of the Sulpicio vessel.\\"Vector Shipping Ordered to Pay Sulpicio Lines for 1987 Maritime Tragedy A former captain told investigators that the rudder was defective and that it took two men to steer the wheel.

The band was active from 1995 through 2007. They were signed to SideOneDummy Records. Their releases on SideOneDummy were Funeral for a Feeling (2001), a split with 7 Seconds in 2004, and From Companionship to Competition (2005). Other notable releases by the band were No Gimmicks Needed and This is just the beginning... which were released on the New York hardcore label Blackout! records, owned and operated by Bill Wilson. The band released many 7\\" EPs, splits with other bands (including Full Speed Ahead, Fisticuffs, Voorhees, Good Riddance, and Poison Idea), compilation tracks, and full-length LPs in their 11-year run. Most of their records were released on vinyl as well as compact disc. Some were released on different colors of vinyl, different sleeve covers, hand numbered tour presses, and picture discs, making their records a favorite among collectors. They cite Poison Idea, Negative Approach, Sheer Terror, Agnostic Front, Minor Threat, Warzone, Sick of It All, and 7 Seconds as some of their influences. KYI was very fast and had a loud, dirty, dual guitar sound with shouted vocals. They employed hints of melody in their song structure. Although they derived many of their influences from California and D.C. style hardcore, they were considered a New York hardcore band.  History  Kill Your Idols took its name from a Situated Chaos song of the same name. Situated Chaos was a Long Island hardcore band that existed in the late 1990s. Founding members Andy West and Gary Bennett chose the name because the lyrics of the song reflected how they felt about hardcore. Also, Andy and Gary were introduced to one another and asked about forming an old-school hardcore band by a mutual friend named Vinnie Segerra, who was the frontman of Situated Chaos. Segerra also ran a DIY (\\"Do it yourself\\") label called Mint-Tone Records, which released a 7\\" EP by Gary's first band Big Sniff, which was also melodic hardcore. After the band broke up, Vinnie put him in touch with Andy. Vinnie Segerra played a big role in the beginning of KYI. Once they released their first demo, which was recorded at their first live performance at CBGB, Vinnie got them their first record deal with Bitter Sweet Records. After the label was shut down, KYI was forced to bring the masters of their first, self- financed studio recording to another common acquaintance in the hardcore scene. Brett Clarin of Long Island's None Of The Above Records came to the band's rescue, and the \\"12 inch EP\\" was released. The band then booked their first-ever summer tour down the east coast of the United States. It wasn't long after when the band was signed to Bill Wilson's Blackout! label. For the next six or seven years, the band toured relentlessly across the United States, parts of Canada, Europe, and even a short tour in Japan and Korea. The band toured with many other important hardcore/punk bands of the day including H2O, Good Riddance, The Casualties, 7 Seconds, Agnostic Front, Death by Stereo, The Nerve Agents, Kid Dynamite, and many others. Along the way, the band was picked up by Joe Sib and Bill Armstrong's SideOneDummy Records, a major independent based in California. This afforded the band more widespread distribution, college radio play, and offers to tour with much bigger bands and play much larger venues. By this time, the band was almost completely burned out from the road, and took to only playing locally, mostly at CBGB, and recording from time to time. Interest in other musical projects and family life soon contributed to the breakup of the group. They played their final shows in May 2007 in Philadelphia, New Jersey, and New York. Their last show ever was held at a VFW hall in eastern Long Island. Right before the band went on, the show was raided by local police and fire officials and was shut down due to over-occupancy. Local hardcore fans and friends of the band quickly reorganized the event later the same night in the parking lot of a band rehearsal space in an industrial area. Complete with a P.A. system and full backline, the band ripped through as many of their songs as they could before the police arrived again. Throughout their career, KYI earned a small but loyal grassroots following of underground punk and hardcore fans. Most of KYI's songs dealt with depression, anxiety, the pain of loss, day-to-day problems, and the social politics of the punk scene. The band prided themselves on their DIY ethic, and largely worked with similarly oriented promoters and record labels. The band never took on a manager, and only took on a booking agent for a short time when their touring schedule was at its peak. Kill Your Idols reunited to play the Black 'N' Blue Bowl at Webster Hall on Sunday, May 19, 2013. In 2015, Kill Your Idols reunited on Friday, March 20 to play a sold out show at Saint Vitus Bar in Brooklyn, NY as a benefit for Nate Gluck from Ensign. They will also play on Saturday, March 21 to play Nate Fest a benefit for Nate Gluck from Ensign, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2014.  Other projects  Members of Kill Your Idols have continued to play music since the breakup of the band. Paul Delaney joined None More Black, leaving KYI for approximately two years to pursue his time with them, only to come back to KYI and finish off the final European tour and the last Stateside shows. Deathcycle is a hardcore/metal/punk crossover band founded by Gary Bennett and Ron Grimaldi, with Paul Delaney joining the ranks somewhere along the way. Celebrity Murders is a hardcore/metal band founded by Mike D'Lorenzo and Brian Meehan. S.S.S.P. (Skinheads Still Scare People) is a hardcore/Oi! style project founded by Vinnie Value and Mike De Lorenzo. All of these bands were operating toward the end of KYI's tenure. More recently, black metal band, Black Anvil, was formed by KYI members Paul Delaney, Gary Bennett, and Raeph.

Teri is 38 miles from Kohat. Situated four (4) miles west of Kohat-Bannu road, Teri is the oldest Khattak town. It is one of the important Khattak towns along with Lachi and Gumbat and Akora Khattak. Teri is situated beside the Toi (river of that name. There is open well- cultivated valley between Teri and the hills to the north. The town is close to the Toi and is well situated on a rising ground overlooking the surrounding country. Teri is a large valley situated between Mirandaey (Mirandi) and Thuwaanraey (Sawani) Ghaar mountain range. These are the two highest mountain ranges of Khattak-nama. The different spellings of Teri in the old books of English surveyors are as follows starting from the oldest one: 1. Teri 2. Terri 3. Tiraey 4. Teeree There is one old temple of Advaitanand Ji in Teri. Till 1956, Teri was a princely state ruled by Nawab of Teri. Teri State had an area of 1616 square miles comprising a) present Karak District: Banda Daudshah Tehsil, Karak Tehsil, Takht-e-Nasrati Tehsil and b) half of present Kohat District: LachiTehsil and Gumbat area. Teri State was divided into following Tappas (satrapies): 1. Teri, 2. Senaey Khwarram (part of present Banda Daudshah Tehsil, part of Lachi Tehsil and Gumbat area) 3. Barak (present Takht-e-Nasrati Tehsil and Karak Tehsil) Teri State's Barak area was divided into two parts topographically: 1. Tsavatra- Chauntra or the elevated territory (most of Banda Daudshah Tehsil and most of Karak Tehsil) 2. Taal or the sandy plains (Takht-e-Nasrati Tehsil and part of Karak Tehsil, Latambararea) Tsavatra is from the Hindi word Chauntra. Chauntra means elevated land. This is a common terminology in Punjab. Taal is again from the Hindi word Thall-Tal, meaning sand. Thall Desert of Sindh Sagar Doab is an example. Another example is of the famous Thar Desert of Sindh, Pakistan. Here the last consonant ‚Äòl‚Äô changes to ‚Äòr‚Äô. History Of Khattak's And Establishment Of Teri State The first mentioning of the Khattak tribe in history is that they migrated from Shawal Mountain Range (now inhabited by Waziris). Their chief, Malik Akor Khan first established himself at Karbogha, a village of Tall Tehsil, Hangu District, north-west of Teri. Malik Akor Khan then moved in a north-east direction and settled at the bank of Kabul River, Landaey Daryab (short river). The town of Akora Khattak was founded by Malik Akor Khan. It was the first capital of Khattak's. Mughal Emperor, Akbar while on a visit to Peshawar made Malik Akor Khan a government servant and charged him with the responsibility of collecting tolls from the caravans on the crossing of the Indus at Attock. Malik Akor Khan was the grandfather of the famous warrior-poet, Khushal Khan Khattak. Malik Akor Khan Originator of Akor Khel dynasty Ruled from 1550 Died in 1600 The chief of Khattaks used to sit at Akora and his deputy used to be at Teri.

A small French force under the command of capitaine de vaisseau Henri Rivi√®re attacked a strong Black Flag defensive position near the village of C·∫ßu Gi·∫•y a few miles to the west of Hanoi, known to the French as Paper Bridge (Pont de Papier). After initial successes, the French were eventually enveloped on both wings, and were only with difficulty able to regroup and fall back to Hanoi. Rivi√®re and several other senior officers were killed in the action.Bastard, 171‚Äì89; Baude de Maurceley, 190‚Äì210; Duboc, 123‚Äì39; Huard, 6‚Äì16; de Marolles, 193‚Äì222; Nicolas, 257‚Äì62; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 152‚Äì7; Histoire militaire, 55‚Äì8  Background  French marine infantryman in Tonkin, 1883 French interest in northern Vietnam dated from the 1860s, when France annexed several southern provinces of Vietnam to become the colony of Cochinchina, laying the foundations for its later colonial empire in Indochina. French explorers followed the course of the Red River through northern Vietnam to its source in Yunnan, arousing hopes that a profitable overland trade route could be established with China, bypassing the treaty ports of the Chinese coastal provinces.Thomazi, La conqu√™te de l‚ÄôIndochine, 105‚Äì7 The main obstacle to the realisation of this dream was the Black Flag Army, a well-organized bandit force under a formidable leader, Liu Yongfu (Liu Yung-fu, ÂäâÊ∞∏Á¶è), which was levying exorbitant dues on trade on the Red River between S∆°n T√¢y and the town of L√†o Cai on the Yunnan border. French intervention in northern Vietnam was precipitated by Commandant Henri Rivi√®re, who was sent with a small French military force to Hanoi at the end of 1881 to investigate Vietnamese complaints against the activities of French merchants.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 140‚Äì57 In defiance of the instructions of his superiors, Rivi√®re stormed the citadel of Hanoi on 25 April 1882.Bastard, 152‚Äì4; Marolles, 75‚Äì92; Nicolas, 249‚Äì52 Although Rivi√®re subsequently returned the citadel to Vietnamese control, his recourse to force was greeted with alarm in both Vietnam and China.Eastman, 51‚Äì7 The Vietnamese government, unable to confront Rivi√®re with its own ramshackle army, enlisted the help of Liu Yongfu, whose well-trained and seasoned Black Flag soldiers were to prove a thorn in the side of the French. The Black Flags had already inflicted one humiliating defeat on a French force commanded by lieutenant de vaisseau Francis Garnier in 1873. Like Rivi√®re in 1882, Garnier had exceeded his instructions and attempted to intervene militarily in northern Vietnam. Liu Yongfu had been called in by the Vietnamese government, and ended a remarkable series of French victories against the Vietnamese by defeating Garnier‚Äôs small French force beneath the walls of Hanoi. Garnier was killed in this battle, and the French government later disavowed his expedition.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 116‚Äì31 The Vietnamese also bid for Chinese support. Vietnam had long been a tributary state of China, and China agreed to arm and support the Black Flags and to covertly oppose French operations in Tonkin. The Qing court also sent a strong signal to the French that China would not allow Tonkin to fall under French control. In the summer of 1882 troops of the Chinese Yunnan and Guangxi armies crossed the border into Tonkin, occupying L·∫°ng S∆°n, B·∫Øc Ninh, H∆∞ng H√≥a and other towns.Lung Chang, 90‚Äì91; Marolles, 133‚Äì44 The French minister to China, Fr√©d√©ric Bour√©e, was so alarmed by the prospect of war with China that in November and December 1882 he negotiated a deal with the Chinese statesman Li Hongzhang to divide Tonkin into French and Chinese spheres of influence. The Vietnamese were not consulted by either party to these negotiations.Eastman, 57‚Äì65  Nam Dinh and Gia Cuc  Liu Yongfu (1837‚Äì1917) Henri Rivi√®re (1827‚Äì83) Rivi√®re was disgusted at the deal cut by Bour√©e, and in early 1883 decided to force the issue. He had recently been sent a battalion of marine infantry from France, giving him just enough men to venture beyond Hanoi. On 27 March 1883, to secure his line of communications from Hanoi to the coast, Rivi√®re captured the citadel of Nam ƒê·ªãnh with a force of 520 French soldiers under his personal command.Marolles, 178‚Äì92 During his absence at Nam Dinh the Black Flags and Vietnamese made an attack on Hanoi, but they were repulsed by chef de bataillon Berthe de Villers in the Battle of Gia Cuc on 28 March.Huard, 26‚Äì30 Rivi√®re was jubilant: 'This will force them to take forward their Tonkin Question!' In April 1883 the Chinese civil mandarin Tang Jingsong, who had been sent to Vietnam in 1882 to assess the Vietnamese government's ability to resist French encroachment in Tonkin, reconciled the quarrel between Liu and Hoang and persuaded Liu to take the field in earnest with the Black Flag Army. Liu's decision to commit the Black Flag Army against the French was to have profound consequences, setting in train a chain of events that culminated eventually in the Sino-French War (August 1884‚ÄìApril 1885).Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 53‚Äì5 The Battle of Paper Bridge was precipitated by a challenge by Liu Yongfu, who posted up placards in Hanoi on 10 May 1883 daring Rivi√®re to come out and meet the Black Flag Army in the open field. Rivi√®re believed that French prestige required him to respond to this challenge, and at dawn on 19 May led a column of around 450 French soldiers and sailors to attack the Black Flag Army in its positions at Phu Hoai, a few miles west of Hanoi. The column consisted of two companies of marine infantry, the landing companies of the French warships Victorieuse and Villars, and three artillery pieces.Rivi√®re‚Äôs column included the 31st Company, 2nd Marine Infantry Regiment (Captain Caboureau), the 24th Company, 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment (Captain Jacquin), the landing companies of Victorieuse and Villars (lieutenants de vaisseau Pelletier de Ravini√®res and Sentis), 20 Cochinchinese riflemen (2nd Lieutenant Daim), two 65-millimetre cannon and a Hotchkiss canon-revolver (lieutenant de vaisseau Piss√®re and enseigne de vaisseau Le Bris), a small field hospital and a demolition party (capitaine de g√©nie Gu√©not). Rivi√®re left a small garrison at Hanoi, consisting of the 29th Company, 2nd Marine Infantry Regiment (Captain Retrouvey), the landing company of Hamelin (enseigne de vaisseau de Dri√©sen), 19 marine artillery gunners and troops unfit to march. The French plan was discovered by Liu Yongfu's spies, and the Black Flag Army ambushed the French column near the village of C·∫ßu Gi·∫•y at Paper Bridge (Pont de Papier), a bridge across a small river that took its name from a nearby paper mill. The Black Flags were deployed just to the west of Paper Bridge, in the villages of Trung Thong, Ha Yen Ke and Thien Thong. All three villages were surrounded by thick bamboo groves and clumps of trees, providing excellent cover for the Black Flags and also allowing Liu Yongfu to manoeuvre his men without being observed by the French.  The battle of Paper Bridge The French column set out from Hanoi at dawn and reached Paper Bridge at around 7.30 a.m. Rivi√®re was unwell, and the column was under the direct command of chef de bataillon Berthe de Villers, an excellent professional soldier who had won a spectacular victory against the Vietnamese only seven weeks earlier at the Battle of Gia Cuc. While crossing the bridge, the French vanguard came under fire from Black Flag skirmishers. Berthe de Villers immediately deployed his men into line and pushed forward against the Black Flags, clearing them from the villages of Ha Yen Ke and Thien Thong. Liu Yongfu brought up his reserves, waited until the enemy line was fully committed, and launched a sudden counterattack against the French right wing. A Black Flag regiment trotted smartly into position with rifles at the slope, deployed into line, knelt down and fired a series of accurate volleys at close range. Berthe de Villers was mortally wounded in this engagement, and Rivi√®re assumed direct command of the French column. To avoid being encircled, Rivi√®re ordered his men to retreat and regroup on the far side of Paper Bridge. The French retreat was initially conducted in good order, by echelons, and was covered by the three French cannon. However, disaster struck when one of the cannons overturned with the force of its recoil. Rivi√®re and his officers rushed forward to help the gunners to right it, and the Black Flags fired a volley into this struggling mass of men. The volley killed one French officer and wounded Rivi√®re and several of his aides. Seeing the French line in confusion, the Black Flags surged forward and drove back the French rearguard. During the fighting Rivi√®re was killed. Complete catastrophe was only averted by the coolness of lieutenant de vaisseau Piss√®re, who assumed command of the demoralised French column, deployed the French infantry behind a dyke on the eastern side of Paper Bridge, and beat off a number of attempts by the Black Flags to cross the bridge and follow up their victory. The battle eventually died down, and Piss√®re marched the defeated French column back to Hanoi in good order.  Casualties  Chef de bataillon Berthe de Villers (1844‚Äì83), mortally wounded at Paper Bridge French casualties in the Battle of Paper Bridge were 5 officers and 30 men killed, and 6 officers and 46 men wounded. Besides Rivi√®re himself, the dead included chef de bataillon Berthe de Villers, Captain Jacquin, lieutenant de vaisseau H√©ral de Brisis and Midshipman Moulun.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 157 Casualties in the Black Flag Army were around 50 dead and 56 wounded out of around 1,500 men engaged, and included two battalion commanders, Yang Zhu'en (Ê•äËëóÊÅ©) and Wu Fengdian (Âê≥È≥≥ÂÖ∏).Lung Chang, 127; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 157  Significance  Paper Bridge (Pont de Papier) The battle was a serious defeat for the French, but its ultimate result was to strengthen the resolve of Jules Ferry's administration to entrench the French protectorate in Tonkin. The news of Rivi√®re's defeat and death reached Paris on 26 May, and the French navy minister Admiral Peyron declared 'France will avenge her glorious children!' The Chamber of Deputies immediately voted a credit of three and a half million francs to finance the despatch of a strong expeditionary corps to Tonkin.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 158‚Äì60 In later years a reaction set in. Some critics questioned Rivi√®re's tactics at Paper Bridge, suggesting that he had lost the battle because he had been too impetuous. In particular, he was faulted for accepting battle so readily and for exposing his guns to capture by placing them too far forward. In the 1930s Colonel Alfred Thomazi, the historian of the French conquest of Indochina, did his best to rebut such criticisms: > If Rivi√®re had been more prudent and withdrawn his column as soon as he had > crossed the bridge, when Berthe de Villers was wounded, our losses would > have been smaller and the engagement would have remained indecisive. But he > had marched out to disengage Hanoi and strike a heavy blow at the encircling > enemy. To fall back at the first contact would have been to lose face, to > encourage the boldness of the Black Flags, and to expose the town to attacks > which even a modest success could prevent. And, given the results of the > preceding skirmishes, such a success seemed certain. And were we not, by > now, used to miracles? In Tonkin, as previously in Cochinchina, victory > seemed the invariable reward for boldness. Henri Rivi√®re, a Parisian who > considered himself anything but romantic, a writer who was also a man of > action, died a hero, like Francis Garnier, for believing that nothing was > impossible.

Playing career Born in Sundsvall, Sweden, Erixon played junior hockey with local team Timra IK. In 2004‚Äì05, he debuted at the under-18 level as a 15-year-old, playing two games in the J18 Allsvenskan. The following season, he dressed for 14 J18 games, recording three goals and two assists. He also competed with a regional all-star team from Medelpad in the annual TV-pucken, an under-15 national tournament, and notched two assists over four games. In 2006‚Äì07, Erixon moved on to Timra's J20 SuperElit team at 17 years old; he recorded 13 points (6 goals and 7 assists) over 39 games. His efforts also saw him debut with the men's team in Sweden's premiere Elitserien, dressing for two games. Erixon then split the 2007‚Äì08 season between Timra in the Elitserien (pointless in 27 games) and IF Sundsvall of the second-tier HockeyAllsvenskan on a loan (7 points over 23 games). He became a full-time Elitserien player beginning in 2008‚Äì09 and recorded back- to-back 7-point campaigns. After a breakout 20-point season in 2010‚Äì11 (leading all team defencemen in scoring), Erixon was signed as an undrafted and unrestricted free agent in the National Hockey League (NHL) by the Vancouver Canucks on April 20, 2011. Joining the Canucks for his first NHL training camp in September 2011, he was assigned to the team's minor league affiliate, the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League (AHL). During the season Erixon was traded to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for Andrew Gordon. Injury prevented Erixon appearing with the Ducks organization before he returned to Timra the following season. International play Erixon made his international debut with Sweden at the 2007 IIHF World U18 Championships in Finland. He recorded one assist over six games, helping Sweden to a bronze medal.

Prior to her sinking, she listed to her port side, a sign which was inconsequential until 5 years later. Sinking On September 18, 1998, the Princess of the Orient sailed from Manila to Cebu during typhoon Vicki. Two hours after leaving the Manila harbor, the ferry suddenly tilted to its port side and was unable to recover. The ship capsized at 12:55 a.m. near Fortune Island and sank. Of the 388 passengers on board, 150 were killed. Survivors floated at sea for more than 12 hours before rescuers were able to reach them.\\"Strings of Maritime Tragedies\\" Wreck The wreck is resting on her Port side at below sea level near Fortune Island. In the early 2000s, John Bennett and Ron Loos made the first scuba dives to the wreck site. It appeared probable that the cause of the sinking was due to the cargo on the ship was not properly lashed. The rough seas from Typhoon Vicki caused the cargo of the ship to shift, thus causing the ship to list to one side, resulting in the sinking.

It was launched on 10 June 2008 by President Mwai Kibaki. Its objective is to help transform Kenya into a \\"newly industrializing, middle-income country providing a high quality of life to all its citizens by 2030 in a clean and secure environment.\\" Developed through \\"an all-inclusive and participatory stakeholder consultative process, involving Kenyans from all parts of the country,\\" the Vision is based on three \\"pillars\\": Economic, Social, and Political. The Vision's adoption comes after the country's GDP growth went from 0.6% in 2002 to 6.1% in 2006, under Kibaki's Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (ERS). The Kenya Vision 2030 is to be implemented in successive five-year plans, with the first such plan covering the period 2008‚Äì2012. Under the Vision, Kenya expected to meet its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the deadline in 2015, although this has not been achieved. The Vision 2030 development process was launched by President Mwai Kibaki on 30 October 2006 when he instructed the National Vision Steering Committee to produce a medium-term plan with full details on the development programmes that would be implemented in the first five years after the ERS expires on 31 December 2007. A consultative approach was undertaken through workshops with stakeholders from all levels of the public service, the private sector, civil society, the media and NGOs while in rural areas, provincial consultative forums were also held throughout the country. The objective of all these consultations was to provide an in-depth understanding of the country's development problems and the necessary strategies to achieve the 2030 goals. A similar process and methodology was followed in identifying projects and priorities in the social and political pillars. Detailed analysis was carried out under a consultative process in order to come up with strategies capable of resolving the social and political problems that Kenyans face today. To arrive at workable solutions, the team of experts learned as much as they could from countries that have achieved rapid growth and also improved the lives of their people greatly in a span of 20‚Äì30 years, The team made extensive use of information available from the government, Kenya's private sector, civil society and universities. Foundations The Vision 2030 strategy focus on reforms and development across 10 key sectors: * Infrastructure. * Science, Technology and Innovation. * Public Sector Reforms. * Tourism. * Agriculture. * Trade. * Manufacturing. * BPO(Business Process Outsourcing) & ICT(Information Communication & Technology). * Financial Services. * Education & Training. PillarsEconomic= This aims at improving the prosperity of all Kenyans through an economic development programme, covering all the regions of Kenya. It aims to achieve an average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 10% per annum beginning in 2012. To achieve this target, Kenya is continuing with the tradition of macro-economic stability that has been established since 2002. It is also addressing other key constraints, notably, a low savings to GDP ratio, which can be alleviated by drawing in more remittances from Kenyans abroad, as well as increased foreign investment and overseas development assistance (ODA). Delivering the country's ambitious growth aspirations required a rise of national savings from 17% in 2006 to about 30% in 2012. It was also found necessary to deal with a significant informal economy employing 75% of the country's workers. The informal sector is being supported in ways that will raise productivity and distribution and increase jobs, owner's incomes and public revenues. Kenya has recorded an economic growth of 5.7 percent in the first quarter of year 2018. This has been attributed to the trickle down effect of the \\" Handshake \\" leading to stabilized political environment.The country is continuing with the governance and institutional reforms necessary to accelerate economic growth. Other critical problems being addressed include poor infrastructure and high energy costs. The six key sectors described below are being given priority as the key growth drivers for achievement of the economic vision: * Tourism and mining * Increasing value in agriculture * A better and more inclusive wholesale and retail trade sector * Manufacturing for the regional market * B P O (Business Process Outsourcing) * Financial services It is notable that with each Government comes spheres of interest but with the change of guard this has not been necessarily so in Kenya. The New administration of Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta has rather picked some key economic deliverables in the vision in what in 2018 he has characterized as \\"The Big Four\\" being within the framework of Vision 2030. These are #Universal Healthcare, #Manufacturing, #Affordable Housing and #Food Security, These key pillars were as a result of the hotly contested elections of 2017 that led to an annulment of the Presidential vote by the country's Supreme Court led by Chief Justice Maraga. Notwithstanding same over 10,000 km s of road are to be tarmacked in the period 2013 to 2022 with 3000 km in progress by 2018! SGR (Standard gauge Railway) modernisation of Kenya Railway system on the southern Corridor phase 1 is complete from Mombasa to Nairobi while phase 2 Nairobi to Naivasha is in progress as of May 2018; with the longest Rail tunnel in Africa at Kibiko, Ngong in advanced stages! Tendering of 3Rd phase is in Progress . Under Lappset A key deliverable Under vision 2030, Isiolo Airport is complete as of 2017, while Konza City and Lamu Port have received renewed interest In #2018. Either Road works completed under vision 2030 include Mombasa Road, with major funds still being pumped in, Thika Super Highway or commonly known as( Kibaki Free Way ) due its convenience, Outerring Road, Southern Bypass, Eastern By pass and Northern Bypass. Others include Ngong Road expansion and Langata road expansion. Major malls with grade one offices in what has been characterized as Public Private partnership have been constructed and completed in Nairobi and its environs. This include Garden city and TRM on Thika Superhighway, Two Rivers along the Northern And southern Bypasses. Even so, the advent of Devolution with 47 county governments has thrust Kenya into one investment destination with individual Counties competing to bring investors within their borders and or regions. This has become a major catalyst for growth as county headquarters have become new centres of growth even as key roads get opened as the case of Marsabit, an oasis in a desert after completion of Isiolo- Marsabit to Ethiopia border Highway a part of Cape Cairo Pan African Highway. This among many such regional projects in progress is positioning every region in Kenya and the neighboring countries to Profit from Vision 2030, a brainchild of 3Rd president of Kenya H.E Emilio Mwai Kibaki EGH and His Rainbow team! Vision 2030, A vision that showed the dreams and aspirations of Kenyans remains on course. However Financing gaps remain and hold an ugly face to its successful completion. This challenges have been unmasked even more by unchecked corruption that continues to bedevil the East African State. Either the Funding from China has come as a blessing in disguise with Chinese loans and Money being better utilised under Chinese expatriates in projects ranging from airports, rail, road and increasingly trade. These has included major expansions of JKIA(Jomo Kenyatta international Airport) Moi airport Kisumu and Nairobi-Nakuru high way still in progress. Major roads in Kisumu, Mombasa and Nairobi are currently under major expansions as per vision 2030. Even more expansion of infrastructure in both the Northern and Southern Transport Corridor is currently in progress. This has included projects in power with renewable energy taking centre stage with geothermal in Okario, Naivasha and wind mills in Ngong Hills, Turkana and Marsabit. A major reliance of the country's power need is now in renewable energy sources with the country eager to attract funds from international partners as the tightening of monetary policy becomes severe post 2017 interest capping regime in Kenya's Banking sector. This has seen China emerge as the biggest holder of Kenyan foreign debt at more than 60% in May 2018 at over Ksh 700 billion. Indeed, the Chinese have partnered with Kenya towards attainment of vision 2030 goals. Investments in Technological hubs have led to Nairobi being termed as Africa's silicone Savannah with products such as Mpesa getting acclaimed globally. Developments in ICT have seen government services, financial services become more inclusive with introduction of services such as Huduma Centres, Lipa na Mpesa. This has made Kenya jump directly from agricultural revolution to Information revolution within a decade. Industrialisation as per the big four that entails quality life for all Kenya's, has received renewed focus as per the big four agenda of the Jubilee Government of Kenyatta the second! Exploitation of Mineral wealth with major discoveries in Gold, oil, coal, Rare earths etc. with tens of trillions of shillings worth present a big boast towards funding of this ambitious Vision. The future of Kenya has never been any brighter! =Social= Through this strategy, Kenya aims to build a just and cohesive society with social equity in a clean and secure environment. It, therefore, presents comprehensive social interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of all Kenyans and Kenyan residents. This strategy makes special provisions for Kenyans with various disabilities (PWDs) and previously marginalized communities. These policies (and those in the economic pillar) are equally anchored on an all- round adoption of science, technology and innovation (STI) as an implementation tool. Key sectors: * Education & training * The health system and maternal health * Water and sanitation * The environment * Housing and urbanization * Gender, youth and vulnerable groups * Equity and poverty elimination * Reconciliation =Political= This aims to realize a democratic political system founded on issue-based politics that respects the rule of law, and protects the rights and freedoms of every individual in Kenyan society. It hopes to transform Kenya into a state in which equality is entrenched, irrespective of one's race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or socioeconomic status; a nation that respects and harnesses the diversity of its peoples‚Äô values, traditions, and aspirations for the benefit of all its citizens. The political pillar vision for 2030 is ‚Äúa democratic political system that is issue-based, people-centered, result-oriented and accountable to the public‚Äù. An issue-based system is one in which political differences are about means to meet the widest public interest. ‚ÄúPeople-centered‚Äù goals refer to the system's responsiveness to the needs and rights of citizens, whose participation in all public policies and resource allocation processes are both fully appreciated and facilitated. A result-oriented system is stable, predictable and whose performance is based on measurable outcomes. An accountable system is one that is open and transparent and one that permits the free flow of information. This vision is expected to guarantee Kenya's attainment of the specific goals outlined under Vision 2030's economic and social pillars To meet objectives outlined in the economic and social pillars, Kenya's national governance system is being transformed and reformed to acquire high-level executive capability consistent with a rapidly industrializing country. The country is adopting a democratic decentralization process with substantial devolution in policy-making, public resource management, and revenue sharing through devolved funds. This has been achieved through the delivery of a new constitutional dispensation which came in effect in August 2010. Transformation within Kenya's political governance system under Vision 2030 is expected to take place across six strategic initiatives, whose overarching visions, goals and specific strategies for 2012 are as follows: * Rule of law * Electoral & political processes * Democracy and public service delivery * Transparency and accountability * Security, peacebuilding and conflict management Guiding principles To ensure that economic, social and political governance gains made under the Vision are neither reversed nor lost as a result of change in ruling parties, the following eight governance principles will be adhered to: # Constitutional supremacy: Supremacy of the constitution shall be respected at all times. Political and property rights are guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. # Sovereignty of the people: The government derives all its just powers from the people it governs. # Equality of citizens: Kenya will not discriminate any citizen on the basis of gender, race, tribe, religion or ancestral origin. # National values, goals and ideology: Kenyans shall formulate and adopt a core set of national values, goals and a political ideology supportive of Vision 2030, these will include acknowledgement of the significance of God to the Kenyan people and an affirmation of the religious, cultural and ethnic diversity of Kenyans. It will also affirm the indivisibility of Kenya as a nation and her commitment to democracy and the rule of law. # A viable political party system: Kenya aims at a political party system that will be guided by policy and ideological differences rather than region of ethnicity. Founding of political parties on religious, linguistic, racial, ethnic, gender, corporate or regional basis will be prohibited. All political parties will be obliged to subscribe to a legally-binding Code of Conduct. There will be a clear definition of circumstances under which a party may be de- registered or reinstated. The delegation of state functions to (or the use of state resources by) political parties will not be permitted. Political parties will be required to publish their manifestos before participating in elections. # Public participation in governance: Kenyans shall appreciate the values of tolerance and respect for differences in opinion in a competitive society. # Separation of powers: Legislature, the Executive and Judiciary institutions are independently functioning in a manner that enhances the implementation of Vision 2030. # Decentralisation: Vision 2030 uses devolved funds to strengthen decentralization of development projects at the community level. Implementation A Semi Autonomous Government Agency (SAGA) with the requisite capacity has been established to oversee the implementation of all the Vision 2030 projects. The agency works closely in collaboration with public and private sector, civil society and other relevant stakeholder groups. The strategies to deliver the 10% annual growth by 2012 is being executed through flagship projects across the priority sectors in all the three pillars of the Vision. The projects are original large-scale initiatives that look beyond their immediate locality. Flagship projects form part of the national development with complementary projects being undertaken in line with the medium-term plans, the budget outlook paper, and the medium-term expenditure framework. During the life of the Vision, strategies and action plans are expected to be systematically reviewed and adjusted every 5 years in order to respond to the changing environment. Following the expiry of the ERS in December 2007, the first part of Vision 2030 is now being implemented under the 2008-2012 plan. On July 23, 2013 the Ministry of Information and Communication launched the National Broadband Strategy, with the stated goal \\"Broadband connectivity that is always on and that delivers a minimum of 5mbps to homes and businesses for high speed access to voice, data, video and applications for development.\\"The National Broadband Strategy (draft) Vision Delivery Secretariat The Kenyan Government has created a Vision Delivery Secretariat (VDS), which provides leadership and direction to realize the Vision 2030 goals.

Once the beneficiary of the RESP enrolls in a qualified educational program, then the beneficiary receives the balance in the account through Educational Assistance Payments. If the beneficiary of the RESP does not enroll in an educational program after high school, then the CLB payments must be returned to the Canadian federal government because the CLB is not transferable.

Although sisters, their full stage names were Sue Glover and Sunny Leslie. For three years they were members of British pop group The Brotherhood of Man. Career Born Yvonne Wheatman ('Sue') and Heather Wheatman ('Sunny') in Madras, India, they made their recording debut together in 1963 under the name The Myrtelles, with their cover version of Lesley Gore's \\"Just Let Me Cry\\" on the independent Oriole record label. The single was not successful. The girls then released two singles under the name of Sue and Sunshine before settling on the name Sue and Sunny. Whilst recording with songwriter and producer Kenny Lynch the girls changed their name to The Stockingtops at his request, but decided it was not for them and reverted to Sue and Sunny. In 1965, they sang backing vocals on Alex Harvey's single \\"Agent OO Soul\\" / \\"Go Away Baby\\" (Fontana ‚Äì TF 610), produced by Chris Blackwell of Island Records. In 1966, when Sunny (the younger of the pair) was still only 15, the two turned professional doing the cabaret circuit. After three years they decided that their audiences were too old for them, and went to Germany to play the airbase circuit, where, despite releasing two German singles, they still felt out of place and returned to London. Whilst in London they were asked to do a session as backing singers for Lesley Duncan. The session went well and suddenly the duo found themselves in demand, recording with, amongst many others, The Ace Kefford Stand, Dusty Springfield, Elton John, Cerrone, Love Affair, Lulu, Mott the Hoople, Peter Wyngarde, T. Rex, Tom Jones, David Bowie and Joe Cocker. It was the Cocker sessions, and in particular \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", where Sunny sang with Madeline Bell and Rosetta Hightower, that propelled the girls into the limelight. When \\"With A Little Help\\" reached number one in the UK Singles Chart they found themselves accompanying Cocker on several television programmes including Top of the Pops. They now found themselves working with artists as diverse as James Last, Frank Zappa, Giorgio Moroder, and Brotherhood of Man, with whom they charted in 1970 with the hit single, \\"United We Stand\\". In March 1972, they just missed the UK top 30 with the single \\"Third Finger, Left Hand\\", released under the name The Pearls, a group name that was more successful with the personnel of Lyn Cornell and Ann Simmons. Sue and Sunny themselves are a little unsure of how many records they have actually released. In an interview with Disc on sale on 20 April 1974, Sunny was quoted as saying \\"Sue and I found ourselves recording on our own and we had a couple of singles put out. But nothing really happened for us\\". In fact they appear to have recorded around a dozen singles, but to confuse things further they also recorded under the names Sue & Sunshine, The Stockingtops, and as part of The Nirvana Orchestra. They also recorded an album for CBS which was, confusingly, also released ‚Äì with a different cover ‚Äì on the CBS subsidiary, Reflection. Sunny finally had a hit record with \\"Doctor's Orders\\" in 1974, and in 1976 Sue, now known as 'Sue Glover' recorded a solo album for DJM, entitled Solo. On three occasions, Sue and Sunny have sung backing vocals at the Eurovision Song Contest. In 1969, they accompanied Lulu to victory in Madrid, performing \\"Boom Bang-a-Bang\\". They returned to support Joy Fleming in Stockholm, in 1975, joining Madeline Bell to back up the German entry \\"Ein Lied kann eine Br√ºcke sein\\", which placed seventeenth. In 1981 Sue resurfaced with an entry in the UK Song for Europe competition fronting the group 'Unity' with the song \\"For Only A Day\\", but failed to find favour with the voting juries, finishing in last place. Sue and Sunny joined forces again to sing backing vocals for Vikki Watson's UK entry \\"Love Is...\\" in Gothenburg at the 1985 Eurovision final. This song was placed fourth. The sisters also toured regularly with popular German orchestra leader, James Last, during much of the 1970s. They also were part of the Birds of Paris, a group of backing singers that worked mainly with disco producer Alec R. Costandinos and included Madeline Bell, Joanne Stone, Kay Garner, Vicki Brown and Katie Kissoon. Sue, Sunny and Bell contributed backing vocals for three albums by Donna Summer during the later part of the decade. In 1979, Sue Glover appeared in the debut TV play from Victoria Wood, Talent, playing the part of club singer 'Cathy Christmas'. On David Mitton and Robert D. Cardona's Tugs, Sue Glover sang the rendition of the show's theme song in the final episode \\"Bigg Freeze\\". In an interview from Sodor Island Fansite (SiF), a Thomas the Tank Engine fan site, Mike O'Donnell, the composer, said that there were talks to providing the theme song on record. However, the show never took off because of TVS going bankrupt.

Life Nothing is known of his life prior to 1570, when he went to Venice, already 29 or 30 years old, to receive a musical education with the renowned organist and composer Claudio Merulo of the Venetian School. By 1573 he was in Mantua, where he composed hymns which were used in the church of Santa Barbara, which was the ducal chapel of the Gonzaga family. He served that aristocratic family until 1582, when he went to Graz to work for Archduke Charles II of Austria both as court organist and music tutor to the Archduke's children. When the Archduke died in 1590 he returned to Mantua and resumed his former service of the Gonzaga family, specifically as organist at the chapel. While in Mantua, and under the patronage of the artistically-inclined Gonzaga family, he was part of an illustrious group of composers that included some of the most famous in Italy, such as Alessandro Striggio, Giaches de Wert, Benedetto Pallavicino, Francesco Soriano, Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi, and of course Claudio Monteverdi.Tagmann/Fink, Grove onlineGallico, Grove online Monteverdi mentioned Rovigo him favorably in his letters, with none of the animosity reserved for Benedetto Pallavicino, another composer at the Mantuan court. Rovigo died at Mantua at the age of 56; he is buried in the crypt of the cathedral of Santa Barbara, near to the tomb of Giaches de Wert, who died the previous year. Music Rovigo wrote a large quantity of sacred music, as well as madrigals and some instrumental music. Much of his music, including some canzonette both for voices and instruments, and his early hymns, has been lost. His sacred music was mostly intended for liturgical use, and includes settings of the mass, for up to 12 voices, in the Venetian style; litanies, three settings of the Magnificat, for six voices; a setting of the St. Luke Passion; and other works. He published one book of madrigals for five voices in Venice in 1581, and many of them were sufficiently popular to be reprinted in some well-known anthologies. His instrumental pieces included canzonas, and many were published in Milan. Rovigo, along with Giaches de Wert, was one of the composers assigned the task of composing music for a performance of Guarini's Il pastor fido in 1591 or 1592. One of the singers of the court at Mantua, Evangelista Campagnolo, was to play the part of Silvio. The work was never performed: in 1596, the Gonzagas issued a separate commission for composition of the work, to Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi, and some of his choruses have survived in his madrigal books. It is not known if any of Rovigo's music for the earlier dramatic musical production has survived, or indeed if he ever wrote any. This production was not an opera, though it would have had some characteristics in common with one; the earliest opera, Dafne, was still several years away.Einstein, Vol. II p. 602-603 References * Pierre M.

The mill is protected as Watkins Woolen Mill State Historic Site, which preserve its machinery and business records in addition to the building itself. It was designated a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 in recognition for its remarkable state of preservation. The historic site is the centerpiece of Watkins Mill State Park, which is managed by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. History Waltus L. Watkins established the 80-acre livestock farm he called Bethany Plantation in 1839. Watkins Mill was built in 1859-1860. Watkins built housing for the mill workers nearby, creating one of the first planned communities in North America. The community was effectively self-sufficient, the mill producing yarn and wool cloth. The mill operated at capacity until 1886, two years after Watkins' death. From 1886 to the turn of the twentieth century production declined. Nearly all of the mill machinery has been preserved, including a 65-horsepower steam engine that powered the factory. The site also includes the Watkins house, dating to 1850. The twelve- room, 2¬Ω-story house includes three staircases, the main stair detailed in carved walnut. It remained a Watkins family home until 1945. The Franklin School, or Octagonal School, is an octagonal schoolhouse built in 1856 and used by the Watkins family and their employees until the mid-1870s, when it became a residence for mill workers. The unusual octagonal building was built of locally manufactured brick on Watkins land. The Watkins family also donated the land for Mt. Vernon Baptist Church, built in 1871 to replace a log church dating to the 1850s. Of the $5000 construction cost, more than half was donated by Watkins. After going through several changes in ownership, the state of Missouri took possession of the property, creating a state park in 1964. It was named a National Mechanical Engineering Historic Landmark in 1980.  State park  The recreation area of the state park has 96 campsites, most of which have electric hookups, and many of which are available year- round. A lake supports fishing for bass, catfish, crappie and sunfish and has a large sand swimming beach. A asphalt bicycling and walking trail follows the shoreline of the lake, and there is a separate equestrian trail.

Geography The city is included in the geographic area covered by the Brazilian semiarid, defined by the Ministry of National Integration in 2005. This distinction is made based precipitation index, the index of aridity and drought risk. Monuments and Historic Buildings There are many monuments and historic buildings in the city, like the house of culture, which was the old jail, where torture was no different to blacks and people who disobeyed the law. In the city center can find the Church of Our Lady of Good Success and Our Lady of the Rosary, and there are others just symbolic, as Centenary Square, the Pillar of Time, Cruise, and the Bandstand, where today downstairs is a bar known as \\"The Centenary Bar\\", and upstairs is a small club called AEUP (Association of University Students of Pombal). There are other parks, churches and monuments in the city, but these are the ones that attract wide attention. University in Pombal Since 2006, the population of Pombal protested the establishment of colleges or universities in the city. Since early 2007 the Federal University of Campina Grande UFCG is acting in the city, was first headquartered in the building of the former School Joshua BEZERRRA. And with the campus opening planned for 2010, CAIC nearby school in the district Pear. Facilities include 18 buildings and a vast land area. According to data, the second largest campus of a university in the state of Paraiba. But with the work already underway by a vast time, In July 2009, during Pombal Fest was the inauguration of the campus, he expected the presence of President Lula, but the same could not attend. Radios In the city there are four radio stations, the programming is varied radios Liberdade96fm, Maring√°98.7fm, Op√ß√£o104fm and religious radio programming is Bomsucessoam. In addition to songs from all rhythms, the radios serve as news to major news of the city where the company participates in phone calls making public complaints about abuse, politics, vandalism, corruption and crime. The radios provide full coverage of the city to city events such as Pombal Fest, Feast of the Rosary, plus exclusive interviews with established singers who make presentations in the city in times of festivity. Among the city's radio announcers stand Goddess Fernandes, Nil Alcantara Claudionou Naldo Silva Dantas and the interactivity with the people in their programs.

It most notably details how to find the surface area of a sphere and the volume of the contained ball and the analogous values for a cylinder, and was the first to do so. Retrieved on 2008-06-22 Contents The volume of a sphere to the volume of cylinder is 2 to 3 The principal formulae derived in On the Sphere and Cylinder are those mentioned above: the surface area of the sphere, the volume of the contained ball, and surface area and volume of the cylinder. Let r be the radius of the sphere and cylinder, and h be the height of the cylinder, with the assumption that the cylinder is a right cylinder -- the side is perpendicular to both caps. In his work, Archimedes showed that the surface area of a cylinder is equal to: :A_C = 2 \\\\pi r^2 + 2 \\\\pi r h = 2 \\\\pi r ( r + h ).\\\\, and that the volume of the same is: :V_C = \\\\pi r^2 h. \\\\, On the sphere, he showed that the surface area is four times the area of its great circle. In modern terms, this means that the surface area is equal to: :A_S = 4\\\\pi r^2.\\\\, The result for the volume of the contained ball stated that it is two-thirds the volume of a circumscribed cylinder, meaning that the volume is :V_S = \\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi r^3. When the inscribing cylinder is tight and has a height h = 2r, so that the sphere touches the cylinder at the top and botton, he showed that both the volume and the surface area of the sphere were two- thirds that of the cylinder. This implies the area of the sphere is equal to the area of the cylinder minus its caps. This result would eventually lead to the Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection, a way of mapping the world that accurately represents areas. Archimedes was particularly proud of this latter result, and so he asked for a sketch of a sphere inscribed in a cylinder to be inscribed on his grave. Later, Roman philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero discovered the tomb, which had been overgrown by surrounding vegetation. The argument Archimedes used to prove the formula for the volume of a ball was rather involved in its geometry, and many modern textbooks have a simplified version using the concept of a limit, which did not exist in Archimedes' time. Archimedes used an inscribed half-polygon in a semicircle, then rotated both to create a conglomerate of frustums in a sphere, of which he then determined the volume. It seems that this is not the original method Archimedes used to derive this result, but the best formal argument available to him in the Greek mathematical tradition. His original method likely involved a clever use of levers. A palimpsest stolen from the Greek Orthodox Church in the early 20th century, which reappeared at auction in 1998, contained many of Archimedes works, including The Method of Mechanical Theorems, in which he describes a method to determine volumes which involves balances, centers of mass and infinitesimal slices.

The case was consolidated with thirteen other antitrust suits against Intel by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in November 2005. In July 2007, U.S. District Judge Joseph James Farnan Jr. largely denied Intel's motion to dismiss. The court date, originally scheduled for April 2009, was pushed back to February 2010. In February 2009 it was reported that Intel had spent at least $116 million to date on legal representation on the antitrust suit.

Investigation of the site has uncovered evidence of human habition as far back as 8,000 years. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964; it has been recommended for de-designation due to looting. Description The cave is located in an outcrop of sandstone approximately north of Portland, overlooking the Missouri River.Shippee, J.M. \\"The Archaeology of Arnold-Research Cave Callaway County, Missouri\\". Missouri Archaeologist 28 (1966). The cave is substantially more than a rock shelter, with interior chambers accessible by low passages. When white settlers moved to the area in the early 19th century, one of them, John Phillips, began mining saltpetre from the cave for the manufacture of gunpowder. A later long-term owner was H.A. Arnold, giving the cave the name by which it is most commonly known. It has been the subject of archaeological interest since the mid-1950s, with intermixed materials that date back an estimate seven to ten thousand years. Finds at the cave are particularly notable for fine examples of footwear. The cave has produced several of North America's oldest human clothing finds including a pair of leather wrapped moccasins dating back 5,500 years ago. The site has been repeatedly disturbed, both by burrowing animals, and previously laid layers of cultural materials have been disturbed by subsequent occupants of the cave. By the early 1980s alterations to deposits at the cave mouth by the property owner had compromised some of the materials.

Biography  Eduardo Mar√≠a Zamacois y Zabala was born in Bilbao, Spain; the son of Professor Miguel Antonio de Zamacois y Berreteaga (1794-1863), and his second wife, Ruperta Mar√≠a del Pilar de Zabala y Arauco. His father was the founder and director of the Santiago de Vizcaya School of Humanities.Brief biography @ the Carmen Thyssen Museum. His relatives included numerous artists: writers, actors and musicians. Of Basque ancestry, their surname originated in Hasparren, France, where it was originally spelled \\"Samacoys\\". The Inopportune Visit He received a thorough education, which included drawing classes with a local artist named Joaqu√≠n Balaca (c.1820-?). Later, when his father's school closed, the family moved to Madrid and, in 1856, he was enrolled at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he studied with Federico de Madrazo.Brief biography @ the Museo del Prado. In 1860, on Madrazo's recommendation, he went to Paris and attended the classes of Charles Gleyre in preparation for applying to the √àcole des Beaux-Arts. His application there was denied, so he turned to the workshops of Ernest Meissonier, where he found a position. The French Occupation A skillful business negotiator, he strove to gain access to as many European exhibitions as possible. Success came quickly. In 1861, he was commissioned to create decorative paintings in the quarters of the future king, Alfonso XII at the Palacio Real de Madrid. This work won him a grant from the , which enabled him to continue his studies. In 1862 and 1864, he was awarded medals at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts. He was married in Paris in 1865, to Louise Marie H√©loise Perrin, whom he had met at the home of his friend, Jehan Georges Vibert. They had two children: Miguel Louis Pascual, who became a well-known journalist and playwright, and a posthumous daughter, Marie H√©l√®ne, (who married the painter, Jean Alfred Marioton). In 1866, he became good friends with the painter, Mari√† Fortuny, who did a portrait etching of him. During a trip to Rome, Zamacois also posed as a toreador for Fortuny's painting, The Spanish Wedding. Later, he contacted his friend, Adolphe Goupil, and put him in touch with Fortuny, which resulted in an exclusive contract with Goupil & Cie; a turning point in Fortuny's career. In 1870, he was awarded the Gold Medal at the Salon for his painting, The Education of a Prince. After a showing in London, one of his paintings was purchased by Charles Dickens. The Franco-Prussian War created difficulties that eventually forced him to return to Madrid. His arrival there coincided with the official coronation of King Amadeus I, and he attended the ceremonies. It was an unusually cold winter and he became ill the following day. He died there suddenly, aged 29, of what was described as \\"gangrenous angina\\" (possibly Diphtheria). In 1878, he was awarded a posthumous diploma by the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and a major retrospective at the Exposition Universelle.

It is located in the 356 acre Graham Cave State Park. The entrance of the sandstone cave forms a broad arch wide and high. Extending about into the hillside, the cave protects an historically important Pre-Columbian archaeological site from the ancient Dalton and Archaic period dating back to as early as 10,000 years ago. Graham Cave was formed at the point of contact of Jefferson City dolomite and St. Peter sandstone. Due to water flowing and freezing, the cave grew over the years. The cave originally extended about 100 feet into the hill, but an accumulation of debris over the years filled the lower part of the cave with about seven feet of deposits. With a broad entrance, the cave provided sufficient shelter to humans and animals alike. Robert Graham, who originally settled in the area in 1816 when he purchased some bottomland from a son of Daniel Boone, purchased the property including the cave in 1847. Graham's son D.F. Graham sheltered hogs in the cave and became interested in archeology from the artifacts he found there. After his death, his collection of artifacts was offered by his son Benjamin to the University of Missouri, which investigated the cave in 1930. Benjamin's son-in-law was persuaded to delay plans to enlarge the shelter for his livestock in 1948 so that archeological excavations could be made. Excavations revealed this circle of stones around a larger stone at or below the 8800-year stratum. The University of Missouri and the Missouri Archaeological Society excavated the cave between 1949 and 1961. These excavations revealed clues that linked the site to the lifestyle of the Dalton and Archaic Native Americans. The importance of the findings in that period resulted in the site being the first archaeological site in the United States to be designated a National Historical Landmark. Reports were published by the Missouri Archaeological Society. The first report was published by W. D. Logan in 1952 and a second report was published by Walter Klippel in 1971. The site is discussed by Professor Carl Chapman in The Archaeology of Missouri, volume 1 (1975), and by Professors O'Brien and Wood in The Prehistory of Missouri (1998). The cave is now part of a state park operated by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. Visitors are allowed up to the entrance of the cave where interpretive signs point out important archaeological discoveries.

Schuster, and starring Don Ameche and Joan Bennett. It is also known as Between You and Me and Man from Brazil. Plot June Delaney belongs to the upper circles of New York City's social life. When she learns that her private money has been impounded by the British government, since most of her investments are made by her father in England before the outbreak of World War II, she is very annoyed. To make the most of what she got and continue living as before she is forced to rent out her upscale apartment. She advertises in a newspaper, and gets a response from a prospective tenant, a Venezuelan playboy and sole heir to an American rubber industry, Pedro Sullivan. Pedro is going to the United States to secure a bank loan for his father's business, and needs a place to stay during the negotiations. Despite the huge cost of renting the fancy apartment, he cannot resist its beauty and the charms of its owner June. When Pedro arrives to his new temporary home, June is dressed in an apron, and Pedro mistakes her for a servant. June does not take him out of his misconception, but continues to play along, telling him that Miss Delaney is away traveling. Since June knows nothing of the servant role, Pedro is soon very disappointed with her services. Pedro also meets resistance in the negotiations with the largest tire manufacturer in the United States, Ambrose Murdock Flint, who insists on investing his money in a rubber substitute instead of the real rubber Pedro has to offer. When Pedro talks to the company's New York representative, Mr. Cordoba, the latter misunderstands him and thinks he has been granted the loan by Flint. June and Pedro go to the same club that night, and June tries to evade Pedro when she discovers him. Her real name is disclosed to Pedro though by an employee, and since June is oblivious of this, she lets Pedro take her to another club, where they start to fall in love with each other. Mr. Cordoba learns that Pedro never got the loan and chastises him relentlessly. Pedro is ordered back to Venezuela. By one of June's jealous friends, he is led to believe that it was June that told Cordoba about the loan, to sabotage the deal. June on the other hand, is trying to use her charms to convince Flint investing in property she can offer him, to help Pedro get the money. A misunderstanding occurs as Pedro believes June is competing with him for Flint's money. June and Pedro become enemies, but make up at one of June's friends charity events. At the event, June manages to make Pedro and Flint meet again, and with June's help they finally reach an agreement and Pedro gets the loan. June and Pedro become a romantic couple, but Pedro accidentally manages to flatten Flint's car tire with a gun.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/76396/Girl-Trouble/ Cast *Don Ameche as Don Pedro Sullivan *Joan Bennett as June Delaney *Billie Burke as Mrs. Rowland *Frank Craven as Ambrose Murdock Flint *Alan Dinehart as Charles Barrett *Helene Reynolds as Helen Martin *Fortunio Bonanova as Simon Cordoba *Ted North as George *Doris Merrick as Susan *Dale Evans as Ruth *Roseanne Murray as Pauline *Janis Carter as Virginia *Vivian Blaine as Barbara *Trudy Marshall as Miss Kennedy *Robert Greig as Fields *Joseph Crehan as Kohn *Mantan Moreland as Edwards *Arthur Loft as Burgess * John Kelly as Mug *Matt McHugh as Driver *George Lessey as Morgan *Edith Evanson as Huida *Eddie Acuff as Taxi Driver *Lee Bennett as Tom *Ruth Cherrington as Large Woman *Frank Coghlan, Jr. as Elevator Boy *Jeff Corey as Mr. Mooney *Mary Currier as Secretary *Arno Frey as Anton *Marjorie Kane as Cashier *Lois Landon as Mrs. Lawson *Forbes Murray as Mr. Lawson *Henry Roquemore as Man *Edwin Stanley as Lehman *Jack Stoney as Mac *Bruce Warren as Jerry *Doodles Weaver as Ticket Taker External links *Girl Trouble at the TCM Movie Database * * References Category:1942 films Category:1942 comedy films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Harold D.

Bates was born on a farm in what is today Darien, Connecticut, the son of John Bates and Sarah Bostwick. During the American War of Independence, he was captured by local rebel sympathizers, who pressured him to reveal locations of British Loyalists, including his brother. After escaping, Bates fled Connecticut and ended up in British-occupied New York City. He later became a farmer and teacher on Long Island, another Loyalist stronghold. Walter Bates was a founder of Trinity Church in Kingston, New Brunswick With the end of the war, it became untenable for the Loyalists to remain in New York. In 1783, Bates accepted a British offer of of land in New Brunswick, plus two years' supplies and transportation to his new homestead at Kingston, New Brunswick. He was part of the first contingent of Loyalist settlers who sailed in that year on the \\"Spring Fleet\\", departing from Huntington Bay, New York on April 11 and arriving in Nova Scotia on April 16, 1783. Once in Kingston, Bates became a selectman and then served several terms as the high sheriff of Kings County, New Brunswick. He was also a founder of the Anglican Trinity Church in Kingston, completed in 1789. In October 1884, Bates married Abigail Lyon; the couple had four children. In 1817, Bates wrote The Mysterious Stranger; or, memoirs of Henry More Smith; alias Henry Frederick Moon; alias William Newman: who is now confined in Simbury mines, in Connecticut, for the crime of burglary; containing an account of his . . . confinement in the gaol of King's County, province of New Brunswick . . . with a statement of his succeeding conduct. The book was about a burglar and confidence man named Henry More Smith, whom Bates got to know Smith while he was incarcerated in Kingston. The Mysterious Stranger chronicled Smith's jail breaks and comical behavior over a two-year period. However, it also described the local region and the people who had settled it. Published in the United States and the United Kingdom, The Mysterious Stranger sold thousands of copies. In 1840, Bates had plans to publish a second book about the founding of Kingston and the journey from New York, going so far as to publish a prospectus for potential subscribers. He never completed the book and he died in Kingston on February 11, 1842. A portion of the work was eventually published in 1889 as Kingston and the loyalists of the \\"spring fleet\\" of 1783, by the historian W.O. Raymond.

George Allison Whiteman (born October 12, 1919 in Pettis County, Missouri, died December 7, 1941 at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii) was an American military aviator, and was one of the 2,403 victims killed during the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by Imperial Japanese Navy forces. Whiteman Air Force Base is named for him.  Biography  Whiteman, the eldest of 10 children of John and Earlie Whiteman, was born at the Wilkerson farm near Longwood. He graduated from Smith-Cotton High School in Sedalia and attended the Rolla School of Mines (later University of Missouri-Rolla and now Missouri S&T;) before enlisting in the service in 1939. In the spring of 1940, Whiteman received orders to report to Randolph Field, Texas, for training as an aviator. On November 15, 1940, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Air Corps (later Army Air Forces) and volunteered for duty in Hawaii early the following year. As the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor began, Lt. Whiteman went to his P-40B Warhawk aircraft at Bellows Field and had just lifted off the runway when a burst of Japanese gunfire hit his cockpit, wounding him and throwing the plane out of control. The plane crashed and burned just off the end of the runway. Whiteman died from his injuries. The news of his death reached his family at 10:13 p.m. the same day. In an interview with the Sedalia Democrat that night, his mother said: \\"It's hard to believe. It might have happened anytime, anywhere. We've got to sacrifice loved ones if we want to win this war.\\" She gave the reporter a photograph of her son sitting in an aircraft with the inscription \\"Lucky, lucky me.\\" Whiteman was one of the first airmen killed during the assault which marked the United States entry into World War II, and is considered the first American pilot killed in aerial combat in World War II while serving under American forces. For his gallantry that day, Lieutenant Whiteman was posthumously awarded the Silver Star, the Purple Heart, the American Defense Medal with a Foreign Service clasp, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic- Pacific Campaign Medal with one bronze star, and the World War II Victory Medal. On August 24, 1955, 14 years after Whiteman's death, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Nathan F. Twining informed Whiteman's mother that the recently reopened Sedalia Air Force Base would be renamed Whiteman Air Force Base in tribute to her son.

Before professional baseball Prior to being drafted, Moeller attended Cleveland High School in Reseda, California. He then went on to attend Los Angeles Valley College, and was drafted from there in the 17th round of the 1986 amateur draft. Professional baseball Moeller began his professional career in 1986 with the Eugene Emeralds. Used almost entirely as a starter (14 appearances, 11 starts), he went 4-0 with a 3.06 ERA, striking out 65 batters in 61 innings of work.

Pitching for the Omaha Royals in 1992, Moeller went 8-5 with a 2.46 ERA in 120 innings of work. His solid performance earned him a promotion to the big league club, and on July 28 he made his major league debut against the Toronto Blue Jays. Moeller started the game, going 4 innings, allowing four hits, two hits and four runs (although one of them was unearned). Two of the hits he gave up were back-to-back home runs by Kelly Gruber and Candy Maldonado to start off the top of the second inning. The Blue Jays won the game 6-4. Moeller made a total of five appearances in the majors in 1992, starting four of the games and going 0-3 with a 7.00 ERA. In 18 innings of work, he allowed 24 hits, 14 earned runs, 11 walks and he struck out only six batters. On November 19, 1992, he was traded to the Pirates with Joel Johnston for Jos√© Lind. He made 10 appearances in the big leagues in 1993, going 1-0 with a 9.92 ERA. Despite having a perfect record, he spent the majority of his time in the minors, where he made 24 appearances for the Buffalo Bisons (11 starts). With them, he went 3-4 with a 4.34 ERA. He was granted free agency on October 15, and was signed by the Royals on November 28.

He is considered to be the first Japanese person to fly. He is also known as Ch≈çjin K≈çkichi (/K≈çkichi the birdman), Hy≈çgu-shi K≈çkichi (/K≈çkichi the Paperhanger), Sakuraya K≈çkichi (), Bizen'ya K≈çkichi (), and Bink≈çsai (). Biography Ukita was born in 1757 during the Edo period in Hachihama, Kojima District, Bizen Province (now Hachihama, Tamano, Okayama) as the second son of Ukita (Sakuraya) Seibei (). His father became sick when Ukita was seven years old. After his father's death he went to Okayama and became an apprentice of Hy≈çgu-shi, paperhanger (maker of Sh≈çji, Fusuma). Ukita was interested in how birds fly, so he decided to pursue research in the area. From his research, he concluded that \\"Computing the ratio of the wing's surface area to the body's weight and using that ratio to create an artificial wing for a human, then a human, too, will be able to fly like a bird.\\" His skill of paperhanging was very useful for making wings. He made the wings' delicate ribs from bamboo, covered them with paper and fabric, and varnished the surface with lacquer from Japanese persimmons. After discarding many prototypes, Ukita tried flying from a bridge over Asahigawa-river (Êó≠Â∑ù) in the summer of 1785.http://www.japanese-greatest.com/technology/flight.html Some references say that he glided several meters, but others say that he just fell.

Not much is known about his later years, but there are two opinions. One is that Ukita flew again at Sunpu and was executed for a crime of rioting. Another is that Ukita moved to Mitsuke (), T≈çt≈çmi Province(now Iwata, Shizuoka), where he quietly spent the rest of his life with wife and children and died peacefully in 1847 at age 92.

Theatrical s√©ances are usually performed in either total or partial darkness to replicate the atmosphere of a traditional seance, to set the mood for the performance, and to hide the methods of the performer. Performance-goers may be treated to a variety of mentalism demonstrations during a theatrical s√©ance, including examples of clairvoyance, ESP, precognition and telekinesis, in addition to or in preparation of apparent mediumship.  Popular examples of theatrical s√©ances  Theatrical s√©ances are very popular at Halloween and are often offered for fright value. Private magic cabarets may offer this type of performance, including: The Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brooks Psychic Theater in Scranton Poconos offers theatrical s√©ances year round. Its production of \\"Haunted! Mysteries of THE Beyond!\\" is one of the longest running performances of its type having started in 2003. The Fall 2008 issue of the Pennsylvania Pursuits Magazine put out by the Pennsylvania Tourism Office of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania picked the location of Psychic Theater at 1433 N. Main Avenue in Scranton, Pennsylvania as one of the 10 most haunted places in Pennsylvania, placing it at number 9. The Houdini Museum offers yearly Houdini s√©ances geared specifically toward \\"contacting Houdini.\\" The original Houdini s√©ances were done by Houdini's wife Beatrice (Bess) for ten years after Houdini died. She found doing the Houdini s√©ance each year very stressful, possibly hoping against hope that if anyone could escape from the other side and return in a s√©ance, it would be Houdini. At the end of ten years she passed the honor, legacy and tradition of doing the Houdini seances to friend, confidant and Houdini ghost writer Walter B. Gibson. She announced \\"ten years is long enough to wait for any man!\\" Gibson was also writer of The Shadow series that became a series of pulp novels, comic books, a radio show, a TV show and a movie that starred Alec Baldwin. From the 1970s on Gibson would attend the Houdini seances at New York's Magic Towne House, run by Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz. Before Walter died, he passed on the tradition to Dietrich, who continues to do the Houdini S√©ance each year. A Houdini seance has been presented by Neil Tobin, Necromancer at the Excalibur nightclub annually since October 2001. This event is presented on behalf of the Chicago Assembly of the Society of American Magicians during the last week of October to commemorate the late magician's death; Houdini helped found the Chicago Assembly in 1919.Houdini's Halloween from WGN-TV and Red Eye, October 28, 2005 A short theatrical seance also concludes Supernatural Chicago, a popular interactive theater show by Neil Tobin. It is currently in its seventh straight year of performances.Haunting Tales Fill Late-Night Haunt from the Chicago Tribune, October 27, 2005. Los Angeles' Magic Castle has a separate room dedicated to theatrical s√©ances. Their evening s√©ance program entitled, \\"Demons\\" is a recreation of a Victorian-era s√©ance replete with mediumistic staples such as table-rapping, slate (writing), spirit photography, eerie inexplicable sounds and many other \\"psychic\\" experiments. Another popular theatrical s√©ance, this one touring theatrical stages and smaller venues, entitled Phantoms, was presented by mentalist Gregory Bishop (Edmonds). Phantoms employed items associated with, and actually belonging to, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini. First presented in 1995, it was designed for presentation in two versions: the larger, and more family-friendly stage version, and the smaller (somewhat \\"scarier\\" version), presented in private homes and in club settings. The larger, stage version of the show included the spirit cabinet illusion, along with a spirit trumpet, floating table and various other mainstays of the Victorian s√©ance scene.  Ethics and legality Theatrical s√©ances are not intended to be \\"real\\" s√©ances and should only be seen as entertainment; hence the adjective, theatrical. According to Houdini, if the s√©ance leader is honest and admits his trickery, he is a theatrical performer; if not, he is a charlatan and a fraud.Houdini in The New York Times, Hints of Seances at White House Ethically, a paying audience should be notified beforehand that they will be experiencing a work of interactive theater rather than an actual Spiritualist seance. Once the audience is inside the performance space, however, the performer's primary responsibility is to create a convincingly realistic theatrical experience, just as in other forms of theater. Additionally, the ambiguity of whether every manifestation is the result of deception or not may be part of the enjoyment that a theatrical seance provides.

Reign length  Detail of a relief showing Sneferu wearing the white robe of the Sed-festival, from his funerary temple of Dahshur and now on display at the Egyptian Museum The 24-year Turin Canon figure for Sneferu's reign is considered today to be an underestimate since this king's highest-known date is an inscription discovered at the Red Pyramid of Dahshur and mentioning Sneferu's 24th cattle count, corresponding to at least 24 full years.Miroslav Verner, Archaeological Remarks on the 4th and 5th Dynasty Chronology\\", Archiv Orient√°ln√≠. vol. 69, Praha 2001, page 367 Sneferu, however, was known to have a minimum of at least three years after the cattle count dates: his years after the 10th, the 13th and the 18th count are attested at his Meidum pyramid.Verner, pp.367 This would mean that Sneferu ruled Egypt a minimum of 27 full years. However, in the Palermo Stone, recto 6 at the bottom of the fragment shows the year of the 7th count of Sneferu while recto 7 on the same following row shows the year of the 8th count of Sneferu.H. Sch√§fer, Ein Bruchst√ºck alt√§gyptischer Annalen, 1902 (APAW: Phil.-hist Kl. 4) 30-31 Significantly, there is a previous mostly intact column for Sneferu in recto 5 which also mentions events in this king's reign in a specific year but does not mention the previous (6th) year.see Christine Hobson, Exploring the World of the Pharaohs:A Complete Guide to Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson paperback, 1993, p.15 This column must, therefore, be dated to the year after the 6th count of Sneferu. Hence, Sneferu's reign would be a minimum of 28 years. Since there are many periods in Sneferu's reigns for which Egyptologists have few dates‚Äîonly the years of the 2nd, 7th, 8th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 23rd and 24th count are known for Sneferu before one considers the years after his cattle countsVerner, pp.365-367‚Äîthis pharaoh is most likely to have had a reign in excess of 30 years to manage to build three pyramids in his long rule but not 48 years since the cattle count was not regularly biannual during his kingship. (There are fewer years after the count dates known for Sneferu compared to year of the count or census dates.)  Family and succession  Cartouche name Sneferu in the Abydos King List Sneferu was the first king of the Fourth Dynasty of ancient Egypt, who according to Manetho reigned for 24 years (2613‚Äì2589 BC). Manetho was an Egyptian priest, living in the third century BC, who categorized the pharaohs of dynastic Egypt into thirty-one dynasties.An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, pg. 36 His schematic has its flaws; nevertheless, modern scholars conventionally follow his method of grouping. The Papyrus Prisse, a Middle Kingdom source, supports the fact that King Huni was indeed Sneferu's predecessor. It states that \\"the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Huni, came to the landing place (i.e., died), and the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Sneferu, was raised up as a beneficent king in this entire land...\\"\\"The Instructions of Kagemni,\\" Papyrus Prisse Aside from Sneferu's succession, we learn from this text that later generations considered him to be a \\"beneficent\\" ruler. This idea may stem from the etymology of the king's name, for it can be interpreted as the infinitive \\"to make beautiful\\".The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, pg. 93 It is uncertain whether Huni was Sneferu's father; however, the Cairo Annals Stone denotes that his mother may have been a woman named Meresankh.The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, pg. 51 Hetepheres I was Sneferu's main wife and the mother of Khufu,The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, pg. 57 the builder of the Great Pyramid on the Giza Plateau. = Children = Sons of Sneferu: * Khufu ‚Äì son of Sneferu and Hetepheres I, successor to Sneferu. * Ankhhaf ‚Äì King's Son of his Body, King's vizier (under his nephew Khafre).

Building projects  The Meidum pyramid Sneferu Pyramid waste limestone block. Hole in bottom, used as pivot block on which to turn heavy levers in moving stones. 4th Dynasty. From Meidum, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London The most well known monuments from Sneferu's reign are the three pyramids he is considered to have built in Dahshur: the Bent Pyramid, the Red Pyramid and the Meidum pyramid. Under Sneferu, there was a major evolution in monumental pyramid structures, which would lead to Khufu's Great Pyramid, which would be seen as the pinnacle of the Egyptian Old Kingdom's majesty and splendour, and as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The first of Sneferu's massive undertakings is the Pyramid at Meidum. There is some debate among scholars as to Sneferu's claim to the Meidum pyramid, and many credit its origin to King Huni. Nonetheless, the pyramid is a remarkable example of the progression of technology and ideology surrounding the king's burial site. The immense stone structure serves as physical testimony to the transition from the stepped pyramid structure to that of a \\"true\\" pyramid structure. Archaeological investigations of the pyramid show that it was first conceived as a seven-stepped structure, built in a similar manner to the Djoser complex at Saqqara. Modifications later were made to add another platform, and at an even later stage limestone facing was added to create the smooth, angled finish characteristic of a \\"true\\" pyramid.An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, pg.134 Complete with a descending northern passage, two underground chambers, and a burial vault, the pyramid mainly follows the conventions of previous tombs in most aspects other than one: instead of being situated underneath the colossal structure, the burial chamber is built directly within the main body albeit very near ground level.The Egyptian Pyramids... pg. 51 Sneferu's Bent Pyramid at Dahshur The Bent Pyramid, also known as the Rhomboidal or Blunted Pyramid, attests to an even greater increase in architectural innovations. As the name suggests, the angle of the inclination changes from 55¬∞ to about 43¬∞ in the upper levels of the pyramid. It is likely that the pyramid initially was not designed to be built this way, but was modified during construction due to unstable accretion layers. As a means of stabilising the structure, the top layers were laid horizontally, marking the abandonment of the step pyramid concept.An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, pg.135 The internal components of the Rhomboidal pyramid have also evolved. There are two entrances, one from the north and another from the west. The subterranean chambers are much larger, and distinguished by corbel walls and ceilings with more complex diagonal portcullis systems in place. J.P Lepre asserts: The satellite pyramid complementing Sneferu's Bent Pyramid introduces more change in the architecture of the time, when the passageway is built ascending westward (as opposed to the conventionally descending northward direction of the passages of previously build pyramids) towards the burial chambers.The Egyptian Pyramids... pg. 53-54 Egypt decided to open the Bent Pyramid for tourism in July 2019 for the first time since 1965. Tourists will be able to reach two 4600-year-old chambers through a 79-meter narrow tunnel built from the northern entrance of the pyramid. 18-meter-high \\"side pyramid\\", which is assumed that have been built for Sneferu's wife Hetepheres will also be accessible. It is the first time for this adjacent pyramid opened to the public after its excavation in 1956. The Red Pyramid of Sneferu With the increase of innovation in Sneferu's building projects, one expects that his last pyramid, the Red Pyramid, will show the greatest complexity and change in architecture yet. Upon first glance, one may be disappointed seeing that the construction of the Red Pyramid seemingly is simpler than its predecessor. Lepre points out that some of the internal innovations that the previous pyramids boast seem to be missing in the king's last monument. Although the chambers and burial vaults are all present in the monument's main body, no ascending passageway has been excavated, nor is there evidence of a western entrance or diagonal portcullis. Although the absence of these features have dissuaded many archaeologists from further studying the Red Pyramid, Lepre is convinced that there are secret chambers waiting to be uncovered within the stone superstructure. Considering that the remains of King Sneferu have not yet been found, it still may be possible that his sarcophagus and mummy lie hidden in his mysterious last structure. Lepre claims: \\"the Red pyramid remains one of the chief pyramids that may possibly contain secret chambers, not the least of which may be the true burial chamber of King Sneferu himself.\\"The Egyptian Pyramids... pg. 54 Whether or not this conjecture is true is left to modern archaeologists to determine. Sneferu's architectural innovations served as a catalyst for later pyramid builders to build on. The first king of the fourth dynasty set a challenging precedent for his successors to match, and only Khufu's Great Pyramid can rival Sneferu's accomplishments. As time progressed and ideology changed in Ancient Egypt, the monuments of the kings decreased greatly in size. As the Pyramid of Menkaure is only a fraction of the size of the previous pyramids, the focus of Egyptian ideology might have shifted from the worship of the king to the direct worship of the sun god, Ra.An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt, pg. 144  Foreign relations  To enable Sneferu to undertake such massive building projects, he would have had to secure an extensive store of labour and materials. According to Guillemette Andreu, this is where the king's foreign policy played a large part. Sneferu's conquests into Libya and Nubia served two purposes: the first goal was to establish an extensive labour force, and the second goal was to gain access to the raw materials and special products that were available in these countries. This is alluded to in the Palermo Stone: :::\\"[Reign of] Sneferu. Year ... :::The building of Tuataua ships of mer wood :::of a hundred capacity, and 60 royal boats of sixteen capacity. :::Raid in the Land of the Blacks, and the bringing in of seven thousand :::prisoners, men and women, and twenty thousand cattle, sheep, and :::goats... :::The bringing of forty ships of cedar wood (or perhaps \\"laden with cedar :::wood\\")...\\" The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians, Pg. 100 (emphasis added) Reused building materials found at the pyramid complex of Amenemhat I that are thought originally to have been a depiction of the Sed festival for Sneferu According to this inscription, Sneferu was able to capture large numbers of people from other nations, make them his prisoners and then add them into his labour force. During his raids into Nubia and Libya, he also captured cattle for the sustenance of his massive labour force. Such incursions must have been incredibly devastating to the populations of the raided countries, and it is suggested that the campaigns into Nubia may have contributed to the dissemination of the A-Group culture of that region. Sneferu's military efforts in ancient Libya led to the capture of 11,000 prisoners and 13,100 head of cattle.Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, Pg. 107 Aside from the extensive import of cedar (most likely from Lebanon) described above, there is evidence of activity in the turquoise mines on the Sinai Peninsula.The Complete Royal Families, Pg. 50 There would also have been large-scale quarrying projects to provide Sneferu with the stone he needed for his pyramids. Sneferu's ancient cedar wood ship Praise of the Two Lands is the first known instance of a ship being referred to by name.Anzovin, item # 5393, page 385 \\"Reference to a ship with a name appears in an inscription of 2613 BCE that recounts the shipbuilding achievements of the fourth-dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Sneferu.

Many of her sketches and paintings were exhibited in the United States and Europe. Her sketches were often costume designs for characters of her mime performances or set designs for plays. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York holds selected works by Enters, as do other museums. Personal life Enters met journalist Louis Kantor in 1921. The two began dating secretly in 1924, wed quietly in Spain in 1936 but maintained separate households. In 1924, Enters changed her first name to Angna and began using 1907 as her birth year. Kantor also changed his name to Louis Kalonyme in 1924 and began writing art criticism for Arts and Decoration magazine. Kalonyme was friends with many notable thinkers of the day: Eugene O‚ÄôNeill, George Bernard Shaw, and Georgia O'Keeffe among them. The couple did not have any children and Kalonyme died in 1961 after a long illness. Writing Enters wrote three volumes of autobiography ‚Äì First Person Plural, (1937) Silly Girl (1944) and Artist's Life (1958). She also wrote a novel, Among the Daughters (1956), and a book on her work, On Mime (1966). Her plays, Love Possessed Juana: A Play of the Inquisition in Spain, co-written with Louis Kalonyme, and The Unknown Lover, were presented by the Houston Little Theater in 1946 and 1947.

The building is located at 614 Maxwell Avenue, Springer, NM 87747, and today it houses a museum devoted to the Santa Fe Trail. The building was placed on the National Register in 1987. Building The arrival of the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad and the subsequent abandonment of the Santa Fe Trail, caused the county seat of Colfax County to be moved from Cimarron to Springer in 1881. Local citizens were required to partially underwrite the construction of a new courthouse. The building was constructed in Second Empire Style, and is a typical New Mexico Territorial courthouse. The symmetrical, two-story building has a pitched roof, arched windows, and projecting three-story tower. The top floor of the tower held a noose which people got hanged in. The courtroom was on the second floor, with the judge's chambers in the rear. A single brick jail cell was later added at the back of the building. Colfax County War In 1885, the courthouse lawn was the site of one of the last gun battles of the Colfax County War, which was a series of skirmishes between squatters and the new owners of the Maxwell Land Grant. A group led by George Curry was assaulted by a group of sheriff's deputies on the courthouse lawn. Curry's brother and one of his followers were killed in the gun battle. Curry pleaded guilty to unlawfully caring firearms, and was fined five dollars. Curry went on to serve as governor of the New Mexico Territory from 1907 to 1910, and a US Representative from New Mexico from 1911 to 1913. New Location In 1897, as the result of a referendum and legislative action, the county seat was moved from Springer to Raton, forty miles to the north. The county clerk in Springer refused to release the county records until officials removed them by force. The loss of the county seat contributed to the decline of Springer. From 1910 to 1917, the courthouse was the first home of the New Mexico Reform School, which was later renamed the New Mexico Industrial School for Boys. After that, the courthouse was the site of the municipal offices and the Springer Public Library. In 1965, Springer residents voted to make the building into a museum devoted to the history of the Santa Fe Trail. The Santa Fe Trail Museum displays focus on the Santa Fe Trail, early pioneer life and art exhibits. Other exhibits include a shoe from Robert Wadlow,Robert Wadlow, World's Tallest Man, Alton, Illinois the \\"gentle giant.\\" The museum also contains the only electric chair used by the State Prison in Santa Fe until it was replaced by a gas chamber.

In the Book of Mormon, the vision was received in a dream by the prophet Lehi, and later in vision by his son Nephi, who wrote about it in the First Book of Nephi. The vision includes a path leading to a tree symbolizing salvation, with an iron rod along the path whereby followers of Jesus may hold to the rod and avoid wandering off the path into pits or waters symbolizing the ways of sin. The vision also includes a large building wherein the wicked look down at the righteous and mock them. The vision is said to symbolize the spiritual plight of humanity, and is a well known and cited story among members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). A Latter-day Saint commentator reflected a common belief of church members that the vision is \\"one of the richest, most flexible, and far-reaching pieces of symbolic prophecy contained in the standard works [scriptures].\\"Corbin T. Volluz, \\"Lehi's Dream of the Tree of Life: Springboard to Prophecy,\\" JBMS 2/2 (1993): 38. - as quoted in Lehi's Vision of the Tree of Life: Understanding the Dream as Visionary Literature, Charles Swift, Provo, Utah: Maxwell Institute, 2005. P. 52‚Äì63 - online version at The vision is similar to the second vision recounted by Smith's father Joseph Smith Sr. prior to publication of the Book of Mormon. The vision of Smith Sr. contained a tree with delicious fruit, a path, and a large building where the wicked looked down in scorn of the righteous; however, the vision of Smith Sr. contained a rope rather than an iron rod, and there were other minor differences.. Because of the similarity, secular church scholars postulate that Smith Sr.'s dream is the source for the tree of life vision.Fawn M. Brodie, No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1945), 58. Grant H. Palmer, An Insider's View of Mormon Origins (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002) 70-71. Dan Vogel, Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2004). Smith Sr.'s dream was first recorded by his wife Lucy Mack Smith after publication of the Book of Mormon, and some Latter- day Saint scholars suggest that the text of the Book of Mormon may have influenced Lucy's account, rather than vice versa. Other apologetic scholars, such as Hugh Nibley, postulate that Lehi and Smith Sr. simply had the same archetypal vision.Nibley, Hugh. Lehi in the Desert, The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Volume 5. Deseret Book Company, Salt Lake City, and F.A.R.M.S., Provo, Utah, 1988, p. 44. Synopsis A depiction of the vision in the Hill Cumorah Pageant According to the Book of Mormon, the prophet Lehi received this vision in a dream during his exile in the Arabian wilderness sometime after 600 B.C. He awoke and recounted it to his children as described in the 8th chapter of the First Book of Nephi. Lehi's son, Nephi, recorded the vision on the golden plates, and later had the same vision, albeit a more detailed version, which he records later in the same book.See 1 Nephi chapters 11‚Äì14 Nephi's vision also included an interpretation of the vision. In the vision, Lehi related that he saw several objects, including the following: #A tree with white fruit,1 Nephi 8:10-12 symbolizing the love of God, and by extension, the atonement of Jesus.1 Nephi 11:21-23 #A strait and narrow path,1 Nephi 8:20 symbolizing the path to salvation. #A rod of iron, which runs along the path,1 Nephi 8:19 symbolizing the \\"word of God\\".1 Nephi 11:25 Holding onto the iron rod refers to holding tightly to the gospel of Jesus Christ, which enable a person to avoid the temptations of the world or to stray from the strait and narrow path. #A mist of darkness,1 Nephi 8:23 symbolizing the temptations of the devil.1 Nephi 12:17 #A great and spacious building,1 Nephi 8:26-27 symbolizing the pride of the world.1 Nephi 11:36 The many inhabitants of the building mock and laugh at those who are on the strait and narrow path. Lehi sees in the vision that his sons Sam and Nephi, and his wife Sariah partake of the white fruit, indicating that they will be saved.1 Nephi 8:14-16 He sees that his sons Laman and Lemuel do not partake of the fruit. Importance The story of the vision is well known among members of the LDS Church and is widely cited. The \\"rod of iron\\" specifically is mentioned often referring to the scriptures or the words of the Lord, in order to convey the importance of heeding God's teachings. Izapa Stela 5 Some members of the LDS Church, including Jakeman, believe that Izapa Stela 5, an ancient stela found in ancient Mesoamerica in the 1930s, is a depiction of the tree of life vision.See Jakeman. This interpretation is not supported by mainstream scholars. Mesoamerican researchers identify the central image as a Mesoamerican world tree, connecting the sky above and the water or underworld below. Mesoamerican art scholar, Julia Guernsey Kappelman does not support this association between Izapa Stela 5 and the Book of Mormon. Kappelman has stated that Jakeman's research disregards the cultural context behind Izapa Stela 5 in favor of his own interpretations and biases.Guernsey, p. 53.

It was held on March 5, the anniversary of the 1770 Boston Massacre. History Each year a featured speaker would deliver an oration to commemorate the massacre. The speech would subsequently be printed. James Lovell delivered the first speech in 1771. Dr. Joseph Warren delivered the Massacre Day oration in 1772 and 1775. Benjamin Church was the featured speaker in 1773, followed the next year by John Hancock. In emotional language, the early speeches reminded listeners of the killings of civilians in Boston by British soldiers while touching upon themes such as the dangers of standing armies in times of peace and opposition to the policies of the British Parliament that the speakers believed violated colonial rights. The final observance of Massacre Day was in 1783. With the end of the American Revolutionary War and the securing of American independence, the Boston Board of Selectmen thought it was appropriate to replace the holiday with Independence Day, held on July 4 in honor of the Declaration of Independence. The final oration was delivered by the Rev.

It is now named Lafayette City Center. Creation and failure The complex was built in 1984 on a site which had included the old R. H. White department store. R. H. White had occupied an ornate six-floor emporium there from 1876 until going out of business in 1957, after which the building was occupied by the Citymart department store (1962‚Äì1966) and Raymond's department store (1966‚Äì1972), after which the building was torn down and replaced with a parking lot and then Layfayette Place. The original developer was Mondev (Montreal Development). Lafayette Place originally had a 500-room hotel (originally Hotel Lafayette, later a Swiss√¥tel and then a Hyatt) with of retail space. The project to build the mall also included an adjacent new downtown flagship store for Jordan Marsh (now Macy's). Located at the less desirable, more decayed end of the downtown shopping district (the same factor that had helped doom R. H. White, Citymart, and Raymond's, along with the continued flight of customers to suburban shopping malls), it never achieved greater than 60 percent occupancy. The interior mall had an unusual circular hallway arrangement which never became popular with shoppers. The long solid-brick facade presented a foreboding, lifeless aspect to pedestrians. It closed as a mall in 1989, ownership devolved to Chemical Bank, and the retail space remained empty for some years. Later developments Homart Development Company worked on redeveloping the property and reopening the mall in 1990s. Patriot Games LLC, a consortium of three companies, bought the property in 1997. Two stories were added and the complex was redeveloped as primarily office space, under the name Lafayette Corporate Center. State Street Corporation was an anchor tenant, leasing . Patriot Games sold the property in 2002 to The Abbey Group. State Street Corporation left in the 2010s for offices in the Fort Point Channel area. With the downtown shopping area showing new signs of vitality and a burgeoning resident population nearby, Abbey Group in 2014 redeveloped the complex, revived the retail space, and rebranded the complex as Lafayette City Center.

The history of the city is closely related to the rise of the Maratha empire from the 17th‚Äì18th century. During the 18th century, Pune became the political centre of the Indian subcontinent; as the seat of the Peshwas, who were the prime ministers of the Maratha Empire. After the fall of Peshwa rule in 1818, the new British rulers made the city one of their major military bases. Prior to the British takeover, the city was confined to the eastern bank of the Mutha river. Since then, the city has grown on both sides of the river. In the 19th and early 20th century, Pune was considered by the British as the center of political unrest against their rule. The post-independence era saw Pune emerging as a major manufacturing center. The post-independence period has also seen further growth in the higher education sector in the city. The Panshet flood of 1961 resulted in a huge loss of housing on the river bank and spurred the growth of new suburbs. In the 1990s, the city emerged as a major information technology hub.  Early and medieval  The circular Nandi Mandapa at the Pataleshwar cave temple, built during the Rashtrakuta dynasty is the oldest man-made structure in Pune The first reference to Pune region is found in two copper plates dated to 758 and 768 AD, issued by Rashtrakuta ruler Krishna I. The plates are known as \\"Puny Vishaya\\" and \\"Punaka Vishaya\\" respectively. The Pataleshwar rock-cut temple complex was built during this time, and this area consisted of Theur, Uruli, Chorachi Alandi, Bhosari, etc. Pune later became part of the Yadava Empire of Deogiri from the 9th century. During this time, it was called as \\"Punekavadi\\" and \\"Punevadi\\".In 2003, an accidental discovery of artefacts from the Satvahana period in the Kasba peth area of the city has put the origin of settled life in the area to around 200 BC. The Khalji dynasty overthrew the Yadavas in 1317. This started three hundred years of Islamic control of Pune. The Khalji dynasty was succeeded by another Delhi sultanate dynasty, the Tughlaqs. A governor of the Tughlaq for the Deccan revolted and created the independent Bahamani sultanate. The bahamanis, and their successor states, collectively called the Deccan sultanates, ruled Pune region between 1400 and early 1600s. During the Islamic era, the city was called \\"Kasabe Pune\\". A defensive wall around the city was built by Barya Arab, a commander of either the Khaljis or the Tughlaqs, in the early 1300s. Traditional accounts state that the temples of Puneshwar and Narayaneshwar were turned into the Sufi shrines of Younger Sallah and Elder Sallah respectively. During this period, Muslim soldiers and few civilian Muslims lived within the town walls, on the eastern bank of the Mutha River. The Brahmins, traders, and cultivators were pushed outside the town walls. The Hindu saint, Namdev (1270‚Äì1350) is believed to have visited the Kedareshwar temple. The Bengali saint, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu visited the place during the Nizamshahi rule.  Maratha rule  Pune first came under Maratha control in the early 1600s. However, control shifted between the Bhonsle family, the Adil Shahi dynasty, and the Mughals, for most of the century. In the early 1700s, Pune and its surrounding areas were granted to the newly appointed Maratha Peshwa, Balaji Vishwanath. It remained with his family until his great- grandson Bajirao II was defeated by the British East India Company in 1818. = Bhosale family fiefdom (1599‚Äì1714) = In 1595 or 1599, Maloji Bhosle, the grandfather of Shivaji, was given the title of \\"raja\\" by Bahadur Nizam Shah II, the ruler of the Ahmednagar Sultanate. On the recommendation of Nizam's Vazir, Malik Ambar, Maloji was granted the jagir (fiefdom) of the Pune and Supe parganas, along with the control over the Shivneri and Chakan forts. In 1630‚Äì31, Murar Jagdeo Pandit, a general of Adil Shahi of Bijapur attacked Pune and razed it to the ground by using ass-drawn ploughs, as a symbol of total dominance. Soon afterwards, Shahaji, the son of Maloji, joined the service of Adil Shahi, and got his family's jagir of Pune back in 1637. He appointed Dadoji Konddeo as the administrator of the area. Dadoji slowly rebuilt the city, and brought back the prominent families who had left the city during the destruction by Murar Jagdeo.Gadgil, D.R., 1945. Poona a socio-economic survey part I. Economics. Shahaji also selected Pune for the residence of his wife, Jijabai and son, Shivaji, the future founder of the Maratha empire. The construction of a palace, called Lal Mahal, was completed in 1640. Jijabai is said to have commissioned the building of the Kasba Ganapati temple herself. The Ganesh idol consecrated at this temple is regarded as the presiding deity (gramadevata) of the city. Pune changed hands between the Mughals and the Marathas many times during the rest of the century. It remained under Shivaji's control for the most part of his career, however, he operated from mountain forts like Rajgad and Raigad. Recognizing the military potential of Pune, the Mughal general Shaista Khan and later, the emperor Aurangzeb further developed the areas around the city. = Peshwa rule (1714‚Äì1818) = Shaniwar Wada, the palace and administrative headquarters built by Baji Rao I in 1730 Henry Salt. The picture clearly shows the permanent features of the place, namely, the Mula-mutha river, Parvati Hill and the towering Sinhagad in the background Vishrambag Wada was built for his Residence by Bajirao II in 1811. The building is still in use In 1714, the Maratha ruler Shahu appointed Balaji Vishwanath, a Chitpavan Brahmin, as his Peshwa. Around the same period, Balaji was gifted the area around Pune by the grateful mother of one of Shahu's ministers, the Pantsachiv, for saving the latter's life.Duff, J.G., 1990. History of the Marathas, Vol. I. Cf. MSG, p. 437. In 1720, Baji Rao I, was appointed Peshwa, as a successor to his father, by Shahu. Bajirao moved his administration from Saswad to Pune in 1728, and in the process, laid the foundation for turning what was a kasbah into a large city. Before Bajirao I made Pune his headquarters, the town already had six \\"Peths\\" or wards, namely, Kasba, Shaniwar, Raviwar, Somwar, Mangalwar, and Budhwar.Gadgil, D.R., 1945. Poona a socio-economic survey part I. Economics. page 14. Bajirao also started construction of a palace called Shaniwar Wada on the eastern bank of the Mutha River. The construction was completed in 1730, ushering in the era of Peshwa control over the city. The city grew in size and influence as the Maratha rule extended in the subsequent decades. During this period, in addition to being the administrative capital of the Confederacy, the city also became the financial capital of the Confederacy. Most of the 150 bankers or \\"savakars\\" in the city belonged to the Chitpavan or Deshastha Brahmin communities. The city gained further importance as the Maratha dominance increased across India under the rule of Bajirao I's son, Balaji Baji Rao, also known as Nanasaheb. After the disastrous Battle of Panipat in 1761, Maratha influence was curtailed. At that time, the Nizam of Hyderabad looted the city. The city and the empire recovered during the brief reign of Peshwa Madhavrao I. The rest of the Peshwa era was full of family intrigue and political machinations. The leading role in this was played by the ambitious Raghunathrao, the younger brother of Nanasaheb who wanted power at the expense of his nephews, Madhavrao I and Narayanrao. Following the murder of Narayanrao on the orders of Raghunathrao's wife, in 1775, power was exercised in the name of the son of Narayanrao, Madhavrao II, by a regency council led by Nana Fadnavis for almost the rest of the century. For most part, the Peshwa rule saw the city elites coming from the Chitpavan Brahmin community.They were the military commanders, the bureaucrats, and the bankers, and had ties to each other through matrimonial alliances.Review: Glory of Peshwa Pune Reviewed Work: Poona in the Eighteenth Century: An Urban History by Balkrishna Govind Gokhale Review by: Meera Kosambi Economic and Political Weekly Vol. 24, No. 5 (4 February 1989), pp. 247‚Äì250 Pune prospered as a city during the reign of the peshwas. Nanasaheb constructed a lake at Katraj, on the southern outskirts of the city, and an underground aqueduct, which is still operational, to bring water from the lake to Shaniwar Wada.Khare, K. C., and M. S. Jadhav. \\"Water Quality Assessment of Katraj Lake, Pune (Maharashtra, India): A Case Study. \\" Proceedings of Taal2007: The 12th World Lake Conference. Vol. 292. 2008. Later in the century, the city got an underground sewage system in 1782, that ultimately discharged into the river. On the southern fringe of the city, Nanasaheb built a palace on the Parvati Hill, developed a garden called Heera Baug, and dug a lake close to Parvati hill, with a Ganesh temple on an island in the middle of it. He also developed new commercial, trading, and residential localities called Sadashiv Peth, Narayan Peth, Rasta Peth, and Nana Peth. The city in the 1790s had a population of 600,000. In 1781, after a city census, household tax called Gharpatti was levied on the more affluent, which was one-fifth to one-sixth of the property value. Under Peshwa rule, law and order was exercised by the office of the Kotwal. The Kotwal was both the police chief, magistrate, as well as the municipal commissioner. His duties included investigating, levying, and collecting of fines for various offenses. The Kotwal was assisted by police officers who manned the chavdi or the police station, and the clerks collected the fines and the paid informants who provided the necessary intelligence for charging people with misdemeanor. The crimes included illicit affairs, violence, and murder. Sometimes, even in case of murder, only a fine was imposed. Inter-caste or inter-religious affairs were also settled with fines. The salary of the Kotwal was as high as 9000 rupees a month, but that included the expense of employing officers, mainly from the Ramoshi caste.India. Police Commission and India. Home Dept, 1913.

The most famous Kotwal of Pune during Peshwa rule was Ghashiram Kotwal. The police force during this era was admired by European visitors to the city. The patronage of the Brahmin Peshwas resulted in great expansion of Pune with the construction of around 250 temples and bridges in the city, including the Lakdi Pul and the temples on Parvati Hill.Preston, Laurence W. \\"Shrines and neighbourhood in early nineteenth-century Pune, India. \\" Journal of Historical Geography 28. 2 (2002): 203‚Äì215. Many of the Maruti, Vithoba, Vishnu, Mahadeo, Rama, Krishna, and Ganesh temples were built during this era. The patronage also extended to 164 schools or \\"pathshalas\\" in the city that taught Hindu holy texts or Shastras. However, the schools were open to men from the Brahmin castes only. The city also conducted many public festivals. The main festivals were Holi, the Deccan New year or Gudi padwa, Ganeshotsav, Dasara, and Dakshina. Holi at the court of Peshwa, used to be celebrated over a five-day period. The Dakshina festival celebrated in the Hindu month of Shraavana, when millions of rupees were distributed, attracted Brahmins from all over India to Pune.Adachi, K., 2001. \\"Dakshina Rules of Bombay Presidency (1836‚Äì1851)\\". Minamiajiakenkyu, 2001(13), pp. 24‚Äì51.Kyosuke Adachi, \\"Dakshina Rules of Bombay Presidency (183(‚àí1851): Its Constitution and Principles\\", Journal of the Japanese Association for South Asian Studies, 13, 2001 The festivals, the building of temples and the rituals conducted at temples, led to religion being responsible for about 15% of the city's economy during this period. The Peshwa rulers and the knights residing in the city also had their own hobbies and interests. For example, Madhavrao II had a private collection of exotic animals such as lions and rhinoceros, close to where the later Peshwe park zoo was situated. The last Peshwa, Bajirao II was a physical strength and wrestling enthusiast. The sport of pole gymnastics or Malkhamb was developed in Pune, under his patronage, by Balambhat Deodhar. Many Peshwas and the courtiers were patrons of Lavani, a genre of music and folk-dance popular in Maharashtra. A number of composers of it, such as Ram Joshi, Anant Phandi, Prabhakar, and Honaji Bala, come from this period. The dancers used to come from the castes such as Mang and Mahar.Rege, S., 1995. The hegemonic appropriation of sexuality: The case of the lavani performers of Maharashtra. Contributions to Indian Sociology, 29(1), pp. 25‚Äì37. http://sharmilarege.com/resources/Hegemonic%20Appropriation%20of%20Sexuality_Rege.pdf Lavani used to be an essential part of Holi celebrations at the court of Peshwa. The Peshwa's influence in India declined after the defeat of Maratha forces in the Battle of Panipat, but Pune remained the seat of power. The city's fortunes declined rapidly after the accession of Bajirao II to power in 1795. In 1802, Pune was captured by Yashwantrao Holkar in the Battle of Poona, directly precipitating the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803‚Äì1805. The Peshwa rule ended with the defeat of Bajirao II by the British East India Company, under the leadership of Mountstuart Elphinstone, in 1818.  British rule (1818‚Äì1947)  Map of Poona from 1914 In 1818, Pune and rest of the Peshwa territories came under the control of the British East India Company. The company rule came to an end when in 1858, under the terms of Proclamation issued by Queen Victoria, the Bombay Presidency, along with Pune and the rest of British India, came under the direct rule of the British crown. = City development = British rule over more than a century, saw huge changes that were seen in all spheres, social, economic, and others as well. The British built a large military cantonment to the east of the city.Moledina, M.H., 1953. History of the Poona Cantonment, 1818‚Äì1953 The settlement of the regiments of the 17 Poona Horse cavalry, the Lancashire Fusiliers, the Maratha Light Infantry, and others, led to an increase in the population. Due to its milder weather, the city became the \\"Monsoon capital\\" of the Governor of Bombay, thus making it one of the most important cities of the Bombay Presidency. The old city and the cantonment areas followed different patterns of development, with the latter being developed more on European lines to cater for the needs of the British military class. The old city had narrow lanes and areas segregated by caste and religion. For many decades, Pune was the center of social reform and at the turn of the century, the center of Indian Nationalism. British era also saw development on the western bank of the Mutha river, in the vicinity of the village of Bhamburde. alt= The population of the city was previously decreasing with the declining fortunes of the Peshwa rule. The population at the beginning of British rule was estimated at around 100,000, and it declined further as the city lost its stature as the seat of a major power. In the 1851 census, the population of the old-city (excluding cantonment) was down to 70,000. The population increased subsequently, following the introduction of railways, to 80,000 in 1864, 90,000 in 1872, and 100,000 in 1881. The population of greater Poona (including Cantonment, Khadki, and surrounding villages like Ghorpadi) in 1881 was 144,000. By 1931, it had increased to 250,000. In the 1890s, there was loss of population during the bubonic plague, due to mortality from the disease as well as people leaving the city to escape the disease. The population bounced back in the following decades, due to introduction and acceptance of vaccination by the Indian population of the city. During the British era, the vast majority of the old city population was Marathi-speaking Hindus. Other significant minorities were Muslims, Christians and Roman Catholics, Parsis, Jews, Gujaratis, and Marwadis. During this period, the city-population was heavily segregated by caste and economic status.Mehta, Surinder K (1968): \\"Patterns of Residence in Poona (India) by Income, Education, and Occupation (1937‚Äì65), \\" American Journal of Sociology, pp 496‚Äì508. Gothic style, The synagogue was built by David Sassoon in 1867. The Poona Municipality was established in 1858. The cantonment area had its own separate administration from the beginning, and is governed separately even today. Unlike the Bombay Municipal council, the Poona Municipality had two- thirds members elected. In case of Bombay, it was only half the members. Due to the colonial government of the Presidency setting up property and educational qualifications to hold office, majority of the seats on the corporation were held by Maharashtrian Brahmins, who accounted for 20% of the city's population in the late 1800s. A significant number of seats were also held by non-Maharashtrian Hindus (Gujarati, south Indian, etc.) and Parsis. Social reformer, Jyotirao Phule was appointed to the council in the 1870s. The position of District Collector was created by the East India company at the beginning of its rule, and has been retained after Independence. Pune and the Pune district also had a collector, who had broad administrative power of revenue collection and judicial duties. When Pune and the Peshwa territories came under the company rule, Governor of the Bombay Presidency, Mountstuart Elphinstone wanted to retain many practices of the old order, including justice.Wheeler, M., 1960. The Cambridge History of India. CUP Archive. He continued the practice of Panchayat (a jury of local elders) to adjudicate in civil cases, however, the litigants preferred the parallel courts modelled on the English judicial system. Trial by jury was introduced in Pune in 1867. The Aga Khan Palace was constructed by Aga Khan III in 1892. For most of the British era, Pune remained a poor cousin of Mumbai when it came to industrialization. There were, however, a few industrial concerns active at the turn of the 20th century, such as a paper mill, metal forge works, and a cotton mill. An ammunition factory was set up in Khadki in 1869. Printing contributed significantly to the city's economy, due to the presence of large number of educational establishments in the city. To a major extent, manufacturing was a small-scale business. Cotton and silk weaving were major industries that grew in the 19th century. The same was true of brass and copper-ware. The latter actually developed after the advent of railways made importation of sheet metal easier. Other small industries included jewelry, beedi-making, leather-works, and food processing. Towards the end of the British era, movie-making had become a significant business, with eminent studios like the Prabhat Film Company located in the city. In the early years of the British rule, an open-air vegetable market used to be held outside the Shaniwar Wada. This shifted to an indoor place built by the Poona Municipality, which was inaugurated in 1886. The market was named after the then Governor of Bombay, Lord Reay, and served as retail and wholesale market in addition to being the municipal office. There was also an older market- district called Tulshi Baug, close to the vegetable market that sold a variety of household items.Shankar, V.K. and Sahni, R., 2012, November. Chinese Goods for Indian Gods. In Symposium on India-China Studies held at the University of Delhi (New Delhi) during (Vol. 2, p. 3). Mahatma Phule Mandai ‚Äì The market was built by the Poona Municipality and opened in 1886. The market at that time was called Reay Market and also served as Municipality office. During the first and second Anglo-Maratha wars, it used to take 4‚Äì5 weeks to move materials from Mumbai to Pune. A military road constructed by the company in 1804 reduced the journey to 4‚Äì5 days. The company later built a Macademized road in 1830, that allowed mail-cart service to begin between the two cities. Railway line from Bombay, which was operated by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR), reached the city in 1858. In the following decades, the line was extended to places farther east and south of the city. In the east, GIPR extended its line till Raichur in 1871, where it met a line of Madras Railway and thereby connected Poona to Madras. The Pune-Miraj line was completed in 1886. The completion of the Metre-gauge Miraj line turned the city into an important railway junction. The Bombay-Poona line was electrified in the 1920s. This cut the travel time between the cities to three hours and made it possible to make day-trips between the cities for business or leisure, such as the wealthy people from Bombay visiting the city to see the Poona races. Although railways came to Pune in the middle of the 19th century, public-bus service took nearly ninety-years to follow suit. Unlike Mumbai, Pune never had a tram service. The first bus service was introduced in Pune in 1941, by the Silver bus company. This caused huge uproar amongst the Tanga carriers (horse- drawn carriage) who went on strike in protest. Tangas were the common mode of public transport well into the 1950s. Bicycles were choice of vehicle for private use in the 1930s. Given the importance of Pune as a major Military base, the British were quick to install the instant communication system of Telegraph in the city in 1858.Gorman, M., 1971. Sir William O'Shaughnessy, Lord Dalhousie, and the Establishment of the Telegraph System in India. Technology and Culture, 12(4), pp. 581‚Äì601. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Poona (2 pts) of 1885 reports that, in 1885, the city had its own telegraph office in addition to the GIPR company's telegraph service. The city was a post-distribution hub for the district. There were two post offices in the city, which in addition to mailing services, offered money order and savings bank services. In 1928, a beam relay station was installed in Khadki to beam radiotelegraph signals for Imperial Wireless Chain system. Summer residence of the British Governor of Bombay presidency at Ganesh Khind. The building is now the flagship building of Savitribai Phule Pune University Areas east of Pune receive much less rainfall than the areas in the west of city, adjacent to the Sahyadri mountains. To minimize the risk of drought in the low rainfall areas, a masonry dam was built on the Mutha river at Khadakwasla in 1878. At that time, the dam was considered one of the largest in the world. Two canals were dug on each bank of the river, for irrigating lands to the east of the city. The canals also supplied drinking water to the city and Pune cantonment. In 1890, Poona Municipality spent Rs. 200,000 to install water filtration works. Electricity was first introduced in the city in 1920. In the early part of the 20th century, hydroelectric plants were installed in the Western Ghats between Pune and Mumbai. The Poona electric supply company, a Tata concern, received power from Khopoli on the Mumbai side of the ghats, and Bhivpuri plants near the Mulshi dam. The power was used for the electric trains running between Mumbai and Pune, for industry and domestic use. Nutan Marathi Vidyalaya boys' school founded in 1883 To cater for the religious and educational needs of the British-Christian soldiers and officers from the Anglo-Indian , Goan-Luso-Indian and Eurasian (mixed ancestry) communities, the early colonial period saw the building of many Protestant and Catholic churches and schools, such as The Bishop's School (Pune), Hutchings High School, and St. Mary's School, Pune. St. Vincent's High School, St. Anne's School (Pune) were other schools founded in the 1800s to cater to the Catholic community.\\"Anglican Scholastic Heritage in Poona 1818‚Äì1947\\", Research Article, Historicity Research Journal Volume 2  Issue 9  May 2016 Pramila Dasture In the 1820s, the company government set up a Hindu college, to impart education in Sanskrit. In the 1840s, the college started offering a more contemporary curriculum. The college was then renamed as Poona College, and later Deccan College. The 1800s also witnessed tremendous activity in setting up schools and colleges by early nationalists. For example, Bal Gangadhar Tilak was one of the founders of the Deccan Education Society. The society set up the New English school as well as the renowned Fergusson College. Another nationalist, Vasudev Balwant Phadke was co-founder of the Maharashtra Education Society. Both the Deccan and Maharashtra education society run numerous schools and colleges till date, in Pune, and in other cities, such as Abasaheb Garware College. The Shikshan Prasarak Mandali was responsible for setting up the Nutan Marathi Vidyalaya school for boys in 1883, and the SP College for higher education in 1916. The colonial era also saw the opening of schools for girls and the Untouchable castes. The pioneers in this task were the husband and wife duo of Jyotirao Phule and Savitribai Phule, who set up the first girls' school in Pune in 1848. Later in the century in 1885, Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade and R. G. Bhandarkar founded the first and renowned girls' high school in Pune, called Huzurpaga.Ghurye, G. S. (1954). Social Change in Maharashtra, II. Sociological Bulletin, page 51. SNDT Women's University, the first university for women in India, was founded in Pune by Dhondo Keshav Karve in 1916. Early during British rule, in the 1830s, the \\"Poona Engineering Class and Mechanical School\\" was established to train subordinate officers for carrying out public-works like buildings, dams, canals, railways, and bridges.Henry Herbert Dodwell (1929). The Cambridge History of the British Empire. CUP ArchiveA. A. Ghatol, S. S. Kaptan, A. A. Ghatol, K. K. Dhote (1 January 2004). Industry Institute Interaction. Sarup & Sons. pp. 61‚Äì. . Later on, in the year 1864, the school became the \\"Poona Civil Engineering College.\\" The number of courses were increased to include forestry and agricultural subjects, which led to its name being changed to Poona College of Science. All non-engineering courses were stopped by 1911, and the college was renamed as Government College of Engineering, Poona. Lord Reay Industrial Museum, which was one of the few industrial museums in colonial times, was established in Pune in 1890. Western Medical education started in Pune with the establishment of the BJ Medical school in 1871. The Sassoon Hospital was also started around the same time, with the help of the philanthropist Sassoon family in 1868.Mutalik, Maitreyee. \\"Review of Body Snatching to Body Donation: Past and Present: A Comprehensive Update.,Int J Pharm Bio Sci 2015 July; 6(3): (B) 428 ‚Äì 439\\" A regional mental asylum at Yerwada was established in the late 1800s. thumbrightStamp issued to honor Damodar Chapekar, one of the brothers who shot British colonial official W.C. Rand for his handling of the bubonic plague outbreak in 1897 Poona was a very important military base with a large cantonment during this era. The cantonment had a significant European population of soldiers, officers, and their families. A number of public health initiatives were undertaken during this period ostensibly to protect the Indian population, but mainly to keep Europeans safe from the periodic epidemics of diseases like Cholera, bubonic plague, small pox, etc. The action took form in vaccinating the population and better sanitary arrangements. The Imperial Bacteriological laboratory was first opened in Pune in 1890, but later moved to Muktesar in the hills of Kumaon. Given the vast cultural differences, and at times the arrogance of colonial officers, the measures led to public anger. The most famous case of the public anger was in 1897, during the bubonic plague epidemic in the city. By the end of February 1897, the epidemic was raging with a mortality rate twice the norm and half the city's population had fled. A Special Plague Committee was formed under the chairmanship of W.C. Rand, an Indian Civil Services officer. He brought European troops to deal with the emergency. The heavy handed measures he employed included forcibly entering peoples' homes, at times in the middle of the night and removing infected people and digging up floors, where it was believed in those days that the plague bacillus bacteria resided. These measures were deeply unpopular. Tilak fulminated against the measures in his newspapers, Kesari and Maratha. The resentment culminated in Rand and his military escort being shot dead by the Chapekar brothers on 22 June 1897. A memorial to the Chapekar brothers exists at the spot on Ganesh Khind Road. The assassination led to a re-evaluation of public health policies. This led even Tilak to support the vaccination efforts later in 1906. In the early 20th century, the Poona Municipality ran clinics dispensing Ayurvedic and regular English medicine. Plans to close the former in 1916 led to protest, and the municipality backed down. Later in the century, Ayurvedic medicine was recognized by the government and a training hospital called Ayurvedic Mahavidyalaya with 80 beds was established in the city. The Seva sadan institute led by Ramabai Ranade was instrumental in starting training in nursing and midwifery at the Sassoon Hospital. A maternity ward was established at the KEM Hospital in 1912. Availability of midwives and better medical facilities was not enough for high infant mortality rates. In 1921, the infant mortality rate was at a peak of 876 deaths per 1000 births. = Center of social reform and nationalism = Jyotirao Phule, social reformer The city was an important centre of social and religious reform movements, as well as the nationalist movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Notable civil-societies founded or active in the city during the 19th century include the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, the Prarthana samaj, the Arya Mahila Samaj, and the Satya Shodhak Samaj. The Sarvajanik Sabha took an active part in relief efforts during the famine of 1875‚Äì76. The Sabha is considered the forerunner of the Indian National Congress, established in 1885. Two of the most prominent personalities of Indian Nationalism in the late 19th and early 20th century, Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who were on opposite sides of the political spectrum, called Pune their home. The city was also a centre of social reform led by Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, Justice Ranade, feminist Tarabai Shinde, Dhondo Keshav Karve, Vitthal Ramji Shinde, and Pandita Ramabai.Ramachandra Guha, \\"The Other Liberal Light, \\" New Republic 22 June 2012 Most of the early social reform and nationalist leaders of stature in Pune were from the Brahmin caste, who belonged to the Congress party or its affiliated groups. The non-Brahmins in the city started organizing in the early 1920s, under the leadership of Keshavrao Jedhe and Baburao Javalkar. Both belonged to the Non-Brahmin party. Capturing the Ganpati and Shivaji festivals from Brahmin domination were their early goals. They combined nationalism with anti-casteism as the party's aim. Later on in the 1930s, Jedhe merged the non-Brahmin party with the Congress party, and transformed the party from an upper-caste dominated body to a more broadly based, but also Maratha-dominated party in Pune and other parts of Maharashtra. Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned several times at Yerwada Central Jail. The historic Poona Pact, between B.R. Ambedkar and Gandhi on reserved seats for the untouchable castes, was signed in 1932. Gandhi was placed under house arrest at the Aga Khan Palace in 1942‚Äì44, where both his wife, and aide Mahadev Desai died. = Culture = Lokmanya Tilak, a major figure in the Indian independence movement The social reformers and nationalist leaders in the city were greatly aided by the availability of printing presses. The Chitrashala press and the Aryabhushan press of Vishnu Shastri Chiplunkar, were the notable printing presses based in Pune in the 19th century. The first Marathi newspapers published from the city were Mitrodaya in 1844 and Dnyanprakash in 1849. Christian missionaries based in Bombay and Pune started a journal called Dnyanodaya in the 1840s, to criticise Hindu social customs as well as to impart knowledge on secular subjects such as science and medicine. In reply to the missionary criticism, Krishna Shastri Chiplunkar and Vishnu Bhikaji Gokhale started Vicharlahari and Vartaman Dipika respectively in 1852. Later in the 19th century, Tilak and Agarkar started the English newspaper Mahratta and the Marathi paper, Kesari, respectively. These papers were printed at the Aryabhushan press. After ideological differences with Tilak, Agarkar left Kesari and started his own reformist paper, Sudharak. Most of the above papers were either run by Brahmins or catered to the upper castes. The Bombay journals, Deenbandhu and Vitalwidhvansak, established in 1877 and 1886 respectively, catered to the non-Brahmin castes, and especially propagated the anti-caste philosophy of Mahatma Phule. In the early 20th century, a number of newspapers were established or had a special Pune edition. Prabhat in the 1940s, was the first one anna newspaper that catered to the lower income classes. The Sakal started by Nanasaheb Parulekar in 1931 is the most popular Marathi daily in the city to this day.Prabhu, M.P., History of Press in Maharashtra. SHODH PRERAK, pp. 291‚Äì295. The public Ganeshotsav festival, popular in many parts of India in modern times was started in Pune in 1892, by a group of young Hindu men.Kaur, R. (2003). Performative politics and the cultures of Hinduism: Public uses of religion in western India. Anthem Press, pp. 38‚Äì48. https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr;=&id;=WPMj14o4dgoC&oi;=fnd&pg;=PP2&dq;=poona+%22public+space%22&ots;=Yw9t8J4P4k&sig;=fQwP3vi6EmBIiQQPvlLJHtiBP9o#v=onepage&q;=pune&f;=false However, it was Nationalist leader, Tilak who transformed the annual domestic festival into a large, well-organised public event.Metcalf and Metcalf, p. 150. Tilak recognized Ganesha's appeal as \\"the god for everybody\\",Momin, A. R., The Legacy Of G. S. Ghurye: A Centennial Festschrift, p. 95.For Ganesha's appeal as \\"the god for everyman\\" as a motivation for Tilak, see: Brown (1991), p. 9. popularising Ganesh Chaturthi as a national festival to \\"bridge the gap between Brahmins and 'non-Brahmins' and find a context in which to build a new grassroots unity between them\\", generating nationalistic fervour in the Maharashtrian people to oppose British colonial rule.Brown (1991), p. 9.For Tilak's role in converting the private family festivals to a public event in support of Indian nationalism, see: Thapan, p. 225. For Tilak as the first to use large public images in ' (pavilions or tents) see: Thapan, p. 225. Until then, Hindus in Pune participated in the Shia Muslim festival of Muharram, by making donations and making the Tazia. There were about 100 public Ganpatis installed in the late 1800s. This increased to about 300, at the end of British rule.Kaur, R. (2003). Performative politics and the cultures of Hinduism: Public uses of religion in western India. Anthem Press, page 60. Encouraged by Tilak, Ganesh Chaturthi facilitated community participation when the British on the other hand discouraged social and political gatherings, to control unrest by the Indian population. The festival allowed public entertainment in the form of intellectual discourse, poetry recitals, plays, concerts, and folk dances. In 1895, Lokmanya Tilak also took a lead in public celebration of the birthday of Shivaji, the founder of Maratha empire. Justice Ranade started the spring lecture series called Vasant Vyakhyanmala in 1875. During the lengthy period of British rule, many different forms of entertainment became popular and subsequently faded in Pune. In the 1840s, plays based on stories from the Hindu epics such as Ramayana and Mahabharat were made popular by the traveling troupes of Vishnudas Bhave. For the next forty years, plays by the traveling troupes and performances in tents or even private dwellings were extremely popular among the Marathi speaking population of the city.Kulkarni, K.A., 2015. The Popular Itinerant Theatre of Maharashtra, 1843‚Äì1880. Asian Theatre Journal, 32(1), pp. 190‚Äì227. The Marathi musical theater of the later period was built on the foundation of the travelling theatre. Another art form popular in this era was Lavani and Tamasha, danced and performed at the Aryabhushan theater. The city was a pioneer in the movie business, with companies like Prabhat studios producing quality movies. The first movie theatre in Pune was called Aryan Theatre. After the advent of talkies in the 1930s, the word (talkies) was used to denote a cinema hall. Most of the early halls had western names, such as Minerva, Globe, Liberty, etc.Cricketer Palwankar Baloo The British rulers of India loved outdoor sports and built facilities for their leisure. British rule in Pune saw both the introduction of British sports such as cricket, and the development of the new game of Badminton.Tennyson, C., 1959. They taught the world to play. Victorian Studies, 2(3), pp. 211‚Äì222. The building of a low dam at Bund gardens, financed by Parsi businessman, Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy in 1860, allowed boating on the Mula-Mutha river for recreation. The cantonment area of the city had a race course which still hosts horse racing. The British also built a golf course, which is still operational as the Poona Golf club in a presently sub-urban setting. There were exclusively-white clubs such as Poona Europeans, and clubs based on religion such as Poona Parsees and Poona Hindu Gymkhana, for Cricket, by the end of the 19th century. The latter club was dominated by the educated Brahmin caste of the city. However, two lower- caste brothers from the city, became stars of Indian cricket in the early 20th century. They were Palwankar Baloo and his brother, Vithal Palwankar. Vithal was appointed the captain of the Hindus in a quadrilateral cricket tournament between the Hindus, Parsis, Muslims, and Europeans. British rule also saw a parallel development of indigenous sports at the traditional akhada or talim. However, the 1897 assassination of Rand by the Chapekar brothers, who ran a talim in Pune called Gophan, led to these venues being viewed with suspicion by the colonial authorities, for being potential centers of extremist views. The committee to set rules for Kho-kho was established in the city in 1914.Mahesh, D., 2015. A Comparative Study of Physical Fitness Among Kho-Kho and Kabaddi Male Players. International Journal, 3(7), pp. 1594‚Äì1597. The Deccan Gymkhana sports club formed in the early 20th century was instrumental in organizing the first Indian delegation to an Olympic meeting at Antwerp in 1920 The Maharashtra Mandal club formed in the early 20th century, took the lead in promoting physical culture and education. The club promoted both indigenous as well as western sports.  Post-Independence (1947‚Äìpresent)  The Mutha river between Onkareshwar temple and Shivaji bridge in the 1980s The period between 1947 and the present day saw Pune turning from a mid-size city to a large metropolis. This period saw a huge influx of people to the city due to opportunities offered by the boom in the manufacturing industry, and lately in the software field. The influx has been from other areas of Maharashtra as well as from outside the state. The Indian Government embarked on a period of economic liberalization in 1991 that had a tremendous influence on the growth of the city, and therefore the post-independence period can be divided into two periods of 1947‚Äì1991 and 1991‚Äìpresent. After gaining independence from British rule in 1947, Pune became part of the Bombay state. Just after a year of independence, Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated in 1948. Gandhi's assassin, Nathuram Godse and most of his fellow conspirators were from Pune. In 1950s, Pune came at the forefront of the struggle for a unified state of Maharashtra for the Marathi speakers. Many leaders of the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti, such as Keshavrao Jedhe, S.M. Joshi, Shripad Amrit Dange, Nanasaheb Gore and Prahlad Keshav Atre, were based in Pune. After the spectacular success of the Samiti in Marathi speaking areas, the Congress party government at the center agreed to merge Marathi speaking areas into the newly created state of Maharashtra in 1960, with Pune as one of its leading cities.Dialogue with Life ‚Äì Madhu Dandavate ‚Äì Google Books. Books. google.com.ni. Retrieved on 29 July 2013. The city has been part of the Pune Lok sabha constituency since independence. Since independence, the city has more often than not, elected candidates from the Congress party such as Vithalrao Gadgil, and in recent past, Suresh Kalmadi who was charged with corruption. The city elected opposition candidates in times of crisis, such as Nanasaheb Gore during the struggle for united Maharashtra in 1957, or Mohan Dharia after the lifting of Emergency in 1977. The city and its surrounding areas have six single-member constituencies for Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha. The Congress party or its breakaway factions such as NCP, have historically dominated elections to this body. = City growth and development = The population of the city grew rapidly after independence, from nearly 0.5‚Äì0.8 million in 1968 to 1. 5 million in 1976. By 1996, the population had increased to 2.5 million.ASTROP, A, C PALMER, D MAUNDER AND D M BABU. (1 996).

The city until the 1970s was referred to as \\"Pensioners' Paradise\\", since many government officers, civil engineers, and Army personnel preferred to settle down in Pune after their retirementBurte, H., 1993. Contemporary Architecture. Architecture Plus Design, 10(6), p. 85. The status of Pune was elevated from town to city, when the Municipality was converted into Pune Mahanagar Palika or the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in the year 1950.PMC In order to integrate planning, the Pune Metropolitan Region covering the areas under PMC, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, the three cantonments, and the surrounding villages was defined in 1967. Industrial development started in the 1950s, in the outlining areas of the city such as Hadapsar, Bhosari, and Pimpri. The first big operation to set up shop was the government run Hindustan Antibiotics in Pimpri in 1954. The area around Bhosari was set aside for industrial development, by the newly created MIDC in the early 1960s. MIDC provided the necessary infrastructure for new businesses to set up operations. Telco (now Tata Motors) started operations in 1961, which gave a huge boost to the automobile sector. After 1970, Pune emerged as the leading engineering city of the country with Telco, Bajaj, Kinetic, Bharat Forge, Alfa Laval, Atlas Copco, Sandvik, and Thermax expanding their infrastructure. This allowed the city to compete with Chennai for the title of \\"Detroit of India\\" at that time. The growth in the Pimpri Chinchwad and Bhosari areas allowed these areas to incorporate as the separate city of Pimpri-Chinchwad. In light of the rapid growth, the Pune metropolitan area was defined in 1967. It includes Pune, the three cantonment areas and numerous surrounding suburbs. After the 1991 economic liberalization, Pune began to attract foreign capital, particularly in the information technology and engineering industries. During the three years before 2000, Pune saw huge development in the Information Technology sector, and IT Parks were set up in Aundh, Hinjewadi, and Nagar road By 2005, Pune overtook both Mumbai and Chennai to have more than 200,000 IT professionals. In the year 2008, many multinational automobile companies like General Motors, Volkswagen, and Fiat, set up facilities near Pune in the Chakan and Talegaon areas. A crowded street in Pune in 2004 Public transport in form of bus service, was introduced in the city just before independence using a private provider. The city took over the service after independence, as Poona Municipal transport (PMT). In the 1990s the PMT and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Transport (PCMT), the bus company running the service in Pimpri- Chinchwad, had a combined fleet of over a thousand buses. Several employers from the Industrial belt near Pimpri ‚Äì Chinchwad and Hadapsar, also offered private bus service to their employees due to patchy municipal transport.Maunder, D, C Palmer, a Astrop and M Babu (1997). Attitudes and travel behaviour of residents in Pune, India. Transportation Research Board, 76th Annual Meeting, Washington D.C., 12‚Äì17 January 1997http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.572.912&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf. The number of buses belonging to these companies was several times more than the number of Municipal buses. The two bus companies merged in 2007 to form the PMML. In 2006, the city was the first in India to develop the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRT), but due to a number of factors the project ran into delays. In 2008, the Commonwealth Youth Games took place in the city, which encouraged additional development in the north-west region of the city, and added a fleet of buses running on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). Pune was also connected to other towns and cities in Maharashtra by Maharashtra State Transport buses that began operating in 1951. From the 1960s onward, horse- drawn Tanga was gradually replaced by the motorized three-wheeler Autorickshaw, for intermediate public transport. Their number grew from 200 in 1960, to over 20,000 in 1996. From the 1930s, Pune was known as the cycle city of India. However, the cycle was replaced by motorized two-wheelers from the 1970s onward. For example, the number of two-wheelers increased from 5 per 1000 people, to 118 per 1000, in the period between 1965‚Äì1995. In 1989, Dehu Road-Katraj bypass (Western bypass) was completed, reducing traffic congestion in the inner city but also leading to growth in Industry as well as housing along the bypass, in the decades following the opening of the road. In 1998, work on the six-lane Mumbai-Pune expressway began, and was completed in 2001. This toll-road significantly reduced the journey time between the two cities. In 1951, a number of Railway companies including GIPR, merged to form the Central Railway zone, with Pune as an important railway junction. The pace of laying down new rail tracks had been slow in the initial post-independence era. Nevertheless, one of the major infrastructure project in this period was conversion of the Pune-Miraj railway from metre gauge to the wider broad-gauge in 1972. Pune has been an important base for armed forces. The airport established by the British at Lohgaon in 1939, was further developed by the Indian Air Force. The airport was used for domestic short-haul passenger flights until 2005, when the airport was upgraded to international airport with flights to Dubai, Singapore, and Frankfurt. In 2004‚Äì05, Pune Airport handled about 165 passengers a day. It increased to 250 passengers a day in 2005‚Äì06. There was a sharp rise in 2006‚Äì07, when daily passengers reached to 4,309. In 2010‚Äì 2011, the passenger number hit about 8,000 a day. Expansion of Pune In 1961, the Panshet Dam which was then under construction, failed. The breach released a tremendous volume of water, which also damaged the downstream dam of Khadakwasla. The resulting flood damaged or destroyed a lot of old housing near the river bank, in the Narayan, Shaniwar, and Kasba Peth areas of the city. The damaged dams were repaired and continue to provide water to the city. The rapid rise in the city population in the last few decades, meant that the sewage treatment plants in 2008 were treating just over half of the sewage and discharging the rest in the local Mutha and Mula rivers, that severely polluted these rivers. The rapid industrialization led to a huge influx of new people to the city, with housing supply not keeping pace with demand, and therefore there was a great increase in slum dwellings in this period. In the post-Panshet period, new housing was mainly in the form of bungalows and apartment buildings. In the 1980s, however, due to heavy demand for housing, there was a trend towards knocking down bungalows and converting them into apartment buildings, with a consequent increase in population density and increased demand for utilities such as water supply. Since the 1990s, a number of landmark integrated townships have come into being in the city, such as Magarpatta, Nanded, Amanora, Blue Ridge, Life Republic, and Lavasa. Most of these were built by private developers and also managed privately. In 1949, University of Poona was established with 18 affiliated colleges in 13 districts of Bombay state surrounding Pune. The creation of the university was opposed by some groups that had been running the long established colleges in the city. The post-independence period also saw the establishment of the National Defence Academy at Khadakwasla, Film and Television Institute of India at the former Prabhat studios in 1960, and National Chemical Laboratory at Pashan. Pune was also made the headquarters of the Southern Command of the Indian Army. Many private colleges and universities were set up in the city during the years after the State Government under chief minister Vasantdada Patil liberalised the Education Sector in 1982. Politicians and leaders involved in the huge cooperative movement in Maharashtra were instrumental in setting up the private institutes. = Culture = Balgandharv Rangmandir, the premier theatre built in 1960s Sarasbaug, a park established in the 1960s on the site of the Peshwa era lake A number of newspapers from the British era, continued publishing decades after independence. These included Kesari, Tarun Bharat, Prabhat, and Sakal. After independence, Kesari took a more pro-Congress party stance, whereas Tarun Bharat was sympathetic towards Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Jan sangh and its successor, the BJP. Under the leadership of Nanasaheb Parulekar, Sakal maintained a politically-neutral stand. It was the most popular Marathi daily during Parulekar's stewardship, and has maintained that position since the 1980s, under the control of Pawar family.SMT. CLAUDE-LILA PARULEKAR versus M/S. SAKAL PAPERS PVT. LTD Presently, Kesari is only published as an online newspaper. Mumbai-based Maharashtra times, Loksatta, and Lokmat, introduced Pune-based editions in the last fifteen years. The Mumbai-based popular English newspaper, Indian express has a Pune edition. Its rival, the Times of India introduced a tabloid called Pune Mirror in 2008. The government-owned All India radio (AIR) established a station in Pune in October 1952.http://www.sakaaltimes.com/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=4738872096124627297&SectionId;=5131376722999570563&SectionName;=Features&NewsTitle;=Its%20in%20the%20AIR One of the early notable programs produced by the station was Geet Ramayan, a series of 55 songs created by the poet Ga Di Madgulkar and composer Sudhir Phadke in 1955 AIR Doordarshan service started relaying black and white television signals, from Bombay TV-station to Pune in 1973. A relay station was built at the fort of Sinhagad to receive signals. Color service was introduced to Pune and rest of India during the 1982 Asian Games. Since the British era, live theater in form of musical drama had been popular in Pune and other Marathi speaking areas. In the post-independence era, theater became a minor pursuit, and the genre of musical-drama declined due to cost. Despite lower attendance, the post-independence era saw the building of many new drama theaters by the Pune Municipal corporation, such as the Bal Gandharva Ranga Mandir in the 1960s, and Yashwantrao Chavan Natya Gruha in the 1990s. Theater companies such as Theatre academy, flourished in the 1970s with plays such as Ghashiram Kotwal and Mahanirvan. The popular entertainment for masses in Pune and in urban India, in the post-independence era was cinema. Theaters showing single-films were dotted around the old city. The early theaters used to be quite basic with regard to comfort and technology. In the 1970s, new theaters were built that were fully air-conditioned, with some of them such as Rahul Theater, having a wide-format screen for showing 70 mm films. The theaters used to show mostly Hindi films, and a few Marathi and English ones. The post-1991 liberalization period saw the rise of multiplex cinemas and decline of the old theaters. For a city of its size, Pune always had very few public parks. The Bund Garden and the Empress Gardens were developed during the British era, in the Cantonment area. In the post-independence era, the Peshwe Park and Zoo was developed in 1953, by the Municipal corporation, close to Parvati hill, at the same location where Sawai Madhavrao had his own collection of animals. The Peshwa-era lake, next to the park with a Ganesh temple, was drained and turned into a garden in the 1960s and named Saras Baug. The Parvati and Taljai hills behind it, were turned into a protected nature reserve called Pachgaon hill in the 1980s. The reserve contains area under forest, and is a stop for migratory birds.Bhaskar, P., 2012. \\"Urbanization and changing green spaces in Indian cities (Case study‚ÄìCity of Pune)\\". International Journal of Geology, Earth and Environmental Sciences, 2, pp. 148‚Äì156. Maharashtra Cricket Association was formed in the 1930s, and has been based in Pune since then. In 1969, the headquarters of the association was moved to 25,000 capacity Nehru stadium. With the introduction of the limited-over game and low capacity of the stadium, the association built a new and larger capacity stadium on the outer fringes of the city. In the 1970s, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Stadium was built in the Mangalwar Peth area of the city, to host Kusti and other traditional Indian sports. The 1994 National games were hosted by the city. A new sports venue called Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex was built at Balewadi for this purpose. The complex was also used for 2008 Commonwealth youth games. Maharashtrian Hindu society until the early 20th century, was fairly conservative with regard to food and there were few conventional restaurants in Pune. The early restaurants in the city, mainly in the cantonment area, were established by Parsis and Iranians. Lucky and Cafe Good Luck were the first Irani restaurants in the Deccan Gymkhana area, near the Ferguson College. For many young men from orthodox- Hindu vegetarian families, ordering an omelette at these restaurants was considered quite daring.Platz, T., 2012. Caf√© culture: Socio-historical transformations of space, personhood and middle class in Pune, India (Doctoral dissertation, Durham University), Page=52 . The first family restaurant in Deccan Gymkhana area, Cafe Unique, was started by a Mr. Bhave in the 1930s. In the post-independence era, a number of restaurants were established by immigrants from the coastal Udupi district in Karnataka. These establishments offered a simple South Indian meal of Dosa and Idlis. The early post- independence era also saw opening of the iconic Chitale Bandhu sweet shops, that offered Maharashtrian sweet and savory snacks. After the 1991 market liberalization, the city became more cosmopolitan, and several American franchise-restaurants, such as McDonald's,Dashi, K., 2005. McDonald's in India.

The angle of the paddle increases as the volume of drilling fluid increases and pushes it out further and vice versa. The purpose of the flow show is to allow the driller (and other rig personnel) to monitor the flow of drilling fluid as it comes out of the hole. The reason for monitoring the flow: *If a high pressure zone is drilled and overcomes the hydrostatic pressure of the column of drilling fluid, the fluid or gas in the high-pressure zone will begin to enter the borehole and increase the amount of fluid coming out of the hole. By monitoring the flow, rig personnel will know in advance before the flow becomes critical. *If a low pressure zone is drilled and is overcome by the hydrostatic pressure of the column of drilling fluid, the low pressure zone may begin to take fluid and decrease the amount of fluid coming out of the hole. By monitoring the flow, rig personnel will know in advance before losing too much drilling fluid (which is typically very expensive) down the hole and/or losing so much fluid that the hydrostatic pressure of the (decreasing) column of mud becomes so low that a blowout situation becomes imminent.

He competed for his native country at three consecutive Olympics (1980‚Äì88). As of May 2009, his is the only Colombian to ever reach an Olympic Swimming Final. He attended college in the United States at Southern Illinois University. He participated in the Central American and Caribbean Games in his native Medellin (1978), but it was his participation in the 1979 Pan American Games in San Juan, Puerto Rico that showed his capacity, where he won a bronze medal in 200-metre breaststroke. In 1980, he swam at the Moscow Olympics, where he became the first Colombian swimmer to reach an Olympic Final: in the 100-metre final. He finished seventh in 1:05.91 in Moscow (more than two seconds behind the winner Duncan Goodhew). The hope for an Olympic medal would begin two years later at the 1982 World Championships in Guayaquil, when he placed fifth place in the 200-metre. He followed the '82 Worlds, by finished third and second in the 100-metre and 200-metre breaststroke at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. This, combined with the announcement of the communist countries boycotting the 1984 Summer Olympics, looked to lead to a good result in Los Angeles the following year, so after the '83 Pan Ams Restrepo went to Canada to train. Despite this, however, he failed to earn a medal at LA'84, finishing sixth place in the 200-metre. His performance (2:18.96), however, was the Colombian national record just until 2009 (the current holder is Jorge Murillo with 2:16.40). Although he announced his retirement and came back from North America, appeared again for the 1986 Central American and Caribbean Games (St. Domingo, Dominican Rep.) with a silver medal (behind the Cuban Hern√°ndez). That result, but even more his new world championship final in Spain (in 1986 too) made him to return with the idea of the Olympic medal. He got the gold in the 100 m in the South American Championships (over Brazil's Tortelli) in May 1988, but he failed to get his third Olympic final in Seoul that same year. Despite the level of Colombian swimming is not from world class, even is surprising that his Colombian national records in breast were just broken in 2009 (1:03.89 against 1:03.79 in 100 m. on April and 2:18.96 against 2:16.40 in 200m, both broken by Jorge Murillo). Today, he is dedicated to his businesses and to teaching swimming in his academy. He continues to participate in swimming competitions and, showing a great longevity, he got the silver medal in 100 m. breaststroke in the 2003 Colombia National Championships, being at least 24 years older than the winner Diego Bonilla.

The establishment of diplomatic relations between Albania and the Soviet Union happened on April 7, 1924. Both countries were also allies in the Warsaw Pact. Albania has an embassy in Moscow. Russia has an embassy in Tirana. Both countries are full members of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (Albania is a member, while Russia is an observer state), and the Council of Europe. Albania and the USSR Early Cold War= Because the Soviet Red Army never entered Albania, the Albanians liberated their own nation. Albania had developed very good relations with Yugoslavia, and especially their post-war relations were very good. =Allies= In February 1949, Albania gained membership in the communist bloc's organization for coordinating economic planning, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon). Tirana soon entered into trade agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and the Soviet Union. Soviet and East European technical advisers took up residence in Albania, and the Soviet Union also sent Albania military advisers and built a submarine installation on Sazan Island. After the Soviet-Yugoslav split, Albania and Bulgaria were the only countries the Soviet Union could use to funnel mat√©riel to the communists fighting in Greece. What little strategic value Albania offered the Soviet Union, however, gradually shrank as nuclear arms technology developed. =Rift in the Communist Bloc= During the Sino- Soviet Split, Albania supported the People's Republic of China. This isolated them from the Soviet leadership, and started the Soviet-Albanian split. After additional sharp exchanges between Soviet and Chinese delegates over Albania at the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Twenty-Second Party Congress in October 1961, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev lambasted the Albanians for executing a pregnant, pro-Soviet member of the Albanian Labor Party's Politburo, and the Soviet Union finally broke diplomatic relations with Albania in December. Moscow then withdrew all Soviet economic advisers and technicians from the country, including those at work on the Palace of Culture, and halted shipments of supplies and spare parts for equipment already in place in Albania. In addition, the Soviet Union continued to dismantle its naval installations on Sazan Island, a process that had begun even before the break in relations. =China= Communist China compensated Albania for the loss of Soviet economic support, by supplying about 90% of the parts, foodstuffs, and other goods the Soviet Union had promised. Beijing lent the Albanians money on more favorable terms than Moscow, and, unlike Soviet advisers, Chinese technicians earned the same low pay as Albanian workers and lived in similar housing. China also presented Albania with a powerful radio transmission station from which Tirana sang the praises of Joseph Stalin, Enver Hoxha, and Mao Zedong for decades. For its part, Albania offered China a beachhead in Europe and acted as Communist China's chief spokesman at the UN. To Albania's dismay, however, Chinese equipment and technicians were not nearly so sophisticated as the Soviet goods and advisers they replaced. A language barrier even forced the Chinese and Albanian technicians to communicate in Russian. Albanians no longer took part in Warsaw Pact activities or Comecon agreements. The other East European communist nations, however, did not break diplomatic or trade links with Albania. In 1964 the Albanians went so far as to seize the empty Soviet embassy in Tirana, and Albanian workers pressed on with construction of the Palace of Culture on their own. =Later developments= In October 1964, Hoxha hailed Nikita Khrushchev's fall from power, and the Soviet Union's new leaders made overtures to Tirana. It soon became clear, however, that the new Soviet leadership had no intention of changing basic policies to suit Albania, and relations failed to improve. Tirana's propaganda continued for decades to refer to Soviet officials as \\"treacherous revisionists\\" and \\"traitors to communism,\\" and in 1964 Hoxha said that Albania's terms for reconciliation were a Soviet apology to Albania and reparations for damages inflicted on the country. Soviet-Albanian relations dipped to new lows after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, when Albania responded by officially withdrawing from the alliance. Sino-Albanian relations ended by 1978. Even with the Sino-Albanian split, the Albanians refused to normalize relations with the Soviet Union, leaving their country virtually completely isolated from the outside world. Albania and the Russian Federation Embassy of Russia in Tirana Since the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence, Russia has mainly backed up Serbia. However the relations between the two countries begin to improve through the organizations they are a part of. Albania's ambassador to Russia as of November 2018 is Arben Gazioni, and Russia's ambassador to Albania is Alexander Karpushin. Within the wider Balkans Albania is considered to be the most pro-EU and pro-Western country in the region and unlike its neighbours (except Kosovo), it has little to negligible support for Russia.  Albanian community of Russia  High level visits  Hoxha flew in July 1947 to Moscow to conclude a trade agreement with the Soviet Union and engage in further negotiations with Stalin. In May 1959, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev paid a visit to Tirana in the first visit by a Russian leader to the country. The goal of the visit was to pressure Albania into building Yugoslav‚ÄìAlbanian and Soviet‚ÄìAlbanian relations as well as, according to historian Miranda Vickers, \\"focus their economy on the growing of citrus fruits rather than concentrate on industrialization\\". Khrushchev also visited the ancient southern city of Butrint, where he remarked to Soviet Defense Minister Rodion Malinovsky, \\"Look, how marvelous this is! An ideal base for our submarines could be built here. These old things [reference to archaeological findings] should be dug up and thrown into the sea\\". The visit was clouded by mutual mistrust, which resulted in his departure from the country two days ahead of schedule.

This type of tool is alternately referred to as a rock bit, or simply a bit. The hole diameter produced by drill bits is quite small, from about to , compared to the depth of the hole, which can range from to more than . Subsurface formations are broken apart mechanically by cutting elements of the bit by scraping, grinding or localized compressive fracturing. The cuttings produced by the bit are most typically removed from the wellbore and continuously returned to the surface by the method of direct circulation.  Types  Drill bits are broadly classified into two main types according to their primary cutting mechanism. Rolling cutter bits drill largely by fracturing or crushing the formation with \\"tooth\\"-shaped cutting elements on two or more cone-shaped elements that roll across the face of the borehole as the bit is rotated. Fixed cutter bits employ a set of blades with very hard cutting elements, most commonly natural or synthetic diamond, to remove material by scraping or grinding action as the bit is rotated. Modern commercial rolling cutter bits usually employ three cones to contain the cutting elements, although two cone or (rarely) four cone arrangements are sometimes seen. These bits mainly fall into two classes depending on the manufacture of the cutting elements or \\"teeth\\". Steel-tooth bits have cones that have wedge-shaped teeth milled directly in the cone steel itself. Extremely hard tungsten carbide material is often applied to the surfaces of the teeth by a welding process to improve durability. Tungsten carbide insert (TCI) bits have shaped teeth of sintered tungsten carbide press-fit into drilled holes in the cones. Some types of steel-tooth bits also have TCI elements in addition to the milled teeth. The cones rotate on roller or journal bearings that are usually sealed from the hostile down-hole drilling fluid environment by different arrangements of o-ring or metal face seals. These bits usually also have pressure compensated grease lubrication systems for the bearings. The first commercially successful rolling cutter drill bit design was disclosed in U.S. patents granted to Howard R. Hughes, Sr. on August 10, 1909, and which led to the creation of what became the Hughes Tool Company. This bit employed two conical steel rolling elements with milled teeth that engaged the formation, when the device was rotated, to produce the cutting action. This design represented a significant improvement in drilling performance over the so-called \\"fish tail\\" scraper type bits commonly used in rotary drilling at the time, and over the next two decades, rotary drilling with rolling cutter bits largely replaced all other drilling methods in the oilfield. The significance of the Hughes Two-Cone Drill Bit was recognized on its 100th anniversary when it was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Fixed cutter bits were the first type of drill bit employed in rotary drilling, and they are mechanically much simpler than rolling cutter bits. The cutting elements do not move relative to the bit; there is no need for bearings or lubrication. The most common cutting element in use today is the polycrystalline diamond cutter (PDC), a sintered tungsten carbide cylinder with one flat surface coated with a synthetic diamond material. The cutters are arranged on the blades of the bit in a staggered pattern with the diamond coated cutter surface facing the direction of bit rotation to provide full coverage of the borehole bottom. Other fixed cutter bits may employ natural industrial-grade diamonds or thermal stable polycrystalline diamond (TSP) cutting elements. There is also currently available, a hybrid type of bit that combines both rolling cutter and fixed cutter elements.  Design  Regardless of type, drill bits must satisfy two primary design goals: maximize the rate of penetration (ROP) of the formation and provide a long service life. The reason for this is a direct consequence of the rotary drilling method. Modern oilfield drilling operations require substantial capital and operating expense. It might cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to mobilize the equipment and manpower resources required for drilling to the site. Once the rig is in place, substantial daily expenses are incurred regardless of whether or not a wellbore is actually being drilled. Obviously the faster the wellbore reaches required total depth, the lower the overall cost. Additionally, if the bit fails or wears out, it must be replaced by removing the perhaps several miles of the drill pipe to which it is attached. During this time, known as a \\"trip\\", the depth of the hole is not advanced, but much of the operating costs are still incurred. For this reason, the effectiveness of a bit is often measured as drilling cost per foot of hole drilled, where a lower number indicates a higher performing bit. Note that the cost of the bit itself often is a rather small part of the overall drilling cost. Within the last couple of decades, a third design goal has become important in some cases. Many wells today are drilled using directional technology, where the wellbore is intentionally directed from vertical. For bits to be used in these situations, the ability of the bit to be more easily \\"steered\\" during drilling has become a third, possibly driving, primary goal of the design. The ability of a bit design to satisfy the two primary goals is constrained by a number of factors, most importantly the wellbore diameter. Other constraints are dictated by its intended use: formation type (hardness, plasticity, abrasiveness) to be drilled, operating environment at depth (temperature, pressure, corrosiveness), the capabilities of the equipment used in the operation (rotating speed, available weight on bit, pump horsepower) and the angle of the wellbore (vertical, directional, horizontal). Modern drill bit designs try to balance these constraints to achieve the primary goals. Most rolling cutter and fixed cutter drill bits have internal passages to direct drilling fluid, conveyed by the drill pipe from surface pumps, through hydraulic nozzles directed at the bottom of the wellbore to produce high velocity fluid jets that assist in cleaning the old cuttings off the bottom before the next tooth contacts the rock. Placement of the nozzles, particularly in rolling cutter bits, is also often done to assist in keeping the cutting elements free of cuttings build-up in certain kinds of clay and shale formations.

FEA Records Management Profile, Version 1.0. December 15, 2005. Records life-cycle in records management refers to the following stages of a records \\"life span\\": from its creation to its preservation (in an archives) or disposal. While various models of the records life-cycle exist, they all feature creation or receipt, use, and disposition. Overview The records management phase of the records life-cycle consists of creation, classification, maintenance and disposition. Creation occurs during the receipt of information in the form of records. Records or their information is classified in some logical system. As records are used they require maintenance. Disposition encompasses the destruction or transfer to an archive for future reference. This is then followed by a second, archival phase consisting of the selection or acquisition of the records by an archives, a description of the records in inventories, finding aids, and the like and the preservation of the records or, perhaps, the information in the records. Researchers and scholars may continue to reference and use of the information contained within the records. Continuum model Richard Berner of the University of Washington proposed a single records management-archives goal: \\"responsible records use and administration leading to either authorized destruction or archival preservation and administration.\\" The professions of records management and archives, while distinct, surely are working towards the same objective: the effective management of recorded information through all stages of the continuum, from creation to disposal. Effective management of recorded information (what Berner calls \\"responsible records use and administration\\") requires ongoing cooperative interaction between the records manager and the archivist in order to: * ensure the creation of the right records, containing the right information, in the right format; * organize the records and analyze their content and significance to facilitate their availability; * make them available promptly to those (administrators and researchers alike) who have a right and a requirement to see them; * systematically dispose of records that are no longer required; and * protect and preserve the information for as long as it may be needed (if necessary, forever). Important later contributions were made by Frank Upward and his development of the Records Continuum Model.

Burke) Cover art by Patricia Cullen Mission to Mars is a 1955 children's science fiction novel by Patrick Moore, published by Burke. It is the first of the six-book Maurice Gray series. The action is set initially on Earth and then on Mars. The time is 1968, two years after the first landing on the Moon. Plot synopsis Maurice Gray, a young recently orphaned Englishman, arrives at the Woomera Rocket base in Australia to meet his only known relative, Dr Leslie Yorke, a scientist at the base. He learns from Bruce Talbot, a radar technician, that Dr. Yorke is presently on an expedition to Mars in the Hermes. Listening to the base radio, Maurice hears a fragmentary message from the expedition in morse code. The expedition report that their ship has landed, but has been damaged and is inoperable. They have limited supplies of air. Because of his light weight and his knowledge of radio-transmission, Sir Robert Lanner, the Chief Controller, is persuaded to allow Maurice to join a rescue mission with Bruce and Dr David Mellor aboard the nuclear-powered ship Ares. The journey is uneventful except for a spacewalk that goes wrong; Maurice rescues Bruce when the latter loses his safety line. This rescue binds the crew closer together. During the landing, they pass through the so-called 'Violet Layer', a portion of the Martian atmosphere, which severely buffets them. They land, but their radar systems are damaged beyond repair. They discover that the Layer contains a powerful magnetic field, which also probably damaged the Hermes. Exploring Mars on foot, Maurice and Bruce are nearly frozen in the cold of night when a dust-storm delays them and injures Bruce. They make fragmentary contact with Yorke, who reports a few hours worth of air. They set out to rescue the others. On the journey, they encounter carnivorous gastropods and pterodactyl-like flying creatures. They witness an attack by one of the gastropods on one of the flying creatures and are able to rescue the latter, nicknaming it \\"Horace\\". Unable to find the Hermes, they are guided to the ship by \\"Horace\\" and several others, who exhibit signs of intelligence. Yorke, Whitton and Knight are found, running critically short of air. They cannibalise the Hermes, especially the undamaged radar systems, and return to the Ares. Despite the extra weight, they manage to take off and return to Earth. A fossil collected by one of the expedition members is examined and speculated to have been part of a winged intelligent humanoid - maybe one of the remote ancestors of \\"Horace\\". Maurice, now fascinated by Mars, is invited to join the staff at Woomera.

Construction of the wind farm took place between 2005 and 2006. The farm is operated by Barrow Offshore Wind Limited, owned by √òrsted A/S. Planning and design Barrow wind farm was a UK Round 1 wind farm development originally developed by Warwick Energy Limited.Barrow (4C Offshore) Developers/Owners/Operators A planning application was submitted in 2001,Barrow Offshore Wind Farm (LORC) Timeline & Track Records and planning consent given in March 2003; the project was sold to Centrica (25%, c.¬£22.5million), √òrsted A/S (then named DONG Energy) (37.5%), and Statkraft (37.5%) in Sep. 2003. The estimated cost of developing the project was ¬£100million, of which ¬£10million was provided by a UK government grant. In 2004 Centrica and √òrsted bought the Statkraft stake, forming a 50:50 joint venture in the development. The initial Warwick Energy proposal was for a 30 turbine wind farm 7 km southwest of Walney Island (Cumbria), with a generating capacity of up to 108MW; electrical power supply to the mainland was to be via a ~25 km long 132kV cable making groundfall near Heysham, with connection to the mainland electrical grid at an extension to an existing electricity substation south of Heysham nuclear power station.Barrow wind farm (Non technical summary) (Warwick Energy) pp.1‚Äì2 Turbines were expected to have ~50m radius blades, with a 75m hub height, and be situated in water at a depth of ~20m, with a ~32.5m sub-sea bed monopile foundation; the turbines were to be spaced approximately 500m apart in four rows aligned to face the prevailing southwesterly winds, with a row spacing of ~750m.Barrow wind farm (Non technical summary) (Warwick Energy) pp.2‚Äì3 Construction jackup ship and wind turbine in background (2006) In July 2004 Kellogg Brown & Root Ltd and Vestas-Celtic Wind Technology Ltd were awarded the contract to install and commission the wind farm, and to operate the wind farm for 5 years. A 30 turbine wind farm with a capacity of 90MW was constructed by the consortium between July 2005 and May 2006. The main construction base was at Harland and Wolff's shipyard in Belfast. In exceptions where pile driving of monopile foundations failed, drilling was used to form the monopile foundations. IEC 1A class Vestas V90-3.0MW wind turbines were used, mounted on a 75m tower connected to monopiles supplied by a Sif/Smulders joint venture.Barrow Offshore Wind Farm (LORC) Turbine, Tower & Substructure Turbine to offshore substation electric connection were at 33kV, with the voltage stepped up to 132kV at an offshore substation supplied by Areva T&D; (transformer), Sif/Smulders (superstructure and monopile) and designed by KBR and Mott MacDonald.

Distribution Physocarpus monogynus occurs from northern Mexico and west Texas north to Montana and South Dakota and west to Nevada (Elmore 1976, USDA 2008). It grows on slopes, shaded by being in canyons or facing north, at altitudes of 1,700 to 3,000 meters (5,500 to 10,000 feet). The typical habitat, at least in the southern part of its range, is dominated by ponderosa pine and scrub oak (Elmore 1976). Description Main stem with peeling bark The Physocarpus monogynus plant reaches 1.2 meters (4 feet) in height and somewhat more in width. The leaves are dull green above and paler below, with 3 to 5 doubly toothed lobes, so they suggest big currant (Ribes) leaves. The bark is brownish and shreds, revealing many layers, hence the name \\"ninebark\\" (Elmore 1976). In May or June, mountain ninebark bears \\"rather lovely\\" white or rose-colored flowers, with five petals based in a cup-like structure. The flowers have one style, the meaning of \\"monogynus\\" (literally \\"one female part\\"). They turn red-brown and stay on the plant into the winter. The seed pods are inflated and covered with white hairs (Elmore 1976). The seeds are bean-shaped, about 2 mm long, bright shiny yellowish (USDA 2008). Uses Indians made a pain-relieving poultice by boiling the roots and placing them on the site while still warm.

Between 2009 and 2010 the area of the site was reduced to the north increase clearance from the shipping lanes to the Port of Liverpool; to the south and to the west, reducing potential impact on recreational sailing activities and on certain species of sea bird, and due to potential conflicts with ship anchoring sites; also reducing the visual impact from land. In April 2010 the Crown Estate awarded an area of for lease.(5.1.1.5) Site Selection and Alternatives (Dong) sec.5.3.3-5.3.14, fig.5.1, 5.2 Water depths in the area are between . The sea bed consisted primarily of sand. The underlying geology is sand overlaying clay overlaying mudstone. Samples within the turbine area showed sand followed by clay down to around 30m before weak mudstone was found. The initial cable export route and grid connection identified was one making landfall near to the existing Burbo Bank land connection, and connected to a 275 kV substation in Birkenhead; subsequently a potential grid connection at the 400 kV Deeside substation (near Deeside Power Station, Wales) was identified; and later a connection with landfall at Ffrith Beach, (nr.

Rossum is serving a life sentence in the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla. Background Kristin Rossum grew up in Claremont, California, the oldest child of Ralph and Constance Rossum. Her father is a professor at Claremont McKenna College and her mother worked at Azusa Pacific University. She has two brothers. In 1991, after Rossum's father accepted the position of President of Hampden‚ÄìSydney College, the family moved to Virginia and Kristin enrolled at the all-girls St. Catherine's School in Richmond. There, Rossum began drinking beer and smoking cigarettes. She also tried marijuana, but said it had little effect. Starting in 1992, she began using methamphetamine. In 1994, Rossum moved back to California and enrolled part-time at the University of Redlands and moved into a dormitory on campus, but eventually left following a relapse. After overcoming her addiction and beginning her relationship with Greg de Villers, Rossum enrolled at San Diego State University and graduated with honors in 1998. After graduating, she worked as a toxicologist at the San Diego County medical examiner's office. Rossum and de Villers married in 1999. The following year, she began an extramarital affair with her boss, Dr. Michael Robertson. Murder In late 2000, de Villers had learned about both the affair and her resumption of her meth habit, threatening to expose both to the medical examiner if she did not quit her job. Robertson, who also knew Rossum had relapsed, learned of this threat before de Villers was killed. On November 6, 2000, just after 9:15 p.m., Rossum dialled 9-1-1 and reported that de Villers had committed suicide. Paramedics found him laying unresponsive on the couple's bed, which was sprinkled with red rose petals; he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. His wife told authorities he committed suicide. Despite her claims, de Villers' family - particularly his brother Jerome - were adamant that he was not suicidal. However, San Diego police were initially reluctant to open an investigation. A month after de Villers' death, Rossum and Robertson were both fired from the medical examiner's office ‚Äì Rossum for hiding her meth habit, and Robertson for hiding his knowledge of her habit and their affair. Due to potential conflicts of interest, the San Diego medical examiner outsourced de Villers' autopsy to an outside lab in Los Angeles. The tests showed de Villers had seven times the lethal dose of fentanyl in his system. Under questioning, Rossum told detectives that her husband had been depressed before he died, while her father stated that he seemed to be deeply distressed and that he drank heavily on the night he died. As the investigation continued, police learned about Rossum's relapse, and about a phone call she made to de Villers' employers telling them he would not be coming in to work the day of his murder.\\"The Rose Petal Murder\\". Crime Library Trial and conviction On June 25, 2001, seven months after de Villers' death, Rossum was arrested and charged with murder. On January 4, 2002, her parents posted her $1.25 million bail. At trial, the prosecution contended that Rossum murdered her husband to keep him from telling her bosses about both her affair and her use of meth stolen from the drug lab. Defense attorneys argued that de Villers was suicidal and poisoned himself. Rossum's brother-in-law, Jerome de Villers, testified that it was difficult to believe his brother had committed suicide because he hated drugs. The 9-1-1 tape played in court appeared to indicate Rossum was administering CPR to her husband. According to her Vons card history, she had purchased the rose used to stage de Villers' body, which prosecutors claimed was copied from a scene in the 1999 film American Beauty. On November 12, 2002, Rossum was found guilty of first degree murder. On December 12, she was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility for parole, and a $10,000 fine. She was transferred to the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla, the largest women's correctional facility in the U.S. Recent events In 2006, both Rossum and San Diego County were named as defendants in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by de Villers' family. A jury ordered Rossum to pay more than $100 million in punitive damages, while San Diego County was ordered to pay $1.5 million. The family had originally asked for $50 million in punitive damages, but jurors awarded double that amount after estimating Rossum could have made $60 million from selling the rights to her story.Millions of Dollars Awarded to Family of Man Killed by Toxicologist Wife . North County Times, 2006-03-21. John Gomez, the lawyer for the de Villers family, acknowledged that the family may never see the money, but wanted to make sure Rossum does not profit from her crime.\\"Rossum unlikely to turn lurid crime tale into riches\\". SignOnSanDiego.com A judge later reduced the punitive damages award to $10 million, but allowed the $4.5 million compensatory award to stand.\\"Judge cuts $90 million from Rossum murder verdict\\" SignOnSanDiego.com In September 2010, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Rossum's lawyers should have challenged the prosecution's assertion, by doing its own tests, that she poisoned her husband with fentanyl. The panel ordered a San Diego federal court to hold a hearing into whether the defense's error could have affected the trial's outcome.\\"Kristin Rossum's murder conviction appeal revived\\" SignOnSanDiego.com On September 13, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals withdrew its opinion and replaced it with a one-paragraph statement that under a new Supreme Court precedent, Rossum's petition was denied. Following his termination by the San Diego medical examiner's office, Robertson returned to his home in Brisbane, Australia, ostensibly to care for his ailing mother. In September 2013, the San Diego Reader reported that, in 2006, prosecutors secretly filed a criminal complaint charging Robertson - who was named as an unindicted co-conspirator at Rossum's trial - with one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice. If the Australian government elects to extradite Robertson or he voluntarily returns to the US, he could face up to three years in prison.Rother, Caitlin. Arrest warrant issued for Kristin Rossum‚Äôs Australian lover. San Diego Reader, 2013-09-18. As of 2014, Robertson is running a forensic consulting service in Brisbane.

The band was formed in Asheville, North Carolina in November 2002. Ahleuchatistas' sound is rooted in a wide variety of sonic influences and musical traditions. In addition to being an instrumental rock band, there are elements of noise, African music, ambient/drone, psychedelia, Chinese traditional music, garage rock, minimalism, classical music, and electronica. They employ block-form, thru-composition, and improvisational musical strategies. Sudden tempo changes, amelodic tones, and technically complex motifs are prominent characteristics of much of the band's recorded output. The original members of the band were Shane Perlowin on guitar, Derek Poteat on bass, and Sean Dail on drums. Sean Dail left the band in May 2008 and was replaced by Ryan Oslance, a drummer from Carbondale, Illinois. Ryan was found by a reply to a MySpace bulletin outlining the band's request for a new drummer. He then drove to Asheville, auditioned, and the band immediately rehearsed for 25+ hours over a four-day period. This was followed by a 3-week US tour. Ahleuchatistas have released six albums on different record labels, including Cuneiform Records, Angura Sound, Tzadik Records, and guitarist Shane Perlowin's independent label Open Letter Records.

She is a member of the titular club, along with her friends Lena Kaligaris, Bridget Vreeland and Carmen Lowell. She was portrayed by Amber Tamblyn in the film. Family Tibby's parents are described as former hippies. She was born when they were 19, and she apparently spent much of her early life swept up in their various adventures; her father was, at turns, a writer for a socialist newspaper, a public defender, and an organic farmer, while her mother was a sculptor. Eventually, her mother became a real estate agent and her father became a corporate lawyer. They settled down in a suburban house with Tibby and her two younger siblings, Nicky and Katherine, who are respectively thirteen and fourteen years younger than her. Tibby often feels like an outcast in her own family, viewing herself as a leftover of her parents' former life. As a result, she resents her younger siblings and tries to distance herself from them during the first two novels. Friends Tibby's best friends are Lena Kaligaris, Carmen Lowell, and Bridget Vreeland. She has known them all since birth. She also befriends Bailey Graffman and has a guinea pig Mimi who both die at the end of the first novel. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants Stuck at home in Bethesda, Maryland while her three friends went to Greece, Mexico and South Carolina, she decides to make a \\"suckumentary\\" about people she considers to be \\"lame,\\" among them her coworkers at Wallman's and Brian McBrian, a fellow high schooler who spends most of his time playing Dragon Master at the local 7-Eleven. At Wallman's, Tibby meets twelve-year-old Bailey Graffman, who is dying of leukemia and is eager to help Tibby with her movie. Bailey, afraid of not having enough time to truly understand people and, in turn, be understood, looks beyond appearances and finds the true worth in each of Tibby's documentary subjects, allowing Tibby to do the same. Bailey dies at the end of the novel and Tibby decided to make the documentary about the summer she had with Bailey. The Second Summer of the Sisterhood Tibby takes a course in filmmaking at Williamston College. She tries desperately to impress Alex and Maura, two of her classmates. In the process, she ends up shunning Brian (who has become one of her closest friends since the end of the first novel) when he visits her and makes a video which upsets her mother. In the end, she realises that Brian is her true friend, and Alex and Maura are phony. She makes a touching video about Bailey, and Brian and her mother forgive her. Girls in Pants: The Third Summer of the Sisterhood Brian asks Tibby to the senior dance at their high school, and she says yes. After the dance, at a picnic table, they exchange their first kiss, and Brian reveals his feelings for her. The next morning while thinking about Brian, Tibby forgets that her younger sister has been trying to get an apple from a tree outside her window. She opens the window, and her sister accidentally falls out. Tibby becomes depressed and blames herself, so she avoids Brian. Eventually, though, she comes to terms with her problems. Tibby ends up helping deliver Carmen's half-brother, Ryan and becomes his godmother. After that, she finds Brian, and together, they strip off their clothes and jump into the city pool, marking their start as a couple. Forever in Blue: The Fourth Summer of the Sisterhood Brian, Tibby's now long-term boyfriend, visits her and announces that he's been admitted to NYU, where she studies. Afterwards, they get drunk and have sex for the very first time. They discover that the condom broke, leading Tibby to suspect that she may be pregnant. Although she later finds out that she is not, she breaks up with Brian. Lena's younger sister, Effie, then seeks her out and asks her permission to go out with Brian. Tibby begins to doubt her decision to break up with Brian and becomes terribly upset. Lena then goes to Tibby's house to comfort her. They talk about their relationships and both come to a revelation, that they only fall in love once. Tibby meets Brian at the site of their first kiss, the picnic table, and apologizes for letting her fear ruin their relationship. They enter a new stage in their romance. This results in Effie taking the pants out of anger, and accidentally losing them in Greece. Sisterhood Everlasting Ten years following the last sisterhood book, Tibby has moved to Australia with Brian and now has almost no contact with the three other girls. Soon after moving to Australia, Tibby learns that she is not only pregnant but she is also diagnosed with a terminal disease. She keeps the pregnancy a secret from the sisterhood and her family, as revealing it will also reveal the disease. Nearly two years after giving birth to her daughter, Bailey, she calls her \\"sisters\\" together for one last trip to Greece. Disaster strikes when she suddenly dies in a swimming accident on the shores in Greece leaving her sisters, Lena, Bridget, and Carmen, devastated and assuming that she had taken her own life. It is revealed through the novel that Tibby was suffering from Huntington's disease and aware that she was going to die, even though her death by drowning was an accident. When she invited the girls to Greece she was going to reveal this and give them letters to help them move on. It is later revealed that she discovered she had the disease when she found she was pregnant with her daughter Bailey. Her final gift to Lena, Carmen, and Bridget is willing them to move on because life is too short. Other references In 3 Willows Tibby is alive, attending NYU and dating Brian. In 3 Willows, Polly babysits Tibby's little brother and sister. Polly sees a picture of Bailey which Tibby keeps in her bedroom.

Described by Miles Kington as 'the funniest man who wrote for Punch since the war', Frater is best known for his various books and for documentaries he wrote and produced for the BBC and ABC. Early life Frater was born in a small mission hospital in Port Vila, Vanuatu in the middle of a monsoon. His father Alec, a doctor, would later teach him how to observe and analyse weather.Datta, 2018 Frater's family employed the services of a native gardener, Moses, who believed the young Alexander was the reincarnation of a rain God. A few weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the family evacuated to Australia to escape the coming war. In 1946 they moved to Suva, Fiji, where Frater Sr. became Professor at the Central Medical School. After primary school Frater was sent back to Australia to attend Scotch College in Melbourne, where he edited the school magazine and, as head boy, succeeded in his campaign to abolish corporal punishment. Initially studying law at the University of Melbourne, he left before graduating to move to England, and studied English at Durham University (Hatfield College). From 1960-1962 Frater competed for Durham University Boat Club. He also represented the Hatfield College Boat Club in intercollegiate events ‚Äì where one of his fellow club members was classicist R. M. Errington ‚Äì and served as Captain of the Hatfield College Swimming Club in 1961.Ibid , p. 60Ibid , p. 264 He would stumble into a career in journalism by accident. Having submitted pieces to Punch while still an undergraduate at Durham he was, against all expectations, eventually offered a staff job, which prompted him to once again leave university without graduating. Frater would later enroll at Perugia University to briefly study Italian, before again dropping out, meaning that he had attended three universities without graduating from any of them ‚Äì an 'unusual feat' of which he was proud. While in Italy he met his wife, Marlis Pfund, who worked as an air hostess for Swissair. CareerPunch= Before making his living through writing Frater had romanticised about joining the Colonial Service, but the process of decolonization, culminating in the end of the Colonial Office altogether, ended this notion. Frater's tenure at Punch saw him develop a friendly rivalry with a young Alan Coren, later to find fame as a humourist and participant on The News Quiz. But it also coincided with the magazine's period of starkest decline, which he attributed to both the Satire boom (which left Punch looking old-fashioned) and the decline of the British Empire ‚Äì the magazine being popular in the Colonies. =Interim= Looking to move on, he soon became a contracted writer for The New Yorker. During his time writing for The New Yorker he produced a number of stories about an idyllic, imaginary Pacific island he called Tofua. Later he was informed by a fact-checker that such an island really existed in Tonga, which went on to form the basis for a book published many years later, Tales from the Torrid Zone. Following his time with The New Yorker he spent one year as a staff writer for The Daily Telegraph from 1966‚Äì1967, working on its supplemental magazine. John Anstey, the magazine's editor, did not like 'Russ', the name which Frater was then known by and demanded he use his first name for his byline (his family had a tradition of calling members by their second names). Friends from earlier periods would continue to call him 'Russ', as did those he met after leaving Fleet Street. =The Observer= Frater moved to The Observer in 1967, where he would spend more than two decades, become travel editor and amass a series of awards. He was twice commended in the British Press Awards, and in 1990 won Travel Writer of the Year. Frater took a short break from journalism to write Beyond the Blue Horizon (1984). He attempted to recreate the journey made in the Imperial Airways 'Eastbound Empire' service - the world's longest and most adventurous scheduled air route. Chasing the Monsoon (1990) sees Frater follow the Monsoon in India. As a child his curiosity about India, and particularly its monsoon season, was sparked by his father - who often told stories about the country. In the course of this journey following the Monsoon he visited the city of Deeg, having driven for five-hours from New Delhi, but was disappointed to find the city largely lifeless and the watercourses all empty. Chasing the Monsoon would turn out to be Frater's most popular book, particularly in India, where, by 2016, it still sold hundreds of copies a month. Frater visited North Korea in the 1990s under the guise of being a teacher ‚Äì journalists not being allowed in. He stayed at the Koryo Hotel, where he was one of only 20 guests despite the building having 45 floors. In 2008 he published his final book, The Balloon Factory. It focuses on the pioneers of aviation-based at The Balloon Factory in Farnborough. Television Frater made several television documentaries. A BBC and ABC Discovery Series documentary recreating Africa's flying boat journeys from Cairo to Mozambique was filmed in difficult conditions in 1989 aboard a Catalina flying boat. The programme aired in 1990 entitled The Last African Flying Boat. Monsoon (BBC), about India's monsoonal rainfall event, aired in 1991. In the Footsteps of Buddha (BBC), 1993. Personal Frater had 2 children: Tania, a university administrator, and John, a medical professor at the University of Oxford. He lived in Richmond upon Thames, close to Heathrow Airport, but unlike many residents did not mind being under 'the glide path' and was curious about the details of the aircraft passing above his flat. In a 2004 interview with The Independent Frater named his worst travel experience as being arrested in Kupang, West Timor by the Indonesian Military and spending three days in prison, in a cell neighbouring a pit with two Komodo dragons. After release he was put under house arrest and then thrown off the island. Death Frater died on 1 January 2020 at Australian rugby union player, two days before his 83rd birthday and several years after suffering a stroke. Books * Frater, A.R. 2008.

(31 March 2010) In parts of the Northern Hemisphere, an April shower is rain during the month of April. One of the major causes of the often heavy downpours is the position of the jet stream. In early spring, the jet stream starts to move northwards, allowing large depressions to bring strong winds and rain in from the Atlantic. In one day the weather can change from springtime sunshine to winter sleet and snow. The track of these depressions can often be across Ireland and Scotland bringing bands of rain followed by heavy showers (often of hail or snow) and strong blustery winds. The proverb \\"March winds and April showers bring forth May flowers\\", first recorded in 1886, and the shorter, trochaic version \\"April showers bring May flowers\\" (originally \\"Sweet April showers/Do spring May flowers\\", part of a poem recorded in 1610Northall, G.

He has also written articles for Fine Art Connoisseur, Quillette, American Art Collector, Artists on Art, Combustus and Postmodern Times. His piece about the artist Dino Valls is the most read article on the Combustus website. Academic life He is Professor of Figurative Drawing and Painting at California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, California. In 2010 he introduced an atelier-style system to the CLU Art Department, in which each faculty member was provided with their own studio space on campus, welcoming their students to study alongside them as they lead by example in the production of their own work. He served as Chair of the Art Department between 2008 - 2013. Between 2005 - 2016 Pearce was curator of CLU's Kwan Fong Gallery where his programming emphasized the work of representational artists and interdisciplinary exhibits. In December 2014 the California Art Club named Pearce \\"man of the year\\" and presented him with the William & Julia Bracken Wendt Award for his service to representational art. He is a graduate of Dartington College of Arts, 1990, Ba (Hons) Theatre; The University of Southern California, 1992 MFA Theatrical Design; and Plymouth University, 2008, PhD Using Prehistoric British Art and Architecture as a Model for Contemporary Art. The Representational Art Conference By 2012 his enthusiasm for skill-based studio technique led to collaboration with his friend Michael Lynn Adams to organize The Representational Art Conference, which examined the role of representational art in the 21st Century, seeking to address a \\"neglect of critical appreciation of representational art well out of proportion to its quality and significance\\". The conference was planned as a focused but non-doctrinaire event, of serious academic standards. Pearce described the reason for producing the conference: \\"Until we did TRAC, there were literally no conferences at all about representational art - which is a strange absence, because there was then and is now a huge amount of representational art, and a very large community of people who are interested in representational art. It seemed like a big gap that needed filling.\\" At TRAC2012 Jed Perl and John Nava were keynote speakers, while major figures in the American Representational Art scene gave presentations and demonstrations, including former USC Dean of Art Ruth Weisberg, artists Tony Pro, David Kassan, Graydon Parrish, Jeremy Lipking, Sadie Valeri, Richard T. Scott, Alexey Steele, Art Historian Vern Swanson and author Virgil Elliot. In Art LTD magazine John Seed described the event as \\"a 149-year-later 'Salon Des Refuses'\\". Pearce edited the papers from the 2012 conference in a volume published in 2013 as \\"The Real Snake: Proceedings of the Representational Art Conference 2012\\". By 2014 The Representational Art Conference almost tripled in size and included keynote addresses by Roger Scruton and Juliette Aristides. The artist Odd Nerdrum served on a panel with Roger Scruton to discuss the aesthetics of contemporary representational art. In his Huffington Post review John Seed said \\"...a genuine movement is taking shape\\".John Seed, When Art Worlds Don't Collide. Huffington Post, 03/07/2014 Pearce edited the papers from the 2014 conference in a volume published in 2015 as \\"Kitsch & Beauty: Proceedings of the Representational Art Conference 2014\\". Pearce chaired a third installment of The Representational Art Conference which took place November 1‚Äì4, 2015 in Ventura, CA.http://trac2015.org/home/ with keynote speeches by Boston Museum of Fine Art curator Elliot Davis, Fred Ross of the Art Renewal Center, neuroscientist Semir Zeki and sculptor Richard MacDonald. Artist F. Scott Hess described some his experiences of the event in a Huffington Post article titled \\"Art That Hurts\\".F. Scott Hess, \\"\\"Art that Hurts\\"\\". Huffington Post, 11/09/2015. Selections of the conference papers, again edited by Pearce, were published as \\"As It Is: Proceedings of the Representational Art Conference 2015\\" The fourth TRAC was held in 2017 in Miami, Florida, in association with the Figurative Art Convention and Exposition (FACE) organized by Fine Art Connoisseur magazine. It featured addresses by philosopher Stephen Hicks, editor Peter Trippi, and art commentator Joseph Bravo. In 2018 TRAC became an international event, taking place in the World Trade Center, Leeuwarden, Netherlands, Europe's 2018 City of Culture. Hosted by Sir Tom Hageman of the Classical Academy, Pearce was keynote speaker, alongside Rembrandt expert Ernst van de Wettering, painter Odd Nerdrum, education expert Mandy Theis of the Da Vinci Initiative, and author Corinna Wagner. Plans were laid for TRAC to return to California in 2019. The sixth TRAC was held in Ventura, California, in Spring 2019, under the header \\"Imagine.\\" Keynote addresses came from the artist Roger Dean, famed for his paintings and album cover designs which were used in the movie \\"Avatar;\\" Dr. Corinna Wagner spoke again, this time about the imagined body; the Chinese-American painter Z. S. Liang, who paints imagery from the old west, described his work and its place in American art. Tim Jenison spoke about his research into Vermeer. As part of the conference, Pearce organized an exhibit of imaginative realism titled \\"The Illusionists,\\" featuring paintings and sculptures by Julie Bell, Roger Dean, Kathiucia Dias, Mark Gleason, F. Scott Hess, Regina Jacobson, Guy Kinnear, Brad Kunkle, Bryan Larsen, Richard MacDonald, Mark Poole, Vince Natale, Boris Vallejo, Pamela Wilson, and Sandra Yagi. A video was produced placing imaginative realism into its historical context. Theatrical design Pearce worked in Southern Californian theatre as a scenic and lighting designer, winning a 1992 Drama-Logue Award for his lighting of Brian Friel's Translations at the Celtic Arts Center, Los Angeles, and an Independent Theatre Award for his set and lighting designs for a Santa Barbara, CA production of Frankenstein in 2004. He was a member of Santa Barbara‚Äôs experimental Lit Moon Theatre Company,Lit Moon Theatre Company Website. Cited August 5th 2008. as the company's lighting designer for their award winning production of Hamlet. In 1992 he designed the set for comedian and raconteur Steve Allen‚Äôs production of his play ‚ÄúThe Wake‚Äù at the Celtic Arts Center in Hollywood, Los Angeles; Los Angeles Times reviewer Tim McCulloh said \\"Pearce's set and lighting are exemplary, giving the feeling one could walk into the Scanlon apartment and live there\\".L.A.Times.

While working on the set for the Wake he also was busy with the set design for Be Bop a Lula, a rock and roll play about Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran, produced by Adam Ant and John Densmore of The Doors, starring Donal Logue. Portraits Pearce developed a curious relationship with the aviator Amelia Earhart who appeared as the subject of several alchemical paintings. He believes that Earhart perfectly represents the element of air \\"as a modern Icarus\\"Alchemy Journal Volume 10 No. 1. Northern Spring 2009. ISSN 1836-1587 and he has painted her as an angelic character and alchemical queen. In these roles Earhart acts to transform other characters in Pearce's romantic allegorical narratives. Pearce has painted portraits for artists and musicians including actor Shane Brolly, members of the band Plexi, Skinny Puppy singer Nivek Ogre, Snoop Dogg and the No Limit Records rappers C-Murder, Silk the Shocker and Master P.

He also made two appearances for England in 1913 and 1914. He was killed at the Battle of Passchendaele in World War I. Playing career Latheron was born at Carlin How, near Middlesbrough and after playing for South Bank Corinthians he joined Grangetown Athletic, playing in the Northern League. He was discovered by Blackburn Rovers in 1906 playing for Grangetown against Blackburn Crosshill in an FA Amateur Cup tie. Rovers had originally gone to watch another player but it was Latheron who caught their eye and Rovers' manager Robert Middleton paid ¬£25 to bring him to Ewood Park. Despite his lack of height, he was masterful in the air and possessed excellent ball control and a fine shot. A prolific goal scorer, but unselfish team player, he quickly established himself as a fan's favourite and, due to his complexion and red hair, Latheron was known affectionately as \\"Pinkie\\" on the terraces. Latheron soon became a regular selection at inside-left and in 1907‚Äì08 he was joint top scorer with nine goals from 27 appearances as Rovers struggled, finishing in 14th place in the table. The following season, Middleton appointed Bob Holmes, the former Preston North End star as trainer. This appointment had a great impact on the team as they obtain fourth place in the table, with Latheron scoring ten goals. Blackburn continued their good form the following season and by October 1909 they became leaders of the First Division. They lost their position in January 1910 and finally finished in third place behind Aston Villa and Liverpool with Latheron again scoring ten goals. In 1910‚Äì11, Blackburn struggled away from home, with only one win, and, although they won 12 games at home, they could only finish in mid-table. They did, however, have a good run in the FA Cup, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals where they went down 3‚Äì0 to eventual winners Bradford City; Latheron scored three goals in the cup run, including two against Southend United in the first round. The 1911‚Äì12 season began badly with Blackburn Rovers losing two of the first three games. Blackburn's form gradually improved and the team went on an unbeaten run that lasted three months, which took them to the top of the league. Despite being defeated by Bolton Wanderers and Arsenal, Blackburn went on another good run and by the end of the season they had three more points than main challengers, Everton. This was Blackburn's first Football League title. Despite missing a substantial part of the season through injury, Latheron was one of the stars of the team, contributing seven goals, including vital goals against Everton and Oldham Athletic in the final weeks of the season. Blackburn started the 1912‚Äì13 season very well and were undefeated until December, but there then came a run of five successive defeats. In an attempt to regain the championship, Middleton broke the British transfer record by buying Danny Shea from West Ham United for ¬£2,000. Shea's twelve goals were not enough and Blackburn finished fifth that season, with Latheron the club's top scorer on 14. His form earned him a call up to the England team for the British Home Championship match against Wales played at Ashton Gate, Bristol on 17 March 1913, when he was joined by his Rovers teammates, Bob Crompton, Joseph Hodkinson and Billy Bradshaw. Latheron scored England's second goal in a 4‚Äì3 victory. His second international appearance came at Ayresome Park, Middlesbrough the following February, in a 3‚Äì0 defeat by Ireland with two goals from Liverpool's Bill Lacey as Ireland claimed the British Home Championship outright for the first time. In the league, Rovers took the Football League title for the second time in 1913‚Äì14 with a seven-point margin over Aston Villa, thanks in no small part to Danny Shea's 27 goals with Latheron contributing 13. Despite the outbreak of the First World War, league football continued in England for a further season, and in 1914‚Äì15, Blackburn finished in third place behind Everton and Oldham Athletic. Rovers scored 83 league goals in the season, with top scorer Percy Dawson on 20 goals, with Latheron scoring 17. In his nine league seasons at Ewood Park, Latheron played 258 games, scoring 94 goals. For the 1915‚Äì16 season, Latheron was one of several Blackburn Rovers players who guested for Blackpool, for whom he was top scorer with 16 goals in wartime leagues. Latheron returned to Blackburn for the 1916‚Äì17 season and played his final game for Blackburn Rovers on 17 March 1917. Including wartime matches, Latheron made a total of 303 appearances for Blackburn, scoring 120 goals. He remains the 4th highest scorer in Blackburn Rovers' history. Death and memorial After the cessation of League football, Latheron enlisted, joining the Royal Field Artillery as a gunner, and within a week of his last match for Blackburn Rovers, he was on the Front. He was killed on 14 October 1917, aged 29 at the Battle of Passchendaele, and was buried in the military cemetery at Vlamertinghe near to the town of Ypres, Belgium. He left behind a widow, Bertha, and a son, Walter. After Latheron's death, the Liverpool Echo received a letter from Alex McPhie, a former teammate of Latheron who was also fighting on the Western Front. He wrote: In October 2007, a group of Belgian fans of Blackburn Rovers honoured the 90th anniversary of Latheron's death by a ceremony at his grave.

Additionally, another very common type of aleatory contract is an insurance policy.Thomson-Gale Encyclopedia of American Law, courtesy of JrankBlack's Law Dictionary, 7th ed. 1999 The term was a classification developed in later medieval Roman law to cover all contracts whose fulfilment depended on chance, including gambling, insurance, speculative investment and life annuities.J. Franklin, The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), ch. 11. Many modern forms of derivatives and options may in some cases also be considered aleatory contracts.

After bomb damage stopped it from diving, the IXD U-boat was sunk with all hands in the Atlantic. The Gruppe Monsun or Monsoon Group was a force of German U-boats (submarines) that operated in the Pacific and Indian Oceans during World War II. Although similar naming conventions were used for temporary groupings of submarines in the Atlantic, the longer duration of Indian Ocean patrols caused the name to be permanently associated with the relatively small number of U-boats operating out of Penang (primarily its capital, George Town).Paterson Lawrence(2004), Hitler's Grey Wolves: U-boats in the Indian Ocean, p. 29 After 1944, the U-boats of the Monsun Gruppe were operationally placed under the authority of the Southeast Asia U-boat Region. The Indian Ocean was the only place where German and Japanese forces fought in the same theatre. To avoid incidents between Germans and Japanese, attacks on other submarines were strictly forbidden.Paterson Lawrence (2006), Hitler's Grey Wolves: U-boats in the Indian Ocean Altogether 41 U-boats of all types including transports would be sent; a large number of these, however, were lost and only a small fraction returned to Europe.Fate of the Far Eastern BoatsMonsun boats Evacuation Indian Ocean trade routes The Indian Ocean was considered strategically important, containing India, and the shipping routes and strategic raw materials that the British needed for the war effort. In the early years of the war German merchant raiders and pocket battleships had sunk a number of merchant ships in the Indian Ocean; however as the war progressed it became more difficult for them to operate in the area and by 1942 most were either sunk or dispersed. From 1941, U-boats were also considered for deployment to this area but due to the successful periods known as the First and Second Happy Times, it was decided that sending U-boats to the Indian Ocean would be an unnecessary diversion. There were also no foreign bases in which units could operate from and be resupplied, hence they would be operating at the limits of their range. As a result, the Germans concentrated primarily on their U-boat campaign in the North Atlantic. Japan's entry into the war in 1941 led to the capture of European South-east Asian colonies such as British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. In May and June 1942, Japanese submarines began operating in the Indian Ocean and had engaged British forces in Madagascar. The British had invaded the Vichy-controlled island in order to prevent it from falling into Japanese hands ‚Äì however, as Japan was never known (from post-war evaluation) to have had plans to place Madagascar within its own sphere of influence, Britain's defense of the island could also have been surmised to have been a plausible defense against any possibility of Madagascar falling under Germany's own ambitions. Axis strategic raw materials UIT-24 (the former Italian in Japan in 1944. The German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 had ended the use of overland routes which were for the delivery of strategic materials from southeast Asia, and few Axis ships were able to avoid Allied patrols of the North Atlantic. Japan was interested in exchanging military technology with Germany, the Japanese submarine I-30 initiated the submerged transport of strategic materials in mid-1942 by delivering 1500 kg of mica and 660 kg of shellac.Blair, Clay Hitler's U-Boat War: The Hunted 1942‚Äì1945 (1998) Random House p.231Paterson (2004), p.33 Japanese submarines designed for the vast distances of the Pacific were more capable transports than the compact German U-boats which were designed for operations around coastal Europe; but large Italian submarines had proved ineffective for convoy attacks. The Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) converted seven Italian submarines operating from BETASOM into \\"transport submarines\\" in order to exchange rare or irreplaceable trade goods with Japan. They were: The Bagnolin, the Barbarigo, the Cappellini (renamed Aquilla III in May 1943), the Finzi, the Giuliani, the Tazzoli and the Torelli. Joint operations in the Indian Ocean The former U-511 after being presented to Japan as IJN RO-500. The idea of stationing U-boats in Malaya and the East Indies for operations in the Indian Ocean was first proposed by the Japanese in December 1942. As no supplies were available at either location, the idea was turned down, although a number of U-boats operated around the Cape of Good Hope at the time.Pre-Monsun Boats A few days after Cappellini reached the East Indies, U-511 became the first U-boat to complete the voyage. This boat carried the Japanese naval attache Admiral Naokuni Nomura from Berlin to Kure. The boat was given to Japan as RO-500; its German crew returned to Penang to provide replacement personnel for the main submarine base being established at a former British seaplane station on the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula.Blair, Clay Hitler's U-Boat War: The Hunted 1942‚Äì1945 (1998) Random House p.239 A second base was established at Kobe; small repair bases were located at Singapore, Jakarta, and Surabaya. As part of the dispersal of U-boat operations following heavy losses in the North Atlantic in early 1943, Wilhelm Dommes was ordered to sail his U-178 from his operating area off South Africa to assume command at Penang.Monsun boats =Early submarine patrols to Penang= *Japanese submarine I-30 sailed 22 August 1942 carrying German torpedoes, Torpedo Data Computer, search radar, Metox, hydrophone array, 50 Enigma machines and 240 Bolde sonar countermeasure charges.

First wave of Monsun Gruppe U-boats With the base established, twelve submarines were assigned to the \\"Monsun Gruppe\\" and directed to proceed to Penang, patrolling along allied trade routes for the duration of their voyage.

It can be launched from the ground or air as a rocket-powered missile or dropped from the air as a guided bomb. It carries a relatively small warhead, and was designed to be a precision low-collateral damage weapon for irregular warfare. It has been used in combat by the United States military during the War in Afghanistan. Development Raytheon developed the Griffin as a low-cost modular system, using components from earlier projects, including the FGM-148 Javelin and the AIM-9X Sidewinder. It was originally designed to be launched from the US Special Operations Command's MC-130W Dragon Spear gunship and can be guided either by a semi-active laser seeker or with GPS. Its precision combined with a relatively small 5.9 kg warhead reduces collateral damage.Smaller, Cheaper, Lighter William Matthews, Defense News, 31 May 2010 The munition comes in two versions. Griffin A is an unpowered precision munition that can be dropped from a rear cargo door or a door-mounted launcher that can drop while the cabin is pressurized. Weighing 15 kg and measuring 1.1 meters in length, it is launched from a 10-tube \\"Gunslinger\\" launcher that fits on the rear ramp of a Marine KC-130 tanker/transport or both the US Air Force AC-130W \\"Stinger II\\" and AC-130J \\"Ghostrider\\" gunship variants. Griffin Block II B is a short-range, rocket- powered air-to-surface or surface-to-surface missile that can be fired from UAVs as well as helicopters, attack aircraft, U.S. Air Force AC-130W gunships, and Marine Corps KC-130J tankers.\\"Who paid Raytheon to develop the Griffin missile for Predator UAVs?\\" Intelfusion. 15 June 2008 The missile's folding fins allow it to be launched from a 140 mm tube. It can be set to engage the target with height of burst, point detonation or fuze delay. The U.S. Navy has tested the Griffin as a shipboard missile guided by laser at fast-moving small boats; they planned to use it on the Littoral Combat Ships. The missile version is less than half the weight of a Hellfire round and includes a 5.9 kg warhead. It has a range of 15 km when air-launched, or 5.5 km when launched from the surface. It has been fired from the U.S. Army Remote weapon station, multi-round Wedge Launcher, Smart Launcher and Kiowa Warrior manned helicopters. The missile is smaller than the Hellfire typically used by armed UAVs, which reduces the potential for collateral damage. The Griffin missile and launch assembly is also lighter than the Hellfire, allowing more to be mounted on the Predator.Efforts Are Underway to Arm Small UAVs Aviation Week. 17 October 2008 Three Griffins can be carried in place of one Hellfire.

The Sea Griffin has a new motor and guidance system to increase its firing range from an LCS. Raytheon faced competition in equipping the LCS with a missile, as the Navy looked for other vendors. Competition came from MBDA with the Sea Spear version of its Brimstone missile. Both missiles are intended to give the LCS protection from small boat swarm attacks.Raytheon Working on Extending Range of Griffin Missile for LCS ‚Äì Defensenews.com, 23 June 2013 The Navy instead selected the AGM-114L Hellfire to equip the LCS. The decision was made from the ship's use of the Saab's Sea Giraffe radar. While each Griffin requires a semi-active laser to paint a target, so a volley of them can only engage one target at a time, the Longbow Hellfire missiles can use the ship's and their own millimeter wave radar to separately track and engage multiple targets at the same time.Navy Axes Griffin Missile In Favor of Longbow Hellfire for LCS ‚Äì News.USNI.org, 9 April 2014 fires a BGM-176B missile in June 2015.

The defensive halfback lines up inside covering the slotback. They are usually slightly larger than the cornerback to assist the linebackers in stopping the run. They can also be seen backing off the line early, to counter the forward motion of a slotback, which is allowed before the snap in the CFL. The cause of the difference in naming between the two positions between the American and Canadian game, which otherwise uses the same names for positions, stems from the early history of the game. In both games, the early formations featured identical offensive and defensive formations, with seven down linemen and four players (five in Canada) in the backfield. Thus, both the offense and defense had quarterbacks, halfbacks and fullbacks. Over the course of the 20th century, the American and Canadian games both placed an increased emphasis on forward passing, resulting in both offensive and defensive formations spreading out and morphing into modern formations. Furthermore, the abolition of the one-platoon system in the 1940s led to a tendency for position names being used on only one side of the ball. The American game, which still held a significant running component (modern American football is more balanced between both running and passing), kept two running backs, which led to the retention of the \\"halfback\\" and \\"fullback\\" identifications on that side of the ball. In Canadian football, however, passing was (and still is) a greater portion of the game (due in part to the larger field and one less down in that game) and only one running back was regularly used, leading to the offensive distinction between halfback and fullback eventually becoming obsolete. Historically, the offensive halfback was similar to a slotback and lined up off the tight end, running sweeps, pass patterns and performing blocking duties, but could also run out of the backfield in front of the fullback, much like a standard running back in American football. The rough equivalents of the halfback position in American football are the strong safety and nickelback.

Ibn Gharsiya was a leading figure in the Shu'ubiyya movement of Al- Andalus. He should not be confused with a Cordoban faqih of the same name. Personal background Ibn Gharsiya was born into a Christian Basque family, but was taken prisoner in his childhood and raised in the Islamic faith. He grew up proficient and eloquent in both Classical Arabic and the colloquial Andalusi Arabic dialect. Ibn Gharsiya was proud of his Basque origin and remained a lifelong fervent Muslim throughout his lifetime. His surname al- Bashkunsi is the Arabic word for Basque, and therefore, signified his Basque heritage. He served under the Slavic Emir of Denia, MujƒÅhid al-‚ÄòƒÄmirƒ´, and his son, Ali ibn Mujahid. Like Ibn Gharsiya, the ruling family of Denia were also Muladi and had broken free from the Caliphate of Cordoba after the turbulent year of 1009. Like other taifas, his kingdom had sought to distance itself from the Umayyad period. Ibn Gharsiya subsequently spent most of his life as a katib at the court of Denia. Ideology Ibn Gharsiya was a leading proponent and advocate of the Shu'ubiyya thought in Al-Andalus. The Shu'ubiyya movement demanded equality of power, wealth and status of the Non-Arab Berbers and Muwalladun by Arabs. In common with the Arabs, they were very active in promoting the Arab-Islamic culture and language and claimed cultural integration with the Arab ethnic groups‚Äîas had been achieved by the non-Arab Semitic peoples of the Middle East. The risala of Ibn Gharsiya Between 1051 and 1056, Ibn Gharsiya wrote a risala against the Arab ascendancy in al- Andalus, which concurrently praises non-Arab Islam. Opponents of this work have called it violent, insulting, and bitter in its attack on the Arabs and, contrary to prevailing tradition, it criticises Arab Muslims as inferior in rank and lineage. Simultaneously, it glorifies non-Arab Muslims, such as the Berbers, and also those converts from the Visigoths, Slavs, and Romans. In the risala, Ibn Gharsiya asserts cultural superiority of the Muwalladun over the Arabs by diminishing and belittling Arab culture. While he boasts about the Muladi mastery of natural philosophy, exact logic, astronomy, music, arithmetic, and geometry, he ridicules Arabs as \\"experts in the description of towering camels.\\" He also tries to show that non-Arab rule in Denia was much better than those of the other taifas. By doing so, he attempted to formulate and legitimise a non-Arab alternative to Arab rule which involved combining Arab and non-Arab traditions, which were mainly Persian and Byzantine. This gave him an opportunity to debate with the Arab Islamic scholar Abu Ja ªfar Ahmad ibn al-Jazzar, who had been present at the court of Ibn Sumadih, Emir of Almeria. However, according to the Escorial manuscript, the letter was addressed to a certain Abu  ªAbd Allah Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn al-Haddad al- Qaisi. However, despite this difference, it is clear that the addressee was linked to the court of Ibn Sumadih and to the taifa state of Almeria. Ibn Gharsiya's epistle addresses some of the most fundamental and important questions in the Muslim community of al-Andalus at the time, such as the relationship between the Arabs and Berbers of the Islamic faith with the Muwalladun, who were the descendants of the indigenous Iberian converts to Islam. Ibn Gharsiya stressed that a sound interpretation of Islam should also be of value to the non-Arab Muslims. This epistle represents the adoption of the Eastern Shu ªubi ideology by many indigenous Andalusian Muslims, which argued against Arab exclusivity, as expressed in their treatises comparing the Arabs unfavourably with the Persians and the Byzantines. Ibn Gharsiya's risala was written in Arabic courtly prose; thus it did not represent a rejection of Arabic literary culture, but only of Arab lineage. According to the Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature, this risala was of minor importance, and its few exponents tended to repeat clich√©s adopted from the earlier Islamic East. The risala elicited at least seven refutations, only five of which actually survive. Like the original, the refutations seem to have been written in imitation of eastern models. Only one of the refutations was specifically directed against Ibn Gharsiya. American scholar James T. Monroe states that the fact of Ibn Gharsiya's risala against the Arabs going unpunished, indicates that the cause of Arabism as a meaningful social force had ceased to have any political significance. G√∂ran Larsson, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, points out that in spite of his extensive use of Persian traditions in his risala, Ibn Gharsiya was not promoting a specifically Persian sovereign, merely a non-Arab model of rule. To this, Monroe adds: Legacy Besides the epistle, the only words from Ibn Gharsiya that has been preserved are some lines by the 12th century Andalusian geographer, historian and writer, Ibn Said al-Maghribi. These lines are believed to have been composed in praise of Ibn Gharsiya's lord, Ali ibn Mujahid.

It is one of four books in the mini-series and features Grey Star, for whom the first book is named, a young Wizard trained by the enigmatic Shianti to stop the Wytch-King and his Shadakine Empire. All four of the Grey Star books were released by Project Aon along with many of the other installments of the Lone Wolf series. Gameplay The gameplay of the World of Lone Wolf series is very much like the other Lone Wolf books, but features a few key differences. One is the inclusion of Willpower, which can be used for various Magical effects in the game, and maybe most importantly to loose a blast of Magic from your Wizards Staff when it is in your possession. The ability to vanquish some enemies with the expenditure of a Willpower point or two introduces a key strategic consideration in which the reader must choose between the likely loss of Endurance that comes with fighting enemies, and the amount of Willpower that should be saved for later in the story. Plot The series plays for the most part at the tip of south-eastern Magnamund, in the land then known as the Shadakine Empire. A tyrant called Shasarak the Wytch-King has subjugated the people and with the help of seven Shadaki Wytches is ruling with an iron fist. The Shianti, members of a mystical race, wish to help, but because of their exile on the Isle of Lorn they are forced to remain neutral in the conflict. However, one night the situation changes when a storm wrecks a vessel near the island, with a human infant being the only survivor. In this child the Shianti see a chance to help the people of Magnamund without breaking their vow to Ishir, and they raise the boy in the arts of magic, giving him the name Grey Star: the star as the symbol of hope, and grey for the white-grey streak the boy has in his dark hair. Once his training is complete, Grey Star is sent out to retrieve the Moonstone, an ancient Shianti artefact, from the Daziarn, for only with its power can Shasarak be defeated. The first book of the series details Grey Stars travel to the Shadakine Empire and his desperate attempt to find a guide to lead him to the Shadow Gate.

Background McGrath was born Jane Louise Steele on 4 May 1966 to Jen and Roy Steele, a now retired newsagent in Paignton, Devon, England. She worked as a flight attendant for Virgin Atlantic when she met her future husband in a Hong Kong nightclub in 1995. They married in 1999 at the Garrison Church and had two children. She became an Australian citizen on Australia Day, 26 January 2002. McGrath was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) on 26 January 2008 for service to community health through support for women with breast cancer and the establishment of the McGrath Foundation. Cancer McGrath first learned she had breast cancer in 1997 at the age of 31. Following a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, she was deemed cancer-free by June 1998. Despite fears that cancer treatment may have left her sterile, she later gave birth to two children who were both breast-fed. In 2003, McGrath was diagnosed with metastatic disease in her bones. In 2004, she appeared with her husband on Andrew Denton's Enough Rope on the ABC, describing her work for the foundation and her personal experiences. In early 2006, brain metastasis was found and by May, she was undergoing radiation treatment at three-week intervals. The tumour was found and successfully removed. At the time, she lost her hair and became depressed, but again went into remission and continued her work with the foundation. She became severely ill in mid-June 2008 and died on the morning of 22 June at her Cronulla home; she was 42. McGrath's funeral was held at the Garrison Church. McGrath Foundation In 2005 Glenn and Jane McGrath founded the McGrath Foundation, a charitable organisation dedicated to raising money to fund breast care nurses in rural and regional Australia, and to increase breast awareness in young women. As of December 2018, 120 McGrath breast care nurses have been placed in communities throughout Australia, supporting over 67,000 Australian families experiencing breast cancer. The third day of the first Sydney test cricket match at the Sydney Cricket Ground each year is now known as Jane McGrath Day, where money is raised for the McGrath Foundation. Spectators at the SCG wear pink to show their support and sponsor logos in various places are also recoloured pink for the match. The Ladies Stand is also temporarily renamed The Jane McGrath Stand for the day. On 5 January 2013, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced an $18.5 million donation to the McGrath Foundation from the Australian Government. The funding allowed all 44 existing McGrath breast care nurse positions to continue and expand the program by 10 full-time equivalent places.

Following the reign of Idi Amin when the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was banned and the murder of Bah√° º√≠ Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga and his family, the community continues to grow though estimates of the population range widely from 19,000 to 105,000 and the community's involvements have included diverse efforts to promote the welfare of the Ugandan people. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated about 78,500; however, National Population & Housing Census, 2014 recorded only 29,601. Early phase ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Tablets of the Divine Plan=  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916‚Äì1917; these letters were compiled together in the book Tablets of the Divine Plan. The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentioned Africa and were written on April 19, 1916, and February 15, 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919‚Äîafter the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The tablets were translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° mentions Bah√° º√≠s traveling \\"‚Ä¶especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China.

Tiberondwa, Utafiti Journal, vol 2, no. 1, then associated with the UN, gave a talk at the New York Bah√° º√≠ Center.African to address meeting, The New York Age, 21 September 1946, page 4 Particular plans to bring the religion to Uganda began in 1950 involving the cooperation of American, British, Egyptian, and Persian Bah√° º√≠ communities and reached a level of coordination and detail that materials were translated into languages widely used in Africa before pioneers reached Africa. On August 3, 1951 Mr. and Mrs. M√∫s√° Ban√°n√≠, Mrs. Violette and Mr. Ali Nakhjavani, of Iran, with their baby daughter Bahiyyih, and Mr. Philip Hainsworth arrived in Kampala. Ban√°n√≠ was an adult convert to the religion during World War I from a Jewish background. After receiving the news that Hand of the Cause Louis George Gregory -- Hands of the Cause are a select group of Bah√° º√≠s who achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion -- had died previously on July 31, a commemorative meeting for Gregory was held in Kampala at which the five pioneers and Marguerite Preston (from Kenya) were joined by twelve Africans. In October an observance of the birth of the B√°b was the first to be held in the home of a Bugandan citizen of Uganda, with prayers said in Luganda. In December, the first two native Ugandans had converted to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith -- Fred Bigabwa (Mutoro tribe) and Chrispin Kajubi (Buganda tribe). While Ban√°n√≠ was on pilgrimage War War II veteran Enoch Olinga (of Iteso tribe) who had been attending classes taught by Nakhjavani in Kampala was the third Ugandan to become a Bah√° º√≠ and swore off alcohol though his alcoholism had already cost him his government job. Ethnolinguistic map of Uganda. The first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly in the country was elected in April 1952 in Kampala. The members of the assembly were Fred Bigabwa, Chrispin Kajubi, Peter Musoke, Enoch Olinga, Mr and Mrs M√∫s√° Ban√°n√≠, Mr and Mrs Ali Nakhjavani and Philip Hainsworth. These were soon joined by American pioneers, Mary and Reginald (Rex) Collison, in about May. In early 1952, M√∫s√° Ban√°n√≠ was also appointed as a Hand of the Cause. In the summer of 1952 the Bah√° º√≠s bought the first center for hosting meetings. By October 1952 there were 55 members of the religion including Olinga's father, living in 12 different localities and representing 9 different tribes: Ganda, Gishu, Gwero, Kabarasi, Kakamega, Luo, Sega, Teso, Toro. Six of them were women. Eighteen were in Kampala and 26 in Teso country. Like Olinga other Bah√° º√≠s effected a change in character when converting to the religion and giving up alcoholism. These joined the religion by conversion from Roman Catholic, Protestant and pagan backgrounds and the rural areas were organized into committees until Assemblies could be organized. In February 1953 the first inter-continental conference of four designated by the head of the religion was taking place in Kampala. On the program were Hands of the Cause (already appointed or not yet) Dorothy Beecher Baker,  ªAl√≠-Akbar Fur√∫tan, Ugo Giachery, Hermann Grossman,  ªAl√≠-Muhammad Varq√°, George Townshend, and Dhikru'llah Khadem giving a wide variety of talks and classes across 7 days opened with a message from Shoghi Effendi read by Hand of the Cause Leroy Ioas. By April nine more assemblies were elected among a community of over two hundred ninety members of the religion, residing in twenty-five localities, and representative of twenty tribes. In June 1953 the American pioneers Mr. and Mrs. Rex Collison moved to Ruanda-Urundi from Kampala. In October 1953 Olinga went on to Cameroon and was honoured with the title Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Developing community Wide-scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa was observed to begin in the 1950s and extend in the 1960s. After the conference in February 1953 Bill and Marguerite Sears arrived in September 1953 visiting from Johannesburg for an extended stay into October giving many classes and traveling to many villages. It was also during this time the first pioneer from Uganda went to Mwanza, Tanganyika. In 1954 Uganda had 500 Bah√° º√≠s in 80 localities, including 13 Local Spiritual Assemblies, representing 30 tribes, and had dispatched 9 pioneers to other African locations. In 1955 there were over 800 Bah√° º√≠s having just added seventeen assemblies. In 1956 Olinga was elected as Chairman of the North West regional Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly and the Ugandan Bah√° º√≠ community came under the newly formed regional National Spiritual Assembly of Central & Eastern Africa, of which Nakhjavani was the Chairman and the Ugandan community alone topped 1000 members. The other members of the regional assembly over Uganda were Philip Hainsworth, Hassan Sabri, Oloro Epyeruj, Aziz Yazdi, Jalal Nakhjavani, Tito Wanantsusit, Sylvester Okurut, and Max Kenyerezi. In early 1957 Olinga attended the laying of the foundation stone of the first Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship of Africa (which was in Uganda) and in the fall he was appointed a Hand of the Cause and Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h Clare Gung, formerly of Germany, moved from Tanganyika to Uganda where she founded a multi-racial kindergarten nursery. Systems were initiated to deal with the rate of growth of the religion - weekend Bah√° º√≠ schools were set up for any Bah√° º√≠ who could attend and individuals who were judged to have a substantial understanding of the religion and were able to travel were selected for training as presenters who would then travel locally in their area to make presentations on many of the same themes. By the summer of 1957 13 weekend schools had been held. It was believed these schools lent impetus to the continued growth of the religion in the area by empowering local members of the religion and the schools were repeated in 1958. And the same year regional and local assemblies were registered with the civil government. In 1957 a lone Bah√° º√≠, a member of the Tesa, Yokolamu Okello, reached the relatively remote and pagan region of Moroto in Karamoja and in 1958 the first spiritual assembly was formed there. Conversions to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Uganda even reached into the prisons where Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, responded to letters by encouraging the inmates to use their \\"stumbled\\" history not to become \\"embittered or defeated\\" but \\"determined to make it a means of purifying your natures, improving your characters, and enabling you to become better citizens in the future.\\" The quick growth of the religion in Uganda was attributed by Bah√° º√≠s to the sincerity of their purpose and to the demonstrated lack of racial prejudice. =House of Worship= In 1958 the land for the temple had to be bought in the name of three African Ugandan Bah√° º√≠s rather than an institution directly foreign or domestic. These Bah√° º√≠s were Joseph Mbogo, Erisha Kiwanuka and Max Kanyerezi who held the land in trust. The Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Uganda, named as the Mother Temple of Africa, is situated on Kikaya Hill on the outskirts of Kampala. At the ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone in 1958 Hands of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum and M√∫s√° Ban√°n√≠ presented material gifts for the building - some soil from the inner-most Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and the fortress of Maku where the B√°b was imprisoned. The building was designed by Mason Remey and the green dome is made of fixed mosaic tiles from Italy, the lower roof tiles are from Belgium, and the colored glass in the wall panels was brought from Germany. Nine massive columns, each two feet in diameter, support the great dome, itself forty-four feet in diameter at its base; while the two roofs are supported by two sets of twenty seven slightly smaller columns. The overall height is 127 ft., the internal diameter of the building is eighty four feet and the seating capacity is over 600. The inside of the dome is painted a pale blue; the rotunda, into which are set nine enormous windows and fifty-four small windows, all filled with green, amber and pale blue glass, is painted a brilliant white, while the columns and the lower walls are painted a very pale green. All this lends itself to an effect of lightness and airiness which is intensified by the large green and amber glass-filled grilles which stand on either side of the huge mvule doors. The fifty-acre property includes the House of Worship, extensive gardens, a guest house, and an administrative center. In 1960 the Ugandan government built an access road out to the site of the temple and a Bugandan council of ministers came to see the building. Observances of Bah√° º√≠ Holy days are held and regular services are normally held about 4 pm on Sunday afternoons. By the end of 1965 an estimated 50,000 visitors had come to the temple. Both Hands of the Cause Enoch Olinga and M√∫s√° Ban√°n√≠ are buried near the Temple. Dedication Practising Baha'is Festivities associated with the opening of the temple were wide-ranging through early 1961. The Ugandan government publication Uganda Argus covered the history and description of the temple in the January 1961 issue and interviews and stories ran on the Ugandan Broadcasting service on radio. Events on site began on the 13th with a unity feast with Hands of the Cause Musa Banani, John Robarts, Rahmatu'll√°h Muh√°jir and Chairman of the regional assembly Ali Nakhkajvani and vice-chairman O]oro Epyeru giving talks. The temple was dedicated on 14th led by Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum where there was a viewing of portraits of the B√°b and Bah√° ºu'll√°h. And the public inaugural service was held on the 15th. Over 1500 people attended. Among the Bah√° º√≠s were some 225 African Bah√° º√≠s from Uganda, Kenya, Tanganyika, Ruanda Urundi, Ethiopia, Northern Rhodesia, Swaziland, and South Africa; some 90 Persian Baha'is, sixty-two of whom flew from Tehran; the British national assembly, the mother assembly to that of Central and East Africa, sent one believer from each of its regions - England, Scotland and Wales, as well as one from Ireland; the American national assembly sent one of its members, Amos Gibson, himself a pioneer among the American Indian peoples. Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga was unable to attend due to political turmoil in Cameroon Olinga was attempting to help them with. A choir, especially selected from among Kampala's singers and directed by Peter Wingard of Makerere College sang music and readings offered were from the Old and New Testaments and the Qur ºan, plus a number of prayers and readings from the Bah√° º√≠ writings in Arabic, Persian, Ateso, Swahili, Acholi, Luganda and English. Following the public meeting a reception was held for representatives of the Governor and the Kabaka of Buganda, together with the Mayor of Kampala at which Ruhiyyih Khanum shared a story that Shoghi Effendi had traveled through the region in the early 1920s. Following the dedication Ruhiyyih Khanum and chairman Nakhkajvani embarked on 15 days of visiting Bah√° º√≠s through Uganda and Kenya including staying in their homes, dedicating two schools, ate native food, and were honored with traditional songs and dances. Khanum suggested repeatedly that the Ugandan's own folklore, their traditions and their native songs and music should not be discarded, but that in a society of unity in diversity they were to preserve and develop these as their contribution in enriching the spiritual and material life of human society as well as noting the equality of the sexes and that women should take equal part in administration of the religion. =Intercontinental conferences= First conference In January 1958, soon after the death of Shoghi Effendi in November, another intercontinental conference was held in Kampala and attended by his widow Ruhiyyih Khanum. Though sorrowful at his death, there was a call to service in honor of his service. The conference had been initially planned for less than 400 attendees and was overwhelmed as news of over 300 Persians alone were coming. Ultimately some 950 Bah√° º√≠s, six Hands of the Cause, a member of the International Bah√° º√≠ Council, sixteen Auxiliary Board members, and representatives from eleven national spiritual assemblies (including those from the four African regional assemblies, those from the other national assemblies which had participated in campaign to bring the religion to sub-Saharan Africa - Britain, India, Iraq, Persia, and the United States - and those from Arabia and Japan), 450 African members, over 300 from Persia, two Knights of Bah√° ºu'll√°h (one from the Pacific and one from the Arctic), and others from rest of the world were present at the formal convening of the conference as well as telegrams received from many other Hands of the Cause and 34 national assemblies arrived. Reportedly every hotel room was booked. Ruhiyyih Khanum anointed most attendees with Attar of rose before being admitted into a viewing of relics of Bah√° ºu'll√°h as well as a reproduction of a painting of him on the first day of the conference. Viewings were also held of a large map by Shoghi Effendi showing the progress of the religion, films of Shrines and gardens from the Bah√° º√≠ World Center, as it existed then, as well as the Monument on the grave of Shoghi Effendi. Some $280,000 was raised at the conference from a segment of the attendees for donation to the progress of the religion. The foundation stone for the Mother Temple of Africa was laid and relics in silk bags made by Bahiyyih Kh√°num were set in place (planned to be under the wall on that side of the Temple facing out across a grassy valley towards the Bah√° º√≠ Qiblih.) Ruhiyyih Khanum then spent a day among the Tseo people - speaking to school groups, receiving guests, and visiting homes. She donated money for the reconstruction of a center that had been lost. Second Conference Six conferences held in October 1967 around the world presented a viewing of a copy of the photograph of Bah√° ºu'll√°h on the highly significant occasion commemorating the centennial of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's writing of the Suriy-i-Mul√∫k (Tablet to the Kings), which Shoghi Effendi describes as \\"the most momentous Tablet revealed by Bah√° ºu'll√°h\\". After a meeting in Edirne (Adrianople), Turkey, the Hands of the Cause travelled to the conferences, with each carrying a copy of the photograph of Bah√° º√∫'ll√°h. Hand of the Cause  ªAl√≠-Akbar Fur√∫tan conveyed this photograph to the Conference for Africa at Uganda. Ebony magazine covered the event. Ugandan radio, television and print media covered the events related to the conference as well. Some 400 Bah√° º√≠s from twenty-four African countries gathered. Kolonerio Oule, chairman of the National Assembly for Uganda and Central Africa, opened the conference on the first day and Hands of the Cause  ªAl√≠-Akbar Fur√∫tan and Enoch Olinga began presentations and discussions about the history of the tablets and the range of who they were made for. The next day the new national center building on the same property as the temple was dedicated - it is a circular building having a round central auditorium surrounded by a group of offices, a library, archives, publishing, guest roams and kitchen. The third day William Masehla and speaker Helen Elsie Austin focused attention on the role of the individual in the progress of the religion. That evening a public meeting of some 500 people was held followed by a reception for 250 people; efforts had focused invitations to government personnel, clergy, educational institutions and professional communities. Roger White was a representative of the Canadian national Assembly which made a gift to the Bah√° º√≠s of Uganda in the form of an illuminated tablet of the writings of the religion. =Other developments= It was in 1958 that the Bah√° º√≠s of Kampala contracted to reserve a segment of a cemetery for use by Bah√° º√≠s. Weekend schools begun in 1958 continued through 1960 though classes now used chapters from Bah√° ºu'll√°h and the New Era by John Esslemont. In September 1961, a number of permanent Bah√° º√≠ schools were set up--two Louis Gregory Bah√° º√≠ Schools, one in Tilling, the home town of Olinga, and the other in Dusai. Courses emphasized homecraft and child rearing mixed with presentations on the religion and men supported women taking the courses. News of the openings was covered in Jet Magazine. The extraordinary number of enrollments in Uganda and Kenya had reached the point in late 1959 that the institution of the Hands of the Cause were noting there were not enough Bah√° º√≠s to keep up with the work of checking the enrollments. 1961 also saw the development of a Ugandan Bah√° º√≠ publishing trust. Olinga was able to re- visit Uganda in June, and again in August‚ÄìSeptember 1962 when he toured widely in Uganda speaking to many groups amounting to thousands of people about the religion before moving on to Kenya and Tanganyika and the Congo. As the monthly rate of growth reached into the hundreds, a goal of the Uganda Teaching Committee was of stimulating the individual assemblies and believers to assume increasing responsibility for weekend schools in their own villages so that traveling teachers could focus in other areas. In September 1962 Milton Obote, then Prime Minister of Uganda, visited the Shrine of the Bab. In 1963 Nakhjavani was elected to the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the worldwide Bah√° º√≠ community, while Olinga chaired the first Bah√° º√≠ World Congress which announced the election to the world. By the end of 1963 there were 554 Local Spiritual Assemblies in various localities, 389 smaller Bah√° º√≠ groups, and some 200 isolated individual Bah√° º√≠s spread across Uganda. In 1964 the regional Assemblies were reassigned and Uganda joined with the Central African Republic. The July 1964 issue of Uganda Argus profiled the religion as well as a broad article about the 4 Bah√° º√≠ Houses of Worship then in existence. One hundred thirty-two delegates and visitors assembled in Kampala, Uganda, for the 1966 convention to elect the regional national assembly of Uganda and Central Africa. Olinga was able to visit Uganda again from October to December 1967 for an extended tour of the country. Rapid expansion of the religion in the late 1960s was most particularly true in Uganda, Vietnam and Indonesia. The 1968 membership of the regional national assembly of Uganda and Central Africa was: Hassan Sabri, Tito Wanantsrusri, Kolonerio Oule, Elizabeth Olinga, George William Ebetu, Moses Senoga, Sospateri Isimai, Alinote Colleque, and Albert Ocnamodek. During the period of Ayy√°m-i-H√° 1969 the Bah√° º√≠s had a public exhibit on the religion at the Kamapala national theatre. The mayor of Kampala spoke at the opening preceding the showing of the film, \\"And His Name Shall Be One\\". The exhibit consisted of books, charts, artifacts, photographs, movies, slides, and recordings. Original Tablets, books, and excerpts written by the B√°b, Bah√° ºu'll√°h, and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° were displayed along with secondary works. Bah√° º√≠ history was illustrated in a chart depicting events from the birth of Bah√° ºu'll√°h to the founding of the Universal House of Justice, plus displays of The Dawn-Breakers in three languages. The arts were shown in oil paintings, photographs, silverwork, and handwoven carpets and the diversity of nationalities and religious backgrounds was illustrated with photographs and slides taken during conventions, Temple dedications, and intercontinental conferences. Later that summer Ruhiyyih Khanum visited Uganda on a ten-day tour. In Kampala she was able to attend several events before driving into the countryside to visit Bah√° º√≠s. In town events included: a reception given in her honor and that of two visiting members of the Universal House of Justice, Hushmand Fatheazam and 'Ali Nahkjavani; to deliver a public lecture in the hall of the national theater; to be interviewed for a full half hour on Radio Uganda on the \\"Guest of the Week\\" program; and attend a wedding at the temple along with fellow Hands of the Cause Enoch Olinga and M√∫s√° B√°nan√≠ before going on to Ethiopia and other countries on a four-month tour. She returned at the end of the tour for a few days of low key meetings with Bah√° º√≠s before her final departure. Momentous changes approaching In 1970 Mary Collison died - together Mary and Reginald Collison had spent their last years as caretakers of the temple. That summer Ugandan Bah√° º√≠s held their first national youth conference and elected a national assembly just for Uganda - the first members were: Enos Epyeru, Javan Gutosi, S. M. lsimai, Moses Senoga, Julias Nambafu, Augustin Massati, Augustin Naku, and Albert Ocamodek. On the Presidency of Idi Amin in August, the Bah√° º√≠s were among those invited to a meeting with the President. At the meeting the Bah√° º√≠s offered a statement outlining the basic principle of the religion of obedience to government. At a follow-up meeting, Enoch Olinga represented the community at the close of a number of sessions of Religious Conferences that took place across Uganda. Soon afterwards, M√∫s√° Ban√°n√≠ died in September after suffering a long illness and was buried on grounds of the temple in a new Bah√° º√≠ cemetery. The funeral gathered together three Hands of the Cause: Enoch Olinga, A. Q. Faizi, Ruhiyyih Khanum; a member of The Universal House of Justice, Ali Nakbjavani, Violette Nakhjavani and their daughter, Bahiyyih, whose wedding took place two years ago in Kampala to Paul Adams many other Bah√° º√≠ leaders from across Africa as well as six members of the National Spiritual Assembly of Uganda; and many other Baha'is from all over Uganda and other parts of Africa. Pioneers like Zylpha Mapp served development interests in Uganda in 1971-2 while working as a director of guidance at the Tororo Girls' School. She was on a leave of absence from the public school system from her work in the States, and was cooperating with the Uganda Ministry of Education in developing a guidance program in other schools of the nation while also began editing the Ugandan National Baha'i Newsletter. Later in 1971 then President Amin attended the celebration of the birth of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and made complimentary remarks about the religion. These and others worked with university researchers on mental health issues as well. Efforts inside the community included noting the importance of Bah√° º√≠ elections as part of a worldwide initiative called for by the Universal House of Justice. Other projects in 1971-2 for Uganda included beautification of the cemetery, spreading the religion, and multiple youth gatherings. In 1972 Bah√° º√≠ Dwight W. Allen won an Award of Merit for helping in the establishment of the Tororo Girls' School which was transitioned to administration by the Ugandan government. Enoch Olinga's daughter Florence began attending the Tororo school in 1972 while other youth began making trips to various communities in support of Bah√° º√≠ activities. In 1973 Enoch Olinga and his wife both spoke at the Tororo School while the school also had visits from other leaders of the religion. In 1975-6 the Olingas toured parts of Uganda as well as having talks with government officials on the teachings of the religion with some of their travels covered by announcements by radio. Meanwhile, a public exhibit on the religion was held at the national museum which was covered by the now renamed Voice of Uganda national newsletter as well as examine Bah√° º√≠ teachings. 1975 was the silver anniversary of the religion in Uganda and a celebration, commemorating it was concluded with a program in observance of United Nations Day and a reception of high-ranking official guests from other Ghana and the UN, and members of the religion who had come from some villages. In 1976 Zylpha Mapp-Robinson, the daughter of the first African-American woman Bah√° º√≠, who had pioneered in many places and who lived in Uganda nine years, was elected to the national spiritual assembly of Uganda in 1976. In June 1977 a small conference of leaders of the religion including the Olingas was held to discuss the progress of the growth of the religion. It was unusual in that even though just 52, 13 of whom were youth, were at the meeting, they received a message from the Universal House of Justice. Enoch Olinga reminded the group that Shoghi Effendi had called the Ugandan community the spiritual heart of Africa. In September the administrative institutions of the religion had been disbanded by the government along with over two dozen other groups. Soon the Uganda-Tanzania War broke out in 1978 and President Amin was overthrown by early 1979. Oppression, violence, and freedom As part of a sweep across several Sub-Saharan countries, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was banned in the 1970s in several countries: Burundi, 1974; Mali 1976; Uganda 1977; Congo, 1978; Niger, 1978. Uganda had had the largest Bah√° º√≠ community in Africa at the time and Olinga had returned and sought the protection of the community during this difficult time when Idi Amin's regime ruled Uganda. See also Uganda under Idi Amin. > \\"This was principally the result of a campaign by a number of Arab > countries.

However, the Baha'is were able > to demonstrate to these governments that they were not agents of Zionism nor > anti-Islamic and succeeded in having the ban reversed in all of these > countries except Niger.\\" It was a period of violence from 1978. In March 1979 the Olinga home was robbed though the temple was undisturbed and there was a suspicious accident where Olinga's car was rammed and forced down a hill by a troop transport vehicle, where he was robbed and left for dead, and Olinga's son George was disappeared for a week by soldiers of Amin. Death threats perhaps simply because of his prominence came to Olinga from his home town. Meanwhile, after President Amin fled in April the religion began to re-organize - there was the re-opening of the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship again, and the beginning of reforming the national assembly in August. Neighbors and a garden servant boy bore witness mostly by hearing events of the execution of the Olinga family. On the evening of Sunday, September 16, 1979, the birthday of one of Olinga's daughters and planned as a day of a family reunion of which a few could not arrive in time, after 8pm local time five soldiers entered Olinga's home while one stood guard at the household gate and killed Olinga, his wife, and three of their five children. Trails of blood went from the kitchen to the back of the house and one of the children had been hurt and roughly bandaged before the family was executed. Enoch himself was killed out in the yard where he had been heard weeping after perhaps witnessing his dead family in the very same house he had joined the religion in. The news was conveyed initially by the garden servant to a member of the national committee that had been appointed and then to a 79-year-old pioneer, Claire Gung, who called internationally. Ultimately news reached the Universal House of Justice while it sat in session on the 17th. All the dead were buried in the Bah√° º√≠ cemetery on the temple grounds on the 25th while civil war and terrorism continued. The funeral included hundreds of Bah√° º√≠s who could make the trip and several members of the government of Uganda. After the Uganda-Tanzania War and when the ban on the religion was rescinded, Ugandan Bah√° º√≠s re-formed their National Spiritual Assembly in 1981, though the Ugandan Bush War dragged on. In 1982 the two primary schools the Bah√° º√≠s had founded in 1961 were again under Bah√° º√≠ administration by February 1982. More than 200 Bah√° º√≠s and non-Bah√° º√≠s gathered in 1983 to celebrate children and a kindergarten multi-racial nursery school established by Claire Gung and Rex Collison died in June 1983. Instances of hundreds of people joining the religion recurred in 1984. In about February 1985 George Olinga and Benson Kariuki gave a talk at one the primary schools about the religion about the institutions of the religion and Claire Gung died while the nursery she established was assumed by the national assembly and funds were allotted for the renovation of the primary schools. In 1986-7 Dwight W. Allen returned to Uganda and was the project coordinator for the Donors' Conference for the rehabilitation of Makerere University. In 1988 the community held a children's conference and was visible in a number of public events including a preferential trade exhibition at which various governmental leaders visited. Multiplying involvements The Ugandan Bah√° º√≠ community has been involved in a wide range of projects many of which benefit the nation while also advancing awareness of the religion. In 1989 a Bah√° º√≠ expert and businessman in using appropriate technology from Swaziland traveled through six southern and eastern African countries including Uganda training local people in the manufacture of several kinds of fence-making machines and other technologies in building, agriculture and water programs. The 10-day training courses were organized by the National Spiritual Assemblies in each of the six countries. In 1989 a Bah√° º√≠ Club was organized for Makerere University composed of Bah√° º√≠s and non-Bah√° º√≠s while the national assembly invited members of the Department of Religious Studies at Makerere University to the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship to familiarize staff with the religion, its institutions and how they function to contextualize the interaction between the agencies of the religion and the university while it implemented two new courses designed and taught by a Bah√° º√≠, Dr. Tim Rost, on \\"Peace and Justice\\" and another on \\"Religion and Development.\\" At the same time Bah√° º√≠ women of Mbale took part in events organized by the National Council on Women by a multicultural children's program emphasizing good neighborliness and handicrafts of women - government administrators observed that Bah√° º√≠s had several programs advancing diverse issues in Uganda. In 1990 the Bah√° º√≠ Office of Social and Economic Development in Uganda established a project to train healthcare field workers for work in Uganda. In 1993 the national assembly added a project to develop a middle-level management training program for community level primary health care workers. The focus was on prevention of childhood diseases, maternal-infant health care, and community building. Later, the Uganda Bah√° º√≠ Institute for Development set up a project introducing use of the latrine, immunization, and nets to fight off malaria- bearing mosquitoes, and people learned the importance of clean water in a Ugandan village. In 2000, the Bah√° º√≠s of Uganda shared their activities in the areas of education, family health, moral training for children, publishing, and collaboration with other non-governmental organizations at a national United Nations Day celebration held at the Muguluka Primary School near Jinja. After receiving her Ph.D. at age 78, Zylpha Mapp-Robinson returned to Uganda at age 86 in the year 2000 to create the Ugandan Institution for the advancement of Women. In 2002 a National Conference in Guyana on \\"Spiritual Approach to the Challenge of HIV/AIDS\\" sponsored by the Varqa Foundation, UNICEF, & Bah√° º√≠ International Community highlighted experiences in Uganda dealing with the AIDS epidemic by including the role of the spiritual training of children on virtues like humility, reverence, kindliness, respect and courtesy, and unity in diversity so that they would lead moral lives and overcome not only AIDS but alcohol and drug abuse, violence, crime, prejudice, hatred, intolerance and poverty. In 2004 the Bah√° º√≠-based Uganda Program of Literacy for Transformation helped participants acquire the skills, knowledge, and incentive for a ‚Äúlifelong self-improvement plan‚Äù ‚Äî coupled with an emphasis on moral education and inter-religious harmony. The Ugandan Bah√° º√≠ community has also encouraged the practice of the arts. Eighteen youth from Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Tanzania joined together to form Youth in Motion, a Bah√° º√≠ Workshop (see Oscar DeGruy) aimed at expressing the message brought by Bah√° ºu'll√°h. The group traveled for four months, performing before a total of more than 50,000 people in three countries. In 1998 Bah√° º√≠ Margaret Nagawa held a showing at the Ugandan National Museum, and award-winning Bah√° º√≠ Edel'Akongu Ekodelele Eyperu died in 2002. In 2001 a week-long celebration featuring a statement by Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, some 2000 of the Ugandan Baha'i community commemorated the 50th anniversary of its founding. The Bah√° º√≠s of Uganda have continued to be involved in social issues; in 2007 a movie on development issues in Uganda was produced by the Bah√° º√≠s named \\"Opening a Space - The Discourse on Science, Religion and Development in Uganda\\" and on 25 November 2007 the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship was a rallying point on for the \\"Speak out! Stand out!\\" campaign on preventing violence against women. Bah√° º√≠ delegates from Uganda and 14 other countries convened in New York from February 23 - March 7 for the 52nd session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women in 2008. Ugandan Bah√° º√≠s have also participated in recent international Bah√° º√≠ events. Ugandan youth were among the 149 assembled at the National Bah√° º√≠ Center in Burundi in August 2006. In 2007 Bah√° º√≠s in Entebbe helped organize World Religion Day commemorations. In 2008 one of the delegates from Uganda was one of the 19 tellers who counted the secret ballots for the election of the Universal House of Justice. Demographics During 2000‚Äì2002 estimates of the Ugandan Bah√° º√≠ community ranged widely; sources range from 66,000 to 105,000 Bah√° º√≠s in the country. The 2002 national census counted almost 19,000 Bah√° º√≠s, and the 2014 census reported 29,601. Inbetween, the 2005 US Dept. State statistics estimated Hinduism, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, and Judaism together formed 2% of the national population. About 300 Bah√° º√≠ believers were in Kampala according to a 2007 news report.

Club playing career Pashutin played in six teams during his professional playing career, but he did not win any major club titles. His only title as a professional club player was the Russian Super League title in 2003, which he won with CSKA Moscow. National team playing career As a player, Pashutin was a long-time member of the senior Russian national basketball team. With Russia, he played at the following major international tournaments: the 1994 FIBA World Championship, the 1995 EuroBasket, the 1997 EuroBasket, the 1999 EuroBasket, the 2000 Summer Olympics, the 2001 EuroBasket, and the 2002 FIBA World Championship. He won a silver medal at the 1994 FIBA World Championship, and a bronze medal at the 1997 EuroBasket.Evgueni PASHUTIN (RUS). Coaching career Pashutin's first title as a basketball coach came in 2004, when he and his CSKA Moscow junior team won the junior level Euroleague Next Generation Tournament title. Months later, he won the Russian Junior League. After the 2003‚Äì04 season ended, Pashutin became the head coach of the Under-20 Russian National Team. After an impressive season with the CSKA junior team, Pashutin became the assistant coach in the professional senior men's CSKA Moscow team to Ettore Messina. In 2005, CSKA won the Russian Cup and the Russian Super League. In the summer of 2005, Pashutin won the 2005 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship, and in the next season, CSKA won the EuroLeague, Russian Cup, and Russian Super League titles. In the 2006‚Äì07 season, CSKA were the runners-up in the EuroLeague, but won both the Russian Cup and Russian Super League titles. In 2008, CSKA again won the EuroLeague title and the Russian Super League titles, but didn't win the Russian Cup, in which they were the runners-up. Pashutin became the head coach of CSKA's senior men's team in the 2009‚Äì10 season ‚Äì CSKA dominated the Russian Super League and won it, and also won the Russian Cup. CSKA also won the VTB United League, the renamed VTB Promo-Cup, for the second year in a row. In the EuroLeague, CSKA made the Final Four, but lost in the semifinals and finished in 3rd place. He left CSKA after that season. Pashutin then moved on to UNICS Kazan, where he won the European-wide secondary level EuroCup championship, in the 2010‚Äì11 season. With UNICS, he also debuted as a head coach for the first time in the EuroLeague, in the 2011‚Äì12 season, in which UNICS reached the playoffs. He was also runner-up of the VTB United League in 2012. Pashutin then signed with Lokomotiv-Kuban for the 2012‚Äì13 season ‚Äì in his first season with the club, Pashutin once again led his team to EuroCup glory, as they won the 2012‚Äì13 edition. He also led his team to the finals of the VTB League, where they lost to his former team, CSKA Moscow. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, Lokomotiv played in the EuroLeague, reaching the Top 16 phase. Lokomotiv was also the runner-up in the Russian Cup, which they lost to UNICS. Pashutin left Lokomotiv after a disappointing finish in the VTB League season, where the club lost in the league's quarterfinals to CSKA Moscow. Pashutin then returned to UNICS on November 19, 2014, after signing with the club for remaining 2014‚Äì15 season. That time, Pashutin's tenure was without much success. Despite Pashutin improving the club's performance, UNICS endured a failed season in all competitions ‚Äì with a disappointing finish in the EuroLeague, where the team was eliminated after the regular season, a loss in the semifinals of the EuroCup, and a quarterfinals exit in the VTB League. In a surprise move, UNICS re-signed Pashutin to a new deal. In the 2015‚Äì16 season, UNICS was one of the favorites to win the EuroCup, but had another a failure and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. UNICS, however, qualified for the following season's EuroLeague, through the VTB League, by reaching the league's finals, although they lost in the finals to CSKA Moscow. In the 2016‚Äì17 season, UNICS, while playing in the new format of the EuroLeague, finished in a disastrous 15th place (second to last), and were eliminated in the quarterfinals of the VTB League. After that, UNICS announced that Pashutin would not return as the club's head coach for the next season. In 2017, Pashutin briefly worked for the Wisconsin Herd of the NBA G League, as an assistant coach, before becoming the head coach of Avtodor Saratov, who Pashutin then led to the VTB League playoffs. On June 7, 2018, Pashutin signed with Cant√π of the Italian top level Lega Basket Serie A (LBA). He left Cant√π in January, after a 7‚Äì10 start in the LBA, and returned to Avtodor Saratov to once again become that club's head coach.

Biography Zygmunt Krauze is an important artist of his generation: a respected composer, valued pianist, educator, organiser of musical events and a judge in many international competitions. His artistic achievements and efforts in the promotion of music have been recognised with many awards and distinctions, including the French National Order of the Legion of Honour (2007) and the Chevalier dans l‚ÄôOrdre des Arts et des Lettres (1984). In 1987 he was appointed President of the International Society for Contemporary Music and has been an honorary member of the organization since 1999. In 2011, Krauze became an honorary member of the Polish Composers' Union and a year later he was awarded the title of Coryphaeus of Polish Music in the category of Personality of the Year. =Composer= Krauze‚Äôs compositions include six operas: \\"The Star\\" (1981), \\"Balthazar\\" (2001), \\"Yvonne, Princess of Burgundy\\" (2004), \\"Polyeucte\\" (2010), \\"The Trap\\" (2011) and \\"Olympia of Gdansk\\" (2015). They were staged in such theatres as the National Theater in Mannheim, Theatre National de la Colline in Paris, Staatsoper Theater in Hamburg, Teatr Wielki in Warsaw, Opera Wroc≈Çawska, Warszawska Opera Kameralna and Th√©√¢tre du Capitole in Toulouse. In 2012 a staging of the opera ‚ÄûPolyeucte‚Äù received the award of the French Syndicat de la critique Th√©√¢tre, Musique et Danse as the best musical creation of the year. The instrumental forms employed by Krauze vary from miniatures to symphonic works engaging hundreds of musicians. In his compositions, piano is the instrument given the highest priority. As an actively performing pianist, Krauze not only composes for this instrument, but also performs his own compositions. This applies both to his early work, such as \\"Six Folk Melodies\\" (1958), through compositions resulting from experimentation with musical notation (\\"Five Unitary Piano Pieces\\" 1963, \\"Triptych\\" 1964), later experiments with the sound of the piano (\\"Stone Music\\" 1972, \\"Arabesque\\" 1983, \\"Adieu\\" 2001), theatrical games (\\"Gloves Music\\" 1972, \\"One Piano Eight Hands\\" 1973) and piano concertos (1976, 1996) where virtuosity is combined with a strong emotional charge. Other important instrumental works include: \\"Tableau Vivant\\" (1982) for chamber orchestra, \\"Blanc-rouge / Paysage d'un Pays\\" (1985) for a wind orchestra, a mandolin orchestra, an accordion orchestra and 6 percussions, \\"Quatuor Pour La Naissance\\" (1985), \\"Piano Quintet\\" (1993), \\"Canzona\\" for a chamber orchestra (2011) and \\"Memories of the East\\" (2012) for 85 Chinese instruments. Unitary music is exceptionally important in the list of Krauze‚Äôs work. As he says: ‚ÄûThe sound is individual enough to make it possible to distinguish it from the chaos of other music and other sounds. The performed composition has the ability to put time in order. (...) The beginning of each composition immediately exposes the entire range of sounds and during the piece nothing new is introduced. There will be no surprises. (...) This music creates the space for a different way of being perceived. A perfect situation would occur if the music were continually present, the listener came at the time that he or she felt convenient and left when the right moment right to do so was found.‚Äù The theoretical base of unitary art comes from the paintings of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Strzemi≈Ñski. Examples of Krauze‚Äôs unitary music are \\"Polychromy\\" (1968), \\"Pieces for Orchestra No. 1\\" (1969), \\"String Quartet No. 2\\" (1970) and \\"String Quartet No. 3\\" (1982). Music for theatre is also present among Krauze‚Äôs compositions. He has been collaborating with Jorge Lavelli, an Argentinian director living in France, for over three decades. From this collaboration grew musical illustrations to plays staged in the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise and in the Theatre National de la Colline in Paris, including \\"Polyeucte\\" by Pierre Corneille (1987), \\"Op√©rette\\" by Witold Gombrowicz (1988), \\"Macbeth\\" by Eugene Ionesco (1992), \\"Merlin\\" by Tankred Dorst (2005), \\"Oedipus Rex\\" by Sophocles (2008) and \\"El Avaro\\" by Moliere. The last, however, not least important, group of works are choral pieces and songs. The most notable among them are compositions from recent years: \\"Ball In The Opera\\" (2006) for chamber choir and 12 instruments based on Julian Tuwim's text, and \\"Voyage de Chopin\\" (2010) for a chamber choir a capella, or with an ensemble of folk instruments, based on Chopin's letters. Five Songs for Baritone and Piano (2010) is influenced by the poetry of Tadeusz R√≥≈ºewicz (2010) and \\"La Terre\\" (1995) for soprano, piano and orchestra, illustrates Yves Bonnefoy‚Äôs poems. Krauze is often invited to cooperate with foreign cultural institutions. Nearly all of his compositions are commissioned. His most important partners are: the Ministries of Culture of Poland and France, Austrian Radio, Westdeutscher Rundfunk in Cologne, S√ºdwestrundfunk Radio in Baden-Baden, the Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon, Suntory Limited in Tokyo, the National Theater in Mannheim, Radio France and Polskie Radio. Zygmunt Krauze's compositions have been performed at numerous music festivals both in Poland and abroad, as well as in renowned concert halls, such as Wiener Konzerthaus, Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Bellas Artes in Mexico City, Palais de Festival in Cannes and Beethovenshalle in Bonn. Many of his compositions have been recorded and released on records of Polskie Nagrania, DUX, ORF, Nonesuch, Thesis, Musical Observations (CP2), Collins Classics, Warner Classics, Recommended Records and EMI. =Educator= Krauze‚Äôs composition studies were completed under the supervision of Kazimierz Sikorski and his piano studies were supervised by Maria Wi≈Çkomirska at the PWSM (Higher State School of Music) in Warsaw. He obtained a French governmental scholarship and worked under the supervision of Nadia Boulanger. Soon after, he began sharing his knowledge with young students of composition and has done so until today. Since 1965 he has been conducting seminars and composition courses in Darmstadt, Basel, Paris, Tokyo, Stockholm, Jerusalem, Beijing, Hong Kong and at universities in the USA: Indiana University at Bloomington and the University of California in Santa Barbara. During 1973-1974 he worked in Berlin as an artist-in-residence invited by the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst. In 1981, he was a Visiting Professor at Yale University in New Haven and in 1996 he received the title of Eminent Corresponding Professor in Keimyung University in Daegu, South Korea. In 2002, he was appointed as a Professor of Composition at the Academy of Music in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and from 2006 he has been lecturing at the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music in Warsaw. In May 2013 Krauze was awarded the degree of Doctor honoris causa of National Music University in Bucharest. =Performer= In 1966 Zygmunt Krauze received First Prize at the Gaudeamus International Interpreters Competition (in the Netherlands) for performers of contemporary music. Since then he has performed at many of the most important stages of the world. He has been working with such conductors as Gary Bertini, Jan Krenz, Leif Segerstam, Kazimierz Kord, Kazuyoshi Akiyama, Ernest Bour, Hans Zender, Peter E√∂tv√∂s, Antoni Wit and Luca Pfaff. In 1967, he founded his ensemble Warsztat Muzyczny (Music Workshop), which he directed for 25 years. The ensemble commissioned over 100 compositions that were created by renowned composers from around the world, including: Louis Andriessen, Morton Feldman, Michael Nyman, Per N√∏rg√•rd, Mauricio Kagel, Henryk G√≥recki, Wojciech Kilar, Kazimierz Serocki and Witold Szalonek. Krauze was one of the first composers in Poland to employ new performance forms, for example, musical space compositions (installations). He collaborated with architects: Teresa Kelm in the Contemporary Gallery in Warsaw (1968, 1970), with Wies≈Çaw Nowak and Jan Muniak in Metz (1987) and in the Museum of Contemporary Art in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, as well as in the natural setting of the Eggenberg Castle in Graz (1974) and the Rohan Palace in Strasburg. =Organizer= Krauze's activity as an organiser of musical events began in 1970 when he became a member of the Repertoire Committee of the Warsaw Autumn Festival. He held this position for 11 years. In 1980, his efforts led to the revival of the Polish Society for Contemporary Music and he was its president for the next two decades. At the invitation of Pierre Boulez in 1982, he became an artistic advisor at the Institut de Recherche de Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM). In 1983-84 he hosted weekly music programs at Radio France Musique. The Polish musical community honoured Krauze with an award of the Polish Composers' Union (1998), twice he received the award of the Ministry of Culture (1989, 2005) and a \\"Gloria Artis\\" golden medal. He was one of the founding members of the Witold Lutos≈Çawski Society and for one term held the position of its president. For 13 years he has been the artistic director of the Music Gardens Foundation, which every year organises a monthlong Music Gardens Summer Festival at the Royal Castle in Warsaw. He is regularly invited to be a judge in international composition competitions throughout the world.

The charity was founded by Australian cricket player, Glenn McGrath and his English-born wife, Jane McGrath, in 2005, following Jane's initial diagnosis and recovery from breast cancer. Jane died on 22 June 2008 at the age of 42.  History  The McGrath Foundation was created after Jane McGrath was diagnosed with breast cancer, and the mission of the foundation was based on her experiences with her nurses at that time. Since 2005, the McGrath Foundation has placed 151 McGrath Breast Cancer Nurses in communities across Australia, and has supported almost 90,000 families. The majority of all McGrath Breast Care Nurses are in rural and regional areas. People experiencing breast cancer can directly contact their nearest McGrath Breast Care Nurse, whose support is then provided completely free of charge. The McGrath Foundation needs to raise approximately $390,000 to place each McGrath Breast Care Nurse in the community for a three-year period. In 2008, the Australian Government pledged $12.6 million to the McGrath Foundation to fund McGrath Breast Care Nurses in 44 communities through to June 2013. This commitment was furthered in 2013 with the announcement of a $18.5 million grant to continue funding 44 existing McGrath Breast Care Nurses in communities nationally as well as the placement of up to an additional 10 full-time equivalent McGrath Breast Care Nurse positions. This was extended for a further four years, in November 2016, confirming the positions of 57 Government-funded McGrath Breast Care Nurses until 2021.  Breast Care Nurses and Qualifications  The first goal of the McGrath Foundation is to place specialist McGrath Breast Care Nurses wherever they are needed in Australia. McGrath Breast Care Nurses are highly qualified nurses specifically train to supported families experiencing breast cancer. The role of a McGrath Breast Care Nurse is varied, and broad. From the time of diagnosis through to referrals and follow up, McGrath Breast Care Nurses play an important role in the psychosocial, emotional and physical wellbeing of patients and their families. The first tertiary-based distance education program for breast care nurses was pioneered by LaTrobe University in partnership with Cancer Council Victoria in 1997. McGrath Breast Care Nurses usually have a background in oncology, breast care or women's health and sometimes even psychology. They also require a postgraduate qualification in breast care nursing or cancer nursing, which can be studied at the Australian College of Nursinghttp://www.acn.edu.au/postgraduate and La Trobe University.http://www.latrobe.edu.au/she The McGrath Foundation offers four annual scholarships through the Australian College of Nursing.  Breast education  The second aim of the McGrath Foundation is to promote breast education among Australians. At only 31 when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer, Jane McGrath was passionate about empowering people to take control of their health by being breast aware.McGrath, Jane and Glenn. A Love For Life, Sydney, 2000. The McGrath Foundation's breast education programme was developed to ensure everyone in Australia is aware of the importance of breast health, are confident in detecting changes, are knowledgeable about the risk factors for breast cancer and are checking their breasts regularly. According to the Foundation, the programme \\"aims to empower young women in particular to look after and know their bodies, and to take action that promotes their health and wellbeing\\". It includes resources for schools, the workplace and the community with workbooks, presentations and videos available for free download from the McGrath Foundation website.  Partnerships  In 2008 the McGrath Foundation partnered with Community First Credit Union and developed the McGrath Pink Visa to raise money for McGrath Breast Care Nurses. The McGrath Foundation has a strong corporate partnership programme, and is aligned to several well-known brands that provide fundraising and awareness support.Our Corporate Partners, accessed 29.9.15, The McGrath Foundation has over 50 corporate partners including Cricket Australia, IGA Supermarket, Mount Franklin Water, Baskin-Robbins, and Bupa.http://www.mcgrathfoundation.com.au/AboutUs/OurCorporatePartners.aspx McGrath also reached out to former Ashes adversary Andrew Strauss, who played in a Pink Test himself while captaining England‚Äôs successful 2010-11 Ashes campaign, after Strauss also found himself widowed by cancer. Andrew‚Äôs wife Ruth, who he had met in Sydney, had passed away from a rare form of lung cancer on 29 December 2018 after Strauss had stepped down as England‚Äôs director of cricket to look after her. Ahead of the 2019 edition of the Ashes in England, it was announced that Day 2 of the Lord‚Äôs Test would benefit the Ruth Strauss Foundation in much the same way that Day 3 of the Sydney Test benefits the McGrath Foundation.Lord's to turn red during Ashes Test in support of Ruth Strauss Foundation by Matt Roller ESPN Cricinfo  Controversy  The McGrath Foundation used to have a relationship with the greyhound racing industry.

He is considered as one among the most illustrious Acharya of the Vaishnavite tradition and is the leader of the Vadagalai sect of the Vaishnavas. Though the title of the work suggests hundred refutations, only 66 of them are now available. Satadushani is a work of logic otherwise called as Tarka in Hindu philosophy. It is a refutation of the nirvesesha Advaita of Sankaracharya. It establishes the validity of the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja as against the Advaita of sankara. It is said that at the age of around 50 or 55 Vedanta Desika was invited by his disciples at Srirangam to engage in a polemical debate with a group of Advaitins from North India. The arguments made in the form of refutations against these men are said to be the content of this work.

Biography Halbe was born at the manor of G√ºttland (Ko≈∫liny) near Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), where he grew up. He was a member of an old family of peasants who had immigrated two centuries earlier from Westphalia. He attended the gymnasium (secondary school) at Marienburg. In 1883 he began his study of law at the University of Heidelberg. He studied history and Germanic philology at the University of Berlin, 1885-1887. He obtained his doctorate at the University of Munich in 1888. He then moved to Berlin. In both Berlin and Munich, Halbe became acquainted with the leaders of the new naturalistic movement in German literature, and became associated with the Free Stage () movement in 1889. He was strongly influenced by the association with, and the works of, Johannes Schlaf and Arno Holt. In the spring of 1890, he wrote the play Free Love (), later called Ein Verh√§ltnis (1895). He married the same year. Halbe was not entirely in accord with the Freie B√ºhne, and with consistent naturalism (see Gerhart Hauptmann), as the latter deviated considerably from his own tendencies. He published Eisgang in 1892, and then his primary work, Jugend (Youth), in 1893, which was, after Hauptmann's Die Weber, the most successful contemporary stage play in Germany. It was difficult for him to get Eisgang and Jugend performed, although Jugend got a performance on the Freie Volksb√ºhne in 1892. Jugend was especially difficult to place: famous theatre managers in Berlin (L'Arronge, Barnay, Blumenthal) refused it, but Lautenburg accepted and performed it with great success in 1893. The drama, whose unaffected and sympathetic treatment of sexual relationships made no concessions to prevailing bourgeois morality, won it the enthusiastic praise of socialist critics. Franz Mehring, the principal spokesman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany on culture, warmly welcomed Jugend and referred to Halbe, along with Gerhardt Hauptmann, as \\"one of the princes of Genius land.\\" Franz Mehring, Gesammelte Schriften, Band 12, (Dietz Verlag Berlin, 1980), p. 352. In 1917 an operatic version of Jugend, composed by Ignatz Waghalter, was premiered in Berlin at the Deutsches Opernhaus (now known as the Deutsche Oper) to great acclaim. Halbe's next play, the comedy The Tourist in America () made the impression of being witless, and his reputation rapidly declined. Constant laments were uttered by critics as to his failure to fulfill the promise of his early work. Halbe decided to move to the rural atmosphere of Kreuzlingen, on Lake Constance, in 1894. In 1895 Halbe went to Munich again, where, with Josef Ruederer, he founded the Intimate Theater for Dramatic Experiments (), in which writers and poets appeared on the stage, and was a co-founder of Munich Popular Theatre (). As a member of the Munich artist society, his circle included Otto Erich Hartleben, Frank Wedekind, Hanns von Gumppenberg, Ludwig Thoma and Eduard von Keyserling. He began writing again. The dramas Lebenswende and Mutter Erde (the latter standing with Jugend as his most famous work; a translation into English, Mother Earth, appeared in German Classics, Vol. XX, New York, 1914) and the novelle Frau Mesek are of this period. When the National Socialists seized power in January 1933, Halbe, like Gerhart Hauptmann, did not openly speak against them, and held aloof from politics. But on 22 October 1933, he signed a statement of loyalty to Adolf Hitler. As one of the few writers of significance that remained in Germany, the Nazis used him for advertising, which after the war damaged his reputation, and led to widespread rejection of his work. In 1933 and 1935 his biography Scholle und Schicksal and Jahrhundertwende were published. Halbe died in the age of 79 at his manor house in Neu√∂tting, Bavaria.

Kesava Aiyangar was a Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court of India. He practiced law for over 75 years both there and at the High Court of Madras. He was born in 1892 in the Ramanathapuram district of Tamil Nadu in India. He played an important role in the framing of the format of the Writ Petition in the courts of India. He was a widely recognized exponent of the Hindu law and was also one of the longest serving lawyers in the country. Apart from being a senior lawyer, he was also a highly respected scholar of both Sanskrit and Tamil. He served as the president of the Tamil sangam in Triplicane for over three years. Some of his works written during the time includes Parthasarathymalai, Thirupadugamalai and Andalmalai. In 1974, a book named 'Vedanta Desika's satadushani' of Srivatsankacharya was released. It carried an exhaustive introduction of high scholarly value by R. Kesava Aiyangar. But his magnum opus is the work in Tamil about Thirukkural of Thiruvalluvar called Valluvar Ullam. This highly controversial work disputed the claims of the scholars of the Dravidian Movement that Thirukkural is completely independent of the Vedic thoughts and of Hindu philosophy. It establishes with great authority that Thirukkural is indeed part of the Vedic tradition and is not, in any way, alien to it by giving extensive references from Sanskrit literature and various ancient Tamil Hindu works which mirror the thoughts of the Thirukkural. The book was highly regarded and reviewed in The Indian Express. He also authored a book titled \\"Adiyavarku Meyyan Arul\\" which expounds the philosophy of Saranagati. R. Kesava Aiyangar died on 9 November 1991 at the age of 99.  References  Category:People from Ramanathapuram district Category:1892 births Category:1991 deaths ","title":"R.

Life He entered the Society of Jesus after graduation from the Gymnasia at Bolzano and Merano. For a time he acted as professor of physics at Kalocsa and Kalksburg. In 1877 he was obliged to leave the order, for health reasons. He then studied physics at the University of Vienna and received the doctor's degree. After entering the Central Institute as volunteer in October, 1878, Pernter became assistant in 1880, and adjunct in 1884; in 1885 he also began to act as a privatdozent at the university. Relief (marble) of Pernter in the Arkadenhof of the University of Vienna In 1890 he was called to the University of Innsbruck in the capacity of extraordinary professor, and in 1893 was appointed ordinary professor of cosmic physics. In 1897 Pernter became professor at the University of Vienna, and director of the Central Meteorological Institute. He reorganized the institute and extended it considerably, increasing the staff from fifteen to thirty-one. He made it possible for the institute to take part in balloon ascents for scientific purposes. A laboratory, a printing office, a reading room, etc., were added, also a bureau for seismic observations. Instruments for recording earth tremors were set up, and the institute supervised the network of stations for the study of earthquakes, its name being changed to \\"Zentralanstalt f√ºr Meteorologie und Geodynamik\\". Pernter was also one of the founders of the \\"Leo-Gesellschaft\\" in Vienna and of the branch at Innsbruck. Works At Innsbruck he began a number of works including papers on the conditions of wind, humidity, radiation, and meteorological optics. In his most important work \\"Meteorologische Optik\\", he collected all published treatises and also supplied original papers necessary to complete certain subjects; he died before he had finished it. His German translation of Abercromby's work, \\"The weather\\", is also noteworthy. He introduced various improvements in practical weather forecasting, such as the free delivery of forecasts in the summer to all telegraph stations. During his directorate were introduced the experiments on so-called \\"weather-shooting\\", as a prevention of the dangers due to hail. These experiments created considerable interest in the agricultural circles of Austria and Italy. Pernter examined the matter carefully, and came to a conclusion that proved to be the deathblow of this practice. In the essay \\"Voraussetzungslose Forschung, freie Wissenschaft und Katholizismus\\", published during the Mommsen agitation, he sought to prove the possibility of combining strict religious faith with exact research.
