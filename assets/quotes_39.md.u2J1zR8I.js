(also known as Superfast & Superfurious) is a 2015 American action comedy film written and directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. The film is a parody of The Fast and the Furious film series. It was released in theaters and VOD on April 3, 2015, to coincide with the premiere of Furious 7. Plot Undercover police officer Lucas White enters the world of underground street racing to join a gang of street racers led by Vin Serento to get closer to a crime ring led by Los Angeles kingpin Juan Carlos de la Sol. The morning after losing a street race, Lucas goes to Vin's garage with a wrecked Smart Fortwo and lands a job as a mechanic, despite objections by Vin's friend Curtis. He also develops a relationship with Vin's sister Jordana. The next day, Lucas and Vin head to a secluded area, where they win a dance audition for de la Sol. The duo drive de la Sol's supercar to a warehouse to meet up with a gang and exchange it for a briefcase of cash, only to discover a bomb inside. They play catch with the gang until the bomb explodes on Vin's face before a shootout ensues. Vin chases after the gang leader while Lucas accidentally guns down Detective Hanover, his superior and the only one aware of his identity as an undercover cop. After the duo flee from the scene, Detective Rock Johnson and Officer Julie Canaro arrive to investigate the shootout. Meanwhile, de la Sol orders a hit on Vin following the double-cross. Back at Serento Garage, Vin and the gang discover a list of de la Sol's illegal activities through a computer in the supercar, to which they set out to steal de la Sol's secret stash of $100 million. For this heist, Vin employs the services of Rapper Cameo, Cool Asian Guy, and Model Turned Actress. At the same time, Jordana reveals to Lucas that she is pregnant with their child. Later, the gang begin their heist, but end up on the wrong street and mistakenly mug a pastor and a nun delivering bingo night money. They regroup and deduce that the secret stash is inside a Big Ass Taco restaurant. They hatch a plan to break into the vault, steal the cash, and flee to an extradition-free country with no casualties involved, except for Curtis. The next morning, Johnson and his squad raid the garage; the facility is empty, but Canaro discovers the gang's plans, which are heavily ignored by Johnson. At the Big Ass Taco, the gang realize they have been double-crossed by Curtis and engage in a shootout with de la Sol's thugs. At the last minute, Curtis is shot dead by de la Sol's henchman Cesar while protecting Vin. Using the restored Smart and Lucas' Toyota Corolla, Vin and Lucas tow the whole restaurant away. De la Sol and Cesar chase after them with Johnson and his squad in pursuit. Vin's lesbian girlfriend Michelle hands herself over to Canaro to help the gang get away. Meanwhile, de la Sol kicks Cesar out of his SUV after an argument over the climate control. Johnson kills Cesar in a shootout and stops de la Sol, but the kingpin flees after bribing the detective with a male enhancement kit. Upon hearing an explosion, Johnson heads to the abandoned restaurant and chases after the gang. He nabs Jordana and reveals to her and Vin that Lucas is an undercover cop. Lucas, instead, handcuffs Johnson to the spoiler of Jordana's Scion tC and walks away with Vin and Jordana while Johnson struggles to grab his bottle of baby oil on the ground. With the cash stowed in the trunks, Lucas and Vin agree to one more race, with Jordana's unborn baby at stake. However, de la Sol arrives, demanding the return of his money, but is run over by a squad car with Michelle and Canaro making out. Lucas, Vin, and Jordana then race off, with Vin arguing with the GPS device after it directs him to a wig shop. Cast * Alex Ashbaugh as Officer Lucas White, a parody of Brian O'Conner.

His epithet \\"deli\\" means \\"crazy\\" in Ottoman Turkish, which was ascribed to him because of his quick temper. Biography He was born in 1495 as a Bosniak as one of the early members of the Sokollu family (which would go on to spawn some of the greatest statesmen of the Empire). His exact birthplace is unknown. Some historians place it near the Glasinac Plateau near Sarajevo, while others put it more eastward, to the Podrinje region of Bosnia. His younger brother was Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha.https://web.archive.org/web/20091027141616/http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/MEHMED_PASA_SOKOLOVICH.html He was appointed sanjak-bey of Konya in 1516. He participated in the Ottoman‚ÄìMamluk War (1516‚Äì17) and personally fought in the siege of the city of Harput. He also attended the expedition to Egypt shortly after. In 1520, he took part in the suppression of the Qizilbash uprising. In 1521, he was appointed beylerbey of the Diyarbekir Eyalet, following the death of its former governor, Sakalli Mehmed Pasha, only to suppress a local rebellion in his eyalet in 1526. During his governorship of the province, he was accused of bribery and even money falsification by an unknown statesman, but the charges were never investigated. In 1531, a Safavid Empire statesman named Ulama Pasha defected to the Ottomans, however, Husrev was suspicious of his true intentions and had a conflict with him. As a result, he was deposed from his position. In 1532, he personally came to Istanbul and visited Sultan Suleyman bearing gifts with him. The Sultan brought Husrev with him during the military campaign on Austria the same year. Immediately after his return, he was named beylerbey of Allepo. In 1534, he became beylerbey of Damascus, and, in 1535 governor of Egypt. During his service in Egypt, the province saw such an economic blossoming that it even became suspicious to some. It is speculated that Husrev Pasha increased local taxes without notifying his superiors, although this too was never proved. He was named third vizier in 1536/37 and later second vizier in 1538. When the grand vizier L√ºtfi Pasha was deposed in 1541, Husrev, as second vizier expected the post for himself. He was surprised when the third vizier, Hadƒ±m Suleiman Pasha was chosen instead. When the latter died in 1544, Husrev was again expecting to get his post. However, during a divan meeting, he apparently drew a dagger and threatened then-third vizier R√ºstem Pasha. After the Sultan heard of this, he appointed R√ºstem Pasha as Grand Vizier instead. Husrev was apparently so disappointed and depressed with being skipped for the post a second time, that he didn't eat or drink for days (some sources even say weeks). As a result, he soon got ill and died.http://www.hurrem.net/node/836 He was apparently married to the Sultan's sister, Hatice Sultan, being her third husband, but was widowed by her death in 1538. Legacy Mimar Sinan erected a tomb for Husrev Pasha in 1545. During his career, Husrev Pasha built several mosques, schools, fountains and other important buildings in the areas he governed, mostly Egypt, Allepo and Damascus.

In many Chinese records, his name is given as M«é Ch√≥ngyƒ´ng (). Takdra Lukhong was born in 'phan yul (mordern Lh√ºnzhub County, Lhasa, Tibet). He served as a general during Me Agtsom's reign. After the murder of Me Agtsom by his two ministers, Lang Nyesig and Bel Dongtsab in 755, Takdra Lukhong and Shang Gyalsig quickly put down the rebellion and had rebels purged. The young prince Trisong Detsen succeeded, Takdra Lukhong was appointed nang l√∂n chen po (\\"Chief Inner Minister\\"), and became the second highest officials just below the regent Mashang Drompakye, both were followers of Bon and opponents of Buddhism. Takdra Lukhong led 200,000 troops invaded Tang China together with Shang Gyalsig in 762. The Emperor Daizong of Tang had to flee to Shanzhou (mordern Shanzhou District, Sanmenxia, Henan). They sacked Chang'an, which was the Chinese capital and one of the most richest city in the world at that time, installed a prince Li Chenghong (ÊùéÊâøÂÆè) as a puppet emperor, but had to withdrew after 15 days because the Tibetan soldiers could not stand the hot weather in Chang'an. Trisong Detsen built a pillar below the Potala Palace to commemorate his merit. The pillar was known as \\"Lhasa Zhol Pillar\\", and to this day, it still stood there. In the inscription, Trisong Detsen placed Takdra Lukhong and his clan above the law and entitled them to some special privileges. Trisong Detsen promised that he would not kill Takdra Lukhong and his descendants even if they commit serious crimes. Takdra Lukhong launched several campaign to invade China over the next few years. In 765, he invaded China again allied with Uyghur Khaganate. Many Chinese officials fled from Chang'an because they were very afraid of Tibetan troops. But later, Uyghurs broke their alliance and turn to China. Takdra Lukhong was defeated by Chinese-Uyghurs allied forces led by Guo Ziyi and had to retreat. Takdra Lukhong was a follower of Bon. Trisong Detsen decided to promote Buddhism when he was 20 years old, but was strongly opposed by Takdra Lukhong, Mashang Drompakye, and even the queen Magyal Dongkar. Mashang predicted that if the emperor promoted Buddhism, all scriptures of Bon would be abandoned, the end of the world might be nigh and the empire would collapsed. Mashang was murdered. Trisong Detsen hosted a famous debate between Buddhist and Bon supporters, and the winner would be recognised as the \\"state religion\\" in Tibet. Bon was supported by the queen and Takdra Lukhong, but finally, Trisong Detsen announced that Buddhist was the winner. Bon was declared as illegal religion, their scriptures were buried into ground or thrown into water. Takdra Lukhong refused to carry out this order, and was caned in public then exiled to Changtang. Later, Takdra Lukhong had to convert to Buddhism, and built a black pagoda in Samye as a place to offer ≈öarƒ´ra of Buddha. He regained the emperor's trust and later appointed gung l√∂n chen po (\\"Chief Minister\\"), the highest official position in Tibet. According to New Book of Tang, Takdra Lukhong invaded Tang China in 778. He led a troop advance to the north, and completedly defeated Uyghurs in Tian Shan. In this battle, Uyghurs lost their main force of the army, leading their khaganate's decline and collapse. In 792, The whole East Turkestan was occupied by Tibet.

Career Her commander in 1799 was Captain Lambert. On 28 January 1801 HMS Bordelais was west of Barbados when she encountered two French brigs and a French schooner. They gave chase but then Bordelais turned. In the short engagement that followed she captured the larger of the brigs, Curieuse, which sank within an hour or so of her capture. The two other French vessels escaped early in the engagement. Reportedly, the French \\"brig\\" that escaped was Mutine, of sixteen 6-pounder guns and 156 men under the command of J. Reybaud (or Raybaun), and the French schooner was Esp√©rance, of six 4-pounder guns and 52 men under the command of Captain Haywood.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp.136-7. Loss In 1803, Mutine, under the command of Lieutenant de vaisseau Reybaud, sailed from Gibraltar and M√°laga, spain, for the French Antilles.Fonds, Vol. 1, p.286. The crossing took 38 days, during which Mutine took two prizes.Barrey (1907), p.54. Once in the French Antilles, Mutine sailed from Port-de-Paix to Santiago de Cuba. At 1 p.m. on 12 August 1803, Racoon sighted a what she identified as a brig coming along shore that met up with a schooner that had been avoiding the British all day. At 3 p.m. the two came up together, but Racoon held back. Then at 4:15 p.m. the brig hoisted French colours and opened fire on Racoon. Racoon and the brig exchanged broadsides, with Racoons fire bringing down most of the brigs rigging. The brig ran on shore on the rocks in a small bay, where she struck her colours. After some maneuvering, Racoon fired a broadside from her other side to try to destroy her. After about half an hour, the brig raised her colours again. Racoon made several passes, firing on the brig, which lost her mainmast near sunset, and fell on her side. The brig sent her crew ashore in boats while Racoon watched all night. On the morning of 13 August, it was clear that the brig was a complete wreck, having lost her masts and being full of water. Commander Austin Bissell, of Racoon, decided not to permit Racoons sailing master to take a boat and some men to the brig to burn her because there were too many armed men on shore who would fire on any boarding party. Also, Racoon was undermanned, her two lieutenants and 42 men being away in the prizes she had taken in July. During the engagement, the French schooner made her escape despite the efforts of Lieutenant Wright to capture her, using a prize that Racoon had captured earlier. The destroyed brig turned out to be Mutine. Citations and references Citations References *Barrey, Ph. (1907; 1st trimester) \\"Notice sur les Constructeurs de Navires Havrais\\".

She was designed and built by Robert Lee, a Master Shipwright at Chatham Dockyard and launched in September 1694. William and Mary, like other Royal yachts, was generally used as a transport for senior military, political, and diplomatic figures, as well as for the Royal family. She frequently carried William III or his officers and staff to Holland when there were crises warranting their presence.Major (2012). In 1697 Tsar Peter the Great visited western Europe. William III sent to bring Peter from Holland to England. On Yorks arrival at the Thames, Peter transferred to William and Mary, and in her sailed up the river to London Bridge, where he alighted to reach the Palace of Whitehall. From 1695 to 1701, William and Marys captain was Sir William Saunderson. In 1702 Captain William Robinson replace Sanderson. Robinson was in command when she participated in the battle of Malaga in 1704. He remained in command until January 1713, when she was paid off and sent to Deptford Dockyard for repairs, which were completed by December 1714.Winfield (2010). In 1719 William and Mary was recommissioned under Captain John Guy, who remained her commander to 1720. In 1721 Captain William Moses replaced Guy, and remained in command until May 1727. On 4 May 1727 Captain Timothy Brett replaced Guy. She returned to Deptford for major repairs that took place between February 1736 and May 1737. Brett died on 3 May 1739, and his replacement that year was Captain William Parry. Between May and August 1742 William and Mary underwent smaller repairs at Deptford. More extensive repairs followed between September 1746 and May 1747. On 7 February 1753, Captain John Moore replaced Parry. Moore remained in command until 1755. Perhaps William and Marys most notable voyage occurred on 7 August 1761 when she was one of squadron of six royal yachts ‚Äî (renamed Royal Charlotte), , , and ‚Äî that accompanied by six ships-of-war, sailed from Harwich to Cuxhaven under the command of Admiral of the Fleet Lord Anson to embark Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, future wife of King George III, at Stade. The flotilla arrived back at Harwich on 6 September after a ten-day voyage, having endured westerly gales that three times blew them over to the Norwegian coast, twice almost wrecking them. From December 1763 to August 1765 William Norton commanded William and Mary. However, from January 1764 until August 1765 she was again at Deptford, where Adam Hayes completely rebuilt her. William and Mary then had a number of commanders. Her captain between 1779-82 George Young. Captain George Vanderput recommissioned her in June 1783. She then underwent a major repair and coppering at a private yard on the Thames, something which took until 1786. Captain Charles Buckner assumed command in 1787 and remained in command until 1792. The next year she was paid off. Fate She was the oldest ship in the Navy at the time of her decommissioning around 1800.

Hall was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1999.http://www.the- scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/42883/title/Prominent-Cell-Biologist- Dies/ Early life and education Hall was born in Barnsley. He earned his BA in chemistry from Oxford University. He began his studies for a PhD at Oxford, but after two months he followed his major professor Jeremy R. Knowles to Harvard University, where he earned a PhD in biochemistry in 1977.In Memoriam: Alan Hall, Pioneer in Rho GTPases and Chair of Cell Biology at Sloan-Kettering He then took postdoctoral fellowships in molecular biology at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Zurich. Career and research Hall's PhD was on the enzymology of B-lactamase, which led to his first paper being published in Nature in 1976. He used strains of E. Coli with mutated B-lactamase, an antibiotic resistance enzyme, and assayed their activity in the presence of Benzylpenicillin and Cephalosporin C. Direct selection on these mutants allowed catalytic properties of B-lactamase to be identified and allowed structure-function relationships of the enzyme to be further researched. In 1981 he went to work at Institute for Cancer Research in London, where he stayed for 12 years. His work, in collaboration with his colleague and close friend Christopher Marshall, made seminal contributions to our understanding of cell signalling in animal cells, in particular the role of Rho and Ras small GTPases in regulating a variety of cellular functions such as proliferation, morphology and migration. In 1982, Hall helped identify transforming sequences in human sarcoma cells lines at the Institute for Cancer Research in London. DNA from a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line and a fibrosarcoma cell line transformed a NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line. After injection into mice, tumors started to form in as little as 10 days. Next, the transforming activities of the rhabdomyosarcoma and fibrosarcoma cell lines were measured after being digested with an array of endonucleases. Further DNA testing showed that the transforming sequences in the two cancer cell lines were the same, and the gene was later characterised as N-ras, a member of the Ras gene family. In 1986, Hall helped uncover properties of the human p21 protein, which is encoded by N-ras. GTPase activity of different mutant forms of p21, one cloned from a patient with myeloblastic leukaemia and one derived from in vitro mutagenesis, was measured. Results showed no correlation between the wild-type or mutant N-ras p21's GTPase activity and transforming potential. These findings were published in Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB). Alan Hall showed the specificity of Rho in the stimulation of focal adhesions and stress fibres formation in fibroblasts in the presence of extracellular factors in 1992. He first realised that the addition of bovine fetal calf serum (FCS) to Swiss 3T3 cells increased the polymerisation of actin and assembly of stress fibres. The immunofluorescence following the increase of vinculin and talin, two cytoskeletal proteins, at the intracellular face of the plasma membrane with Val14rhoA microinjection showed the association of focal adhesions with the end of the new stress fibres. After size fractionation of FCS and analysis of the lipids that bound to serum albumin, the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was found to be responsible for the serum activity that induced stress fibre formation. The inhibition of Rho by C3 transferase ribosylation resulted in an inhibition of focal adhesion and stress fibre assembly, but had no effect on membrane ruffling. These findings were published in Cell and cited over 4000 times. In parallel with this experiment, Hall showed that the presence of Rac, another Ras-related GTP- binding protein, is implicated in the regulation of the actin organisation in presence of extracellular growth factors. Immunofluorescence and antibody techniques were used to localise the mutant V12rac1 protein after being microinjected into the cytoplasm of confluent serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells. The comparison with the normal cells showed that Rac1 stimulates actin filament production at the membrane, pinocytosis, and membrane ruffling. The inhibition of endogenous Rac function by mutants N17rac and V12rac1 prevented growth factor-induced membrane ruffling. In addition, the inactivation of Rho protein by ADP-ribosylation in Rac1 microinjection reduced the formation of actin stress fibres. Hall concluded that Rac and Rho are complementary for polymerised actin organisation. Indeed, Rho-dependent response is stimulated by the action of growth factors on Rac protein. In 1993 he moved to University College London, where he helped to create a new MRC centre for molecular cell biology. In 2000, he became director of that program. In 2002, Alan Hall discerned the role of Gaq in Rho signalling pathways. Prior to this publication, there were conflicting reports as to the role of Gaq in cell signalling via Rho; some said that it was not able to induce Rho activation, and some said that it could. Using immunoblotting techniques, Hall showed that activation of endogenous Gaq via G protein-coupled receptors (GCPRs) could in fact induce activation of Rho, and had similar results when directly expressing activated Gaq. It was already known that other Ga proteins could induce Rho activation (i.e. Ga13 activates p115 Rho GEF, which in turn activates Rho), but it was also known that Gaq does not activate p115 Rho GEF, and therefore must act via an alternate, unknown mechanism. Two years later, he moved to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center as chair of the cell biology program. In 2005, there was an abundance of activators and targets of the Rho pathway that had been identified, yet very little investigation into the way in which specificity of the pathway is maintained. It was known at this point that several identified Rho targets were structurally similar to scaffold proteins, which have been shown in the past to mediate interaction specificity in other pathways. Hall used immunoprecipitation assays to show that CNK1, a scaffold protein-like target of Rho, interacts with two Rho- specific GEFs (Net1 and p115RhoGEF) and two kinases of the JNK MAP kinase pathway (MLK2 and MKK7). He then determined that CNK1 acts together with these four targets to activate the JNK MAP kinase pathway, but not other Rho- activated pathways. This led to the conclusion that CNK1 couples specific Rho exchange factors to the JNK MAP kinase pathway, providing specificity. In the same year, Hall investigated the role of the small GTPase Ral in neurite branching. After microinjection of cortical and sympathetic neurons with active and dominant-negative Ral, the staining of the cells with antibodies showed that the increases in neurite branching was directly linked to the presence of active Ral. Further evidence of the importance of Ral was provided when cortical neurons were depleted of endogenous RalA and RalB isoforms by RNA interference (RNAi) and showed a decrease in the branching. By plating SCG on plastic dishes in presence of different substrates, Hall realised that Ral was activated by laminin to induce this branching. In fact, Ral-dependent branching implicated the phosphorylation of growth-associated protein GAP-43. Finally, Ral mutants unable to bind to their specific effector proteins showed that RalA and RalB isoforms promote branching through exocyst complex and phospholipase D respectively. In 2010, Hall analysed a number of Rho signalling pathways, which regulate the formation of apical junctions in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. Downregulation of RhoA in the HBE cell lines using siRNAs showed a lack of apical junction formation in contrast with the controls. The siRNAs that targeted RhoA had no effect on other members of the Rho family. Further analysis showed that PRK2, a direct target of Rho, is required for the formation of apical junctions. Mutational variants of PRK2 were used to discover that although initial formation of pre-apical junctions isn't blocked, the maturation process into true apical junctions is prevented. Hall's research has had wide implications across human health and disease, particularly cancer. In addition, a generation of cell biologists was educated and trained under his supervision across two continents. Honours and awards In 1993, Alan Hall was awarded the Feldberg Foundation Prize for his work on the role GTP-binding proteins played on signal transduction pathways. His work in 2005 on the regulation of adhesion, migration and polarity of the cell cytoskeleton was awarded the Louis Jeantet Prize for Medicine. Later that year he won the Novartis Medal for his work with Rho GTPases role in cell behaviour. The Canada Gairdner International Award (2006) was awarded to him for the discovery of Rho GTPases that play a role in cytoskeleton arrangement and cell migration and its application to cancerous cells.

It is also known as the HB Sales Building. It was designed by Frank Longland and built in 1912 by George Edward Day. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 April 1999.  History  This single-storeyed brick building was erected in the second half of 1912 for Smith and Balls' Acme Engineering Works, on land acquired by Sarah Balls, widow, in the same year. It was built during the period of expansion, rather than diversification, which characterised the rapidly growing Queensland economy from 1903 to 1914, and illustrates the continued early 20th century development of Frog's Hollow - the ground between George and Edward Streets, bounded on the west by Elizabeth Street and on the east by Alice Street - as a commercial and light-industrial precinct. Low- lying and swampy, Frog's Hollow had been farmed by convict labour during the penal settlement of the 1820s and 1830s, and in the 1840s and 1850s was sparsely settled with cottages erected on the higher ground. In the busy post- Separation decades of the 1860s and 1870s, an ad hoc process of land filling was undertaken as Frog's Hollow became more densely populated by the working classes, and shophouses, house-workshops, small factories or workshops, boarding houses and hotels were erected. During the boom years of the 1880s, these residences and small workshops were replaced gradually with large and imposing commercial and industrial premises, as Frog's Hollow, conveniently located near the wharves along Eagle Street and Petrie Bight, emerged as Brisbane's principal light-industrial and warehousing precinct. Factories and workshops specialising in clothing, footwear, saddlery, furniture, building, printing, brewing, milling, confectionery or biscuit manufacture, coachmaking, ship- fitting and metal-working, as well as substantial importer and manufacturer warehousing, either were established or expanded. By the late 1880s, engineering and ironfounding firms were particularly prominent in the Edward-Alice-Margaret Street precinct, and included Smellie & Co.; Smith, Forrester & Co.; Harvey Sargeant & Co.; and Overend & Co. Development of Frog's Hollow slowed during the Depression years of the 1890s, but resumed in the first two decades of the 20th century. Smith and Balls' 1912 engineering works contributed to this early 20th century consolidation of Frog's Hollow as a light-industrial precinct. Built next to Watson Brothers Building (1887), a Margaret Street plumbers, gasfitters and galvanised iron and lead works, the Acme Engineering Works was appropriately and conveniently located in the metal-working precinct concentrated around Alice, Margaret and lower Edward Streets. Brisbane architect Frank Longland called tenders in June 1912 for the erection of brick premises in Margaret Street for the Acme Engineering Works. The successful tenderer was George Edward Day of New Farm. Longland, formerly an articled pupil of former colonial architect FDG Stanley, built up a small but successful architectural practice in Brisbane spanning the years 1893 to 1924. He was a Councillor of the Queensland Institute of Architects 1894-95, and was made a Fellow by 1913. Some of Longland's 1890s works have been identified - principally small commissions - and the Acme Engineering Works building in Margaret Street is one of his few known 20th century works to survive. He appears to have been a progressive architect who followed the latest in contemporary European architectural trends, his work ranging from the freestyle facade of the Acme Engineering Works (1912) to the restrained functionality of the 1918 Howes Brothers produce store at the corner of Petrie Terrace and Sexton Street. Of functionalist appearance in contrast to similar buildings of the period, the latter seems remarkably modern in outlook. By 1913, Smith and Balls' Acme Engineering Works, consulting and marine engineers, coppersmiths, brass and iron moulders, blacksmiths and general engineers, had occupied their Margaret Street building. Acme Engineering Works, managed by Alex J Smith, had operated previously from 37 Charlotte Street, and specialised in milk condenser work. Smith appears to have gone into partnership with Mrs Sarah Balls, of the Stock Exchange Hotel in Queen Street, to facilitate the move to Margaret Street. The firm ceased business , and in October that year title to the property was transferred to Charles Joshua Jeays, Arthur Vivian Jeays and Albert Frederick Jeays. Charles Joshua Jeays, builders' and plumbers' supplies, had occupied the site by 1930, and remained there until . After the Second World War, the building is understood to have been occupied by Gardiner Batteries, whose principal business was located in O'Reilly's Buildings, Margaret Street, just south of the former Acme Engineering Works. In 1958 HB Sales, a chemical wholesale company, occupied the building. The property passed out of the Jeays family in 1963, and Orb Holdings Pty Ltd acquired title in 1978. The building was being used as a specialist internet cafe, The Hub, at the time of its heritage listing in 1999. By 2012, it was leased by a cycling store; however, it was vacant and for lease in October 2013.  Description  Adjoining Watson Brothers Building in Margaret Street, the Acme Engineering Works is a single-storeyed brick workshop with an early galvanised iron extension at the rear. The front freestyle facade is symmetrical around a wide central opening with flanking arched double-hung sash windows. All three openings in the front facade currently have individual canvas awnings. At each edge of the facade a pilaster extends up to the parapet. Situated on each pilaster is a downpipe whose rainwater head has the date 1912 cast onto it. Between the pilasters above the central opening is a plain rendered portion and above this the name HB SALES in raised lettering. The parapet has a raised centrepiece separated from the side pilasters by inverted semi-circular cut-outs. The centrepiece consists of a dentilled cornice supporting an unusual triangular pediment with a curved top, behind which a gable roof extends the length of the building. A water closet projects to one side at the rear of the brick building, behind which is the galvanised iron extension, extant by 1913. Internally there is an early mezzanine level which has been extended toward the front of the building, with a new stair.  Heritage listing  The Acme Engineering Works was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Acme Engineering Works erected in 1912 during Queensland's first 20th century boom, is important in demonstrating the evolution of Frog's Hollow as the principal warehousing and light-industrial sector of Brisbane's central business district, which was sustained from the second half of the 19th century through to the early decades of the 20th century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Acme Engineering Works demonstrates several rare aspects of Brisbane's cultural heritage, being a rare extant example of a light-industrial workshop surviving in the Brisbane central business district and one of the few identified 20th century works by Brisbane architect Frank Longland. The freestyle facade was, and remains, a rare design for an industrial building in Brisbane. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a small-scale brick Federation-era workshop, designed to impress, but with economy. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Acme Engineering Works is significant for its streetscape contribution to Margaret Street. The decorative freestyle facade remains intact, and although the face-brickwork has been painted, retains its aesthetic appeal.

His father died 6 December 1802, and his widow moved to Providence with her son. Bucklin attended the town's public schools. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed to early architect-builder John Holden Greene, working there for seven years. In 1822, at the age of 21, he established a partnership with William Tallman (d.1862). The firm of Tallman & Bucklin was a design-build firm, similar to Greene's business.Representative Men and Old Families of Rhode Island. 1908. in 1846, 20-year-old Thomas A.

By 1880 he had taken his son, James A. Bucklin (1840-1901), as a partner in J. C. Bucklin & Son. Although son James largely took over the practice, he remained active until his death in September 1890. The office was succeeded by J. A.

Bucklin was a member of the Squantum Association and the Providence Athenaeum, and was considered \\"a great reader of good books\\". He was also a member of the First Light Infantry. Legacy Despite having fallen into relative obscurity, Bucklin was a very prominent designer in Providence from the 1840s to the 1870s. He designed at least half a dozen Westminster Street office buildings, as well as several more in other parts of downtown.

Most country radio stations usually play only music which has been officially released to country radio by record labels. The largest owners of country music stations in the United States include iHeartMedia, Cumulus Media, CBS Radio, and Townsquare Media. There are more radio stations in the United States specializing in country music (about 2,100 stations) than any other format, out of a total of about 15,000 radio stations in the US. Country radio stations are very influential in the country music industry, compared to other genres of music. Until 2012, only country radio stations were counted in the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart's airplay component, and from 1990 to 2012, country radio was the sole arbiter of a song's position on that chart; the same magazine's Country Airplay chart remains limited solely to country radio stations. Country radio stations come in a wide variety of formats. The most common is mainstream country, which follows the basic format of contemporary hit radio in that the current top 40 hits on the country record charts serve as the core playlist, with select recurrents from the past 15 years rounding out the format. Hot country stations focus almost exclusively on top 40 country hits, with occasional acoustic pop hits from outside the country genre. Adult country formats follow a pattern similar to the adult contemporary music format: a few hits, while mostly focused on songs in recurrent rotation from the past 30 years and maintaining a sound similar to that of mainstream country outlets. Classic country stations, increasingly rare in their original form, play only older music; much like other \\"classic\\" formats such as oldies/classic hits and classic rock, the eras from which classic country has drawn its music has slowly drifted in real time. Traditional country uses classic country as its base while maintaining some current or recurrent hits that fit the classic country sound. Americana is a loosely defined country radio format that is less focused on hits and thus more willing to play bluegrass, alt-country and regional acts whose commercial performance would not warrant being played on a mainstream country station; Americana stations do not always self-identify as country. In terms of driving the mainstream popularity of hit country songs within the music industry, \\"country radio\\" typically encompasses only mainstream country and hot country stations. United Kingdom There have been a number of attempts to provide country radio in the UK marketplace, though not all have been successful. In contrast to other English-speaking nations such as Canada, Australia and the United States, country has typically been less popular as a genre in the UK (particularly in England; the Celtic realms of Northern Ireland and Scotland have been somewhat more receptive, as the country genre has extensive roots in Celtic folk music) and attempts at all-country radio there have been more sporadic. Country 1035 went on air in September 1994 as London's first full-time country music station. The AM station was never hugely successful financially, and passed through several owners, becoming RTL Country, Ritz Country and then Mean Country, eventually ending up with Avtar Lit, who relaunched the station as easy listening/country hybrid Easy Radio London in 2002. The following year, the AM frequency became Asian talk station Kismat Radio, with the Easy service continuing on DAB only until ceasing altogether in 2008. Radio Clyde launched digital country music service 3C on DAB in various areas (though never London) in the early 00s, with national carriage on the Freeview digital TV service subsequently added. Following the acquisition of Clyde parent SRH by the Emap group (now Bauer Radio) in 2005, 3C was shut down in March 2007, Clyde 1 taking its place on Freeview to see out the final year of the contract. Chris Country, playing US and UK country music, launched online in 2013, and since 2016 has been gathering carriage on DAB, mostly on small-scale multiplexes though also on some full local muxes including in London. In some areas Chris Country uses, or has switched to, the DAB+ broadcast standard. In spring 2015, Bauer returned to country for the first time since the closure of 3C when their Northern Ireland station Downtown Radio, off the back of their successful weekly country strand, launched a digital service, Downtown Country, via DAB across NI (and UK-wide online).RadioToday, March 2015 In February 2020, Downtown removed country music shows from its FM and principal DAB frequencies, moving these shows to broadcast solely on AM and Downtown Country.RadioToday.co.uk, 2020-02-03 In March 2019, Global launched an online country music stream under the Smooth Radio brand, with the commencement of Smooth Country on the Smooth website and Global Player app.RadioToday, 1 March 2019 The service was not carried on terrestrial radio platforms until being relaunched as a DAB radio service in a number of locations on 3 September 2019. On 5 April 2019, Bauer Radio launched Country Hits Radio, a new digital country music station, on DAB radio in several areas (largely replacing KissFresh) and nationally online. The Saturdays' Una Healy is among the presenters, with Baylen Leonard - who joined from Chris County - launching the new station at 10am on 5 April. It appears that the station will coexist with the existing Northern Ireland-focused Downtown Country operation, with Greatest Hits Radio replacing KissFresh on DAB in NI.

Early life Frank Longland was born on 22 September 1870 in Brisbane, the son of David Ferdinand Longland and his wife Charlotte (n√©e Sutton). Career Frank Longland was an articled pupil of former Queensland Colonial Architect Francis Drummond Greville Stanley. Longland built up a small but successful architectural practice in Brisbane spanning the years 1893 to 1924. He was a Councillor of the Queensland Institute of Architects 1894-95, and was made a Fellow by 1913. Some of Longland's 1890s works have been identified ‚Äì principally small commissions ‚Äì and the Acme Engineering Works building in Margaret Street is one of his few known 20th century works to survive. He appears to have been a progressive architect who followed the latest in contemporary European architectural trends, his work ranging from the freestyle facade of the Acme Engineering Works (1912) to the restrained functionality of the 1918 Howes Brothers produce store at the corner of Petrie Terrace and Sexton Street. Of functionalist appearance in contrast to similar buildings of the period, the latter seems remarkably modern in outlook. Later life Frank Longland died in Brisbane on 16 July 1934.

The conservation and restoration of musical instruments is performed by conservator-restorers who are professionals, properly trained to preserve or protect historical and current musical instruments from past or future damage or deterioration. Because musical instruments can be made entirely of, or simply contain, a wide variety of materials such as plastics, woods, metals, silks, and skin, to name a few, a conservator should be well-trained in how to properly examine the many types of construction materials used in order to provide the highest level or preventive and restorative conservation. The conservation and restoration of musical instruments presents an issue that is unlike any faced elsewhere in the art world. Unlike paintings, sculptures and photographs, musical instruments are functional objects that cannot be fully appreciated through their visual aspects alone - much of their artistic value comes from the sound that they are able to produce. It is because of this that before beginning any treatments, determination should be made as to whether the piece will be available for display only or if there is intention to be able to perform with the instrument, as making an instrument available for performance may require the replacement of original pieces such as strings and drumheads, thus raising ethical issues relating to how much of the original object should be replaced and to what end. Background Musical instrument conservation, at least by the date of the earliest reference acquired, originates from 1862 when ‚Äúa letter was written by Antonio Stradivari, who not only repaired his own instruments but also those of other makers, for Count Cesare Castelbarco about how to conserve his many Stradivari instruments.‚Äù There are many similarities between musical instrument conservation and art work protection. Like a conservator working to restore the color saturation of the water lilies in a Claude Monet painting, conservators should keep in mind the instrument maker's integrity when cleaning or restoring any type of musical instrument (for example, luthiers create guitars and violins for guitarists or violinists), as well as the standardized policies or ethics of art conservation. According to the Code of Ethics, ‚ÄúII. All actions of the conservation professional must be governed by an informed respect for the cultural property, its unique character and significance, and the people or person who created it.‚Äù Both art conservation and musical instrument conservation require a lot of attention to detail, patience, and respect for the item or artist(s). The conservator should also be highly trained in the medium in which these items were created. For example, wood preservation or acrylic on canvas. In general, art works are static and not moving whereas musical instruments are basically an active art tool for producing the sounds notated on sheet music in various keys or tempos. Although some art objects may have more than one use and move periodically from its home institution to another museum on loan (besides providing cultural satisfaction), instruments are subject to: travel or wear and tear consistently due to continual playing. Musical instruments create art by producing sound because the human hand touches their skins, strings, bows, fret board or keys. Musical instruments are generally used on a regular basis, during recitals and concerts by all levels of musicians. An instrumentalist should keep in mind how to play their instrument carefully so that they can preserve the integrity of the instrument. That being stated, each musician performs with an instrument differently, creating their own personality and take on the capabilities of that particular instrument (ex. Louis Armstrong and his trumpet). In a sense, the partnership between instrumentalist and instrument defines them both. ‚ÄúPlayers demand certain kinds of physical responses from an instrument, and players and listeners alike have certain preferences about the tone produced.‚Äù Despite how long musical instruments should last, it is important to try to maintain their playable conditions as long as possible. Similarly to automobiles that have been used on a daily basis over the years, musical instruments do not sound the same or work in the same manner that they once did when they were new. Parts wear out and at times just need to be replaced. On a side note, the average lifespan of instruments depends on the classification of them: ‚Äúwoodwinds or brass instruments last about twenty years, while pianos last about 100 years, and string instruments for a maximum of 200 years.\\" With proper conservation techniques used on instruments, they will be able to last longer than their projected lifespans. Some music composed during the 18th century by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was for the harpsichord, and if this music is to be historically understood it must be heard on an instrument of the original time period. The Smithsonian has maintained a harpsichord that some of the resident curators can periodically play. This can be seen via the short YouTube video entitled, ‚ÄúPlay it Again.‚Äù Although these Mozart compositions could be played on a piano, they would not sound the same as a harpsichord when a musician performs the piece. Late 19th Century Rosewood Clarinet Environmental obligations exist for both musical instrument creators and conservators. This is because the materials used in instrument creation, like wood, can be on the endangered species list. ‚ÄúMany species of rosewood and ebony are endangered, but the wood is still easily purchased.‚Äô ‚ÄòSome timbers and materials used by luthiers has legal restrictions, especially when crossing international boundaries.‚Äù There appears to be a mission to conserve both art or cultural artifacts and environmental conservation in the realm of musical instrument conservation.  Classification Systems  In 1914, the Curt Sachs and Erich Moritz von Hornbostel's system for the Classification of Musical Instruments was created. It is divided into five main sections with several subcategories. Understanding how an instrument is intended to be used and which of these categories it falls into is vital information if a conservator is to determine how a piece will need to be repaired in order for it to be safely playable. Additionally, understanding the construction of an instrument and where it is experiencing tension will help to determine the safest methods of storage. The five main sections are defined as: Idiophones - Idiophones are instruments that rely on the body of the instrument to create and resonate sound. Most commonly constructed of metal, a conservator will need to examine the metal for cracks and tarnish that will negatively impact the sound and structural integrity of the instrument. # Concussion - Instruments that create sound when struck against a similar object such as castanets # Friction - Instruments that create sound when rubbed such as a glass harp # Percussion - Instruments that create sound when struck such as a triangle # Plucked - Instruments that create sound when plucked such as a harp # Scraped - Instruments that create sound when scraped such as a washboard # Shaken - Instruments that create sound when shook such as a maraca # Stamping - Instruments that create sound when stamped against a hard surface such as a tap shoes # Stamped - The sound that the surface itself makes when something is stamped against it Membranophones - Membranophones are instruments that have a membrane that is stretched over a structure, often wood or metal, and struck or rubbed to produce a sound. The subcategories are largely determined by the shape of the structure that the membrane is stretched over. For many historic membranophones to become playable again, a conservator may have ti weigh replacing the membrane of the piece. # Kettle drums # Tubular drums # Friction drums # Mirlitons - This subsection is unique to the membranophones category as it relies on air passing over the membrane, rather than it being struck. The most common example of a mirliton is a Kazoo # Frame drums/Pot drums/Ground drums Chordophones - Chordophones are instruments that use vibrating strings, which are most commonly stretched across a metal or wooden structure, to create sound. Similar to the membranes used on membranophones, the strings that are used on chordophones may need to be replaced if an instrument is to be performed with. A conservator will need to examine the structure of the instrument to see if stress cracks from the tension of the strings have begun to develop. # Musical Bows # Harps # Lyres # Lutes # Zithers Aerophones - Aerophones are instruments that require air passing through, or across, them to create sound. Most commonly constructed of wood or metal, a conservator will need to examine the innards for mold or debris that will prohibit air from passing easily through the instrument. # Brasswinds - The most commonly known is the trumpet # Woodwinds - The most commonly known is the flute # Free-Reed - The most commonly known is the accordion # Free - Free instruments are unique to the aerophone category due their reliance on air passing around the instrument, rather than through it. The most common example is a whip when it is cracked. Electrophones - Instruments that require electricity to be amplified and heard  Preventive Conservation  Richard Newman of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston calls preventive conservation the \\"ultimate goal\\" of conservation-restoration. Conservators should consider the common agents of deterioration when planning the preventive conservation measures of musical instruments. = Physical forces = Musical instruments are very fragile and should be handled carefully to avoid shock. Musical instruments in museums and other galleries should be safely encased. For musical instruments that ‚Äúbelong to a study or teaching collection, or‚Ä¶ simply be in a drawer that experiences a great deal of in-and-out movement during examination of other specimens,‚Äù they are more at risk of being damaged because more people are interacting with them. Human interaction should be limited. Recommendations include: * ‚ÄúAvoid placing high tension on stringed (including keyboard) instruments.‚Äù * ‚ÄúAvoid sudden increases or decreases in string tension.‚Äù * ‚ÄúMove pianos only on dollies and when you have enough people to do the job comfortably.‚Äù = Fire = Fire is one of the biggest natural threats to musical instrument collections. Instruments should be housed in facilities with functioning fire detectors and sprinkler systems. Wooden instruments are particularly vulnerable to fire. Museums or other institutions that have musical instruments in their collections should work with local fire stations to plan salvage procedures. = Pests = Dead-Wood Borer Moth (Scolecocampa liburna) Many instruments are made of wood, therefore wood eating insects could damage them if left in a dark, damp, and drafty space. A careful way to get rid of the infestation is through ‚Äúasphyxiation by carbon dioxide or nitrogen [because they] are the preferred methods, although some work still has to be done on the effects of changes in moisture content of artifacts during treatment.‚Äù Additionally, a conservator may choose to place an instrument in a freezer for a period of time as another method of pest eradication. Basic cleanliness of storage areas prevents larger infestations such as rats or roaches. = Light = Direct sunlight is harmful to musical instruments. Light makes colors fade and also causes the rapid break down of organic materials, such as wood and membranes that are commonly used in many instruments. It is generally best not to place any artifact in a collection in direct light, whether it is natural or artificial. UV filters over windows are efficient in protecting instruments housed near natural light. Artificial light should be limited to 8 foot-candles. ‚ÄúLight damage is a commonly identified problem in collections, and is the subject of vast literature.‚Äù = Incorrect relative humidity = Since musical instruments are compiled of many organic materials such as: wood, metal, or plastic; it makes it difficult to preserve them if they are constantly on display in a museum. ‚ÄúPaper, leather, wood, natural fibers, and other organic materials absorb moisture; if they are kept in non-climate-controlled environments, serious conservation problems arise\\" These dilemmas could include corrosion or buckling. Therefore, musical instruments should be kept in RH controlled display cases and storage areas. Areas of vulnerability include joints and adhesives. Instruments that rely on the flow of air and breath are also at risk, as ‚Äú‚Ä¶fluctuations or sudden changes in temperature or humidity may cause irreversible structural damage, especially in a woodwind, (because of warm, wet breath) or in a stringed instrument or drum, where the vibrating element is under tension‚Äù. Recommendations include: * ‚ÄúKeep instruments in rooms with relative humidity at about 50%.‚Äù = Thieves and vandals = Institutions that house musical instrument collections or private collectors should be vigilant of the threat of thieves and vandals. Proper security systems should be in place, and security personnel hired to monitor any instruments housed in public places. This is particularly important if the musical instruments are still in playable condition and are played by members of the public. = Water = Water is another common natural threat to musical instruments. Flood and rain waters can compromise instruments, especially wooden instruments that can become warped and retain humidity after getting wet because they are moisture dependent. Instruments made of metal or other alloy materials can also be damaged by water. The reaction of water and metal is one of the biggest issues faced by musical instrument conservators. Recommendations include: * ‚ÄúClear the moisture from wind instruments immediately after they are played.‚Äù = Pollutants = Pollutants are an unavoidable environmental threat, especially for musical instruments housed in urban areas. Conservators should be well versed in the pollutants in their area and how they will affect musical instrument conservation. HVAC systems should be up to date and filtering clean air. Conservators should always wear gloves to prevent oil from transferring from hands to the surface of polish or painted instruments. Recommendations include: * Preserve the natural patina on brass instruments; don't handle them with bare hands or polish them.‚Äù * ‚ÄúDo not oil or polish the surfaces of a wooden instrument.‚Äù = Incorrect temperature = Instruments, whether played or not, should be kept at 68 degrees F. If a space is too warm, wooden instruments may retain moisture from the air and warp, which can eventually lead to cracks in the structure. Even small fissures in the wood can greatly impact the sound that the instrument is able to produce. Recommendations include: * ‚ÄúIf you play wooden-bore wind instruments, warm them up and play them in gradually.‚Äù = Dissociation = Preventive conservation measures should be periodically reviewed by conservators to ensure up to date methods are being practiced. Conservation Practices Musical instruments are often very fragile and complex objects that should be conserved both externally and internally. When deciding the course of a conservation treatment, conservators should be experts in the history of the instrument and its material. Conservators should aim to restore the instrument to its original physical form or acoustic playability in the least destructive way possible using \\"non destructive analytical tools\\". Techniques such as spot treatments should be used to test the instruments reaction to particular conservation treatments in controlled areas, and technology such as CT scans and X-radiography should be used by conservators to analyze the internal mechanisms of musical instruments without invasive measures. Conservators of musical instruments can also borrow conservation science methods from other objects to which instruments are similar. Instruments often ‚Äúhave moving parts or they require physical interaction to fulfill the purpose for which they were made. They have this in common with many other objects including clocks, transport vehicles, arms and armor, hand tools, domestic utensils, scientific apparatus and industrial machinery‚Äù.Lamb, Andrew. (1995). \\"To Play or not to Play: the ethics of musical instruments conservation\\" Conservation Journalno 15. Retrieved from http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-15/to-play- or-not-to-play-the-ethics-of-musical-instrument-conservation String instruments, rely on the plucking of strings to create sound. Conservators should be versed in not only the construction of the instrument itself, but also the tension levels required to maintain the ideal acoustic sound of a particular instrument. Woodwind instruments are most often constructed of wood or metal but other materials such as plastic or brass may be used as well. Since air is blown into woodwind instruments to create sound, humidity can be trapped inside instruments. This is a particular concern for wooden woodwinds. Brass instruments are made exclusively of brass. Corrosion should be the highest concern for conservators working with brass instruments. Percussion instruments are particularly vulnerable as they are instruments designed to be struck or hit in order to create sound.  Ethics and Playability  Determining the playability of musical instruments can be difficult, especially in terms of the ethics of conservation-restoration. Ethical codes state that the aesthetic, historic and physical integrity of an object must to be respected. Often returning an instrument to playable condition requires modifications that cannot be readily undone, and removing unserviceable parts may also mean removing important historical evidence, such as original tool marks. Ethically, it is important to note that any techniques where the results cannot be undone should not be used in the conservation-restoration of instruments.Lamb, Andrew. (1995). \\"To Play or not to Play: the ethics of musical instruments conservation\\" Conservation Journalno 15. Retrieved from http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-15/to-play- or-not-to-play-the-ethics-of-musical-instrument-conservation Playability depends on the overall strength of the architecture of the instrument as well as the musician's interpretation or technique of a musical score. There are always two sides to every story: those for restoring musical instruments and those that are against. One of the arguments supporting the playing of instruments is that as a condition of their inclusion in public collections they are to be played. Other times, historical instruments are tied to educational institutions and certain period music cannot be fully appreciated without the use of historical instruments.Lamb, Andrew. (1995). \\"To Play or not to Play: the ethics of musical instruments conservation\\" Conservation Journalno 15. Retrieved from http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-15/to-play- or-not-to-play-the-ethics-of-musical-instrument-conservation On the other hand, while restoration work is done with the right intentions restoring an instrument to playable condition has proven to be detrimental to the long term preservation of instruments and is inconsistent with standards of practices for other classes of museum objects. ‚ÄúThe opponents of restoration argue that the truly authentic instrument is a reproduction of that relic, to the best of present knowledge and ability, in a state equivalent to what it was when new.‚Äô ‚ÄòA great deal of progress could result from making a distinction between ‚Äúsoundability‚Äù and playability, where the former can often be achieved without any prerequisite restoration.‚Äù Therefore, who in the cultural artifact conservation world draws the line between ‚Äúsoundability ‚Äù and playability? Musical instruments are designed to be played, they have moving parts that are intended to be used. The integrity of an instrument includes its sound, however, playing an instrument is inherently destructive and many times attempts to return instruments to playable condition mean modifying the original in ways that are not easily undone.Lamb, Andrew. (1995). \\"To Play or not to Play: the ethics of musical instruments conservation\\" Conservation Journalno 15. Retrieved from http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-15/to-play- or-not-to-play-the-ethics-of-musical-instrument-conservation/ The restoration of musical instruments is highly debated, this is due in part to the fact that notion of playability has not been defined enough. It is agreed upon that historic instruments are vital to understanding the history of music, but it is possible that reproductions may produce a more authentic sound, and a sound closer to that of the original instrument in its prime, than a restored original would sound. By playing reproductions it also eliminates the debate between ethics and playability, since the reproduction is not the original instrument. = Factors for Functional Restoration = According to Robert Barclay, the following are a list of the top five reasons for functional restoration. First, a restoration can be completed if ‚Äúthe instrument is mass- produced.‚Äù Second, if ‚Äúthe instrument has been previously restored and most ephemeral has been lost.‚Äù Third, with a little bit of work from a conservator, ‚Äúthe instrument can easily be put into working condition.‚Äù Fourth, ‚Äúthe original function can be reestablished.‚Äù Lastly, if ‚Äúthe instrument is in sturdy condition,‚Äù then it could be conserved. Its also vital to consider functional restoration if a reproduction instrument would not produce results equivalent to what a restored instrument would produce. This is very important to consider, especially if a historical instrument is tied to an educational institution. = Factors against Functional Restoration = Barclay also mentions some explanations for not functionally restoring musical instruments and the top five reasons are as follows. First a musical instrument should not be conserved if ‚Äúthe instrument is unique.‚Äù Second, work should not be completed if ‚Äúthe original ephemeral features will be lost or altered.‚Äù Third, the way the instrument could be played is unknown or ‚Äúthe function is obscure and unlikely to be determined as a result of restoration.‚Äù Fourth, ‚Äúthe condition of the instrument is such that an accurate achievement of its original quality of function is unlikely.‚Äù Lastly, if ‚Äúthe function is so well understood that no new information is likely to be gained.‚Äù It is also important to remember that functional restoration does not always align with the ethics and standards of practice of conservation-restoration. Functional restoration is generally more intrusive than basic conservation techniques, and will generally result in a greater loss of original components of the instrument.  Condition reporting before and after restoration with photographs & other documentation  Similarly to the document(s) that a museum registrar might use to catalog an artifact into a collection, it is important to keep the proper paperwork during the conservation process being done on a musical instrument. (If interested, there is also an example of a museum condition report right here from the Cleveland Museum of Contemporary Art. Additionally by taking before and after camera shots, it helps to document the steps taken by the conservator (or the rest of the conservation staff) while working on an instrument and the progress made during the duration of the project. A checklist could also help conservators stay focused on the task at hand trying to restore a particular musical instrument. But each plan is different for the conservation process depending on how severely wounded the instrument in question may be.

Early years Born on February 24, 1897 in Warsaw, which at that time belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland, Katelbach attended Gorski High School in Warsaw. In 1910, he joined secret Polish organization Association of Progressive Independent Youth (Zwiazek Mlodziezy Postepowo-Niepodleglosciowej), and in 1913, he entered the paramilitary Riflemen's Association. In August 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, Katelbach joined Polish Military Organisation. In November 1915, after German Army had captured Warsaw (see Great Retreat (Russian)), Katelbach began studying law at Warsaw University. While still a member of Polish Military Organisation, he also joined Association of the Polish Youth \\"Zet\\", and was one of leaders of a student strike in 1917. In late 1918 and early 1919, Katelbach fought in the Polish-Ukrainian War in Lw√≥w. In August 1919, together with other activists of Polish Military Organisation he organized the Sejny Uprising, aimed at local Lithuanian administration. During this rebellion, Katelbach became a close associate of Second Directorate of Polish General Staff (see History of Polish intelligence services), which was responsible for military intelligence and counterintelligence. As a member of Association of Kresy Guards, he came to Wilno after Zeligowski's Mutiny, and became editor in chief of the Gazeta Wilenska newspaper.  Second Polish Republic  In 1922, Katelbach was sent on a short mission to the Free City of Danzig, and in January 1923, shortly after his wedding with Zenaida n√©e Semplinska, he left for Berlin. Officially, Katelbach was a reporter of several Polish papers, but the real purpose of his mission was to provide a link between the government in Warsaw, and newly created Union of Poles in Germany. After a few months, Katelbach returned to Warsaw and work in a bank for over a year. In November 1925, he was sent to Geneva. Again, Katelbach was presented as a journalist, but in fact he was a resident spy. In May 1926, shortly before the May Coup (Poland), he was recalled to Poland, and joined pro-Sanacja organization Union for Improvement of the Republic. In January 1927, Katelbach was again sent to Berlin, tasked with centralization of Polish national organizations in Weimar Republic. He remained there until August 2, 1933, when he was sent to Kaunas, where Katelbach was regarded as unofficial Polish envoy to Lithuania. In 1937, after returning to Poland, he was awarded Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. In 1937 - 38, Katelbach together with his brother Stefan became actively involved in Polish filming industry. He managed film department at Polish Telegraphic Agency. In November 1938, after joining pro-government Camp of National Unity, he was elected to the Polish Senate from the District of Lublin.  World War Two  On September 12, 1939, Minister of Propaganda Micha≈Ç Gra≈ºy≈Ñski ordered Katelbach to form information and press office of his ministry at Budapest. Two days later, at a local office building in Zaleszczyki, Katelbach met with oppositional, anti-Sanacja politicians: Stanis≈Çaw Stro≈Ñski, Henryk Strasburger, Aleksander ≈Åado≈õ, August Zaleski and Tadeusz Tomaszewski. A few months later, all became involved in W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski's Government in Exile, located in France. Katelbach left Poland on September 14, and while in Romania, he immediately became involved in the activities of a political group associated with Ambassador Roger Raczy≈Ñski, Alfred Poninski and Polish military attache to Romania, Colonel Tadeusz Zakrzewski. It was partly due to their activities that members of legal Polish government, together with Prime Minister Felicjan S≈Çawoj Sk≈Çadkowski were interned by the Romanians in the town of Slanic. On September 21, Katelbach sent a letter to Skladkowski, urging him to resign from the post, and on the next day he left Romania, to reach Paris on October 6, 1939. Enjoying the support of Stanis≈Çaw Stro≈Ñski, who was deputy Prime Minister of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski's government-in-exile, Katelbach was offered a job at the Ministry of Information and Documentation. After the Fall of France, on June 23, 1940 he left for Portugal, via Spain, and joined the Committee of Aid for Polish Refugees in Lisbon. On July 14, 1940 he came to London, and was immediately named chairman of German Department at the Office of Documentation (part of Stanislaw Stronski Ministry of Information). Katelbach remained in this post since July 1941 until July 1945, when Great Britain ceased to recognize Polish government in Exile.  Postwar period and death  Grave of Tadeusz Katelbach in catacombs section of the PowƒÖzki Cemetery, Warsaw After the war, Katelbach decided to stay in London, where he lived until 1955, as an active member of Polish emigree circles. In June 1955 he left for Munich, where Jan Nowak-Jeziora≈Ñski offered him a job at Polish Section of Radio Free Europe. Recommended by Kazimierz Sosnkowski and Tadeusz Bielecki, Katelbach remained a full-time employee of the radio until his retirement in July 1965. In December 1965, together with wife, Katelbach left Munich and went to Seattle, where their daughter Nina Polan lived. In May 1966, they moved to New York City. Suffering from diabetes, Tadeusz Katelbach died from myocardial infarction on November 9, 1977 in New York City, while awaiting heart surgery. He was buried alongside his wife, Zenaida, and their daughter, in catacombs section of the PowƒÖzki Cemetery in Warsaw.  The Year of Bad Prophecies  Tadeusz Katelbach wrote several books, including his 1943 London diary \\"The Year of Bad Prophecies\\" (\\"Rok zlych wrozb\\"). In the book, he presents a vivid portrait of members of Polish Government in Exile, and criticizes Prime Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski for his decisions. Katelbach writes: \\"The year 1943 brought us bad events. Political leadership of the Polish Government in London was unable to cope with the difficult tasks. The westward march of the Soviet armies, flooding Polish lands, was a forecast of complete subjugation of Poland. The stance of Moscow leaves no illusions (...) After the disastrous Sikorski‚ÄìMayski agreement of 1941, Sikorski caused the dissolution of the National Council of Poland, so that there is no discussion of the agreement (...) The Allies are making it obvious that they are leaving us alone with Moscow. And Moscow has already decided the question of our Eastern borders. The realists know it, even though Stalin for propaganda reasons assures that Russia does not plan to seize non-Russian lands (...) The Soviets spend 200 000 pounds monthly for their propaganda, which is visible everywhere in England. At a movie theatre, during a Soviet film about Stalingrad, a Semitic-looking young man in front of me was hysterically clapping his hands upon seeing the Soviet dictator.\\"1943 r.

The story takes place in a future world consisting primarily of hazardous desert terrain where numerous biodomes of massive scale contain and protect the global populace. The album revolves around a character known as The Traveler; stranded in the desert and clinging to life, he embarks on a journey to return to the biodome from which he originates while recounting the events that led him to his fatal situation. The story serves as an allegory for one's own spiritual and subconscious evolution.

Writing and recording for New World occurred in the meantime with many of Kerzner's supporters preferring a double album over a single album. All of the compositions were written on either piano or guitar. Inspiration was taken from such bands as Genesis, Queen, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, ELO and The Beatles, as Kerzner's approach was to offer \\"one foot in nostalgia, one in the modern world\\" and to infuse recognizable classic rock and progressive rock influences with his own songwriting style.Dave Kerzner: New World review. Prog Magazine. Retrieved 2 March 2015. In order to find musicians who would assist him in recording the album, Kerzner contacted several individuals who had previously worked with him through his sound production company Sonic Reality or through other musical collaborations. Numerous musicians agreed to work on the album, including Nick D'Virgilio, Fernando Perdomo, Francis Dunnery, and Durga McBroom. D'Virgilio, a significant contributor to the album, was Kerzner's bandmate in Kevin Gilbert's band Thud. The tracks \\"Theta\\" and \\"My Old Friend\\" offer tribute to Gilbert, reuniting several of his old bandmates and acquaintances for its recording. During the recording process for most of the album's songs, Kerzner first developed mock-up tracks for the other musicians to use as a reference. These mock-up tracks consisted of him playing all of the instruments on his keyboard using Sonic Reality's music software products and sound library. Various types of drum mock-ups were created using samples from his Nick Mason drum library and other sample libraries. The tracks were then sent to his collaborators and guest musicians for them to use as a reference when they re- recorded live versions for the album. Each musician recorded their tracks at a remote location, some in their own studios. They were also permitted to provide their own interpretation of the mock-up tracks in order to offer their own signature to their respective contributions. Drummer Simon Phillips, for example, kept this interpretative leeway in mind while recording the drums for \\"Crossing of Fates\\" at Phantom Recordings in Los Angeles. These tracks were then sent back to Kerzner in Miami for mixing at South Beach Studios. A few songs such as \\"Under Control\\" and \\"Solitude\\" feature Kerzner playing all of the instruments including drums on the final recording. For these, he played all tracks on his keyboard using his sample library. \\"Crossing of Fates\\" was developed during a jam session with keyboardist Keith Emerson, a guest musician on the album;.Emerson guests on Kerzner album.

The film follows a young woman, named May Brandon, who dreams a medieval fantasy in which she is wooed, rescued and married by a loyal knight. When she awakes, she dismisses her fianc√© and tells him of her dream. He decides to become the knight of her dreams and dresses as one, but the experience is unpleasant and ruins her fantasy. There are no known staff or cast credits for the film, but a surviving film still shows three actors. The film was released on October 18, 1910 and was met with praise by The New York Dramatic Mirror. The film had a wide national release and was also shown in Canada, but is now presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from October 22, 1910. It states: \\"May Brandon is a young woman of the present day who finds that the course of true love can sometimes run too smooth. She is engaged to the man of her choice, but no one objects. In fact, there is not the slightest opposition to her marriage in any quarter. And, being a woman, she does not like it. Perhaps she would have been married in the orthodox way had it not been for a dream that she had. In her sleep she found herself a beautiful young woman, persecuted because she was loyal to the knight she had selected. Her father was obdurate, and finally practically made her a prisoner in his gloomy old castle. Her sweetheart called with a rope ladder. They escaped, and after a number of thrilling adventures were married, and presumably lived happy forever afterwards. When May awoke, she was more discontented than ever. She flouted her fianc√©, and returned his ring and swore she would never marry him. But finally she told him of her dream, and he won forgiveness by promising to run away with her like the knight of her dreams. Being a man of his word, he did. But the romance all faded out of it. The adventures they passed through were not to the woman's liking, and her experience convinced her that swashbuckling knights are as much out of date as are stagecoaches.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying three of the actors in the film.  Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on October 18, 1910. The film is known to have had a wide national release, with showing theaters in South Dakota, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Kansas, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Maryland, Nebraska, North Carolina, Montana, and Missouri. The film was also shown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada by the Province Theatre. The Moving Picture News and The Moving Picture World were both neutral in their review of the film, giving neither specific praise nor criticism of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror review was positive: \\"This idea has been used quite recently in an Independent film, but not nearly so effectively as in the hands of the capable Thanhouser players. They give the farcical events an air of reality that goes far to strengthen the comical results. ... She insists on her lover rigging himself up in knightly costume and carrying her off on a horse to be married. The absurdity of this business in modern times is not made as much of as might have been, but it brings plenty of laughter. The actress who played the part of the girl marred her work by turning too often to face the camera. She is very pretty and attractive but she should not permit it to appear that she is so well aware of her beauty.\\" Some advertisements by theaters heavily promoted the comedy aspect of the film with generic quips.

Flowing abreast the warm spring is another cold spring which meets the warm spring at a confluence, each maintaining its thermal properties. These attributes make the spring a tourist attraction in Nigeria. Research suggested that the warm spring has a temperature of about 70oC at the source and 37oC at the confluence. Background and history of the Ikogosi Warm Springs (1952-1977) In 1952, Southern Baptist missionary, Rev. John S. McGee, from his mission base in the nearby Ekiti town of Igede, went to the source of the hot and cold springs, about which he had heard from the Ikogosi people. Initially, he was discouraged from doing this, for reasons of the tradition he had heard from the local residents, which was that nobody should ever visit the source of these two streams, because of the idea that to do so would be to invite death from the supernatural forces that were responsible for this strange, and most unusual, feature of nature. In spite of these \\"warnings,\\" Rev. McGee made his way through the bush/forest, up the hill to the source of the two side-by-side springs. According to Rev. McGee's later brief, written account, \\"After seeing it, I felt that it could be used for a good purpose. I discussed the possible use of it with some of the Mission and (Nigerian Baptist) Convention friends. With the growing interest of Royal Ambassador work, and youth work, we felt that it could best be used by building a Youth Camp. I took it up with the Ekiti Association and we decided to build a camp for our R.A.s and G.A.s. The land was secured through the Convention.\\" The Reminiscence: Personal reflections and contributions by Rev. & Mrs. John S. McGee to the development of Baptist Mission Work in Western Nigeria (page 122); published by Sola Oresson & Associate; 10, Church Street, Pen Cinema; Agege, Lagos, Nigeria; authored by John David McGee, 2009 Having had the water from both springs tested to ensure its purity, Rev. McGee, with support from the Ekiti Baptist Association of churches and the Nigerian Baptist Convention who secured 28 acres of land which was the original camp, began planning for the building of the camp. The Baptist Mission architect, Rev. Wilfred Congdon (located at the Baptist Mission in Oshogbo) drew the design and plans for the original (16) buildings, which were built in this order: the swimming pool, fed by the warm springs (built in 1962); a combination dining hall, large kitchen and storage areas; eight (8) small cabins, each of which could house sixteen persons, with sleeping, bath and toilet facilities; a Baptist Mission residence, which was occupied by the McGees from the middle 1960s until October, 1973, when the McGees received word from Ibadan, that the Nigerian government was taking control of the camp; and finally, a chapel, was completed in the late 1960s. By 1972, all the buildings of the original Nigerian Baptist Convention camp had been completed, and the camp was being visited regularly by groups of Baptist youth and adults, along with missionaries and other visitors who came for vacation/\\"local leave.\\" According to a letter from Mrs. Doris McGee, \\"In 1968, we had 734 people stay at the camp either in the 12 camps or retreats, or on local leave or vacations. Already in the first four months of this year we have had 322 people in seven camps or retreats or for rest.\\" 1968 report from Doris McGee; The Reminiscence; pages 130-133. Waterpath of the Ikogosi Cold and Warm Spring In the late 1960s and early 1970s, following the Biafran Civil War, some public opposition to the Baptist Camp began to develop, particularly as the McGees resisted public/military use of the camp, as they gave firm priority to the religious events and groups for which it had been built. News from the Lagos area alleged that the facility being developed at the warm springs was the work of the (U.S.) Central Intelligence Agency, for political purposes. One newspaper, in particular, expressed the negative and critical views of one well-known writer, Dr. Tai Solarin, based on the misinformation that was being circulated. Finally, some prominent alumni (\\"old boys\\") of the Baptist College at Iwo (now Bowen University) brought Dr. Solarin to the Ikogosi camp to be introduced and to meet with Rev. McGee. My father told me that they were all together in my father's office at their house at the camp, when he went and got the \\"Prestigious Beaded Walking Stick,\\" which had been presented to him by the Ewi of Ado in 1961. He showed it to Dr. Solarin and told him, \\"Your people do not give this to someone who does not love them.\\" My father said that Dr. Solarin looked at it with amazement and asked, \\"Where did you get this?!\\" When my father told him, Dr. Solarin's attitude changed completely.The jReminiscence; page 57 Nonetheless, by early 1971, news of the Baptist Camp was becoming much more known by persons (outside of the Baptist Mission and Nigerian Convention) who saw possibilities for the development of a commercial, tourist resort. By December 22, 1973, the government had opened its guest house which was located by the warm springs swimming pool, and the following month, January 18, 1974, the McGees received word that the government was taking control of the swimming pool, the Baptist Camp's featured attraction. From that time forward, the activity at the camp significantly declined, with the McGees continuing to manage the facilities (other than the pool) from their Baptist Mission residence at Igede, until their retirement from Nigeria. When the McGees retired from Nigeria in July, 1977, Rev. McGee was installed as \\"Chief Akorewolu of Ikogosi,\\" by the Loja of Ikogosi Ekiti, in a ceremony that occurred on 1 July 1977. This followed Rev. McGee's having been installed as \\"Chief Gbaiyegun\\" by the Onigede, Chiefs and people of Igede on March 10, 1957. As mentioned above, in 1961, Rev. McGee was given the \\"Prestigious Beaded Walking Stick\\" by King Aladesanmi II of Ado-Ekiti, on behalf of the Ekiti Baptist Association.The Reminiscence; pages, 152-53; 48-50; 57-59. Unfortunately, for the future of the Baptist \\"Warm Springs\\" Camp at Ikogosi, when the McGees left, there was no Mission or Convention person available or willing to manage the camp, and in 1978, the entire property was sold to the Nigerian government by the Nigerian Baptist Convention, for the price of three-hundred thousand Naira. Within a matter of less than ten years, when the McGees very briefly visited Igede and Ikogosi (1985), the camp had been covered with bush. Rev. McGee, who walked to the camp on the road there he had built, told me that he did not bother to try to enter the camp grounds, and could barely see the buildings which were already being covered by bush.(Information source: I, John David McGee, am the older son of Rev. and Mrs. McGee; who grew up in Igede, and visited Ikogosi numerous times as a child; saw the camp area in 1960, before anything had been built; spent the summer at the camp there in 1964; and five weeks at the camp in 1972, after it had been completed.) As already described above, by the early-middle 1970s, the Nigerian government took control of the swimming pool, and had built some guest chalets adjacent to it, with a separate entrance road from that which the McGees had built to the camp entrance. From that time forward, there was always the hope/intention of developing that area for tourist purposes, but it was not until the past three or four years (2011-2014), that the Ekiti government under the leadership of its Governor, was able to enter into an agreement with resources which have been able to develop the facilities to their current high level. Just for the record, for those who may be interested, any of the current, renovated buildings which have a STONE portion of their exterior, are buildings which were preserved from the original Baptist camp.

The parish was originally founded in 1984, by clergy who had previously ministered in the Episcopal Church, as a parish under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston‚ÄìHouston. The parish operated in various locations before moving in 1992 to its current site, where the present church was completed in 2003. Upon the establishment of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter the church was transferred from the diocese to ‚Äì and became the principal parish of ‚Äì the Ordinariate; it now serves as the Ordinariate's Cathedral.

The Order of Mass is traditional and Anglican in character and content. History The Chancery (left) and Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham In 1980 Pope John Paul II established the Anglican Use of the Roman Catholic Church that allowed Anglicans to enter into communion with the Catholic Church, while retaining elements of their Anglican heritage. Jack D. Barker, \\"A History of the Pastoral Provision for Roman Catholics in the USA\\", chapter 1 of In 1982, Fr. James Moore and Fr. James Ramsey resigned their positions within the Episcopal Diocese of Texas to pursue a path into the Catholic Church. During this period, Fr. Moore and Fr. Ramsey held small weekly community meetings under the title of Our Lady of Walsingham. Bishop John Louis Morkovsky allowed the community, although not yet formally part of the Catholic Church, to worship at a local church where they met weekly for worship. On April 7, 1984, Fr. Moore and Fr. Ramsey were ordained as priests in the Roman Catholic Church and were appointed as co-pastors of Our Lady of Walsingham Catholic Church.Parish website. \\"History of the Parish\\". http://walsingham- church.org/history-of-the-parish-1 . Accessed 28 February 2015. The church moved several times during the following years until 1992 where it relocated to a small newly-constructed church at the current location. In 1999 a donation of $1m allowed the parish to begin planning building of a larger church. The new building was designed by Cram & Ferguson architects, and was consecrated in 2003, with the adjoining former church building becoming a church hall under the name St. Jude Hall. The church site was further expanded with offices, a classroom building and an outdoor shrine, which were all consecrated in May 2011. On January 1, 2012, with the establishment of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter, Our Lady of Walsingham became the principal church of the ordinariate. In 2014, a chancery was erected on the church's grounds to manage the operations of the ordinariate. On February 2, 2016, Steven J. Lopes was ordained as the first bishop of the ordinariate, succeeding Jeffrey N. Steenson as ordinary. With the ordination of Bishop Lopes, Our Lady of Walsingham was elevated to the status of a cathedral. In 2019 the Pope Benedict XVI House of Formation was erected for seminarians in formation for the priesthood in the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter, currently located across the street of the Chancery. Architecture One of the gargoyles on the church tower. The church features distinctive Anglican heritage designs with limestone covering the exterior, inspired by 14th century styles of the Walsingham area of Norfolk, England. The interior of the church is Neo-Gothic with stained glass window, and wooden furnishings carved in Colombia.

Clergy Before the implementation of Anglicanorum Coetibus in 2010, the parish was staffed chiefly by former Episcopalian clergy who were incardinated into the local Catholic diocese, one of whom was married but the rest were not. After 2010, a new parish rector (Fr Charles Hough IV) was appointed. Several associate priests assist him in his duties, and the current clergy of the cathedral are all married with children of their own.

Video games create new social and cultural worlds ‚Äì worlds that help people learn by integrating thinking, social interaction, and technology, all in service of doing things they care about.Shaffer, D., Squire, K., Halverson, R., & Gee, J. P. (2005) Computers and other technologies have already changed the way students learn. Integrating games into education has the potential to create new and more powerful ways to learn in schools, communities and workplaces. Games and learning researchers study how the social and collaborative aspects of video game play can create new kinds of learning communities. Researchers also study how the data generated by game play can be used to design the next generation of learning assessments. Research The games and learning research world studies how new digital media tools shift the topic of education research from recalling and repeating information to being able to find it, evaluate it and use it compellingly at the right time and in the right context. Games and learning research explores how games and game communities can lead to 21st-century educational skills such as higher order thinking, the ability to solve complex problems, think independently, collaborate, communicate and apply digital tools to effectively gather information. Research shows the educational and social benefits of digital games. Games do not need to be specifically geared towards education to be educational tools. Games can bring together ways of knowing, ways of doing, ways of being, and ways of caring. As John Dewey argued, schools are built on an obsession with facts. Students need to learn by doing, and with gaming, students can learn by doing something as a part of a larger community of people who share common goals and ways of achieving those common goals, making gaming a benefit for social reasons as well. Gaming has also changed the look of content-driven curriculum in schools. In content-driven media, people learn by being told and reflecting on what they are told. In gaming, game designers create digital environments and game levels that shape, facilitate and even teach problem solving.Gee, James Paul (2010) Games also teach students that failure is inevitable, but not irrevocable. In school, failure is a big deal. In games, players can just start over from the last save. A low cost failure ensures that players will take risks, explore and try new things. Much of the debate about digital games for education was based on whether or not games are good for education. But that question is overly simplistic. The National Research Council's report on laboratory activities and simulationsNational Research Council, 2005 makes clear that the design and not merely the medium of a physical or virtual learning activity determines its efficacy. Digital games are a medium with certain affordances and constraints, just as physical labs and virtual simulations are media with certain affordances and constraints. Simulations and digital games actually share many similarities in this regard. Although there are multiple definitions for games,Salen, K., & Zimmerman, E. 2004 the key characteristics differentiating games from simulations involve the explicit inclusion of (a) rules for engaging with the simulation, (b) goals for players to pursue, and (c) means for indicating players' progress toward those goals.Clark, Nelson, Sengupta, & D'Angelo, 2009Klopfer, Osterweil, & Salen, 2009Koster, 2004McGonigal, 2011 Properly designed, features of games can provide powerful affordances for motivation and learning. Individual studies have shown, for example, that well designed games can promote conceptual understanding and process skills,Annetta, Minogue, Holmes, & Cheng, 2009Clark et al., 2011Hickey, Ingram-Goble, & Jameson, 2009Ketelhut, Dede, Clarke, & Nelson, 2006Klopfer, Scheintaub, Huang, Wendal, & Roque, 2009Moreno & Mayer, 2000, 2004 can foster a deeper epistemological understanding of the nature and processes through which science knowledge is developedBarab et al., 2007Neulight, Kafai, Kao, Foley, & Galas, 2007 and can produce gains in players' willingness and ability to engage in scientific practices and discourse.Barab et al., 2009Galas, 2006McQuiggan, Rowe, & Lester, 2008Clark, D, Tanner-Smith, E., Killingsworth, S., & Bellamy, S. (2013) In his book What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, James Paul Gee talks about the application and principles of digital learning. Gee has focused on the learning principles in video games and how these learning principles can be applied to the K-12 classroom. Successful video games are good at challenging players. They motivate players to persevere and teach players how to play. Gee's video game learning theory includes his identification of thirty-six learning principles, including: 1) Active Control, 2) Design Principle, 3) Semiotic Principle, 4) Semiotic Domain, 5) Meta-level Thinking, 6) Psychosocial Moratorium Principle, 7) Committed Learning Principle 8) Identity Principle, 9) Self-knowledge Principle, 10) Amplification of Input Principle, 11) Achievement Principle, 12) Practice Principle, 13) Ongoing Learning Principle, and 14) Regime of Competence Principle and more.Gee, J. P. (2003). What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. Within these learning principles Gee shows the reader the various ways in which games and learning are linked and how each principle supports learning through gaming. One example would be Learning Principle 6: \\"Psychosocial Moratorium\\" Principle, where Gee explains that in games, learners can take risks in a space where real-world consequences are lowered. Another of Gee's principles, #8, that shows the importance of games and learning states that learning involves taking on and playing with identities in such a way that the learner has real choices (in developing the virtual identity) and ample opportunity to mediate on the relationship between new identities and old ones. There is tripartite play of identities as learners relate, and reflect on, their multiple real-world identities, a virtual identity, and a projective identity. Other research takes the position that these standards and testing methods are not conducive to teaching methods that incorporate video games. Games alone will not make schools more efficient, cannot replace teachers or serve as an educational resource that can reach an infinite number of students. The extent of the roles games will play in learning remains to be seen. More research in this area is needed to determine impact of games and learning. Peter Gray, who has conducted research on early childhood learning, states that gaming is purely a beneficial activity in young children. He states that children are able to choose how to most effectively use their time and that extensive use of a particular medium of learning shows they are taking something valuable from it. He goes on to state the significance of the computer in the modern age and that not utilizing it as a learning tool is simply foolish. Video gaming has shown positive levels of improvement in areas of cognitive function. In their study \\"Improving Multi-Tasking Ability through Action Videogames\\". Chiappe and colleagues determined that 50 hours of gaming significantly improved results on a performance test modeled after skills used when piloting an aircraft.Chiappe, Dan, Mark Conger, Janet Liao, J. Lynn Caldwell, and Kim- Phoung L. Vu Aside from this, areas of attention and vigilance, as well as basic visual processes have shown to improve with allotted video game time. Application Digital learning tools have the potential of being customized to fit the abilities of individual students and can engage them with interactive tasks and simulate real-life situations. Games can create new social and cultural worlds that may not have been available to everyone in the past. These worlds can help people learn by integrating thinking, social interaction, and technology, all in service of doing things they care about. Video games are important because they let people participate in and experience new worlds. They let players think, talk, and act in new ways. Indeed, players inhabit roles that are otherwise inaccessible to them. One example of a game where players are learning while playing would be The Sims, a real-time strategy game where players need to make decisions that alter their character's life. They can manipulate the scenario to create digital lives where they can experience the struggles of single parenthood or poverty. Players in this game are not allowed to modify a previous decision to alter the outcome, even if the outcome is unpleasant. The goal is to survive to the best of their abilities. The game is complicated and difficult, just as it would be to live a real life. Regarding a more traditional approach to education, The Sims has been used as a platform for students to learn a language and explore world history while developing skills such as reading, math, logic and collaboration. While not all researchers agree, some recent studies have shown the positive effects of using games for learning. A study carried out by professor Traci Sitzmann at the University Oregon among 6,476 students states that \\"trainees in the game group had 11 percent higher factual knowledge levels, 14 percent higher skill-based knowledge levels, and 9 percent higher retention levels than trainees in the comparison group\\". Some other aggregated studies also show an increase in learning performance thanks to the use of videogames. Controversy Critics suggest that lessons people learn from playing video games are not always desirable. Douglas Gentile, an associate professor of psychology at Iowa State University found that children who repeatedly play violent video games are learning thought patterns that will stick with them and influence behaviors as they grow older. Researchers from this study found that over time children started to think more aggressively, and when provoked at home, school or in other situations, children reacted much like they did when playing a violent video game.Iowa State University Study, 2014 But even the harshest critics agree that people can learn something from playing video games. While research on the behavioral and cognitive impacts of video games with violence have shown mixed outcomes, games with little or no violence have shown promising results. Elizabeth Zelinski, a professor of gerontology and psychology at the University of Southern California states that some digital games have been shown to improve the function of the brain, while others have the potential to reverse cognitive loss associated with aging.Bergland, C. 2013 Some games require players to make decisions ranging from simple to quite complex to drive its progress. Some researchers question whether a greater reliance on video games is in students' best interests, indicating there is little proof that skillful game play translates into better test scores or broader cognitive development. Emma Blakey notes very few studies have examined whether video games improve classroom performance and academic achievement. Others, like Emma Blakey, a PhD researcher in developmental psychology at the University of Sheffield in England, question whether a greater reliance on video games is in students' best interests, indicating there is little proof that skillful game play translates into better test scores or broader cognitive development.

The case also included various obiter comments about the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Parties The named claimant, Royal Westminster Investments S.A., was a special purpose company incorporated in Panama, and was alleged to be a nominee of and under the control of the other claimants, who were all members of the same family. Accordingly, in the judgment of the Privy Council all of the respondents are collectively referred to as the \\"Mahtani parties\\". The respondent, Nilon Limited, was a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands against whom rectification of the share register was sought. Nilon was incorporated on 7 November 2002 by the second defendant, Mr Manmohan Varma. Mr Varma was registered as the sole registered shareholder of all of the issued shares in Nilon. Facts The Mahtani parties claimed that there was an oral contract between Mr Varma and themselves which was made in October 2002 in England. The essence of that agreement was that: # A new offshore company would be incorporated in the British Virgin Islands to be called Nilon, and it would be operated from Jersey as the holding company of certain Nigerian operating companies, involved in the importation and sale of rice to Nigeria. # The executive decision making powers of Nilon would be in the hands of Mr Varma or companies associated with him, and they would be paid a management fee. # The Mahtani parties and Mr Varma as joint venture partners would remit an initial payment to a bank account to be opened in the Channel Islands in the name of Nilon as the initial capital. # Each side would be entitled to an equal profit share from the businesses run by Nilon. # Mr Varma would procure the issue of voting shares in Nilon in such that (i) Mr Varma would own 37.5% of the issued shares in Nilon; (ii) 5% would be allotted to a local Nigerian investor to be agreed between the joint venture partners; and (iii) the remaining 57.5% would be allotted to the Mahtani parties. # The Mahtani parties alleged that they contributed funds to Nilon pursuant to this oral agreement, and received dividend payments from Nilon pursuant to it. They claimed to be legal and/or beneficial owners of shares in Nilon, but that Mr Varma failed to procure the allotment of shares in Nilon to them as agreed, or the entry of their names in its share register. Consequently, they claimed declarations that they are owners of the agreed proportions of the issued shares in Nilon, and sought orders that the share register be rectified under section 43(1)(a) of the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 to reflect the issuance of those shares. Mr Varma accepted that there was an agreement reached on the relevant date concerning the terms of a joint venture between him and the Mahtani parties. Those agreed terms included (1) the incorporation of Nilon in the British Virgin Islands; (2) the opening of a joint venture bank account in Jersey into which each joint venture partner would make an initial capital contribution by way of loan; (3) profit sharing arrangements; (4) that all control and decision making powers would vest in him or his group of companies, who would receive a management fee. He accepted that money had been remitted by the Mahtani parties, but claimed that these were loans and were not remitted as the subscription price for shares in Nilon, and that the sums paid by Nilon to the Mahtani parties were not dividends. Preliminary issues The Mahtani parties applied to the Commercial Court in the British Virgin Islands for permission to serve Mr Varma out of the jurisdiction. Bannister J initially refused permission to serve out of the jurisdiction because there was no real issue to be tried between the Mahtani parties on their rectification claim, since the Mahtani parties were not shareholders in Nilon and there was no allegation that Nilon itself had ever agreed to allot any shares to them. He further struck out the claim against Nilon for largely the same reasons. The Mahtani parties appealed against both points. The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court Court of Appeal allowed the appeals by the Mahtani parties and decided that there was an arguable claim against Nilon, and that was a claim to which Mr Varma was a necessary and proper party. The principal point of law in both instances, whether there is a sustainable claim for rectification of Nilon's share register, was the same in both appeals. Decision The only judgment was given by Lord Collins. After drawing attention to minor differences between the procedural rules between the Civil Procedure Rules in England and the British Virgin Islands (which he held were not material for the purposes of the appeal), Lord Collins referred to his own leading judgment setting out the applicable principles in relation to service out in AK Investment CJSC v Kyrgyz Mobil Tel Ltd [2011] UKPC 7, [2012] 1 WLR 1804, at para 71. He summarised those principles as follows:At paragraph 13. Accordingly, held Lord Collins, the critical issue in the appeal was whether there is a real issue to be tried between the Mahtani parties and Nilon (over whom the British Virgin Islands courts have jurisdiction as of right as a company incorporated in that jurisdiction) such that the Nilon might properly operate as an \\"anchor defendant\\" in relation to the claims against Mr Varma. In relation to this point the judge at first instance and the Court of Appeal had disagreed, and their disagreement largely centered upon the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Re Hoicrest [2000] 1 WLR 414. In that case the Court of Appeal had held that a person who had no right to claim legal title to certain shares (only an equitable interest in the shares) was held to be entitled to maintain a claim for rectification of the share register. In a nutshell, Bannister J as the judge at first instance felt this decision was wrong and declined to follow it; the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal thought it was correct and reversed him, following the English precedent. =Re Hoicrest Ltd= After careful analysis of the law in this area, and noting the fact that (i) Re Hoicrest Ltd was the only decision in English legal history to take this approach - every other decision had taken the opposite approach, and (ii) Re Hoicrest Ltd was only in relation to determination of costs in a case management hearing, Lord Collins held that \\"Re Hoicrest Ltd was wrongly decided and should not have been followed by the Court of Appeal in this case.\\"At paragraph 32. Accordingly, he allowed the appeal and set aside the permission to serve Mr Varma out of the jurisdiction, and struck out the claim against Nilon. =Forum non conveniens= Although this analysis was sufficient to dispose of the appeal, Lord Collins added some additional obiter dictum comments in relation to the doctrine of forum non conveniens. The Court of Appeal had held that \\"the BVI was clearly the appropriate forum for trial as a preliminary issue of the questions arising between the members and alleged members of Nilon.\\"At paragraph 56. Lord Collins indicated his disagreement with that statement. In this case the principal question was whether there had been a breach of an oral agreement made between Mr Varma and the Mahtani parties. Nilon was an ancillary part to that agreement, and indeed, did not even exist at the time that agreement was entered into. The agreement was entered into in England, and a majority of the relevant parties were resident in England. Accordingly, if viewed properly as a breach of contract claim - rather than a claim for rectification of a share register - then the most appropriate forum for the trial of these actions was in England.At paragraph 66. Because of Lord Collins' status as general editor of Dicey Morris & Collins on the Conflict of Law those obiter comments are likely to attract great weight. Comment Commentators have indicated that \\"[t]he case has important implications for the shareholders of the 700,000+ BVI holding companies who could not have expected to face claims in the BVI Court about ownership of shares of the company, where the underlying facts have nothing to do with the BVI\\", and that the case \\"clarif[ies] the power of the courts to rectify the share register of a BVI company under section 43(1)(a) of the BVI Business Companies Act 2004.\\" See also * United States v.

(Woody) Watson (b. 06 Aug 1947) My Genealogy Home Watson is known to friends and colleagues as \\"Woody.\\" \\"Conversations With James (Woody) Watson Anthropology News 2 February 2007  McDonald's in Hong Kong  One of James L. Watson's articles talks about how the cultural change happening in Hong Kong is a result of globalization. It is apparent that the Hong Kong natives became accustomed to American fast food values, drifting away from their local culture. The author also demonstrates how McDonald's encourages cultural integration. James L. Watson's article on \\"McDonald's in Hong Kong\\" explains the penetration process in Hong Kong. Many believed that it would be a difficult task for McDonald's to access Hong Kong's food market. The younger generations have become accustomed to many influences outside the borders of their locality. Without compromising Hong Kong‚Äôs own national identity and cultural products, McDonald‚Äôs has successfully integrated American fast food chains into their everyday lives. Before 1975, hamburgers, fries and sandwiches were presumed as snacks. McDonald‚Äôs saw it as their duty to construct a franchise and positively enforce the notion that their food could be considered a full meal. Western values of fast food were not a significant cultural phenomenon in Hong Kong until the early 1980s, when young consumers slowly changed the eating habits of their elders from consuming traditional Chinese food to eating fast food. Integrating the invention of cleanliness, which traditional restaurants did not prioritize, the McDonald's brand exceeded customers‚Äô expectation in the 1980s. This suggests the idea that the restaurant was a catalyst to a new cleaning standard. With this new standard of cleanliness, \\"McDonald‚Äôs‚Ä¶[was] more than just a restaurant, it‚Ä¶[was] an oasis, a familiar rest station, in what is perceived to be an inhospitable urban environment\\".Watson, James L. \\"McDonald's in Hong Kong.\\" The Globalization Reader. Ed. Frank J. Lechner and John Boli. 4th ed. Malden, MA: Blackwell, 212. Print. Overall, the company emphasized its priorities on the importance of clean facilities as one of their main qualities. Customer characteristics are different in all societies; their demeanour, their manners, the way they present themselves and so on. In a place such as America, politeness and good manners are considered a norm, but in Hong Kong‚Äôs society, friendliness, excess of congeniality, attentiveness is frowned upon and deemed suspicious, and thus it was harder to implement service with a smile in this given environment. During the training process, employees were taught how to treat customers with manners, transferring the notion of American \\"friendliness\\" over to Hong Kong citizens, as opposed to the dominant qualities for customer service that entailed directness, proficiency and composure. Western values of consumer discipline gradually implemented into Hong Kong's society. Consumers have accepted key elements of the American fast food formula, but with localized adaptations. The establishment of an American-inspired model of customers queuing was introduced. Queue monitors were sanctioned in order to encourage the formation of orderly lines at McDonald's, which later became an in-restaurant norm by the 1980s. Children as consumers have been noted to alter the equity of domestic power in Hong Kong homes. Through advertisements, in between their favourite television shows, children have acquired a vast array of knowledge about popular culture and popular fast food conventions. McDonald's began hosting children birthday parties, which promoted people of Hong Kong to celebrate not only their lunar birthdate, but also their Western calendrical birthdates as well. The author concludes that \\"younger people‚Ä¶are avid consumers of transnational culture in all of its most obvious manifestations: music, fashion, television, and cuisine\\". From the author's view, globalization has driven cultural integration all over the world.

It has also been published in English as The Fire Within. It tells the story of a 30-year-old man who after military service, followed by a few years of cosmopolitan, decadent life, has become burned out, addicted to heroin and tired of living. The author's source of inspiration for the main character was the surrealist poet Jacques Rigaut (1898‚Äì1929). The novel has been the basis for two feature films, Louis Malle's The Fire Within from 1963 and Joachim Trier's Oslo, August 31st from 2011. Plot Alain Leroy is 30 years old. He served in World War I and has led a cosmopolitan, decadent life for a few years, before being admitted to a mental institution for depression, fatigue and heroin addiction. He is unable to adapt to the regulated life of the institution, but the doctor does not think his stay needs to be extended. Alain visits several old friends in Paris. He is presented with several opportunities to return to a regular life, but is unable to find any satisfying human connection, and other people have a hard time sympathising with his situation. Alain returns to his room at the hospital where he commits suicide. Publication The book was published by √©ditions Gallimard in 1931. It was published in English in 1965, translated by Richard Howard under the title The Fire Within. A translation by Martin Robinson was published in 1966 as Will O' the Wisp. In 2012 the novel was published in Gallimard's Biblioth√®que de la Pl√©iade series, as part of the volume Romans, r√©cits, nouvelles. Reception Anna Balakian of The Saturday Review wrote in 1965 that \\"Drieu manages an unsentimentalized objectivity in picturing the futile machinations of Alain's wasted mind[.]\\" Balakian continued: \\"Alain's nocturnal meanderings through the great, unresponsive city are illumined here and there by some erotic encounters. Thus the book is primarily a mood piece in which night prevails; as such it will be understood by the dispirited of any age and by those who watch with anguish the likes of Alain seeking the tunnel of narcotic release from which there is no exit. Although vaguely drawn, Alain is less dated as a type than many a humanistic figure projected by better known writers of the 1930s.\\" Kirkus Reviews described the novel as \\"piquant, perverse, and rather sterile\\", and wrote: \\"La Rochelle handles this with a certain boutique decadence and a tired resignation (the novel is subtitled 'autobiographical') which is true to the experience ... but perhaps self- defeating to the book.\\" Adaptations The book was adapted for film by Louis Malle as The Fire Within, starring Maurice Ronet and released in 1963. It was also the basis for the 2011 Norwegian film Oslo, August 31st, directed by Joachim Trier.

Protagonists ; / : :The last surviving Sanjiyan Unkara who was discovered by Yakumo's father in Tibet. Yuzo Takada sometimes calls her the three-eyed elf girl from China, but she wears traditional Tibetan clothes. As is typical with members of her race, she developed a split personality as she grew older to cope with the problems of an exceptionally long life. However, Pai is the only Sanjiyan ever shown that has true multiple personality disorder. Her first personality, called Pai in the series, has the appearance of a normal human and is that of a cheerful and naive girl. The second personality, that of Parvati IV, usually arises when Pai is defenseless, endangered, or emotionally overcome. :The presence of the Sanjiyan in Pai is distinguishable because the normally invisible third eye in her forehead opens when Parvati awakens. Most characters refer to her as Sanjiyan when she's in that state. Sanjiyan is more rigid and stoic than Pai and is able to use powerful magic, unlike her first personality. However, using those powers is draining to the Sanjiyan and requires them to rest, leaving them exposed to danger. Her split personality is a possible reference to the Hindu goddess Parvati, who had many identities, each with their own personalities. Volume 32 introduces a clone of hers, named Kali. In Hindu mythology, Kali was an immensely powerful and bloodthirsty battle goddess and one of Parvati's many identities. :Pai can absorb a human soul to do her bidding, transforming the person affected into a nearly invulnerable servant. She has other mystical powers usually manifested along with the appearance of her third eye, and used by her Parvati identity. Older Sanjiyans often become evil, decadent and uncaring; younger ones tend to have split personalities. Three-hundred-year-old Pai is an example of a younger Sanjiyan: her Pai personality is somewhat flaky, caring, and cheerful, while her Parvati personality is more arrogant and ruthless. The two personae are aware of one another and sometimes talk between themselves. :Believing herself to be the last of her kind, Pai seeks to become human through the use of the Ningen no Z≈ç, the Statue of Humanity, which reputably has the power to turn a Sanjiyan into a mortal, by transferring the powers of two of the race into a third member. The Ningen, incidentally, is how the other members of her kind reputedly became human and thus died out. Pai has been shown to have feelings for Yakumo. ; : :The primary male protagonist, he became Pai's Wu and companion when a rampaging Takuhi, Pai's demon friend, fatally wounded him. Before he could die, Pai merged his soul with her own, transforming him into a Wu, which in turn made him immortal as long as Pai lives. He can feel pain but he won't die. He will regenerate from any wound, no matter how severe. :His father, Professor Fujii, was an archaeology professor and would-be monster hunter, who visited Tibet to research the legends of the immortal Sanjiyans. There he met Pai, a relatively youthful member of that mythical race, and he made a promise to help her become human. However, he fell ill while trying to depart the Chinese province of Yunnan and died shortly after completing a letter to his son, asking him to take over helping Pai with her quest. Yakumo tries to keep that promise. Yakumo has been shown to have feelings for Pai. ; :Parvati's pet bird that's responsible for the events that led Yakumo into becoming Parvati's undead Wu. He's killed by one of Kaiyanwang's followers while they're trying to find Steve Long and Mei Ling Ling. ;Jake McDonald : :A treasure hunter looking for the secret of immortality that Sanjiyans keep. ; :A merchant who offers magic. He's a human of Pakistani descent and uses magic to defend himself against demons. He first appears in volume 7 of the manga to settle a debt with Yakumo Fujii. Ends up romantically involved with Y≈çko Ayanok≈çji. ; / :The snake demon that was sealed within Parvati's body from volumes 3-5; she returns in volume 12 with a new body and identity. She's a water-based demon with the power to manipulate water at will, with deadly results. Ends up in love with Haan Hazrat. Supporting ; :The chief editor and founder of Yougekisha. He's turned into stone after getting a little too close to the demon world, but is revived later. His main interest is to study the Sanjiyan Unkara so that he can write a great article for his magazine. ; : :Yougekisha's editor in Chen Aguri's absence. At first, she's reluctant to believe in the occult, but traveling with Yakumo and Pai has led her to change her attitude. She's since become extremely interested in the subject‚Äîif only to make money off of publishing material for the magazine. ; : :The sister of Steve Long, she meets Pai and Yakumo when looking to save her brother from kidnappers. She's an excellent martial artist. Was to be a sacrifice in episode 3. ; : :A Taoist and a regular human, he's quite skilled at using paper charms, and can sense demonic energy. Antagonists ; / Shiva :The strongest Sanjiyan. His ambitions drove him to wage war against the rest of the Sanjiyan Unkara, which ultimately led them to their fate. He was sealed away by Parvati IV after a bloody struggle. While the names Shiva and Kaiyanwan are normally used essentially interchangeably, more correctly, they represent two aspects of the same individual. The Shiva personality sacrificed itself to prevent Kaiyanwang from killing Parvati centuries prior to the main story. ; : :The Wu of Kaiyanwang. He assumed command of Kaiyanwang's demons after his master was sealed away by Parvati. He's spent the last 300 years searching for ways to revive Kaiyanwang from his sealed prison. Before becoming a Wu, Benares was a powerful dragon monster who consumed various holy demons. This allowed him to absorb enough intelligence to eventually transform himself into the humanoid being we see today. Even before the Wu transformation, he was tremendously powerful, with the added power he became virtually unstoppable. Benares is a highly powerful figure within the demon world physically, magically, and politically, and strikes fear into even the bravest of souls. ; : :A servant of Benares that commands a sizable range of demons including Hong-nyang, to whom he refers as Ran Pao Pao. He knows how to fight using magic talismans enchanted with celestial calligraphy, demonstrating explosive attacks and imprisoning spells. Ch≈çkai is also a skilled martial artist, despite his chunky size, and possesses two forms. The first is a normal Chinese human with a whisker-like moustache, donning a heavy trench coat with a fedora hat and round dark spectacles. His other form is a larger, muscular demon (though he still keeps his glasses and whiskers) with long teeth who can devour others by opening his body exposing the tentacles and negative space within. Because he has knowledge on using magic circles, Benares charges Ch≈çkai with finding and destroying keys and entrances (named Konron) into the world that the Sanjiyan inhabited, the seichi (literally translates to \\"holy land\\"). In the anime, Choukai has a disturbing chuckle. ; : :A demon enforcer under Ch≈çkai's command. Normally appears as an tall muscular and pale skinned woman with flared red hair, long teeth, and completely red eyes. She can also grow an extra limb from underneath each of her arms and can deceptively change form into a small child that resembles a super deformed version of her normal form. After Ch≈çkai's death Ran Pao Pao becomes one of Pai's servants.

He was one of the youths who forced Sukarno and Hatta to declare independence immediately after the surrender of the Japanese. He was the first Indonesian Minister of Youth and Sport (although in his era the office was called Minister of State of Youth Affairs). He was a member of the Indonesian Communist Party. Sometime after the coup d'√©tat attempt, he was arrested and went missing. Biography =Early life= Wikana was born on 16 October 1914 in Sumedang. He was the fourteenth child of sixteen. His father was Raden Haji Soelaiman, immigrant from Demak, and his mother was Nonoh. Wikana was son of menak family in Sumedang. His brother was Winanta, an exile to Digul, according to Soemarsono, one of youth leaders generation '45. According to Ben Anderson, Wikana attended to Dutch-speaking Europeesch Lagere School (ELS) and continued his study to Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (MULO). After graduating from MULO, Wikana became contributor in Bandung weekly Fikiran Rakjat according to an article of Merdeka dated 15 May 1947. According to Trikoyo Ramidjo, Wikana was a member of the Communist Party of Indonesia since the 1930s. Wikana also was a member of the Bandung branch of Partai Indonesia (Partindo). In 1935, Wikana went to Surabaya to lead Masjarakat Baroe weekly. In 1938 he went to Jakarta leading Kebangoenan daily. In the same year, he was elected Penulis Umum II of Gerakan Rakyat Indonesia (Gerindo; Indonesian People Movement) and chairman of its youth section, Barisan Pemuda Gerindo (Gerindo Youth Wing). In October 1938, Wikana, Amir Sjarifuddin, Asmara Hadi, dan A.M. Sipahutar became the editorial boards of political monthly magazine Toedjoean Rakjat. According to Harry A. Poeze, in the first volume of Tan Malaka, Gerakan Kiri, dan Revolusi Indonesia, Wikana contributed to Menara Merah (Red Tower), Moscow-influenced newspaper. Wikana was responsible for the paper circulation in West Java. In June 1940, he together with Adam Malik and Amir Sjarifuddin was suspected by colonial government after a copy of Menara Merah discovered. According to Ben Anderson, along with Adam Malik and Pandu Kartawiguna, he was charged with distributing the newspaper and arrested. After the Dutch colonial government surrendered to Japanese imperial army, Wikana was released from Cilacap prison. Around September or October 1944, Wikana offered Sjahrir to be a lecturer at the Asrama Indonesia Merdeka, a school for Indonesian young men above high school but for non-high school graduates from high school. The school was supported and supervised by Japanese, Yoshizumi Tomegoro and Nishijima Shigetada and opened in December 1944 in Jakarta. Beside Wikana and Sjahrir, the teachers were Sukarno, Hatta, Subardjo, Iwa Kusumantri, Soediro and Sjahrir. =Proclamation of independence= On 14 August 1945, some young men held a meeting in the Bacteriological Laboratory in Pegangsaan after the news of Japanese army surrendering spread. The result was Wikana with some other young men being sent to convince Sukarno to proclaim independence. They left the lab and were on their way to Kaigun office, then they met Achmad Soebardjo, Iwa Kusumantri, Buntaran, and Samsi. After some talks, the young men proceeded to Pegangsaan Timur 56, placed where Sukarno lived. After they debated Sukarno, Wikana said to Sukarno, \\"If Bung Karno will not declare this proclamation, tomorrow there will be murder and bloodshed.\\" Sukarno answered, \\"Here is my throat! Drag me into a corner, finish me off tonight! Don't wait till tomorrow.\\" According to Sukarno in his autobiography Bung Karno Penyambung Lidah Rakyat, he refused Wikana because he felt that they were not ready if they had to fight against the Japanese army physically. However, according to Poeze, Sukarno refused because there would be a PPKI meeting in Jakarta and Sukarno didn't want to leave the meeting. The debate heated after Mohammad Hatta joined, invited by Soebardjo. Hatta said that the surrender news was not official yet. He didn't want the declaration to lead to chaos. Wikana then said that the young men had enough power to fight back Japanese physically. Hatta answered if the young men wanted to declare independence immediately they should declare that themselves. Wikana replied that he and young men did not want to be responsible for any consequences if the declaration were not made immediately. One day after the proclamation, Wikana, Chairul Saleh, and Sukarni attended a meeting held by PPKI. On 27 August 1945, Wikana was elected a member of the Indonesian National Party (PNI). Wikana was a member of Angkatan Pemuda Indonesia (API; Indonesian Young Generation), later becoming the chairman. He together with Soemarsono went to Yogyakarta to attend the First Youth Congress on 10 November 1945. The result was seven of twenty nine organizations merging into one, Pemuda Sosialis Indonesia (Pesindo; Socialist Youth of Indonesia). On 11 November, Wikana elected vice chairman of the organization. Wikana was the State Minister of Youth Affairs during two cabinets led by Sjahrir cabinet and two cabinets led by Amir Sjarifuddin cabinet. One week before the first appointment, though, on behalf of the Persatuan Perjuangan, Wikana stated that he didn't want to be in the cabinet. Under Amir Sjarifuddin, Wikana served from July 1947 to January 1948. He lived in Yogyakarta as the minister because during the struggle of the independence Indonesia's capital moved to the city. In early 1948, Hatta replaced Amir Sjarifuddin as prime minister. Wikana was appointed by Hatta as Military Governor of Surakarta. After the 1948 Madiun rebellion, Hatta replaced Wikana with Colonel Gatot Subroto. On 1 September 1948, Wikana began to serve as the secretary of the youth section of the politbureau. After the Pesindo conference on 4‚Äì12 November 1950, he was no longer elected as the executive member. Later, on 29 December, he resigned from a study group run by the Murba Party. Wikana was remained a member of the Central Committee of the PKI until 7 January 1951 when the new leaders of the party were announced. In 1953, he was appointed a member of the Constitutional Assembly (Konstituante). In the 1955 Indonesian Constituent Assembly election 1955 general election, Wikana and Alimin represented the PKI for Constituent Assembly. Later, in December 1956, Wikana was appointed as secretary of the party fraction in the assembly. After the sixth congress of the party in September 1959, Wikana was reelected as full member of central committee. In 1963 he was a member of DPA. In 1965, he was invited by Chairul Saleh to be a member of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS). However he had no power in party nor government. =After PKI movement and arrest= Sometime before 1965 coup attempt, Wikana and other PKI delegates went to Beijing, China, to celebrate the national day of China. After the news of the coup attempt spread, Wikana ordered other delegates to stay in Beijing. However, he returned to Indonesia. Wikana arrived in Jakarta on 10 October 1965. According to Chairul Saleh in AM Hanafi Menggugat, when Wikana arrived at Kemayoran Airpoty, he was immediately arrested by the military. According to Wikana's third child, he was detained in Kramat. After being questioned for two nights, Wikana was released. On 9 June 1966, Wikana he was arrested by around ten unidentified armed men in his house. After the event, he went missing. Legacy Wikana's works are about movements and communism. He wrote Organisatie, Pengoempoelan Boeah Pena (Oesaha Penerbitan Tengara, 1947), Dokumentasi Pemuda Sekitar Proklamasi Indonesia Merdeka (co- write with DN Aidit and Legiono, published by Badan Penerangan Pusat SBPI, 1948), and Satu Dua Pandangan Marxisme (Revolusioner, 194x).

He was a World War I veteran, fighting as an ANZAC in Gallipoli, the Somme, Pozi√®res, Passchendaele and Amiens. He rose rapidly through the ranks, becoming a Major at the age of 21. He was mentioned in dispatches three times. He was awarded a DSO on 14 December 1916 by King George V. After the war, he started a farm at Brookfield near Brisbane. He was chairman of the board of the Committee of Direction of Fruit Marketing in Queensland for 30 years. In 1964 Savage presided over the establishment of the Golden Circle cannery. In 1969 he was awarded an MBE, for his services to the fruit and vegetable industry of Queensland. Early life Percival Savage was born in Ipswich, Queensland, Australia on 22 October 1894. He was the son of Richard Savage, a blacksmith, and Mary-Ann Savage (n√©e McDowell). Savage attended Ipswich Boys Grammar School. He initially worked for the Queensland Railway as a coach builder. War years Within a month of war being declared he enlisted in the 3rd Field Company Engineers. On 22 September 1914, he boarded the HMAT \\"Geelong\\" in Melbourne for Egypt. He was nineteen years ten months. =Gallipoli and Egypt= On 11 December 1914 the 3rd Field Company arrived at Mena training camp close to the pyramids. After almost four months at Camp Mena the Company sailed from Alexandria to Mudros Bay on the Greek island of Lemnos. This was the staging post for Gallipoli, 100 km to the north-east. Here they constructed sledges for conveying materials ashore. They took on board casks of water, timber, shovels and barbed wire. Their ship arrived off Anzac Cove before dawn on 25 April 1915, and the company landed early that morning.Postcard from ANZAC Cove, Gallipoli, 1915, sent by Major Percival Savage Company diaries show the Engineers (also called sappers) digging firing line and communication trenches, sniping posts, machine gun pits and a well. They created barbed wire barriers, prepared maps of the Turkish trenches and made hand grenades. Where trenches would be overlooked by the Turkish forces, tunnels were constructed. Savage progressed rapidly through the ranks. He was promoted to Lieutenant in February 1915, and Captain at ANZAC Cove five months later on 26 July 1915. From September 1915 on, he wrote the Company's official diary. On 11 November 1915, shortly after Savage's 21st birthday, the 3rd Field Company Engineers withdrew from Gallipoli back to Egypt. On 19 March 1916, while stationed in Serapeum, Egypt, they were inspected by the Prince of Wales. =France and the Western Front= On 26 March 1916, he embarked on the HMT Maryland for Marseilles, France, along with 35 other troops and 74 horses. While stationed at Sailly There are several places in France called Sailly. However, as he fought at Pozi√®res two months later, it seems likely that he was stationed in one or other of the neighbouring communes Sailly-Laurette and Sailly-le-Sec, which are about southwest of Pozi√®res. in France, he was commissioned to the rank of Major on 12 May 1916, at the age of 21, the youngest Major in the AIF. In late July 1916, he fought at the Battle of Pozi√®res (part of the Battle of the Somme), for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (19 August 1916). He was chosen (together with Colonel J.A. \\"Reg\\" Robinson) to represent the first AIF at an award ceremony in Buckingham Palace. He received the DSO from George V. The DSO was: In September 1917, he fought in the Third Battle of Ypres (the Battle of Passchendaele). For this he was mentioned in dispatches. In the weeks leading up to the conflict, there was a great deal of preparation for the possibility of mustard gas attack: an instruction in gas drill and numerous gas drills. Gas-proof doors and windows were installed as they did engineering works on buildings. The preparations proved to be necessary: there were nerve gas attacks on five different occasions in March 1918. On 21 March 1918, the war diary records: In August 1918 Savage fought in the Battle of Amiens. He was stationed at Vaire-sous-Corbie in the Picardy region. On three occasions it was recommended that he be promoted to colonel, but he was considered too young. =World War II= During World War II Savage led the Brookfield Voluntary Defence Corps. Career as a farmer and agricultural administrator Upon his return from military service, he used his entire earnings from the war (¬£1000) to buy a farm at Brookfield, near Brisbane. There was no road to the property, so he cut one out of the bush (this road is now known by his name, Savages Road). He lived there for 54 years, growing custard apples, papaws and bananas. He named the property 'Purple Patch', after the patch he wore in his army company (the 3rd AIF Engineers). As a farmer, he became involved in the Committee of Direction (COD) of Fruit Marketing in Queensland. He was elected chairman in 1937, serving until 1967 as chairman, then until 1973 as vice-Chairman, when he retired.Major Percival Savage, with Marjorie Savage, ANZAC Day 1974 In 1947, Savage (together with Bernard Flewell-Smith, the General Manager of the COD) oversaw the establishment of a pineapple cannery at Northgate, Brisbane. In 1964 they established the cannery as a separate business (now known as Golden Circle). It was split off from the COD by an amendment to the Fruit Marketing Organisation Acts. In 1969 he was awarded an MBE, for his services to the fruit and vegetable industry of Queensland. Death In late 1975 Savage was diagnosed with cerebral atherosclerosis and dementia. He retired to the Pinjarra Nursing home, run by the Department of Veteran's Affairs. He died on 26 June 1976. Savage's ashes were buried at the root of a bottle tree in his front yard in Kenmore. His wife Marjorie commented that she'd had no idea he was so sentimental. Her ashes were buried there years later in 1985 when she died. Savage was the subject of a museum exhibition in the Brookfield District Museum in 2015, commemorating the centenary of the landing at Gallipoli.

There are specific rationales which are driving the internationalisation and strategies which are being used in the internationalisation of the high education institutions (HEIs).  Internationalization rationales  There are three rationales of internationalization: idealism, instrumentalism and educationalism. = Idealism = An idealist rationale of internationalization in higher education can generate a more democratic, fair and equal world with regard to international cooperation. = Instrumentalism = The second rationale is consistent with its practical and economic goals. This rationale influences policy-makers on developing the level of transparency and mobilization between national educational systems, enabling and simplifying the mobility of people and integrating university degrees, grading systems etc. According to instrumentalists, higher education is a way of increasing profit, ensuring economic boost and sustainable development and transferring ideologies of governments, transnational corporations, stakeholders or supranational regimes. Furthermore, higher education is required to meet the demands of the capitalist and global world. In this respect, universities espousing internationalization are more likely to promote their country‚Äôs competitiveness in the global academic arena. Instrumentalism can be contrasted with idealism in terms of hidden ideocultural goals. = Educationalism = Educationalists accept internationalization in higher education (HE) as a way of broadening the academic experiences of students and academic staff.  Internationalization Preparedness  Preparedness for internationalization of higher education can be understood better at two levels; organizational and systemic. Organizational preparedness includes structural preparedness, functional and administrative preparedness, academic preparedness and cultural preparedness. Systemic preparedness is about political will and support to internationalization, economic and financial support by the state, administrative and regulatory mechanism that is conducive for globalized outlook and importantly, social structures that enable.Inamdar, N.(2019). Transcending Boundaries in Higher Education: Are We Really Ready?. In Bhat, H.V., & Inamdar, N. (Ed.), Internationalization of Higher Education: The Dynamics of Educational Ecology (pp. 9-32). Manipal: Manipal Universal Press.  Internationalization Strategies  = Academic strategies = Academic strategies focus on academic programmes, research and scholarly collaboration, external relations: domestic and cross-border and extra-curricular activities. = Organizational strategies = Organisational strategies include governance, operations, services and human resources. Governance mainly focuses on the active participation of faculty and staff, recognition of the international dimension in institutional mission/mandate statements and in planning, management. Additionally, it indicates the importance of operations which highlights appropriate organizational structures, systems for coordination, communication and cooperation, adequate financial support and resource allocation systems.  Internationalization Categories  The internationalization of higher education can be divided into two processes: = Internationalization at Home = As a response to domestic postsecondary students lacking opportunities with cross cultural experiences, schools have developed on campus internationalization efforts to promote a global student identity. Examples of on-campus cultural learning opportunities include: internationalizing the curriculum, developing inter-cultural research projects, collaborating with local minority groups, and promoting interactions amongst domestic and international students. = Crossborder Internationalization = Crossborder internationalization is \\"the movement of people, programs, providers, policies, knowledge, ideas, projects and services across national boundaries.\\" Traditionally, crossborder internationalization was demonstrated through student mobility, but now postsecondary institutions are borrowing and implementing foreign programs within their own campus. This demonstrates how internationalization efforts involve the exchange of both people and ideas to new countries.  Impacts of Internationalization  = Economic Impacts = Considered to be a product of and response to globalization, internationalization has an economic orientation. Within the Anglo-American tradition of higher education, internationalization is increasingly associated with commodification and commercialization of postsecondary education. There is international competition for recruitment amongst postsecondary institutions to recruit foreign students from privileged countries in order to generate revenue, secure national profile, and build international reputation. Anglophone postsecondary institutions benefit from international students enrolling at their school due to the higher tuition fees for foreign students. International students contribute to their host country's economy through their tuition fees and their living costs during their study period. = Social Impacts = Postsecondary institutions promote interactions between international and domestic students to develop their cultural fluency skills in preparation for a globalized future. The rise of internationalization has meant students from countries with limited access to domestic higher education opportunities are able to access and obtain their education in a foreign country. Postsecondary institutions that offer internationalization experiences, whether crossborder or within their own campus, are viewed as more prestigious and competitive than schools who have limited international mobility initiatives. = Academic Impacts = The rise of international students at postsecondary institutions has led to faculty adapting their teaching style and content delivery to better fit diverse student needs, especially language gaps, within the classroom. These academic modifications include providing diversity focused materials, promoting cross cultural collaboration in class, avoiding colloquial language, and presenting images/visual material to support lecture content.  Challenges of Internationalization  The internationalization of higher education can pose several challenges: * Western postsecondary institutions have been tasked with developing culturally relevant support services for the rising diverse international student population. * Cross cultural research projects and research collaborations are difficult when language barriers are present between the countries working together. * At the institutional level, internationalization efforts can be hindered when senior staff do not reach a consensus about the definition of internationalization and the steps needed to undertake the process. * International students pay inflated tuition fees when compared to domestic students, which can act as a barrier for international study opportunities. * The popularity of internationalizing higher education has led to the creation of private and non-accredited education companies offering unregulated courses and programs.

Capital  It is said that Sammanthurai, a town in present Ampara district was the primary capital of Batticaloa region until the colonial period. Portuguese built a fort in 1628 against the union of Kandy kings and Dutch merchants at Puliyanthivu where the present Batticaloa town is situated. However, Portuguese were defeated in the war with the alliance of Kandyan and Dutch Company in 1638 and the fort was captured by the dutch. Since that , Puliyanthivu became the administrative capital of the District until the independence of the island in 1948.

It usually occurs as a large shrub but under ideal conditions can grow into a tree up to tall. It is an adaptable species in cultivation and a number of cultivars have been developed. Description Melaleuca bracteata is a bushy-foliaged, small to medium tree, normally tall but occasionally taller and it usually flowers and sets seed by the time it is tall. Its bark is rough and dark grey in colour. The leaves are narrow, lance- shaped to linear, long by wide with no stalk, or a very short stalk. The leaves are spirally arranged around the stem and crowded together. The upper surface of the leaf is hairy, especially when young, with many oil-dots. The black tea-tree flowers profusely. Flowers are loosely arranged in clusters to form cylindrical or ovoid spikes, long by about across, coloured cream or white. Each flower usually has a leaf at its base and the petals are shed soon after the flower opens. Flowering occurs from spring to early summer and is followed by fruit which are more or less spherical to oval or barrel-shaped, about in diameter, sparsely arranged along the branches. Melaleuca bracteata near Mount IsaMelaleuca bracteata fruit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca bracteata was first described in 1858 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from a specimen collected near Moreton Bay in Queensland. The specific epithet (bracteata) is derived from the Latin word bractea, meaning \\"bract\\". Distribution and habitat Black tea-tree occurs in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and from north-east Queensland southwards to the Macleay River in New South Wales. It grows near the coast and inland, along stream banks and in wet sites. In New South Wales it has been recorded on the Northern Tablelands, North Coast and North West Slopes biogeographic regions. In Western Australia it occurs in the Kimberley and in the Carnarvon and Pilbara biogeographic regions. There are also disjunct populations in South Australia. Conservation status This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" in Western Australia by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Uses =Horticulture= M. bracteata is a useful tree in cultivation because it will grow almost anywhere and because of its compact shape and many flowers.

Prelude On the night of 18/19 March the Vietcong 1st Regiment overran the ARVN 936th Regional Force Company outpost at Hill 141 northwest of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i, the ARVN 2nd Division commander General L√£m decided to send a reaction force to retake the outpost. The 120 man ARVN force collected from Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i by helicopters from HMM-261, but as they approached the outpost they were met with heavy machine gun fire damaging 8 of 10 helicopters and only 3 helicopters were able to land to offload their troops. Given the heavy fire encountered the decision was made to abort the operation and while Marine jets bombed the outpost, the helicopters returned to evacuate the ARVN troops. General L√£m then approached the 3rd Marine Division commander General Wood B. Kyle to mount a joint operation to retake the outpost. On 19 March General L√£m and Colonel Oscar F. Peatross planned an operation similar to the recently concluded Operation Utah. The plan called for the 3rd Battalion 7th Marines and the ARVN 5th Airborne Battalion to be deployed by helicopters, 4 km west of Hill 141 and advance east in 2 columns to retake the Hill. Operation =20 March= On the morning of 20 March after preparatory air and artillery strikes, helicopters from Marine Aircraft Group 36 landed the Marine and ARVN units at the landing zone west of Hill 141 and began moving east. Company I 3/7 Marines was landed on Hill 141 where they found the bodies of 31 of the defenders. In the afternoon, Colonel Paul X. Kelley, commander of the 2nd Battalion 4th Marines, one of the operation's reserve units visited the 7th Marines command post and suggested that the Vietcong may have moved east from Hill 141 towards the coast and it was decided that this area should be searched. =21 March= On the morning of 21 March 3/7 Marines moved southeast from Hill 141, 2/4 Marines was landed by helicopter southeast near the hamlet of Phuoc Dinh (2), while the ARVN 2nd Battalion 5th Regiment and an APC Company advanced southwest from Binh Son and the 3rd Battalion 5th Regiment advanced northwest from the direction of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i. The helicopters carrying 2/4 Marines were met with heavy machine gun fire and Company F, the first to land had to repulse Vietcong attacks on the landing zone. Artillery fire was called in on Phuoc Dinh (2) and at 12:30 2/4 Marines began their attack on the village with Company D attacking from the north and Companies E and F attacking east. As the Marines began their assault on the village helicopter gunships from VMO-6 saw numerous Vietcong moving within defensive positions and the Marines were met by intense small arms fire. Company E penetrated the first layer of defenses but soon discovered 3 more lines of bunkers and barbed wire, while Company D was unable to penantrate the defenses. The 2/4 Marine command group was caught in a crossfire which killed or wounded 14 Marines and COL Kelley called for napalm strikes immediately in front of his positions. By 16:00 51 airstrikes and 1346 artillery rounds had been directed against the Vietcong positions and 2/4 Marines were able to disengage. Approximately 2 km north of Phuoc Dinh (2), 3/7 Marines encountered an estimated 2 Companies of Vietcong in bunker positions, after a 3-hour battle the Vietcong broke contact. At 16:00 the operational reserve 3rd Battalion 1st Marines and the ARVN 2nd Division Strike Company were deployed by helicopter to Xuan Hoa hamlet 1.5 km southeast of Phuoc Dinh (2). As they approached the landing zone a UH-34 from HMM-163 was hit by machine gun fire and crashed killing 7 Marines and 3 crew. As they approached Xuan Hoa the force encountered well entrenched Vietcong who engaged them until nightfall when they slipped away. North of Phuoc Dinh (2), the ARVN 5th Airborne and APC Company encountered a Vietcong Battalion near the hamlet of Khanh My (3), the Vietcong repulsed two ARVN attacks immobilising 9 M113s. =22 March= Brigadier General Lowell English assumed command of the Marine forces, now renamed Task Force Delta. The Marines and ARVN resumed their attack at dawn but encountered little opposition as the Vietcong had slipped away during the night. The bodies of 168 Vietcong dead were found in Phuoc Dinh (2). BG English decided to extend the operation towards the south. =23 March= In the afternoon 3/7 Marines was lifted by helicopter 9 km south to Phuoc Loc village. As the Marines advanced on the village they were met by well- entrenched Vietcong in a battle that lasted until nightfall. The Marines called in supporting fire and over 2000 artillery rounds were dropped on the village. =24 March= In the morning 3/7 Marines secured the village, the Vietcong had once again slipped away during the night using an extensive tunnel network. The Marines had lost 7 dead and 56 wounded while Vietcong losses were estimated at 60 dead. Northeast of Phuoc Loc the ARVN engaged a Vietcong force killing 40. Aftermath Operation Texas concluded on 25 March, the Marines had suffered 99 dead and 212 wounded and claiming that the Vietcong had 283 killed. Casualties for the ARVN are unknown. On 28 March the ARVN 3rd Battalion 5th Regiment was attacked 1.5 km east of Phuoc Loc village. The Marines launched Operation Indiana deploying the 1st Battalion 7th Marines by helicopter to support the ARVN and encountered an estimated Vietcong Battalion near the hamlet of Vinh Loc (2). The Marines renewed their assault on Vinh Loc (2) the next day supported by 2nd Battalion 7th Marines but the Vietcong had abandoned the village during the night leaving 69 dead, while the ARVN claimed to have killed a further 100. Marine losses were 11 dead and 45 wounded.

The only known specimen was captured in 1995 and remained unnoticed in a museum until 2006. Description The species name paradoxus was given because the seahorse is very different from all of the other members of genus Hippocampus; the seahorse is paradoxical. It is most closely related to another seahorse, H. minotaur. Like all seahorses, this species is sexually dimorphic. It is theorized that the brood pouch is attached on the ventral side of the seahorse, near the top of the tail and connecting to the seahorse's chest. This theory is based on its similarity to H. minotaur, but has not been confirmed because a male specimen has not been collected. The only known specimen is a female, and has a vertical height of 6.5 cm. This species has 8 trunk rings and 11 pectoral fin rays. A series of lobes that resemble small fins make up the majority of this fish's body. The lobes start near the midline of the seahorse's trunk and continue to the end of the seahorse's tail. The first lobe does resemble a small dorsal fin, but it is not one. Unlike all of the other members of its genus, this species of seahorse lacks a dorsal fin. The holotype is yellow-cream in color, and it is covered with small brown spots. It is possible that the color of the specimen has changed while the body was preserved inside of formaldehyde, so the actual color of this animal in the wild is unknown. Distribution The holotype was discovered south-west of Esperance, Western Australia, on the western periphery of the Great Australian Bight. The exact coordinates of the specimen's collection was near . Habitat This species was collected at a depth near 102 m (335 ft). The collection site was in the benthic zone, at the bottom of the ocean, near the substrate (which in this case was sand). The collection site was full of different types of bryozoans, lace corals and sponges. Waters at the collection site are relatively warm.

This temple has great historical and cultural importance in Hinduism since the ancient Hindu epic Ramcharitmanas was originally written at this place by Hindu poet-saint, reformer and philosopher Goswami Tulsidas in the 16th century (c. 1532‚Äì1623). History One of the famous Hindu epics, Ramayan was originally written in Sanskrit language by Sanskrit poet Valmiki between 500 and 100 BC. Being in Sanskrit language, this epic was not accessible to and understood by masses. In the 16th century, Goswami Tulsidas wrote the Ramayan in Awadhi dialect of Hindi language and the Awadhi version was called Ramcharitmanas (meaning Lake of the deeds of Rama). In 1964, the Sureka family constructed a temple at the same place where Goswami Tulsidas wrote Ramcharitmanas. Construction Construction finished in 1964 and was funded by the Thakur Das Sureka family of Bandhaghat, Howrah ,West Bengal. The temple was constructed in white marble and landscaping all around the temple. Verses and scenes (pictorials) from Ramcharitmanas are engraved on the marble walls all over the temple.

Historical importance Due to Ramcharitmanas, the epic Ramayan was read by larger number of people, who otherwise could not have read Ramayan since it was in Sanskrit.

It was designed by Richard Gailey and built from 1887 to 1918. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 April 1999.  History  This three- storeyed brick warehouse was constructed in 1887 for the successful Brisbane plumbing firm of Watson Brothers. It was designed by prominent Brisbane architect Richard Gailey, who in the 1880s and 1890s made a substantial contribution to Brisbane's central business district with his designs for commercial and industrial buildings such as shops, offices, hotels, warehouses and factories. Watson Brothers Plumbing and Gasfitting Company was established by George Watson, senior, a Glasgow plumber who migrated to Brisbane in 1862, and by the mid-1860s had established a small plumbing business in Albert Street. In 1880 George retired leaving his four sons: George Watson, junior, Thomas, James and John Douglas, to continue the business. By the mid-1880s the firm, now known as Watson Brothers, was well established as plumbers, gasfitters and galvanised iron and lead works, with workshops in Edward Street and stores and an office in Eagle Street. George Watson Jnr was soon to take a prominent role in Brisbane's civic affairs: he was an alderman on the Brisbane Municipal Council from 1891 to 1896, and Mayor of Brisbane 1892-93. Queensland's economic \\"high\\" of the 1880s produced an unprecedented building boom, especially in Brisbane. Watson Brothers plumbing and sanitary supplies business flourished, and in late 1885 the brothers purchased land in Margaret Street to accommodate a larger warehouse and workshop. Importantly, the site remained central and was close to the wharves along Eagle Street and Petrie Bight. Watson Brothers' 1887 building was erected during a period of great change in the low-lying, swampy district of inner Brisbane known as Frog's Hollow - the ground between George and Edward Streets, bounded on the west by Elizabeth Street and on the east by Alice Street. The area was farmed by convict labour during the penal settlement of the 1820s and 1830s, and in the 1840s and 1850s was sparsely settled with cottages erected on the higher land. In the busy post-Separation decades of the 1860s and 1870s, an ad hoc process of land filling was undertaken as Frog's Hollow became more densely populated by the working classes, and shophouses, house-workshops, small factories or workshops, boarding houses and hotels were erected. During the boom years of the 1880s, these residences and small workshops were replaced gradually with large and imposing commercial and industrial premises, as Frog's Hollow, conveniently located near the wharves, emerged as Brisbane's principal light- industrial and warehousing precinct. Factories and workshops specialising in clothing, footwear, saddlery, furniture, building, printing, brewing, milling, confectionery or biscuit manufacture, coachmaking, ship-fitting and metal- working, as well as substantial importer and manufacturer warehousing, either were established or expanded. By the late 1880s, engineering and ironfounding firms were particularly prominent in the lower Edward, Alice and Margaret Streets precinct, and included Smellie & Co., Smith, Forrester & Co., Harvey Sargeant & Co., and Overend & Co. Watson Brothers incorporated a small workshop at the rear of their 1887 warehouse, which was appropriately located in the metal-working precinct of Frog's Hollow. The Watson Brothers Building (1887), with its three storeys and ornate facade, was one of the more imposing of the Frog's Hollow warehouses. The upper level of a two level workshop at the rear of the property was accessed by a laneway at the side of the building. Similar warehouses/factories erected at this period included the 1887 speculative warehouse at the corner of Edward and Mary Streets (later Coal Board Building); Smellie & Co.'s 1888-89 warehouse at the corner of Edward and Alice Streets (now Old Mineral House); and George Myers & Co.'s warehouse (1889‚Äì90) in Edward Street (now the Metro Arts Theatre). All four were designed by architect Richard Gailey. Gailey conducted a highly successful and prolific architectural practice in Brisbane for nearly 60 years, from 1865 until his death in 1924. While hotels were his speciality - he designed or modified over 30 in Brisbane alone in the period 1869-95 - he also designed a large number of substantial, often highly decorative, warehouses and office buildings, and contributed significantly to the re- building of Brisbane in the 1880s as a prosperous, late Victorian city. Some of Gailey's other boom-era central city work survives, including the Tara House for the Irish Club (1877-1879) in Elizabeth Street; Colonial Mutual Life Building (1882‚Äì83) in Queen Street; Treasury Chambers (1885‚Äì86) in George and Elizabeth Streets (Elizabeth Street now a facade); and Finney Isles & Co.'s (1887) store at the corner of Edward and Adelaide Streets. Some of his CBD buildings have survived as facades only: Telegraph Newspaper Company offices (1878) in Queen Street (now part of the Myer Centre facade); the former Allan and Stark Building (1881-82 & 1885) on the opposite side of Queen Street; and Hill's Buildings (1888‚Äì89) in Queen Street, Petrie Bight (later the Queensland Country Life Building). Gailey was architect to the Bank of New South Wales, the Brisbane Grammar School (from 1882) and the Children's Hospital (from 1883). A staunch Baptist, he designed the Baptist City Tabernacle (1889‚Äì90) at the corner of Wickham Terrace and Upper Edward Street and numerous suburban (mostly non-conformist Protestant) churches. Some of his better-known Brisbane residential work includes the alterations and additions to Fernberg (1888‚Äì90) at Paddington (now Government House); and Moorlands (1892) at Toowong. Gailey's work was not confined to Brisbane, and examples of his work survive throughout Queensland. He was a prolific designer, whose decorative detailing retains its popular appeal. He was also a successful businessman and property developer, took a keen interest in civic, church and benevolent affairs, served on numerous committees and boards, was a prominent freemason, and was a foundation vice-president of the Queensland Institute of Architects in 1889-90. Gailey was at the forefront of the re-development of Brisbane in the 1880s, and his significance cannot be underestimated. Ground floor: originally warehouse, carriageway, and offices Watson Brothers' 1887 building was erected by contractors Smith and Balls (Henry Smith and John Irwin Balls), who had tendered with a price of ¬£4500. When the provision and execution of the metal work by Watson Brothers was included, however, the actual cost of construction was over ¬£6,000. When completed in October 1887, the building was described as a handsome three-storied pile, of brick with ornamental facade. [Queensland Figaro 22 October 1887:647] It had a frontage of to Margaret Street and a depth of . The ground floor was divided into 3 sections: * warehousing space on the north side * a central carriage way which permitted wagons and carts to access the rear yard * offices, with a storeroom behind, on the south side The second floor was partitioned by three masonry walls with archway access between, and served as showrooms. The third storey contained a single, undivided space utilised as the packing and unpacking department. There were three rear doors on the second and third levels, and American lifts were installed to permit goods to be hoisted to or from the back yard. A shed and workshop, fitted with machinery and racks, was located at the rear of the yard - (this structure was two-storeyed by 1918, and probably by 1913) - and along the northern wall of the yard were out-offices and a three-stalled stables. In October 1887, a month before they opened, Watson Brothers advertised half to two-thirds of the building for lease. In subsequent years the firm occupied the entire warehouse. Despite serious flooding in 1893 and an economic depression in the 1890s, by the turn of the century Watson Brothers had emerged as Queensland's largest plumbing and sanitary engineering business. In 1907 a retail plumbing supply and general hardware branch store was opened in Queen Street, and in 1918 a new plumbing workshop was erected on land adjoining the rear of the Margaret Street property, facing Alice Street. During the First World War, Watson Brothers carried out plumbing alterations to 90% of all vessels converted to troopships in Queensland and sent tradesmen to Sydney for the same task; during the Second World War the firm provided equipment for Australian and American forces in Brisbane. The business remained a family enterprise until 1961 when it was forced into liquidation. The Margaret Street property was sold in 1963 to Margaret Street Holdings and transferred to Orb Holdings in 1978. During the early 1980s the building was occupied by the Queensland Ballet Company. In 2015, the former warehouse and central carriageway of the ground floor was used for car parking and the former ground floor offices was used as a cafe. The upper floors are divided into a number of small tenancies.  Description  Watson Brothers Building is a three-storeyed brick warehouse with a rendered facade. It consists of three equal portions across. The ground floor section of the two northern portions have been removed for vehicular access, but dividing walls remain extending to the rear of the building. The surviving southern portion has three segmental arched openings. The left two openings are now recessed doorways and the other a window. Originally the most northern portion had a similar arrangement of openings while the central portion had a window to one side and large opening for carriage access to the rear. The pilasters to each side of the surviving southern ground floor portion are rendered to imitate stone coursework capped with mouldings and rosettes. Above this is a cornice with small dentils separating the upper two floors from the ground floor. Central archway on the parapet The three portions are divided on the two upper levels by fluted giant order pilasters with ornate Corinthian capitals that include grotesque masks. The first floor windows have segmental arches and the ones on the top floor are semi-circular. The arches are embellished with hood and label mouldings and decorated key stones. These openings have balustrading in their lower portion. A line of rosettes between pilasters separates the two upper floors. The words \\"WATSON BROS. LIMITED\\" appear painted on the frieze below the parapet. Centred on the parapet of each portion is a closed-off arch below a small triangular pediment and flanked by florid scrolls. An open balustrade links these and other solid sections of parapet which support urns, visually separating the three distinct parts of the building at parapet level. The central archway contains the words \\"WATSONS 1887 BUILDINGS\\". The side and back walls are unpainted brickwork. No trace remains of an earlier post- supported street awning (extant by , but not part of the original design) with its curved corrugated iron roof and central archway. On the side wall facing the laneway it is still possible to distinguish signwriting describing Watson's goods - hardware and plumbing supplies. The laneway provides a link across the city block and has a visual quality contributed to by the unrendered expanse of the side of the building. The rear elevation of the building is visually divided into three distinct portions relating to those of the front, each with a gable end. These have large central openings running through all levels and loading gantries located centrally above, although the central gantry has been removed. Smaller individual windows are situated to either side of each large opening on the upper two levels. To the rear of the warehouse, and separated from it by an open courtyard, is a two storeyed building open to the north west. This timber framed structure is supported on all sides but the north west, on stone walls bounding the property line and in sections acting as retaining walls. These stone walls, of squared porphyry rubble laid in courses, are extended in height by two generations of brickwork additions which support the triangular timber trusses of the corrugated iron skillion roof. The walls and concrete floor of the courtyard bear evidence of earlier buildings on this site through a series of recesses left by the removal of earlier timber framing members, likely to be from early stables on the site. Internally, large open areas of timber flooring still exist, but some internal partitioning has been added. From the new vehicular access ways the timber joists and herring-bone strutting of the floor above can be clearly seen. Some evidence of closed-off arched openings exist in the dividing walls at ground floor level.  Heritage listing  Watson Brothers Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Watson Brothers Building is important in illustrating the rise to prominence of local Queensland manufacturing and enterprise during the 1880s boom period, and demonstrates the evolution of Frog's Hollow as the principal warehousing and light-industrial sector of Brisbane's central business district during the second half of the 19th century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The site includes a late 19th century yard and remnant evidence of the original stables and out-offices, and a workshop extant by , the survival of which in Brisbane's central business district is a now rare aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Watson Brothers Building is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an 1880s boom era warehouse with ornate detailing. It is one of a group of warehouses of similar scale and materials erected in Frog's Hollow during the late 1880s-early 1890s, which contribute to our understanding of late 19th century concerns with promoting commerce and industry through substantial and imposing building design. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Watson Brothers Building is significant for its streetscape contribution to Margaret Street in terms of the scale and rhythm of its facade, and the presence of a laneway exposing much of the northern side of the building. The highly decorative facade, intact above the ground floor, retains its aesthetic appeal. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building is significant for its special association with local Brisbane plumbing firm Watson Brothers [earlier George Watson] and its contribution to Queensland's building industry for nearly a century. The building is also a fine example of the commercial work of influential Brisbane architect Richard Gailey, whose Brisbane [Queensland] practice spanned nearly 6 decades and who made a particularly significant contribution to the Brisbane townscape in the 1880s and 1890s.

In the 1880 general election he had narrowly beaten his Conservative fellow MP, Alexander William Hall. Harcourt's campaign, particularly his acceptance speech, were regarded as insulting.

Early life MacDonald was born at Campbelltown, New South Wales to Alexander Macdonald and his wife Sarah (n√©e Warby). He was educated at The King's School, Parramatta, and gained farming experience before heading to the Victorian goldfields and later becoming manager of Ingleby station near Geelong.MacDonald, Peter Fitzallan (1830‚Äì1919) -- Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 1 March 2015. He arrived in Queensland in 1857 and soon set out on a series of pastoral explorations with fellow squatters and aboriginal guides with the plan of taking up as many leases as possible. In May 1859 while living at Yaamba, he joined his brother John Graham MacDonald on an exploration tour of the head waters of the Nogoa and Belyando Rivers, where they took up a large area of pastoral country. One such property, Cullinlaringo, which he had sold to Horatio Wills in 1860, was the scene where the Cullin-La-Ringo massacre occurred in 1861. MacDonald was one of the group who set out to avenge the slaughter. Politics MacDonald entered state politics in 1873, winning the seat of Blackall. A supporter of Samuel Griffith, he supported secular education and liberal land legislation. In 1869, he sued The Crown for resuming western leaseholds he owned. Known as \\"The Great Northern Run\\", the case dragged on until in 1880 he was awarded ¬£22,700. For this he was attacked for using the parliament to further his own interests as opposed to his constituents. In 1876 he announced he was sick of politics and did not stand for re-election in 1878. He stood for the seat of Rockhampton North in 1888 but was defeated by Rees Jones. Later life MacDonald became more conservative and in 1890-1891, he set out to thwart the Shearer's union by employing non-union labor. As well as his pastoral leases, he purchased hotels throughout Queensland as well as the Northern Argus newspaper and a meat works at Lakes Creek, both based in Rockhampton. Personal life In Geelong in 1861 he married Julia Louise Ayrey, the orphaned daughter of a wealthy Western District pastoralist and together they had seven children. MacDonald died in Rockhampton in 1919 and was buried at Yaamba Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and two daughters.

Rethinking the Asian American Movement (American Social and Political Movements of the 20th Century. N.p.: Routledge, 2011. Print. When WMS first formed, many members identified themselves as Marxists and the group consisted of many different groups of people. They were primarily the working class, students and bourgeois. The organization focused on Asian American activism, serving as one of the larger Asian American organizations at the time. Asian American activists strived to create their own unique identity through a blend of American and Asian traits. WMS members strived to establish independent cultural identities instead of assimilating into American culture. Asian Americans in WMS believed imperialism was to blame for the oppression of Asians in America. American culture was extended and prominent, and they felt they had to assimilate. Those who did adjust to American culture chose to acculturate, still trying to preserve their Asian identities. Organizations like WMS were significant at the time because of the increasing numbers of Asian Americans resisting racialization. In the 1990s, the organization commonly met in the International Hotel in San Francisco, the hot spot for Asian American organizations to meet. The International Hotel housed many low- income Chinese and Filipino families, which was a contributing reason for the large Asian community present at the time. WMS used culture as a political tool to overcome western imperialism and to conserve identities. Through entertainment of creating music, lyrics and skits, WMS was able to educate the community about the cultural identity of Asians in America. Overview WMS was fueled by the Revolutionary UnionHamilton, S. (1979). On the History of the Revolutionary Union. In P. Saba (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism (13th ed.). Retrieved from (https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/periodicals/theoretical- review/19791302.htm) in the 1900s, which later became the Revolutionary Communist Party. Participants in the movement somewhat tolerated communism at the time, but were striving to move away from it and more towards anti- imperialism due to colonization.Maeda, D. J. (2009). Chains of Babylon: The Rise of Asian America. N.p.: University of Minnesota Press. WMS worked with other organizations to express political radicalism. This concept was first adopted from the Black Panthers. Western imperialism was heavy in Asian countries. As a means of colonization, the United States pushed their power, influence and policies onto Asian countries. WMS was one of the organizations that revealed the connection of racism to western influence in Asia. The organization made decisions by membership and started at a local community level before branching into organizational methods. Rallies, protests and public demonstrations were usually assembled for purposes such as identifying the struggles of unionization. Workers were oppressed by imperialism and strived to establish movements for benefits such as better working conditions. Areas of Work Some of the areas in which WMS worked were:What is Wei Min She? (2007, December 14). Asian American Movement 1968. Retrieved from (http://aam1968.blogspot.com/2007/12/what-is-wei-min-she.html) Building labor struggles: Asian workers faced many struggles and were often mistreated because of immigration stereotypes. Immigrant workers had limited work protection compared to other working classes. They also had to work long hours without compensation. Most of them worked extra hours only to get paid the lowest wage. This area of work focused on Asian workers uniting with the larger working class to stand against imperialism and inequality in the workforce. Student organizing: Events and programs pushed by students were prominent in the Asian American activism movement. WMS helped student organizations raise awareness for ethnic group studies and anti-imperialism. With guidance and support, student organizations, a critical body mass, were able to coordinate and execute events important for the progression of the movement. Fighting for democratic rights: Democratic rights that WMS fought for included but were not limited to health issues, housing concerns, educational rights and equal employment opportunities. Building relationships with the U.S and China: WMS created environments for open discussion and forums supporting harmony between China and the U.S. Building struggle against oppression of women: WMS appealed to feminism by wanting equal rights for men and women. The organization emphasized support systems for women in the workforce, women and childcare, and participated in events that raised awareness for those issues. Intersectionality During the 1900s, minority ethnic groups collaborated to build unity and solidarity in the community. African Americans and Asian Americans worked through WMS and Black Panthers to resist western imperialism. Organizations like WMS and Asian Americans for Action combined had large numbers, which later inspired other minority ethnic groups. However, the Black power movement had a huge influence on Asian American activism. Asian Americans sought inspiration in the Black power movement as both groups rejected assimilation to the dominant culture of whites. At first, many people were critical of WMS adopting tactics from the Black Panthers because they believed Asian Americans were racist. Alliances formed between the two races at the time showed coexistence, which was supportive for organizations like WMS to build resilience. It was not uncommon for large minority ethnic groups to live in the same areas as each other, making it easier to support one another. Areas such as Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles were prime locations for organizations like WMS to reach out to other communities for solidarity and support. Minority groups united through their experiences of assimilation and resistance to whiteness. Rivalries WMS had other organizational rivalries. One was the Red Guard Party, a Chinese-American formed organization. The Red Guard Party was also primarily active in the Asian American Movement. Another organization known as rivalry to WMS was I Wor Kuen.I Wor Kuen: Opportunism in the Asian Movement . (n.d.). In Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line. Retrieved February 27, 2015, from https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/periodicals/iwk-journal/iwk- wms-ru/section2.htm Similar to the Red Guards Party, I Wor Kuen also pulled ideals of political movement from the Black Panthers. The organization also formed community protests centered on Marxist Asian American ideals.Wei, W. (2010). The Asian American Movement. N.p.: Temple University Press. Although WMS had rivalry organizations, the majority of Asian American organizations at the time contributed to the Asian American activist movement in compelling ways.

Early life From 1976 to 1983 he studied Protestant theology and pre- and early history in Bonn and Marburg. Followed by a position as a scientific assistant at the University of Marburg from 1983 to 1985 and as an employee at the Bavarian State Office for the Preservation of Historical Monuments from 1985 to 1989. In 1988 he followed his fascination for aviation and photography and got his private pilot licence. Since then he has been working as an aerial archaeologist with the focus on Bavaria. Furthermore, he had lectureships at the Universities of Marburg, W√ºrzburg and the Ruhr- University Bochum. He founded the publishing company Verlag Marie Leidorf, one of the larger German-language publishers for archaeological literature. Besides the tracing of countless undiscovered ancient monuments his interest rises for the aerial documentation. Since the turnaround he took photos of the German Green Belt, the former border between East and West Germany, in the years 1996, 2003 and 2008. Besides his documental work, he has accumulated a vast collection of artistic photographs from the birds eye view. They show the artistic-aesthetic survey of the manmade landscape and nature. His intuition for those structures and characteristics is unmistakable. His photos have been published in several calendars and books.

His parents died when he was young and both he and his younger brother were cared for by their aunt and uncle. By 1925, he began attending primary school in his village. As he grew older, he expressed a desire to serve God and his vocation led him to the minor seminary of Saint Teresa where he studied for six years until World War II started. During the war, he returned to his village and became a teacher where he opened a school for the village children. In 1946, Mario Vergara arrived for his mission in Myanmar, and he met Ko Lat. He ultimately decided that Ko Lat would join him in his missionary work. After the 1948 independence of Myanmar, he and Vergara were threatened by the guerillas in Myanmar and the two were murdered. Beatification The Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved the cause of beatification which commenced on 23 October 2001. This bestowed upon him the title of Servant of God.

It was established on 25 January 1995 to protect ecosystems and biodiversity of European importance, as well as the traditional cultural, historical and folklore heritage of the region. The altitude varies from on Gradishte Peak to at the Black Sea coast with average length of from west to east and from north to south. The nature park is situated in Burgas Province with two towns, Malko Tarnovo and Ahtopol, and several villages within its territory. It includes five nature reserves: Silkosiya, Sredoka, Tisovitsa, Uzunbodzhak and Vitanovo. Silkosiya is the oldest one in Bulgaria, established in 1933, and Uzunbodzhak is included in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves under the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Programme. The whole territory is part of the network of nature protection areas of the European Union, Natura 2000. Strandzha Nature Park falls within two terrestrial ecoregions of the Palearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forest ‚Äî the Balkan mixed forests and the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests. Forests cover 80% of the park's area, with old-growth forest forming 30% of them. These woods are the last remaining temperate forests with evergreen laurel undergrowth in Europe. The park has the highest number of vertebrate species of all protected areas in Bulgaria, including 66 species of mammals, 269 species of birds, 24 species of reptiles, 10 species of amphibia and 41 species of freshwater fish, as well as 70 species of marine fish in the waters of the Black Sea. The invertebrate fauna is poorly researched and includes 84 Bulgarian endemic species, of which 4 are local, and 34 relict species. The oldest traces of human habitation found in the territory of the park date from the Neolithic period in c. 6000 BC. By the mid-1st millennium BC Strandzha was inhabited by Thracian tribes, forming part of several Thracian kingdoms until the region was annexed by the Roman Empire in 45 AD. In the Middle Ages the area was contested between the Byzantine and the Bulgarian Empires until it was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in the late 14th century. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Strandzha remained in the Ottoman Empire, which resulted in the 1903 Ilinden‚ÄìPreobrazhenie Uprising by the local Bulgarian population. The region was liberated in 1912 during the First Balkan War. The rich history has left an important cultural heritage by several civilizations and folklore traditions unique for Bulgaria, such as Nestinarstvo that involves a barefoot dance on smouldering embers ‚Äî a vestige from the pagan past. Traditional Strandzha wooden architecture from the mid-17th to the 19th century is preserved in the villages of Brashlyan and Kosti, as well as in the town of Malko Tarnovo. Park administration A map of Strandzha nature park Strandzha Nature Park was established on 25 January 1995 to protect ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as the traditional cultural, historical and folklore heritage of the region. Before 1995 the protection of the region had been fragmented, consisting of isolated nature reserves and protected areas. The park is administered by a directorate based in Malko Tarnovo and subordinated to the Executive Forest Agency of the Ministry of Environment and Water of Bulgaria. The directorate implements the state policy for the management and control of the protected area, aiming at the long-term conservation of the unique nature and ensuring the sustainable social and economic development of the region. It monitors the management and conservation of the forests, game, and fish resources while encouraging tourism and environmental protection. The park falls within the International Union for Conservation of Nature management category V (protected landscape/seascape). The whole territory of the park and the adjacent Black Sea waters are included in the European Union network of nature protection areas Natura 2000 under the code Strandzha BG0001007. Strandzha Nature Park is listed as an important bird and biodiversity area by BirdLife International. There are two information centres for visitors: in Malko Tarnovo and in Gramatikovo. Geography =Overview= Strandzha Nature Park is situated entirely in Burgas Province within the territory of two municipalities, Malko Tarnovo and Tsarevo, in the extreme south-eastern corner of Bulgaria. This area includes the 7,000 inhabitants of 19 villages, and the towns of Malko Tarnovo and Ahtopol. Strandzha is the least populated region in Bulgaria with a population density of 10 people per km2. It is accessible through the I-9 first class road to the west and the III-9901 third class road to the east which serves the park coastline. The two roads are linked by the II-99 second class road. With an area of , or approximately 1% of the national territory, the park is the largest protected territory in Bulgaria. Due to the geographic location of Strandzha in the immediate vicinity of Asia, the park contains biodiversity of European importance as well as a unique historical heritage. The vegetation of Strandzha evolved before the formation of the Bosphorus Strait when the whole southern Black Sea coast was linked and represents the westernmost extension of the Euxine-Colchic ecoregion. Because of the proximity of three seas, the Black Sea, the Marmara Sea and the Aegean Sea, Strandzha remained unaffected by the Quaternary glaciation and retained its mild and relatively humid climate. Under those conditions the region has preserved relict species from the Neogene. =Relief, geology and soils= The relief of Strandzha is hilly, characterised by mild rolling ridges covered with dense woods. To the west the mountain is steeper and more rugged. Strandzha Nature Park has two clearly defined ridges ‚Äî Rezovo ridge with its highest summit at Golyamo Gradishte peak at and Bosna ridge with Papia at ) forming the highest elevation. Approximately 38% of the park's territory has an altitude from , 60% from , and only 2% lies above . The mountain is an anticline with core layers formed by igneous and metamorphic rocks with Paleozoic origin and surface strata covered with Mesozoic sediments dating from the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The anticline has an orientation from north-west to south-east. The river valleys are geologically young, formed during the Quaternary, and have gentle slopes and a slight inclination. In the western regions there is an extensive karst area with carbonate rocks spanning from the village of Varovnik to the town of Malko Tarnovo with ponors, caverns and caves. The territory of Strandzha Nature Park falls within the Mediterranean soil area of Europe, characterised by wetter soils in comparison to the rest of Southern Europe. There are seven soil types in the park under the World Reference Base for Soil Resources soil classification ‚Äî Fluvisols (4% of the park's area), Leptosols (10%), Cambisols (4%), Luvisols (46%), Planosols (20%), Alisols (11%) and Nitisols (5%). Strandzha is the only place in Bulgaria where Alisoils are found and the only place in Europe with Nitisols. =Climate= The climate of Strandzha is influenced by the proximity of the Black, Marmara and Aegean seas which clearly distinguishes the local climate from that of the rest of Bulgaria. The region is among the warmest in the country with temperatures rarely falling below 0 ¬∞C in winter and rising above 24 ¬∞C in summer due to the cooling effect of the Black Sea. The average temperature drops with the rising elevation in the interior which creates conditions for more frequent and longer-lasting mists, heavier snowfall and earlier frosts. In winter frequent fogs lead to hard rime and the icing of the forests at altitudes above 50. The winds are predominantly northern. Along the coastline the winds flow from the north in November ‚Äì March, from the east in April ‚Äì August and from the north- east in September ‚Äì October. The sea breeze causes the high frequency of eastern winds in summer. In the interior the predominant wind direction is more varied with northern winds being the most frequent in January ‚Äì March and in October. The annual precipitation is high, reaching in some areas above . Along the coast rainfall is under the influence of the Mediterranean and is characterised with a winter maximum while the higher regions of Strandzha also have a second maximum in May ‚Äì June as a result of the continental climate. In the interior rainfall is higher and influenced by the cold northern and north- eastern winds. There is no natural protection to the north which often results in abrupt temperature falls. Strandzha has a significant potential for climate therapy. Due to the healthy climate along the coastline combined with sandy beaches, Ahtopol was designated a climatic sea resort of national importance and Sinemorets a climatic sea resort of local importance. =Rivers= The mouth of the Veleka river at Sinemorets Strandzha is criss-crossed by a dense network of deep ravines, streams and rivers. The rivers have a discharge maximum in winter, in November ‚Äì December. With a total length of , the Veleka river is the longest and largest in Strandzha. Its upper course has a rocky bottom and many rapids. As the river flows through the karstic region of the mountain, its banks are steep with cliffs and precipices. After the village of Zvezdets, the river valley grows wider, the inclination decreases, the water flow slows and the river creates many meanders. In the lower course the river banks are flooded seasonally forming a wetland forest of alluvial longose groves. The Veleka is navigable in the first up from the river mouth. The second longest river is the Rezovo river, at . It generally flows east and along most of its course forms the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. According to a hypothesis its etymology is linked to the mythological king Rhesus of Thrace. The banks of the river are covered with dense oak and beech forests. The Bulgarian bank is characterised with many cliff formations and caves. The Rezovo river is faster and colder than the Veleka and therefore has a larger trout population. The tributaries of the Veleka include the Mladezhka river (), Mechi Dol (), Katun (), and the main tributary of the Rezovo river is the Delievska river (). Protected areas A forest in Uzunbodzhak Reserve Strandzha Nature Park includes five nature reserves (Silkosiya, Sredoka, Tisovitsa, Uzunbodzhak and Vitanovo), eight natural landmarks, and 14 protected areas. Silkosiya is the first nature reserve in Bulgaria, established in 1933. It is situated to the north of Kosti and to the east of Balgari. It hosts 260 species of vascular plants and forests with average tree age of 120‚Äì130 years. Srednoka is situated in the lower course of the Mechi Dol river and is the only reserve in Strandzha with many meadows and open spaces. Tisovitsa is located in an area with a difficult access along the banks of the homonymous river and features archaeological sites from ancient Thrace. Uzunbodzhak is included in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves under the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Programme and is situated along the border with Turkey. Vitanovo is located on the main Rezovo ridge from Malko Tarnovo and from Brashlyan. Its altitude varies from 400 to 60, making vegetation different from that in the other reserves. Access to the reserves is restricted to research teams, with a few strictly defined tourist trails. Among the most significant protected areas are the Mouth of the Veleka river and Silistar. Silistar is situated on the Black Sea coast between the villages of Sinemorets and Rezovo and has the highest number of plant species per square kilometre in Bulgaria. Biology =Flora= In terms of biogeography the park falls within both the Balkan mixed forests, and the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests terrestrial ecoregions of the Palearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. The combination of climate, specific geographic position and relief, as well as the lack of a strong anthropogenic influence, have contributed to the formation of 130 different habitats, making Strandzha Nature Park first in that indicator among all protected areas in Europe. There are 1670 species of vascular plants which constitute 44% of the total number of species in Bulgaria. Pontic rhododendron, the symbol of Strandzha nature park The vegetation of the park includes many communities of a Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean type: warm oak forests with undergrowth of evergreen sclerophyll shrubs, such as tree heath (Erica arborea), butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus), Rose of Sharon (Hypericum calycinum), green olive tree (Phillyrea latifolia), Cistus incanus, sage-leaved rock rose (Cistus salvifolius), among others. The xerothermic grasslands along the coast and in some areas to the west of the park have replaced forests destroyed by human activity. The most widespread floral communities of that type are dominated by Chrysopogon gryllus, Bothriochloa ischaemum and bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa). The coastal dunes are home to psammophytic vegetation. The river banks are covered with dense forests of black alder (Alnus glutinosa), white willow (Salix alba) and crack willow (Salix fragilis). Deciduous forests cover 80% of the park's area and belong to 28 forest and 18 bush habitats. This variety is due to the lower river valleys, the sea coast and the karstic terrain. These include forests of oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), Strandzhan oak (Quercus hartwissiana), Hungarian oak (Quercus frainetto), common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis) and small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) with undergrowth of pontic rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum), Caucasian whortleberry (Vaccinium arctostaphylos), cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus), Black Sea holly (Ilex colchica), Himalayan meadow primrose (Primula rosea) and common heather (Calluna). There are 64 relict plant species, 6 of which cannot be found elsewhere in the European Union ‚Äî Strandzhan oak, Caucasian whortleberry, Colchic holly, twin-flowered daphne (Daphne pontica), tutsan (Hypericum androsaemum) and H. calycinum. The Pontic rhododendron is the symbol of the park and an important relict species with a highly disjunct areal in Europe where it inhabits only the north-western Iberian Peninsula and Strandzha. There are 56 endemic plant species, including local endemics (Veronica turrilliana and Anthemis jordanovii), western Black Sea coast endemics (Silene caliacrae and Lepidotrichum uechtrizianum), 6 Bulgarian endemics (Pyrus bulgarica, Oenanthe millefolia, Galium bulgaricum, Veronica krumovii, among others) and 40 Balkan endemics, such as Saponaria stranjensis. 113 species are listed in the Red Book of Bulgaria, including several species that within Bulgaria can only be found in the park ‚Äî Ophrys reinholdii, Verbascum bugulifolium, Sideritis syriaca, Cistus laurifolius, among others. =Fauna= Strandzha Nature Park has the richest vertebrate fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria ‚Äî 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among the most common are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech marten. The park protects some of the largest and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European pine marten and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole- rat, G√ºnther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar. Strandzha is situated on Via Pontica, the second-largest bird migratory route in Europe. The bays and estuaries along the Black Sea coast are a wintering destination for some birds. There are 269 avian species in the park, including populations of global importance of white-backed woodpecker, semi-collared flycatcher, olive-tree warbler and sombre tit, as well as populations of European importance of Egyptian vulture, white stork, black stork, Eurasian eagle owl and four eagle species. A landscape of Strandzha nature park There are 24 species of reptiles, 11 of which have a population of global significance. They include red whip snake, Aesculapian snake, European blind snake, sheltopusik (Europe's largest lizard), Kotschy's gecko, European pond turtle, Balkan pond turtle, spur- thighed tortoise, Hermann's tortoise, etc. The sand lizard, which is typical for western Bulgaria but very uncommon to the east, is also present in the park. Ten amphibian species have been recorded, such as European tree frog, eastern spadefoot and southern crested newt. The absence of common reptiles and amphibians, such as fire salamander, common spadefoot and common European viper, is noteworthy. The ichthyofauna of the park is among the richest in Europe with 41 freshwater and brackish water species of fish, as well as 70 marine fish species. There are nine Ponto-Caspian and five boreal relict species. The Ponto-Caspian dates from the ancient Sarmatian Sea. The boreal dates from the epoch of Quaternary cooling. The Black Sea bleak and the Bulgarian minnow are endemic species that can only be found in the Veleka and Rezovska drainages. There are several species restricted to the Black Sea basin (vyrezub, mushroom goby, bighead goby, toad goby, tubenose goby, western tubenose goby and racer goby). The round goby and estuarine perch are found in the Caspian and Black Sea basins. The invertebrate fauna is poorly studied. There are 80 Bulgarian and 4 local endemics, as well as 34 relict species. Cultural heritage =History= A view of the Thracian rock sanctuary of Beglik Tash, situated on Maslen nos cape, at several kilometers to the north of the park The documented history of Strandzha dates back several millennia. The oldest traces of human habitation are stone axes and ceramic fragments found in the Ahtopol peninsula and are dated from the Neolithic period (c. 6000‚Äî3000 BC). Since the mid-1st millennium BC the mountain was inhabited by the Thracian tribes Thyni and Asti and was part of the Odrysian kingdom. The Thracians of Strandzha were infamous for their pirate raids. By the 2nd century BC, the power of the Odrysian kingdom declined and it became a client state of the Roman Republic. However, it kept its independence until 46 BC, when it was annexed by the Roman Empire, forming the province of Thracia. The region remained part of the Roman Empire and its successor the Byzantine Empire. In Roman times, Strandzha was a centre of copper and iron ore mining and metallurgy. In the late 6th and early 7th centuries the Slavs settled in most of the Balkans, including Strandzha. The whole territory of the modern park was included in the Bulgarian Empire for the first time in the aftermath of the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian war of 894‚Äì896. Strandzha remained a contested region between Bulgaria and Byzantium throughout the Middle Ages. In the 14th century, Bulgarian emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331‚Äì1371) gave refuge to the Hesychastic monk Gregory of Sinai and provided funds for the construction of a monastery near Paroria, in the homonymous protected area in the modern park, which attracted clerics from Bulgaria, Byzantium and Serbia. The interior of the region fell to the Ottoman Turks shortly after 1369 and the coastal towns were conquered in 1453. Under Ottoman rule, many villages provided auxiliaries to the Ottoman army or had to protect the mountain passes and therefore enjoyed a more favourable status ‚Äî they paid no taxes and the men had the right to bear arms. There were 17 privileged villages in the territory of the modern park where Muslims were not allowed to settle. During the time of internal disorder in the Ottoman Empire in 1785‚Äì1810, brigand bands wreaked havoc in Strandzha resulting in the migration of thousands of people. Another massive migration wave followed the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì29) and many Bulgarians settled in the southern areas of the Russian Empire. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Strandzha remained outside the borders of the reborn state. In July 1903 in the historic area Petrova Niva the delegates of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) discussed the outbreak of an anti-Ottoman rebellion. The Ilinden‚ÄìPreobrazhenie Uprising broke out in Strandzha and Macedonia in August 1903 and lasted for about twenty days before being suppressed by the Turks who committed great atrocities to the local population. Over 60 villages were burned down and thousands were massacred. An excerpt from the book \\"National Liberation and Libertarian Federalism\\", translated by Will Firth. Strandzha was liberated during the First Balkan War (1912‚Äì1913) and formally joined Bulgaria after the Second Balkan War in 1913. =Archaeological and architectural heritage= The rich history of Strandzha has left important vestiges across the territory of the park. The Thracians worshipped a Sun god as early as the Bronze Age and many of their rock sanctuaries and dolmens have been preserved in Strandzha. One of the main characteristics is the presence of megalith structures. Among the most important monuments of that epoch is the Thracian cult complex in Mishkova Niva, one the south-eastern slopes of Golyamo Gradishte peak from Malko Tarnovo. The complex, constructed in honour of a local chief and high priest, included a domed mound, a fortified edifice for the priests, a mould necropolis, a mine and a fortress. The domed mound has a diameter of , built by three rows and white marble blocks, and has been preserved up to a height of . The fortress is situated on Golyamo Gradishte peak, the highest point of the park; its diameter is 10 and the walls are thick. In the 5th‚Äì3rd century BC it was a dolmen and it was reconstructed as a monumental sanctuary in the 3rd‚Äì2nd century BC. The complex had a prominent place in the religious life of the Thracian tribes from all over the mountain. The Thracian necropolis of Propada, to the north-west of Malko Tarnovo, contains 40 burial mounds on a hill made of marble blocks. Coins discovered during the excavations prove the practice of Charon's obol. The ritual constitutes a coin being placed in or on the mouth of the dead person before burial as a payment for Charon, the ferryman who conveyed souls across the river that divided the world of the living from the world of the dead. The top of the hill is crowned by a small domed tomb with similar construction plan to those of the Thracian tombs of Kazanlak, Aleksandrovo, Mezek, etc. The necropolis was active until the 4th century AD. Another sanctuary of interest is situated in Kamenska Barchina, from Malko Tarnovo. It is located in an area of conglomerate rocks, which are relatively rare in Strandzha. There are many circles carved in the rock, associated with the sun cult and the preparation of sacred wine. There were around 60 Thracian fortresses in Strandzha, many of which were used in the Middle Ages when churches were constructed in their inner yards. The fortresses were built of large stones without the use of mortar. Vestiges of those stronghold can be found near the villages of Mladezhko, Balgari, Brodilovo, Malko Tarnovo, etc. The ruins of a fortress with church foundations are situated to the south-east of Zvezdets. There are ruins of several small early Byzantine castles along the coast between the rivers Veleka and Rezovska. These were part of the defensive system built by emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565) against Avar and Slavic incursions. On a small cape to the south of Ahtopol are the ruins of the Church of St Yani which used to be part of a larger monastic complex. The only preserved section of the edifice is the apse. During the Ottoman rule the area was isolated, which influenced the formation of a local style of rural architecture. The Strandzhan wooden houses evolved in the 17th and 18th centuries. They have a stone foundation and first floor and a wooden second storey. The walls, floors and ceilings are constructed from oak timber. The houses often follow an elongated plan ‚Äî all rooms are arranged one after another. An important architectural element is the fireplace, built in stone, up to wide in its foundations and deep. It narrows in height and takes the shape of a truncated pyramid. Examples of Strandzhan houses have been preserved in Malko Tarnovo, Brashlyan and Kosti. =Ethnography and folklore= Historically the region has been a centre of Bulgarian culture. Strandzha is inhabited by three ethnographic groups ‚Äî the Ruptsi, Tronki and Zagortsi. The Strandzhan or Eastern Ruptsi (called this way to distinguish them from the Rhodopean Ruptsi) are considered the largest of the three groups. The etymology of the name is linked to the word ropa or rupa, which means a \\"mine shaft\\" in the local dialects. They have preserved some vestiges of the pagan religious traditions and rites of the Antiquity. They speak the Strandzha dialect which is part of the Rup dialects and has preserved many words from the Old Bulgarian language. The traditional Ruptsi settlements in the park are Balgari, Brashlyan, Byala Voda, Gramatikovo, Kalovo, Kondolovo, Malko Tarnovo, Rezovo, Slivarovo, Stoilovo, Vizitsa, Zabernovo and Zvezdets. After 1913 the Ruptsi who inhabited the territory of modern Turkey settled in the north-western regions of Strandzha. Their main occupation was livestock breeding, and especially sheep breeding, logging, charcoal production and mining. The second largest group are the Tronki who inhabit mainly the areas to the north and to the west of the park in Sredets Municipality. They made a living mainly in agriculture but also in sheep and cattle breeding. The Zagortsi inhabit the regions to the north of the park and are thought to have migrated from north-eastern Bulgaria. The customs and rituals in Strandzha are related to specific days of the year, which in most cases coincide with the church holidays of the Christian calendar. They are traditionally divided into a summer (beginning on St George's Day, 6 May) and a winter period (beginning on St Demetrius' Day, 26 October). The largest festival in Strandzha is celebrated in mid-August in the historic area Petrova Niva in commemoration of the Ilinden‚ÄìPreobrazhenie Uprising. Nestinari in the village of Balgari The most characteristic tradition in Strandzha is Nestinarstvo, which involves a barefoot dance on smouldering embers performed by nestinari. The ritual was practised in several Bulgarian and Greek villages in the region and was first documented in 1862 by the Bulgarian poet Petko Slaveykov. Some historians theorise that Nestinarstvo dates back to Thracian times. The ritual is performed on the feast days of Saints Constantine and Helena on 3 and 4 June when a pilgrim procession consisting of all residents, led by nestinari carrying icons, heads to a holy spring near the village, where they consecrate the icons and dance horo. After sunset, the crowd makes a large fire about wide and 5 to thick and dances around it until the fire dies and only embers remain. The nestinari's barefoot dance on embers that follows as the climax of the night is accompanied by the beat of the sacred drum and the sound of a gaida (Bulgarian bagpipe). After the dance, the nestinari's feet do not show any trace of injury or burns. In the past the ritual was performed in the villages of Brodilovo, Gramatikovo, Kondolovo, Kosti and Slivarevo but nowadays Nestinarstvo is preserved in its authentic form only in the village of Balgari. Threats and conservation issues The coastline of the park near Sinemorets The main threat to the park comes from the uncontrolled tourist development which has plagued the Bulgarian Black Sea coast since the early 1990s. So far, the coast of the Strandzha Nature Park has remained almost intact. The most notable example is the case of the Golden Pearl hotel complex near the village of Varvara, whose construction commenced in 2006 on the territory of the part, supported by Tsarevo Municipality without ecological evaluation. After protests the construction was declared illegal later that year but the mayor of Tsarevo and the investor appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court of Bulgaria. In June 2007 the Court revoked the protected status of Strandzha Nature Park with order ‚Ññ 6794/29.06.2007. After mass protests the National Assembly adopted legislation prohibiting the right to appeal to court orders of the government establishing protected areas. In 2008 the Court declared the Golden Pearl hotel complex illegal and in 2012 the construction site was demolished. The issues regarding the development of the park's coastline remain open. The Master Plan of Tsarevo Municipality adopted in 2008 and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Water envisages the construction of vacation complexes with 75,000 beds on the territory of the park and Natura 2000 network. As a result, the European Commission launched an infringement procedure against Bulgaria that forced the Ministry to withdraw the positive environmental assessment of the Master Plan in 2010 but the decision was rejected by the Supreme Administrative Court. The Strandzha Nature Park Management Plan drafted in 2003 has not yet meet with approval by the Ministry of Environment and Water.

This temple has great religious importance in Hinduism and is dedicated to the Maa Durga. Durga Mandir was constructed in 18th century by Rani Bhabani of Natore. History Durga Mandir was constructed in 18th century by Bengali Maharani- Rani Bhabani of Natore. The temple is dedicated to the Goddess Durga. Next to the temple, is a kund (pond) which was earlier connected to the river Ganges. It is believed that the existing icon of the goddess was not made by a man but appeared on its own in the temple. In adhyaya (chapter) 23 of the Devi- Bhagavata Purana, this temple's origin is explained. As per the text, Kashi Naresh (king of Varanasi) called for a Swayamvar for his daughter Sashikala's marriage. The King later learnt that the princess was in love with vanvasi prince Sudarshan. So Kashi Naresh got his daughter secretly married to the prince. When the other Kings (who were invited for Swayamvar) got to know about the marriage, they got angry and went on war with Kashi Naresh. Sudarshan then offered prayers to Durga, who came on a lion and fought the war for Kashi Naresh and Sudarshan. After the war, Kashi Naresh pleaded to Durga to protect Varanasi and with that belief, this temple was constructed. Construction Durga Mandir was constructed in the 18th century (exact date of construction not known) by a Hindu Bengali Rani - Rani Bhabani of Natore. (Bengali queen). The temple was built in North Indian Nagara style of architecture. The temple is painted red with ochre to match the colours of the central icon of Durga, the goddess of strength and power. Inside the temple, many elaborately carved and engraved stones can be found. The temple is made up of many small sikharas conjoined together.

The double-span Burr Arch covered bridge structure was built by J. J. Daniels in 1880 and destroyed by arson on October 13, 1976. History =Construction= On March 10, 1880, the Parke County Commissioners advertised that they would be taking bids for a bridge to be built at Newcombs Ford in Florida Township. On May 14, 1880, the bids that had been turned in were opened. Richard Epperson had placed a bid for $8,700 and J. J. Daniels had placed two bids with different plans, plan #1 was for $7,600 and plan #2 was for $7,300. Daniels plan #1 won the contract. The Final inspection was completed on October 13, 1880. =Name= Early on, most covered bridges weren't painted, and when they were, they were usually painted white. This bridge was painted red and also had its ends painted red, most bridges had their ends painted white for improved visibility. Another benefit to painting the bridges may have been that it aided in the horses not being leery of entering them, thinking that the bridge was only a long barn rather than a bridge crossing over running water. =Destruction= Shortly after the bridge was damaged by arson in 1969 William Hargrave, former publisher of the Rockville Republican, established a fund, the Covered Bridge Arson Reward Fund, in an effort to discourage arsonist. However, seven years later, on October 13, 1976, 96 years to the day that it passed its final inspection, the Red Bridge was burnt down by arson. Three people were charged with second degree arson and conspiracy to commit a felony. All three were soon arrested separately. One was arrested by an Indiana State Police detective at a service station. Another was arrested at home by Parke County deputies. The last was picked up by West Terre Haute police near another service station. On October 15, 1976, they were arraigned before Judge Dowd with their cases being continued to October 29. Over the objections of the prosecutors the defense attorneys asked for and were granted continuances to study the charges and detailed information. They were later released on $50,000 bail each and the venue was moved to Vermillion County with Judge Peter J. Marietta presiding. Torch Newspapers would start a campaign to collect funds to rebuild the bridge but as of 2015 the Red Bridge has not been rebuilt or replaced. The stones in the three abutments may have been used on the new Bridgeton Covered Bridge and the road is closed.

The HWO also organizes Seminars, Awareness Camps, Information Campaigns, Demonstrations and Relief and Rehabilitation camps to promote a general culture of societal service and empathy and to challenge corruption and other agency issues in Public Institutions in the state through the use of RTI, 2009 and PSGA Acts. Awareness campaigns and efforts *The Hiamalyan Welfare Organization-HWO launched the Save Shahkul Campaign to help conserve and preserve the 50 km long Shahkul or Martand Canal which commands over 9,500 acres of land in June, 2016. The Campaign was launched at the one day national seminar organized by the HWO at Aishmuqam on the theme 'Environmental Conservation and Sustainable Development' on 4 June 2016 and attempts to rope in School Children as the main actors in environmental conservation by taking school students, sanitation workers and other concerned civil society members along to clean this canal and to go from door to door to urge and appeal to the people to stop using this canal as a drain and to build a general societal movement to stop dumping of household waste and garbage/sewage in the canal. *As part of its sanitation and clean environment drive to Save the Glaciers of the region, HWO volunteers recently collected garbage for proper disposal from Chandanwari following littering by pilgrims on the Amarnath Yatra in Chandanwari, following which the shrine board also took notice of the matter and initiated action. Mushtaq Pahalgami and the HWO have also been trying to bring media attention to the environmental damage caused to the valley due to the ongoing political unrest, seeking to expose the land mafia in regions as diverse as Pahalgam, Chandanwari and Sonamarg and government intervention to stop the timber, land and construction mafias from exploiting the region's natural resources by taking undue advantage of the situation, under the aegis of their project Green Himalayas. *The HWO organised a one day public discussion on Environmental conservation and the menace of poly-bags on 5 June 2017, emphasizing the need for source-segregation of waste and to make Pahalgam a polythene free city. HWO's booklet, tracing the organization's journey since its inception, was also launched at the event. The organization has also organized Social/Green-treks to promote the idea of voluntary garbage-recovery from ecologically sensitive glacier regions including dabyan and source-lake, Phalgam, where trekkers were sensitized about the need to conserve local environmenta nd were made to recover, collect and bring garbage back from the trek-destination. *The HWO observed the International Mountain Day on 11 December 2017 to create awareness and sensitization about the importance of mountain ecosystems and the need to conserve the same, by hosting a discussion on the subject for youngsters and concerned citizens at Townhall, Pahalagm. *HWO Organization had also approached the J&K; state high court seeking and leading to effective implementation of the 2006 court order banning use of polythene in the state. *HWO organised the first edition of the Himalayan Green Awards, 2018 at Townhall, Pahalagam on the 16th of April, 2018. The awards were presented in six categories including environmental service, education, community and social development and print and electronic media.

Valera was cleared for beatification in 2013 after a miracle that had found to have been attributed to her intercession was cleared. She was beatified on in 2014 by Cardinal Angelo Amato on behalf of Pope Francis. Biography Valera was born in 1893 in Spain to poor parents as the eldest of nine children. Her name of Maria Josefa was in honor of her grandmother. Her mother was a housewife while her father served as an agricultural worker. Valera studied as a child under female religious and it was from them she learnt how to do housework. Valera received communion at the age of 12 but she had received it at the age of 8 as she herself said to \\"steal\\" Jesus Christ. This occurred when the priest was absent and she went to the tabernacle to receive the consecrated host. Valera - at the age of 21 - became a member of the Congregation of the Daughters of Calvary in Villena. She established two of her own orders in 1930 and in 1951 for women and for men respectively.

In the 1950s she decided to begin a project that she believed represented the will of God: the construction of a sanctuary that would be dedicated to the love of God. On 22 November 1981, Pope John Paul II visited the sanctuary and visited Valera. In 1982, the pope recognized it as being a \\"minor basilica\\". She died in early 1983 and was buried in that church she worked hard to build. Beatification The cause of beatification commenced under Pope John Paul II on 9 March 1988 and the Positio - which documented her life of heroic virtue was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1993. The pope recognized that she had lived a life of heroic virtue and named her to be Venerable on 23 April 2002. An independent tribunal opened and closed in 2001 in response to a presumed miracle that had occurred. It submitted its findings to the congregation and Pope Francis approved the miracle on 5 July 2013. Cardinal Angelo Amato - on behalf of the pope - celebrated the beatification on 31 May 2014.

Construction  The old North Arm Powder Magazine at Magazine Creek south of the North Arm of the Port River, Port Adelaide The ten magazines of the Dry Creek explosives depot were built in 1906 at the expenditure of ¬£6,000 or ¬£7,000 at Broad Creek, a tidal distributary channel on the eastern side of the Barker Inlet of the Port River Estuary, which runs in the direction of the suburb of Dry Creek. The Broad Creek site, located on the landward side of intertidal mangroves and supratidal saltmarshes, was chosen as a more isolated location from Port Adelaide, replacing an earlier explosives depot called North Arm Powder Magazine at Magazine Creek at Gillman, south of the North Arm of the Port River.  Horse tram  Horse-drawn explosives carrying wagons in the Dry Creek explosives depot in South Australia A narrow gauge tramway with a track gauge of was constructed in 1906. It ran along the magazines and connected the depot via a length of 2 km (1¬º miles) to the landing jetty and on the other side via 800 m (¬Ω mile) to the Dry Creek railway station. Six bespoke wagons were used for the transport of explosives such as dynamite to the magazines - each held 1¬º tons. The wagons were drawn by horses. Previously, explosives had to be transported by road from the North Arm to the magazines, and this both dangerous and expensive.The Dry Creek Explosives Depot. An official visit. The Advertiser, 20 June 1906. The wagons were donated in 1978 to the Illawarra Light Railway Museum, where they are now exhibited.  Inspection  The president of the Marine Board, Arthur Searcy, and four wardens officially inspected the Dry Creek explosives depot on Tuesday, 19 June 1906. They were conveyed to the Broad Creek jetty in the motor launch Warden. The party travelled on one of the horse-drawn wagons to the magazines, which were found in perfect order. Each magazine was capable of storing 40 tons of explosives, but 20 tons were at that time fixed as the maximum quantity to be stored in them. Every precaution was taken to guard against explosion, and printed regulations were exhibited on each of the magazine doors. Mounds had been built between each magazine, so that should one of the magazines explode no injury would result to the others. The party was quite satisfied that the system for the handling and storage of explosives was superior in every respect to the one formerly in use. The magazine reserve, which consisted of about 307 acres, was being improved, by the planting of tamarisk and other trees to provide shadow and explosion breaks.  Operation  Premises of the powder magazine office at Dry Creek Limewash was normally applied to magazines' exterior walls. Care was taken to minimise and isolate the explosives from damp, heat and grit. The magazine structures incorporated insulated walls and were designed to create a naturally and reasonably cooled and ventilated environment. Their ventilation shafts were covered by metal ventilation louvers, coupled with spark arrestors and dust deflectors. The king tides regularly flooded the estuarine plain. Consequently, the tramline along the mangroves from the magazines to the jetty at Broad Creek was frequently damaged. In July, 1917, the jetty was inundated by the highest tide on record up to that date, 3.6 m above low water, and was washed away. The following August an unusually high tide washed away the gear of the levee workmen, including planks, barrels, barricades and bags of silt, which disappeared without a trace.  Decline  By 1925 explosives were delivered from Deer Park, Victoria less frequently but in larger batches. Therefore, less explosives were delivered via the jetty, the number of daily paid stevedores declined and the turnover was reduced. Jetty at Broad CreekBridget Jolly: A Significant Site: the Former Dry Creek Explosives Reserve. In: Journal of the Historical Society of South Australia, No. 29, 2001, pp. 70-84. By 1934, shipworm and lack of preventive maintenance had materially weakened the wooden structures. From 1934 explosives were railed from Victoria directly to the Dry Creek explosives depot. By 1947 all explosives were delivered this way. In 1950 urgent safety relevant repairs were ordered, but were not conducted until September 1952. Decreasing revenue from the port trade led to lessened maintenance and dredging of the Broad Creek landing. The jetty was last used in February 1970 and demolished about 1976. As waterborne trade decreased, land transport of explosives was coupled to technological progress in the explosive usage. From early 1978 ammonium nitrate came into fashion as an ingredient of explosives mixtures that could be prepared on-site. This resulted in further safety refinements, and diffusion of responsibility for explosive storage. This eliminated much of the previously needed inspection, sampling and storage.  Closure  The operation of the site ceased in October 1995. Eleven of the historic buildings at Dry Creek, which were built from 1903 to 1907, are still in place and were listed on the South Australian Heritage Register on 15 December 1994 as No. 14521. Their condition was generally sound as of the year 2000, but the reinforcement bars of hollow concrete piles, which were installed instead of jarrah piles in the 1960s, are so corroded by the saline soil that the long term stability is under threat.Chapter 15: Public Service Facilities.

Life Ollaik was born in Khiam in southern Lebanon to a family with a heritage in beekeeping. At the age of 13, Ollaik was recruited into Hezbollah and later on became the party's student representative at AUB. Between 1992 and 1996, Ollaik played a crucial role in Hezbollah's growing and controversial influence in AUB, and led the 10 October student protest of 1994. Ollaik resigned from the party's ranks in 1996. In 2008, Ollaik published his autobiography, \\"The Bees Road\\", which recounts his experience with Hezbollah. The book was rewritten in English and a French adaptive translation \\"La Route des Abeilles\\" was released by Editions Anne Carriere in Paris. A sequel to The Bees Road, \\"Under the Green Waters\\", was published in Arabic on November 21, 2012 and a second sequel is currently underway ‚Äì the final version of the trilogy. Ollaik published Your Guide to Beekeeping - Arabic in 2010, co-written with his father Salman Ollaik. In 2009, Ollaik founded Lebanon Ahead, a movement aimed at improving the country and changing it into a peaceful and democratic nation by creating a platform of communication and understanding among citizens. Through it, he founded a coalition of independent democratic civic forces ‚ÄúTakaddom‚Äù and ran with two other candidates on Lebanon Ahead's ticket in the general parliamentary elections. Ollaik also launched a national protest movement for political reform in 2013, ‚Äú10 October Revolution‚Äù, which focused on the need to abolish the Lebanese sectarian political system through amending the prevailing sectarian structure of the Lebanese state since Independence. The revolution calls for the establishment of a sovereign nation for all Lebanese, where all citizens are equal under the law and where corruption is curbed, and for restoring the voting power of the people through a just, modern, non-sectarian electoral law. Education Ollaik pursued a BS in agriculture and diploma in agricultural engineering and an MS in agricultural economics at AUB, and a PhD in food and resource economics at the University of Florida. He also obtained a License degree in Law from the Lebanese University and became an attorney at law at the Beirut Bar Association. Books *The Bees Road (English and Arabic) The Bees Road In an inspirational journey that takes the reader from war-torn South Lebanon to a detention cell at JFK airport, The Bees Road is the personal narrative of Rami Ollaik. A Lebanese Shiite raised in an environment full of violence and cruelty, Rami joins and rises to the top echelons of Hezbollah. After 13 years of party involvement, he reevaluates his life and his conception of love in an attempt to rid himself of his haunting fundamentalist past and to finally pursue his ultimate goal of personal freedom. A rough path that leaves him a traitor to Hezbollah, a suspected terrorist to the United States, a professor of beekeeping in Beirut, and author of The Bees Road. The Bees Road follows the true life of Rami Ollaik starting with his childhood in Southern Lebanon at the brink of the Lebanese Civil War. This ravaged landscape proves inescapable, and, like many Southern Lebanese Shiites, Rami is drawn to Hezbollah's resistance movement and indoctrinated into a path of fundamentalist Islam. Distinguishing himself in the Party of God, Rami builds friendships and connections with some of Hezbollah's most prominent figures. However, as he moves to Lebanon's capital to attend the American University of Beirut and head Hezbollah's AUB recruitment operations, pivotal events on campus and key interactions with the student body cause him to question his values, his views on women, and even the Party itself. After clashing with Hezbollah's leadership, Rami leaves the Party of God to pursue a life of open-mindedness and freedom. This personal reform proves difficult, involving humiliating romantic interactions and a troubling suicide attempt, but eventually the path of the new Rami takes him all the way to the United States to pursue his education. In the land of ‚ÄúThe Great Satan,‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt take long for Rami to fall in love with everything that America stands for. Unfortunately, the fateful events of September 11 and the resulting national paranoia and Islamophobia push Rami into confrontations with the FBI, blackmail, and interrogation. After an unexpected and unwarranted deportation from the US, Rami's assistant-ship is canceled and he's forced to continue his PhD studies through distance correspondence. The story ends with Rami back in his home country teaching beekeeping at AUB, filled with the urge to build a stronger Lebanon and unite the nation as whole. A French version of the book, La route des abeilles, was released in France by √âditions Anne Carriere. - *Under The Green Waters (Arabic) Under the Green Waters A war-shocked child brought under the wing of Hezbollah. That child's growth into a man, and his subsequent Intifadas. A traitor to Hezbollah, a suspected terrorist to the United States, a professor of beekeeping and author of The Bees Road. Where is Rami Ollaik? Where has his unlikely path taken him? And, perhaps most importantly, who has been watching him? Under The Green Waters is the continuation of the story laid down in The Bees Road: a story of the publication's fallout, its blow on the author and impact on Lebanese politics, and a story of meticulous sabotage. In the theo- political war of ideology, words carry weight and the author's words published in The Bees Road prove to be heavy. How did the Party of God react to his blasphemies? Who was listening to his message, and where did their allegiances finally lie? In a novel of intimidation, backstabbing and dangerous politics, Under The Green Waters takes us even deeper into the murky circles of the corrupt Lebanese State. Tracing the life of Rami Ollaik, from the publication of The Bees Road to Lebanon Ahead's brief and foiled attempts to create a unifying bridge in the Lebanese political scene, the author creatively illustrates the aftermath of his first novel and exposes the impact, both on society and personal life, that one book can have. Under The Green Waters is a work of nonfiction, a literary autobiographical account of the author's story from its writing to its release in 2008 and the aftermath. The story, following the popularity of his first book in Lebanon, traces his formation of the idealistic post-partisan unity movement Lebanon Ahead. The story follows the release of his unprecedented publication where he shows the behind-the- scenes nature of democracy in the Middle East, the intricately calibrated intimidation campaigns, and the problematic practices of US-Mid East relations. While these themes remain poignant, it is also a story of love, betrayal, fear, hope, and devastating heartbreak.

In an inspirational journey that takes the reader from war-torn South Lebanon to a detention cell at JFK airport, The Bees Road is the personal narrative of Rami Ollaik. A Lebanese Shiite raised in an environment full of violence and cruelty, Rami joins and rises to the top echelons of Hezbollah. In 1994, and after 13 years of party involvement, he reevaluates his life and his conception of love in an attempt to rid himself of his haunting fundamentalist past and to finally pursue his ultimate goal of personal freedom.

A Lebanese Shiite raised in an environment full of violence and cruelty, Rami joins and rises to the top echelons of Hezbollah. After 13 years of party involvement, he reevaluates his life and his conception of love in an attempt to rid himself of his haunting fundamentalist past and to finally pursue his ultimate goal of personal freedom. A rough path that leaves him a traitor to Hezbollah, a suspected terrorist to the United States, a professor of beekeeping in Beirut, and author of The Bees Road. The Bees Road follows the true life of Rami Ollaik starting with his childhood in Southern Lebanon at the brink of the Lebanese Civil War. This ravaged landscape proves inescapable, and, like many Southern Lebanese Shiites, Rami is drawn to Hezbollah's resistance movement and indoctrinated into a path of fundamentalist Islam. Distinguishing himself in the Party of God, Rami builds friendships and connections with some of Hezbollah's most prominent figures. However, as he moves to Lebanon's capital to attend the American University of Beirut and head Hezbollah's AUB recruitment operations, pivotal events on campus and key interactions with the student body cause him to question his values, his views on women, and even the Party itself. After clashing with Hezbollah's leadership, Rami leaves the Party of God to pursue a life of open- mindedness and freedom. This personal reform proves difficult, involving humiliating romantic interactions and a troubling suicide attempt, but eventually the path of the new Rami takes him all the way to the United States to pursue his education. In the land of ‚ÄúThe Great Satan,‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt take long for Rami to fall in love with everything that America stands for. Unfortunately, the fateful events of September 11 and the resulting national paranoia and Islamophobia push Rami into confrontations with the FBI, blackmail, and interrogation. After an unexpected and unwarranted deportation from the US, Rami's assistant-ship is canceled and he's forced to continue his PhD studies through distance correspondence. The story ends with Rami back in his home country teaching beekeeping at AUB, filled with the urge to build a stronger Lebanon and unite the nation as whole.

The book follows a forthright approach in outlining the fundamentals of the life of the honeybee and illustrates both the individual and social aspects of one of nature's most fascinating creatures, starting with species and race evolution, genetics, anatomy and physiology, and ending with the bee's social behavior as a member of a colony. It also depicts the delicate ecological interaction of the honeybee with its surrounding flora and fauna, especially in light of the worldwide alarming Colony collapse disorder (CCD) phenomenon. It helps both beekeepers and amateurs utilize the presented knowledge in the collection of as much potential products and services from the colony as possible. . Lebanon Ahead ahead *The Way Out Lebanon Ahead is a collaborated human effort aiming at making Lebanon a better place where citizens can live with dignity and freedom. Lebanon Ahead's objective is reviving the nation, the \\"we feeling\\", and the sense of responsibility by building the country economically, socially and politically. *The Focus Lebanon Ahead's focus is the Lebanese educated and vibrant youth who are capable of restructuring the civic society. Beekeeping Bee Keeping Since his early childhood, Rami Ollaik was introduced to beekeeping through his father. He joined the American University in Beirut (AUB) to study agriculture, the field closest to beekeeping at the time. His first scientific approach to the bee world was his MS thesis dealing with economic and marketing modeling of apiculture in Lebanon. Afterwards in 1998, he started conducting applied research on local honeybees, as well as imported strains, in order to assess their productivity and adaptivity to local production conditions and thus arrive at a superior stock. While pursuing his doctorate studies at the University of Florida, Ollaik expanded his expertise and exposure to the international practices related to bees and beekeeping. Rami's passion for bees led him to carry on his father's work of developing the beekeeping industry all over Lebanon through teaching, research and extension services at AUB. Ollaik was the first to introduce beekeeping into the curriculum of AUB's Faculty of Agriculture & Food Sciences, designed Lebanon's first beekeepers calendar, improved local beekeeping cultural practices along modern scientific lines, focused on integrated pest management systems and added scientific guidelines to honey production and marketing. He organized at AUB the first and second national scientific conferences for the improvement and modernization of beekeeping practices. He also worked on the development of beekeeping practices in the Arab region and participated in many international conferences. His publications about beekeeping, including the book \\"Your guide to beekeeping\\" - Arabic, were considered the first scientific releases about apiculture in Lebanon.

It is defined as systematically assessing scientific information from published, peer-reviewed publications and texts, practitioners' experiences, independent expert assessment, and local and indigenous knowledge on a specific conservation topic. This includes assessing the current effectiveness of different management interventions, threats and emerging problems and economic factors. Evidence-based conservation was organized based on the observations that decision making in conservation was based on intuition and/ or practitioner experience often disregarding other forms of evidence of successes and failures (e.g. scientific information). This has led to costly and poor outcomes. Evidence- based conservation provides access to information that will support decision making through an evidence-based framework of ‚Äúwhat works‚Äù in conservation The evidence-based approach to conservation is based on evidence-based practice which started in medicine and later spread to nursing, education, psychology and other fields. It is part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices. Systematic review A systematic review consists of a non- subjective assessment of available data and evidence related to management. Synthesizing results from different studies over different time periods, locations or sample sizes can reduce the bias present in individual studies. Systematic reviews differ from traditional reviews by being easily understood, peer-reviewed and repeatable. Detailed protocols remain available for conducting a thorough, unbiased systematic review. In a Cochrane systematic review, there is little evidence that environmental conservation, and enhancement activities can have any effect on adults' well-being and health. However, there is a high level of perceived benefits based on the feedback of the participants. Synopsis Part of implementing an evidence-based conservation analysis requires generating a synopsis. This refers to the brief description of a single study or a systematic review. Synopses form the building blocks of summaries when collated across specific themes. Summary A summary is broader than a synopsis and refers to the standardized description of results extracted from several studies or systematic reviews on a particular topic. Summaries are regularly updated as more information becomes available and are ideally generated through a rigorous review process. History Evidence-based conservation is inspired by evidence-based medicine. Evidence-based conservation was first noted in the literature in 2000.Sutherland, W.J. 2000. The conservation handbook: research, management and policy. Oxford: Blackwell ScientificPullin, A. S. and Knight, T. M. 2001. Effectiveness in Conservation Practice: Pointers from Medicine and Public Health. Conservation Biology, 15: 50‚Äì54 Over the last decade, the methodology for generating systematic reviews (e.g. protocols, systematic maps) have been improved and standardized. In addition, several collaborative networks have been formed and two journals have been launched. The Collaboration for Environmental Evidence has a journal titled Environmental Evidence dedicated to the publication of systematic reviews, review protocols and systematic maps on impacts of human activity and the effectiveness of management interventions. It currently has centres located in Australia, Sweden, South Africa, Canada, France and the UK. The Conservation Evidence group has a journal titled Conservation Evidence that was launched in 2004 to document the effectiveness of conservation interventions. Conservation Evidence is a web- based database repository that systematizes and provides access to conservation efforts, programs, and research on the biodiversity and the environment based on high quality, reviewed publications. Critique Since evidence-based conservation is based on the primary data on interventions, it is as good as the available data. Even when data are available, some authors have noted that evidence-based conservation may not be routinely used in decision making for management and conservation policy.Pullin, A. S., and T. M. Knight. 2005. Assessing conservation management‚Äôs evidence base: a survey of management-plan compilers in the United Kingdom and Australia. Conservation Biology 19:1989‚Äì1996Cook, C. N., et al., 2010. Conservation in the dark? The information used to support management decisions. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 8:181‚Äì186. Often there may be a disconnect between the science that is produced and the management interventions taken. Three reasons have been suggested for this in the literature: # the scope of the scientific questions may not cover adequately the management requirements (this translates to lack of ‚Äúactionable evidence‚Äù for management), # the scientific research produced covers the management needs, yet the recommendations from the evidence may not be feasible for implementation due to practical constraints (time, financial budgets etc.) or # the conservation practitioners do not have access to the evidence. Often peer reviewed journal articles produced by scientists are not freely available (open access) or use complicated jargon that managers may not always comprehend. In a survey in eastern England, it was found that park managers get only 2.4% of their information from primary scientific literature. These areas need further attention in the future. Evidence-based conservation has also been criticised in the past for ignoring traditional forms of knowledge and experience.Adams, W. M. & Sandbrook, C. (2013) Conservation, Evidence and Policy. Oryx, 47(3), 329-335 However, the steps of evidence-based conservation can be designed to take traditional forms of knowledge also into consideration.

He specialized in the news and current events of the Pacific Islands and Papua New Guinea for more than sixty years. Stuart Inder was born on 7 November 1926. He joined the Australian military as a journalist in Japan and Korea during the late 1940s. Inder began his career as a reporter for ABC News, based in Port Moresby, Territory of Papua and New Guinea, during the early 1950s. Later during the 1950s, he joined the staff of Pacific Publications, the owner and publisher of both the Fiji Times and the Pacific Islands Monthly (PIM), a publication which had been founded by Robert William \\"Robbie\\" Robson in August 1930. PIM became popular with universities worldwide for their Pacific Island studies collections, as well as businesspeople and farmers in the region. Inder and his colleague, Judy Tudor, served as the co-editors of Pacific Islands Monthly (PIM) from November 1957 until November 1964. He then became the only editor of PIM from November 1964 until October 1975. PIM increased in popularity, leading to more letters and guests at the newsroom in Sydney than the staff could keep up with. In response, Inder and Robson instituted a policy allowing visitors only on Thursday. Robson later sold the Fiji Times and the Pacific Islands Monthly Herald and Weekly Times Group. Following the sale, Inder remained as PIM's editor until October 1975, when he was succeeded as editor by Angus Smales, a longtime journalist for the Herald and Weekly Times Papua New Guinea. Inder then served as PIM's publisher from October 1975 to August 1980. During this time, Inder also took over the role of editor for PIM's Pacific Islands Year Book from Judy Tudor during this time. Pacific Islands Monthly ended its publications in June 2000 after nearly seven decades. Despite PIM's closure, Inder continued to hold his monthly Pacific Islands Monthly Lunch, which he started during the mid-1960s. The lunches meet on the first Friday of each month at the Law Society restaurant in Phillip Street, Sydney. Notable guests of Inder's Pacific Islands Monthly Lunch include former Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea Michael Somare, the first President of Nauru Hammer DeRoburt, and former President of Fiji Kamisese Mara. The Pacific Islands Monthly Lunch remains one of Sydney's longest running professional lunch series, as of 2015. Inder became a Pacific affairs writer for The Bulletin following his departure from PIM. Dick Smith, an Australian entrepreneur and founder of Australian Geographic, hired Inder as the editor of many of his magazines, books and other publications, including Australian Geographic. Inder also worked as a guest lecturer on the Pacific Islands for cruise lines, businesses and other organizations. In one instance, Inder became ill which lecturing on a cruise ship anchored off Rarotonga, Cook Islands. The then Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, Tom Davis, sailed out to the ship to visit Inder. Inder edited Tales of Papua New Guinea, which was published by Papua New Guinea Association of Australia in 2001. Stuart Inder, a resident of Wahroonga and former resident of Turramurra, died on 30 January 2015, at the age of 88. He was survived by his wife, Jo, and their children, Lesley, David and Stephanie. His funeral was held at the North Chapel of the Northern Suburbs Crematorium, Sydney, on 9 February 2015.

Synopsis The events of the novel take place over the course of one day, set against a background of post-9/11 tension between Christian and Muslim identities in New York. The novel begins with the murder of Paul Feiler, an academic specialist in Abrahamic theology who works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, by Charles Hogue, a CIA agent, shortly before Feiler is due to give a revelatory lecture at an academic conference in New York. Just before being apprehended by Hogue, Feiler writes a cryptic message, prominently including a verse from the Prophecies of Nostradamus, to his colleague James Donnelly, an Irish academic who is also at the conference; the message is delivered to Donnelly just after Feiler's murder. The novel focuses on Donnelly wringing a convoluted series of clues from Feiler's message: these lead him to discover that Feiler had got hold of the legendary Book of Abraham, supposedly acquired by the CIA shortly after its discovery among the Dead Sea Scrolls, and supposedly providing unusually early and authoritative evidence that the Binding of Isaac was actually, as held in many Islamic traditions, a binding of Ishmael. To some characters in the novel, this is seen to challenge Christian narratives of supremacy among the Abrahamic faiths and so American national security. Since the message is written on a postcard of the Metropolitan museum, Donnelly and Swift proceed to Feiler's office there. They are followed by the detectives investigating Feiler's death, Fat√≠ma Parker and John Russell. Parker and Russell confront Donnelly and Swift in Feiler's office. Donnelly convinces Parker and Russell that he was not involved in Feiler's murder; that the CIA might have been; and that they need to work together to unravel Feiler's clues. Meanwhile, Parker and Russell's boss Tom Fraser contacts Charles Hogue's boss Ben Rottenberg to tell him about the postcard; and Rottenberg sends another CIA agent, Jack Kerver, to the Metropolitan. When Kerver arrives in Feiler's office, Donnelly hides, and Parker and Russell allow Kerver to think that Swift is in fact Donnelly. Kerver apprehends Swift and leaves. Donnelly, Parker and Russell proceed to Columbia University, where Donnelly hopes to find assistance and refuge from another academic friend of Feiler's, Richard Ruskin. They discover, however, that he died in a car accident that morning and infer (correctly) that he was murdered by the same person who murdered Feiler. They proceed to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine seeking a quiet place to work on Feiler's clues and, when they realise that they are about to be found by the police, to the Morgan Library & Museum, where they expect to find the book. Meanwhile, the novel occasionally interweaves the activities of John A. Franklin, an Arab-American agent provocateur in Palestine. Back in New York, Hogue requests the book, which is held at an institution called Strategic Business Alliance Inc., with the intention of destroying it; but he finds it missing and realises that Feiler has stolen and hidden it. He returns to the CIA office at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research to participate in the interrogation of Swift. A mysterious, high-ranking government official called Richard Hourani, on hearing of his old friend Feiler's death, flies from Washington to New York. Discovering that Swift has been apprehended, Hourani uses his influence to meet Swift, and engineers his escape from the CIA, apparently by knocking Hogue unconscious. Hourani and Swift meet Donnelly, Parker, and Russell at the Morgan library, swiftly followed by Hogue. It transpires that Hogue, Russell, and Hourani are all members of the Project for the New American Century and it is Hourani, and not Hogue's CIA boss Rottenberg, who was behind the murder of Feiler; these three hold Donnelly, Swift and Parker at gunpoint. It turns out the book is not at the Morgan Library but rather than Feiler had left it with his neighbour Mar√≠a Morgan so the whole group proceeds there where they indeed find the book. Donnelly buys time by accusing Hourani of orchestrating the September 11 attacks as a false flag operation to justify the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and of planning another similar attack in Paris. To his own surprise, he turns out to be correct. Russell concludes that Hourani's position is immoral. Fraser hears about the disturbance at Morgan's flat and tips off Rottenberg and Kerver, who have already realised the connection of Hourani, Hogue, and Russell to the New American Century. Together, Rottenberg, Kerver, and Russell kill Hogue and apprehend Hourani, foiling Franklin's terrorist plot in Paris. The novel ends with Donnelly starting a relationship with Parker.

Though not always the case, discrimination in Ghana is often based on preconceived, usually unfavorable, judgments toward people or a person because of their religion, tribe, language or personal characteristics including but not limited to gender, political opinion, social class, age, disability and sexual orientation. In 2013, Ghana placed below average on the Failed state index scoring 4.9/10.0 when measured against the variables of Tolerance and Inclusion, and Discrimination and violence against minorities. Types of discrimination in Ghana =Age= =Disability= Discrimination in Ghana is widespread against the disabled. Few educational institutions accept disabled students or make provision for such students including those with mild cases, for example students who cannot climb stairs. Government building and worship centers are mostly built also lacking that same capability. Adults with mental illness may be put in prayer camps. In some communities infants who show signs of deformity are put to death for fear of infecting everyone else in their family with a perceived bad luck. =Education institutions= The Lord's Prayer is compulsory to students in all basic schools and in most senior high schools in the country. Besides the Lord's Prayer, Morning devotion, the widely practiced Christian ritual of praying before class starts in the morning is now been contested by Muslim parents and students. =Employment and workplace= Muslim women are banned from wearing a headscarf to work not only in private spaces but also in government offices. In March 2015, nurses at Mamobi Polyclinic in Accra were asked to go home and not return as punishment for putting on some form of head covering. =Ethnicity and tribe= *Collins Dauda *Dzifa Ativor *Fiifi Fiavi Kwetey *Yaw Osafo-Marfo =Language= =Religion= Chapter 5 of the Constitution of Ghana protects freedom and practice of religion. 2013 Report on International Religious Freedom published by the United States Department of State concludes that Government of Ghana generally respects all religious groups and has shown commitment to this by demonstrating leadership style when skirmishes do arise. It however confirmed among other cases accounts of instructors at some public schools openly discriminating against students based on their Islamic faith. Following statements made by Bishop Charles Agyin-Asare at a Sunrise service in 2015 that there was \\"a religious cleansing campaign aimed at exterminating all Christians from the face of the earth and that \\"the world's 1.2 billion Muslim population were targeting Christians to harm them for being Christians\\", various calls have been made by the government and stakeholders for religious leaders to moderate their speech and avoid cultivating fertile ground that can yield tension between the two faiths in Ghana. Agyen Asare at the service stated that \\"We won't keep quiet anymore, some people believe that they should kill others so that they are the only people who can worship their 'whoever'\\". He further stated that \\"It's unfortunate; and we are going to do something about it\\". The Chief Imam has consistently dismissed claims of an existing Muslim-Christian tensions in the country stating that \\"we are living in harmony and would continue to do so\\". In a 2015 press release, he reiterated the need for Muslims and Christians to engage in dialogue to resolve problems. =Sex and gender= =Sexual orientation= Legislation See also *Discrimination References Category:Racism in Africa Category:Human rights abuses in Ghana Category:Ghanaian society Category:Prejudice and discrimination ","title":"Discrimination in Ghana"},{"id":"45543012","title":"Wales at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games"},{"id":"45543019","text":"Julie Helene (Ella) Taube af Karl√∂ (1860‚Äì1930), was a Swedish (originally Baltic-German) noble and courtier.

Viscount Grant, also known as Gable was an Afghan Hound who was the winner of the title of Best In Show at the Crufts dog show in 1987. Early life Gable, known by his kennel name Viscount Grant, was owned by Chris Amoo, of the British band The Real Thing, and his wife Julie. They bred the dog themselves, after getting involved with the breed as Chris Amoo's record producer owned two Afghans. Gable was the third Afghan Hound to be owned by the couple, and Chris Amoo said that \\"I could tell when he was three weeks old that he was a champion\\". Show career Gable was entered in his first dog show at the age of six months, and placed fourth overall. By his fourth show, Amoo said that Gable had hit his stride and victories started to come, winning 21 first prizes in a row at one point. The dog was entered into Crufts in 1986, and was named Best Puppy in the show. The 1988 Crufts show was the second time that Gable had been entered in the UK national, and was no longer eligible for the puppy classes. Amoo had previous experience with showing at this level, as he also owned an Afghan named Hamilton which had been named Best of Breed at the show twice. It was victorious once more, first winning Best of Breed, then the Hound Group and finally Best In Show. Due to his victory, Gable won ¬£175 for his owners as well as two trophies, which would need to be handed back prior to the following year's competition. He was also given a limited edition plate with his picture on it, and a sponsorship deal with the dog food Pedigree chum, with single payment of ¬£350. As part of that deal, the dog food manufacturers also gave the owners a painting of Gable valued at ¬£2,000. Following Crufts Following his victory, Amoo described Gable as being \\"basically retired\\", but was concerned that the dog might become bored without dog shows to compete at. He felt that while he might take Gable along to a few shows, he wouldn't take him back to Crufts as failing to be Best in Show once again would be an anticlimax. After Crufts, Gable was recognised from both his appearances on television as well as the ongoing advertisements for Pedigree Chum. Concerned that the attention was making him jumpy and nervous, his owners began to walk him less and they noticed that he was growing more insular over time. A number of offers were made to purchase the dog, but the owners turned these down as they considered Gable to be one of the family.

Painting Domenico Ghirlandaio was an Italian Renaissance painter who was active in Florence. He was a representative of the Florentine Renaissance, along with Verrocchio, the Pollaiolo brothers and Sandro Botticelli. The painting is an early work of the painter, probably painted at the same time when he painted the frescos in the Collegiate Church of San Gimignano. Ghirlandaio was noted for capturing the facial expression of his sitters in a remarkable way, rendering them with animated expressions. The painting was cleaned and renovated, revealing the bright green background underneath a layer of oxidised pigment. The identity of the man depicted in the painting is unknown. In 15th-century Italy, the stylistic development of individual portrait-painting had awoken with new vigor after a thousand years of silence. The last period in the history was in the antiquity, when the Romans were known for their prolific depiction of individual traits of peoples. After the Romans this was mostly reserved for rulers and notable members of the aristocracy and historic figures. The new kind of depictions from the Renaissance were based on the emerging sense of individuality, the visual sense of self-understanding; a new kind of self- presentation that in our modern era is taken for granted. The painting remained in Italy until 1829, when it was acquired by the K√∂nigliche Museen zu Berlin (later the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, now part of the Berlin State Museums). Originally attributed to Ghirlandaio, it was re-attributed to his brother-in-law and artistic follower Sebastiano Mainardi and sold in 1924. After passing through the hands of several dealers, it was acquired in New York by art collector Michael Friedsam who bequeathed it to the Metropolitan Museum of Arts in 1931.

Biography From early childhood, Kapchuk took an interest in art and at the age of six, Natalia began to make ceramic mini-sculptures for sale at local art fairs in Yekaterinburg. She was inspired to work in art studios by her mother, an artist, and sculptor. She gradually learned the basics of sculpting in ceramic. Children‚Äôs art school became the next stage in her young artist‚Äôs career, where she studied academic drawing, painting, composition and the history of art. Kapchuk received her B.A. from the Urals State University where she studied at the Faculty of International Relations (Yekaterinburg, Russia). She left Russia in 2007, seeking to apply her talents and creative abilities, eventually turning her attention to the art business and creating artworks in her own studio in Dubai, UAE. Natalia Kapchuk also continued to improve her art skills in mixed media and painting. In 2017, She studied mixed media and painting at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design (London, UK) and then at the Chelsea College of Arts (London, UK). Preferring to work in mixed media, Natalia started combining the technique of collage with painting. Her \\"Political leaders\\" series of works explores global trends in economics and politics, representing silhouettes of presidents and heads of state on their national flags. By featuring symbols such as guns, rifles, the Star of David, an upside-down statue of Liberty, the peace sign or Victory hand emoji, the artist reveals associative chains of contemporary society and highlights a tone of political rhetoric in the mass media.

In 1861, the church opened St Jude‚Äôs Schools, also on Hill Street. A restoration project was undertaken in 1879.

Organ The church was equipped with a pipe organ by Edward James Bossward dating from 1867. It was opened on 19 May 1867 and had 13 stops. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

It was released in 2011. The album compiles three sessions as well as a live performance. 29 of the 34 songs on the album had not been previously released, officially. Background The tapes that the album were remastered from were discovered by Ian MacKaye as he was organizing Dischord's collection. The first 20 tracks were recorded in November 1981 at Hit and Run Studios in Rockville, Maryland and were used by the band as a demo tape. Tracks 21-30 were recorded at Inner Ear Studios in December 1981; tracks 21, 22, and 23 would be used in the Flex Your Head label album. 31 & 32 two were recorded in June 1982 during the recordings for the Faith/Void split album, again at Inner Ear studios. The final two tracks are live recordings of the band during the end stages of their existence in late 1983. Reception The album did not receive much attention, but the reviews that it did receive were very positive. MetalSucks reviewer Mike Gitter declared it the reissue of the year, remarking that it was \\"[t]he sound of music being played with such fury that it falls apart only to put itself back together on the next song some 30 seconds later.\\" Meanwhile, Pitchfork's review was also quite positive, but somewhat more subdued; feeling that the recordings were not as good as those from their split and that the release removed some of the band's mystery.

The cassette was limited to 200 hand-numbered copies.[authoritative source needed] The demo was self-produced by Ulver, and recorded in the Norwegian trollforest, between October 15 and 17, 1993. Their music and style was consistent with the early Norwegian black metal subculture during the early 1990s. However some have noted the avant-garde, jazz, rock and gothic influences that would later shape the band's sound. The archaic Dano-Norwegian lyrics were greatly influenced by Scandinavian folktales and inspired by Baroque poets such as Ludvig Holberg and the hymn-writer Thomas Kingo. Cover art contains a 19th-century engraving of werewolf from Mansell Collection in London. According to Avantgarde Metal: ‚ÄúVargnatt is the primeval quintessance of Ulver's Trilogie; the satanic energy, haunting yet calm beauty and romantic melancholy of the mighty Norwegian Forests, and those who dwell there in. An inspiring soundtrack for a solemn and hateful stroll through the woods at dusk.‚Äù In 2003 the demo was significantly remastered, and reissued through Infinite Vinyl in 10-inch white vinyl format, and limited to 1000 hand-numbered copies. The release included additional photos and artwork as well as sleeve notes from Chris Bruni. The demo was later included in Ulver‚Äôs Trolsk Sortmetall 1993-1997 ‚Äì a retrospective box set, issued in 2014 via Century Media. Limited to 5000 copies, the set collects Ulver's first demo Vargnatt, together with their first three full-length albums, Bergtatt, Kveldssanger and Nattens madrigal with a bonus four-track rehearsal of songs from Nattens madrigal, recorded in summer 1995.  Critical reception  Vargnatt generally received critical reviews, especially focusing on the low quality recording. Webzine, Lunar Hypnosis, noted: ‚ÄúEven re-mastered 'Vargnatt' is quite raw and its one of those recordings that really just forces you to turn the volume up loudly so you don't miss anything, and that's just one of the things that makes it so interesting, because so much is happening in these songs. I wouldn't go so far as to call it essential listening, because its very irregular artistry, but it surely is interesting hearing what is most likely the first black metal recording to feature an underlining folk presence.‚Äù Metal Soundscapes added: ‚ÄúIt has a great variety in its music styles. Raw black metal, acoustic songs in vein of ‚ÄúKveldssanger‚Äù, avant-garde parts, jazz, rock and gothic influences, are all put together in a very primitive and direct approach. Of course, compared to their future releases, this album is of much lower quality, but it‚Äôs the first sign of what‚Äôs to come.

Altizer (born 1970) is a Professor and Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and the Athletic Association Professor of Ecology in the University of Georgia, Odum School of Ecology. Early life Altizer was born as the daughter of Jim and Chris Altizer of Watkinsville, Georgia. Her passion for biology and the natural world began when she received a gift of a microscope and a grown-your-own-butterflies kit on her twelfth birthday. Education Altizer received a B.S. from Duke University in 1992 and a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1998. She also did a postdoctoral work at Princeton University and Cornell University. Career For 20 years since a graduate student of the University of Minnesota, Altizer traveled the world to study monarch butterfly migration, ecology, and interactions with a protozoan parasite. She has researched how seasonal migration of these butterflies affects parasite transmission, and also developed collaborative databases of mammalian infectious diseases, on host behavior, ecology, and life history interact with global-scale patterns of parasitism. She also focused her research on songbird-pathogen dynamics, including studies of house finch conjunctivitis, West Nile virus, and salmonellosis. Altizer has published several publications and she recently co-edited a book that would be published in 2015, titled Monarchs in a Changing World: Biology and Conservation of an Iconic Insect. She also and participated in high-level task forces dedicated to monarch butterfly conservation. A citizen science project called Monarch Health is run by her students at University of Georgia, which is now the eighth year. There are hundreds of volunteers across North America in sampling wild monarchs for a debilitating disease. Research areas Altizer's research interests are ecology of infectious diseases in natural populations, evolution of host resistance and parasite virulence, insect ecology and evolution, animal migrations, and anthropogenic change and infectious disease dynamics. Personal life When Altizer is not on campus or traveling for work, she rides on her horse in rural Watkinsville with her husband, with whom she has two sons.

Chattock was born in Solihull (then in Warwickshire), the third son of Thomas Chattock, a solicitor. After studying at Rugby School, he too entered the legal profession. However, in the late 1850s he began following his interest in art, exhibiting his work in the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists. From 1869 to 1891, he exhibited in the Royal Academy of Arts. Chattock often painted rural scenes and architectural subjects. In 1872, he completed his most famous works, sixteen etchings that depict the industrial landscape of the Black Country considered an unusual choice for artists. For each etching, Chattock gave a description of what is being portrayed, and often how the objects in the etchings were used in the industry. While these descriptions tell of the \\"intense desolation\\" of the Black Country, due to an industry that \\"ransacked [its] depths\\", Chattock is often focused on what he calls \\"single picturesqueness, if not beauty\\". In 1876 and 1881, he became a member of the RBSA and Royal Society of Painter- Printmakers respectively. He published a manual for other artists entitled Practical Notes on Etchings in 1883. He died at St Vincent's Hall, Clifton, Bristol, age 81.

He studied Irish with the Gaelic League, where he worked from c.1907 to 1920. He took part in the Easter Rising and was interned at Frongoch until December 1916. He was interned for a year in the Irish War of Independence. He wrote articles in Irish from 1914 and published books from 1920. He translated news stories in the Freeman's Journal in 1922‚Äì24, when he went to work in the Free State Oireachtas' translation department, producing Irish versions of official documents, including the 1922 constitution and the current 1937 constitution.

The games started in Sundsvall in 1947 but moved to Falun in 1959. Up to 1991, ski jumping and Nordic combined skiing were also included as a recurring event. Included were also alpine skiing between 1950‚Äì1953 (in √Öre) and biathlon in 1984. Since 1992, the Swedish Ski Games has arranged international cross-country skiing events only. The event is usually held in February‚ÄìMarch as one of the final World Cup competitions during the season. The event is usually held at Lugnet. Lack of snow has sometimes required the event to be moved to other places. History Inspired by Norwegian skiing events Holmennkollrennene (Holmenkollen Ski Festival) and finnish Lahti Ski Games, the Swedish Ski Games were created in 1947. In the inaguaral games, only four nations; Sweden, Norway, Finland and Switzerland attended. In the early years, several venues alternated as host of the games. As a result of a 1957 proposal from the skiing association of Dalarna, Falun took over as hosts; first on trial from 1959 to 1962, later on a permanent basis. In 1979, the Swedish Ski Games was part of the unofficial World Cup season.

Endangered manatees Caribbean manatees (Trichechus manatus) are a tropical marine mammal threatened from survival throughout their range in the United States (US), Mexico, Caribbean Sea, Central and South America. It is highly endangered in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, mostly by human causes in the form of poaching and watercraft mortality. While over 4,800 manatees are left in Florida, less than 700 survive in Puerto Rico. Manatees used to be hunted in Puerto Rico‚Äôs coasts, but are now directly threatened by habitat degradation, speeding boats and jet skis. Indirect threats also include a low reproductive rate, genetic bottleneck and low diversity, lack of immigration of adjacent populations, and exposure to adverse coastal health. If manatees are to survive in Puerto Rico, all stakeholders, including government, academia, environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local corporations and all island residents in general, must work together and actively participate in positive actions of management, research, and community involvement that would enhance the survival of the species and preserve them for future generations. History As a response to this needed effort, the NGO Red Caribe√±a de Varamientos (Caribbean Stranding Network) partnered with the Inter American University of Puerto Rico to implement research, rescue, rehabilitation, and community outreach programs for manatee conservation through the establishment of the Caribbean Manatee Conservation Center Mignucci-Giannoni AA, Mart√≠nez JF. 2015. Capital Improvement Plan for the Puerto Rico Manatee Conservation Center. Centro de Conservaci√≥n de Manat√≠es de Puerto Rico, Red Caribe√±a de Varamientos & Inter American University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR, 30 pp (CMCC). It was previously known as the Puerto Rico Manatee Conservation Center. Through a long-term cooperative agreement, permits and licenses from Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (PRDNER), US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and US Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Network and the University slated academic programs to support research and conservation work in the PRMCC with the participation of students and faculty, as well as the means of seeking funds available to academia and community-based organizations to support the manatee conservation initiatives. While this conservation effort is focused on manatees in Puerto Rico, the CMCC also assists in programs for West Indian manatees in the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Turks and Caicos, Guyana, and Venezuela, and for endangered sister species, such as the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis) in Colombia and Peru, and the West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis) in Taiwan, Nigeria, and Gabon, Africa. These international partnerships have taken the CMCC's scientists, veterinarians, and technicians around the globe to provide assistance and support in rescue, rehabilitation, and population research projects. Conservation initiatives PRMCC implements manatee conservation initiatives in four main fronts or programs: # Rescue and stranding response, # Rehabilitation and veterinary care, # Population research, and # Community outreach and education. =Rescue and stranding response= Up to 15 cases of stranded manatees are reported in Puerto Rico each year. Some of these cases involve animals that have died near shore, either from natural causes or human-related accidents. Other cases reported consist of live manatees, whether ill, injured, or orphaned in need of veterinary attention. The PRMCC is deputized by both the Commonwealth and Federal governments to respond to these stranding events, and conduct an investigation on the cause of death, including a necropsy, or rescue and transport the live animal to the PRMCC's rehabilitation facility for veterinary treatment and care. Through dedicated stranding and mortality research and monitoring, the PRMCC has documented over 120 manatee deaths in Puerto Rico, via salvage and necropsies.Bonde RK, Mignucci-Giannoni AA, Bossart GD. 2012. Sirenian pathology and mortality assessment. In Hines E, Reynolds J, Aragones L, Mignucci Giannoni AA, Marmontel M (eds) Sirenian Conservation: Issues and strategies in developing countries. Gainesville, Florida: University Press of Florida, pp. 148-156. Pathology and disease processes in these cases have been documented cooperatively with veterinary pathologists and manatee biologists of the US Geological Survey (USGS) Sirenia Project in Gainesville, Florida. Since 2015, over 12 successful rescues were conducted in Puerto Rico. =Rehabilitation and veterinary care= Manatee being rescued in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico. The CMCC is one of the 12 facilities federally deputized in the US to hold and care for manatees and one of five critical care manatees facilities. These facilities conform the Manatee Rescue and Rehabilitation Partnership, which includes the following organizations: Cincinnati Zoo, Columbus Zoo, Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Homosassa Springs State Wildlife Park, Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens, Miami Seaquarium, Mote Marine Laboratory, Caribbean Manatee Conservation Center, Save the Manatee Club, Clearwater Marine Aquarium, Sea World Orlando, South Florida Museum, Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo, USFWS, USGS Sirenia Project, University of Florida‚Äôs College of Veterinary Medicine, and Walt Disney World‚Äôs The Seas. As one of the critical care authorized facilities, the CMCC receives ill, injured, or orphaned manatees and provides them with veterinary treatment and rehabilitation care with the main purpose of returning them back to their habitat once they have been cleared of their admission condition and can survive on their own. A team of experienced marine biologists, veterinarians, veterinary technicians, and caretakers with the help of volunteers, provide treatment and care around-the-clock on a full-time basis. Some cases only require minor treatment, while others, particularly orphaned calves, require up to three years of care at the CMCC, and one-year monitoring in the wild. Since 1989, the CMCC has tended over 45 rescue and rehabilitation cases of manatees in Puerto Rico, and offered assistance to more than two dozen cases in the Caribbean (British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Guyana, Mexico, Turks and Caicos, and Venezuela), the Amazon (Peru and Colombia), Taiwan and Gabon and Nigeria, Africa. In Puerto Rico, four manatees have been immediately released after the rescue, seven have been released after rehabilitation (Mois√©s, Rafael, Tuque, Araman√°, Yuisa, Tureygu√°, and Mabo) and four are at present in rehabilitation (Guacara, Lo√≠za, Taicaraya, Bajar√≠). Guacara, originally from Florida, but now a permanent resident of the CMCC, can not be released back to the wild due to floatability problems caused by a boat injury to its right lung in 2008. =Population research= Research on the ecology, life history, genetics, distribution, habitat use, and movement of the manatee population in Puerto Rico have been conducted over the past years in a local, national and international cooperative fashion, particularly with colleagues from the USGS Sirenia Project, North Carolina State University, and Universidad de los Andes (Colombia). These efforts have resulted in an edited book (Sirenian Conservation: Issues and strategies in developing countriesHines E, Reynolds J, Aragones L, Mignucci Giannoni AA, Marmontel M (eds). Sirenian Conservation: Issues and strategies in developing countries. Gainesville, Florida: University Press of Florida, 326pp.), and over 80 joint publications, analyzing major causes affecting the survival of this species.

The new frontier in manatee research pivots on population health assessment and habitat use through the use of radio-telemetry. Thus, in the coming years, the CMCC will focus its research on manatees through cooperative projects of health assessment, telemetry, genetics, and aerial surveys. Since detrimental activities that have led to the manatee endangerment include habitat degradation, which in turn influences manatee health and the particular use of specific habitats, the CMCC seeks to ascertain the effects of these factors in the survival of the manatee in Puerto Rico. =Community outreach and education= Extensive community outreach efforts have also been a priority for the CMCC, including the education of school children and the general public, and the production of brochures and posters for free distribution. Two books for young children have been printed in 2010 and 2011, educating about the plight for survival of manatees in Caribbean waters. * Aunque viva en el agua.Mignucci A. 2011. Aunque viva en el agua. Ediciones SM, 31pp. * El manat√≠ de Puerto Rico.Mignucci A. 2010. El manat√≠ de Puerto Rico. Red Caribe√±a de Varamientos & Universidad Interamericana de Puerto Rico, 57pp. New educational material for children as well as for boaters, kayakers, divers and jetskiers, is being produced in a cooperative effort with sister organizations. Additional educational material is also available for teachers and can be downloaded for the general public on the CMCC's website www.manatipr.org. A public service announcement (PSA) campaign in the two major local newspapers (El Nuevo D√≠a and Primera Hora) is also used to make the community aware of the need of conservation efforts for manatees in the island. Through CMCC's encouragement and active campaign, Puerto Rico‚Äôs government declared by law in 2013 that the manatee would be the National Mammal of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and assigned each year 7 September as the \\"Day for Caribbean Manatee Conservation\\" in the island. This designation through Law 127 of 31 October 2013 is the first official designation of a national wildlife symbol for Puerto Rico. During its first and second celebration in 2013 and 2014, over 50 schools and 20,000 students celebrated 7 September as \\"manatee day\\" with environmental activities, talks, and the writing of advocacy letters to help in manatee conservation in the island. During the week of 7 September 2015, the PRMCC together with some 300 elementary and secondary school teachers, impacted over 45,000 students on the island regarding the manatee's plight for survival and the need for conservation measures to prevent their extinction. Part of CMCC‚Äôs community outreach efforts include involving students as volunteers, and inviting college interns to practice and gain experience in marine wildlife conservation initiatives at the CMCC. Biology, marine sciences, and environmental sciences students participate in the daily activities of CMCC, including husbandry, veterinary care, scientific research, conservation, and community outreach and education. Over 90 volunteers and interns are associated with the CMCC's activities, learning first hand on manatee conservation. The CMCC also arranges for its technicians and volunteers to gain experience in internships abroad with collaborative institutions in the US and throughout Latin America. The CMCC is also a facility where elementary, middle and high school children, university students, as well as the public and tourists may visit to observe first hand the research and rehabilitation work in a way to inspire them to get involved in environmental conservation through community service. Over 10,000 visitors come through CMCC each year to receive a short lecture on manatee conservation and see the work behind the scenes to help this species survive. News media, TV and newspapers, regularly cover CMCC's conservation activities and progress of manatee patients under veterinary care. As a result of this coverage and CMCC's community outreach efforts, the US Environmental Protection Agency awarded the Network the \\"Environmental Quality Award\\" in 2004. National Geographic documented their work for the television series Earth Pulse, which aired worldwide in 2002 and 2003. In 2012, the syndicated ABC television program Ocean Mysteries with Jeff Corwin filmed CMCC‚Äôs manatee conservation efforts, and the episode aired to 1.5 million viewers in the US in March 2013. In 2014, Windfall Films recorded a section for the PBS and England‚Äôs Channel 4 program \\"Born in the Wild\\" featuring CMCC‚Äôs work on manatee calf rearing. The episode was seen during the summer of 2014 by some 821,000 viewers in the United Kingdom, and over 1.2 million viewers in the US. In 2017, PBS TV and BBC TV presented two documentaries (\\"Viva Puerto Rico\\" and \\"Puerto Rico: Island of Enchantment\\") which included and showcased the work of the CMCC, with a TV audience of over 5 million viewers. In 2020, the documentary was re-transmitted in Spanish by Animal Planet. Infrastructure The CMCC was conceived to include a state- of-the-art facility dedicated to conduct research, rescue, rehabilitation and community outreach programs for this endangered marine species to further their conservation, health, and well-being. The facility was designed by architect Andr√©s Mignucci to consist of a series of laboratories and tanks to run PRMCC‚Äôs programs. The laboratories include spaces for marine research, veterinary treatment, telemetry, osteological collection, animal food preparation, as well as offices for program coordinators. The rehabilitation area consists of 9 tanks. The tanks and filter system, totaling some 80,000 gallons of fresh-water, can accommodate 5 adult manatees and 10 calves in rehabilitation. The life support building contains 17 commercial rapid-sand filters and IntelliFlo pumps that process all water every 50 minutes allowing for excellent water quality that it is both healthy for the manatees and adequate for public viewing. A 2-ton, 16-foot mast, 16-feet jib crane sits between the calf and medical tanks to weigh and move animals. The CMCC also has a 26-foot tunnel-hull capture boat, two pick-up trucks and a rescue truck for manatee rescues and field research. The facility‚Äôs first and second phases were constructed between 2010 and 2012 with funding from the Puerto Rico Legislature, the Inter American University, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and through donations from over 25 corporation and foundations. Capital improvement plan The CMCC, through its founding partners (Caribbean Stranding Network and the Inter American University of Puerto Rico), is committed to enhancing implementing research, rescue, rehabilitation, and community outreach programs for manatee conservation. A capital improvement plan has been slated by the PRMCC and includes development steps for (1) Financing the yearly operation of the CMCC; (2) Completing the infrastructure of rehabilitation tanks for better functioning, including a false floor in the medical tank, automatic chlorination, and an ozone filtration system; (3) Constructing Phase 3 of the PRMCC, including laboratories, veterinary clinic, husbandry areas, and a community outreach room to receive the general public; and (4) Refurbishing quarantine tanks and constructing aquaculture ponds for the aquaponic cultivation of aquatic plants (water hyacinths and water thyme) that will serve as food for the manatees in rehabilitation in a sustainable manner. Those corporations, agencies, foundations, or institutions that participate in this capital improvement plan become what the CMCC calls Amigos del Manat√≠ (friend of the manatee), a way for them to show corporate social responsibility and environmental stewardship. The Caribbean Stranding Network as a non-profit The Caribbean Stranding Network is duly registered in the Commonwealth‚Äôs State and Treasury departments as a non-profit organization. It is deputized by the Commonwealth and Federal wildlife government agencies to rescue and rehabilitate these endangered species. The Network is run by an executive director overseen by a board of directors. The Network staff that operates the PRMCC is composed of the director, veterinarians, program coordinators, technicians, and volunteers. The Network, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, finances its conservation efforts through donations from private corporations, Puerto Rico Legislature Community Funds, and limited endangered species funds from the Commonwealth and Federal governments. In-kind donations from several key corporations have been crucial in allowing the Network and the PRMCC to continue its conservation efforts. The Inter American University The Inter American University of Puerto Rico is a private non-profit university founded in 1912 and dedicated to uniting academic excellence with leadership and service to society. The University has 11 university campuses throughout Puerto Rico accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, including schools of law, optometry and aeronautics, and three college-preparatory schools. The Bayam√≥n campus, where the PRMCC is located, is a sciences and engineering-oriented campus, now featuring a bachelor's degree in marine sciences and a master's degree in biology. The governing body of the university is its Board of Trustees, which perpetuates itself and whose members are elected freely without interference from any external authority. The President of the University is the executive officer and senior scholar at the Institution. Chancellors lead each campus of the University system. The Inter American University of Puerto Rico is one of the largest private universities in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, with a student body of 42,000.

The memorial statue was dedicated on August 28, 1998, the 35th anniversary of King's \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. It depicts King plus three allegorical sculptures: a man who symbolizes the American worker, a woman who represents immigration, and a young girl shown releasing King's coattail, who represents, according to Dente, the \\"letting go\\" that occurs when people sacrifice their time and energy to engage in a struggle. The sculpture is part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection, courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council. Lee P. Brown and Vera Katz, mayors of Houston and Portland, respectively, were present at the dedication ceremony. The memorial has been used as a reference point for gatherings. It has also appeared in public art guides and walking tours. Seventy-five bronze replicas of the work exist, and Dente planned to send pieces of the original mold to each of the replicas' owners once all were sold. Description The statue is located outside the Oregon Convention Center. The Dream is an bronze statue depicting Martin Luther King Jr. It is located at the intersection of Northeast Holladay Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, outside the northeast corner of the Oregon Convention Center in the Rose Quarter of Portland's Lloyd District. King is shown \\"stepping forward with conviction to deliver his powerful message\\". He is surrounded by three allegorical figures: behind and to King's right is a young white man with his sleeves rolled up who symbolizes the working American; Note: Image 9 of 17. directly behind King is a woman wading ashore who represents the country's immigration history; and behind and to the left of King is a young girl, shown releasing King's coattail, who represents \\"intergenerational respect\\". Plaque According to Dente, the working class man \\"has come to the realization and made the decision to step forward to announce his support for the universal message of equality, freedom and justice\\". Dente described the girl's release of King's coattail as \\"a 'letting go' process when one or more members of a family is called away to contribute their energy and time to a concept and struggle of greatest importance to all people of the world.\\" The artist dedicated the monument to King's sacrifices, to those who believe in King's message, and to the \\"ongoing march for truth and justice\\". Business and organizations that contributed $10,000 or more to the project are recognized at the statue. Funders included ARCO, Chevron Corporation, Fred Meyer, The Greenbrier Companies/Gunderson, Inc., International Art Group, Kaiser Permanente, Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, Meier & Frank, Oregon Health & Science University, Oregon Labor Unions AFL‚ÄìCIO, Oregon Lottery, Portland Development Commission, Portland Trail Blazers, RH Parker/United Foundation, US West, and the William G. Gilmore Fund of the Oregon Community Foundation. The work is part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection, courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council. Seventy-five bronze replicas exist; once the replicas were purchased, Dente planned to send pieces of the mold to each of the replicas' owners. History U.S. Senator Mark Hatfield spoke at a fundraising breakfast for the sculpture. Paul Knauls, a local resident and entrepreneur who was described as the \\"unofficial mayor\\" of Northeast Portland, was \\"instrumental\\" in securing funding for the sculpture's design. Cheryl Perrin and Betsy Brumm coordinated fundraising, with assistance from Charles Lewis; before Lewis invited U.S. Senator Mark Hatfield, for whom he had worked as an intern, to speak at a breakfast fundraiser, fundraising efforts had stalled for eight years. Oregon's Congressional delegation wrote appeals to large companies, requesting their support at the breakfast. Within six months of the campaign's re-launch, $300,000 was raised, enough to create the sculpture. The Dream was dedicated by the Martin Luther King, Jr. Statue Foundation on August 28, 1998, the 35th anniversary of King's \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. It was also dedicated by Harry Belafonte and much of the Congressional delegation. John Jenkins, chairman of the foundation, said in a statement announcing the statue and its dedication: > Our dream began in the hearts of the students at Martin Luther King, Jr., > Elementary School nearly ten years ago. The dream was nurtured by the late > state Senator Bill McCoy, and through the donations of Oregonians and some > of our state's most respected businesses; we will have an original work of > art honoring the memory and ideals of one of America's greatest leaders. Jeff Blosser, general manager of the Oregon Convention Center, said, \\"It is an honor for the Oregon Convention Center as well as our city, to have this significant sculpture placed here. It will be a very visible symbol for Oregonians, as well as the thousands of visitors who come to our state each year.\\" Dedication ceremony attendees included local educator Laverne Davis, who served as \\"Mistress of Ceremonies\\"; Lee P. Brown and Vera Katz, mayors of Houston and Portland, respectively; Mike Burton of the regional government Metro; Charles Jordan, director of Portland Parks & Recreation; Bishop A. A. Wells; and Dente. Music was provided by the Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School Choir, Ada Tillis, and the Accelerated Music Group. In 2014, Knauls shared with Oregon Public Broadcasting that he considers the project one of his proudest accomplishments. He said the project was a major undertaking and said that \\"it's still surprising how many people don't even know the statue is there\\". The memorial has been used as a place for gatherings. Charles Lewis announced his candidacy for Portland City Commissioner near the memorial in 2007. In 2008, a march honoring King began at the statue. In 2014, the sculpture served as the first stop on a \\"Housing History Tour\\" of Portland, sponsored by the Fair Housing Council of Oregon, the Portland Human Rights Commission, and Race Talks.

In a racing career which lasted from October 2003 until August, 2006 he ran fourteen times and won two races. He won one minor race as a two-year-old and was beaten in his first three races of 2004. In June 2004, however, he recorded an upset 33/1 victory in the Prix du Jockey Club. He failed to finish better than third in eight further races, was sold in the autumn of 2006, and became a breeding stallion in Switzerland. Background Blue Canari is a chestnut horse with a small white star bred in France by the Meridian Stud. He was sired by Acatenango, a three-time German Horse of the Year whose other progeny include the Japan Cup winner Lando and the Hong Kong Vase winner Borgia. Blue Canari's dam, Delicieuse Lady, raced in Scandinavia and won four races, including one at Copenhagen in 1997. Delicieuse Lady was a daughter of Savoureuse Lady, who won the Prix Fille de l'Air and was a half-sister to Mtoto. In August 2002, Blue Canari was consigned by the Haras du Mezeray to the Deauville yearling sale and was bought for ‚Ç¨135,000 by the Chantilly Bloodstock Agency, acting on behalf of Jean-Louis Bouchard. The colt was sent into training with Pascal Bary and was ridden in most of his races by Thierry Thulliez. Racing career =2003: two-year-old season= Blue Canari began his racing career in a contest for previously unraced colts and geldings over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 21 October in which he finished third, beaten three quarters of a length and a nose by Fast And Furious and Mistral D'Arnoult. Seventeen days later, the colt started at odds of 7/2 for the Prix Mieuxce over 1800 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse and recorded his first success, taking the lead 150 metres from the finish and winning by a head from Reefscape, a colt who went on to win the Prix du Cadran. =2004: three-year- old season= In the spring of 2004, Blue Canari ran in three trial races for the Prix du Jockey Club. On 4 April, he stayed on in the straight to finish third behind Prospect Park and Millemix in the Listed Prix de Courcelles over 2100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. When moved up in class for the Group Two Prix Greffulhe over the same course and distance three weeks later, he again finished strongly to take fifth behind Millemix, Esperanto, Day Or Night, and Vasilievsky. He was promoted to fourth after Esperanto was relegated for causing interference in the straight. He was then stepped up in distance for the Listed Prix de l'Avre over 2400 metres on 19 May and finished third behind Reefscape and Ange Gardien, appearing to be outpaced by the first two in the closing stages. On 6 June, Blue Canari, ridden as usual by Thulliez, started a 33/1 outsider for the 167th running of the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400 metres at Chantilly Racecourse. Prospect Park, Reefscape, Day Or Night, and Ange Gardien were again in opposition, whilst the other leading contenders included the British-trained Day Flight, the Prix Hocquart winner Lord du Sud, Delfos (Prix La Force), and Valixir (Prix Matchem). Thulliez held the colt up at the back of the fifteen-runner field and was eleventh on the final turn. He began to make progress 400 metres from the finish, emerged as a serious challenger in the closing stages, and overtook Prospect Park in the final stride to win by a head, with Valixir and Day Flight just behind. His victory was a fifth in the race for Bary after Celtic Arms, Ragmar, Dream Well, and Sulamani, the first two of which were also owned by Bouchard. After the race, both trainer and jockey of the winner admitted to being surprised by the result. Bary revealed that the horse had only taken his chance because Bouchard had said in a telephone conversation five days earlier that it would be \\"amusing\\" to run. Thulliez said, \\"I couldn't believe it. I rode a very economical race because we didn't think he had a first chance but he found a tremendous turn of foot and battled to the line.\\" After a break of more than three months, Blue Canari returned for an autumn campaign. He finished fifth behind Valixir in the Prix Niel with Bary saying after the race that the colt was \\"very rusty\\" following his lengthy absence. He then ran twelfth behind Bago when a 40/1 outsider for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in October. =2005 & 2006: later career= Blue Canari ran four times as a four-year-old. He finished seventh behind Bago in the Prix Ganay, sixth behind Geordieland in the Grand Prix de Chantilly, and fourth behind Ostankino in the Prix Maurice de Nieuil. On his final appearance of the year, he was moved up in distance and finished fourth to Reefcape in the 3100 metre Prix Gladiateur at Longchamp in September. Blue Canari remained in training as a five-year-old in 2006 and made two appearances. He finished third in a minor race at Longchamp in April and sixth in a similar event at Deauville-Clairefontaine Racecourse in August. Stud record In November 2006, Blue Canari was offered for sale at Tattersalls and bought for 90,000 guineas by the Swiss-based Gestut Sohrenhof, and was exported to stand as a breeding stallion in Switzerland. He has sired a few winners, but nothing of top-class.

It is designed to deliver nucleotide analogues (as monophosphate) into the cell (ProTide: PROdrug + nucleoTIDE). It was invented by Professor Chris McGuigan (School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cardiff University) in the early 1990s. They form a critical part of the anti-viral drugs sofosbuvir, tenofovir alafenamide and Remdesivir. General representation of a ProTide  History  A generic diaryl phosphate pro-drug of AZT The first breakthroughs in ProTide research was made in 1992, when the McGuigan group noted the efficacy of aryloxy phosphates and phosphoramidates. In particular, diaryl phosphates were prepared from zidovudine (AZT) using simple phosphorochloridate chemistry. For the first time, the anti-HIV activity of these phosphate derivatives of AZT exceeded that of the parent nucleoside in some cases. Moreover, while AZT was almost inactive (EC50 100ŒºM) in the JM cell line, the substituted diaryl phosphate was 10-times more active (EC50 10ŒºM). At the time, it was considered that JM was AZT-insensitive due to poor phosphorylation. It later emerged that an AZT-efflux pump was the source of this poor AZT sensitivity. However, the conclusion remains valid that the diaryl phosphate was more able to retain activity in the JM cell line, and that this may imply a (small) degree of intracellular phosphate delivery. The electron-withdrawing power of the p-nitro groups and putative enhancements in aryl leaving group ability were suggested as the major driving force of this SAR. AZT protide Subsequently, a series of aryloxy phosphoramidates of AZT was prepared with various p-aryl substituents and several amino acids. Compounds were only studied in the AZT-resistant JM cell line to probe potential (implied) AZT-monophosphate release, and the alanine phosphoramidate emerged as strikingly effective. In HIV-1 infected JM all cultures, AZT was inhibitory at 100ŒºM, while the phenyl methoxy alaninyl phosphoramidate was active at 0.8ŒºM. This was taken as the first evidence of a successful nucleotide delivery. It was also noted that in other series there was a marked preference for alanine over leucine (10-fold) and glycine (>100-fold). Moreover, while electron-withdrawing aryl substitution had been noted to be very effective in the diaryl systems, it was detrimental here. Para fluoro substitution had a slight adventitious effect, but not significantly so, while para-nitro substitution led to a 100-fold loss of activity. In a subsequent studies the range of aryl substituents was extended and compounds studied in true TK+ (thymidine kinase competent) and TK- (thymidine kinase deficient) cell lines. None of the phosphoramidates retained the high (2‚Äì4 nM) potency of AZT in TK competent cell lines (CEM and MT-4) against either HIV-1 or HIV-2. However, while AZT lost all of its activity in the TK- deficient cell line CEM/TK-, most of the phosphoramidates retained antiviral activity, thus being ca >10‚Äì35-fold more active than AZT in this assay. Again, alanine emerged as an important component, with the glycine analogue being inactive in HIV-infected CEM/TK- all cultures. In this assay, leucine and phenylalanine were as effective as alanine, although they were less so in CEM/TK+ assays. Thus, the parent phenyl methoxy alanyl phosphoramidate emerged as an important lead compound. Phenyl isoproyl Ala Abacavir monophosphate Stavudine (d4T) was an early application of the ProTide approach. This was a rational choice based on the known kinetics of phosphorylation of d4T. Thus, while the second phosphorylation (AZT-monophosphate to AZT-diphosphate) but not the first phosphorylation (AZT to AZT-monophosphate) is regarded as rate limiting for AZT activation to the triphosphate, the first step (d4T to d4T monophosphate) is thought in general to be the slow step for d4T. Thus, an intracellular (mono)nucleotide delivery should have maximal impact for d4T and similar nucleosides. In the first instance (halo)alkyloxy phosphoramidates of d4T were prepared and found to retain activity in d4T-resistant JM cells. The activity was dependent on the haloalkyl group; the parent propyl system being poorly active. Subsequent studies in HIV-infected CEM/TK- cell cultures revealed the aryloxy phosphoramidates of d4T to be highly effective and, notably, to retain their full activity in CEM/TK- cells. In this study the benzyl ester emerged as slightly more potent than the parent methyl compound, being almost 10-times more active than d4T in CEM/TK+ assays and thus ca 300-500 fold more active than d4T, in CEM/TK- assays.  Current applications  The Protide pro-drugs are useful for delivering phosphonate containing drugs to cell types with high expression of CTSA and CES1, such as immune cells. Tenofovir alafenamide a successful example of this iteration. ProTides are also useful for nucleoside analogues that do not get phosphorylated efficiently by endogenous nucleoside kinases. For the nucleoside GS-334750, the parent of sofusbovir, phosphorylation by nucleoside kinases is effectively nill, and the only way to deliver active nucleotide is through ProTide. A major limitation of ProTides is that they require expression of esterases like CTSA and CES1, which is very high in some cell types like hepatocytes and plays to an advanatage for the treatment of Hepatitis C of Sofosbuvir. Extensive studies followed on these promising d4T derivatives and the ProTide technology was successfully applied to a wide range of nucleoside analogues. In particular, the ProTide approach has been used on several clinically evaluated anti-HCV nucleoside analogues, including the 2013 FDA approved compound sofosbuvir, and the 2016 FDA approved compound, Tenofovir alafenamide. Remdesivir, the only anti-viral FDA-approved to treat COVID-19 also uses the ProTide prodrug technology. Because GS-441524 nucleoside can be phosphorylated and activated, some researchers have argued that Protides are an unnecessary complication in Remdesivir's design and that the parent nucleoside would be a cheaper and more effective COVID-19 drug.https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/14/gilead-should-ditch-remdesivir-and- focus-on-its-simpler-safer- ancestor/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmedchemlett.0c00316 SofosbuvirProTides have been used to delivery key phosphorylated metabolites in inborn errors of metabolism, such as phosphopantothenate for PANK2 deficiency but these have failed in the clinic https://www.biospace.com/article/retrophin-stock-tanks-after-phase-iii-drug- flunks- study/#:~:text=Shares%20of%20Retrophin%20have%20plunged,not%20stack%20up%20against%20placebo.&text;=PKAN%20is%20a%20rare%2C%20genetic,mutation%20in%20the%20PANK2%20gene.

The headset uses \\"room scale\\" tracking technology, allowing the user to move in 3D space and use motion-tracked handheld controllers to interact with the environment. The HTC Vive was unveiled during HTC's Mobile World Congress keynote in March 2015. Development kits were sent out in August and September 2015, and the first consumer version of the device was released in April 2016.  Development  Prototypes of a Valve-produced virtual reality system were demonstrated during 2014. On 23 February 2015, Valve announced SteamVR and that it would demonstrate a \\"SteamVR hardware system\\" at the 2015 Game Developers Conference. HTC officially unveiled its device, Vive, during its Mobile World Congress keynote on 1 March 2015. Preorders started on 29 February 2016 at 10:00 a.m. EST. Valve and HTC have since announced that the headset will be free for selected developers. At Consumer Electronics Show 2016, HTC and Valve unveiled a near-final hardware revision of the device, known as HTC Vive Pre.  History  During his Immersed 2015 keynote, Phil Chen, Chief Content Officer for HTC and founder of the HTC Vive, explained that he \\"stumbled upon VR\\" and later, HTC met Valve, which turned out to be \\"serendipity\\". Chen also explained that HTC and Valve don't have a clear dividing line between each of their responsibilities, and HTC is very much a partner in the research and development process. In June 2016, HTC announced the release of their 'Business Edition' of the Vive for US$1,200 which would include a Professional Use License, a 12-month Commercial Warranty, access to an exclusive support line, a 5-meter (16 ft) cable extension kit, and it included the Deluxe Audio Strap. In November 2016, HTC announced a tether-less VR upgrade kit made by TPCAST. A public model was shown at CES 2017 and had a price of $249. At Google I/O in May 2017, Google announced a new, all in-built 'Standalone VR' system that would be made by the Vive team and also by Lenovo. Whilst in June 2017 Valve revealed details of a second variation of Vive controller which utilizes finger tracking called the Knuckles Vive controller.  Hardware and accessories  * Vive Headset: The Vive headset has a refresh rate of 90 Hz and a 110 degree field of view. The device uses two OLED panels, one per eye, each having a display resolution of 1080√ó1200 (2160√ó1200 combined pixels). Safety features include a front-facing camera that allows the user to observe their surroundings without removing their headset. The software can also use the camera to identify any moving or static objects in a room; this functionality can be used as part of a \\"Chaperone\\" safety system, which will automatically display a virtual wall or a feed from the camera to safely guide users from obstacles or real-world walls. Inside the headset's outer-shell divots are dozens of infrared sensors that detect the base stations' IR pulses to determine the headset's current location in a space. Other sensors include a G-Sensor, gyroscope and proximity sensor. * Vive Controllers: The controllers have multiple input methods including a track pad, grip buttons, and a dual-stage trigger and a use per charge of about 6 hours. Across the ring of the controller are 24 infrared sensors that detect the base stations to determine the location of the controller. The SteamVR Tracking system is used to track the controller location to a fraction of a millimeter, with update rates ranging from 250 Hz to 1 kHz. * Vive Base Stations: Also known as the Lighthouse tracking system are two black boxes that create a 360 degree virtual space. The base stations emit timed infrared pulses at 60 pulses per second that are then picked up by the headset and controllers with sub- millimeter precision. Wireless syncing lowers the amount of wires as well standard threading making the base stations practical to use in a home. * Vive Tracker: A motion tracking accessory; it is designed to be attached to physical accessories and controllers, so that they can be tracked via the Lighthouse system. Vive Trackers feature a connector that can be used to communicate with the accessory it is attached to. On launch, the Vive Tracker was sold as a standalone product, and in bundles with accessories and games designed to integrate with it, such as the Hyper Blaster (a light gun-style controller), and a racquet designed for sports games. Other third-party accessories have been developed for use with Vive Trackers, such as bands designed to be attached to a user's arms or legs to enable body tracking. * Vive Deluxe Audio Strap: In June 2017, HTC released the Deluxe Audio Strap for US$99. It added integrated over-ear headphones as well as improved the HMD's comfort through better weight distribution. * Vive Wireless Adapter: The Vive Wireless Adapter was launched as an accessory in September 2018 for the original Vive and Vive Pro. It allows to connect the Headset with the Computer wirelessly. The Wireless Adapter is priced at $300 for Vive and $360 for Vive Pro. * Valve Index Controllers: The Vive can use the Valve Index controllers (known during development as Knuckle Controllers) developed by Valve. The Vive initially required computers running Microsoft Windows. In February 2017, support was added for Linux, followed by support for MacOS in June 2017.  Games  By March 2016, the time at which the pre-orders for the HTC Vive opened, 107 games were known to be coming to the virtual reality format. In February 2017 Valve CEO Gabe Newell announced via Reddit AMA 'ask me anything' session Valve is developing three AAA VR IPs. Ultimately, in November 2019, Valve announced Half-Life: Alyx as its flagship VR title for the Vive and its own Valve Index headset, to be released in March 2020, though the game will support all headsets compatible with the SteamVR protocol. An open source third party program called Revive allows for Oculus Rift games to be used with the HTC Vive.  Adoption  An unmounted development unit. Valve released its OpenVR software development kit (SDK), an updated version of its Steamworks VR API with documentation and examples of how to build software that supports SteamVR hardware. It provides support for the HTC Vive Developer Edition, including the SteamVR controller and Lighthouse. SteamVR was launched with native support for Unity on its platform. On 30 April 2015, Epic Games announced support for Valve's SteamVR technology, allowing developers to create VR projects with Unreal Engine 4 for the HTC Vive. Epic said that SteamVR is completely integrated into Unreal Engine 4 across Blueprint visual scripting and native code, meaning projects can be built without being dependent on programmer support if needed. Epic's own Showdown tech demo can already be experienced on SteamVR using the Vive headset. In July 2016, VR news website Road to VR used game session figures from the Steam VR platform to estimate that approximately 100,000 Vive headsets had been shipped since launch. In the same month, SensoMotoric Instruments (SMI), a computer vision company, integrated its eye tracking technology in the HTC Vive to turn it into a dedicated eye tracking solution for research and professional applications. In November 2016, Vive announced that it would begin the first retail sales of its headsets at JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman stores in Australia later that month. On 23 November 2016, HTC announced that the Vive was sold at a profit and that HTC Vive sales were \\"much higher\\" than 140,000.  Vive Pro  An HTC Vive Pro On 8 January 2018, HTC unveiled an upgraded Vive model known as HTC Vive Pro. It features higher-resolution displays, now at 1440x1600 resolution per eye, along with a second outward-facing camera, attachable headphones, a microphone for noise cancellation analysis, and a refreshed design with a more \\"balanced\\" form, lighter weight, and a sizing dial. The Vive Pro uses a USB 3.0 (USB Type A) and a DisplayPort connector to connect to the PC. A hidden USB-C connector can be used to connect an additional USB device to the Vive Pro HMD. The Vive Pro is sold alongside the original as a high-end model, either as a full bundle or headset-only. The Vive Pro headset-only package is targeted towards existing Vive users, as Lighthouse base stations are required to use the headset, but not included in the package. Two different bundles are sold since April 2018: The Vive Pro Starter Kit includes a Vive Pro Headset and the original SteamVR 1.0 Lighthouse base stations, as well as controllers. The Vive Pro Full Kit includes a Vive Pro Headset and the more recent SteamVR 2.0 Lighthouse base stations, as well as controllers. The Vive Pro, that can be used both with SteamVR 1.0 and SteamVR 2.0 Lighthouse base stations, is compatible with all existing Vive accessories. However, not all Vive accessories support both available versions of the Lighthouse base stations. SteamVR 2.0 base stations can not be used in combination with the controllers shipped with the standard Vive Package and the initial Vive Trackers (before \\"Vive Tracker 2018\\"). SteamVR 2.0 base stations enable the use of more than two base stations in one (optically undivided) room, allowing for a tracked space of up to 10 x 10 m in size.  Vive Pro Eye  In January 2019, at CES 2019 HTC unveiled an upgraded variant of HTC Vive Pro called Vive Pro Eye. The new device features built-in eye tracking that enables foveated rendering and hands-free interaction in VR and accessibility options for users who can't use regular motion controllers.  Vive Focus  Vive Focus is a self-contained (as opposed to tethered to a computer) headset first launched in China and then worldwide (in 37 countries) in November 2018. The headset introductory price in US was US$599.  Vive Cosmos  An HTC Vive Cosmos In November 2018 HTC filed a \\"Vive Cosmos\\" trademark application. The headset was officially unveiled on January 7 in a very brief announcement at CES 2019 and via Twitter. The presentation video showed a headset with a flip-up screen enabling user to see the real world without taking off the headset completely, four inside-out tracking cameras (two in the front and one on each side) and two handset motion controllers. In late 2019, it was revealed that HTC will be making three additional Vive Cosmos models, alongside the original, the Vive Cosmos Play, a lower cost version of the Cosmos with a faceplate without any cameras, lowering the tracking ability of the headset, and no headphones, the HTC Vive Cosmos XR, which had improved cameras for mixed reality content, and was standalone, similar to the Vive Focus and Oculus Quest, and the HTC Vive Cosmos Elite which featured a faceplate that supports SteamVR 2.0 tracking and included two original Vive controllers and base stations. In March 2020 HTC released a version of the Vive Cosmos Elite which only included the headset, without the controllers and basestations, and in April 2020, HTC released the HTC Vive Cosmos External Tracking Faceplate, which would allow users to use SteamVR 2.0 on a Vive Cosmos or Vive Cosmos Play, without replacing the entire headset.

In the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election he was elected into the Ukrainian parliament for Petro Poroshenko Bloc placed number 40 on the party list. He became deputy head of the faction. Leshchenko, Naim and Zalishchuk leave the BPP. Why now and what's next?, BBC Ukrainian (28 February 2019) On 23 February 2017, it was reported that Honcharenko had been kidnapped by unidentified attackers in Odessa. A few hours in a televised interview Honcharenko said he \\"was in a safe place\\" and Ukrainian prosecutors reported that the people involved in the kidnapping had been detained. Honcharenko claimed that his abduction was staged by the Ukrainian Security Service so that \\"separatist, terrorist groups operating in Odessa who planned causing me serious bodily harm\\" could be arrested. In October 2017, the deputy from the Opposition Bloc, Nestor Shufrych, during the show on the NewsOne TV channel told Honcharenko that he considered himself as his godfather in politics. In 2010, Shufrich helped resolve the conflict between Oleksiy and his father, Oleksiy Kostusyev. Oleksiy then didn't prevent his father from being elected as mayor of Odessa with the guarantee of Honcharenko's election in the Verkhovna Rada. On 1 November 2018, Oleksiy Honcharenko was included in the Russian sanctions list in connection with Ukraine‚Äôs unfriendly actions towards citizens and legal entities of the Russian Federation. In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election Hocharenko was reelected as an independent candidate in single-seat constituency 137 (Podilsk).https://ukr.lb.ua/news/2019/07/23/432913_nardep_goncharenko_prohodit_radi.html =Controversies= In January 2015, Ukrainian blogger and journalist Anatoly Shariy published a video showing that Oleksiy Honcharenko traveled on the Celebrity Silhouette cruise ship in the Caribbean. Honcharenko was criticized for going on an expensive vacation during the War in Donbass. On 1 March 2015 Hocharenko was arrested by Russian police during Nemtsov Memorial March. According to Honcharenko when in detention he was beaten and deprived of medical and legal help. Honcharenko was released from prison the next day but he promised to sue Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. With the release of Honcharenko from the Moscow's \\"Kitay-gorod\\" police department, the people's deputy was returned his $ 6,150. Honcharenko explained the origin of money as a donation of a Russian citizen to the annual Odessa marathon. He stated this on Channel 5. In July 2015, Oleksiy Honcharenko received online instructions from the SBU head Vasyl Hrytsak during the Shuster Live TV show. When Honcharenko began showing photos of the detention and arrest of a large sum of money from one of the court‚Äôs leaders in the Kherson Oblast, a push-message from Hrytsak displayed on the screen of the smartphone: ‚ÄúTalk about the Service, that it is changing, it‚Äôs starting to work, do not gain your publicity!‚Äù In August 2015, during the meeting of the Presidium of the Odessa Oblast Council the Governor of Odessa Oblast Mikheil Saakashvili called Oleksiy Honcharenko and the head of the Council Mykhaylo Shmushkovych \\"thieves and criminals.\\" Saakashvili also said that \\"they all will sit [in jail].\\" On 4 June 2016, the Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine opened criminal proceedings against Oleksiy Honcharenko under section 110, Part 2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (Encroach on territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine) and section 161 (Part 2) (Violation of equality of citizens depending on their race and their religion beliefs). These cases were opened in response to the deputy appeal of Ihor Mosiychuk. He claimed that Honcharenko \\"promoted the ideas of the 'Russian World' in Odessa, communicated with FSB officers and worked against Ukraine.\\" Goncharenko denied the accusations of representative of the Radical Party, described these cases as \\"nonsense.\\" On 8 February 2017, Oleksiy Honcharenko painted with red paint the word \\"Nein\\" (which is translated from German as \\"No\\") on the fragment of the Berlin Wall, installed in front of the Embassy of Germany in Kyiv. With this action, Honcharenko protested against the statement of the German Ambassador to Ukraine, Ernst Reichel, who said that the absence of Russian troops was not a prerequisite for holding elections in the Donbass. The Embassy of Germany in Kyiv responded to the incident with the following statement: \\"The Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany is very much regretting the damage and disfigurement of the fragment of the historic Berlin Wall located on the territory of the Embassy by deputy Honcharenko. At the same time, there is a violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.\\" The Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Yuriy Lutsenko, announced the opening by the Prosecutor‚Äôs Office in Kyiv the criminal case against Honcharenko on the fact of hooligan actions at the German Embassy: \\"On the fact of hooliganism at the German Embassy, the Kyiv Prosecutor‚Äôs Office opened a criminal proceedings on the legal qualification of Part 1 of Art. 296 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.

He said that without gloves it would be \\"unsafe to shake hands and touch door handles\\", hinting at the accusations of Russia in the poisoning of Skripals. Assembly President, Liliane Maury Pasquier (Switzerland), made a remark to the Ukrainian deputy: \\"Mr. Honcharenko, I want to remind you that we are not on the stage of the theater, so it‚Äôs not necessary to use different props for changing clothes.\\" Earnings In 2010, in an interview with journalist Roman Skrypin, Honcharenko explained the origin of the 700 thousand dollars indicated in the 2010 declaration.

Built c. 1910 by Maine businessman Amos Gerald, the house is notable both for its architecture, which is best described as resembling a medieval castle, and for its association with Gerald, who was a major proponent of electrification in the state, and who built many of the state's (now defunct) trolley systems. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Gerald House is set on the northwest side of Main Street (United States Route 201) on the fringe of Fairfield's central business district. It is a two-story building with a prominent centrally-placed three-story round tower that has a crenellated parapet. The building is fashioned out of concrete blocks that are finished to resemble rusticated stone. Its roof is flat, and the main roof originally had a parapet similar to that of the tower. Surrounding the tower on the front is a single-story porch supported by thick columns, also fashioned out of concrete blocks, and sporting a crenellated parapet. A wood frame addition extends to the rear of the main block. Amos Gerald (1841-1913) was born in nearby Benton, and settled in Fairfield in the 1860s after traveling to the American West. He is principally known for establishing more than a dozen electric trolley systems across the state of Maine, and establishing the state's first electric power plant in Fairfield in 1886. He supposedly personally supervised the fabrication of the concrete blocks that were used in building this house, which may be the first residential structure in the state built using that material. It is the only known house in the state with medieval castle features.

Mark Hapka, Jessica Rothe, Eric Jungmann, and Constance Wu star as people who are thrown into alternate Earths that range from subtly different to post-apocalyptic. It was released in March 2015 on the Netflix streaming service. It was announced on November 16, 2016 that Neil Gaiman would be collaborating with Christopher Leone and Albert Kim to adapt the teaser/trailer film into a TV series, titled \\"The Building\\". However, to date no further information about the TV series has been released since 2016 and the project appears to have been cancelled.  Plot  Ronan and Beatrix each receive a message from their father, Alex, who requests they meet him. Curious, they separately converge at their father's house, where they find him missing, though Ronan recovers a strange, ball-shaped device. When Harry, Beatrix's friend, arrives, he joins them in their attempts to locate their father despite Ronan's dislike for him. Harry, a public defender, suggests that they contact the police. However, Captain Stone can offer little help to them, as they have no evidence of wrongdoing. He directs them to the building Alex described and tells them that it is abandoned. The three find the building empty and covered in graffiti that describes alternate timelines and histories. Initially dismissive of the seemingly nonsensical graffiti, they discover that the building has transported them to an alternate Earth devastated by nuclear blasts. When they see a roving patrol shoot down pedestrians, they flee back into the building, where they meet Polly. Polly, a traveler between worlds, explains that the building transports anyone within it to a new, random world if they return to it in exactly 36 hours. In hostile worlds such as the one in which they currently reside, she suggests that they stay inside the building and not interact with the locals. The group sleeps to pass the time. They are woken by an armed patrol, who take them to meet the leader of the local settlement. Polly takes charge and convinces him that they are merely confused travelers. Recognizing Captain Stone as their leader, Harry thanks him for his help. Stone, suddenly distrustful of outsiders who know both his name and former occupation, takes them hostage and orders Tinker, the local surgeon and gadget-man, to interrogate them. Tinker shows them footage of a terrorist attack via suitcase nuke, and Ronan and Beatrix are horrified to recognize their father as the perpetrator. Ronan breaks free, knocks Tinker unconscious and frees the others. Desperate for revenge against Alex, Tinker sets off with his own suitcase nuke to destroy the building. The group returns to the building just in time to escape the blast and transport to the next world, though they do not know that Tinker transports with them. This world is technologically advanced, and the group splits up to learn more about both it and Alex. Ronan and Polly explore Alex's house, which turns out to be empty. Ronan reveals that he blames himself for his mother's death, and Polly seems confused when he jokingly quotes slang from her world back to her. Ronan shows her the device he found earlier, and she says that it could only be from the \\"core world\\" where the building was constructed. They flee the house when they find a hidden warning and a team of assassins attack them. Beatrix and Harry discover, that in this world he is a wealthy and corrupt corporate lawyer. They hack into his computer and learn that this world's Alex was killed in an accident and Ronan apparently never existed. Harry sends evidence of his double's wrongdoing to the media, and they return to the building, where they find that Tinker has apparently taken Ronan and Polly hostage. Beatrix threatens to kill Tinker, but Ronan convinces her to allow Tinker to use an invention that hacks into the building. Impressed with the device, Alex reveals himself after stepping out from a secure elevator. Alex directs Tinker to the top floor of the building, where he says Tinker will find answers. Once Tinker leaves, Alex tells his children that he and their mother were not born on what they perceived as their home world. Tinker returns from the elevator, yelling to them not to trust Alex, and Alex shoots and kills Tinker. Alex leaves the building after telling Ronan and Beatrix that they must find their mother, who they insist is dead, in order to return to the core world. After the building transports them once again, three different versions of Polly convene in secret and two of them play rock-paper- scissors to presumably determine who will accompany the rest of the group into the next world.

The First of Boston's answer to this problem has been to develop, as a vital part of its international distributed processing network, a worldwide corporate MIS called the Total Customer Relationship system (TCR).

The architectural model consists of a set of building-blocks of linked architectures which together form the basis for the technology infrastructure of the firm.\\"Synnott (1987, p. 199). In this context Synnott also spoke about the role of data architecture and communication architecture. He explained, that: :\\"... data architecture and communication architecture are shown as horizontal bars because these are corporate-wide information resource components. They serve all business units. The four vertical resource components are business specific. The resources can be divided according to the business units they serve. That us, data and communication might be centralizes resources, whereas human resources (professional systems staffs), computers, user-computing, and systems could all be decentralized resources to one degree or another.\\"  Selected publications  * Synnott, William R., and William H.

The film begins with Ellen Stokes whose extravagant lifestyle is outside the means of the family. While their only son is hosting a birthday party, the husband informs Ellen that they are financially ruined because of her. Ellen attempts to get money from her uncle, who refuses, and a friend of the family soon comes to her aid with a loan. Ellen is deceptive in telling who provided the money and her jealous husband soon learns the truth. In anger, he takes the child and leaves. The child soon returns to Ellen and she whisks him away to a new home where she fails to obtain gainful employment. The son decides to sell newspapers for some money and in this job is recognized by his father, soon the family is reunited. Marie Eline played the role of \\"their child\\" and was likely so well disguised that the reviewer for The Nickelodeon believed her to be a boy. The film was released on October 21, 1910, and was met with positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from October 22, 1910. It states: \\"Ellen Stokes is a loving wife and mother, but she has one fault - extravagance. On the day that her only child is playing the host at a birthday party, Ellen's husband informs her that he is practically ruined, and places the fault at her door. Ellen, conscience stricken, declares that she will aid her husband, and tells him that she will induce her rich uncle to aid them. When she talks to him on the subject, she finds that he is not disposed to aid her. Soon after his refusal, a friend of the family drops in, finds Ellen in tears, learns of her trouble, and offers a loan which she finally accepts. The woman's husband is of a jealous nature and when Ellen gives him the money, he asks if it came from the other man. She hastily denies it, and says that her uncle was the one. The husband takes the money, and later finds that his wife has deceived him. In anger he leaves the house, taking their only child with him.\\" \\"When Ellen finds that she has been deserted, she listens to the pleadings of the other man and is about to elope with him, when the baby, Tom, unexpectedly appears. He has run away from his father, and trudged through the streets, alone, to rejoin his mother. The woman clasped her child in her arms and decides to live for him in the future. The mother takes her child to humble lodgings, the whereabouts of which are unknown even to her husband. There she tries to make a living for herself and him by sewing, but is unable to do so. She has given the last crust of bread to the little one, and is herself in a starving condition, when the baby boy himself comes to the rescue by starting out on a business career, selling papers in the street. In this way the wolf is kept from the door for a little while longer, and the little fellow, while applying his trade on the street corner, is met and recognized by his father. With his son as his guide, the repentant husband, who now realizes his unjust action, goes to his wife, and with the baby as a mediator, the two become reconciled.\\"  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The only known credit is for Marie Eline in the role of \\"their child\\". The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying most of the actors in the film. It seems that Marie Eline was so well-disguised as a boy that the reviewer for The Nickelodeon was unable to recognize her true gender. The reviewer state \\"the meeting between the father and his newsboy child also has a touch of originality\\" and \\"[t]he child is a fine little actor, easily making himself the star of the piece.\\" Though this was not lost on the reviewer for The New York Dramatic Mirror which stated, \\"The work of the little girl who plays the leading role in this film is a constant wonder to spectators.\\" Eline had proven herself capable of handling male characters, with the first such credit as a young Italian boy in The Two Roses. Eline would also star as Hans in The Little Hero of Holland.  Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on October 21, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with theaters showing the film in Maryland, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Indiana, and Kansas. In 1917, years after its release, it was later approved by the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors of Moving Pictures for viewing without modification. The film was reviewed positively by the trade publications. The Moving Picture World stated, \\"The dramatic qualities of this film are high, but the subject is somewhat depressing... Maybe the picture will teach the lesson that it is better to listen to explanations at first and save all those intervening years of sorrow and suffering. It ought to, at any rate, because that story is plainly wrought out and is apparent as it is possible to make it.\\" A review in The Nickelodeon offered little more than a summary of the film, but the reviewer found the subject to be enhanced by the attention to detail in the production. The reviewer was also pleased that the child was not brought in to serve as in deus ex machina role. Though Lonergan was fond of using the technique. Even The New York Dramatic Mirror gave some praise to the production, but noted that the acting of the mother's friend was the weakest because \\"[a] man of his [caliber] wouldn't have backed off so quickly.\\" Overall, the reviewer found the acting to be better than the narrative itself and concluded that \\"[s]omething less laboredly sentimental would be much stronger.\\" See also * List of American films of 1910  References  Category:1910 films Category:1910 drama films Category:American drama films Category:American films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Thanhouser Company films Category:Lost American films ","title":"Their Child"},{"id":"45544460","text":"7 Cups (formerly called 7 Cups of Tea) is a website (also available in an app) which provides online therapy and free support to people experiencing emotional distress by connecting them with trained listeners.

She is most known as the kept lover of riksr√•d count Carl Sparre, a relationship which attracted attention and was used by the opposition of Sparre during his political career. Life She was born to the writer Catharina Ahlgren and Bengt Edvard Eckerman, cavalry master of the Royal Scanian Husars, and the sister of Charlotte Eckerman. Her parents separated in 1768 because of her father's adultery and after he had refused to acknowledge her youngest brother. At least she and her sister was brought up with their mother. They were given a fine education and was tutored in the French language. However, the home was poor, and Eckerman later describe that her childhood, though cultivated, was miserable as far as the economy was concerned. Both Julie and her sister Charlotte were active as courtesans or high class prostitutes from an early age. Among her clients were a certain M√ºller, secretary at the German legation in Stockholm, whom she reportedly used as a spy with the Russian ambassador, Andrey Razumovsky. In 1780, she became the mistress of riksr√•d count Carl Sparre, who was known as a libertine, especially after having been widowed by Ulrika Str√∂mfelt; from 1785, she lived openly with him at his Lustschloss Bellevue, officially with the title house keeper. Sparre's political advisories accused him of having wasted the funds he collected through his office on Julie Eckerman, who was said to control his actions and accepted commissions from supplicants who wished to affect him. This was illustrated by a famous political pamphlet. In 1789, Sparre discontinued the relationship because he planned to remarry, and arranged a marriage for Eckerman with Nils Bj√∂rkegren, who was described as a beautiful youth and whom he had made mayor of Link√∂ping.

Ct. at 2357. According to the Supreme Court, in order to be patent eligible, what is claimed must be more than the abstract idea. The implementation of the idea must be something beyond the \\"routine,\\" \\"conventional\\" or \\"generic.\\" In DDR Holdings, the Federal Circuit, applying the Alice analytical framework, upheld the validity of DDR's patent on its webpage display technology.DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1248.  Background  DDR Holdings, LLC (\\"DDR\\") was formed by inventors Daniel D. Ross and D. Delano Ross, Jr. following the asset sale of their dot- com company, Nexchange (which was formed to utilize their invention). DDR filed a lawsuit against twelve entities including Hotels.com, National Leisure Group, World Travel Holdings, Digital River, Expedia, Travelocity.com, and Orbitz Worldwide for patent infringement. DDR settled with all but three of these defendants prior to an October 2012 jury trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The jury found that neither of the patents at issue were invalid, that National Leisure Group, Inc. and World Travel Holdings, Inc. (collectively \\"NLG\\") directly infringed both these patents, that Digital River directly infringed one of the patents, and that DDR should be awarded $750,000 in damages. Following the verdict, the district court denied defendants‚Äô motions for Judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) and entered final judgment in favor of DDR, consistent with the jury's findings. Defendants appealed, however, by the time of oral argument, DDR settled with Digital River, and Digital River's appeal was subsequently terminated. NLG continued its appeal. = Patents-in-suit = DDR is the assignee of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,818,399 (\\"the '399 patent\\") and 6,993,572 (\\"the '572 patent\\"), both of which are continuations of an earlier patent‚ÄîU.S. Patent No. 6,629,135 (\\"the '135 patent\\"). The court's ¬ß 101 analysis focused on the '399 patent, entitled \\"Methods of expanding commercial opportunities for internet websites through coordinated offsite marketing.\\", 2:30‚Äì34. = The Invention = The '399 patent addresses a particular problem in the field of e-commerce when vendors advertise their products and services through a hosting page of an affiliate: > [Vendors] are able to lure visitor traffic away from the affiliate. Once a > visitor clicks on an affiliate ad and enters an online store, that visitor > has left the affiliate's site and is gone. [This presents] a fundamental > drawback of the affiliate programs--the loss of the visitor to the vendor. The '399 patent also identifies some other attempts at solving this problem: > Affiliates are able to use \\"frames\\" to keep a shell of their own website > around the vendor's site, but this is only a marginally effective solution. > Some Internet affiliate sales vendors have begun placing \\"return to > referring website\\" links on their order confirmation screens, an approach > that is largely ineffective. This limitation of an affiliate program > restricts participation to less trafficked websites that are unconcerned > about losing visitors. Search engines and directories continue to increase > in their usefulness and popularity, while banner ads and old-style links > continue their rapid loss of effectiveness and popular usage. The '399 patent claims a process involving stored data concerning the visual elements responsible for the \\"look and feel\\" of the host website, where, upon clicking an ad for a third-party merchant's product, the customer is directed to a hybrid page generated by the host website that is a composite of the third-party merchant's product information and the look and feel elements of the host website. \\"For example, the generated composite web page may combine the logo, background color, and fonts of the host website with product information from the merchant.\\" The Federal Circuit described the '399 patent as follows: > The patents-in-suit disclose a system that provides a solution to this > problem (for the host) by creating a new web page that permits a website > visitor, in a sense, to be in two places at the same time‚Ä¶ [T]he host > website can display a third-party merchant‚Äôs products, but retain its > visitor traffic by displaying this product information from within a > generated web page that ‚Äògives the viewer of the page the impression that > she is viewing pages served by the host‚Äô website.\\" [The system] instructs an > Internet web server of an ‚Äúoutsource provider‚Äù to construct and serve to the > visitor a new, hybrid web page that merges content associated with the > products of the third-party merchant with the stored ‚Äúvisually perceptible > elements‚Äù from the identified host website.DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1257. A case note statesSee Richard H. Stern, Case-Law Developments After State Street and AT&T; (Cont'd): After Alice in the Supreme Court: Down the Rabbit Hole? Or Push-Back?, George Washington Law School, Computer Law 484, Cases and Materials, Ch. 8-D (last visited July 22, 2015) (cited hereinafter as GW Computer Law). that one way to accomplish the function would be with an tag (or a tag, which HTML5 allows but no longer supports). The court's opinions use the metaphor of the \\"store within a store\\" to describe what the invention does and how it works, stating that the inventor's idea was to have an Internet webpage that was like a warehouse store or department store (the dissenting opinion uses BJ's Wholesale Clubs as an illustrative example); other merchants' webpages would function like concessions or kiosks within the department store.DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1258, 1265. A commentator asserted that the court's \\"store within a store\\" metaphor may not be the best way to look at this claimed invention, and that it may be more apt to characterize what the invention does as placing a frame around someone else's webpage and incorporating the frame and its content into the host's webpage.GW Computer Law. The diagram of the \\"store within a store\\" or \\"webpage within a webpage\\" in the text following this note is taken from that source. This is the effect that the invention accomplishes: This diagram illustrates what the invention does: producing a webpage wthin a webpage. Representative claim 19 of the '399 patent recites: : \\"19. A system useful in an outsource provider serving web pages offering commercial opportunities, the system comprising: :: (a) a computer store containing data, for each of a plurality of first web pages, defining a plurality of visually perceptible elements, which visually perceptible elements correspond to the plurality of first web pages; ::: (i) wherein each of the first web pages belongs to one of a plurality of web page owners; ::: (ii) wherein each of the first web pages displays at least one active link associated with a commerce object associated with a buying opportunity of a selected one of a plurality of merchants; and :::(iii) wherein the selected merchant, the out-source provider, and the owner of the first web page displaying the associated link are each third parties with respect to one other; :: (b) a computer server at the outsource provider, which computer server is coupled to the computer store and programmed to: ::: (i) receive from the web browser of a computer user a signal indicating activation of one of the links displayed by one of the first web pages; ::: (ii) automatically identify as the source page the one of the first web pages on which the link has been activated; ::: (iii) in response to identification of the source page, automatically retrieve the stored data corresponding to the source page; and ::: (iv) using the data retrieved, automatically generate and transmit to the web browser a second web page that displays: (A) information associated with the commerce object associated with the link that has been activated, and (B) the plurality of visually perceptible elements visually corresponding to the source page.\\", 4-5. = Legal landscape = Under US law, all patentable inventions meet several general requirements: The claimed invention must be: # statutory subject matter #* Judicial interpretation of this statute dictates that natural phenomena, laws of nature, and abstract ideas are not themselves patentable (although a particular application of a law of nature or an abstract idea might be patent- eligible).Diamond v. Chakrabarty, ; e.g. ; Alice, 134 S.Ct. at 2359. # novel.. # nonobvious.. # useful.35 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 101, 112 # fully disclosed and enabled.. As is entirely typical, the defendant argued that DDR's patents were invalid under all of these sections, but the primary litigation focus was on ¬ß 101 and whether DDR's patents were claiming an abstract idea which would not be patentable subject matter. In Alice, the Supreme Court clarified its two-prong framework, originally set forth in Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc.,Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1289. for evaluating the patent-eligibility of a claim under ¬ß 101. First one must determine whether the claim is directed to a patent-ineligible law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea. If so, then one determines whether any additional claim elements transform the claim into a patent-eligible application that amounts to significantly more than the ineligible concept itself. Under Alice,Alice, 134 S.Ct. at 2359. Mayo, and Ultramercial, claims are patent-ineligible under ¬ß 101 if they are directed to patent-ineligible subject matter (i.e. abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural phenomena) and do not contain an inventive concept that sufficiently transforms the claim into an application of the underlying idea that restricts the claim to something significantly different from the ineligible subject matter it is directed to. This embodiment must be something more than typical operations performed on a generic computer. Following the Alice decision, several cases invalidated patents covering computer- implemented inventions as ineligible abstract ideas, including Ultramercial. Because the analyses in these decisions are somewhat ambiguous (on, e.g., defining the scope and standard of the term \\"abstract idea\\"), many inventors, bloggers, scholars, and patent lawyers have struggled with determining their full implication, especially as they relate to software claims, and some have even questioned the patentability of computer-implemented inventions in general.E.g. Timothy B. Lee, You can‚Äôt patent movies or music. So why are there software patents?, (Sept. 16, 2014) (last visited July 22, 2015); Robert Sachs, The Day the Exception Swallowed the Rule: Is Any Software Patent- Eligible After Ultramercial III?, (Dec. 2, 2014) (last visited July 22, 2015). See also Dennis Crouch, Slicing the Bologna: Judge Chen Distinguishes this Business Method from those Found Ineligible in Alice, Bilski, and Ultramercial, (Dec. 8, 2014) (last visited February 23, 2015).  Decision  Judge Chen authored the opinion of the Federal Circuit, joined by Judge Wallach, which invalidated DDR's ‚Äò572 patent as anticipated (overruling the District Court) and affirmed the District Court‚Äôs denial of NLG‚Äôs renewed motions for JMOL on invalidity and noninfringement of the ‚Äò399 patent.DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1263. The Federal Circuit Court held that the relevant claims of the ‚Äò399 patent were directed to patent eligible subject matter and that the jury was presented with substantial evidence on which to base its finding that NLG infringed the ‚Äò399 patent.DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1261. Judge Mayer authored a dissenting opinion, arguing that the ‚Äò399 patent was \\"long on obfuscation but short on substance[,]\\" and criticized the invention as \\"so rudimentary that it borders on the comical.\\" He interpreted Alice to create a \\"technological arts\\" test which DDR's claims failed because they were directed toward an entrepreneurial objective (i.e. \\"retaining control over the attention of the customer\\") rather than a technological goal.DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1258. = ¬ß 101 Analysis = The case is most significant for its discussion of 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 101 and the concept of an unpatentable abstract idea as it applies to software and business methods. In this discussion, the Federal Circuit applied the two-step test for patentability set forth in Alice to determine that DDR's '399 patent claims are directed to patent-eligible subject matter. First, it considered whether the claims were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Judge Chen does not arrive at a clear answer to this inquiry. Instead, he opts to ground his opinion in the more perceptible nature of eligibility should the analysis proceed to step two, without deciding whether that step is actually necessary.DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1256-57.  Step 1: Abstract idea?  As an initial matter, the court must determine whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent ineligible concept (e.g. an abstract idea). At this step, the court observed that distinguishing between a patentable invention and an abstract idea \\"can be difficult, as the line separating the two is not always clear.\\"DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1255. Judge Chen acknowledged that the invention could be characterized as an abstract idea, such as \\"making two e-commerce web pages look alike,\\" but also noted that the asserted claims of the ‚Äò399 patent \\"do not recite a mathematical algorithm . . . [n]or do they recite a fundamental economic or longstanding commercial practice.\\" It reviewed several Supreme Court cases useful in identifying claims directed to abstract ideas.DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1256. However, the Federal Circuit Court never offered a precise definition of an unpatentable \\"abstract idea\\" nor did it explicitly decide whether the '399 claims are directed to such ineligible subject matter. Instead, the court concludes that, even stipulating any of the characterizations of the alleged abstract idea put forth by defense counsel and the dissent, the '399 claims still contain an inventive concept sufficient to render them patent-eligible under step two of the Alice analysis.  Step 2: Inventive concept  In step two, the court must \\"consider the elements of each claim ‚Äî both individually and as an ordered combination ‚Äî to determine whether the additional elements transform the nature of the claim into a patent-eligible application of that abstract idea. This second step is the search for an ‚Äòinventive concept,‚Äô or some element or combination of elements sufficient to ensure that the claim in practice amounts to ‚Äòsignificantly more‚Äô than a patent on an ineligible concept.\\"Alice, 134 S. Ct. at 2355. In spite of the business-related nature of the claims (retaining or increasing website traffic) and the fact that they could be implemented on a generic computer, the court highlighted that the claims did not simply take an abstract business method from the pre-internet world and implement it on a computer. Instead, the claims addressed a technological problem \\"particular to the internet\\" by implementing a solution specific to that technological environment and different from the manner suggested by routine or conventional use within the field. The majority opinion characterized the problem as \\"the ephemeral nature of an Internet 'location' [and] the near-instantaneous transport between these locations made possible by standard communication protocols. The majority distinguished this problem, which they found was \\"particular to the Internet,\\" from the circumstances inherent in the \\"store within a store\\" schemes‚Äîin traditional \\"brick and mortar\\" warehouse stores with cruise vacation package kiosks, visitors to the kiosk are still inside the warehouse store when making their kiosk purchases. Judge Chen thus found that \\"the claimed solution is necessarily rooted in computer technology in order to overcome a problem specifically arising in the realm of computer networks.\\" The DDR court differentiated the claims of the ‚Äò399 patent from those that \\"merely recite the performance of some business practice known from the pre-Internet world along with the requirement to perform it on the Internet.\\" Instead, the court explained, the claims of patent ‚Äò399 \\"address the problem of retaining website visitors that, if adhering to the routine, conventional functioning of Internet hyperlink protocol, would be instantly transported away from a host's website after clicking on an advertisement and activating a hyperlink.\\" Because the invention \\"overrides the routine and conventional sequence of events ordinarily triggered by the click of a hyperlink,\\" it did not employ mere ordinary use of a computer or the Internet. Further, the court held, the claims included additional features that limit their scope to not preempt every application of any of the abstract ideas suggested by NLG. Viewed individually and as an ordered combination, the DDR court concluded that the claims these aspects of the invention established an \\"inventive concept\\" for resolving an Internet-centric problem and were therefore directed to patent-eligible subject matter. = Distinctions from patent-ineligible claims of past cases = The court found that the ‚Äò399 patent claims were significantly different from the patent-ineligible claims in Alice, Ultramercial, buySAFE, Accenture and Bancorp, in that the ‚Äò399 claims did not \\"(1) recite a commonplace business method aimed at processing business information, (2) apply a known business process to the particular technological environment of the Internet, or (3) create or alter contractual relations using generic computer functions and conventional network operations.\\"Michelle K. Holoubek & Lestin L. Kenton Jr., DDR Holdings‚ÄîA Beacon Of Hope For Software Patents, (Dec. 9, 2014) (last viewed Feb. 28, 2015). Unlike other cases recently decided under the Alice framework, the DDR court stated that the ‚Äò399 patent does not \\"broadly and generically claim use of the Internet to perform an abstract business practice (with insignificant added activity).\\" Instead, the claims \\"specify how interactions with the Internet are manipulated to yield a desired result -- a result that overrides the routine and conventional sequence of events ordinarily triggered by the click of a hyperlink.\\" The claimed system changes the normal operation of the Internet so that the visitor is directed to a \\"hybrid web page that presents product information from the third-party and visual 'look and feel' elements from the host website.\\" Thus, Judge Chen concluded that the claimed invention \\"is not merely the routine or conventional use of the Internet.\\" In Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, the court analyzed the eligibility of patent claims directed to a method for distributing copyrighted media products over the Internet where the consumer receives the content, paid for by an advertiser, in exchange for viewing an advertisement. Although the problem solved by the invention arguably was particular to the Internet, the court concluded that the steps of the claims are \\"an abstraction ‚Äì an idea, having no particular concrete or tangible form.\\" The court went on to hold that the limitations of the claims \\"do not transform the abstract idea ... into patent- eligible subject matter because the claims simply instruct the practitioner to implement the abstract idea with routine, conventional activity.\\" The Federal Circuit's DDR decision distinguished itself from Ultramercial by noting: : \\"The ‚Äô399 patent‚Äôs claims are different enough in substance from those in Ultramercial because they do not broadly and generically claim \\"use of the Internet\\" to perform an abstract business practice (with insignificant added activity). Unlike the claims in Ultramercial, the claims at issue here specify how interactions with the Internet are manipulated to yield a desired result‚Äîa result that overrides the routine and conventional sequence of events ordinarily triggered by the click of a hyperlink‚Ä¶ When the limitations of the ‚Äô399 patent‚Äôs asserted claims are taken together as an ordered combination, the claims recite an invention that is not merely the routine or conventional use of the Internet. : It is also clear that the claims at issue do not attempt to preempt every application of the idea of increasing sales by making two web pages look the same, or of any other variant suggested by NLG. Rather, they recite a specific way to automate the creation of a composite web page by an \\"outsource provider\\" that incorporates elements from multiple sources in order to solve a problem faced by websites on the Internet.\\"DDR Holdings, 773 F.3d at 1258-59. The majority also distinguished the brick-and-mortar analog to the patented invention‚Äîin-store kiosks‚Äîas \\"not hav[ing] to account for the ephemeral nature of an Internet ‚Äòlocation‚Äô or the near-instantaneous transport between these locations made possible by standard Internet communication protocols, which introduces a problem that does not arise in the ‚Äòbrick and mortar‚Äô context.\\" = Dissent = Judge Mayer in his dissent proposed a brick and mortar analog to the claimed invention where an individual shop within a larger store had the same d√©cor as the larger shop to \\"dupe\\" shopper to believing he/she was in the larger store. Hence, the claimed invention did not address a unique problem to the internet.Ron Laurie, Alice in Blunderland: The Supreme Court's Conflation of Abstractness and Obviousness, (Dec. 11, 2014) (last visited July 22, 2015); Crouch.  Significance and reception  = Commentary = Professor Crouch, in the Patently-O blog, commented: \\"The case is close enough to the line that I expect a strong push for en banc review and certiorari. Although Judge Chen‚Äôs analysis is admirable, I cannot see it standing up to Supreme Court review and, the holding here is in dreadful tension with the Federal Circuit‚Äôs recent Ultramercial decision.\\" Crouch. Gene Quinn, a patent lawyer and blogger at , doubts that this case can be reconciled with Ultramercial, despite the Federal Court's attempt to distinguish the two. Quinn found the difference between DDR and Ultramercial \\"thin\\" and one \\"that is not at all likely to lead to a repeatable and consistent test that can be applied in a predictable way.\\"Gene Quinn, Federal Circuit Finds Software Patent Claim Patent Eligible (Dec. 5, 2014) (retrieved Feb. 24, 2015). Michael Borella, a patent attorney, said in the blog: \\"Not only does this case give us another data point of how a computer-implemented invention that incorporates an abstract idea can be patent-eligible (Diamond v. Diehr is the other notable example), but it also provides the first appellate use of the second prong of the Alice test to do so.\\" Michael Borella,DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P. (Fed. Cir. 2014), (Dec. 8, 2014) (Accessed Feb. 28, 2015). = District courts = As one professorial commentator noted, \\"Because DDR Holdings is the only post-Alice Federal Circuit decision so far to uphold a patent against a ¬ß 101 challenge, patentees have been quick to cite it and accused infringers have found ways to distinguish it.\\"GW Computer Law. Among the district court cases interpreting and applying DDR Holdings are: * KomBea Corp. v. Noguar L.C., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177186 (D. Utah Dec. 23, 2014) ‚Äì \\"The patents-in-suit are distinguishable from the patents in DDR Holdings. First, the patents-in-suit are not directed toward solving a new problem, unique to a technological field. Rather, the patents-in-suit are directed toward performing fundamental commercial practices more efficiently. Second, the patents-in-suit are not a new solution to a unique problem; they only employ a combination of sales techniques and basic telemarketing technology to create an efficient system. . . . In this case, the fact that Defendant‚Äôs patents-in-suit are directed toward abstract ideas that are more efficiently executed with the use of a generic computer does not make the patents eligible for protection. Therefore, the Court finds that the claims, individually and collectively, do not transform the abstract ideas within the claims into an inventive concept. As such, the patents-in-suit fail to transform the abstract ideas they claim into patent-eligible subject matter.\\" * MyMedicalRecords, Inc. v. Walgreen Co., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176891 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 23, 2014) ‚Äì \\"Unlike the claims in DDR these claims are directed to nothing more than the performance of a long- known abstract idea 'from the pre-Internet world' ‚Äî collecting, accessing, and managing health records in a secure and private manner ‚Äî on the Internet or using a conventional computer. The patent claims are not 'rooted in computer technology in order to overcome a problem specifically arising in the realm of computer networks' [as in] DDR.

Rather, as noted above, the problem of transmitting confidential information using unsecure communication methods has existed for centuries, long before the advent of interactive television networks. . . . Here, as described more fully above in the Court's analysis of the first prong of the Alice test, the \`799 Patent does not claim a solution to a problem that arose uniquely in the context of interactive television networks. Furthermore, the \`799 Patent claims recite a method that does not go beyond the 'routine or conventional use' of existing electronic components.\\" * Messaging Gateway Solns. LLC v.

Claim 20 is directed to a problem unique to text-message telecommunication between a mobile device and a computer.

In fact, the key idea of the patent is that virus detection can take place remotely between two entities in a telephone network. This is advantageous because it saves resources on the local caller and calling machines and more efficiently executes virus detection at a centralized location in the telephone network. Claims that 'purport to improve the functioning of the computer itself' or 'effect an improvement in any other technology or technical field' may be patentable under ¬ß 101.

It is the 10th Pooch the Pup cartoon. Overview Pooch's fur is changed from white to almost entirely black. Also his trousers with a single suspender has been replaced with regular trousers and a sweater. His previous incarnation, however, will have one more go in the next cartoon. Plot summary Pooch is walking around in the forest. Though he whistles sometimes, he does not have any lines in this film. On his way, he encounters a young featherless bird that is trying to get a worm. But the worm suddenly reverses direction and swallows the bird. Pooch, who is sympathetic for the little fowl, extracts the bird from within the worm. It appears that the young bird is taking lessons from an older bird that's teaching him bird things. The older bird is teaching the young one how to fly by flapping wings. The young bird takes off from a branch, only to drop after only a few seconds. Pooch then helps out by taking feathers from a turkey, and offers them to the young bird. The young bird is able to fly properly as a result. The older bird then tells the young bird about learning to chirp before directing the student to another teacher. After attending a brief class from the other teacher, the young bird tries to chirp but to no avail. Pooch tries to help with some demonstration but the little fowl still has difficulty. Because of this, Pooch places a whistle in the young bird's esophagus. The little bird can now make some music. Meanwhile, a wild cat slowly comes to the scene. The wild cat lures the young bird using its tail disguised as a worm. The wild cat captures and runs away with its prey while Franz Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 plays. Pooch, however, sees the deed, and sends other birds to intervene. Despite receiving disruptive acts from the birds, the wild cat is able to enter a caged compound with the young bird. But the caged compound turns out to be a pound occupied by stray dogs which attack the wild cat. The little bird manages to escape. The end scene shows Pooch walking and whistling the tune of Kingdom Coming which is the opening music of some of his cartoons. The young bird joins him but coughs out the whistle Pooch gave. Pooch simply places it back.

The third-generation One was officially unveiled in a press conference at Mobile World Congress on March 1, 2015 and it was released to wide retail availability on April 10, 2015. It is the successor to HTC One (M8).  Specifications  = Hardware =  Exterior  The design of the M9 is similar to its predecessor, except that it is slightly narrower and thicker. The device has proper IPX3-level protection against spraying water. Available separately is the HTC Active Pro Case, which offers IP68-level water and dust protection, and a shockproof rating for up to a two-meter drop.  Chipsets  The phone features an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 system-on-chip with 3 GB of RAM, a 5-inch 1080p display, and 32 GB of internal storage (nearly 9 GB is reserved for the operating system). Storage can be expanded with a Micro SD card up to 2 TB.  Cameras  The UltraPixel image sensor (which had larger pixels in its sensor, but sacrificed megapixel size for enhanced low-light capabilities) was moved to the front-facing camera, with the rear-facing camera now using a more traditional 20 megapixel sensor, supporting 4K (2160p) video recording. The M8's depth sensor was also dropped. 2160p videos are limited to six minutes per recording, after which the recording would need to be restarted.Review of the HTC One M9 camera by GSMArena  Speakers  The speakers have been a prominent feature of the HTC One M series since the M7. The M9's front-facing \\"BoomSound\\" stereo speakers now use Dolby Audio tuning.  Miscellaneous  The built-in infrared (IR) sensor can make the device a remote control for other infrared- enabled gadgets. = Software = The M9 runs Android Lollipop with HTC's Sense 7 user interface and software suite. HTC updated the M9 to Android Marshmallow following its release, and subsequently updated the device to Android Nougat in December 2016 https://www.androidcentral.com/nougat-update- rolling-out-unlocked-htc-one-m9-coming-carrier-variants-early-next-year  Reception  = Pre-release = Vlad Savov from The Verge described the M9 as \\"the world‚Äôs most beautiful disappointment\\", noting that it was merely an evolution of the M8 with limited design changes, and that its rear/primary camera was of low quality, concluding that \\"remixing the past is not a sign of innovation, and neither is the addition of a fast new processor just because it‚Äôs fast and new, or multiplying the megapixels of a camera that‚Äôs still not good enough\\". Due to HTC releasing a last minute software update, Joshue Ho of AnandTech reviewed the phone in two parts. In the first part, he tested battery life, stating \\"the M9 posts a result that is a concerning regression from the M8\\" and that \\"battery life regresses around 18% when the battery is now 9% bigger.\\" He also noted temperature concerns during web browsing, stating \\"the M9 start to get warm in the hands, with skin temperatures of around 30 to 40 degrees Celsius, which is a bit concerning as I don‚Äôt recall the same being true for the M8.\\" Additionally, the phone supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 2.0, however, \\"the charger in the box is a rather conventional 5V, 1.5A adapter which doesn‚Äôt take advantage of Qualcomm‚Äôs QC 2.0 spec.\\" On battery life, he concluded that \\"the One M9 is simply less mobile than the One M8 in a significant way, which is disappointing to say the least.\\" On the display, he wrote that \\"the display has worse viewing angles than the M7 and M8.\\" As far as color accuracy, he wrote that \\"on...grayscale calibration, we can see a dramatic reduction in accuracy when compared to the M7 and M8.\\" He concluded that \\"it would be difficult to use the M9 in any case where color accuracy is needed\\" and that \\"the lack of improvement or regression in every other metric suggests that HTC has gone backwards in display quality.\\" He also observed heavy thermal throttling of the new Snapdragon 810 SOC, stating that \\"it‚Äôs basically impossible to get the A57 cluster beyond 1.5 to 1.6 GHz\\" and that \\"a single thread will eventually cause the A57 cluster to clock around 1 to 1.2 GHz.\\" = Post-release = For the second part of the AnandTech review, Ho further evaluates battery life and performance, stating that \\"simple logging shows that past the first 20 minutes the A57 cluster is either shut down or throttled to the minimum clock state\\" and that \\" the level of throttling I‚Äôve seen here is pretty much unprecedented, which doesn‚Äôt help with the issue. Overall, the performance of Snapdragon 810 here is bad enough that I would genuinely consider Snapdragon 805 to be an improvement.\\" He evaluated the speed of the camera, stating that \\"the camera preview has a relatively low frame rate and resolution\\" and that \\"the One M9 has a pretty stunning regression in autofocus speed and overall capture latency when compared to the One M8.\\" On daylight photo quality, he states that \\"HTC needs to strongly reduce the noise reduction that they're using here, as there's almost no detail in these photos\\" and on night photo quality he states that \\"the One M9 performs horribly. There's really not much else to be said because there's next to no detail in these photos.\\" As for video recording, he found that \\"the One M9 still has a noticeable lack of detail and there are a lot of problems with camera shake that aren't dampened out. It almost looks like HTC doesn't have any kind of stabilization for video here, which is rather disappointing.\\" He concluded his review, stating that \\"the One M9 is effectively a sidegrade of the One M8 at best\\" and that \\"given that the One M8 is at least 200 dollars cheaper than the One M9 on contract, I find it incredibly difficult to recommend the One M9\\". Engadget felt that the M9's speakers showed regressions over the M8, arguing that \\"the M8 usually did a better job of reproducing classic tunes than its successor. Most times, the M8 was a touch louder and shined a little more light on the primary vocal track in the mix; meanwhile, the M9 projected a soundscape that drew me in a little more thanks to cleaner channel separation, but seemed softer in comparison.\\" Similarly, the M9's camera was also found to have inconsistent performance over the M8, explaining that \\"sometimes the M9 comes through with crisper details; other times the M8 seems to do a better job. Sometimes the M9 has richer, more accurately exposed colors; sometimes it doesn't.\\" In a battery test in which a video was looped non-stop at a brightness level of 50%, the M9's result of eight hours and nineteen minutes fell in between the results of the 2013 and 2014 models. Ron Amadeo reviewed the One M9 for Ars Technica. He opened by stating that \\"[t]he Snapdragon 810 SoC‚Äîmeant to give the M9 a speed boost over the M8‚Äîhas been throttled so much that the M9 is at best equal to the M8, and in some cases slower.\\" He also noticed heavy thermal throttling, commenting that \\"[t]he 810 in the M9 was slated to run at 2GHz, but it almost never runs at that speed. It seems to be capped at 1.6 GHz.\\" The only advantage that the M9's Snapdragon 810 SoC had over the M8's Snapdragon 801 SoC was in gaming. As far as temperature, he wrote that \\"the rumors of the 810s heat issues seem based in reality\\" and that \\"HTC is butting right up against the acceptable heat level.\\" After testing the battery, he stated that \\"the battery life is poor. It only lasted six hours and 15 minutes in our test.\\" He concluded that \\"this phone stands no chance against the tougher- than-ever competition.\\" As one of the first phones released in 2015 to use the Snapdragon 810, Ars Technica noted that HTC was the least prepared of the OEMs in coping with the Snapdragon 810's overheating issues when using the initial release of that chip, missing out on later revisions of the 810 that somewhat addressed those problems. In addition, Amadeo criticized the M9's rear-facing (primary) camera for the inconsistent quality of its images compared to 2014-15 rival smartphones. The M9's rear camera module has a narrower aperture than the M7 and M8, while also lacking optical image stabilization (OIS) that was found in preceding HTC One (M7) (OIS was removed for the M8 due to the Duo Camera feature). The M9's rear camera image sensor had smaller pixels which sacrificed enhanced low-light capabilities for a higher megapixel count, compared to the M7 and M8's UltraPixel's larger sensor size and lower megapixel count. The M9's secondary/front camera for selfies with its UltraPixel sensor did perform well for its intended purpose. The M9's overall mediocre photo quality was regarded as a serious flaw, considering \\"how fundamental the camera is to the iPhone‚Äôs popularity, and any other company wishing to have a successful smartphone must start with a strong imaging foundation\\". David Ruddock reviewed the phone for Android Police. He examined the display, concluding that \\"the One M9's display has OK color reproduction...decent brightness, and pretty good viewing angles,\\" but \\"there's little denying that competitors like Samsung and Apple have surpassed HTC in the display game.\\" He described the battery life as \\"unsettlingly mediocre\\" and \\"definitely a step back from the M8.\\" He moved on to the rear/primary camera, describing it as \\"a bit of a mess on the One M9.\\" He found that \\"the focus never, ever seems right\\" and that \\"there is going to be brutal processing noise and artifacting in anything but daylight.\\" The camera launch time also regressed; \\"The launch time for the camera is also lamentable, at anywhere from 1-4 seconds depending on how the phone is feeling, I guess.\\" He concluded that \\"[t]his is the most mediocre camera fitted to a high-end smartphone in the last year, I think - it is simply not in possession of any real redeeming qualities\\" and that \\"HTC has delivered a camera that wouldn't stack up particularly well to 2014's flagships.\\" He also found evidence of thermal throttling, stating that \\"its high-speed A57 quad- core cluster, you'll never see it get over 1.5-1.6GHz in regular usage for more than sub-second bursts.\\" As for overall performance, he found that \\"it's not really even appreciable quicker than the One M8, and in some cases, I actually noticed it to be slower.\\" He concluded that \\"[t]he M9 brings nothing truly compelling to the table that the M7 and M8 before it did not.\\"  See also  * Comparison of smartphones  References   External links  * Category:Android (operating system) devices One (2015) Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2015 Category:Discontinued smartphones Category:Mobile phones with infrared transmitter Category:Mobile phones with 4K video recording ","title":"HTC One M9"},{"id":"45544526","text":"Lingua (Latin, 'tongue') may refer to: * Lingua (journal), a peer-reviewed academic journal of general linguistics * Lingua (sculpture), by Jim Sanborn * Lingua (play), a 17th-century play attributed to Thomas Tomkis * Project Lingua, an online translation community See also * Language (disambiguation) * Linga (disambiguation) * Lingga (disambiguation) * Tongue (disambiguation) * Lingua franca, a common language * Lingua.ly, an educational technology business ","title":"Lingua"},{"id":"45544549","text":"Robert Latham Jeffrey (May 3, 1934 ‚Äì September 17, 2004) was a Canadian singer, actor, director, producer and writer.\\"Jeffrey, Robert\\". Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia, January 20, 2013. He was known for his tenor range and lively interpretations for concert and musical stage.  Early life  Robert Latham Jeffrey was born on May 3, 1934 in Winnipeg‚Äôs North Kildonan neighbourhood, in Manitoba, to parents William & Nellie Jeffrey. He was the first born, later joined by two brothers; Donald and Martin. It seemed that Robert (Bob) Jeffrey had always been interested in singing. His vocal talent was appreciated at an early age when the eight-year-old Jeffrey was appointed head chorister at St. John‚Äôs Cathedral in Winnipeg. His singing led to juvenile guest spots on CBC radio‚Äôs ‚ÄúSunday School of the Air.‚Äù By the time his voice changed and he was an up-and-coming tenor, the new medium of television had come to Winnipeg. Robert became a regular on CBC variety shows broadcast from his home town.  Emerging vocal artist: the 1950s  In his late teen years he began a stage career with Winnipeg‚Äôs new Rainbow Stage summer theatre company, performing in ‚ÄúGuys and Dolls‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnnie Get Your Gun‚Äù and taking the role of Lieutenant Cable in ‚ÄúSouth Pacific‚Äù. Then in 1957 Ettore Mazzoleni heard him sing at the Manitoba Music Festival and a scholarship sent him to The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. While studying at the conservatory, Jeffrey took the tenor role in the Canadian premiere of Michael Tippett‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Child of Our Time‚Äù, under Mazzoleni‚Äôs direction, at the University of Toronto‚Äôs Convocation Hall. He also undertook classical repertoire with choirs throughout Ontario, including the tenor roles in Handel‚Äôs ‚ÄúMessiah‚Äù and Mendelssohn‚Äôs ‚ÄúElija‚Äù, in Sudbury. In 1958 he won the Kiwanis Music Festival Award in the ‚ÄòMale Lieder‚Äô category, for a performance at Eaton Auditorium. In the late 1960s, he was cantor at St. Thomas's Anglican Church (Toronto), under the direction of Walter MacNutt. At this time he also researched a CBC radio programme on religious music, under the direction of Brian Freeland. Jeffrey‚Äôs last appearance on the concert stage was in a 1994 production of ‚ÄúAmahl and the Night Visitors‚Äù for music director Lloyd Bradshaw at St. Anne's Anglican Church in Toronto.  1960s and 70s: international stage  In 1960 he was invited to join the Stratford Shakespeare Festival production of ‚ÄúH.M.S. Pinafore‚Äù, under the direction of Sir Tyrone Guthrie, as chorus and understudy to the leading role. Guthrie recognized an emerging acting presence and encouraged the singer‚Äôs interest in the musical stage. Pinafore was a great success in Stratford and was transferred to New York for a limited engagement at the Phoenix Theatre. Jeffrey was back in Stratford in 1961 for the Guthrie production of ‚ÄúPirates of Penzance‚Äù. This was another success with a return to New York and a three- month U.S. tour. These U.S. visits exposed the singer to American audiences. Mr. Jeffrey was highlighted during the Pinafore run at New York‚Äôs Phoenix Theatre as ‚ÄòOne to Watch‚Äô in Dan Blum‚Äôs noted ‚ÄúTheatre World‚Äù publication. ‚ÄúH.M.S. Pinafore‚Äù then went on to London in 1962 for a Command Performance before Queen Elizabeth II at Her Majesty‚Äôs Theatre. While in the British capital, Robert Jeffrey was offered the role of Tony in H. M. Tennent‚Äôs Scandinavian tour of ‚ÄúWest Side Story‚Äù. He replaced David Holliday in Copenhagen and went on to plaudits, opposite Jill Martin as Maria, in Oslo, Goteborg, Stockholm and Helsinki. In 1963, back in London, he appeared in the new musical ‚ÄúHouse of Cards‚Äù, at the Players' Theatre. Returning to Toronto in 1964, he appeared as Mr. Ringo in one of the early productions of Susan Douglas Rube≈°‚Äô Young People's Theatre, ‚ÄúThe Dandy Lion‚Äù. This was his second stage appearance in the city. He had previously starred in a new Bernard Slade musical ‚ÄúThe Gay Chaperone‚Äù (The Duenna) at Toronto‚Äôs Crest Theatre in January 1961. In 1968 Jeffrey joined a roster of Canadian musical comedy stars (including Jack Creley and Rita Howell) in the annual touring revue ‚ÄúSpring Thaw,‚Äù established him as a stage presence across the country for the next three years (1968, 69, 70). These tours led to a return to Winnipeg‚Äôs Rainbow Stage for two seasons, in ‚ÄúFinian's Rainbow‚Äù (1964) with Burt Wheeler and ‚ÄúMame‚Äù (1972), in the role of Patrick Dennis, with Libby Morris. In the summer of 1968 Jeffrey landed a role in the Toronto production of ‚ÄúYour Own Thing‚Äù at the Bayview Playhouse. In November he was back on that stage as one of the quartet of performers for the Canadian premiere of ‚ÄúJacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris‚Äù (with Stan Porter, Arlene Meadows and Loro Farrell). The successful run of this production led to an invitation to open in the show in Boston with Arlene Meadows, Robert Guillaume and Judy Lander, at the Charles Playhouse. Jeffrey remained in Boston for two years, joined in the Brel show by such artists as Denise LeBrun, Sally Cooke, George Ball and Shawn Elliott. He went on to join productions in Montreal (at Place des Arts), Ottawa (in the recently opened National Arts Centre) and Philadelphia (with Elly Stone), with a return to Boston in 1981. In 1972 he joined the large cast of Brel interpreters in a Carnegie Hall fifth anniversary presentation of the hit show, a ‚ÄúHomage a Jacques‚Äù, with the celebrated Jacques Brel in attendance. On his return to Toronto from Boston in 1973, Jeffrey continued in the world of cabaret inspired by the Brel show. ‚ÄúOf Moon & June & Honeymoon,‚Äù a song revue which Jeffrey co-devised with director Ron Ror, set to music by Doug Randle, opened at Old Angelo‚Äôs cabaret on Elm Street with a cast of Christine Chandler, Brian McKay and Barbara Barsky. The show was re-packaged for Cleveland in August and opened Hamilton‚Äôs new Hamilton Place Theatre in September. At the end of the Toronto run, artistic director Michael Ayoub saw the show and invited the production to open his Muskoka Festival (re-staged by Bernard Hiatt), based in Gravenhurst, Ontario, that summer. His arrival in Muskoka in 1973 led to a long-term affiliation with that company which included roles in Muskoka Festival productions of ‚ÄúDames at Sea‚Äù, ‚ÄúFlicks‚Äù, ‚ÄúI Do! I Do!‚Äù(1974) with Jamie Ray, ‚ÄúFlicks‚Äù and ‚ÄúEight to the Bar‚Äù (1979) with Nancy Palk. In 1983 he directed Michael Burgess and Kate Hennig in ‚ÄúSide by Side by Sondheim‚Äù. In 1984 he co-directed (with Paul Russell) a workshop production of a new Adamo and O‚ÄôDonnell musical, ‚ÄúRobin For Good‚Äù. The following year saw a fully staged production with Marianne Woods, Jonathan Whittaker and James Fagan Tait. In 1972 he played Sancho Panza in Heinar Piller‚Äôs Grand Theatre (London, Ontario) production of ‚ÄúMan of La Mancha‚Äù(with Michael Fletcher and Denise Ferguson). He also directed a production of ‚ÄúJacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris‚Äù for The Playhouse (Fredericton). This led to directing (and performing in) another revival of the show for Marlene Smith and Strut Productions, at the Teller‚Äôs Cage in Toronto (1975). The 1970s were the years of cabaret in Toronto, and across Canada. Jeffrey was booked solid. After ‚ÄúMoon & June‚Äù in Toronto, he was invited to be part of Roderick Cook ‚ÄúOne More Time‚Äù(1974) with Connie Martin and David Brown at the Colonial Tavern. This was followed by ‚ÄúIn Gay Company‚Äù with Susan Keller at the Teller‚Äôs Cage (1975). In 1976 Jeffrey appeared in David Y.H. Lui‚Äôs Vancouver production of Ben Bagley's ‚ÄúThe Decline and Fall of the Entire World as Seen through the Eyes of Cole Porter‚Äù with Ross Petty and Roma Hearn. Back in Toronto in 1977 he directed and appeared in another revival of ‚ÄúJacques Brel,‚Äù with Barbara Collier, Nora McClellan and Rudy Webb, at the Bayview Playhouse. This production continued with an extended run at the city‚Äôs Prince Hotel followed by performances at the Sly Fox Cabaret in Ottawa. In 1980 he directed ‚ÄúTo Eternity through Noise & Smoke‚Äù for Magda Zalan‚Äôs Podium Productions, which featured Nancy Palk, Sean Hewitt, Marcia Tratt and Joe Zeigler, at Toronto‚Äôs St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts. In 1979 Tony Lloyd, artistic director of Theatre Sudbury invited Jeffrey to direct Peter Mews, Marylu Moyer and Pam Hyatt in ‚ÄúAnne of Green Gables: The Musical‚Äù(1980). He had previously appeared in Sudbury in classical concerts and as Mack the Knife in ‚ÄúThe Threepenny Opera‚Äù (1972) and was delighted to return. This directorial project was followed by Theatre Sudbury roles in 1982 productions of ‚ÄúOliver!‚Äù (Mr. Bumble) and ‚ÄúThe Sound of Music‚Äù (Max). This was followed in 1983 with the title role in ‚ÄúYou're a Good Man, Charlie Brown‚Äù, with Grant Cowan and Marcia Tratt. In 1984 he appeared in ‚ÄúFlicks‚Äù and in 1986 he was Captain Andy in ‚ÄúShow Boat‚Äù. In the early eighties, he also returned to productions for Toronto‚Äôs Young Peoples Theatre, where he had earlier success in ‚ÄúThe Dandy Lion.‚Äù He played a lively Tigger in 1973‚Äôs ‚ÄúWinnie the Pooh‚Äù with Don Francks as Pooh, at the St. Lawrence Centre. In 1980 he was offered the title role in ‚ÄúThe Popcorn Man‚Äù and in the next year returned for ‚ÄúThe Threepenny Opera‚Äù with Salome Bey (1981). These last two productions were at Young People's Theatre's new venue on Toronto‚Äôs Front Street. Mr. Jeffrey‚Äôs last stage appearance was in the Ontario Tour of Walter Learning and Alden Nowlan‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Gift to Last‚Äù (1991).  Television  Robert Jeffrey had been introduced to television in the 1950s in Winnipeg, as soon as the Winnipeg studios of CBC opened. After 1958, during his Toronto studies, he appeared on CBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúHit Parade‚Äù, with Robert Goulet and Giselle Mackenzie, recorded at the CBC Jarvis Street studios. Both of Guthrie‚Äôs Gilbert and Sullivan productions for Stratford Festival had been adapted for television by Norman Campbell, in 1960 and 61. When Jeffrey returned from Europe in 1964, he was interviewed by Fred Rogers for his new CBC children‚Äôs show and made appearances on the new ‚ÄúMister Rogers' Neighborhood‚Äù. He followed this with guest spots on ‚ÄúButternut Square‚Äù and then on Ernie Coombs‚Äô ‚ÄúMr. Dressup.‚Äù In 1972 he was invited to appear on several episodes of TVOntario's ‚ÄúPolka Dot Door.‚Äù He was frequently cast on variety shows such as ‚ÄúMusic Album‚Äù and there were several appearances on Elwood Glover's Luncheon Date during the 1970s. In 1979 he undertook the title role of Dodi Robb and Pat Patterson‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Popcorn Man‚Äù in a CBC children‚Äôs music special. This led to repeating the role on stage.  Later years and legacy  In his later years, passing the spotlight to the next generation, Robert Jeffrey joined with Sandy Stewart (producer), Pat Stewart and Paul G. Russell (1985) to adapt the classic television quiz show Reach for the Top for in-school play as ‚ÄúSchoolreach.‚Äù Reach for the Top had launched the career of Jeopardy!'s Alex Trebek years before. Reach was privately produced by Sandy Stewart from 1985 to 1996. In 1996, Jeffrey and Russell, as Paulus Productions Inc., acquired Reach for the Top. In the year 2000, they re-established ‚ÄúReach‚Äù on television, first with Canadian Learning Television, then with Access TV (now CTV Two Alberta), Knowledge Network and TVOntario. The Reach Organization (Reach for the Top and Schoolreach) continues to sponsor student co-curricular play in the format made popular on television, across Canada. To honour the 50th anniversary of the National Finals of Reach for the Top (2016), the estate of Robert Jeffrey contributed to the establishment of the Reach for the Top Foundation, offering cash awards to celebrate student achievement. In the 1990s, Robert Jeffrey, through Paulus Productions Inc., was a founding member of PFG (the Paulus Film Group), which nurtured a younger generation of Canadian filmmakers whose output included feature films and award-winning videos for broadcast on the Bravo (Canada) network. Besides Jeffrey, PFG was made up of Daniel Hill, Robert Crossman, Drew Mullin, David Greene, Aaron Woodley and Paul G. Russell. Robert Jeffrey served as executive producer on a number of these projects and was often cast in cameo roles by the directors. Several PFG films, such as ‚ÄúBed & Breakfast,‚Äù won recognition at film festivals in Atlanta, Columbus, Houston, Los Angeles, Palm Springs, Chicago and Toronto. Robert died of heart failure at his home in Toronto, on September 17, 2004. His archive is at the University of Guelph.

Skarpenberg - Sveistrup The convent was inaugurated the following year. It functioned as a convent for unmarried women from noble or princely houses, who resided at Vall√∏ Castle. For this purpose, Vall√∏ Castle was expanded between 1736-38 with a new baroque-style building designed by architect Lauritz de Thurah (1706‚Äì1759). Until 1810, the convent was headed by an abbess, who were to be of a princely house. Initially the abbess was Sophie Caroline of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (1705‚Äì1764) who was a younger sister of Queen Sophie Magdalene. The abbess had the right to appoint the vicars in the parishes belonging to the county of the stift. She was assisted by a prioress with the title dekanesse. In 1810 the office of abbey was abolished, and the dean became head of the foundation. The activities of the foundation changed after the end of World War II. In 1976, the foundation's bylaws were revised so that no more new ladies of the diocese were to be enrolled, but noble widows who were already registered could get free housing in the castle.

It peaked at number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. Though usually stylised as one word, the title has also appeared as two separate words (for example, on the compilation album Antics in the Forbidden Zone). \\"Cartrouble (Parts 1 & 2)\\" \\"Cartrouble\\" differs from \\"Cartrouble (Parts 1 & 2)\\" from Adam and the Ants' debut album Dirk Wears White Sox, also on Do It Records. \\"Cartrouble\\" is essentially a re-arranged and re-recorded version of the ‚Äú‚Ä¶(Part 2)\\" alone. It has a heavier but commercially polished sound, making it far more radio-friendly than the original. \\"Cartrouble (Parts 1 & 2)\\" features Matthew Ashman on guitar, Dave Barbarossa on drums and Andy Warren on bass guitar. A remix of this version appeared on the 12-inch edition of The Antmusic EP in early 1982. This replaced the original on the 1995 CD release of Dirk Wears White Sox. The 2004 reissue of the same album includes all three versions, with the original returning as track 1. \\"Cartrouble\\" was re-recorded with a different line-up of Ants in order to fulfill a contractual obligation. Adam's ever changing line-up of Ants on the single include his future songwriting partner Marco Pirroni on guitar, bass guitar and backing vocals, and Terry 1 & 2 on drums. Terry 1 & 2 is a pseudonym for Jon Moss who went on to superstardom years later as a member of Culture Club. The song also marks the first time Adam and Pirroni worked together. Music videos of \\"Cartrouble Part 2\\" and another album track, \\"Tabletalk\\" were filmed in November 1979 as audition footage for Malcolm McLaren. These were directed by Stephanie Gluck and Clive Richardson and filmed in Richardson's back garden. \\"Kick!\\" This alternative line-up of Ants is also featured on the B-side \\"Kick!\\", with a double-track recording of Moss resulting one of the first two- drummer Burundi beat recordings for which the band became famous. The lyrics are completely different from the version of \\"Kick\\" that appears on the Antmusic EP Do It releases in 1982. American version of Dirk Wears White Sox The single version was used in place of \\"Cartrouble (Parts 1 & 2)\\" on the CBS Epic Records version of Dirk Wears White Sox that was released in America in 1983. \\"Kick!\\" was also added, while \\"Day I Met God\\" and \\"Catholic Day\\" were dropped.

The foundation was made upon the suggestion of Carl Wilhelm Cederhielm in 1739. The original purpose was the foundation of a Protestant convent for unmarried female members of the nobility at Vadstena Castle. It was to be both a school for girls from the nobility, as well as a home for poor noblewomen who were unable to support themselves. This idea was never realized because of the costs. However, from 1747 onward, it started to accept members, which were given the title stiftsfr√∂ken and received an allowance from the foundation, though they never lived at the Vadstena Castle. In 1758, it was formally transformed into a fund for the support of unmarried female members of the nobility, who also used the title stiftsfr√∂ken. Though Vadstena adliga jungfrustift never functioned as a stift, the Norrk√∂ping jungfrustift, formally a branch of the Vadstena adliga jungfrustift, did function as a stift in Norrk√∂ping from 1783-1796.

The Specialty Food Association's annual \\"State of the Specialty Food Industry 2014\\" report stated that in 2013 in the U.S., specialty foods and beverages sales totaled $88.3 billion, accounted for an increase of 18.4% since 2011, and was a record high for the fourth consecutive year. The report also stated that around 80% of specialty food sales occur at the retail level, and that seven out of ten specialty food retailers reported that the word \\"local\\" had the most importance as a product claim. Bean-to-bar chocolate manufacturers As of March 2015 in the United States, the number of bean- to-bar chocolate manufacturers (companies that process cocoa beans into a product in-house, rather than melting chocolate from another manufacturer) had increased to at least 60. The Fine Chocolate Industry Association (FCIA) stated that this represented \\"a tenfold increase in the past decade that's outpacing growth in Europe\\". In April 2020, the FCIA launched the campaign website Make Mine Fine in order to support small scale farmers who rely on cocoa for their livelihoods in tropical countries and highlight the work of chocolate manufacturers who buy their beans. California In 2012 in the United States, the specialty foods market sector was experiencing significant growth, with its annual growth rate at 8‚Äì10%. In 2010, specialty foods comprised 13.1% of total retail food sales and totaled $55.9 billion in sales. In 2010 in Oakland, California it was reported that abandoned industrial spaces previously occupied by large food producers were being inhabited by small specialty food companies. In 1998, the U.S. state of California had the second-highest amount of specialty and gourmet foods of all U.S. states. This has been attributed as possible due a diverse variety of unique fruits and vegetables that can be grown in Southern California. Another possibility for the high quantity and diversity of specialty foods in California is that food innovations often occur in the state, as has occurred in other sectors such as health food and organic produce. In 1991, the Los Angeles Times reported that city officials in Monterey Park, Los Angeles County, California, suspected that significant numbers of non-residents were visiting the city to shop at Asian markets there to obtain specialty foods. Vermont In terms of food-place association perceptions, Vermont has been described as being associated with \\"homemade-style specialty items\\", along with maple syrup.

Charles and Mary Ann Jarvis Homestead is a historic house at 10 Surry Road in Ellsworth, Maine. Built in 1828, the house is architecturally significant as a fine example of transitional Federal-Greek Revival styling, based in part on the publications of Asher Benjamin. It is historically notable for its association with Charles Jarvis, a major landowner in the region. Jarvis was also an active participant in the military preparations of the bloodless Aroostook War, resulting from a long-running boundary dispute with neighboring New Brunswick. Jarvis' daughter, Ann Francis Greely, was also Hancock County's first female doctor, and a local activist for women's rights and temperance. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description The Jarvis House is set on the southeast side of Surry Road (Maine State Route 172), a short way south of its junction with United States Route 1, just west of Ellsworth's central business district. Its main block is a roughly square wood frame structure, with a hip roof that is topped by a flat balustraded area at its center. A single-story hip-roof porch extends around three sides of this block, and a two-story gable-roof ell extends to the east side of the main block, with a further single-story addition at its end. The porch is supported by Tuscan columns, and has a modillioned cornice. The interior of the house follows a central hall plan. Its major public space is to the left of the hall, and consists of a large double parlor with sliding doors at its center. Design of this room is clearly drawn from Plate LIV of Asher Benjamin's American Builder's Companion. The dining room, to the right of the hall, is more richly detailed in its woodwork. The kitchen, located behind the dining room, has had a number of later alterations, including a butler's pantry and a German silver sink. History The house was built in 1828 by a builder from Castine. A number of its exterior features, including the wraparound porch, are Colonial Revival alterations made around the turn of the 20th century. The balustrade that is now atop the roof is not original. A carriage house, built c. 1914, replaced an older New England barn on the property. Charles Jarvis (1788-1865) came to Maine around 1818 to manage extensive lands that his father had acquired, and was elected to the state legislature. Jarvis was in competition with John Black (whose nearby mansion is now a museum property), the land agent for William Bingham, the area's largest landowner. Jarvis married Black's daughter Ann (over initial objections from her father) in 1820. Competition between the two men extended to disputes over the municipal boundaries of Ellsworth and Surry; Jarvis' house was located in Surry when it was built. When border tensions with neighboring New Brunswick flared in the 1830s, Jarvis is reported to have built the military road connecting Mattawamkeag and Houlton, the latter being a major staging point for the state militia that was organized because of the dispute. In 1839 Jarvis, commissioned a colonel in the state militia, led troops up to the mouth of the Aroostook River. The border dispute was resolved peacefully with the 1842 Webster-Ashburton Treaty. Jarvis' daughter Ann was born here in 1831, and became one Hancock County's first and most successful businesswomen. At twenty she purchased a local dry goods store, and in 1895 she was specially authorized by the state legislature to practice medicine. She was also well known as a supporter of temperance, and of women's right to vote. It was during her ownership of the house that the butler's pantry, silver sink, dumbwaiter, and electric call buttons were installed in the house. A later owner of the house was Hannibal Emery Hamlin, the son of United States Vice President Hannibal Hamlin. He served as Maine Attorney General 1905-1908, and also in the state legislature.

Philosophy and feminism  Valc√°rcel‚Äôs academic life has been mainly devoted to two academic fields: philosophy and feminist studies. Within the subject area of Feminist Philosophy, Valc√°rcel is considered to be part of the equality feminism approach. Her most distinctive contribution to the field of feminist thinking has been to place feminism within the canonic history of political philosophy, especially in her monograph Feminismo en el mundo global (2008). She has written several manuscripts, some of them translated into other languages. Her theoretical thinking is close to that of the equally well-known Spanish philosophers Celia Amor√≥s and Victoria Camps. Valc√°rcel takes the philosophical position that the nexus between women is not the nature or essence of themselves, opposite to the difference feminism arguments, it is however the patriarchal and hetero-designation, the role which patriarchal assigns to women (mother, daughter, espouse and prostitute‚Ä¶) and especially the role women occupy in society which has been depicted by men. Likewise, the role and common denominator that all women share is their functional status (submission) different from men.

Forming as a modernist breakaway party from former Islamist movements, the AKP's conservative democratic ideology has been described as a departure from or moderation of Islamic democracy and the endorsement of more secular and democratic values. The electoral success and the Neo-Ottoman foreign policy of the AKP that aims to broaden Turkey's regional influence has led to the party's conservative democratic ideals to be mirrored in other countries, such as by the Justice and Development Party in Morocco and the Ennahda Movement in Tunisia. In its broadest sense, the term 'conservative democracy' highlights the compatibility of Islam with democracy, a western-oriented foreign policy, neoliberal economics and secularism within government.http://pbilgin.bilkent.edu.tr/NPT%2040,%20Pinar%20Bilgin.pdf Since the view has been reflected in several economic, foreign, domestic and social policy initiatives, the term 'conservative democracy' has been referred to as a floating signifier that encompasses a broad coalition of ideas.https://archive.today/20150301221218/http://www.academia.edu/7305673/AKP_s_Conservative_Democracy_as_an_Empty_Signifier_in_Turkish_Politics_Shifts_and_Challenges_after_2002 In contrast and because of its broad definition, the term has also been accused of being a red herring designed to conceal a hidden Islamist agenda but maintain public support. The main ideals of conservative democracy are best identified when they are compared to the Islamist ideology advocated by the AKP's preceding parties. A substantial contrast between the two exist, for example, on their position regarding the European Union, Israel, the United States, economic policy and, to a lesser extent, social policy. Political development Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, who coined the term 'conservative democracy' The AKP was formed in 2001 after moderate politicians abandoned the Islamist Virtue Party in order to establish a modernist political party instead. These included the former Mayor of Istanbul, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and Kayseri MP Abdullah G√ºl. Earning the support of many members from the Virtue Party, the AKP also took away much of the support from other centre-right economically liberal parties such as the True Path Party and the Motherland Party in the 2002 general election. The party has thus been described as a \\"broad right-wing coalition of Islamists, reformist Islamists, conservatives, nationalists, centre-right, and pro-business groups.http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/opeds/Cagaptay20140507-Janes.pdf Since secularism is enshrined in the constitution of Turkey, various openly Islamist political parties, such as the National Order Party, the National Salvation Party, the Welfare Party and eventually the Virtue Party were closed down by the Constitutional Court for anti-secular activities. That contributed to the subsequent abandonment of an openly Islamist ideology in favour of a reformed, pro-secular conservative democratic ideal that would be accepted by the state. A closure case against the AKP in 2008 on the grounds that the party violated secularism thereby failed, but the party was stripped of 50% of its state funding. =Hidden agenda= The term 'conservative democracy' has seldom been defined by AKP politicians. The party's origins from Islamist organisations has raised speculation as to whether the party in fact harbours a hidden Islamist political agenda and uses the term 'conservative democracy' to conceal such intentions. Members of the opposition Republican people's Party (CHP) and opposition journalists have put forward the view that the party has gradually brought about Islamist-oriented social changes, such as limiting alcohol consumption as well as beginning a crackdown against mixed- sex student accommodation in late 2013. Other reforms, such as the lifting of the headscarf ban in the civil service, have been labelled as human rights issues by supporters and as open attacks on secularism by rivals. A substantial rise in electoral fraud allegations during the AKP government, most prevalently during the 2014 local elections, as well as numerous government corruption scandals, has raised speculation that the AKP harbours not an Islamist but an authoritarian hidden agenda, which aims to a gradual eliminatation of democratic checks and balances. Judicial reforms by the government in 2014 that were criticised as an attempt to politicise the courts, a heavy-handed police crackdown following anti-government protests in 2013 and increasing media censorship have also furthered that claim. Values Former minister H√ºseyin √áelik claimed the AKP's conservative democracy as being limited to social and moral issues, rejecting the 'moderate Islam' and the 'Muslim democrat' labels, which have been used to describe the party. Although politicians who have identified themselves as conservative democrats have usually endorsed secularism, disputes have long remained between them and hardline laicists, who advocate a ban on religious activities in the public sphere. Gradualism =Alcohol= The high tax on the alcoholic beverages, called special consumption tax ( √ñTV), established first in 2002 and dramatically increased in 2010 by the government of Justice and Development Party (AKP), whose leadership is known for their aversion to alcohol, led to a significant rise in smuggling and fraud involving the alcoholic beverages in the country. Bootlegging is blamed for the 2011 Turkish Riviera mass alcohol poisoning. In 2013, new laws banned all forms of advertising and promotion for alcoholic beverages, including \\"promotions, sponsored activities, festivals and free giveaways.\\"Hurriyet Daily News, 24 May 2013, Turkish Parliament adopts alcohol restrictions, bans sale between 10 pm and 6 am Beverage companies ran ads criticising the ban.Bloomberg, 12 June 2013, Diageo Facing Raki Trouble in Turkey After Booze-Ad Banadage.com 1 June 2013, Alcohol Marketers Say Farewell to Ads In Turkey--With Ads In 2013 the government passed laws limiting retail licenses from 10 pm to 6 amConstanze Letsch, The Guardian, 31 May 2013, Turkey alcohol laws could pull the plug on Istanbul nightlife and banning \\"student dormitories, health institutions, sports clubs, all sorts of education institutions and gas stations\\" from selling alcohol. 185,000 kiosks with alcohol licenses could be affected. The law also included a requirement to blur depictions of alcoholic beverages on television and in films, as was already done for cigarettes, and for bottles to carry health warnings similar to tobacco packaging warning messages. =Headscarf= In 2013, the headscarf ban in public institutions was lifted through a decree, even though the ban officially stands through court decisions.Euronews (08.10.2013) The headscarf ban in public institutions in Turkey was officially lifted The ban on wearing hijab in high schools was lifted in 2014. =Adultery= In 2018, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said that Turkey should again consider criminalizing adultery and that Turkey made a mistake by not criminalizing adultery to join EU in 2004.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-adultery/turkey-should-again- consider-criminalizing-adultery-erdogan-says- idUSKCN1G42BUhttp://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-made-a-mistake-by-not- criminalizing-adultery-to-join-eu-erdogan-127642 Criticism Besides the accusations of being a red herring, the term 'conservative democracy' has come under fire from a founding AKP politician, Ertuƒürul Yal√ßƒ±nbayƒ±r, who claimed that the AKP's party programme was nor initially written on a conservative democratic basis but instead focussed simply on protecting democracy. He argued that by identifying itself as conservative democrat, the AKP has pressured the electorate into endorsing conservative values, which has been detrimental to social unity and freedom of thought. He argued that the term 'conservative democrat' was, in fact, coined by Deputy Prime Minister Yal√ßƒ±n Akdoƒüan, in a book entitled 'AK Party and Conservative Democracy' in 2004. Yal√ßƒ±nbayƒ±r also claimed that disagreements over the term contributed to another Deputy Prime Minister Abd√ºllatif ≈ûener leaving the AKP and establish the Turkey Party in 2009.

It is very steep-sided and was not opened to tourists until 2006. To do this a 1.4 million euro, EU-supported, Austro-German project was undertaken to build steel walkways and bridges over a distance of 970 metres. With a total length of 1,650 metres it is the longest accessible gorge in the Eastern Limestone Alps. The gorge was opened on 24 May 2006.  Marketing  As a tourist project the gorge was marketed as the so-called Geisterklamm (\\"Spirit Gorge\\"), in conjunction with the Koboldpfad (\\"Kobold Path\\") as a family-friendly leisure paradise. There are 40 boards with information on myths, geology, flora and fauna in the surround area, as well as a spirit with winking eyes and coloured, sound-oriented games. The walkways are horizontal wherever possible and are built so that they can be negotiated without climbing equipment. Any anxiety caused by due height difference of more than 50 metres in places between the walkway the floor of the gorge is supposed to be counteracted by the solid design of the walkway. In addition there is a short path to a waterfall in the gorge. The Leutasch Gorge is basically open all year round except when there are heavy snowfalls when it is closed. The walk through the gorge is free; only the path to the waterfall has a charge.

It functioned as a Stift or Protestant convent for unmarried female nobles from 1783 to 1796, situated in the city of Norrk√∂ping. Though formally a branch of the Vadstena adliga jungfrustift, it was in fact the only stift active in Sweden. In 1783, riksr√•d Carl Fredrik Scheffer decided to meet the complaints about the fact that the foundation Vadstena adliga jungfrustift, despite repeated attempts, had never managed to form any actual establishment of a Protestant convent, as had originally been the purpose. That year, he bought a house in the city in Norrk√∂ping and donated it to the Vadstena adliga jungfrustift comity, who decided to open a local branch of the convent there. Though called a local branch of the \\"mother convent\\", it was in fact the only functioning stift in Sweden, as the Vadstena adliga jungfrustift continued to function only as a foundation. The Norrk√∂ping jungfrustift consisted of an abbess (though referred to as prioress) and six unmarried noblewomen with the title stiftsjungfru or stiftsfr√∂ken. Except for the actual members of the convent, the establishment functioned as house for various female paying guests. The abbesses were the noble widows Sofia Emerentia Gyllenborg (in 1783-83) and Hedvig Christina Creutz (in 1783-96). The stift was dissolved by the foundation because of its bad economy in 1796, but the abbess and the other members were given a pension from the foundation.

In the widespread outcry following Ferrer's execution in 1909 and the international movement that sprung in its wake, a group of New York anarchists convened as the Ferrer Association in 1910. Their headquarters, the Ferrer Center, hosted a variety of cultural events in the avant-garde arts and radical politics, including lectures, discussions, and performances. It was also home to the Ferrer Modern School, a libertarian, day school that emphasized unplanned, undogmatic curriculum. The Center moved several times throughout Manhattan to establish a space conducive to children's play. Following a bomb plot and police infiltration, several anarchists from the association decided to take the school out to the country. The school moved to what would become the Ferrer Colony in Stelton, New Jersey, 30 miles outside New York City, in 1914. The colony was based around the school and land was individually parceled such that, in the spirit of anarchist volunteerism, anyone could sell and exit the colony at their prerogative. They intended for the colony to form the center of a national libertarian education movement. The school floundered in its first years and passed through multiple administrations, the longest of which with co-principals Elizabeth and Alexis Ferm. The school closed in 1953. It had been a model for short-lived Ferrer schools across the country and lasted among the longest.  Ferrer Center  Francisco Ferrer, whom the project was named after In 1909, the free-thinker, pedagogue, and anarchist Francisco Ferrer was executed in Barcelona and subsequently propelled into martyrdom. The resulting Ferrer movement led to the founding of anticlerical private schools in the model of his Escuela Moderna throughout the world. One such school was founded in New York. On June 12, 1910, a group of 22 anarchists and sympathizers began the Francisco Ferrer Association in New York City. Together they built a \\"cultural center and evening school\\", which expanded into an \\"experimental day school\\" and, ultimately, a colony outside New Brunswick, New Jersey. The association lasted over 40 years and had three goals: to promote Ferrer's writings, to organize meetings on the anniversary of his death, and to establish schools by his model throughout the United States. Outside the United States, the Americans had no explicit connection with international Ferrer groups. The Association's headquarters, the Ferrer Center, hosted a variety of cultural events: literary lectures, debates on current affairs, avant-garde arts and performance, social dances, and classes for the inquisitive masses. And when the Center crossed genres, its spirit of experimentalism was unpretentious. Though many of its teachers were hostile to formal academic manner, classes addressed standard subjects. Some were taught by distinguished individuals: painters Robert Henri and George Bellows taught figure drawing, Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen's son taught comparative literature, Robert La Follette's law partner taught government, and Will Durant taught the history of philosophy. The Center held an evening English class, whose topics often included proletarian history and current affairs. One group studied Esperanto. Lectures discussed free thought, religion, sex, and hygiene. Margaret Sanger proposed mothers' meetings on birth control. On the weekends, the Center hosted speakers for discussion including journalist Hutchins Hapgood, poet Edwin Markham, and reporter Lincoln Steffens. A lecture by lawyer Clarence Darrow attracted hundreds. Others associated with the Center included Max Weber, Jack London, Upton Sinclair, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. The folklorist Moritz Jagendorf started a \\"Free Theatre\\" at the Center in late 1914. The group performed new manuscripts, including a world premiere of a Lord Dunsany drama, as well as their own original plays, which had social themes. The theater had a very limited budget and some of its performers struggled to speak English. They also hosted Floyd Dell's troupe and others from Greenwich Village. The Center had an air of radical affability and cosmopolitanism. Historian Laurence Veysey described the Center, with its unrestricted discussions on social subjects and wide representation of nationalities, as potentially the country's least inhibited and most stimulating small venue at the time. The Center's radical politics made it a haven for anti-capitalist revolutionaries, anarchists, and libertarians. It hosted children from the 1912 Lawrence textile strike, supported Frank Tannenbaum's 1914 mobilization of the unemployed, and fed protesters. The Center's formation coincided with a resurgence of interest in radical politics: the rise of syndicalism, multiple revolutions (including Russia), and strike actions. While assimilation had eroded immigrant interest in radical politics for several decades, with this optimistic turn, anarchism had begun to escape the stigma of the 1901 McKinley assassination. By 1914, the Center's adult membership was in the hundreds and Jewish people formed the largest contingent of its many represented nationalities. The social foundation of the New York Ferrer movement was the relationship between Jewish immigrants, who valued education, and domestic Americans, who approached teaching with alacrity. The Association and Modern School leaders were mostly domestic Americans. Among the early leaders, only Joseph J. Cohen was an immigrant, and he arrived three years after the Center's founding. The rest were not immigrants: the early spokesperson and first Association president Leonard Abbott, Harry Kelly, and early financier Alden Freeman. Journalist Hutchins Hapgood, who lectured at the Center, came to write about Yiddish culture following his interactions there. Gallerist Carl Zigrosser wrote of the Center expanding his understanding of New York society beyond the knowledge he had received from books. Several anarchists from the association decided to take the school out to the country. The Center served as a model for schools across the United States in Chicago, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. But while these schools mostly closed within several years, the schools in Stelton and Mohegan would last for decades. = New York Modern School = As was originally intended, the Ferrer Association established a day school for children within the Ferrer Center in October 1911. In practice, the New York Ferrer Modern School was based less on Ferrer's method than his memory. The New York school's founders were propelled by their sense of injustice at Ferrer's execution and their belief in the liberatory prospect of his approach, but they made no concerted effort to replicate his example. The American movement for progressive education was a more likely influence on the New York founders' interest in starting a school, as was the importance put upon education in Jewish culture. New York anarchists believed in the liberatory role of the school partly because, as European anarchist √©migr√©s, they believed in the power of ideas to change the future and wanted their children to share their values. The school's early character was unplanned and undogmatic. The Association sought \\"the reconstruction of society upon the basis of freedom and justice\\" and accordingly, the founders wanted their school to let children develop freely and through this freedom, develop a sense of social justice. The Association was essentially anarchist, unwedded to a particular ideal, but to the free expression of opinion and exchange of ideas. The school would be both a protected island against the influence of middle-class America, and a force to propel cultural and political revolution. The Association found little agreement on school policy apart from that education was a process of educing a children's latent talents rather than a process of imposing dogma. The founders had little experience with education or parenting, apart from some having taught in the Workmen's Circle radical Sunday Schools, and trusting no authority, would hold long debates with no effect. Some Association members interfered in the classroom to the objection of other members. The day school teacher was not expected to uphold a religious or social dogma but instead to \\"have the libertarian spirit\\" and answer children's questions truthfully. The teachers had low salaries and high turnover, including multiple scrambles for staffing. No principal stayed longer than a year between 1911 and 1916. The Ferrer Modern School also suffered its environmental conditions. The Center's original location at 6 St. Mark's Place was established in haste and could not house a day school for lack of outdoor play space and park access. It moved several blocks north to 104 East Twelfth Street just before the school opened for the school year in 1911. This location had an outdoor play space but the building continued to lack standard school equipment and was less accessible to radical families, so the school moved farther north in October 1912 to an older building in East Harlem, 63 East 107th Street, which had a stronger immigrant population and rested three blocks from Central Park. The three- story building included an unusable ground level floor, a large room on the second floor where two classes occurred at once, and a small office and kitchen on the third floor, where the adult anarchists congregated. Enrollment rose despite the school's conditions. By 1914, the school taught 30 children and turned away half its applicants. Historian Laurence Veysey attributes this rise to the expressiveness and love shared between students and their teachers, and to a cultural \\"union of enthusiasms\\" in the Ferrer movement, in which new Jewish immigrants, whose families tended towards warm affection and interest in education, met a body of Americans who equally wanted to be their teachers. The day school's students were predominantly from immigrant, garment industry worker families with radical or anarchist politics. Like the Association itself, early principals of the day school were native born, largely with degrees from Ivy League schools and not Jewish. They were possibly propelled by their interest in upending the status quo, altruism for the poor, and a curiosity for bohemian life in the ghetto, as juxtaposed against their urban, predictable upper-middle class lives. The school moved multiple times and ultimately closed in 1953. Students would \\"often\\" not learn to read until ten or twelve years old.  Stelton colony  = Selection = Harry Kelly arranged the move to Stelton, New Jersey, about 30 miles from New York City. The anarchist printer and Association member selected the site, a farm within two miles of a railroad station. The group bought the land and resold plots to colonists at fair market value while setting aside land for the school. As anarchists, the colonists did not uphold a common doctrine towards property, and disagreed on whether private property should be preserved or abolished. Plots were individually owned such that, in the spirit of anarchist volunteerism, anyone could sell and exit the colony at their prerogative. ... They hoped the colony could form the center of a national libertarian education movement. = Stelton Modern School = The school at Stelton was founded in 1914. It floundered in its first years. In 1916, the socialist William Thurston Brown, who had experience operating modern schools, became Stelton's principal. Stelton's lessons were non-compulsory and the school had no discipline or set curriculum, same as it was in New York City. Students joined in craft and outdoor activities. In addition to students from colonist families, between 30 and 40 children boarded at the school in what was formerly a farmhouse. Next to the farmhouse, Stelton built an open-air dormitory. Their winters were cold. Margaret Sanger's daughter died of pneumonia contracted in the boarding house. Nellie and James Dick operated the boarding house for children, known as the Living House. The couple had formerly opened Ferrer schools in their original England and elsewhere in the United States. They promoted freedom and spontaneity in education. In their dorms, the Dicks taught personal responsibility. In 1920, Elizabeth and Alexis Ferm became Stelton's co-principals. The couple had previously run schools in New York City. Their methods emphasized manual work and crafts‚Äîe.g., pottery, gardening, carpentry, dance‚Äîheld in the schoolhouse's workshops. Alternatively, students could study in the library with James Dick. Following disagreement with some parents, who wanted the school to put more emphasis on reading and class-struggle politics, the Ferms left the school in 1925 rather than compromise their technique. The school briefly floundered between 1925 and 1928, when the Dicks returned as co-principals. They renovated the dilapidated children's dormitories, resurrected the children-run periodical, and added a range of adult activities. The Dicks left in 1933 to pursue their longtime wish of opening their own Modern School in Lakewood, New Jersey. The Ferms were recruited to return in the mid-1930s, when the school population declined as the Great Depression depleted family incomes. The American government established a military base adjacent to and with negative effects for the colony. Elizabeth Ferm died in 1944 and her husband retired four years later. The school had diminished to 15 pupils at the time. The school closed in 1953.  Legacy  Laurence Veysey described the association as \\"one of the most notable‚Äîthough unremembered‚Äîattempts to create a counter-culture in America\\". Of its accomplishments, Veysey counted the association of (1) college-educated native Americans with recent, Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe, and of (2) intellectuals with laborers. Veysey called the Ferrer Modern School one of the few \\"truly advanced\\" American progressive schools of the 1920s.

Succeeding the Samsung Galaxy S5, the S6 was not released as a singular model, but instead in two variations unveiled and marketed together‚Äîthe Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge‚Äîwith the latter differentiated primarily by having a display that is wrapped along the sides of the device. The S6 and S6 Edge were unveiled on March 1, 2015, during the Samsung Unpacked press event at MWC Barcelona, and released April 10, 2015. During the subsequent Samsung Unpacked event on August 13, 2015 (alongside the Galaxy Note 5), Samsung unveiled a third model, the Galaxy S6 Edge+, which features a larger phablet-sized display (5.7 inches instead of 5.1 inches) and more memory (4 GB RAM instead of 3 GB), but lacks an infrared transmitter used for remote controlling. Although the overall design of the Galaxy S6 still features characteristics from prior models, its construction was revamped to use a metal unibody frame and glass backing instead of plastic. Samsung also promoted an improved camera, streamlined user interface, support for major wireless charging standards, and support for a mobile payments platform that allows the device to emulate the magnetic strip from a credit card. The Galaxy S6 received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised the devices' upgraded build quality over prior models, along with improvements to their displays, performance, camera, and other changes. However, Samsung's decision to remove the ability for users to expand their storage using MicroSD cards or remove the battery, and the lack of water resistance were panned as being potentially alienating to power users, and the S6 Edge was also panned for not making enough use of its curved display to justify its increased cost over the standard model on-launch. It was succeeded by the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge in March 2016.  Development  = Rumors = Rumors surrounding the Galaxy S5's successor began to surface in January 2015, it was reported that Samsung would be using an in-house Exynos system-on-chip rather than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 on the S6 due to concerns surrounding overheating. Later that month, Qualcomm affirmed in an earnings report that its products would not be included in \\"[a] large customer's flagship device\\". Fellow competitor LG Electronics disputed the allegations surrounding the 810; although demo units of the 810-equipped LG G Flex 2 at Consumer Electronics Show experienced signs of possible overheating, the company emphasized that they were pre-release models. In early-February 2015, Bloomberg News reported that the S6 was to have a metal body, and was to be produced in a normal version, and a version with a screen curved along the left and right sides of the device, similarly to the Galaxy Note Edge. The S6's design was officially teased in a promotional webpage released by T-Mobile US on 22 February 2015, which showed a curved body and carried the tagline \\"Six Appeal\\".  Keynote  Samsung officially unveiled the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge during the first Samsung Unpacked 2015 event at Mobile World Congress on 1 March 2015, for a release on 10 April 2015 in 20 countries. In Japan, the S6 and S6 Edge are marketed solely under the Galaxy brand, with most references to Samsung removed; sales of Samsung phones have been impacted by historical relations between Japan and South Korea, and a Samsung spokesperson stated that the Galaxy brand was \\"well-established\\" in the country. = Design changes = The Galaxy S6 models are designed to address criticisms and feedback received from prior models, and target the majority of users; during its unveiling, Samsung stated that it had placed a particular focus on design, its camera, and wireless charging. As part of these goals, a number of features and capabilities seen on the Galaxy S5 were removed, such as its waterproofing USB 3.0 port, MicroSD expandable internal storage and Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL). Additionally, the Galaxy S6's battery is no longer user-replaceable; Samsung had been a major holdout from the trend against removable batteries, but argued that due to the S6's fast AC charging and its support of both major wireless charging standards, it no longer needs to provide the ability for users to remove and replace the Lithium-Ion battery. The device's software was also simplified; a Samsung representative stated that 40% of the features in TouchWiz were removed or streamlined in comparison to the S5.  Specifications  = Hardware and design =  Design  The Galaxy S6 Edge is similar in concept to the Galaxy Note Edge, although the curvature of the screen is toned down in comparison. The Galaxy S6 Edge+The Galaxy S6 line retains similarities in design to previous models, but now uses a unibody frame made of aluminium alloy 6013 with a glass backing, a curved bezel with chamfered sides to improve grip, and the speaker grille was moved to the bottom. The devices are available in \\"White Pearl\\", \\"Black Sapphire\\", and \\"Gold Platinum\\" color finishes; additional \\"Blue Topaz\\" and \\"Emerald Green\\" finishes are exclusive to the S6 and S6 Edge respectively. The Galaxy S6 was also available in a limited Iron Man edition with six additional colour options.Samsung about the Avengers colour option The S6 carries some regressions in its design over the S5; it does not contain a MicroSD card slot, and reverts to a micro-USB 2.0 port from USB 3.0. Both also lack water resistance use non-removable batteries with decreased sizes.  Battery  The Galaxy S6 includes a 2550 mAh battery, while the S6 Edge includes a 2600 mAh battery, both non-user-replaceable. The Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are the first mobile phones in the Samsung Galaxy S series to support Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0, allowing it to reach charging speeds of up to 15 Watts if used with a compatible charger. However, fast charging is deactivated while the device is in operation.Samsung Galaxy S6 online guide: How to charge Galaxy S6 battery, what is Galaxy S6 fast charging and what is Galaxy S6 wireless charging (reference covers Galaxy S7 and S6.  Hardware  The Galaxy S6 line is powered by a 64-Bit Exynos 7 Octa 7420 system-on- chip, consisting of four 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57 cores, and four 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 cores, and 3 GB of LPDDR4 RAM for the S6 and S6 Edge while 4 GB of LPDDR4 for the S6 Edge+, being the first Samsung flagship phones to utilize 64-Bit processing. The processor is Samsung's first to use a 14 nm FinFET manufacturing process, which the company stated would improve its energy efficiency. It is available with 32, 64, or 128 GB of non-expandable storage, implementing Universal Flash Storage 2.0 standards. The S6 and S6 Edge features a 5.1-inch 1440p Super AMOLED display; similarly to the Galaxy Note Edge while the S6 Edge+ features a 5.7-inch 1440p Super AMOLED display, the S6 Edge and S6 Edge+'s display is slightly curved around the two lengthwise edges of the device, although not as aggressively as the Note Edge. The Galaxy S6 line supports both the Qi and Power Matters Alliance wireless charging standards. Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL), a feature introduced with the Galaxy S2 in 2011, has been removed from the series with the Galaxy S6.  Cameras  For its rear-facing camera, Galaxy S6 uses the same image sensor (Sony Exmor RS IMX240) with optical image stabilization as the Galaxy Note 4,Review of the Samsung Galaxy S6 camera by GSM Arena albeit with a f/1.9 aperture (compared to f/2.2), object tracking autofocus, real-time HDR, and using the infrared of the heart rate sensor for calibrating white balance. Samsung claimed that the camera upgrades would allow it to have better low- light performance. For the first time in a Samsung Mobile flagship device, the Galaxy S6's camera software recorded slow-motion videos (720p@120fps) using the real-time method with audio. For the first time in a Samsung flagship device, a bundled slow-motion video editor allows viewing custom parts of the recorded footage at adjustable speeds and exporting it for sharing. The front-facing camera was also upgraded from 2.1 megapixels to 5 megapixels, supports 1440p video recording for the first time on a Galaxy S series device, and also features an aperture of f/1.9 and being equipped with HDR viewfinder for the first time in a front camera. The fingerprint scanner in the home button now uses a touch-based scanning mechanism rather than swipe-based. Double-pressing the Home button launches the camera app, while it launched S Voice, then Samsung's digital assistant software, on Samsung flagship phones released between 2012 and 2014. Both the front and the rear camera support burst shots, limited to 30 pictures per row.Samsung Galaxy S6 camera: Burst shot guide by Gadget Guide Online The design of the camera software has been changed. Changes include the introduction of swipe gesture controls for accessing camera modes and gallery and a camera mode selector that is a flat two-row icon+label grid. Additional camera modes can be downloaded. The Android Marshmallow update added manual camera controls. The setting menu is no longer a four-column icon+label grid floating on top of the camera viewfinder, but a list on a separate page. Setting shortcuts are no longer customizable.Video: Review of the Samsung Galaxy S6 camera by PhoneDog (5 minutes) = Software = The S6 and S6 Edge were initially released running Android 5.0.2 \\"Lollipop\\" while the S6 Edge+ was initially released running Android 5.1.1 \\"Lollipop\\" with Samsung's TouchWiz software suite. TouchWiz has been streamlined on the S6 with a refreshed, minimal design and fewer bundled applications. Samsung newly allows users to download custom themes.\\"Inside TouchWiz themes\\" ‚Äî Android Central Several Microsoft apps are bundled, including OneDrive, OneNote and Skype. On the S6 Edge and S6 Edge+, users can designate up to five contacts for quick access by swiping from one of the edges of the screen. The five contacts are also color-coded; when the device is face down, the curved sides will also glow in the contact's color to signify phone calls. The Night Clock feature from the Galaxy Note Edge was carried over to the Edge models. The heart rate sensor can also be used as a button for dismissing calls and sending the caller a canned text message reply. The Sprint, Verizon, AT&T; and T-Mobile versions remove some features available on the unbranded and unlocked version, like Smart Manager, Simple Sharing (only AT&T;) and Download Booster (only Sprint and AT&T;).  Samsung Pay  The S6 was the first Samsung device to include Samsung Pay, a mobile payments service developed from the intellectual property of LoopPay, a crowdfunded startup company that Samsung acquired in February 2015. Samsung Pay incorporates technology by LoopPay known as \\"Magnetic Secure Transmission\\" (MST); it transmits card data to the pay terminal's swipe slot using an electromagnetic field, causing the terminal to register it as if it were a normally swiped card. LoopPay's developers noted that its system would not share the limitations of other mobile payment platforms, and would work with \\"nearly 90%\\" of all point-of-sale units in the United States. The service will also support NFC-based mobile payments alongside MST. Credit card information is stored in a secure token and payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan. Samsung Pay was not immediately available upon the release of the S6, but enabled in the middle of 2015.  Multi-window  While flagship devices since the Galaxy S3 support splitting the screen to show two applications simultaneously, the Galaxy S6 is the first Galaxy S series phone to support floating pop-up multi windows. The multi-window user interface is similar to that of the Galaxy Note 4, but applications are launched out of a dedicated split-screen app drawer (accessed through holding the task key or tapping an icon in recent apps drawer) instead of a floating side bar,Video: Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Tip: How to use the Multiwindow feature (5 minutes, October 22nd 2014) which means that although floating pop-up windows can float on top of applications not supported by multi-window, the split-screen app launching interface requires an unsupported application to be minimized to be accessed, to allow launching a multi-window supported app. Multi-window applications can also be launched by holding down an app listed in the view of recently accessed apps that is accessed using the task key that is located on the left next to the home button.Samsung Galaxy S6 multi-window guide - Gadget Guide Online  Software updates  Samsung began to release Android 6.0.1 \\"Marshmallow\\" for the S6 in February 2016. It enables new features such as \\"Google Now on Tap\\", which allows users to perform searches within the context of information currently being displayed on-screen, and \\"Doze\\", which optimizes battery usage when the device is not being physically handled. On S6 Edge models, the Edge Display feature supports wider panels with a larger amount of functionality similar to those found on the S7 Edge. In March 2017 Samsung began to release Android 7.0. \\"Nougat\\" to the European, American, Canadian and Indian Variants After the update the UI (User Interface) was redesigned and it is similar to Galaxy S7 except Video Enhancer, Screen Resolution Adjuster, Performance Mode and the ability to take photos while recording video. The latest update for the S6 family is based on Android 7.0. \\"Nougat\\" with the November 2018 security build. There have been various reports that the S6 family will receive Android 8.0 \\"Oreo\\" but it didn't as of January 2019. On September 3, 2018, the S6 has received the final security patch as Samsung discontinued the S6 family.  Miscellaneous  The Galaxy S6 is the first Samsung flagship device to offer a torch toggle shortcut in the drop-down quick control menu instead of a home screen widget, making it accessible quicker and without having to leave an opened app. \\"Where's the flashlight app on the Galaxy S6?\\" ‚Äî Android Authority  Reception  = Critical reception = The Galaxy S6 received a generally positive reaction from early reviewers, noting its higher quality design over previous Samsung devices, along with refinements to its camera, the high quality of its display, and the significantly smaller amount of \\"bloat\\" in the device's software. Anandtech believed that the S6's new fingerprint reader was comparable in quality to Apple's Touch ID system. The Verge concluded that the S6 and S6 Edge were \\"the first time I‚Äôve felt like Samsung might finally be grappling with the idea of what a smartphone ought to be on an ontological level.\\" Some critics raised concerns over the S6's regressions in functionality over the Galaxy S5, particularly the battery being both smaller in capacity and non-user-replaceable, the missing microSD card slot, and lack of water resistance, arguing that it could alienate power users who were attracted to the Galaxy S series due to their inclusion. Wired felt while its dual-sided curved screen was better-designed than that of the Galaxy Note Edge, the S6 Edge's use of the curved display was a \\"dramatic step backwards\\" due to the limited number of edge-specific features available in comparison to the Galaxy Note Edge due to the edge bending into existing screen space rather than extending by 160 pixels. As such, Samsung was criticized for providing no true justification for purchasing the S6 Edge over the non-curved S6, explaining that \\"it doesn‚Äôt do anything beyond the base model, but it'll be worth the money to some people because of how it looks and the air of exclusivity it communicates.\\" The Verge was similarly critical, arguing that the additional features were \\"very forgettable\\". In regards to performance, The Verge felt that the S6 was the \\"fastest Android phone I've ever used\\", and that the company \\"solved any slowdowns you might experience in Android with brute force.\\" Some users reported issues with the flash on some S6 devices, remaining dimly lit even if the camera is not in use or the device is turned off. Samsung was made aware of the problem, which affects the S6 and S6 Edge, but has not specified when it will be fixed. iFixit upon review of the phone noted it is difficult to repair, as it is using strong adhesive in its rear glass and the battery. = Security issues = In November 2015, Google's Project Zero unit publicized eleven \\"high-impact\\" security vulnerabilities that it had discovered in Samsung's distribution of Android on the S6. Some of these had already been patched as of their publication. = Sales = In its first month of sales, 6 million Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge units were sold to consumers, exceeding the number of Galaxy S5 units sold within a similar timeframe, but failing to break the record of 10 million set by the Galaxy S4. Still, facing competition by other vendors that have led to declining market share, a lower net profit, and foreseeing a \\"difficult business environment\\" for the second half of the year, Samsung announced during its second quarter earnings report in July 2015 that it would be \\"adjusting\\" the price of the S6 and S6 Edge. The company stated that sales of the two devices had a \\"marginal\\" effect on its profits. The S6 Edge+ shared almost a similar fate albeit lagging behind the Note 5.

A fairly significant number of Khakh also reside in Western nations, namely Canada , the United Kingdom and the US. These are likely to be Khakh caste-members, and their descendants, who immigrated to these developed countries in recent years. Relatively, the village of Khakh in Hoshiarpur District, in the Indian state of Punjab, is also named after this clan. An even larger town (by population), that is also named after the Khakh people, is located in Tarn Taran District of the Punjab State of India. The Khakh clan also overlaps with the Malik (Jat) clan, as some people with the surname Khakh also identify themselves with the last name Malik. Many of these are Muslims that reside in the South Punjab region of Pakistan.

It was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 1288‚Äì1293 in its catalogues. Plot In a room labelled \\"English School under the management of Miss Blackford,\\" four French policemen and their chief are practicing English words. Miss Blackford, writing \\"What a fair fish\\" on her blackboard, tells one of the policemen to translate it into French; his attempt is \\"Va te faire fiche.\\" The process repeats, with \\"Very well thank you\\" translated as \\"Manivelle St. Cloud.\\" Miss Blackford, holding up a placard reading \\"Conversation,\\" lets in four young English ladies; the policemen and ladies court each other fervently. The lesson is interrupted by the entrance of a higher-ranking officer, a Police Inspector, who is appalled at the sight of the police force in chaotic flirtation. However, when the \\"Conversation\\" placard is shown to him by way of explanation, he is immediately appeased, and nods cheerfully. The entire classroom bursts into a raucous can-can dance as the Inspector holds up a placard reading \\"Entente Cordiale.\\" Production In 1908, the Motion Picture Patents Company changed the standardized prices used in the American film market, with films priced systematically by length. Though previous price standardizations had been useful to M√©li√®s, the 1908 changes worked against him and contributed to his financial difficulties; under the new standards, his carefully planned and executed films were too expensive and time-consuming to make a profit. In an attempt to keep up with the new demands, M√©li√®s doubled his output in 1908, turning out simpler films as quickly as possible from his two glass studios in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis. French Cops Learning English was filmed in M√©li√®s's original glass studio, Studio A, rather than the larger and newer Studio B. M√©li√®s plays the Police Inspector. As the placard at the end of the film suggests, the film is a topical comedy about the Entente Cordiale established in 1904 between Great Britain and France. During the Entente, English tourists flocked to Paris; by 1907, they were so common that the Parisian Prefect of Police, Louis L√©pine, formed a squad of police interpreters to help tourists overcome the language barrier. M√©li√®s used the topical subject to poke fun of the police in their roles as authority figures, a recurring theme in his films. As Richard Abel has noted, M√©li√®s's set is designed on a rigorously geometrical layout, emphasizing the systematic and marionette-like antics of the police students. Miss Blackford's outfit is that of a gommeuse, a sensual and eccentrically comic type of caf√© concert singer. The extensive use of placards and other written text is unusual for a M√©li√®s film, but necessary for plot comprehension, and especially for the wordplay.

It was originally created by Toni Fingerroos, Fingersoft's founder, and is the company's best-known product. The player controls a driver across hilly terrains, collecting coins along the way and spending them on vehicular upgrades while being watchful of the driver's head as well as the vehicle's fuel supply. The game received generally somewhat favorable reviews. Critics tended to describe the graphics as being rudimentary at best or ugly at worst and sometimes panned the gameplay as unimpressive, but the former was overlooked when they lauded the physics. Further praise went to the simplistic two-button controls and the freemium monetization model for its passive approach. Its success led to the creation of one sequel, Hill Climb Racing 2 in 2016, and in 2018, the Hill Climb Racing franchise became the second Finnish mobile game franchise after Rovio's Angry Birds to amass one billion downloads.  Gameplay  Screenshot illustrating elevation as the main aspect of the game. Throughout this course, coins are spread in groups, with some of them accompanied by fuel and gems (as shown on the center-right). The top-left portion of the screen comprises the fuel gauge and an inventory of coins and gems. The object of Hill Climb Racing is to drive as far through progressively difficult racing stages as possible while collecting coins, taking advantage of the nonrealistic physics and using only two simple controls: the Gas and Brake pedals. While in midair, pressing these pedals will instead cause the vehicle to rotate, allowing the player to control the angle with which they land. Fuel is replenished by picking up gas canisters or batteries along the way. The player can perform stunts such as driving the vehicle into the air for a prolonged time or flipping it over to earn more coins, which after the race may be spent on upgrades or to unlock new stages and vehicles (including monster trucks, dirt bikes, tanks, and Santa's sleigh). Conditions ending the game are depleting the vehicle's fuel or hitting the driving avatar's head. Since its inception, Hill Climb Racing has seen updates that add new content. For example, the garage was introduced in a December 2016 update, where players can purchase cars and tune their parts. Gems were also introduced as a currency of the game.  Development  Hill Climb Racing was developed by Toni Fingerroos, a self-taught Finnish programmer who was 29 years old at the time of the game's release. Prior to the game, he started writing software at the age of ten. He was intrigued by car racing, and wrote Ralli 94 and shared it with his friends. At that time, when he thought that games were developed by firms and not by people, he named his own hobbyist firm Fingersoft. A decade after his first game, Fingerroos revived the Fingersoft trade name as a professional studio that programmed games for Nokia mobile phones. Fingerroos described he \\"failed at that quite miserably.\\" He since pursued other occupations, all with unfavorable outcomes. One of them was working with Pixolane, a game studio, and spending his money on developing a PlayStation 3 game called Rust Buckaneers that was ultimately cancelled as the studio wasted its seed money, which caused him to accumulate debt. Another was repairing and selling sports cars imported from Japan and the United Kingdom, which also drained his personal savings. Fingerroos returned to and revived again Fingersoft in late 2011, where as the company's sole worker, he designed a photography application every few days to see whether some of them would turn out to be successful. One of these apps was Cartoon Camera, released in February 2012 and having quickly amassed over ten million downloads. The app's profitability strengthened Fingerroos' confidence, helped him pay off debts, and secured the creation of his next project, Hill Climb Racing. Fingerroos said he spent 16 hours a day for a couple of months developing Hill Climb Racing in a compact bedroom before completing the project. The sound assets were crowdsourced, and his friends and acquaintances drew the visuals. As Fingersoft's business manager, Jarkko Paalanen, states, the visuals were intentionally drawn to be \\"na√Øve and childish\\", as part of the game's character. Bill Newton, the game's protagonist, was drawn as a sketch by Fingerroos' partner Pai Turunen. Fingerroos then photographed the sketch with one of the company's earlier camera apps and modified it for the game's inclusion. It was released for Android devices on September 22, 2012. Amid the game's success, Fingerroos contacted Teemu N√§rhi, a former Pixoline employee, to port the game for iOS. That version was released on November 8, and the game was later ported to Microsoft Windows on October 21, 2013, and to Windows Phone on November 27. = Chinese version = Fingersoft had plans to localize Hill Climb Racing in China. They had already released the original game in that region in July 2014, in collaboration with MyGamez, a Finnish-Chinese game publisher specializing in marketing non-native mobile games to China. Paalanen saw an opportunity to appeal to the Chinese audience by altering the game's theme to match their culture, while keeping the gameplay unchanged. Hill Climb Racing: China Edition was published by MyGamez in February 2015, coinciding with Chinese New Year.  Reception  Hill Climb Racings critical reception was somewhat positive, with praise often going to the game's physics. Criticism was normally focused on the visuals, but that was often overlooked when the physics was tested. Modojos John Bedford respectively dismissed the graphics and soundtrack as rudimentary and repetitive, but found a great deal of satisfaction in mastering the controls and called the game \\"furiously addictive.\\" SFGates Peter Hartlaub praised the ability to upgrade vehicles, as he found it to dramatically improve the player's experience and demonstrate the game's \\"subtle\\" physics. Even though he found Ski Safari, a similar racing game, to have a more sophisticated gameplay and better graphics and be more cartoonishly \\"fun,\\" he also found Hill Climb Racing more engaging and concluded that the game is \\"a good example of the importance of mechanics over visuals in [the mobile gaming] market.\\" Pocket Gamers Harry Slater compared it to Trials and found it to be less \\"bombastic\\" and the graphics slightly ugly, but praised the simplicity of the gameplay. He called the game unimpressive, but decent in the genre of physics-based racing games and enjoyable. Swedish magazine Mobils Elias Nordling considered the game's freemium model and noted the progression system as fast enough to not make the in-app purchases tempting. He found the controls simple and the physics difficult, but his main complaint was the fact that when starting any level, the player always starts from the beginning, rather than from the highest achieved level. Elias concluded that that obscured the feeling of achieving anything, but he ultimately liked it and found it to be addictive. In the book Finnish Video Games: A History and Catalog, Juho Kuorikoski also found the monetization to be reasonable and the mechanics addictive. He described the visuals as being \\"amateuristic\\" and particularly ugly for a successful game, but later argued that \\"good graphics don't make a good game\\". =Sales= In its first fiscal year, Fingersoft reported that it gained a total of ‚Ç¨15.5 million in revenue via advertisements and in-app purchases. The company's net sales continued to rise until 2018, when Fingersoft reported net sales of ‚Ç¨21 million, down from 2017's ‚Ç¨29.6 million. This was attributed to the company's focus on building its team and not releasing any title in 2018, and its older games continued to be profitable. A few journalists have described the game's performance as having transformed Fingersoft into a \\"rags-to-riches\\" app studio. In October 2013, Fingersoft announced that Hill Climb Racing had been downloaded 100 million times. In 2014, Hill Climb Racing had over 40 million active players playing it on a monthly basis. Near the end of April 2018, the company's CEO, N√§rhi, confirmed the franchise surpassed one billion downloads, becoming the second Finnish mobile game franchise‚Äîafter Rovio's Angry Birds‚Äîto reach the mark.  Sequel  Hill Climb Racing 2 was released to Android devices on November 28, 2016, to iOS in December 2016, and to Windows 10 on March 23, 2018. The sequel introduced several new features including races, multiplayer, and a large amount of cosmetic player and vehicle customization.However due to issues Hill Climb Racing 2 has been taken down on Windows 10.It is now only available on Android and IOS.

On 8 November 1989 he was elected to membership of the powerful Central Committee of the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party where he sat as the committee's youngest member. A couple of days later the Berlin Wall was breached, setting in motion events that would lead to reunification in October 1990. Much sooner than that, however, the promising career of Willerding at the top level of the East Germany's political power structure was cut short on 2 December 1989 when the Central Committee resigned en masse. Life Then son of the diplomat , Jochen Willerding was born in Berlin where he attended school between 1958 and 1964. Between 1964 and 1968 he received his schooling in Ulan Bator where his father was serving as the East German ambassador. His father's next posting, between 1969 and 1972, was to Hanoi, but the boy returned to East Germany, undertaking the final three years of his schooling at Bad Freienwalde and passing his final school exams in 1972. He had joined the Free German Youth organisation (FDJ/) ) in 1966 and the ruling (SED / ') in 1971. He then relocated to Moscow in 1972, where he studied at the State Institute of International Relations and received his degree in 1977. He obtained his doctorate, from the Wilhelm Pieck University (as it was then called) in Rostock just a year later. Willerding had already, in 1971/72, worked as an instructor in the FDJ, and after completing his studies he returned to the organisation, which was in effect the youth wing of the SED, as a ahead office official. From he was a member of the FDJ Central Committee and from 1979 Secretary responsible for Work with the West (f√ºr \\"Westarbeit\\" - essentially with West Germany).Herms, Michael/Popp, Karla: \\"Westarbeit der FDJ 1946-1989\\", Berlin 1997. Later, in 1982, he would also become deputy chairman of the FDJ. In 1981 he was elected a member of the National Legislature (Volkskammer). Although he was a member of the ruling SED (party), in the Volkskammer he sat as a representative of the FDJ which, as an approved quasi-political mass movement, received a quota of 37 seats. From 1982 till 11 November 1989, he led the FDJ group in the chamber. He was also a member of the Volkskammer Committee on Foreign Affairs. In 1986 the name of Hans-Joachim Willerding appeared on the candidate list for membership of the party Central Committee. This was an important step under a constitutional structure that by now expressly asserted the \\"leading role\\" of the party, above government ministers and the national legislature. On 8 November 1989 he was elected to Central Committee membership and proposed by Hans Modrow for membership of the Central Committee secretariat and Politburo. At 37 Willerding was the youngest member of the nation's newly expanded leadership team. However, November 1989 Berlin Wall was breached by protestors, and once it became apparent that the occupying military forces had no orders to suppress the popular demonstrations by force, it appeared that nothing stood in the way of the momentum building for German reunification. On 2 December 1989, the Central Committee recognized its powerlessness to shape events, and resigned. East Germany's first and last free election would follow in March 1990. East Germany's (hitherto ruling) SED (party) now responded swiftly to the tide of events by renaming and then reinventing itself as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS /) '). The reborn party held its first Party Conference on 9 December 1989, and Jochen Willerding was one of those elected to the Party Presidium. He was also a member of the party's Commission for International Policy: in this capacity he traveled to Moscow and participated on 12 September 1990 in the important meeting with Valentin Falin, then Central Committee Secretary of the Soviet party's and Chairman of its International Section. The meeting concerned the Soviet attitude to German reunification, formal implementation of which would take place in October 1990. The 1990 General election took place on 18 March and Willerding was a candidate. Between 1950 and 1986 national elections in the German Democratic Republic had been organised according to a single list system whereby voters could vote to support or reject a single list of candidates. The record indicated that the single list had always been supported by more than 99% of those voting. For 1990, however, each party was permitted to place its own candidate list before the electorate. The PDS gained 16.4% of the national vote, entitling it to 66 seats in the National assembly (Volkskammer), and Jochen Willerding's name was high enough up his party's list to give him a seat in the new chamber. He sat as a PDS member till 3 October 1990, which was when the East Germany national assembly dissolved itself in order to make way for the first election of the reunited Germany, which duly took place on 3 December 1990. Following reunification Willerding withdrew from politics and worked in the private sector, later operating as a consultant to German companies working in Russia and China.

She was also appointed a fellow of St Hilda's College, Oxford. In Oxford, Anderson continued her research the birth process in sheep and humans and also took on studies of the causes and management of preterm labor, gynecological endocrinology, and infertility. Anderson started one of the first menopause clinics in Oxford, within the Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, at John Radcliffe Hospital. In addition to doing her laboratory and clinical work, Anderson served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Endocrinology and the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. In 1980, Anderson was elected chairman of the Blair Bell Research Society, and in 1981 she was elected as a fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, London. Later work Anderson had an active interest in women's health, co-editing the first edition (1983) of Women's Problems in General Practice with Ann McPherson. Anne also contributed to Effectiveness and Satisfaction in Antenatal Care (1982), edited by Murray Enkin and Iain Chalmers, and was discussing, with Marc Keirse and Iain Chalmers, the possibility of co-editing a companion volume on Effective Care in Labour and Delivery. However, Anderson's illness and premature death from breast cancer at age 46 ended her involvement. Iain Chalmers, Murray Enkin and Marc Keirse went on to publish Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth (ECPC) in 1989, dedicating the book in part to Anderson. Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth, through its systematic approach to assessing the research literature, is widely acknowledged to have led to development of a similar project for all of medicine and health, the Cochrane Collaboration. Legacy The Anne Anderson Award is presented each year by the Cochrane Collaboration. Recipients are women and are selected based on emotional and cognitive intelligence, serving as an inspiration to others, evidence of cumulative accomplishment, originality and independence of thought, personal qualities, team building, leadership and mentorship. The recipient of the Anne Anderson Award receives a plaque from the Cochrane Collaboration honoring her contributions. The cash award of US$3000 is designated by the recipient to assist one woman from a low resource setting with her Cochrane Collaboration activities.

It is native to arid regions of South America, where it is known as jarilla or jarillo. It was first described in 1800 by the Spanish botanist Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles. Description Larrea divaricata is a slow-growing shrub growing to a maximum height of . The stems are cylindrical. The small, dark green, elliptical leaves are resinous and grow in opposite pairs. The yellow flowers have five petals and appear in October and November. The fruits are dry capsules containing greyish hairs and five seeds. The plant is dispersed when goats eat the leaves and seed capsules in the dry season when little grass is available. Distribution and habitat L. divaricata Larrea divaricata is endemic to southwestern South America. Its range includes Bolivia, Peru, Chile, and Argentina, especially Patagonia. It is found in open woodland, scrubland, and rough grassland. This plant only grows in South America, whereas the closely related Larrea tridentata occurs in North America. The two have been confused in the past, but in the 1940s, they were found to be separate species. Uses The resin contains lignans, polyphenolic substances with possible therapeutic uses. The plant also contains guaiaretic acid and its derivatives, flavonoids, triterpenes, and other organic substances. In Bolivia, an extract of L. divaricata has been used as an abortifacient. Since this plant is suspected of being used as an adulterant in preparations of \\"chapperal\\", a herbal remedy made from L. tridentata, the use of that substance during pregnancy and lactation is not advised.

The drink is identified as Basque, but was created by Basque immigrants in the U.S. and taken back to the Basque region in the Pyrenees. It is popular in Basque restaurants and bars in Boise and southern Idaho, in Bakersfield and rural Northern and Central California, and throughout Northern Nevada.

Amaro CioCiaro is another acceptable liqueur that can be substituted. In Northern Nevada, the Picon Punch is served with ice in a custom stemmed glass produced by the Louie Picon Glass Company of Sparks, Nevada.

Reception and legacy  Drive-in film critic Joe Bob Briggs called it \\"a pretty much by-the- numbers, micro-budget effort\\". Jerry White of Beyond Hollywood wrote that the film is enjoyably bad, as many scenes are unintentionally funny. Daniel Benson of HorrorTalk rated it 2/5 stars and wrote that the film's special effects can not overcome the other faults, including poor writing and acting. Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle said, \\"The filmmakers exploit the limited location as best they can\\" but \\"there's little build-up of tension\\".

Biography  B√ºrger was born at Seitsch in the former Prussian province of Silesia (German: Schlesien; since 1945 a part of Poland), near the border of Posen. His Protestant father Oscar B√ºrger was an economic inspector and his mother Maria of the Willenberg family. From 1878 to 1883 he attended Grammar school in Glogau. At the age of 17 he moved to Berlin to be enrolled at the University of Berlin, then a stronghold of source-critical historicism and philology, where he studied classical philology and ancient history from 1883 to 1887. Among his notable professors in philology were Ernst Maass and Hermann Diels, and in history Elimar Klebs, Hans Droysen, and Ulrich K√∂hler. After receiving his Dr. phil. degree, B√ºrger made a career as a teacher in the grammar schools of Berlin, until 1892, when he was called to serve as the private teacher of Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia, the youngest son of Prince Albert of Prussia, regent of The Duchy of Brunswick. In the spring of 1896 he took up a teaching position at the Gymnasium of Blankenburg (Harz), where he was to spend most of his career as 'Oberlehrer' (head-teacher). He retired in the spring of 1927, and died in Blankenburg 1936 after suffering a stroke.De Lucio Patrensi sive de ratione inter Asinum q. f. Lucianeum Apuleique Metamorphoses intercedente.

Blankenburg am Harz: Verlag von Otto Kircher 1897. B√ºrger's major scholarly achievement was to disprove the hypothesis that there was a radical difference between the Greek and the Roman novels of antiquity, a difference that corresponded to the different national characters of the Greeks and the Romans. This hypothesis was much favored at the time in the writings of leading philologists such as Mommsen and Rohde.In his 1892 article, \\"Der antike Roman vor Petronius\\", Hermes 27, pp. 345-458, B√ºrger traces to Rohde and Mommsen the idea that there existed two radically different types of novels in antiquity, the Greek and the Roman, and claims that this view, although unfounded, had become a scholarly 'dogma'. B√ºrger achieved this by demonstrating the close literary-historical and structural affinity of the two extant Roman novels of Apuleius and Petronius to a certain fragmentary but well-attested Ancient Greek work of prose fiction, the Milesian Tales of Aristides of Miletus (2nd century BCE). This established that the specific type of ancient novel, commonly associated with the Romans, was originally just as Greek as the Ancient Greek Romance.\\"It is now agreed on all sides that Apuleius based his Metamorphoses on a Greek work by the same title, which Photius (Bibl. 129) describes as resembling the Lucianic ŒõŒøœçŒ∫ŒπŒøœÇ ·º¢ ·ΩÑŒΩŒøœÇ word for word except for its greater fullness. Both extant versions, the Apuleian and the Lucianic are derived independently from this lost Greek original, the \\"Ovos being a mere abridgment of the same, and the Latin Metamorphoses abundantly and fancifully interpolate\\". \\"The truth of this proposition was demonstrated fully for the first time by Karl Burger in his dissertation, De Lucio Patrensi (1887).\\" Ben Edwin Perry (1926) \\"An Interpretation of Apuleius' Metamorphoses\\", TPAPhA 57, 7, pp. 238-260; p. 238, with n. 2.As for B√ºrger's contribution to Petronian studies and his deconstruction of the nationalistic reading of Petronius by Mommsen and others, see Gottsk√°lk Jensson (2004) The Recollections of Encolpius. The Satyrica of Petronius as Milesian Fiction (Groningen), pp. 245-301; and Stephen Harrison (1998) \\"The Milesian Tales and the Roman Novel\\", Groningen Colloquia on the Novel 9, pp. 61-73. In his Dr. phil. dissertation from 1887 on the vexed subject of the Greek background of Apuleius' Metamorphoses, better known as The Golden Ass, B√ºrger demonstrated for the first time that Apuleius adapted his Roman novel ‚Äì with some fanciful interpolations of his own ‚Äì from a Greek original of the same title, preserved in abridged form in the Ancient Greek tale Loukios or the Ass that is found among the works of Lucian. B√ºrger never advanced to the rank of professor at a German university and his scholarly works were relatively limited in number compared to many of the great philologists of his time, but the few studies that he published have proven to be of enduring value for the study of the Ancient Novel.

His family moved to Singapore after the conclusion of World War II. He studied in Chung Cheng High School, where he skipped a grade due to academic excellence. After graduating, he worked as a substitute teacher at Kong Hwa School in order to save money for further studies. He had plans to go to China to study art, but his mother convinced him to study architecture instead. With the assistance of a donation from the Lee Foundation, he enrolled in the University of New South Wales in 1962, where he graduated with a first-class honours degree in architecture, and was also awarded a medal for being the top student. He furthered his studies at Yale University in 1965 with a masters in urban planning, where he was again awarded a medal for being the top student in the faculty.  Career  During his time in Yale, Liu formed close relationships with his professors. One them introduced Liu to I.M. Pei, who offered Liu a job at his firm. He also worked in Loder & Dunphy in Sydney. Following Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia in 1965, Liu felt a desire to \\"change the fate of Singaporeans\\". He was approached by Teh Cheang Wan, the Chief Executive Officer of the Housing and Development Board (HDB), and offered a job at HDB as head of the Design and Research Unit. In 1969, Liu returned to Singapore and joined HDB, eventually becoming its CEO in 1979. In 1989, he moved to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) as its CEO and chief planner, where his contributions included the revision of its Concept Plan. In 1992, Liu left public service to join RSP Architectures Planners and Engineers as a director. During this time, he designed Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore and the Chinese Cultural Centre. He also did city planning for more than fifty cities, among them Fuzhou. Fuzhou party secretary Xi Jinping, impressed by his city plan, also approached him to design Fuzhou Changle International Airport. In December 2017, at the age of 79, Liu left RSP to found Morrow Architects and Planners, named after his father's artistic studio.

Photo restoration by Michel Vuijlsteke. A photograph conservator is a professional who examines, documents, researches, and treats photographs, including documenting the structure and condition of art works through written and photographic records, monitoring conditions of works in storage and exhibition and transit environments., Job Posting for Conservator of Photography:Modern and Contemporary, SFMOMA. (2015). Retrieved February 28, 2015 from: http://www.conservators-converse.org/2015/02/job- posting-conservator-of-photography-modern-and-contemporary-sfmoma-san- francisco-ca/. This person also performs all aspects of the treatment of photographs and related artworks with adherence to the professional Code of Ethics.  Responsibilities  Responsibilities of a Photograph Conservator of course vary from institution to institution, however there are some critical functions that all conservators must perform in their roles as protectors of cultural heritage. Preventive conservation, examination and documentation, research, and treatment are core functions at the center of every photograph conservators responsibilities. = Preventive conservation = Preventive Conservation is a rather new specialty in the field and is in response to the need conservators feel for preserving objects post-treatment. As Barbara Appelbaum states, \\"The fact that conservators feel responsible for preserving object forever is noble, but, practically speaking, unrealistic.\\" Preventive conservation shifts the burden of preservation and protection onto measures like environmental controls such as temperature and relative humidity control, control of light levels present, and control of various contaminants. It also includes integrated pest management and emergency preparedness. All of these steps should be taken for each object before and after treatment, or in some cases in the place of treatment. The Photograph Conservator should be working on preventive conservation each day, as it is one of the most important ways to preserve objects when treatment isn't practical or necessary. Environmental controls Control of relative humidity and temperature is critical in the preservation of photographs. \\"Heat can accelerate deterioration and high relative humidity provides the moisture necessary to promote harmful chemical reactions in materials and, with high temperature encourages mold growth and insect activity\\" according to the Northeast Document Conservation Center. A prime example of proper archive storage and of archival friendly boxes. Proper storage can protect photographs from fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature and/or seasonal changes. Photographic prints and negatives are best stored in individual paper or plastic enclosures. Note that paper enclosures must pass the PAT test or Photographic Activity Test in order to be deemed safe for storage of photographic materials. Once the photographs are in their individual enclosures they must be boxed in archival quality boxes. Horizontal storage is usually recommended over vertical storage, as is storing photographs of similar size together to avoid abrasions or misplacing the smaller items. Negatives, which includes black and white or color negatives, slides, lantern slides, collodion wet and dry plate negatives, and silver gelatin wet and dry plate negatives should be stored upright and vertically along their longest edge. Padded boxes with dividers are often necessary as you do not want two glass plate negatives to touch each other. When packing the archival quality boxes, make sure to not pack them too heavy and label them accordingly. Scrapbooks and albums provide a particular challenge to conservators because they often contain a variety of components and media. They should not be stored with other archival collections if it can be avoided. Scrapbooks can either be digitally reproduced or if the original is deemed important enough, can be wrapped in archival quality paper or housed in a custom fitted box. Emergency preparedness and response The AAM, or American Alliance of Museums, defines an emergency response plan as \\"a series of written policies and procedures that prevent or minimize damage resulting from disasters (either man made or natural) and help a museum recover.\\" The required elements of such a plan are as follows: tailored to the institutions current facilities and specific circumstances, covers all threats/risks relevant to the institution, addresses staff, visitors, structures, and collections, includes evacuation plans for people, specifies how to protect, evacuate or recover collections in the event of a disaster, and delegates responsibility for implementation. A Photography Conservator would have a vital role to play in the emergency response plan at their institution. It would be their responsibility to detail the needs of the photography collection and the ways to recover that collection in case of a disaster. It is widely recommended that the staff partake in monthly training to go over the emergency response plan in order to ensure that each staff member, including the photograph conservator, knows their role in case of an emergency. = Examination and documentation = Examination is defined by the act of looking at something closely and carefully or a close and careful study of something. This would be a crucial duty for all conservators, including Photograph Conservators. Barbara Appelbaum explains that \\"the contrast between the first impression of an object-which is more or less the impression of the ordinary viewer- and the view that a conservator takes during an examination is a significant one.\\" The first step of an examination is examination of an object with one's eye with a bright light, sometimes with the help of magnification or other viewing aids like binoculars. Tactile observations are also critical, and in some cases senses of smell and hearing yield useful information as well, as tapping on a glass plate negative for example can help identify significant discontinuities. It can be argued that documentation is the most important task a conservator carries out. Every step of the process must be fully documented by a conservator. The National Park Service recommends that all conservation treatment should be documented in writing. They should also include visual representations such as photographs, drawings, analytical results, spectra, and digital images. The documentation should be kept in hard copy and in digital files appended to the Collections Database System used by the museum. Documentation is important for the following reasons * Conservation documentation is a written and visual report of the work that is done. It provides the park staff with detailed information on the condition of the object, including how it has been altered, what parts are composed of original material, and what has been added or removed during previous treatments or restorations. * It serves as a permanent record of the treatment procedures performed and the materials and methods used. * It spells out the understanding reached between the curatorial staff and the conservator on the treatment, including the extent and type of any stabilization or restoration treatment. * It provides information that will help future conservators to assess the condition of an object and devise further treatment. * It makes it possible to assess the success or failure of treatment methods and materials over a long period of time. * It may last longer than the object itself and become the only record. = Research = Photograph conservators must do thorough research before any treatment can take place. This is often the legacy that conservators leave behind, their documentation, research, and treatment. New techniques and less harsh treatments are being discovered all the time by professionals in the field. The Getty Conservation Institute is currently researching methods for characterization of photographs and photographic material. The study is explained as, \\"both qualitative and quantitative analysis of photographs and photographic material in order to facilitate identification of photographic processes, and to develop a quantitative methodology for analysis of photographic material. The analytical techniques currently being used in this research are: * X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) * Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) * Enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) * inductively coupled plasmas mass spectrometry (ICP‚ÄìMS) * environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) * neutron activation analysis (NAA)\\" = Treatment = Treatment is defined by the American Institute for Conservation as, \\"the deliberate alteration of the chemical and/or physical aspects of cultural property, aimed primarily at prolonging its existence. Treatment may consist of stabilization and/or restoration.\\" Stabilization is meant to maintain the integrity of cultural property and minimize deterioration and restoration is meant to return cultural property to a known or assumed state, often through addition of non original material. Treating photographs is not all about the aesthetic of the image, it also has to do with the photographs long term survival. Of course a photographs conservator would want the image to look as pleasing as possible, but that is not the primary motive behind conservation treatment. Photograph preservation is concerned with treating original photographic material and not the digital copy of that image, although making reproductions of images digitally is a treatment plan used by many conservators. This allows digital photograph restoration and study and preservation of the image and information that image contains, without the original being damaged further. However this is not a replacement for the original photograph as digital scans and copies can easily become obsolete. A successful treatment was carried out on a broken glass plate interpositive of Abraham Lincoln taken in 1860, at the George Eastman House. This treatment included using materials that stabilized the glass and emulsion and involved research in innovative new methods.  Skills and knowledge  Photograph conservators need to possess a vast knowledge of photographic processes and deterioration of those materials. Conservators should have experience in: * examination procedures to determine the materials, method of manufacture, and properties of objects or structures and the causes and extent of deterioration or alteration * scientific analysis and research to identify historic and artistic methods and materials of fabrication, and to evaluate the efficacy and appropriateness of materials and procedures of conservation * documentation procedures to record the condition of an object or site at a specific time, or before, during, and after treatment, and to outline treatment methods and materials in detail * treatment, including interventive procedures, as well as passive measures to stabilize an artifact or retard its deterioration * restoration to bring a deteriorated or damaged object or structure closer to a previous or assumed appearance or function * advising on procedures for the safe exhibition and travel of cultural materials. James B Duke House, where the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University is housed.  Education  Paths to becoming a conservator vary but usually include, a graduate degree in conservation or historic preservation with a certificate in or diploma in conservation as well as post graduate fellowships. Study of a foreign language, formal course work in drawing, painting, photography etc., professional experience, and a personal interview and portfolio are sometimes required. A few PhD programs do exist for those that wish to further their studies of conservation sciences. Some programs in North America include: * Buffalo State College * Fleming College * NYU/IFA * Queens University * Winterthur/University of Delaware  Well known photograph conservators and projects  Some of the most well known Photograph Conservators in the world are: * Paul Messier who received his Masters of Arts and certificate of advanced study in the conservation of works on paper and photographs from the art conservation program at the State University of New York College at Buffalo. He is an independent conservator of photographs in Boston, MA and founded his own studio there in 1994. Paul was recently appointed head of the newly formed Lens Media Lab at Yale University. * Gawain Weaver who received a B.A. in Art History and Chemistry from Sonoma State University, and an M.A. in Art History and diploma in Conservation from the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. He now resides in Northern California where he teaches, consults, and works as a photograph conservator. Gawain Weaver is a Professional Associate of the American Institute for Conservation and abides by the AIC Code of Ethics. * Katharine Whitman who received her bachelor's degrees in biology from Michigan State University and fine art photography from the University of Oregon. She earned her master's degree in paper conservation at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario in 2005.

The mainmorte system allowed a lord to inherit all the property of a peasant who died childless. This caused the estates of the lords to grow larger and larger. Both peasants and lords had little incentives to invest in agricultural or industrial improvements.  Course  In 1720, Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia, the duke of Savoy, had financial problems. To increase his income, he expropriated all estates held by lords who could not produce title to their lands. Subsequently, he began levying taxes on the nobility. These were the first steps in reducing the power of the feudal lords. His son Charles Emmanuel III continued his reforms, and in 1762 he abolished all mainmorte on the royal estates and personal mainmorte on private estates. In 1771 he also abolished real-estate mainmorte on private estates. In this year he also declared that all duties of peasants towards their lords could be redeemed on terms to be set by negotiation between peasant and seigneur. If no agreement was reached, the duke himself would set the terms. This provision gave leverage to the peasants. Negotiations were long and slow, but by 1792, when the French Revolution came to Savoy, all estates had been at least partially emancipated. At 1793, the Revolutionary Government of France declared full emancipation with no further redemption price.

Closely modelled after the Royal Thai Police (RTP) Police Aerial Resupply Unit (PARU) commandos and similar in function to the later South Vietnamese National Police Field Force, the DNC was active during the early phase of the Laotian Civil War from 1960 to 1965. Origins The history of the DNC began in the late 1950s when Major general Phoumi Nosavan, the Defense Minister and Strongman of the Kingdom of Laos at the time, appointed his aide de camp Lieutenant colonel Siho Lamphouthacoul Director of National Coordination (French: Directeur de la Coordination Nationale);Steiglitz, In a Little Kingdom (1990), p. 96. the exact date of this appointment is uncertain, though it certainly took place in either late 1958 or early 1959.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War (1995), pp. 25; 27, note 45; 105-106. When Maj. Gen. Phoumi was deposed by Captain Kong Le's coup in August 1960, it seems not to have curtailed Lt. Col. Siho's power nor the growth of his Directorate of National Coordination. In September of that year, he raised and trained to paramilitary standards two special counter-insurgency battalions (French: Bataillons Speciales ‚Äì BS) within the Royal Lao Police (French: Police Royale Laoti√®nne ‚Äì PRL), 11 and 33 BS, which were gathered into an incomplete regiment designated 1st Special Mobile Group (French: Groupement Mobile Speciale 1 ‚Äì GMS 1).Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War (1995), p. 105. The DNC in the Laotian civil war =Early GMS 1 operations= The new unit soon became involved in Laos' domestic politics during the turbulent period of the early 1960s, with its commander Lt. Col. Siho actively conspiring in Maj. Gen. Phoumi Nosavan's return to power. On 17 November 1960, while acting as Maj. Gen. Phoumi's intelligence officer, he contacted a U.S. Special Forces (USSF) unit, Team Ipsen. Four river gunboats of the Laotian Navy (French: Marine Laoti√®nne) were positioned in the Mekong River at Ban Sot to block Maj. Gen. Phoumi's troops advance northwards from Savannakhet towards Vientiane. On 19 November, Siho and USSF Team Ipsen set up an ambush for the Laotian Navy gunboats. However, before the boats could show up to spring it, Maj. Gen. Phoumi launched his counter-coup with a combined airborne and amphibious assault on Vientiane. Siho and his GMS 1 battalions boarded Laotian Navy landing crafts in Savannakhet on 21 November to participate in the retaking of Vientiane from Kong Le's rebel Neutralist airborne units.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War (1995), p. 37. When Maj. Gen. Phoumi's forces finally reached the Laotian capital, Siho and his paratroopers led the assault on the city. On the last day of the Battle of Vientiane, December 16, GMS 1 successfully captured the Laotian Aviation (French: Aviation Laoti√®nne) military runway at Wattay Airfield.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War (1995), p. 41.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 17. =Creation of the DNC= When Kong Le and his rebel paratroopers withdrew from Vientiane after Phoumi's coup succeeded, one of the prisoners they took with them was the head of the National Police.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War (1995), p. 46, note 39. For his actions during the December 1960 countercoup, Lt. Col. Siho was rewarded with a promotion to Brigadier general and given command of a new paramilitary security organization:Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75 (1989), p. 39. in March 1961 the GMS 1 was combined with Laotian National Army or ANL (military intelligence, psychological warfare, and military police units) and PRL (the civil police force and the immigration service) units to form the DNC.Anthony and Sexton, The War in Northern Laos (1993), p. 98, note 54. Answering only to Maj. Gen. Phoumi, Brig. Gen. Siho and its new security agency quickly took over police duties in Vientiane, exercising near absolute authority in the capital city and began screening the civilian population for Pathet Lao elements and stragglers, which often led to abuses.Sananikone, The Royal Lao Army and U.S. Army advice and support (1981), pp. 72-73. Brig. Gen. Siho's actions cost funding from the U.S. for police training; however, his GMS 1 was considered the most effective paramilitary unit in the Royal Lao Armed Forces (French: Forces Arm√©es du Royaume ‚Äì FAR),Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War (1995), pp. 105-106. and through Siho's influence, they were the first unit in the PRL and FAR to be completely outfitted with the U.S. automatic M-2 carbine. =DNC operations 1961-1964= The now airborne-qualified GMS 1 was soon put to test in April 1961, when they were sent north to prevent Kong Le's Neutralist Armed Forces (French: Forces Arm√©es Neutralistes ‚Äì FAN) troops and their Pathet Lao communist allies from moving down from the Plain of Jars and recapturing Vientiane. On 25 April, they were deployed on the southern bank of the Lik River (Lao language: Nam Lik), successfully blocking the only paved road leading to the capital, Route 13.Anthony and Sexton, The War in Northern Laos (1993), p. 51.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War (1995), p. 54. During the following year a 30-man contingent was sent to Thailand to attend Airborne and Commando courses manned by Royal Thai Police (RTP) instructors from the Police Aerial Resupply Unit (PARU) at their Camp Narusuan training facilities located near Hua Hin in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province. Upon their return they formed the cadre of a new special battalion, 99 BS, which enabled GMS 1 to attain full regimental strength. A DNC training depot and an airborne course were established at Phone Kheng in Vientiane, where 11, 33, and 99 BS were all given parachute training.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), pp. 17-18. Involvement in illicit activities Once the threat to Vientiane had passed, the DNC settled into a low-level struggle with the Royal Lao Army (RLA) for control of the Vientiane vice trade, with Siho and Kouprasith constantly skirmishing over the corrupt prerequisites of power. Both Generals wanted payoffs for allowing gambling, opium dealing, smuggling, and the importation of essential medicines.Kuzmarov, Modernizing Repression (2012), p. 131. Although originally intended to be used in intelligence-gathering and Commando operations and rated as the most capable military unit in Laos, the GMS was primarily kept in Vientiane to support Siho's illicit activities.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 18. In reality, the GMS served principally as Siho's personal bodyguard, gaining a reputation among the civilian populace for both corruption in police duties and military ability as para-commandos.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War (1995), p. 113, note 1. One source refers to them as \\"gangsters\\" involved in prostitution, gambling, extortion, sabotage, kidnapping, torture, and political repression.Kuzmarov, Modernizing Repression (2012), pp. 130-131. On 5 November 1961, Brig. Gen. Siho's DNC personnel arrested a FAN intelligence officer who was on business in Vientiane; the detainee was released two days later.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War (1995), p. 97. Later on November 29, a DNC unit began irregular operations near Thakhek in the Military Region 3 (Savannakhet).Ahern, Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos (2006), pp. 109-110. However, this action came to an abrupt end in December when Siho's demands for tactical control of the operation through the communications network was refused.Ahern, Undercover Armies: CIA and Surrogate Warfare in Laos (2006), p. 111, note 51. In 1963 Brig. Gen. Siho appointed Lieutenant colonel Thao Ty as his replacement at the head of the GMS 1 para- commando regiment.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75 (1989), p. 46, Plate G1. Siho‚Äôs coup attempt In February 1964 GMS 1 was brought down to Savannakhet in Military Region 3 to recapture the village of Nong Boua Lao held by Pathet Lao guerrilla forces, which had already repelled several assaults by the RLA. Although the three para battalions successfully assaulted the village, they were withdrawn to conduct yet another coup d'√©tat in VientianeConboy and Morrison, Shadow War (1995), p. 106. (however, another source states that the GMS battalions were actually withdrawn before they could reach their objective). On 17 April 1964 the Kingdom of Laos Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma made the decision to enter negotiations with the Pathet Lao leader, his communist brother Prince Souphanouvong on the Plain of Jars. Upon learning this, Brig. Gen. Siho decided to take matters into its own hands and stage a pre-emptive coup d'√©tat. The following day, DNC police units seized the capital's public infrastructure and took control of the country.Castle, At War in the Shadow of Vietnam (1993), p. 64. However, the coup of 18 April 1964 was short-lived, as Brig. Gen. Siho received international criticism and was quickly outranked by Major-General Kouprasith Abhay, who succeeded in being nominated Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the RLA, whilst his ally Major-General Ouane Rattikone became the Commander-in-Chief. In response, Siho changed the GMS designation to Border Police (French: Police de Frontiers), and kept a low profile.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War (1995), p. 123.Anthony and Sexton, The War in Northern Laos (1993), p. 119. The August 1964 coup Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Phoumi's powers were so diminished that he was allowed little input into the successful Operation Triangle of July 1964. However, Phoumi evaded the agreement that ended the 18 April coup, which deprived him of troops to command. He still led a full-strength training battalion in the capital, as well as the cadre for a second, and had a couple of \\"economic battalions\\" of RLA veterans at his disposal stationed at Thakhek and Pakse. On 4 August 1964, Phoumi unleashed his training battalion in a new coup attempt. The trainees erected roadblocks throughout Vientiane, but they were promptly crushed by Kouprasith's troops as Siho's DNC sat out the fight.Anthony and Sexton, The War in Northern Laos (1993), pp. 119; 125. In December 1964, Brig. Gen. Siho detained the socially prominent editor of a Vientiane newspaper, sparking widespread outrage from the military. The DNC and the Royal Lao Army were poised for an armed clash. However, King Sisavang Vatthana was coincidentally in town, and interceded to defuse the situation. =Disbandement= On 1 February 1965 the DNC, which had held de facto control over Vientiane during the previous year, was defeated in yet another coup d'√©tat led by Maj. Gen. Kouprasith, who adroitly kept Brig. Gen. Siho from committing the Border Police to action. Despite their non-participation in any of the January 1965 coup activities, a company of BS 33 guarding the Border Police headquarters at Muong Phene was overrun by RLA regular troops supported by M24 Chaffee light tanks, M8 Greyhound light armored cars, and M116 75mm towed field howitzers, and dispersed on 3 February 1965. The other two Border Police battalions ‚Äì BS 11 and BS 99 ‚Äì remained entrenched at their camp in Phou Khao Khouai outside Vientiane and initially refused to surrender. Meanwhile, the DNC's General Headquarters and training depot complex at Phone Kheng was destroyed by tank and artillery fire, being subsequently demolished to make room for the new FAR Headquarters building.Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954‚Äì1975 (1994), p. 18. A subsequent ground assault upon the Phou Khao Khouai camp went unresisted, and with the exception of a single company from BS 11, these two battalions were arrested and disarmed. However, the following day, the two remaining companies of BS 33 made a futile raid upon the capital, only to be cornered and subdued. Meanwhile, Brig. Gen. Siho crossed the Mekong River to exile in Thailand;Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War (1995), pp. 124-125. his DNC 'empire' was quickly divided and its units were disbanded: the military intelligence, psychological warfare, and military police personnel were returned to the RLA structure whilst some of the policemen were kept in service and renamed the National Police Corps, which was assigned to the Ministry of the Interior of the Royal Lao Government. After two days of negotiations, the three former Border Police Battalions and their commander, Lt. Col. Thao Ty agreed to lay down their arms with the option of transferring to the RLA's airborne forces command. By mid-year they had been moved to Seno, near Savannakhet, and consolidated into a new parachute regiment, Airborne Mobile Group 21 (French: Groupement Mobile 21 Aeroport√©e ‚Äì GM 21) under Thao Ty's command. Structure and organization By early April 1964, DNC's total strength peaked at 6,500 officers and enlisted men; GMS members were all airborne-qualified volunteers, organized into three special battalions, BS 33, BS 11, and BS 99. Each battalion comprised one headquarters (HQ), three company HQ sections, and three Commando companies. The DNC's Command Staff was headquartered at Phone Kheng in the north-eastern outskirts of Vientiane,Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954‚Äì1975 (1994), p. 18. whilst the GMS was initially based in Ban Y Lai, north of Vientiane,Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 19. but after becoming Border Police its headquarters was moved to Muong Phene, also in the outskirts of the capital city. With exception of a single company tasked of guarding the unit HQ, its three paratrooper battalions were permanently based at Phou Khao Khouai, a military camp located 22 kilometers (13.67 miles) north of the capital.

Service headgear consisted on a badgeless black beret worn American-style, pulled to the right ‚Äì in contrast to the FAR, where berets were still being worn pulled to the left in typical French fashion ‚Äì reflecting the influence of the training cadres received from the Thai PARU in 1962; in the field, the beret was often replaced by a US M-1C jump helmet. Regulation footwear were the calf-length French M1950 or M1950/53 TAP (French: Bottes de saut mod√©le 1950 et 1950/53) black leather jump-boot models and the US Army M-1962 \\"McNamara\\" black leather combat boots. Web gear was a mix of US M-1945 and M-1956 Load-Carrying Equipments (LCE), respectively in khaki and Olive Green cotton canvas and standard issue in the FAR.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75 (1989), p. 15. Unlike the FAR, the GMS and DNC never developed a distinctive unit insignia nor a beret badge, and even rank insignia was seldom seen on uniforms; a commemorative embroidered red round patch edged black bearing a tiger surmounted by the Laotian inscription \\"Revolutionary Forces\\" (Lao language: ‡∫Å‡∫≥ ‡∫•‡∫±‡∫á‡∫õ‡∫∞‡∫ï‡∫¥‡∫ß‡∫±‡∫î  kam lang pativad), which celebrated Siho's recapture of Vientiane in 1960, was worn on the left shoulder. In 1962 the DNC adopted a distinctive set of gold parachute wings in three classes modelled after the PARU airborne qualification badge, which were worn above the right pocket of the fatigue shirt.

Ceracchi also created many replicas, in both marble and plaster. The bust was later used as a model for sculptures and paintings. History Ceracchi created a terracotta model of Hamilton, from life, about 1791‚Äì92. This was subsequently sent to Rome, where he created the marble version. As written to Hamilton in July 1792, Ceracchi was \\"impatient to receive the clay that I had the satisfaction of forming from your witty and significant physiognomy\\". He returned to deliver the bust to Hamilton in 1794. He did not receive payment until later. On March 3, 1796, Hamilton wrote in his cash-book: \\"for this sum through delicacy paid upon cherachi‚Äôs draft for making my bust on his own importunity & as a favour to him $620\\" The Hamilton family kept the bust until 1896 when it was bequeathed to the New York Public Library along with the portrait painting of George Washington, The Constable-Hamilton Portrait, by Gilbert Stuart. Both were sold together, as requested by the will, on November 30, 2005 to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art for over $8 million. A copy of the bust is now housed at Hamilton Grange, in New York City. The original is displayed at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. Description Ceracchi portrayed Hamilton in the style of a Roman Senator, with wavy hair and bare-chested, wearing a ribbon of the Order of the Cincinnati over his right shoulder. Inscription The original work is inscribed on the back in Latin: {  } This translates to \\"Executed in Philadelphia and copied in Florence, Executed by Joseph Ceracchi, 1794.\\" Legacy The painter John Trumbull used the bust as model for a series of 1804‚Äì1808 portraits of Hamilton. The first U.S. Postal Service stamp to honor Hamilton was an 1870 30-cent stamp using this bust as a model. In 1880, the bust owned by Hamilton's son, John C. Hamilton, was used as a model for the head of the granite statue by Carl Conrads. At the Hamilton Grange National Memorial, the National Park Service has installed a touch-screen display that features an avatar modeled after Ceracchi's bust. While Ceracchi (born on July 4, 1751) created busts for several founding fathers, his life did not end well. After returning to Europe, he first celebrated Napoleon with a bust, but then turned against him. After an unsuccessful plot, Napoleon had him guillotined at the Place de Gr√®ve on January 30, 1801.

Online banking, e-ticketing for air travelling, share trading in stock exchange are few examples of e-commerce of modern advancement. With its potential, e-trading can reduce the cost per transaction, increase efficiency, support contest, lower prices and boost international demand. It can open new areas for business in the service sector like on-line education, medical services, consultancy, and data exchange. It can also provide expansion in trade through domestic and international market research, advertising and marketing. In the financial services area, it can make easy and speedy transactions and transfer of money at a minimum risk. The interesting feature of online trading is that an investor simply sitting in his office or home can buy or sell through the Internet via mobile/tablet or PC and before being an experienced trader he may learn a lot by watching market screens or web portals at his convenience. Electronic trading under e-commerce The term e-trading (or electronic trading) covers a series of systems ranging from simple order transmission service to full-fledged trade execution. e-trade is location neutral and is scale able that mainly provides electronic order executed from users to the system owned by the seller or manufacturer. Electronically distribution of offer with provision of transaction details i.e. description of offer, quality, cost, guarantee, validity, discounts, quantity etc. is carried out through automated trade execution. Most commonly, three categories are well recognized under e-commerce, namely: :(i) Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce: customers deal directly with the organization, avoiding any intermediaries :(ii) Business-to-business (B2B) participants are organizations :(iii) Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) participants are individuals, with one serving as the buyer and the other as the seller E-commerce is the name given to commerce activities, e.g. sale, purchase, transfer, or exchange of products, services and/or information, that are conducted using the electronic means and technologies. However, in the general sense e-commerce is simply referred to online transactions. Sometimes the terms e-commerce and e-business are used interchangeably but they are distinct concepts involving three and four integrations respectively. E-business is more difficult as compared to e-commerce. The E-marketplace is one of the forms of e-commerce organizations with online trading and online shopping, where buyers and sellers meet to exchange goods, services, money or information or any consideration thereof. E-commerce in Pakistan' was first started in 2001. With the ban of PayPal services in Pakistan, eCommerce business companies and merchants had to rely on cash on delivery, and bank payment methods. There was no dedicated online payment service operating in Pakistan, which was also not favorable for online buyers in Pakistan. However, the need was fulfilled to an extent with the launch of mobile payment systems in Pakistan. In October 2009, Telenor launched \\"Easypaisa\\" Mobile Account Service through which users could pay bills, transfer money domestically, internationally and even can save money in their Easy Paisa Mobile Account. Scope of e-trading and e-governance Asad Ali Shah, former provincial minister, speaking as a chief guest at a Student Seminar organized by Department of Computer Science of Sindh Madressatul Islam University on ‚ÄúFuture of E-Commerce in Pakistan‚Äù stated that E-governance is essential for effective governance and administration, and in Pakistan besides e-commerce, m-commerce means business through mobile technology is also growing rapidly, that is giving boost to our economic and commercial activities in Pakistan. In his speech Dr Muhammad Ali Shaikh, Vice Chancellor of Sindh Madressatul Islam said that e-commerce is a future of the country. Earlier Pakistan had witnessed two big revolutions; one was of telecommunication and second was of satellite television channels that have changed the old Pakistani society. Now e-commerce is getting its roots in the society, but there are also some obstacles in its way, that must be removed, he added. There is a lot of scope of E-commerce in Pakistan, and most companies(of all categories) are moving to the digital world, The study found that 84% of the organizations have an internet account. Survey statistics reveal that 59% of the organizations have either an in-house or vendor supported Web server and 67% of the surveyed organization have homepage. =Obstacles to e-business= Major obstacles in the way of e-commerce growth in Pakistan are: *(i) low literacy rate in the society, as most parts of the country particularly rural areas are lacking education. *(ii) shortage of power (huge gap between demand and supply of electricity due to insufficient production) Online trading With the introduction of information technology (IT) e-commerce is producing new fast-growing areas like online buying and selling of financial instrument e.g. shares of public or private limited companies over the Internet including sale purchase of commodities, currencies, and gold. With the introduction of the World Wide Web, almost all transactions can be carried out using a computer or mobile phone through proprietary software.

Investment and finance Shares trading in stock exchange can provide reward and investment in stocks may increase in value besides paying dividends to its investor. Shareholder receives rewards when the company performs well and the value of shares goes up. But if the company does poorly, the share price falls down and the value of an investment will be reduced.

Although there are many foreign workers and Saudi citizens belonging to the Ahmadiyya movement in Saudi Arabia, Ahmadis are officially banned from entering the country and from performing the pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. This has led to criticisms from multiple human rights organizations. History From the very early history of the Ahmadiyya Movement in the late 19th century, Ahmadis have had contact with the region in what were then a host of Ottoman provinces in the Arabian peninsula, primarily due to their spiritual connection to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The first Arab Ahmadi from the region, according to Ahmadiyya historical records, was Sheikh Muhammad bin Ahmad al-Makki, a resident of Shi'b 'Amir in the city of Mecca. Upon visiting India in 1891 and hearing of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and his claim, he initially wrote an invective letter to him but upon meeting with him at Ludhiana, pledged his allegiance to Ghulam Ahmad and joined the Ahmadiyya movement. He remained for some time at Qadian before returning to Mecca in 1893 and maintained correspondence with Ghulam Ahmad requesting him to send some literature so as to distribute in Mecca. In response Ghulam Ahmad authored the book HamƒÅmat-ul-Bushra (The Dove of Glad Tidings) in Arabic and sent it to Mecca. Other literature also seems to have been sent to Arabia. Another individual by the name of Uthman a resident of Ta'if, is registered in Ahmadiyya records as having pledged allegiance to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, but nothing much is known of him except his name and residence. Both of these persons were also included by Ghulam Ahmad in a list of 313 of his companions. In September 1912, Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad, the eldest son of Ghulam Ahmad, travelled to the Hejaz, with Mir Nasir Nawab ‚Äì his maternal grandfather, and Sayyid Abdul Hayyi Arab ‚Äì a companion of Ghulam Ahmad, and performed the Hajj pilgrimage. This was before he became the second Khalifa of the Ahmadiyya movement in 1914, succeeding his predecessor Hakeem Noor-ud-Din, the first Khalifa. Noor-ud-Din had himself lived in the Hejaz for some years in the late 1860s in pursuit of religious learning, approximately 20 years before the birth of the movement. Modern status There are no accurate figures for the number of Ahmadis in Saudi Arabia. However, Ahmadi Muslims are a small community, primarily foreign workers from India and Pakistan and some from other countries. There is an increasing number of Saudi citizens who belong to the movement. Since the Ahmadiyya faith is banned in the country, there are no Ahmadi mosques. Ahmadis generally gather together in private properties for their daily prayers, thereby limiting exposure to the local authorities. In a 2006‚Äì2007 nationwide campaign to track down and deport Ahmadi Muslim foreign workers, the Saudi religious police arrested 56‚Äì60Depending on the source there were 56‚Äì60 Ahmadis arrested in the years 2006‚Äì2007 Ahmadi Muslims of Indian, Pakistani and Syrian origin from major cities across the country. In late December 2006, several dozen Saudi police raided a private guest house in Jeddah in Western Saudi Arabia, and detained 49 Ahmadi Muslims, including women, children and infants. A fortnight later, in early January 2007, the police arrested 5 Ahmadis from major industrial cities of Jubail and Dammam in the Eastern Province. The police failed to arrest the leader of the movement in Dammam, because he was out of the country at the time. In February of the same year, two more Ahmadi guest workers were arrested from the capital of the country Riyadh, in central Saudi Arabia. The arrests came under the orders of Minister of Interior Prince Nayef, and targeted Ahmadis solely because of their faith. Despite calls from international human rights groups, by April 2007, 58 Ahmadi Muslims were deported to their country of origin. In May 2012, Saudi authorities arrested two Saudi citizens because of their conversion to the Ahmadiyya movement. Saudi officials encouraged them to abandon their beliefs, and three months later, they were detained. They have not been released since then. =Pilgrimage= Although Ahmadi Muslims are not openly permitted to enter the holy cities of Mecca or Medina by law, there are reportedly many Ahmadis who do perform Hajj and Umrah, the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. Pakistan raises an additional barrier to performing Hajj. It requires that all Muslims applying for a passport must denigrate the founder of the community, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, and declare that all Ahmadis are non-Muslims. Although Ahmadis believe in the finality of prophethood in Muhammad, as the last law bearing Prophet who can bring any new law or religion, they hold Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as the promised Messiah and Imam Mahdi who Muhammad prophesied to appear within the latter days; these views are controversial in the Muslim world.

Historical background The word \\"Ombudsman\\" has Swedish roots and the literal translation means ‚Äúgrievance person‚Äù. This word in its modern meaning was first used by the Swedish parliament in the 19th century when establishing the office of justitieombudsman. This office was responsible for defending the citizens when they had issues with the government. In 1697 the Swedish King, Charles XII, dedicated his first 17 years of his governance to wars, hence was mainly out of the country. During this period he established an office called the King's Highest Ombudsman. The main job of the office was to confirm and consistently check that all the governmental workers were acting according to the king's rules, while he was away from Sweden. However this office was closed when the king returned. Human rights defenders operate all over the world. Independent of whether the state is stable or not due to internal conflicts, non-democratic one or has a strong democratic practice, economically developing or not, the defenders role in a country is always crucial. They seek to promote and protect human rights in the context of a variety of challenges, including HIV/AIDS, development, migration, structural adjustment policies and political transition.

Restrictions and Limitations The Human Rights Defender of Armenia shall be guided only by the Constitution and the Laws of the Republic of Armenia, as well as norms and principles of International Law.

Famous cases =Ombudsman strongly condemns any case of violence against human rights activists= On the sixteenth of April with profound misgiving we gain from our Rapid Response group in Lori marz, that the human rights activists of Helsinki Citizens' Assembly Vanadzor Office had been assaulted. As per the declaration of the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly Vanadzor Office a few subjects, who were against screening of Azerbaijani movies, tossed stones towards the human rights association's office, ill-used, harmed the property and even hurt one of the officers. Savagery towards any individual is unequivocally censured, and brutality towards persons with exceptional mission including human rights shields and writers is over and again denounced. Savagery towards human rights guards and writers is a wrongdoing, as well as disgrace and disgrace for the general public. It would be more disgraceful if such activities don't get a sufficient open response, and law authorization bodies don't completely secure human rights protectors and rebuff the liable with all the strictness of the law. I am against screening of Azerbaijani movies in Armenia, particularly in the current circumstance, when Azerbaijani riflemen execute our siblings on the fringe, when Azerbaijan shows scorn towards us all over the place, specifically Azerbaijani President's late wild indication that stunned and disturbed numerous Europeans. We see ourselves as Europeans. Our goals are unequivocally situated towards Europe. Our Christian and national qualities have dependably driven us towards resilience and humanism. A genuine Christian, an accommodating Armenian, an advanced European can't express his difference by tossing stones. A law authorization body with a Christian philosophy, drove in its activities by sacred qualities and the letter of law, can't stay detached in such inadmissible case and shun brief uncovering and rebuffing the liable of the wrongdoing submitted. =RA Human Rights Defender Preliminary Observations on the Presidential Elections 2013= Dear Citizens, Each election is always followed by certain results and various assessments. Above the actual election results much more important is the public's confidence in regards to those results. Public's confidence can be formed only by neutral and objective assessments. From today on many local and international organizations will present their assessments on these elections. Nonetheless, no rating can be full and reliable for the Armenian society, if the Armenian Police doesn't present objectively on how many calls related to the following serious electoral violations were and how many of them were valid: Voting bribes, Double voting, Directed voting, Ballot stuffing, Committee member or proxy's pressure during the calculation of votes Falsification of results of vote counting Moreover, the Police should also publicize basis and reasons for considering those calls valid or invalid. Also is essential to find out urgently and to inform the society on why the Gala TV website activities were disrupted during the Election Day. It's also crucial to find out all the cases of journalist and observers activity obstacles and to take to responsibility the guilty ones. Not credible activity of the RA Police may obscure positive achievements of all the phases of these Elections. Hence, the RA Policy is responsible to carry the heavy burden of the public's reliability on the Elections results and of the Elections‚Äô general assessment. I urge all the institutions and individuals to cooperate with the Police, in order to swiftly and efficiently reveal all the electoral crimes and for the society to receive the actual picture and amount of the electoral violations. On the abovementioned essential and other electoral violations the Human Rights Defender received 253 calls. Before presenting our comprehensive assessment on the elections we will continue receiving calls on the electoral violations during the election different stages, follow relevant publications of mass media, assessments of the observer organizations and post-electoral developments.

Early life Eidinger was born in Pittsburgh in 1973, to a pro-union Democratic family. While at Taylor Allderdice High School, was an Eagle Scout and student council president, and successfully campaigned to have foam trays removed from the lunchroom. He attended American University, majoring in communications (1992‚Äì1996), and there organized protests against tuition increases and school president Benjamin Ladner, who was a decade later removed in 2005 for abuse of school funds. Eidinger also served on the school's debate team and cofounded the school's frisbee club, and was arrested for streaking. It was during his first year at American University that Eidinger first tried marijuana, shaping his later political actions. Business activities =Publicist= Eidinger initially worked for Rabinowitz Media Strategies following graduation, where he was later fired for his involvement in protest against the IMF, to which some of his employer's clients happened to be tied. In 2000, he founded Mintwood Media Collective, which managed publicity for Dr. Bronner's Soap; Mintwood was retained by Dr. Bronner's in 2001, when the Drug Enforcement Administration was attempting to prevent the importation of hemp, used in Bronner's soap. Mintwood Media closed in 2013 and was reformed as Mintwood Strategies, a sole proprietorship of Eidinger. That year, Movement Media took over publicity duties for Dr. Bronner's. =Capitol Hemp= Eidinger is co-owner of Capitol Hemp, a store he opened in 2008 in Adams Morgan, selling industrial hemp products such as clothing, food, and shoes. The store and its Chinatown branch were raided by Metropolitan police in October 2011 on charges of selling drug paraphernalia; police arrested Eidinger, five employees, and a customer. Eidinger and his business partner agreed to close the stores rather than lose $350,000 in confiscated merchandise and face criminal charges. In early 2015, following the legalization of marijuana in the District, Eidinger announced his intent to reopen Capitol Hemp at an Adams Morgan location by April of that year. Political activism Eidinger has been involved in a wide range of political actions, on District and national issues; a 2014 profile by the Washington Post stated he has been arrested 15 times. Key among his causes have been the marijuana and hemp politics, GMO labeling, anti-war, and social justice. =Cannabis= Hemp Advocacy Eidinger was the publicist for Vote Hemp and the Hemp Industries Association before opening Capitol Hemp. He has been a frequent speaker at Seattle Hempfest. He was instrumental in uncovering the diaries of USDA botanist Lyster Dewey, who grew hemp on the land that is now the Pentagon. In 2009 he was arrested along with other activists for planting hemp seeds in the front lawn of the DEA headquarters in Virginia. Medical Marijuana Eidinger was President of the non-profit organization DC Patients' Cooperative, which was founded in the Spring of 2010 and disbanded in 2012. He, his business partner from Capitol Hemp, and colleague Nikolas Schiller formed the non-profit organization to educate District residents about the medical cannabis law and to apply for a license open a cultivation center and dispensary. Unlike other for-profit groups vying for a license from the DC government, his non-profit organization was more concerned with patient access and affordability. Over the course of the next two years, he helped organize town hall meetings and press conferences to educate the public and urge the District government to move forward with the long-delayed program. The DC Patients' Cooperative ultimately did not apply for a cultivation center or dispensary license because the DC government required applicants to sign a form admitting they were violating federal law. He said the organization decided it wanted nothing to do with a program \\"that treats us like criminals.\\" Initiative 71 for marijuana legalization A canvasser for the DC Cannabis Campaign soliciting signatures for Initiative 71 In an interview with the Washington Post, Eidinger attributed his inspiration to legalize marijuana to his experiences in the 2011 raids on Capitol Hemp. In early 2013 Eidinger formed the DCMJ organization to press for decriminalization of marijuana in the District; after seeing no movement from the city council, he submitted initial paperwork for a decriminalization ballot initiative, which was rejected by the city on technical budgetary grounds. Eidinger then refined his initiative, but strengthened it to call for full legalization of marijuana. The DC Cannabis Campaign's Initiative 71 was approved by the District in April 2014, and went on to gather over 55,000 signatures by the July deadline, assuring the initiative's place on the ballot. The initiative ultimately succeeded, winning with approximately 70% of the vote in the 2014 mayoral election. When Congress attempted to block action on the initiative as part of budget negotiations in 2015, Eidinger led protests in the capital, blocking traffic on Massachusetts Avenue. Following Initiative 71's taking effect at 12:01 on 26 February 2015, Eidinger publicly smoked a joint and planted hemp seeds before a gathering of national and international press in his home, which also served as campaign headquarters. In March 2015, Mayor Muriel Bowser granted DC license plate number \\"420\\" to Eidinger.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/03/13/d-c-mayor- offers-special-420-license-plate-to-pot-activist/ Cannabis protests On 20 April 2017, Eidinger and six other activists were arrested by U.S. Capitol police, during a public event where they handed out free cannabis cigarettes to anyone with a Congressional ID badge.http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/20/420-dc-pot-activists- arrested-during-free-marijuan/ Less than a week later, Eidinger was arrested again by Capitol Police on 24 April, along with three other activists, during a \\"smoke-in\\" protest on Capitol Hill.http://www.thecannabist.co/2017/04/24/washington-dc-marijuana-protest-us- capitol-arrests-april-24/78275/ Relocation to Maryland In April, 2018, Eidinger rented a home in Salisbury, Maryland in order to help unseat prohibitionist congressman Andy Harris. =IMF and World Bank= In 2002, Eidinger, a protest leader, was among over 400 people arrested at Pershing Park during a protest against the IMF and World Bank; he was one of seven of those who in 2005 successfully sued the city for wrongful arrest, leading to a $425,000 collective settlement and changes to police procedures. Eidinger had previously been visited by DC police who warned him against his plans for a poster campaign in support of the IMF protests, which he alleged was intimidation. =GMO labeling= Eidinger has been active in the campaign to label foods with genetically modified ingredients. He was a lead organizer for the Right2Know March, a 300-mile march from Brooklyn to Washington, DC, which took place October 1 to October 16, 2011. At Barack Obama's second inauguration he worked with the activist group Occupy Monsanto to distribute 50 pounds of organic carrots in order to remind the president about his pledge to label genetically modified foods. In the summer of 2013, he organized a nationwide tour of art cars with giant transgenic fish sculptures attached to the roof. The car Fishy Sugar Beet ultimately won Car Talk's World Ugliest Car award. =Monsanto= Eidinger has been vocal critic of the Monsanto Company and purchased 75 shares to facilitate shareholder activism. In the summer of 2013, he submitted a shareholder resolution written by his colleague Nikolas Schiller, which requested the company issue a report on GMO labeling and the inclusion of Monsanto's patent numbers on food labels. At the 2014 Monsanto shareholder meeting, while his shareholder resolution was being discussed, Eidinger and other activists from Occupy Monsanto blockaded the entrance to Monsanto's campus with the art cars and was arrested. The shareholder resolution ultimately failed, receiving 4.16% of the votes. During the 2013 government shutdown, he joined activists from Occupy Monsanto and visited the offices of various members of Congress to distribute the fictitious Monsanto Minion Awards. After the awards were distributed, he joined activists who dumped $2,000 from the balcony of the Hart Senate Office Building and was arrested. =Shadow Representative runs= In 2002 and 2004 he ran as the DC Statehood Green Party candidate for the District of Columbia's Shadow Representative, which is an unpaid position that lobbies Congress to support DC statehood. In 2002 he received 13.9% of the vote and in 2004 he received 12.8% of the vote. =Other= Eidinger's other protest activities include coordinating the Justice Action Movement in a protest of the inauguration of George W. Bush in 2001, and protests against the District's deal to build a new stadium for the Washington Nationals, where he jumped onto the stage during a press event to announce the team's new name and logo, and seized a microphone to shout \\"this is a bad deal, people\\" before being tackled.

Since its establishment in 1995, the IAA has become a unique database on planning and building in Palestine and Israel from the late 19th century to the present. The IAA is located in the basement of the Shalom Mayer Tower, as a symbolic statement, as the tower was built on the site of the first Hebrew public building in Tel Aviv, the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium (established 1909). The demolition of the latter in 1959 was a landmark event in Hebrew culture that drew awareness to the need for preservation and documentation of the recent past. History of the collection The Herzeliya Hebrew Gymnasium, ca. 1930, later demolished to make place for the tower in which the IAA resides. The IAA was initially conceived as a private collection by Zvi Elhyani, an architect and architectural historian, while still a student at the Architecture Department at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, Jerusalem in the mid-1990s. The collection expanded significantly during Elhyani's graduate studies (MSc Arch. and PhD) at the Faculty of Architecture and Town Planning at the Technion, Haifa. Over the years, the IAA collection became established, garnering increasing publicity and reputation. It consists of hundreds of thousands of items which continuously accumulate, collected from a variety of sources: active acquisition and purchase of relevant collections and single items, absorption of collections and items from owners, etc. As such, the IAA functions as a primary address for historical and rare materials which otherwise would have been lost and entirely disappeared. Since most other attempts to establish a central archive for building and architecture in Israel have failed, the IAA has become a storage place for documentary materials for architects and demolished and existing buildings which not only enfold chapters in the history of Israeli architecture, but also in its nation-building.

The line northwards ran to Tillynaught where it split to reach Banff by a branch line or Elgin by the Moray Coast line. Barry was opened in 1859 by the Banff, Portsoy and Strathisla Railway, and in 1867 was absorbed by the GNoSR who took over the line, closed 'Barry' in 1863, reopening it as 'Glenbarry' in 1872 and then operating it until grouping in 1923.

Notable projects include Empty Bottles (2007), Tokyo Tokyo (2010) and This Land is Your Land, This Land is My Land (2012). They also worked as editors and curators on The Chinese Photobook (2015). Thijs groot Wassink lives in London while Ruben Lundgren lives in Beijing. Career The duo met at the Utrecht School of the Arts from whose photography department they graduated in 2005. Their first collaborative publication Is Still Searching was given away, but not until the duo had torn out the pages that were no longer relevant to them at that moment. Their next publication Empty Bottles (2007) won the Prix du Livre for Best Contemporary Photobook at Rencontres d'Arles and is included in The Photobook: A History Volume III by Martin Parr and Gerry Badger. From 2007 to 2008 Thijs groot Wassink studied Fine Arts (MA) at Central Saint Martins in London.

In their series This Land is Your Land, This Land is My Land (2012) they document the most expensive part of the Netherlands, the financial district called the Zuidas. By doing so, they challenge our expectations of land, value, and the value of land. Their work is often described as playful and inventive.

The General Offensive of 1 March 1949 () was a military offensive during the Indonesian National Revolution.  Background  Frustrated at negotiations with the Republic and believing it weakened by both the Darul Islam and Madiun insurgencies, the Dutch launched a military offensive on 19 December 1948 which it termed 'Operatie Kraai' (Operation Crow). By the following day it had conquered the city of Yogyakarta, the location of the temporary Republican capital. By the end of December, all major Republican held cities in Java and Sumatra were in Dutch hands. The Republican President, Vice-President, and all but six Republic of Indonesia ministers were captured by Dutch troops and exiled on Bangka Island off the east coast of Sumatra. In areas surrounding Yogyakarta and Surakarta, Republican forces refused to surrender and continued to wage a guerrilla war under the leadership of Republican military chief of staff General Sudirman who had escaped the Dutch offensives. An emergency Republican government, the Pemerintahan Darurat Republik Indonesia (PDRI), was established in West Sumatra.  The offensive  In early 1949, Hamengkubuwono IX conceived the idea of a major offensive to be launched against Yogyakarta and the Dutch troops occupying it. The purpose of this offensive was to show to the world that Indonesia still existed and that it was not ready to surrender. The idea was suggested to General Sudirman, the Commander of the Indonesian Army and received his approval. In February 1949, Hamengkubuwono IX had a meeting with then Lieutenant Colonel Suharto, the man chosen by Sudirman to be the field commander for the offensive. After this discussion, preparations were made for the offensive. This involved intensified guerilla attacks in villages and towns around Yogyakarta so as to make the Dutch station more troops outside of Yogyakarta and thin the numbers in the city itself. On 1 March 1949 at 6 AM, Suharto and his troops launched the 1 March General Offensive. The offensive caught the Dutch by surprise. For his part, Hamengkubuwono IX allowed his palace to be used as a hide out for the troops. For six hours, Indonesian troops maintained control of Yogyakarta before finally retreating. The offensive failed in its attempt to show the world that the Indonesian army still existed. Not much attention was paid to it by the United Nations. The United Nations observers mentioned Dutch had successfully repelled the attacks.  Aftermath  The United Nations already adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 63 on 24 December 1948, in response to a report by the Committee of Good Offices the Council called upon the parties to cease hostilities and to release the President of the Republic of Indonesia and other political prisoners arrested since 18 December 1948. On 29 June 1949 Yogyakarta was cleared from Dutch forces under the pressure from the United Nations. Legacy In later years, after Suharto became second president of Indonesia, The offensive, later known in Indonesia as Serangan Oemoem (new spelling: Serangan Umum, 'General Offensive'), raised myth of Suharto as national hero by retaking the city from the Dutch for six hours. The offensive also commemorated by a large monument in Yogyakarta. The \\"Six hours in Yogyakarta\\" are celebrated every 1 March with parades all over the city and other celebrations.

The resource privilege exists regardless of how the rulers came to power. While bribery is often illegal, the purchase of these resources by payment to the current government in control is legal. Corrupt leaders sell these resources to generate revenue which entrenches the corrupt government and incentivizing the seizure of power itself. This further handicaps the ability to achieve democracy along with hindering economic growth and the eradication of poverty.  Cause  Some academics argue that International Resource Privilege remains because arrangements between global institutions tend to be struck without adequate concern for their thoroughgoing effects on the global poor. One example is that it provides additional incentive to overthrowing governments, which in turn contributes to a cycle of political instability where a promising government might just as soon be toppled as a brutal military regime. There is little incentive for foreign governments to challenge the situation because they benefit from it. The Washington Post quotes Thomas Pogge as saying ‚Äúmost of us do not merely let people starve, but also participate in starving them.‚Äù We elect officials that let the corporations buy the natural resources that should belong to the people is the argument for why we are involved. For example oil wealth and dictatorship go together as seen in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. This international economic and political system perpetuates and reproduces poverty in such that western nations have a negative duty not to do harm to the people of these nations.  Example  ExxonMobil is the largest exporter from Equatorial Guinea, Exxon pays Teodoro Obiang and his family for the oil rights. Simon Taylor, director of Global Witness said he is \\"A dictator who has impoverished his citizens and enriched himself and his family by plundering the country's oil wealth\\" Which leads us to the thought of \\"What are our moral obligations to these people?\\", are we responsible for their poverty and human rights violations? Thomas Pogge argues that we are.  Philosophical Response  Mathias Risse calls the resource and borrowing privilege \\"The Cosmopolitan Complaint\\". He does acknowledge that the global order provides incentives for it but attributes oppression to the sheer desire to rule. Risse rejects the belief that the global order Pogge is referring to is shaped by the \\"sheer existence of states\\" but Pogge rejects this idea also.

Red currant (Ribes rubrum), engraving after a painting by Henriette Vincent, 1820. Early life Henriette Antoinette Rideau du Sal was born in Brest, France, in May 1786. Her father, Marcel-Henry Rideau du Sal, was a naval chief commissioner, while her mother was a descendant of St. Malo corsairs. In August 1803, shortly after her father's death, she married Ambroise Mery Vincent (1776-1863), a local marine engineer who was working for the port of Brest's naval artillery service and to whom she had given lessons. The following year, they had a son, Aristide Vincent (1804‚Äì1879), who as an adult became a businessman, farmer, and Fourierist journalist in Brest. On Ambroise's marriage, his family settled property in the nearby town of Roscanvel on him, and he built some kilns on this land because he had ambitions to get into the ceramics and brickmaking business. He abandoned this ambition to help support his wife's career as a painter. They moved to Paris, where he got a job as superintendent of the gardens at the future Empress Josephine's residence, Ch√¢teau de Malmaison, just outside the city. By 1814, he would rise to be superintendent of imperial buildings in Compi√®gne, a job lost he almost immediately when Napoleon abdicated his throne the following year. Within a decade, he had recovered his fortunes sufficiently to be able to buy the former Land√©vennec Abbey near Brest, and he turned to property management, with mixed results. Education and career Henriette studied painting in Paris with Gerard van Spaendonck and Pierre-Joseph Redout√©, both of whom were noted flower painters and French court artists. Redout√© in particular spent much time painting the roses and other flowers in the garden at Malmaison during the reign of Napoleon. Under their tutelage, she developed into an exceptional artist who rivaled Redout√© in her handling of color. She worked professionally under her married name of Henriette Vincent, sometimes styling herself \\"Madame Vincent\\" (not to be confused with the painter Ad√©la√Øde Labille-Guiard, who is also sometimes referred to under that title). Her connection with Redout√© led to a number of opportunities for commissioned work, and she was able to exhibit her work in the Paris Salon in 1814, 1819, 1822, and 1824. These accomplishments were rare for women artists of the period, who had few opportunities to gain the kind of advanced training that would lead to commissions and allow them to become self-supporting. Henriette Vincent's magnum opus was Studies of Flowers and Fruits Painted from Life (original title: √âtudes de fleurs et de fruits: Peints d'apr√®s nature). First published in Paris in 1820 with 48 hand-finished color engravings by Lambert the elder, it was republished the same year in London with hand-colored aquatints by T.L. Busby that reversed the images in the original volume. It was dedicated to \\"young women\\", presumably those who might follow in Madame Vincent's footsteps. The subjects of the watercolors included common flowers like tulips, pinks, narcissus, hyacinths, carnations, and anemones; the fruits depicted included grapes, cherries, plums, and strawberries. The finely detailed, naturalistic images typically show clusters of flowers and fruits with their leaves against a plain background and may be further particularized by such details as water droplets, a ladybug sitting on a leaf, or butterflies flitting nearby. Although not notable for scientific exactitude, Vincent's paintings continue to be appreciated as masterpieces of delicacy and beauty from the heyday of the florilegium. Only five copies of the book are now known to exist; institutions holding copies include the British Museum and the Chicago Botanic Garden. In 1831, Madame Vincent retired to the Land√©vennec Abbey, and she died there a few years later, in 1834, not yet out of her forties. In 1835, a second, posthumous volume of her work was published: A Collection of 24 Flower Bouquets (Collection de 24 Bouquets de Fleurs). The bouquets featured two to five different kinds of flowers, some in a loose bunch and others in vases or bowls. The plates were stipple engravings (again produced by Lambert) in full color with extensive hand finishing. Stippling, which Madame Vincent probably learned from her teacher Redout√© who was renowned for using this dotted technique, is well suited to representing the texture of flowers but poses extra challenges to the engraving process. The book, which is a comparatively small volume of 11 x 8.25 inches, has been praised as of \\"such consummate loveliness\\" that it enhances the overall reputation of French floral painters of the era. Madame Vincent's work was included in the 2013 show \\"The Feminine Perspective: Women Artists and Illustrators\\" organized by the Lenhardt Library of the Chicago Botanic Garden.

The Battle of Allenstein, also known as the Battle of Inkowo was a military engagement during the early stages of the 1807 Fourth Coalition Napoleonic campaign in Poland. While the battle resulted in a French field victory and allowed for a successful pursuit of the Russian army, it failed to produce the decisive engagement that Napoleon was seeking. Context After crushing the Prussian forces in 1806, Napoleon and his Grande Arm√©e advanced east into the Polish provinces of Prussia, with the aim of bringing the Russian there army to give decisive battle. However, the arrival of winter led the Emperor to order his army to winter quarters, thinking that the Russians will do the same. In order to exploit this misapprehension, the Russian commander, Levin August, Count von Bennigsen decided to take the initiative and, towards the end of January set his troops in motion to attack the weak French left, crush it and fall behind the French army.Hourtoulle 2007, p. 45. Quite fortuitously, the French of Michel Ney's Corps, who had disobeyed orders and overextended his foraging array, encountered the Russian advance guard. Thus Napoleon was able to read into Bennigsen's intentions and set up what was supposed to be the decisive manoeuvre of the campaign. Ordering his left wing to fall back in order to pull in the Russian army westwards, the Emperor directed the bulk of his forces northwards, towards Allenstein, in a bid to outflank the unsuspecting enemy and fall behind it with superior forces. As chance would have it, the Russians intercepted a crucial dispatch, in which the Chief of Staff, Louis Alexandre Berthier, was explaining the entire plan to the commander of the left wing corps, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. This allowed Bennigsen to realize the mortal danger in which his army lay and begin a precipitated retreat northeast. Battle Meanwhile, oblivious of the Russian retreat, the French pursued their intended manoeuvre, pushing their advance guard, elements of the Reserve Cavalry Corps of Joachim Murat, supported by Jean-de-Dieu Soult's Corps, towards the Alle river. On February 3, these troops arrived at Allenstein and the Inkowo plateau, where they discovered a portion of the retreating Russian army. Seeing an opportunity for a major battle, Napoleon ordered four more army corps to march to the battlefield. He detailed Murat to delay his attack in order to wait for reinforcements and, as soon as these reached the battlefield, attack the Russians frontally using Louis-Vincent- Joseph Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire's division, while Soult would march to flank the enemy. On the Russian side, General Nikolay Kamensky was forced to accept battle rather than retreat, in order to protect the strategic Liebstadt road and the bridges over the Alle, which were key for the successful retreat of the rest of the army. He was helped in his task by the fact the French only attacked towards 15:00 hours, a delay caused by Napoleon's orders to Murat. When the French eventually attacked, the Russians were prepared and used their fifteen cannon and musketry to inflict heavy losses to the advancing enemy. Nevertheless, the Russian tactical disposition, defending a defil√© rather than occupying high ground, soon forced them to give ground under the pressure. Towards the end of the afternoon, Soult, with the 24th Light and 4th Line regiments began his flanking attack and, after some ferocious combat, pushed the Russians beyond the Alle, capturing an intact Bergfried bridge. With night falling and his position completely compromised, Bennigsen decided to hasten his retreat and ordered Kamensky to extricate his force and withdraw to Deppen. Both sides suffered relatively high losses, with the Russians forced to abandon six cannon and three hundred prisoners on the field of battle. Result Despite this tactical success, Napoleon failed to bring the Russians to give decisive battle, requiring a further exhausting wintertime pursuit. Nevertheless, the French did capture the intact strategic bridges over the Alle, which the Russians omitted to blow up.Tulard 1999, p. 68. French pursuit resumed the next day, resulting the capture of sixteen cannon, while the day after Soult captured no less than 1200 prisoners. A series of skirmishes led to the Battle of Hoff on February 6, followed by the Battle of Eylau, one of the bloodiest engagements of the entire Napoleonic Wars.

A return visit was made in 1975, at which time tools of stone and bone, pottery fragments, and remains of toolmaking (debitage) were recovered. The site underwent a significant excavation in 1978, led by a local school teacher, whose collection is now in the Robert Abbe Museum of Stone Antiquities in Bar Harbor. Among the thousands of objects recovered from the site there are stone and bone tools, pottery fragments, and projectile points. The site resembles the Goddard Site in Brooklin as a multi-component site, and offers the potential to reveal a great deal about human occupation of the area over a significant time period. The site is significant regionally as a particularly fine multicomponent site, including the early Moorehead phase (also known as the Red Paint People, c. 4000 BC), the subsequent Susquehanna Tradition, and the Early to Late Ceramic periods (extending from about 2500 BC to 500 CE).

Bright spots detected by the Venus Monitoring Camera on the European Space Agency's Venus Express in the area suggest that there may be active volcanism on Venus. Magellan spacecraft by NASA. Modified after Dinderman (2015). Introduction Ganis Chasma consists of a group of rift zones located in the Ganiki Planitia Quadrangle on Venus. A chasma is defined as a long, narrow, steep sided depression on a planet. These depressions, or canyons, formed as a result of extensional tectonics due to volcanism. Ganis Chasma is associated with volcanism of Sapas Mons, a coronae feature located in the Alta Regio region of Venus. The rifts that make up Ganis Chasma formed in the shape of an arc along the edge of Sapas Mons, orientated in a north‚Äìsouth direction. Little is known about ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. So far, no volcanic activity has been determined to have occurred in the last two million years. In 2008 and 2009 images taken by the Venus Monitoring Camera on the European Space Agency's (ESA) Venus Express (VEx) in eight observational sessions detected four bright transient spots along the edges of Ganis Chasma. In 2014, this was interpreted by Eugene Shalygin and his colleagues as active hotspot volcanism. The team suggests that transient bright spots observed in several consequent images of Ganis Chasma is the first direct evidence of current volcanic activity on Venus. Ganiki Planitia Quadrangle Location of the Ganiki Planitia Quadrangle Ganis Chasma is located in the Ganiki Planitia Quadrangle. This quadrangle is positioned between two volcanic regions on Venus. To the north lies the Atlanta Planitia lowland which was formed as the result of mantle upwelling and downwelling. To the south lies Alta Regio. This region is a major volcanic rise and was formed as the result of mantle upwelling. The Ganiki Planitia Quadrangle was strongly influenced by mantle flow tectonics derived from these two regions. The area contains many volcanic, tectonic, and impact features. Ganis Chasma is one of the extensional features located in the region. Other features include grabens, troughs and lineaments. Chains of pit craters located throughout the Ganiki Planitia Quadrangle have been found to influence the formation and deformation of these extensional features. Tectonics Ganis Chasma was formed due to extension associated with volcanism in Alta Regio. It formed in the shape of an arc around the Sapas Mons, a corona feature associated with Alta Regio. There are two types of rift structures on Venus, rifts (or chasmata), and fracture belts. Ganis Chasma is younger than other chasmata on Venus, as evidenced by the lack of associated wrinkle ridges. Ganis Chasma has undergone additional deformation due to pit crater chains that induced fracturing along the rift zone. Possible volcanic activity Locations of observed transient bright spots on Ganis Chasma, Venus. Modified from Shalygin (2014) Previous studies have been conducted in search of current volcanic activity on Venus. These include observing increases in the amount of sulfur dioxide, a gas emitted by volcanoes, in Venus's upper atmosphere as well as observing possible lava flows emitting heat on Venus's surface. While these studies indicate presence of past volcanic activity, none could prove any volcanism occurring in the past 2 million years. In 2008 and 2009 images retrieved by the VEx Venus Monitoring Camera using a near infrared one micron filter indicated several transient bright spots located in Ganis Chasma along the edges of the rift zone. In 2014, these transient bright spots were interpreted by Eugene Shalyin and his colleagues as possible active hotspot volcanism. Shalygin and his team created mosaics of the images of the study area and created maps of relative surface brightness. They interpreted these bright spots as hot matter at or just above the surface due to the result of a process that releases hot matter such as lava or gas (volcanism). If this claim can be substantiated, it would be the first direct evidence of current volcanic activity on Venus.

He was best known as the photographer for Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks (including the covers for her first two albums, Bella Donna and The Wild Heart). It was his photograph that was run on the cover of the Fleetwood Mac Rumours album and was instrumental in creating the iconic imagery (like the crystal ball) that is still associated with Fleetwood Mac today. He photographed over 40 covers for several bands and artists, including Buddy Miles, Paris, Jesse Cutlerhttp://www.discogs.com/Jesse-Cutler-Jesse- Cutler/release/4949195 20/20http://www.discogs.com/2020-2020/release/1213210 and Lita Ford, among many others, in his 30+ years as a rock music photographer.  Career  Worthington grew up in South Los Angeles, and in the 1960s he started associating with the music scene. Later, in the early 1970s, while living with his friend Buddy Miles, a friend gave him a camera and Worthington's brother helped show him how to use it. Living and working with Buddy Miles, Worthington got to know other musicians, such as Steve Winwood, Sly Stone and Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix became a very close friend, and Worthington would end up traveling with Hendrix on several shows in 1969. While living with Buddy Miles, Worthington notes it was Ron Raffaelli, personal photographer of Jimi Hendrix, who taught him about photography. Worthington became well known for his photography as he became even more involved in the entertainment industry.  Final years and death  Worthington had an antique store, \\"House of Worthington,\\" in Los Angeles, on La Brea, selling gothic furniture and antiques. In 2007, Worthington had a website \\"Herbert W. Worthington\\", in which he sold Stevie Nicks posters, calendars, prints and T-shirts.

Facts Mr Smith claimed his dismissal from the Glasgow City District Council‚Äôs Building and Works Department, after three complaints, and a majority decision by a special committee that he had to go, was unfair. A letter to him had set out three reasons that (i) he unduly expanded the workforce (ii) he failed to respond to legitimate requests (iii) he was irresponsible in not getting written instructions before spending money on expanding and recruiting. The Tribunal found the second complaint was unfounded, but the dismissal was fair in any case. The EAT dismissed the appeal. The Inner House of the Court of Session held that the committee wrongly took the second complaint into consideration and so the dismissal had to be unfair. The council appealed. Judgment Lord Mackay held the dismissal was unfair. First, the employer failed to show the principal reason for dismissal because it did not distinguish among the three complaints. Second, the employer relied upon the second complaint as part of the principal reason for dismissal. He said that a tribunal cannot impute a reason to the employer‚Äôs dismissal which it did not have at the time of dismissal. Lord Keith, Lord Brandon, Lord Ackner and Lord Oliver concurred.

The Ministry of the Attorney General has established the International Law and Human Rights Unit to ensure adherence to these principles.  Gender equality  Section 4 of the Constitution prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex. In 2014, Trinidad and Tobago ranked 49th on the Global Gender Gap Index of the World Economic Forum, with a score of 0.715, down from its 36th place in 2013. In terms of participation in the labor force, the country ranked 87th, with 59% of women participating as opposed to 82% of men. Women on average received 66% of men's wages for similar work, constituted 29% of the parliament and occupied 6% of ministerial positions. The Gender Affairs Division of the Ministry of Gender, Youth and Child Development is committed to bettering the situation in the country, with the National Gender and Development Policy at the stage of finalization since 2011 as of 2014. In 2010, the country had its first female prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar. Violence against women, however, is on the rise, with 689 cases of sexual offenses reported in 2013, with an increase of 200 cases since 2011. According to the US Secretary of State, the government and nongovernmental organizations reported that many incidents of rape and other sexual crimes were unreported, partly due to perceived insensitivity of police, exacerbated by a wide cultural acceptance of gender-based violence. There is a lack of reliable statistics, but women's groups stated in 2013 that over 50% of the country's women suffered abuse. Many community leaders asserted that abuse of women, particularly in the form of domestic violence, continued to be a significant problem.  Freedoms  = Freedom of the press = In 2014, Reporters Without Borders, in its Press Freedom Index, placed Trinidad and Tobago at the 43rd place, with a score of 23.28, corresponding to a \\"satisfactory situation\\". In the same year, Freedom House classified Trinidad and Tobago as \\"free\\" in terms of press freedom, which is the highest level available. There were cases brought against journalists for libel in 2012, but no such cases occurred in 2013 and efforts were made to exempt investigative journalists from such charges. There were reportedly occasional attempts to influence the press by the politicians, for instance, three senior journalists resigned in the Trinidad Guardian to protest alleged governmental interference and the prime minister publicly criticized the press. There was also an alleged governmental \\"smear campaign\\" against two journalists who had investigated the activities of the national security minister and the Attorney General. However, there are active political weekly newspapers and all of the daily and weekly newspapers are privately owned, with no restrictions on access to the Internet. = Freedom of religion = The freedom of religion in Trinidad and Tobago is protected by both domestic legal framework and international conventions, namely Section 4 of the Constitution, protecting the \\"freedom of conscience and religious belief and observance\\" and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. According to the United States Secretary of State Report 2013, members of the government often participated in the ceremonies and holidays of various religious groups, regularly emphasizing religious tolerance and harmony, and government officials routinely spoke publicly against religious intolerance. The prime minister, for example, participated in religious holiday events during Ramadan, Diwali, Eid-al-Fitr, Easter, and Corpus Christi, and issued corresponding public statements underscoring religious freedom as a deeply held national value. There were no reports of discrimination based on religious beliefs or affiliation.  Human trafficking  According to the US Secretary of State, as of 2013, Trinidad and Tobago is a destination, transit, and possible source country for adults and children subjected to sex trafficking and adults subjected to forced labor. Women and girls from the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Venezuela, and Colombia were reportedly subjected to sex trafficking in Trinidadian brothels and clubs. Economic migrants from the Caribbean region and from Asia, including India and China, are vulnerable to forced labor. Cases of forced labor have occurred in domestic service and in the retail sector. Law enforcement officials report Trinidadian children were vulnerable to sex trafficking and forced labor, including the coerced selling of drugs. A 2013 study indicated individuals in establishments, such as brothels or nightclubs, throughout Trinidad recruit women and girls for the commercial sex trade and keep their passports; withholding a passport is a common indicator of human trafficking. This report also revealed that economic migrants who lack legal status may be exposed to various forms of exploitation and abuse, which are indicative of human trafficking. According to the American report, while the government did not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, there was significant progress; during the reporting period, the government vigorously investigated trafficking offenses and, for the first time, formally charged suspected trafficking offenders under its 2011 anti-trafficking law. The cases of human trafficking were also confirmed by Trinidadian officials. There were 42 reported cases of human trafficking between 2007 and 2013, but this was not believed to reflect the extent of the problem fully. There were no officially documented cases of trafficking of children.

From an early age he was a close friend of Edward Atkinson Hornel and would often bring in New Year with him in Kirkcudbright. Within the architectural profession, he was closest to John Archibald Campbell, and is credited with training Charles Rennie Mackintosh.  Biography  The imposing red sandstone offices of the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company on Govan Road, which from 2013, will form the Fairfield Heritage Centre. Keppie was born in Glasgow, the fourth son of John Keppie, a wealthy tobacco importer and Helen Cuthbertson Hopkins. Articled, in 1880, to Campbell Douglas and Sellars, he attended classes at both University of Glasgow and the Glasgow School of Art. Three of his siblings including Jessie Keppie also studied art. He also appears to have enrolled at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1885, remaining there until 1886. An accomplished draughtsman, he won silver medals in the Tite Prize competitions of 1886 and 1887. He assisted Sellars with the firm's winning entry for the Glasgow International Exhibition of 1888. Following Sellars death in 1888, Keppie went into partnership with John Honeyman, establishing the firm Honeyman and Keppie. Mackintosh joined the firm in 1889 and from the 1890s Keppie appears to have been content to allow him to do most of the designing. It was whilst working for Honeyman and Keppie, who won the competition to design the new Art School building in 1896, that Mackintosh designed his greatest achievement.Terry, S. (2013) Glasgow Almanac: An A-Z of the City and its People Neil Wilson Publishing. Retrieved March 2015 His design for Martyrs' Public School was also executed during this time (1895-1898). Mackintosh was made partner in 1901, and Keppie returned to design, producing a series of Scots Renaissance buildings throughout Glasgow. He was admitted to the FRIBA in 1904. The partnership with Mackintosh dissolved in 1913. The following year the company won a major competition for the reconstruction of Glasgow Cross. Keppie was elected to the Royal Scottish Academy in 1920, and continued to take an active role in professional matters, particularly as a governor of the Glasgow School of Art. He had been Deacon of the Incorporation of Wrights at the Trades House in 1906 and president of the Glasgow Institute of Architects in 1905, and again in 1919-20. He endowed the John Honeyman Studentships in architecture and in Sculpture in 1923, and did much to promote the career of Benno Schotz. He was president of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland in 1924-26; and as a Council Member of the RIBA he became its vice president in 1929. Keppie's long service as a governor of Glasgow School of Art ended in his chairmanship in 1930-32. He formally retired in 1937.Oxford Paperbacks (2006) A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture page 413 Oxford University Press. Retrieved March 2015 Keppie never married.

Two years after the British had conquered the Chin Hills, he led a rebellion to overthrow the British administration from Chin Hills. Unsuccessful in his rebellion, Khai Kam was sentenced to life imprisonment on the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean. He was released in 1910 and returned to the Chin Hills.  Early youth  Khai Kam was the son of Sizang chief Pu Khup Pau and Pi Cing Niang. He was born in 1864 at Khuasak, Tedim Township.  British invasion of Chin Hills (1888-1889)  The Kingdom of Burma fell under the British rule in 1885 and Kale-Kabaw valley, bordering the Chin Hills became the British territory. The British had several meetings with the Chin tribal leaders to discuss the recognition of British authority, the issue of raiding made by the Chin to the plains and to open a trade route linking Burma to India. The negotiation failed as the Chin made several raid in to the plains, defying the British. The Tashon, the most powerful tribe in Chin Hill at that time, also harbored the Shwe Gyo Phyu prince and his followers who rebelled the British in central Burma. Ultimatum was sent to the Sizang chief to deliver Khai Kam together with the captives whom he carried off . Ultimatum was also sent to the Tashon council to deliver the Shwe Gyo Phyu prince and his followers. When the ultimatums were ignored, the British made preparation to invade the Chin Hills. = Preparation for the expedition of 1888-1889 = The British spent the month of November 1888 preparing for the expedition. Brigadier-General Faunce and Captain Raikes, established defensive positions long the valley. A levy of Military Police (later 2nd Battalion of Burma Rifle) guarded the Yaw valley against the depredations of the Southern Chins. Capt. Raikes and his assistant Mr. Hall collecting intelligence about the Chin, their village and the routes into the hills. Hills coolies were collected in Assam and sent for the expeditions. The forces for expedition were gathered at Kanpale (Stockade No.1) and Gurkha 42nd Battalion was added for the expeditions. = Strategy for invading Chin Hills = The strategy was to first march against the Sizang head village, Khuasak then deal with the surrounding villages. The route selected for the advance of the column was from Kanpale to the summit of Leisan range. There were no road to the hills at that time, therefore, a road had to be constructed for the main invading force and their heavy weaponry. At the beginning of December 1888, the road construction was completed until the foot of the hill, there they established No.2 Stockade i.e. Zawlkin/Khai Kam village. The road construction continued towards the hills and the reach at Phatzang where a rough No.3 stockade was established. = The Chins Offensive = The Chin learned about the invasion and made necessary preparation themselves. The Sizang council sent Khai Kam of Khuasak to meet Khawcin (the chief of Kamhau) at Tedim. The next day a force consisting of 1,200 (Sizang), 400 (Kamhau) and 30 (Sukte) prepared to defend their motherland. At Khuasak, the Chin warriors were feasted by slaughtering a mithun. The Tashon also gathered warriors from her powerful neighbouring tribes. On 7 December 1888, the Sizang started their offensive by attacking the road construction party, wounding Lt.Palmer. Lt.Palmer later died on that wound. On 24 December, the Sizang again attacked the road working party and killed a sepoy of 2nd Gurkha. On Christmas Day, the combined forces of Sizang, Kamhau an Sukte attacked on the working party under the direction of Lt. Butcher of 42nd Gurkha Bn. The Sizang were in constant co-ordination with the Tashons. On 10 December 1888, the great force of Tashon made a simultaneous attack on the villages of Sihaung, Kyawywa and Kundu. At the same time, 80 Tashon warriors clashed head to head with 42nd Gurkha Light infantry led by Capt. Westmoreland. On the same date, the Sizang attacked Indin (Sawbwa‚Äôs capital) and a combined force of Sokte and Kamhau attacked the military post at Kangyi (20miles north of Kalemyo). The Chins showed their planning abilities and military capabilities in this simultaneous attack to the various British positions. The British officers were impressed by the Chin capabilities as political officers Mr.Carey and Mr.Tuck wrote: \\"The Chins were in great force, and we now know that Tashons and Siyins (Sizang) were fighting side by side on this occasion. The Chins swooped down from the heights on to the party, which was working on a narrow spur, and attacked them from all four sides, fighting under cover of heavy undergrowth. The collies bolted and the troops fell back after holding their ground some little time. Whilst disputing every stage of our advance into their hills, the Chins showed considerable tactical ability by taking the offensive in the plains and attacking Shan villages and our posts in the rear of advancing column\\". = Chin Hills Expedition (1888-1889) = Since, the Chin showed their military skills by inflicting some losses on the invading forces, the British Army have now taken the Chin seriously. Field Marshal Sir George Stuart White Commander-in-Chief of Burma, personally came to supervise the expeditions. He arrived in Kanpale on 30 December 1888 and accompanied the expedition forces. On 27 January 1889, the road workers were again attacked by the Chin. The workers were sent back to the No.3 Stockade and the British troops engaged with the Chin. The Chin made them very resistance but the British troops managed to push the Chin back slowly towards the hills until they reached heavily fortified position at Leisanmual (Red Rocky Gate). The Chin stood firm at Leisanmual stockade which was a formidable and skillfully placed stockade. The stockade was also the last defensive line for the Chin. Attempts were made to overcome the stockade but, a stubborn resistance made by the Chin made it very difficult. The British political officers Mr. Carey and Mr. Tuck noted the difficulty as ‚Äútheir routes always heavily stockade and the stockades generally held by the enemy, who never ceased to ambush when opportunity occurred, both day and night (Carey & Tuck 1896, p 28)‚Äù. The British attacking force at Leisanmual were reinforced by the 42nd Gurkha Bn led by Lt.Col Skene. Field Marshal Sir George Stuart White himself joined the force. The attack at Leisanmual was described by Field Marshal Sir George Stuart White as \\"Enemy yesterday attacked our working party on road above this and held our covering party, 40 British and 100 Gurkhas, from 9-2, when I arrived and ordered their positions to be charged. We carried all, driving them entirely away, getting off ourselves wonderfully cheaply. Only one Norfolk dangerously wounded. Enemy in considerable numbers, using many rifles and plenty ammunition. They fired at least 1000 rounds, standing resolutely until actually charged, even trying to outflank at once. 'Most difficult enemy to see or hit I ever fought'\\". The reinforcement made a difference to the battle as the British overcome the stockade. The battle at Leisenmual was a serious blow to the Sizang, realizing that it was impossible to save their villages. On 22 January, Gen.Faunce proceeded to the summit of Leisan range after several skirmishes. There they established No.4 stockade on 31 January 1889. During one of these operations a Lophei Chief Khup Lian personally fought hand to hand with a British soldier and captured a semi-automatic rifle. This was the first semi-automatic gun to reach the hands of the Chin people. He recorded this in a stone inscription which reads \\"I am the 15th generation down from the house of Thuantak who is the original progenitor of the Siyin Tribe. Being an orphan from childhood I exerted myself all alone in many enterprises by which I became a self-made man with many and various achieve-ments. When the British on 1888 undertook their first expedition against us (the Chins) I attainded the age of 20 years and I played an active part in the defence against them. When the British troops marched up the Signalling at No. 5 Stockade the united forces of the Siyins. Suktes and Kamhaus made a good resistance to the British attack which was easily repulsed. On this occasion I personally captured one rifle. When the second expedition took place in 1889 the British, too well armed to be resisted against, carried the day: hence the annexation of Chin Hills\\". (Note: This is not a full inscription) = British occupation of Sizang Valley (1889) = Before the arrival of British force at Sizang villages, Khai Kam burned his capital Khuasak then moved into the jungle. At the same time over 2,000 warriors of the Sizang, Kamhau, Sukte and Khuano were assembling at the village of Buanman. The British fired the cannonballs at Buanman and then it exploded spectacularly, thus, the Chin realized the superiority of the British force. By February 1889, the British captured Khuasak, Buanman and Thuklai where the British military post Fort White was built. The name of the Fort was in honour of Gen. Sir George White. The British then destroyed the whole of Sizang villages as British political officers Carey and Tuck reported \\"By 6th March not a single Sizang village remained in existence. The destruction of Sizang villages was accomplished with a good deal of firing, but very little damage to life and limb (Carey & Tuck 1896, P29)\\". Although, villages were burnt to ground, Khai Kam did not surrender. Instead, he moved his headquarter to Suangpi from where he continued his resistance movement against the British. They ambushed the British, they cut telegraph cables and stole cattle from the British whenever possible. The Sizang resisted the British from the forest for two years. They were constantly moving their hideout whenever the British knew their location. = British occupation of Chin Hills (1890) = In September 1889, the British northern column attacked Suangpi, Dimpi and Dimlo. The British burned Suangpi in November but instead of surrendering, Khai Kam simply moved again his headquarter to Pimpi. On 11 December, the British attacked Montok but the people resisted the British column rather than saving their burning newly built huts. The British then temporarily abandoned their attempt to defeat the Sizang, who resisted under the leadership of Khai Kam. The British then marched to subdue the Tashon who were the most powerful tribes in the whole of Chin Hills at that time. The British believed that Sizang would surrender if Tashon submitted to the British. In March 1890, the Tashon surrendered to the British, followed by the Sizang in April 1890. On the first of September 1890 Khuppau and Khai Kam of Khuasak surrendered their slaves. On that day, in a ceremony held in Thuklai, Sizang chiefs Manglun (Limkhai), Kamlam (Thuklai), Khuppau (Khuasak), Dolian (Buanman) and Khuplian (Lophei) made an oath of friendship with political officer R. S. Carey. A mithun was slaughtered for the ceremony, and its tail was dipped in the blood. Pu Kamlam took the tail of the mithun and stroked the legs of Mr. Carey, and said; \\"Let us forget our wars in the past; should you break our peace agreement, may you fall like the hairs of mithun and pigs, and should the Sizang break this peace agreement, may the Sizang fall like the hairs of mithun and pigs.\\" After the ceremony, Mr. Carey announce British recognition of the existing Sizang chiefs.  Sizang-Gungal Rebellion (1892-1894)  Since the British occupied in Chin Hills, heavy fines were imposed for any sign of rebellion, collies were demanded all over Chin Hills, disarming the Chin by confiscating their guns and freeing their slaves. The Chin people were not happy with the British conduct, as a result, several rebellions had taken place. In the Gungal area (right bank of Manipur River), Kaptel village under Chief Thuam Thawng, attacked the British outpost at Botung. Because of his action, the British demanded the surrender of Thuam Thawng. Chief Thuam Thawng did not bow to the British demands, instead of surrendering, he planned with Khai Kham to drive the British out of the Chin Hills. The Sizang chiefs (except Mang Lun of Sakhiling) held a conference and agreed unanimously to start a rebellion. This plan also got approval from Tashon, Hualngo and Zahau. Khai Kam and Thuam Thawng first decided to remove the political officers, the township officers and the Interpreters, so that there should be none left to advise and guide the British troops in Chin Hills. Thuam Tawng then invited the political officer Mr.Carey to take a fresh oath of submission. Mr.Carey had travelled to Southern Chin Hills, therefore, Maung Tun Win (Township officer), Aung Gyi and Aung Zan (interpreters) were sent for the mission. Although they were warned about Thuam Thawng and Khai Kam plan by Sakhiliang Chief Mang Lon and Kamhau Chief Do Thang, they proceeded as planned. Khai Kam and Pau Dal (son of Thuam Thawng) choose 200 warriors for rebellion. When the British delegation, Maung Tun Win, Aung Gyi and Aung Zan got to the Pumva village, they were assassinated and Sizang-Gungal rebellion was initiated. The majority of the people taking part in this rebellion were Sizang, Gungal and Sukte. The Sizang had 18 villages and all of the villages except (Vokla, Naripi & Sakhiliang) rebelled. Out of 9 Sukte villages, Dimlo and Dimpi rebelled. All of Gungal villages (10 villages) except (Mwial, Laitui and Puyan) rebelled. The plan was the Gungal and Sukte to operate in Tedim areas and the Sizang to operate in Fort White areas. The Gungal and Sukte attacked the British posts and the Sizang blocked Kalay-Sizang road, cut the telegraph wires, stole the cattle‚Äôs and destroyed the vegetation.  British operation to crush the rebellion  The British quickly learned about the rebellion and sent a large force of 2,500 rifles with two mountain guns led by Brigadier General Arthur Power Palmer to crush the rebels. In 1892 November 14, the British troop and Sizang rebels clashed at Pimpi. The Sizang burned Pimpi then fled into the jungle. By the end of 1892, the British burned all of the rebelling villages as a punishment for the rebellion. The rebellion leader Khai Kam and his followers were still largely present in the Jungle. In the early part of 1893, the British then turned their focus to Thuam Thawng‚Äôs Gungal areas. The British made a surprised attacked at Kaptel, driving Chief Thuam Thawng to Heilei. Thuam Thawng resisted the British force from Heilei stockade which was destroyed by a mountain gun. Thuam Thawng then again fled to Muizawl village. The Muizawl was also captured by the British along with Thuam Thawng and his son Pau Dal. They were sent to Kindat Jail in Myingyan where both of them died in that jail. By the end of 1893, all of the Sizang chiefs surrendered except Khai Kam and his followers. He hid in the jungle and continued fighting the British. By the end of 1893, his strength was recorded at 127 fully armed and their families all belong to Sizang and Thuklai clans. Up until this point, the rebellion was commanded by a very experienced senior commander Brigadier General Arthur Power Palmer. General Sir Arthur Power Palmer received The Companion Order of the Bath CB for his excellent services for the suppressive campaign against the Siyin-Gungal Rebellion However, unable to crush the rebellion swiftly, the British government then dispatched Major-General Richard Campbell Stewart, the Commander-in-Chief in Burma to personally supervise the rebellion. On 21 Feb 1893, the military the military situation was reported by Major General R. C Stewart follows: \\"I beg to note, for the Chief Commissioner‚Äòs information, the state of affairs in the Chin Hills, as the result of my late visit to Fort White and Hakha. Note on the state of affairs in the Chin Hills in February 1893. Military Situation: The Chief Commissioner is aware of the circumstances connected with the murder of the Myook and a portion of the escorts by the Siyins (Sizang) and Nwengals (Gungal), and subsequent telegrams and diaries have related the progress of the revolt and of the operations which were deemed necessary to suppress it. On the first outbreak of the Siyins (Sizang) on the 9th October 1892 the garrisons of Fort White was reinforced by two guns of No. 7 Bombay Mountain Battery, and 100 rifles with Headquarters, 1st Burma Battalion, under Captain Presgrave, and subsequently by 200 rifles Norfolk Regiment, under Captain Baker, which enable the offensive to be taken with vigour; and General Palmer, Commanding the Myingyan District, arrived at Fort White on the 1st December and assumed control of the operations. As the most effective way of dealing with the Siyins (Sizang), General Palmer asked for more troops, and so 300 rifles, 5th Burma Battalion under Lieutenant Taylor, and the headquarters and 400 rifles, 6th Burma Battalion, under Captain Keary, D.S.O., were added to the force. Posts were then established at Dimlo, Phunnum, and Montok; and on 2 January General Palmer with two guns, 100 rifles, Norfolk Regiment; 50 rifles, 21st Pioneers, 200 rifles, 1st Battalion; 100 rifles, 5th Burma Battalion; moved from Fort White across the Nankate [Vangteh] and on the 13th January occupied Kaptial[Kaptel], the principal and most recalcitrant village of the Nwengals. The policy throughout had been to harry the revolted tribes, and to destroy their grain supplies as much as possible. Small parties have been despatched daily from several posts to search the valley and ravines, and to hunt up Chins still lingering in the vicinity of the occupied villages. The results have been satisfactory and the tribes are being severely punished. It is difficult to estimate what their losses have been, because in all encounters with our troops the Chins have invariably been seen to carry off their wounded. On our side the losses have been extremely heavy, a total of 53 having been killed and wounded since the operations commenced. When I left Fort White General Palmer and Mr. Carey were very hopeful that both the Nwengals and the Siyins would shortly submit. Some guns had already been brought in from villages across the Nankate, and Dimlo, Pomvar and other Siyin villages were asking terms. I have every reason to hope, therefore, that full submission may shortly be expected, and I consider it a matter of congratulation that the revolt has been localised, and that the neighbouring tribes have not joined in it\\". General R C Stewart The British found traces of rebels but, they were unable to fight them in the dense Jungle. On January and February 1894, Lieutenant Sutton searched them from Leisen range and Lieutenant Mockler search them from north to south. They found a track leading to rebel hideout and several rebels were killed, captured and prisoners were taken. The British also took casualties of 1 Gurkha killed and 1 wounded. The British destroyed all the grains that they can find to starve the rebels. On 24 February the Gurkhas surprised the rebels in camp, killing and capturing several. There, the British learned that the rebels were supplied by their relatives residing in Tavak (located in the valley) and Thuklai. The British then ordered to stop trade between the Sizang and the plains. The Generals were frustrated that started to use harsh measures. Do Thang (Sukte Chief) was arrested and asked the villagers to capture the rebels in order to purchase his liberty. By the middle of 1894, only 27 rebels were left fighting the British. Pu Khai Kam  Collective punishment  The British authority were frustrated about the rebellion, they started to use dirty tactics to capture Khai Kam and his followers. They stopped all Sizang cultivations, villages were fined heavily for the conduct of rebels, whilst every Chief and village elders were made to assist the British finding the rebels. These harsh measure had significant effect as more rebels finding themselves hemmed in, therefore on 23 April 1894, 23 rebels were surrendered. The four left were Khai Kam, Khup Pau (his father), Mang Pum (his brother) and Pu Kam Suak. Although only four remained they did not surrender and continued to fight from the jungle.Because of those harsh measures, the people as a whole were suffering. The Sukte and Kamhau were anxious for the release of their Chief Do Thang whom the British promise to release only when villagers delivered Khai Kam and his followers. The Sakhiliang were also tired of the struggle. The Chin were worried that if the trade route remained close, they would all starve during the rains. However, the people were determined to hold information for Khai Kam‚Äôs family. The British then so frustrated, they arrested all the remaining male relatives of Khai Kam as hostages. Learning their relatives lives were at stake, on 16 May 1984 (1894?)Khai Kam, Khup Pau (Khai Kam father), Mang Pum (Khai Kam younger brother) and Pu Vum Lian and Pu Suang Son surrendered. They were immediately transported to Kindat jail in Myingyan District. When he was led from Thavak to the Kindat jail the locked chains opened by themselves three times but he did not attempt to flee. The guard commander was puzzled about the miraculous happening. This was the last rebellion against the British until (Hakha-Thado-Khuangli Rebellion in 1917). After the arrest, the hostages and Chief Do Thang were released and the trade route was re-opened.  Life imprisonment  Khai Kam was sentenced for life and transported to the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean. The British remarks \\"Never trust a Sizang, never allowed Khai Kam to return to Chinland\\". Khup Pau and Mang Pum got 4 years and 3 years respectively at Rangoon jail. Mang Pum later worked for the government and appealed to the British government for the release of Khai Kam.  Return to Chin Hills and death  Upon successful appeal by his brother to the British authority, Khai Kam was released on 14 May 1910 and returned to Chin Hills. When Thado-Kuku, Hakha and Khuangli rebellion happened in 1917, Khai Kam was employed by The British as an advisor during Hakha-Thado Rebellion in 1917. He died on 15 September 1919.
