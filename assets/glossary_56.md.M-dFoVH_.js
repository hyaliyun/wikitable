The film stars Rishi Kapoor, Moushumi Chatterjee, Neetu Singh, Ambareesh and Pran. It is a remake of Kanagal's own 1972 Kannada film Naagarahaavu which was based on three Kannada novels: Nagarahavu, Ondu Gandu Eradu Hennu and Sarpa Mathsara, all written by T. R. Subba Rao. The film did not do well at the box office, but the song O Hansini attained popularity.  Plot  Arjun is an ill-tempered but soft- hearted man. He always falls into in situations that others take him as a bad person. His teacher, who he calls Masterji, is the only person who understands him and appreciates his good qualities, hence Arjun follows his wishes completely. Arjun loves a woman named Aarti and wants to marry her, but Aarti's father opposes this alliance and forcibly marries her off to a man of his choice. Arjun is dejected, but soon finds love in Margaret, his Christian college mate. As time passes, he overcomes Aarti and devotes himself to Margaret. While on a business trip to another city, Arjun finds that Aarti is now a prostitute. Angered and irritated, Arjun finds himself in a pitiable state. Margaret's uncle and mother are against her marrying Arjun. Arjun and Margaret flee to the hills; Masterji catches up with them and tries to pacify Arjun, but he refuses and instead pushes him down the hill to his death. Traumatised due to killing his teacher, Arjun asks Margaret if she will join him where he goes; she says she will, and both jump to their deaths.

R. Subba Rao. Puttanna Kanagal, who directed the Kannada film, returned to direct the Hindi remake, which was produced by Virendra Sinha under Pragati Chitra International. Cinematography was handled by Sudarshan Nag, and the editing by V. P. Krishna. Ambareesh, who played a character named Jaleel in Naagarahaavu, reprised his role in Zehreela Insaan. While the character of the teacher in Naagarahaavu wore a white dhoti, black coat and Mysore turban, the same character in Zehreela Insaan wore a kurta-pyjama and a Nehru jacket. Much of the film was shot in Chitradurga, with the song \\"O Hansini\\" being shot at Chitradurga Fort.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by R. D. Burman while the lyrics were written by Majrooh Sultanpuri. The song \\"Saanp Se Badhke\\" is based on \\"Haavina Dwesha\\" from Naagarahaavu.  Release and reception  Zehreela Insaan was released on 20 November 1974, and did not succeed commercially. Rishi Kapoor later admitted it was a \\"mistake\\", feeling that he should have accepted a film similar to his earlier Bobby (1973) and not something that was \\"drastically different\\".

Lord Edward FitzGerald and Charles FitzGerald, 1st Baron Lecale, were her brothers. Through her mother she was a descendant of King Charles II. In Toulouse on 23 February 1789 Charlotte married Joseph Strutt, later Member of Parliament for Maldon and the member of an Essex family that had made their fortune from its milling business. The couple had three children: a son, John (later the second Baron Rayleigh), and two daughters. Her husband was offered a peerage for his services in the Army and Parliament but refused, and instead proposed that the honour be given to his wife.

Basil Wright (12 June 1907, Sutton, Surrey - 14 October 1987, Frieth, Buckinghamshire, England) was a documentary filmmaker, film historian, film critic and teacher. Biography After leaving Sherborne School, a well known independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset, Basil Wright was the first recruit to join John Grierson at the Empire Marketing Board's film unit in 1930, shortly after he graduated from Cambridge University. Wright's 1934 film Song of Ceylon is his most celebrated work. Shot on location in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) the film was completed with the composer Walter Leigh at the GPO Film Unit in London. At the GPO, Wright acted as producer and wrote the script for Night Mail (1936) for which he received a joint directorial credit with Harry Watt. Wright had introduced his friend W. H. Auden to the film unit and the poet's verse was included in the film. Wright left the GPO to form his own production company, The Realist Film Unit (RFU). There he directed Children at School with money from the Gas Industry and The Face of Scotland for The Films of Scotland Committee. During World War II, Wright worked only as a producer, first at John Grierson's Film Centre before joining The Crown Film Unit between 1945 and 1946 as producer-in-charge. Among the best known films he produced for Crown are Humphrey Jennings' A Diary for Timothy (1946) and A Defeated People (1946) and Instruments of the Orchestra (1946) featuring Benjamin Britten's The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra.(BBC Radio 4 \\"Tales from the Stave,\\" 2012. Returning to direction in the early 1950s, his films included Waters of Time (1951) made for the Festival of Britain, World Without End (1953) directed with Paul Rotha for UNESCO and Greece: The Immortal Land (1958) in collaboration with his friend the artist Michael Ayrton. Writing throughout the 30s and 40s, Basil Wright had contributed to the theoretical development of documentary in the movement's journals Cinema Quarterly, World Film News and Documentary Newsletter. He was the film critic for The Spectator after Graham Greene left. Wright was a regular contributor to the British Film Institute's Sight and Sound during the 1940s and '50s. He published a small book: The Uses of Film (1948) and his personal (extensive) history of cinema The Long View (1974). He taught at the University of Southern California (1962 and 1968), The National Film and Television School in London (1971‚Äì73) and Temple University in Philadelphia (1977‚Äì78). He was Governor of the British Film Institute, a fellow of the British Film Academy and President of the International Association of Documentary Filmmakers. In his films Wright combined an ability to look closely and carefully at a subject with a poetic and often experimental approach to editing and sound. In Britain he is commemorated with a film prize awarded biennially by the Royal Anthropological Institute. Centenary celebrations In honour of Basil Wright's centenary year, his career, and the careers of his colleagues and fellow centenarians: Edgar Anstey, Marion Grierson, Humphrey Jennings and Paul Rotha, were celebrated with a season of films between August and October 2007 at the British Film Institute in London. Following this season, the BFI released a four-disc DVD set Land of Promise, containing films from leading figures in the British Documentary Film movement. A further three volumes of GPO films are available from the Bfi.

It has sometimes been referred to as the Marybone Chapel or Marylebone Chapel. History The chapel was designed by James Gibbs in 1722. It was originally intended as a Chapel of Ease to supplement the parish church for the growing parish of Marylebone. It was licensed for marriages from 1722 to 1754 and between 1930 and its deconsecration: Margaret Bentinck (daughter of the 2nd Earl, and Duchess of Portland) married here. Incumbents included the theologian Frederick Maurice (1860‚Äì69), and William Boyce was the chapel's organist from 1734 to 1736. Its interior appears in plate 2 of Hogarth's print series Industry and Idleness. It was also here that the famous London French Master Chef Jassintour Rozea married his French wife Mary Magdalen Bernard in April 1744. They lived on Duke Street close to Grosvenor Square. He became Master Chef to the Duke of Somerset, Charles Seymour presenting sumptuous banquets for his guests. He wrote several cookery books on gourmet French cooking in the 1750s. Jassintour's sister Anne Rozea married Robert Gunnell (St.George's Parish, Hanover Sqr.) of the House of Commons in 1745, who later with Lord North compiled the Tax Acts that led to the American War of Independence. Plate 2 of William Hogarth's Industry and Idleness, showing the interior of the chapel In 1830, Parliament passed an \\"Act for endowing the Parish Church of Newborough in the County of Northampton, and Three Chapels, called Portland Chapel, Oxford Chapel, and Welbeck Chapel, situate in the Parish of Saint Mary-le-bone, in the County of Middlesex, and also a Chapel erected on Sunk Island in the River Humber\\". It served the congregation of All Souls Church, Langham Place, from 1940 to 1951 whilst the latter was having war damage repaired, and then became a chapel of ease to it. It is now deconsecrated and houses the London Institute for Contemporary Christianity. Architecture The church is built of brick, with stone quoins. The main entrance is at the west end, with steps leading up to a Doric porch. The pediment once held a carved coat of arms of a member of the De Vere family; this was removed in 1832, when the building was renovated and named St Peter‚Äôs. A tower rises from the ridge of the roof at the west end; the first stage is square, and of brick, while the second two stages are octagonal, and pierced on each side. At the east end is a Venetian window, with a pediment above. There was originally a stone vase on each corner of the building. Gibbs published plans of the building in his Book Of Architecture, in which it is called 'Marybone Chapel'. Its ground plan was copied at St Paul's Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia, the earliest Anglican church in Canada, and the Holy Ghost plaque in the ceiling at St Thomas' Church, Stourbridge, is a close copy of that here.

He was born in a small village named Benipur in a Bhumihar Brahmin family in the Indian state of Bihar. He had spent nine years in prison for fighting for India's independence. He was the founder of Bihar Socialist Party in 1931 and Congress Socialist Party in 1934. He served as the president of Patna District Congress Committee of Indian National Congress from 1935 to 1937 during the 1937 Indian provincial elections. He was elected as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (India) from Katra North in 1957. In 1958, he was elected as the Syndicate Member of Bihar University (Now Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar Bihar University), Muzaffarpur. Rambriksh Benipuri hailed from Muzaffarpur in Bihar and took active part in the Indian freedom movement. He was also a journalist of Hindi Literature and started several newspapers like Yuvak in 1929 and regularly contributed in various others to spread the idea of nationalism and freedom from British rule. Writing career Benipuriji's first writing was published in Pratapa of Kanpur in 1916. Since then, till the attainment of Independence of India, his was a life of political activities and struggle. In 1928‚Äì29, Benipuri established Yuvaka-Ashram in front of Patna College in Patna with his friends and lifelong colleagues Ganga Sharan Singh and Pandit Ramnandan Mishra. In 1929, Benipuri started the publication of Yuvaka, a Hindi monthly from this organization, under his editorship. Benipuri started his literary career in 1921 with a weekly Hindi journal Tarun Bharat of which he was an associate editor. He also worked as an associate editor of the Kisan Mitra weekly in 1922, Golmal in 1924 and as an editor of the monthly journal Balak in 1926, but the publication of Yuvak made him more popular. =Yuvak Hindi Journal= Yuvak, an illustrated Hindi monthly magazine, was launched in January 1929 by Rambriksh Benipuri, a distinguished Hindi writer, critic, poet, journalist and freedom fighter. He was assisted by Ganga Sharan Singh (Sinha), Ambica Kant Sinha and Jagdish Narayan in its publication. Devoted to 'strength, courage and culture', Yuvak was edited, printed and published by Rambriksh Benipuri from the Patna Yuvak Ashram. It was printed at the Searchlight Press. Yuvak was the official organ of the Patna Yuvak Sangh founded in 1927 by Manindra Narayan Roy, a journalist of The Searchlight. Yuvak made Benipuri an eyesore of the colonial British government as its mission was to secure Swaraj for India promoting armed revolution and overthrowing the British regime. Its writings had a clear impact of Marxism as its contributors were political elites, avowed nationalists and Marxist revolutionaries. =As a Playwright= Rambriksh Benipuri stands in a class apart as a playwright. He wrote Ambapalai during his detention in the Hazaribagh Central Jail. Later on he wrote a series of one-act plays and radio-dramas, more notable being: the Netra-dan, Tathagat, Sanghamitra, Singhal Vijay and Vijeta. Benipuri had a forceful pen and was a prolific writer. Main attraction of Benipuri's plays lies in his way of writing. There is a delightful mixture of romanticism and idealism in his plays. =Short stories= In most of Rambriksha Benipuri's short stories pictures of rural life of north Bihar, specially that of Muzaffarpur district have been vividly presented. His Mati ki Mooraten, though not a story book in strict sense of the term, actually presents persons of flesh and blood, each throbbing with life, on a rural canvas. =Style and influence= Benipuri wrote mostly big stories and essays. His dramas covered mostly ancient events. For example, Amipure depicts the life of the famous courtesan Ambipure who adopted and converted to Buddhism after meeting Buddha. Likewise Netradaan (that is, Gift of Eyes), another drama, is based on a historical legend involving Ashoka and his son Kunal. He was also a distinguished playwright. A stanza from one of his famous poems, \\"Shahido ‚Äì tumhari yaad me\\" goes like this: The eminent Hindi writer, poet, play-wright, journalist and nationalist Rambriksh Benipuri, who spent more than eight years in prison fighting for India's independence writes of Non-co-operation movement as: Benipuri (right) at Kisan Sabha CSP Patna rally, August 1936 In the freedom movement Benipuri was a close associate of Jayaprakash Narayan and a leading light of the Congress Socialist Party. He took active part in the agitation against the Rowlatt Act and participated in the Non-cooperation movement launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920. He was an active member of the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee, a member of the Indian National Congress, one of the founder members of the Bihar Socialist Party and a member of the working committee of the All India Congress Socialist Party. He had also been the President of the Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha and the Vice-President of the All India Kisan Sabha. At the 50th session of the All India Congress Committee held at Faizpur in 1937 he moved a resolution on the abolition of Zamindari. Again, it was Benipuri who helped Jayaprakash Narayan escape from the Hazaribagh Central Jail along with Jogendra Shukul, Suraj Narayan Singh, Gulali Sonar, Pandit Ramnandan Mishra, and Shaligram Singh on 9 November 1942 keeping the prisoners engaged in Diwali Celebration. In Hazaribagh Central Jail, he initiated a campaign \\" Janaeu Todo Abhiyaan\\" (Breaking of the Upanayana threads) against Casteism. As Upnayan threads are the symbol of upper castes epesically Brahmin and Zamindar. Homage Benipuri on a 1999 stamp of India In 1999, Benipuri was one of the Hindi writers depicted in a set of commemorative postal stamps released to celebrate the \\"Linguistic Harmony of India,\\" marking the 50th anniversary since India adopted Hindi as its official language. Centenary celebrations The chief guest on the occasion of the birth centenary of Benipuri held in zonal railway training centre at Muzaffarpur, held under the auspices of railway ministry, was the former Prime Minister of India Chandra Shekhar. The main speakers included litterateur Namwar Singh and journalist Prabhash Joshi. Namwar Singh described Benipuri as only the second litterateur who preferred to associate his name with that of his village. Prabhash Joshi ranked Benipuri with Makhanlal Chaturvedi and Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi, who were both contemporary writers and journalists as well. He said '\\"Benipuri was not like today's journalists who work only to earn. Benipuri had a desire to create a \\"samtawadi samaj\\" and fight against imperialism.\\" Major literary works =Memoirs and essays= * Patiton Ke Desh Mein-1930-33 * Chita Ke Phool-1930-32 * Lal Taaraa-1937-39 Lal Tara is the symbol of a new light of the morning. The light is very near and therefore the darkness has increased. The writer wants to say that the darkness would disappear within a short time and a new rising light would come out. There are 16 such sketches in the collection. Benipuri tries to search out a new society, a new way of living and a new culture. * Kaidee Ki Patni-1940 * Maate -1941-45 * Gehun Aur Gulaab- 1948‚Äì50 It was published in 1950.

Senyum means smile in Indonesian and yayasan means 'foundation' or 'institute'. The Smile Foundation facilitates operations for cleft lip and palate and other craniofacial deformities, due to birth defects, accidents, or tumours. The organisation helps poor people from Bali, Lombok and further east, and raises funds for operations whether in Bali or Adelaide, Australia at the Australian Craniofacial Unit. Yayasan Senyum received a generous grant of US$2,500 from The Smile Train to enable the foundation to advertise the fact that cleft conditions can be treated and that it is able to assist people to get that treatment.  History  \\"Smile Shop\\" in Ubud The Smile Foundation of Bali was founded in 2005 by Mary Northmore-Aziz at the suggestion of Dr. David David from the Australian Craniofacial Unit, to identify those in need of craniofacial surgery. Dr. David David has continued his association as the chief adviser to the foundation. In December 2006 the foundation opened the \\"Smile Shop\\", which was the first Op shop in Bali. It provides a source of income for the foundation through the sale of secondhand goods and old stock from local businesses. After extensive fundraising, the \\"Smile House\\" was opened in January, 2007, in Denpasar. The Smile House provides accommodation and educational facilities, in particular for those from outlying areas.  Background  In many countries, craniofacial disabilities are treated shortly after birth. This is not necessarily the case in Bali. Craniofacial disabilities are not only disfiguring, but can also lead to difficulties with nutrition and communication. As such, treatment is essential. However, treatment is not just expensive, but it can involve extensive travel from the individual's home environment as well a complex bureaucratic process. This is exacerbated by a number of factors: many of the people requiring treatment are poor, often illiterate and they may not speak Indonesian. Thus not only do they have trouble paying for treatment (which may also involve accommodation and travel expenses), but when they arrive for treatment they have trouble completing admission forms and understanding the processes which need to be undertaken. In addition, many patients have not previously left their home villages, making the experience particularly difficult and traumatic, which is strengthened by the social isolation caused by their disabilities.  Activities  The foundation provides pre- and post-operative support and helps to organise treatment for people suffering from craniofacial disabilities. Part of this involves identifying those in need, both in Bali and the surrounding Indonesian islands, as per David David's initial request. Once identified, the patients are sent either to the Sanglah General Hospital or the Dharma Husada Hospital in Denpasar, or, in the more serious cases, to the Australian Craniofacial Unit at the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide, South Australia. This may involve organising visas, passports and flights for the patients. For patients being treated in Denpasar, the Smile House provides accommodation, as well as educational services to the parents ‚Äî in particular as regards post-operative care.  Funding and operation  Much of the funding comes from donations from both individuals and organisations. For example, the Australian Consulate General in Bali, working with the Smile Foundation, provided funding for seventy children to have craniofacial surgery in 2006. Charity events, such as Adam Gyorgy's piano performance in 2006, are also important to the foundation. In November 2011, the Commonwealth Bank WTA tennis tournament in Bali will raise money for the charity auctioning works of art of participating artists such as Jo√´l BLANC. Additional funds are raised the Smile Shop, which sells secondhand goods, largely from expatriates, but also increasingly old stock from local shops and linen from hotels. The Smile Shop is staffed entirely by volunteers. The foundation is run by three paid employees, based at their office in the Smile House. In addition, Mary Northmore-Aziz is the chairperson, with Dr. David David and Dr A. A. Asmarajaya listed as advisers. The board includes Dr A. A. Asmarajaya, Denise Finney, Eko Prabowo and Sarita Newson.

He served in the Army and achieved the rank of Colonel, and also sat as Member of Parliament for Maldon from 1790 to 1826 and for Okehampton from 1826 to 1830.  Education  Felsted school; Winchester 1768; Brasenose College, Oxford 1778.  Family  Strutt was the 2nd son of John Strutt of Terling Place by Anne, daughter of Reverend William Goodday, rector of Strelley, Nottinghamshire. His elder brother John died in 1781. He married Lady Charlotte FitzGerald, daughter of James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster, and Lady Emily Lennox, in Toulouse on 21/23 February 1789. With her he had one son and two daughters.  Military career  Strutt was Lieutenant Colonel of the western battalion of the Essex militia from 1783‚Äì96, Colonel of the South Essex militia in 1798, 1803-5 and 1809, and West Essex militia 1823‚Äì31; When the supplementary militia was reduced, Strutt offered William Pitt the Younger, and subsequently Henry Addington, his services in raising a regiment: the advent of peace rendered his offer superfluous.  Parliamentary career  Strutt returned from France to contest his father's seat in Maldon on the latter's retirement in 1790. A mostly silent but conscientious parliamentarian, Strutt made little mark in Parliament; but, he set great store by his and his father's services to government in Essex, where his father was ‚Äòa constitutional pillar‚Äô and where Strutt was active as a militia colonel. They were proudly insistent that Maldon was ‚Äòa county, not a borough interest‚Äô and, waiving pretensions to a county seat, resisted moves by government to influence Maldon elections.C. R. Strutt, Strutt Fam. of Terling, 1650-1873, pp. 29-75 Like his father, he generally supported government, describing himself as a Tory in 1816; but he regarded himself as particularly attached to Pitt in politics.C. R. Strutt, Strutt Fam. of Terling, 1650-1873, pp. 29-75; Add. 38263, f. 256 At the June 1826 general election Strutt was returned in absentia for Okehampton. Aged 71, he left Parliament at the dissolution in July 1830.  Peerage  Throughout his life Strutt refused all honours offered to him. However, when he was offered a British peerage in 1821 for his services in the Army and Parliament he proposed that the honour be given to his wife, Charlotte, in her own right as Baroness Rayleigh. After a peerage for his wife had been granted as one of the coronation creations in 1821, Strutt, returning thanks to Liverpool, described the honour as ‚Äòrequiting the long constitutional conduct in and out of Parliament of my ... father and of my humble constant exertions within the sphere of a country gentleman‚Äô.Add. 38575, ff. 8, 10; Strutt, 50-51; Lord Rayleigh, Baron Rayleigh, 5. However, Lady Rayleigh died in 1836 and Strutt survived her by nine years, which gave his son precedence of rank over him.  Death  In his declining years he was consoled and nursed by his unmarried daughter Emily Anne (1790-1865), for whose future comfort he bought in 1840 St. Catherine's Court, near Bath, where he mostly spent the last five years of his life.Sir W. Gavin, Ninety Years of Farming, 21; C.R. Strutt, Strutt Fam. of Terling, 1650-1873, 100-102 Strutt died at Bath in February 1845 aged 86, four weeks after being forced by a fire in his bedroom to take to the street in his nightshirt.C.R.

It was located close to a lagoon (hence its name) not far off Cape Juby. The importance of the settlement was derived from its position in the trans- Saharan slave trade, and captives were shipped to sugar plantations on the Canary Islands. The Spanish were expelled from the area in 1524 by the Saadi dynasty. After its abandonment, the exact location of Santa Cruz de la Mar Peque√±a was forgotten, to the point that when, in 1916, the Spanish gained control of the Cape Juby Strip, which included the location, they assigned it a new name, Puerto Cansado. The place is presently named Foum Agoutir and is near to Tarfaya. On the other hand, in the mid-nineteenth century, during the Scramble for Africa, France and Spain laid conflicting claims over the Maghreb, and Spain became interested in its lost medieval fortress in order to claim the southern part of Morocco, and for no clear reason Ifni, more than 300 miles north from the real location, was wrongly considered the most likely area; and consequently that territory was ceded to Spain by the Sultanate of Morocco in the treaty of Wad Ras of 1860 as result of the Spanish-Moroccan War of 1859.

She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in Z√ºrich. She usually published under a male alias because of predominant sexism.  Biography  Druskowitz was born at Hietzing, in Vienna. In 1874 she moved to Z√ºrich and completed her abitur in 1878. After studying philosophy, archeology, German literature, Orientalism and modern languages, she became the first Austrian woman and the second after Stefania Wolicka to obtain a doctorate in philosophy, with a dissertation on Byron's Don Juan. She then worked as a literary history teacher in different universities (Vienna, Zurich, Munich, Basel). She also traveled to North Africa, France, Italy and Spain before returning to Vienna. In 1881 she met Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach who introduced her to her literary circle. Three years later, she became acquainted with Lou Andreas Salom√© and Friedrich Nietzsche, whom she was introduced to by the circle of Malwida von Meysenbug. Helene Druskowitz was one of the happy few who received a copy of the fourth book of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, published at the author's expense. However, the relationship with Nietzsche did not last long. In 1885 she published a book on Three English Writers, Joanna Baillie, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and George Eliot. Helene Druskowitz's brother died in 1886, and her mother in 1888. In 1887, she began a live-in relationship in Dresden with the opera singer Therese Malten.Who's Who in Gay and Lesbian History edited by Robert Aldrich and Garry Wotherspoon; Routledge, London (2202) She started to drink excessively and also had some drug problems. After a romantic separation in 1891, she finally slipped into alcoholism, and was sent in 1891 to a psychiatric hospital in Dresden. However, Helene continued to write and publish until 1905. She helped found the feminist reviews Der heilige Kampf (The Holy Struggle) and Der Federuf (The Call to Feud). Druskowitz criticized both religion, sexism and, after her break with Nietzsche, his philosophy. She died at the end of May 1918 in Mauer-√ñhling, of dysentery, having spent the last 27 years of her life in a psychiatric institution.

It was located above the mouth of the river at its confluence with Bakers Creek, flowing westward from Maryville. During its heyday in the 19th century, Morganton thrived as a flatboat port and regional business center. An important ferry operated at Morganton for nearly 170 years providing service across the river. The abandoned townsite was submerged in the late 20th century by creation of Tellico Lake, part of the Tellico Dam hydroelectric project completed in 1979 by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Due largely to the decline in river trade that occurred in the mid-19th century following construction of railroads in East Tennessee, Morganton was mostly deserted by the late 1960s. This was when the TVA began buying up property to prepare for construction of Tellico Dam. Since the flooding of the lake area, the Morganton Cemetery, which overlooks the former townsite, is all that remains of the community. A road and Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency boat ramp are named for Morganton. Geographical setting The Little Tennessee River rises in the Appalachian Mountains of Georgia and meanders its way through southwestern North Carolina before entering Tennessee, where it flows for roughly before emptying into the Tennessee River near Lenoir City. The TVA bought properties throughout the river valley in preparation for completion of Tellico Dam at the river's mouth in 1979, which created a lake that spanned the lower of the river. Morganton was located above the mouth of the Little Tennessee at the river's confluence with Bakers Creek, which flows westward from Maryville.James Polhemus and Richard Polhemus, An Assessment of the Archaeological Potential of Townsite of Morganton in Loudon County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: Tennessee Valley Authority, 1978), 1. The Morganton site is visible from the junction of East Coast Tellico Parkway and Morganton Road, just west of Greenback. The area is under the management of the Tennessee Valley Authority. History Prior to any European-American settlement here, this area was part of a territory dominated for centuries by the Cherokee Nation (1794-1907). =Early history, 1800-1860= The former site of Morganton, now under Tellico Lake. After the American Revolutionary War, there was increasing pressure by European-American settlers who started migrating into this area and squatting on Cherokee lands. The Overhill Cherokee had several major villages that were located upstream; for instance, Mialoquo was situated just around Wears Bend, on the opposite side of the Little Tennessee River. By this time, most of these villages had either been destroyed in earlier warfare or were in decline, in part due to high fatalities from smallpox epidemics. Under pressure from the United States, The Morganton area was part of the lands ceded by the Cherokee with the signing of the First Treaty of Tellico in 1798. The first Euro-American settlers had arrived at the mouth of Bakers Creek in 1796, however, when the land was still claimed by the Cherokee.Polhemus and Polhemus, 1. Ethnologist James Mooney recorded a Cherokee legend regarding blazed trees on the banks \\"opposite Morganton\\" that supposedly marked the location of hidden mines; he first published it in his volume on myths in 1900. This and a companion volume were republished in 1972.James Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville: C and R Elder, 1972), 414. By 1799 a grist mill had been established along Bakers Creek by Hugh and Charles Kelso. The following year, Captain Robert Wear (1781-1846) arrived in the area, establishing a plantation near the mouth of the river and a ferry near the mouth of Bakers Creek. In 1801, an inspection port was established near the ferry, and the small community that developed in its vicinity became known as \\"Portville.\\" The community of Portville incorporated in 1813 after the Kelso brothers donated land for the formation of a town square. The community chose the name \\"Morganton\\" after Gideon Morgan (1751-1830), a Revolutionary War veteran and prominent local merchant.Alberta and Carson Brewer, Valley So Wild (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1975), 94-95.Polhemus and Polhemus, 1-2. By the 1830s, Morganton had grown to become the main shipping hub and business center in the Little Tennessee region. Flatboats carried local products such as whiskey and hemp to trade throughout the Tennessee Valley-- and sometimes as far away as New Orleans-- for products such as clothing, salt, and spices. By 1832, the town had its own doctor, hatter's shop, hemp factory, wagon factory, cabinet shop, distillery, and silversmith.Brewer and Brewer, 94-96. A steamboat line connecting Morganton and Knoxville began operating in 1831.Polhemus and Polhemus, 2. =Decline, 1861-1967= Abandoned mill along Bakers Creek in Morganton, photographed in 1939 In late 1863, at the height of the U.S. Civil War, Confederate General James Longstreet hoped to cross the Little Tennessee at Morganton en route from Chattanooga to Knoxville to dislodge the troops under the command of Ambrose Burnside, who had occupied Knoxville earlier in the year. Longstreet later recalled: > Had the means been at hand for making proper moves I should have marched for > the rear of Knoxville via Morganton and Marysville ...Yong Kim, The > Sevierville Hill Site: A Civil War Union Encampment on the Southern Heights > of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee > Transportation Center, 1993), 15. As Longstreet lacked the materials to construct a pontoon bridge, however, he was forced to cross the Tennessee River at Loudon, and approach from the west. That same year, however, Union General William T. Sherman crossed the Little Tennessee at Morganton en route to Chattanooga. Sherman tore down several of the town's houses to construct a pontoon bridge. After the Civil War, railroads slowly replaced riverboats as the preferred mode of shipping and transportation. When the L&N; Railroad laid tracks through nearby Greenback in the late 19th century, Morganton slowly declined. In 1947, a bridge near Niles Ferry became toll-free, putting most of the ferries along the Little Tennessee River out of business. The Morganton Ferry was the last to go, folding in 1961.Brewer and Brewer, 97. =Archaeological survey, 1978= In 1968, the Tennessee Valley Authority reported 18 houses, a store, and a church at Morganton, all of which were to be torn down in anticipation of the construction of Tellico Dam. In 1978, as the Tellico Dam project was stalled by litigation, University of Tennessee archaeologists conducted a test survey of the Morganton townsite. Several early American artifacts were located, some dating to as early as 1762, as well as several projectile points. The artifacts were similar to those uncovered at the nearby Tellico Blockhouse site, which had been excavated around the same time.Polhemus and Polhemus, lithic and ceramic catalogues in An Assessment of the Archaeological Potential of Townsite of Morganton in Loudon County, Tennessee.

By modifying the global gain field of each frame of MPEG audio, the volume of that frame can be modified without altering the audio data itself. This allows for rapid, lossless MP3 audio editing that does not degrade the data from re-encoding. mp3DirectCut provides audio normalization and pause (silence) detection, and can split long recordings into separate files based on cue points in the audio, such as those provided by pause detection. mp3DirectCut can also record audio directly to MP3 from the computer's sound card input. All audio operations are performed using frame manipulation so, as such, mp3DirectCut is not a waveform editor. Audio clean-up such as click, hiss and noise removal is not possible. Features * An MP3 file can be edited without transcoding. * Cut, copy, paste, and volume change operations are provided; edits can be previewed, including a command that plays a segment without a selected region (previewing a cut) * Audio normalization and pause detection * MP3 recording with ACM or LAME encoder (not bundled) * Fast MP3 visualization * Supports Layer 2 (DVD/DVB audio) * Includes a tag editor for ID3v1 tags * Cue sheet support with auto cue (track division by time values) * Track splitting with filename and ID3v1.1 tag creation * VU meter, bitrate visualization * Supported on all versions of Microsoft Windows from 95 through 7; certain modes can be invoked from the command line * Unobtrusive: The installation file (as of April 2014) is 301 Kbytes; the installed program occupies a single directory (with one subdirectory for non-English help files, which can be deleted if not needed); the program does not modify the Windows Registry; a user's manual and a page of Frequently Asked Questions is included in the installation * The edited file can be used as a ringtone on mobile phones * Newer versions can also edit raw AAC audio files Limitations ;Granularity limitations * Edit positions in the file can be placed only at the start of an MP3 frame (of which there are typically about 38 per second). * Gains and fades are limited to 1.5 dB steps, as they are achieved by modifying the value of the MP3 frame's 8-bit global gain field. ;Unimplemented features * ID3v2 tags cannot be read, and if they are written out, they contain the incorrect song length if the length is modified. * The documentation warns that navigating a song does not, in all cases, land on the start of an MP3 frame. The documentation does not guarantee correct results in all cases. * The documentation is adequate but does not cover all cases. ;Possible introduction of error * Increasing the audio volume can lead to distortion if, on playback, multiplying the audio data by the global gain may increase the volume past its clipping threshold. Audio recordings that use Compressed audio to cap the overall volume may have already adjusted the global gain field. This may limit the ability to further amplify the recording with MP3DirectCut without causing clipping. ;AAC/MP4 * To work on AAC files, an extra library (libfaad2.dll) needs to be installed * Raw AAC audio is supported, but not AAC audio inside MP4 container files * If MP4 audio files need to be processed, the AAC audio stream needs to be extracted first, e.g. with mp4box (Simply renaming an .MP4 file to .AAC does not work, since a simply renamed file still contains an MP4 container file header).

The son of Chidamber N. Chitnis and Lucia Mallik, he was born in London and educated at Stonyhurst College. He was further educated at the University of Birmingham, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, and at the University of Kansas, where he graduated with a Master of Arts. An administration assistant of the National Coal Board from 1958 to 1959, Chitnis acted as agent for Eric Lubbock in the successful Liberal campaign in the 1962 Orpington by-election. Afterwards he rose to become head of the Liberal Party Organisation in 1966, embarking on a structural modernisation, but resigned in 1969 having had a strained relationship with party leader Jeremy Thorpe. Chitnis next worked for the Joseph Rowntree Social Service Trust, as secretary from 1969 to 1975, and chief executive and director from 1975 to 1988. He was a member of the Community Relations Commission from 1970 to 1977 and of the BBC Asian Programme Advice Committee between 1972 and 1977; he also chaired the latter between 1979 and 1983. From 1981 to 1986, he was chairman of Refugee Action and from 1986 to 1989 of the British Refugee Council. Chitnis served as an advisor to David Steel during the latter's leadership of the Liberal Party, and was influential during the Lib-Lab pact and the negotiations that led to the SDP‚ÄìLiberal Alliance. On 18 July 1977, he was made a life peer as Baron Chitnis, of Ryedale in the County of North Yorkshire. He sat on the crossbenches in the House of Lords. Chitnis married Anne Brand, daughter of Frank Mansell Brand, in 1964. They had one son, Simon, who died in childhood. He retired to France. Lord Chitnis died on 12 July 2013.

Municipalities typically comprise multiple towns, villages and settlements and are governed by a mayor who is elected by popular majority vote for a four-year term, and a municipal council which is elected using proportional representation for a four-year term. The creation of new municipalities requires that they must be created in a territory with a population of at least 6,000 and created around a designated settlement. They must also be named after the settlement that serves as the territory's administrative center, among other criteria. The council of a municipality is further permitted to create administrative subdivisions: mayoralties (kmetstvo), settlements (naseleno myasto), and wards or quarters (rayon). Mayoralties are overseen by elected mayors and typically comprises one or more villages or towns; they must contain a population of at least 250. Settlements are overseen by a manager appointed by the mayor of a municipality and thus have fewer responsibilities and less power than a mayoralty; they must have a population of fewer than 150. Wards are overseen by elected mayors and must include a population of at least 25,000; their creation is required in Bulgaria's three most populous municipalities. Like municipalities themselves, mayoralities and wards are designated administrative-territorial units, as they have their own elected officials. Settlements, however, are simply designated territorial units since their leaders are appointed.

Moores played as a wicketkeeper for Worcestershire and Sussex and captained Sussex in 1997. He retired from playing first-class cricket in 1998 and became the coach of Lancashire County Cricket Club, on 11 February 2009. Moores was a successful coach of Sussex leading the county to the 2003 County Championship. Moores coached England \\"A\\" on their tour of the West Indies in 2000-01 and the English National Cricket Academy from October 2005 to 2007. He was appointed coach of the full England team in April 2007. On 7 January 2009 Moores was removed as coach following a public falling out with Kevin Pietersen, who also left his position as England captain. He became the coach of Lancashire County Cricket Club, on 11 February 2009. In 2011, he became the only coach to have won the championship with two different counties. In 2014, Moores was re- appointed to coach the England national men's team, serving until shortly after the 2015 World Cup. Playing career Moores began his career at Worcestershire, where he made a name for himself as a young and talented wicket keeper. However, his opportunities were limited due to the consistency of David Humphries. He moved to Sussex in 1985, but again found his opportunities limited. Four years later he won his County Cap. In 1997 he was made Sussex captain and became part of the coaching set up. He retired in 1998 at the age of 36 in order to focus on his coaching career. Moores scored 7 first-class centuries, and also hit 8 List A fifties. Throughout his career he achieved over 800 dismissals, 727 of these being catches. Coaching career After retiring, Moores became coach of Sussex. After two county championship titles, he moved onto the England job. Following a row with then captain Kevin Pietersen, Moores was sacked and took over at Lancashire. Moores was appointed England Coach for a second time in 2014. In May 2015, Moores was sacked as England coach. Sussex Coach Under the leadership of Moores, Sussex won the second division of the Championship in 2001. The ECB appointed him as coach on the England A tour in 2000-01. On their return to the top flight, Sussex narrowly avoided relegation in 2002. However, in 2003 they improved significantly and won the title, Sussex's first Championship title in their 164-year history. The following season was a disappointment for Sussex, as they finished 5th in the Championship and were unable to make an impact in the 50 overs format of the game, nor in the inaugural Twenty20 Competition. In 2005 he was appointed as Rod Marsh's successor as director of the ECB's academy, following Sussex's promotion to Division One in the Totesport League. Coach of England =West Indies (2007)= Following the disastrous Ashes 2006/7 tour of Australia, and Cricket World Cup in the West Indies, Moores was appointed coach of the England cricket team in April 2007 after previous coach, Duncan Fletcher resigned. Moores was bold in his selections, bringing in relatively unknown players Matt Prior, Ryan Sidebottom and Owais Shah for the West Indian tour of England. Moores dropped other players who played in the Ashes tour, Chris Read, Sajid Mahmood, Geraint Jones and Ashley Giles. Andrew Flintoff, who was captain of the tour was unable to play in the series due to injury. England's regular captain, Michael Vaughan was also injured for the first Test at Lord's, so opening batsman Andrew Strauss was named temporary captain. The first Test was a draw after heavy rain, and in the second Test at Headingley Moores looked for his first victory. Following an injury to pace bowler Matthew Hoggard, Ryan Sidebottom was recalled to the international arena after a lengthy gap. After Vaughan, who was playing in his first Test match for 18 months scored a century, Sidebottom picked up 4 wickets as England bowled the West Indies out for 146 (though West Indian captain Ramnaresh Sarwan was injured, and did not bat.) Forcing the follow on, the West Indies made 141, meaning England won by an innings and 283 runs. Sidebottom kept his place for the third Test at Old Trafford, which England won by 60 runs, but pace bowler Liam Plunkett was dropped in favour of the returning Hoggard for the fourth Test at Chester-le-Street, which England won by seven wickets, meaning England had won Moores' first series as coach 3-0. Following the fourth Test, ahead of Moores' announcement of the One Day International (ODI) squad, overall captain Vaughan resigned as One Day captain. Paul Collingwood of Durham was named as his successor. Moores named some surprising members in his squad, including Jonathan Trott and Dimitri Mascarenhas, who were both uncapped. Several established players were left out including wicket-keeper Paul Nixon, Jon Lewis, Michael Vaughan, Ed Joyce and Andrew Strauss. England lost the first game of the limited overs part of the tour, a T20 International. Although England were unable to chase down a target of 208, they came close in reaching 193, an improvement on previous batting performances in this format of the game. In the second and final T20 game, England levelled the series after winning the game by 5 wickets, following a good display from Owais Shah. England took the lead in the ODI series after an impressive bowling display saw the West Indies dismissed for just 146. England lost the second game after rain halted their progress on several occasions. They went on to lose the match by 61 runs. England lost the final match of the series convincingly after being bowled out for just 196 chasing 289 to win. Despite the series defeat Moores received praise for rejuvenating the side and getting the best out of Ryan Sidebottom and Owais Shah, who had been used sparingly by the previous regime. =India (2007)= Moores second series in charge saw him come up against India. For the Tests, Moores called up Chris Tremlett and handed him his debut in the First Test. England came close to winning the match but fell one wicket short of a convincing victory, with India hanging on to post 282/9 on the final day after England took a big lead in to the second innings following a hundred from Kevin Pietersen. Had it not been for the rain delaying play on day five, England would have almost certainly won the match. This was seen as further improvements being heralded under the regime of Moores. The second test saw a less convincing performance from England, being bowled out for 198 in their first innings. To make matters worse, India made a huge 481 to put them in control of the test match. England batted bravely in the second innings, posting 355, but by then the damage had already been done and India required just 73 to win the match. They achieved this easily on the final day, meaning they had a 1-0 lead going into the final match. On the third and final test, India played for a draw, posting 664 in their first innings and showing little interest in declaring. After England were bowled out for 345 in response, India decided against enforcing the follow on. India finally declared on 180/6, setting England 500 to win. Batting admirably, England finished on 369/6. Hence the match ended in a draw, and India clinched the series 1-0. This marked Moores first defeat as Coach of England. England were expected to lose the seven match ODI series against India, as they were regarded as the dominant team in that format of the game. However, England cruised to victory in the first match at The Rose Bowl, with a convincing victory of 104 runs. The result was largely down to a majestic innings of 126 from Ian Bell, which helped England on their way to 288/2, a total India never looked like getting. In the second match, India levelled the series, winning the match by 9 runs after posting 329. Although Bell again impressed, hitting 64, England fell just short. England retook the lead following the third match at Edgbaston. Bell again batted well, scoring 79 as England posted 281/8. Although India started well, they were bowled out for 239. England made it back to back wins after winning the fourth ODI, beating India by 3 wickets in a closely fought encounter. The victory gave England a 3-1 series lead and put them on course for a series victory. India fought back at Headingley, winning a rain affected match on the DL Method. Things got worse for England in the following match at The Oval. Despite posting an impressive 316/6, led by a century from Owais Shah, a poor bowling performance, combined with an excellent innings of 94 from Sachin Tendulkar, saw India reach their target with just two balls to spare. This levelled the series at 3-3 with one game left to play. The final game saw England clinch a convincing victory after bowling India out for just 187. England never looked like losing, and reached their target in just 36.2 overs, finishing the match on 188/3. The victory saw England clinch the series 4-3, making amends for t he defeat they suffered in the test series. =Sri Lanka (2007)= The tour of Sri Lanka was Moores first tour overseas. The tour started with five ODI Internationals. Several new players were called up to the squad, including Phil Mustard and Graeme Swann. England were humbled in the first match, being bowled out for 150 chasing 270 to win the game. The following match saw the tables turned as England bowled Sri Lanka for out for 169 to win the game by 65 runs and level the series 1-1. Ryan Sidebottom, a player Moores had handed his debut to and integrated into the England squad, was the pick of the bowlers, with figures of 2-23. England then won the next match of the series which was badly affected by rain, resulting in the match being decided by the DL Method. The fourth ODI saw England complete a series win after winning the game by five wickets after chasing down 212 to win. Although England lost the final game by 107 runs after being bowled out for just 104, the 3-2 series win represented major progress for England, who had traditionally struggled on the sub-continent pitches. England had also gone into the series with a young team, including James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Ravi Bopara, showing that Moores was successfully bringing through a new crop of England players. The three match test series started poorly for England, as they lost the match by 88 runs. Despite England holding a first innings lead of almost a hundred, Sri Lanka posted 442/8 in the second innings, putting them on the front foot. England could only make 261 in their second innings, thus losing the match by 88 runs. In the second test Stuart Broad was given his debut. The pitch suited batsmen, with bowlers struggling to make an impact. England posted 351 in their first innings, only for Sri Lanka to make 548 in reply. The game ended in a draw with England finishing on 250/3. The second match was interrupted by rain, although Sri Lanka posted 499 in their first innings. England were dismissed for just 81 in reply, putting them in danger of losing the match. However, due to the rain, England survived, finishing on 251/6. England lost the series 2-1, meaning they had now lost their previous two test series. =New Zealand (2008)= England's tour of New Zealand started with two T20 Internationals. England won the first match by 32 runs following an impressive bowling performance from Ryan Sidebottom. After posting 193 in the second T20, England won by 50 runs. This saw them win the series 2-0 and provided Moores with yet another limited over series victory, following successes against India and Sri Lanka. it also marked Moores first T20 victory, having lost his only previous match against the West Indies. The first ODI saw England bowled out for just 130, which New Zealand easily chased down to win the match by six wickets. The second game saw England thrashed by ten wickets after being bowled out for just 158. England kept the series alive by winning the next game on the DL Method, following a good performance from Stuart Broad, a player who Moores had given his debut to and was now coming to rely on as a key player. The fourth match was the highlight of the series, with the match being tied after both teams reached 340 in their 50 overs. However, New Zealand went on to clinch the series 3-1 after winning a rain affected game by 34 runs on the DL Method. England went into the three match test series under pressure after losing their previous two against India and Sri Lanka. The series got off to a poor start for England as they were beaten by 189 runs in the first test, despite a hat-trick from Ryan Sidebottom. Another batting collapse contributed to England's defeat, with the team being bowled out for just 110 in their second innings. England redeemed themselves in the following match, winning by 126 runs. Tim Ambrose, who Moores had handed the wicket keeper spot to, helped to win the game after making a century. England won the final match of the series by 121 runs. England made 253 in their first innings before bowling New Zealand out for 168. England took control of the game, declaring on 467/7, putting them in control of the game. Although New Zealand reached 431, they still fell 131 runs short, giving England a 2-1 series win. New Zealand travelled to England in the summer of 2008. There were few changes made to the England team who started the first test match. The match ended in a draw following rain, with the match evenly poised after England posted 319 in response to New Zealand's 277. New Zealand ended the match on 269/6. The second test saw England win by six wickets. Despite New Zealand having a lead of 179 going into the second innings, England bowled them out for 114 in their second innings before going on to reach 294/4. England again won the third and final test at Trent Bridge, this time putting in a complete performance. New Zealand were bowled out for 123 and 232, allowing England to win the game by an innings and 9 runs and winning the series 2-0. This made it back to back Test series wins against New Zealand, and the first time Moores had won back to back test series. The one off T20 match saw England win by 9 wickets. Graeme Swann took figures of 2-21 as he continued to become an integral part of England's team, while Ian Bell helped guide England to victory after hitting an unbeaten 60. This marked England's third consecutive T20 win as Moores began to mould his first choice team. England got off to a good start in the ODI series, winning the first match by 114 runs. Kevin Pietersen hit an unbeaten 110 while Paul Collingwood took figures of 4-15. England were lucky to avoid defeat in the second match. After being bowled out for 162, New Zealand reached 127/2 off 19 overs. However, they did not win as 20 overs were needed to constitute the game. Although England bowled New Zealand out for 182 in the third ODI, they could only manage 160, meaning New Zealand won by 22 runs and levelled the series 1-1. The fourth match was another close encounter, with New Zealand winning by just one wicket after hitting the winning runs off the final ball of the match. New Zealand won the final match by 51 runs, securing a 3-1 series win for them, the same scoreline when the two sides had met in New Zealand earlier in the year. =South Africa (2008)= Following the home series against New Zealand, England faced South Africa. The tour started with four Test Matches against the South Africa, with the opener being played at Lord's. England named the same starting eleven for the sixth straight test match, but we're unable to beat the tourists despite scoring over 500 in the first innings. After South Africa made 247, England enforced the follow on, only for South Africa to secure a draw untroubled, losing only three second innings wickets. The following Test saw England's first defeat in the longer format of the game in the summer, as South Africa convincingly won by 10 wickets. The third test saw England suffer another defeat, this time by 5 wickets. England trailed by 83 runs going into the final innings, and despite posting 363, South Africa won the game with five wickets in hand. The defeat in the third test marked the end of Michael Vaughan's time as captain. Vaughan had been captain of the Test team before Moores had taken over, and his resignation left Moores with a decision to make about who succeeded him. Although it was Collingwood who had previously succeeded Vaughan as captain as the ODI Team, Kevin Pietersen was asked to step in as Captain for the final match of the series. Pietersen had been in good form with the bat and was seen by many as the obvious choice. England went on to win the final Test by 6 wickets, with Pietersen making a hundred on his first game as captain. Ahead of the ODI series, Collingwood stood down as ODI captain, allowing Pietersen to take control of the team for all formats of the game. The only T20 International between South Africa and England was cancelled due to rain, and so Pietersen's reign as permanent captain began in the first ODI. England won the game by 20 runs, with Pietersen again impressing with an unbeaten 90. In the second ODI, England humiliated the tourists, bowling them out for 83 and winning the match by 10 wickets. England again cruised to victory in the third ODI, winning by 126 runs and taking an unassailable 3-0 series lead. The fourth ODI again went England's way, this time they won by 7 wickets thanks to the DL Method. Although the final game was called off, England had already won the series 4-0, the first time they had remained undefeated in an ODI series during the Moores era. =India (2008)= England headed over to India in 2008 for the final tour of the year. Optimism was high following the demolition of South Africa in the ODI series, as much was expected ahead of Kevin Pietersen's first full Test series as captain. The tour started with seven ODI's. England were heavily defeated in the first match, with India posting 387/5 in their 50 overs. England could only manage 229 and the result lead to criticism due to the manner of the defeat. England improved in the second match although they still lost by 54 runs, although this time they had restricted India to 292. England narrowly lost the third ODI, losing on the DL Method by 16 runs. England lost the fourth ODI on the DL Method again, this time by 19 runs. Both results were controversial as England looked to be in control in both games and would have probably gone on to win. However, England were now 4-0 down with just three games left to play, meaning they had lost the series. The fifth ODI, resulted in a six wicket defeat for England. After England had posted 270/4, India chased it down within 44 overs. The final two games of the series were cancelled following the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Despite the terror attacks, the Test series still went ahead, although the games were moved in terms of location. England lost the first match by 6 wickets despite taking a lead of 75 into the second innings. England then declared on 311/9, but India chased down the total thanks to a century from Sachin Tendulkar Andrew Strauss had scored centuries in both innings for England, while Paul Collingwood also made a hundred in the second innings. The second test resulted in a draw, the first match England had not lost on the tour. India posted 453 in the first innings, while England avoided the follow on making 302. In the second innings India declared on 251/7, but England saw out the draw, ending the match on 64/1. The result meant that India won the Test series 1-0. =Conflict with Kevin Pietersen and removal (2009)= In early 2009, following England's losses in both the Test and one-day matches in India, the media reported that English captain Kevin Pietersen had asked the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to hold emergency meetings to discuss Moores' role with the team. Days later, Pietersen commented to the media publicly regarding the dispute, eliciting speculation that Moores might soon be removed as coach. Moores and Pietersen were believed to be in disagreement on several issues, including the team's training regime, and the possible selection of former England captain Michael Vaughan for play in an upcoming tour of the West Indies. On 7 January 2009, Moores was removed as coach by the ECB, and Pietersen unexpectedly resigned as captain. In June 2009, the furore having died down, Pietersen announced that the England dressing room was a far happier place for Moores's absence: \\"The team wasn't happy, things weren't right, and England cricket was going nowhere, but I believe in the last six months the team has made big progress before a huge, huge series against Australia. I'm very happy, and everyone's happy.\\"Quoted in Booth, Lawrence. \\"Myths; And stereotypes.\\" The Spin, 30 June 2009. With the tension between the two seemingly unresolved, following England's victory over Australia in the 4th Ashes Test at Melbourne which saw England retain the Ashes for the first time since the 1986-87 Ashes, Pietersen claimed that without the removal of Moores, England would not have been in a position to beat Australia, claiming the change in regime brought about a better working climate within the squad. Pietersen went on to say: \\"You know what - I have never said this before - I lost the captaincy, I got rid of the captaincy for the good of English cricket, and we would not be here today if I had not done what I did then.\\" Lancashire coach Following his dismissal as England coach, Moores accepted a job offer from Lancashire. He guided Lancashire to County Championship glory in 2011, the first time they had won the title outright since 1934. The title represented Moores third County Championship success. He also took Lancashire to the finals Day of the Twenty20 competition, although they lost at the semi final stage. 2012 represented a disappointing season for Lancashire, in which they were relegated into County Championship Division 2. However, the following season they were promoted after winning the second tier of the Championship, meaning Moores had achieved promotion with Sussex and Lancashire. Return to England After success as Lancashire coach, he was confirmed as the replacement of Andy Flower as head coach of England on 19 April 2014. Moores won his first game, an ODI against Scotland. =Sri Lanka (2014)= Following the Scotland game, Moores' first opposition was Sri Lanka. England narrowly lost the opening T20 match between the two sides in a high scoring match. England got off to a good start in the ODI series, winning a rain affected match after bowling out Sri Lanka for just 144. The next match saw England suffer a heavy defeat after they were bowled out for just 99. However, in the next game England bounced back, bowling Sri Lanka out for just 67 and winning the match by 10 wickets. They narrowly lost the fourth ODI by 7 runs, despite a quick fire century from Jos Buttler. England lost the final game of the series by six wickets to lose the series 3-2. However, England's performances had been well received and most pundits agreed that an improvement had been made following the disastrous tour of Australia. Moores' first test in charge ended in a draw, although England fell just one wicket short of winning the game. Stuart Broad took what he thought was the winning wicket with the penultimate ball of the match, only for the decision to be referred and overturned. The final match of the series was again a close affair, although this time it was Sri Lanka pressing for the win. Despite a century from Moeen Ali, England were bowled out in their second innings with the penultimate ball of the series, giving Sri Lanka a 1-0 series win. =India (2014)= Following the defeat to Sri Lanka, pressure was put on England to make changes ahead of the series with India. However, no changes were made and England secured a draw in the first Test. However, they lost the second Test and pressure was put on captain Alastair Cook and Moores. Both men stayed on, and England turned the series around. Moores handed wicketkeeper Jos Buttler a Test debut, and the team went on to win the third Test to level the series at 1-1. England then secured a comfortable victory in the fourth Test to go 2-1 up, with Ian Bell and Alistair Cook returning to form. In the final match of the Test series, England again won to win the series 3-1 and hand Moores his first series win since returning to England. The ODI series was less successful. Moored handed a debut to Alex Hales, although England went on to lose the first three matches of the series. Moores again stood by captain Alistair Cook, and England went on to win the final match of the series. They also won the only T20 match between the two sides to end the series on a high. =Build up to World Cup (2014‚Äì15)= England travelled to Sri Lanka for a seven match ODI series. They lost the first two matches to go 2-0 down in the series, but won the third match. After losing the next match, England again won to keep the series alive at 3-2. However, they were comprehensively beaten in the final two matches of the series which led to questions being asked again of Alistair Cook. Throughout the tour Moores had remained loyal to Cook, but after the final game he hinted that there may be changes. Cook was later removed as ODI captain, with Eoin Morgan taking over. The tri-series against India and Australia marked Morgan's first series as skipper. Morgan hit a century in the opening match, although England were beaten by Australia. England improved in the following match against India, securing a comfortable win. However, they again suffered defeat to Australia meaning that they had to beat India in the final game to qualify for the final. They did so, but again suffered defeat to Australia when they met in the final. Despite finishing as runners up, an assistant coach thought that England had improved and were now in a stronger position ahead of the World Cup. =World Cup (2015)= England's World Cup campaign got off to a poor start as they suffered a 111 runs defeat at the hands of Australia. They suffered another humiliating defeat in their next match as lost to New Zealand by eight wickets. England relieved the pressure on them by securing a comfortable win against Scotland, but another heavy defeat, this time nine wickets against Sri Lanka, meant that England had to win their final two games to qualify. Defeat against Bangladesh ended any hopes of qualification, which led to suggestions that Moores could be replaced as England coach. However, he was backed by Paul Downton to rebuild the side, with Moores himself saying he was committed to the job. England won their final match against Afghanistan by nine wickets. Moores was removed from the England coaching post in 2015, after an ODI against Ireland. =West Indies (2015)= Moores remained in charge of England for their tour of West Indies despite the resignation of the man who appointed him, Paul Downton. In the first match of the series, England got off to a good start, posting 399 in the first innings and then bowling the West Indies out for 295. However, they were unable to force a result and the match ended in a draw, with the West Indies saving the match. England won the second match of the series following a good batting display in the first innings. They bowled the West Indies out for 307 in the second innings, and then won the game by nine wickets thanks to contributions from Alistair Cook and Gary Ballance. Despite this, England lost the final match of the series after setting the West Indies a small target to chase in their second innings after an England batting collapse. The West Indies won the match by five wickets to draw the series 1-1. = Restructuring and Sacking (2015)= After the series Moores played down talk for the need of an enquiry, but rumours persisted that Moores' job was in danger. Moores remained in charge for the ODI match against Ireland, which was abandoned due to rain. After Andrew Strauss was appointed Director of Cricket, Moores was sacked as England coach and replaced by his assistant, Paul Farbrace. The ECB was heavily criticized for its treatment of Moores, with many players later coming out and saying they had enjoyed working with him. Other cricket work On 18 January 2008 David Graveney was removed as the head national selector. Geoff Miller took the position over, heading up a four-man panel which included Moores, James Whitaker and Ashley Giles.Graveney axed as England selector BBC News retrieved 18 January 2008 Moores is a member of Marylebone Cricket Club.

It was designed by George Allen Mansfield (original), William E. Kemp (1891 extension to north), Walter Liberty Vernon (1900 and 1902 addit and built from 1876 to 1877 by W Jago. It is also known as North Sydney Technical High School (former), St Peters Presbyterian School, St. Leonard's Public School, St. Leonard's Superior Public Boys' School, Greenwood Plaza and North Sydney Technical School. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Over the years, the school has been progressively upgraded as St Leonards Public School, St Leonards Superior Public School, North Sydney Superior Public School, North Sydney Primary School, North Sydney Intermediate High School, North Sydney‚ÄìChatswood Junior High, and, finally, as North Sydney Technical High School until its closure in 1969.  History  Prior to British colonisation in 1788, the lower north shore of Port Jackson (i.e. Terry Hills, Duffys Forest, Narrabeen, Dee Why, Curl Curl, Freshwater, Manly, Middle Cove, Lane Cove, North Sydney and Chatswood) was originally inhabited by the Gai-mariagal people. Six major family groups comprised the overall Gai-mariagal clan- the main three being Galmai, the Gatlay and the Gammeray. The land on which the former North Sydney Technical High School stands was occupied by the Gammeray people, recently referred to as Cammeraygal or Cammeraigal. The first fleet officer Collins noted that the Gammeray people were 'a stronger and more virile people than others living around the harbour as they were larger and more numerous. Collins also noted that it was the role of the Gammeray during initiation rites to remove the right front tooth of young men from neighbouring groups, a privilege believed now to be a reciprocal obligation with other groups who had ceremonial obligations with the Gammeray people. In April 1789 almost half of Sydney's Indigenous population died of smallpox. In 1790 Governor Phillip noted '...it is seldom that any of them are now seen near the settlement.' Survivors of the smallpox epidemic regrouped in areas such as Broken Bay, Kissing Point (Ryde), Woolloomooloo, Le Perouse and Botany Bay. This regrouping of ancient clans and families involved social re- organisation and possible merging of dialects and culture. By 1830 records show that apart from a group camping in the government boatsheds west of Circular Quay, few people identified as Aboriginal were living in Sydney. =School site= Former technical college, now Greenwood Hotel, , November 2007. The school was originally St Peters Presbyterian School; located on Blues Point Road and part of the Presbyterian Church, but after talks in May 1874 ownership was transferred to the Council of Education as a state school. St Leonards' population was rapidly increasing at this time and the Council of Education recognised the need to establish a new school. So in November 1875 the council purchased 1-1/4 acres of land from Mrs. Isabella Atcheson for A‚Ç§1,800. The land was seen very desirable due to its central location, sufficient space for playgrounds, and its \\"fine views of the harbour\\". After a year of discussion, plans for the new school were drawn by architect George Allan Mansfield, a leading architect at the time who had built many school buildings throughout Sydney in the 1870s and early 1880s. The plans included construction of a new Gothic Revival stone building to accommodate at least 100 children, adjoining small religious room, and also erection of a new teachers' residence with detached kitchen. The building was contracted to W. Jago for a period of ten months and was accepted by council February 1876. The school building was built of locally quarried Hawkesbury sandstone with dressed ashlar surround to all openings. The gabled roof featured ornamental bands of hexagonal shaped slates, carved finials, and detailed barge boards. The final cost of the school was ‚Ç§4,700 reflecting the building's elaborate stone detailing and its importance to the community. In March 1877 St. Leonard's Public School opened with 320 boys, girls and infants. The building boasted a finely detailed bell tower, which was one of the earliest and most prominent landmarks of the lower North Shore visible from the city. The first addition to the school was in 1882- as attendance had grown to 365; separate girls and infants departments were considered necessary. In 1883 the natural rocky grounds were asphalted. In 1884 Nimrod Greenwood was appointed headmaster and two years later the school was renamed St. Leonard's Superior State Public School. Then in 1890 the school was connected with gas, classrooms were completed for ‚Ç§896, and technical classes commenced in shorthand, bookkeeping, drawing and building construction. In 1891 more land was resumed and the following year a new building was erected to enable an extra 180 pupils to be enrolled. This addition extended the main body of the building creating a northern court and complementing the massing as a whole. The resultant plan was broadly an \\"H\\" shape. The addition was designed by schools architect William Kemp and detailing was of consistently high standard throughout with fine stone carving, detailed gable ends, and moulded timber columns and valence boards on the verandahs. By September 1892 there were a total of 820 pupils. In 1893 the Girls' Department was moved to the Presbyterian School to make more room for infant classrooms. To improve natural lighting in these rooms, windows were cut into the walls and glass partitions were installed. In addition to these changes, new fencing was erected, all wood and ironwork was repainted, and the flagging up on the south side beneath the verandah was replaced with new stone. The new buildings were officially opened in April that year by P. Cullen, the chairman of St. Leonard's District school board, and the school was renamed St. Leonard's Superior Public Boys' School. In 1898 another new building was necessary to house 100 more boys. Additional land in Miller Street was purchased in 1900 and two years later a girls' block was built building costing ‚Ç§3,300 and enabling the number of girls enrolled to be increased to 450. In 1908 the govemment architect W. L. Vernon was contracted to make some alterations to the school. * Three new doors in the west wall upstairs * Two new doors to a wall downstairs * Original front door built up * All fireplaces bricked up except the southem fireplace * Fireplace removed in original wing and replaced with two windows * All verandahs to the north enclosed to form a corridor, hat room and teacher's room * New folding partitions throughout the building * Existing glass replaced with clear glass * Removal of front verandah (south side) to enable more natural lighting into classrooms . Erection of an additional outside staircase. The following variations were made by John Brown in March 1911: * Concrete lintels instead of arches to carry joists * Lighter construction for uniformity * Breaking openings in old cavity to ensure exclusion of damp * Channelling old walls with two courses to support concrete floors. The school was renamed to North Sydney Public School in 1910, but it continued to be known unofficially as Greenwood's School after the very popular headmaster. In 1912, seventy two boys and seventy five girls enrolled as intermediate high school students, secondary classes commenced and North Sydney Intermediate High School was formed. The following year additions were made to the Miller Street building enabling North Sydney Junior Technical High school to function there as a demonstration and a commercial school. In 1914 much respected headmaster, Nimrod Greenwood, retired after 30 years service to the children of the district. Shortly after Greenwood's retirement the girls were transferred to the new North Sydney Girls' High School and in 1915 the senior boys were transferred to North Sydney Boys' High School. In 1920 the school was renamed North Sydney Boys' Intermediate High School. In 1936 with an enrolment of 703 pupils, the school was renamed North Sydney and Chatswood Junior High School. From 1943 the school was called North Sydney Technical High school and was home to another respected Headmaster, John Ireland (1948 - 1954). Then in 1969 the school was closed and used as an Educational Resources Centre. =Site sale and redevelopment= During the 1970s the school was neglected by the NSW Education Department and was regularly attacked by vandals. In March 1978 the Register of the National Estate listed the school on their register and in 1980 Lend Lease won a tender to lease the site, but failed to win approval from planning authorities to erect a $100 million complex. The fate of the school was unsure, until February 1987 when the NSW State Government announced the sale of the school and surrounding land. The government consulted North Sydney City Council and outlined that any development conform to the following restrictions: * the original sandstone school building be retained; * 60% of the site be kept as open space for a public plaza and setting for the school; * three mature Moreton Bay fig trees be retained; * provision for a pedestrian link to North Sydney Railway Station and across the Pacific Highway; and * commercial office space limited to a floor space ratio of 3.5:1. The Old Lions (the school's old boys' union), the North Shore Historical Society and the North Sydney Council disputed the sale as they were concerned about the welfare of the former school. In June 1987 the Heritage Minister Bob Carr responded to their outcry by listing the school and surrounding property on the NSW Heritage Act- Permanent Conservation Order, thus insuring the original school building and the three old Moreton Bay fig trees (Ficus macrophylla) would be conserved. The sale was managed by Raine and Home, North Sydney and tenders closed on 11 May 1987. A total of fourteen companies responded to call for tenders, and prices started from $33 million. The site was bought by Euro-National Properties Ply Ltd and Industrial Equity Ltd for a record $47.1 million. The winning proposal boasted a new 36-level landmark tower with red brown granite and bronze glass facade and a polished granite lobby. The $400 million landmark complex would provide of commercial office space and of retail space, include a day-care centre and parking for 497 cars. The scheme was designed by DGH International Pty Ltd with interior design by the Australian designers Rice Daubney Group. Developer John Tierney and his partners Maurice and Tony Green (of The Green Hotel Corporation) were in charge of the restoration and conversion of the former school into a boutique pub/restaurant. Construction started in 1989 by Metroplaza Construction Ltd. The most challenging aspect of the development was the excavation of of sandstone around the footing of the former school building. This involved literally \\"propping the school up\\" whilst burrowing underneath and reinforcing its foundations without damaging the structure. Wind tunnel tests were also carried out to assess any wind risks from the tower block and as a result all the school's old chimneys were reinforced with steel rods. (Note: It is recommended these be inspected for corrosion and impact on sandstone work.) The construction of the shopping plaza below ground level enabled direct access to adjacent areas such as the North Sydney railway station, and Miller Street and The Pacific Highway (both having a lower ground level than the school). In November 1991 the project ran into financial difficulties and Industrial Equity Ltd liquidated its $500 million investment into the plaza and changed the contractor to Multiplex. In June 1992 Optus Communications agreed to lease the tower and paid for naming and signage rights to the building giving it a dominant position in the North Sydney skyline. The change in building contractors paid off and the Plaza was completed ahead of schedule in October 1992. The Mirvac Group bought the site in 1994. The Kemp-designed two storey brick school buildings facing Miller Street were demolished as part of the tower redevelopment. A 1980 photoTropman and Tropman, 2008, 14, figure 16) shows this building still facing Miller Street. The original school building was adapted for use as a hotel . In 1997 approvals were given to construct a childcare centre at the base of the adjacent Optus tower.Branch Report, 10/1997 In 2017 the leasehold for the Greenwood Hotel was offered for sale by CBRE Hotels, on behalf of freehold owner Mirvac. History Developing from probably the first school on the colony's northern shore, the origins of the school started in 1844 in a two- room weather-board cottage (no longer in existence) on Blues Point Rd close to Lavender Street, then to a small stone school house at 12 Miller Street. A new school-house was built during 1877 in the Gothic Revival style at Blue Street, North Sydney by the New South Wales Council for Education. Officially opened in 1878, it offered education for boys and girls from Infants to Primary. Extensions were added over time, with the second story class-rooms completed in 1893. Often referred to colloquially as ‚ÄúGreeny‚Äôs‚Äù for Nimrod Greenwood, its longest-serving head-master (1884-1914), the school grew, spawned others, was modified and shaped; its curriculum specialities and name, changing to reflect the needs of a rapidly expanding north shore community; its educational philosophy inspiring achievement over generations. * 1874: St Leonards Public School * 1886: St Leonards Superior Public School * 1910: North Sydney Superior Public School * 1912: North Sydney Intermediate High School. * 1914: \\"Intermediate\\" graduate girls seeking further study transferred to the new North Sydney Girls High School on Lane Cove Road (now Pacific Highway). * 1915: \\"Intermediate\\" graduate boys seeking Leaving Certificate qualifications enrolled at the newly opened North Sydney Boys High School at Falcon Street. * 1931: \\"Infant and Primary\\" students were transferred en bloc to the new North Sydney Demonstration School on the Lady Hay Estate, at the corner of Pacific Highway and Bay Road. * 1934: Due to the demolition of school buildings to make way for the Harbour Bridge access road cutting, staff and \\"Household Arts\\" girls were transferred to be the initial student population of the new Willoughby Home Science School at Mowbray Road. * 1936: North Sydney & Chatswood Boys Junior High school * 1942: North Sydney Technical High School At its closure in 1969, due to the increasing commercial density of the North Sydney CBD, it was one of only two selective boys high schools on the north shore. The few remaining pupils were transferred to North Sydney Boys High School. The School Principal and many of the teaching staff transferred to Killara High School, which opened the following year. The substantial library was also transferred to Killara High School. The Old Lions, together with the North Shore Historical Society, lobbied to have the building saved, restored and now heritage-listed for all to enjoy. The restored stone building on the school site is now leased to the Greenwood Hotel.  Description  =Curtilage boundary= South: One of the Moreton Bay fig trees (Ficus macrophylla) forming part of the curtilage dominates the Blue Street front of the curtilage, screens the school building from the street. Bus stop shelters further separate the school from Blue Street. The Pacific Highway frontage of the site comprises a two-storey facade of Greenwood Plaza (which can be accessed directly from the Pacific Highway), with the school behind on a higher level. The northern skylight of the plaza below is at this upper ground level of the school. West: along the edge of the former school, facing Gas Lane the curtilage is about 4 metres into this laneway space. On the eastern side of the former school, the curtilage is about 4m east of the school's facade. On the northern side of the former school, the northern skylight structure of the Greenwood Plaza below is entirely within the SHR curtilage. = Modifications and dates = *1882: addition - separate girls and infants' departments *1890 gas connected, classrooms completed *1891 more land resumed *1892 new building built for extra 180 pupils, extending main building, creating a northern court in \\"H\\" shape *1893 Girls' Dept. moved to Presbyterian School to make room for more infant classrooms.

The Old Lions holds a members' dinner and a teachers' lunch each year, and provides a monetary award to Killara High School students for Excellence in Technology and Applied Studies. A large proportion of The Old Lions' memorabilia is recorded in an online database. Membership of the association remains very strong considering that the school closed more than 40 years ago. =Notable alumni= The school has had a number of notable Australians amongst its alumni: * Trevor Allan, rugby international and Australian captain * Gavin John (Bon) Andrews, rugby. North Sydney Oval No 2 is named in his honour * Rod Batterham, rugby international * Winston ‚ÄúBlow‚Äù, Ide‚Äî1939 Wallabies team * Allan Border, cricket international * Peter Brain, Anglican bishop * Alan Cadman, Liberal Party federal minister * Barry Cohen, Labor Party federal minister * David Colley, cricket international * Richard Coxon, Olympic yachting * Geoffrey de Groen, abstract artist * James Devereux, 1908 Kangaroos team *Richard Dunn, artist * Ken Eastwood, cricket international * Peter Finch, international stage and screen actor * Ken Gulliver, baseball international * Carl Halvorsen, boat builder * David Humphreys, Olympic cycling * Allan Livingstone, Olympic kayaks * Ian Macphee, Liberal Party federal minister * Neville McWilliam, Australia's first blind barrister * Bill Morrison, federal minister * Gerald Bruce Muston, Anglican bishop *Peter Myers, architect * Colin Parker, landscape artist * Bill (William) Ronald, Olympic fencer * Peter Rothwell, rugby international * Ken Shadie, co-writer of Crocodile Dundee * Dick Smith, entrepreneur, aviator, publisher, philanthropist * James Staunton, chief judge of the NSW District Court * Nancy Wake, World War II heroine * Bevan Wilson, rugby international * Roger Woodward, world-renowned pianist  Heritage listing  As at 29 September 2008, the Greenwood Hotel is a rare and unique example of Gothic and Romanesque Revival styles and remains substantially intact from 1908. The earliest wing of the school was built to the design of architect George Mansfield, a prominent architect of the time, and is an exceptional example of his work. The other parts of the building demonstrate the work of another notable 19th century state school Architect William Kemp. The Greenwood Hotel was the first state school erected on the north shore of Port Jackson and was the first technical school on the north shore. The fact that the school was used continuously for educational purposes from 1877 to 1969 is of high significance and has created a strong cultural meaning to people in the area. The sandstone structure is now surrounded by open landscaping and urban development elements and the nearby towers are set away from the Greenwood Hotel. This space has become an important urban precinct for retailers, office workers and locals, and is well utilised as a pedestrian thoroughfare and a place to meet and relax. The two remaining Moreton Bay Fig trees retain the setting of the Greenwood Hotel and the landmark qualities of the area. The sandstone building is a scarcity of architectural type and is relatively intact. The age of the building relates to the predominant fabric of North Sydney and the building fabric itself demonstrates this historical significance. The school and its open setting with fig trees are landmarks of North Sydney and engender a high degree of public esteem in relation to its local and schooling history. North Sydney Technical High School was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Statens Serum Institut (), or SSI for short, is a Danish sector research institute located on the island of Amager in Copenhagen. Its purpose is to combat and prevent infectious diseases, congenital disorders, and threats from weapons of mass destruction. Founded in 1902 in the barracks of the Artillerivej road, it has now expanded to much more than its original size and is now one of Denmark's largest research institutions in the health sector. 20% of sales are used on Research and Development and Danish and International funds contribute around 100 million DKK. Administratively, the State Serum Institute sorts under the Danish Ministry of Health and Prevention under minister of health. The president and CEO of the institute has since 1998 been Niels Strandberg Pedersen. The Department of Epidemiology plays a large role in the surveillance and tracking of infectious disease outbreaks in Denmark allowing for comprehensive monitoring of Danish public health. Apart from research into epidemiology and disease prevention, the institute also develops and produces vaccines, and is an integral part of the Danish ABC- preparedness operation. The institute has successfully produced the vaccines: BCG vaccine Danish Strain 1331 against tuberculosis, diTeBooster for revaccination, and VeroPol which is an inactivated poliomyelitis virus vaccine(IPV) that produces antibodies after primary vaccination for poliovirus 1, 2, and 3. Apart from work in Denmark, Statens Serum Institut is also involved in health promotion and monitoring in Guinea-Bissau, as maintained by the Bandim Health Project. Mainly doctors, pharmaconomists (expert in pharmaceuticals) and pharmacists work at the National Serum Institute. A total of 385 people at SSI are engaged in research. SSI contributes each year over 30 master students and 10-15 PhDs. In 2009, the institute made 326 publications, 279 of which had an impact factor. 74 of these publications were related to topics of infectious disease; an area of study that the institute is focusing on in preparation for new resistant strain emergence due to antibiotic resistance. SSI has transferred its vaccine production business to AJ Vaccines. AJ Vaccines will continue to produce vaccines on SSI's facility. SSI, under the auspices of the Ministry of Health and Prevention, will continue to be responsible for ensuring the supply of vaccines to the Danish vaccination programmes.

Includes data from PubMed (Medline citations) as well as numerous other health-related government websites and hundreds of authoritative clinical sites, analyzed and approved by medical specialists. # Searchmedica.fr, a version for the French market with a focus on medical websites in French # Searchmedica.es, a Spanish version. SearchMedica connected medical professionals with well-known, credible journals, peer-reviewed research, and evidence-based articles written for practicing healthcare professionals. In addition to ranking search results according to both publication date and relevance, SearchMedica also allowed users to focus searches by categories such as journal content, evidence-based medicine, guidelines, and patient information. SearchMedica was run by CMPMedica, a part of United Business Media, and was set up using search engine technology from Convera.  History  The English version was the launched in June 2006, followed by the US version in August 2006 and the French version in February 2007. The Spanish version went live in the summer of 2007 and a relaunch occurred in January 2008. None of the primary websites appear to be operational at this time (25MAR2020)  Business model  SearchMedica makes money through advertising. However, advertising does not bias the ranking of results in their search engine.

She graduated LL.B from the University of Sydney's law school in 1924. Early life Born at Petersham, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Morrison was the daughter of Charles Henry Victor Emanuel Gibbs, a Victorian-born pastoralist, and his second wife Alexandrina Caroline Elizabeth, n√©e Munro, from Parramatta. Morrison received her education at Shirley College, Edgecliff, and the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney (P.L.C), at Croydon. She was then a resident in The Women's College while studying law at the University of Sydney, where she graduated in 1924. During her classes at Sydney's law school, she witnessed first-hand the prejudice against women in the legal profession, experiencing cat-calling and foot-stomping from her male peers. In 1923, she took a break from her studies to visit Britain, and subsequently married a ranch owner, Charles Carlisle Morrison in London on 1 October of that year. Returning to Sydney, she completed her law course and on 2 June 1924 was admitted to the New South Wales Bar, where she became the first woman to practise. Career In Morrison's first appearance as a barrister, she was to act for a plaintiff widow claiming under the Testator's Family Maintenance and Guardianship of Infants Act. She successfully established herself at the Bar and was on occasions briefed by fellow pioneering female lawyers, Christian Jollie Smith and Marie Byles (also a school friend from her P.L.C days), both of whom had been admitted as solicitors in 1924. With her solid legal knowledge, Morrison was welcomed as a member of the National Council of Women of New South Wales, and was convener of their laws committee. In November 1926, she presented a paper on divorce in Australia when the National Council of Women was advocating uniform Federal marriage and divorce laws. She divorced her husband in 1928. Returning to London in 1930, Morrison was called to the Bar of the Middle Temple in May. Back in Sydney, she remarried, this time to architect Carlyle Greenwell on 16 March 1937, at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church. She was no longer listed as a practising barrister after this marriage. In 1940 she became the first president of the Law School Comforts Fund, becoming a life vice-president in 1942. She was also involved with what became the Business and Professional Women's Club of Sydney. Although Sibyl Morrison had been in competition with male colleagues throughout her career, it is said that she never lost her femininity, with a magazine noting that she was \\"an exceedingly smart up-to-date frocker\\". Death Morrison died of cancer at Collaroy in Sydney on 29 December 1961, and was cremated with Anglican rites. She never had children. From an estate valued at ¬£72,011, she made two bequests of ¬£1000 for annual prizes or scholarships in the faculty of law to be named after her mother and herself. After several other bequests, she left the residue to the University of Sydney, to be known as the 'Sibyl Greenwell Bequest' to support the small animal section of the Rural Veterinary Centre at Camden.

In the early 1960s she was a regular pop music performer on United States TV shows, Don McNeill's Breakfast Club and Sing Along with Mitch. From 1968 to 1981 she was a country music singer in the US and in Australia. In the US, she had eighteen singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, where her top 20 hits are \\"Say When\\" and \\"It's a Man's World (If You Have a Man Like Mine)\\" (both 1973), \\"When I Get My Hands on You\\" and \\"Lean It All on Me\\" (both 1974). In January 1962 she married Thom Ewen, a Connecticut businessman, to become Diana Ewen. In the 1980s Trask withdrew from performing to look after Ewen, who had had a stroke: he subsequently died in 2009. The couple have two children. Trask co-authored her autobiography, Whatever Happened to Diana Trask: A Memoir, with Alison Campbell Rate, on 1 May 2010. Early career Diana Roselyn Trask was born on 23 June 1940 in the Melbourne suburb of Camberwell and raised in the then-rural town of Warburton. Her father was Lew, who ran a furniture business, and her mother is Thelma (nee Salisbury), who was a music teacher. Trask sang from an early age, performing at school functions and for her family. In August 1949 she won the Under 10 Solo Girls category at the Lilydale Eisteddfod. At 16, she received formal vocal lessons from her mother. She became a part of a singing group. Trask won a talent show, TV Quest, in 1957. She signed with Lee Gordon as her promoter. Her first two singles were \\"Going Steady\\" (1958) on W&G; and \\"Lover Is Another Name for Fool\\" (1959) on Gordon's Leedon label. Gordon arranged for her to open for international visitors, including Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr., who each toured Australia in early 1959. Acting on encouragement from Sinatra and Davis, Trask relocated to the United States. In August 1959 she debuted as a jazz singer at New York City's Blue Angel club. She became a regular on Don McNeill's Breakfast Club TV show and appeared as a dancer and singer on Jack Benny's TV show. Mitch Miller gave her a recording contract in 1960 with Columbia Records and also a regular spot on his TV show, Sing Along with Mitch. By 1961 Trask was earning A¬£44,000 per year and lived at the Middletown Hotel, NYC. Late that year she became engaged to Thom Ewen, a businessman from Connecticut; they married in Warburton's Roman Catholic Sacred Heart Church, on 7 January 1962. Ewen, who was 34-years-old, had recently divorced his first wife, who retained custody of the couple's two children. Trask released two albums, Diana Trask (1961) and Diana Trask on TV (1962), via Columbia, which were geared towards the pop market but neither was successful. After Miller's show was cancelled in 1964 Trask and Ewen moved to Melbourne to continue her career. She appeared regularly on In Melbourne Tonight on GTV-9 during that year. In 1965 she hosted her own 13-week TV variety programme, Di Trask Show, with Ewen as producer for the same channel. According to Nan Musgrove of The Australian Women's Weekly it \\"wasn't all that popular here but sold like hot cakes overseas in 26 countries.\\" Country career In 1967 Trask and Ewen returned to the US and initially settled in NYC and then in Nashville; where she started as a country singer. She signed with Dial Records that year, and in July 1968 had her first charting single, \\"Lock, Stock, and Tear Drops\\", which reached the top 70 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs. Trask signed a record deal with Dot Records and released an album, Miss Country Soul (March 1969), which provided her nickname and reached No. 34 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. It was produced by Joe Tex and included her cover versions of his work. Her versions of Tex's R & B tracks, \\"Hold What You've Got\\" and \\"Show Me\\", display a soulful voice. They drew critical acclaim, while the lead single, \\"Hold What You've Got\\" (July 1968), reached the top 60. Rubber City Reviews Tim Quine opined \\"I wouldn‚Äôt throw away the original, but Trask seems pretty comfortable taking the women's point of view on her version of Joe's hit 'Show Me'.\\" Trask released her fourth studio album, From the Heart, in November 1969, which peaked at No. 32. It provided her version of Patsy Cline's \\"I Fall to Pieces\\" (March 1970), which reached No. 37\\\\. She followed with a cover version of George Jones' \\"Beneath Still Waters\\" (February), which reached No. 38. Trask released her seventh studio album, Its a Man's World, in March 1974, which peaked at No. 25. It provided three singles, which reached the top 20 country songs chart, \\"Say When\\" (May 1973), \\"It's a Man's World (When You Have a Man Like Mine)\\" (August) and \\"When I Get My Hands on You\\" (February 1974). She followed with Lean It all on Me (July 1974) and its title single, \\"Lean It All on Me\\" (May 1974) ‚Äì her highest charting track, reaching No. 13 on the country charts. It was also issued as a single in the United Kingdom via Ember Records, backed with \\"Behind Closed Doors\\". She also toured the UK with Glen Campbell who wrote the sleeve notes for her Ember album. She continued with Dot Records singles, \\"If You Wanna Hold On (Hold on to Your Man)\\" (October 1974) and \\"Oh Boy\\" (March 1975), which are her last top 40 country hits. Later career and present Trask continued releasing albums and singles with Dot Records until 1977. She made a brief comeback via the Kari label with two non album singles, \\"This Must Be My Ship\\" (April 1981) and \\"Stirrin' Up Feelings\\" (September). The Ewen family returned to Australia, where she resumed her career. In 1979 Roger Climpson, host of Australia's version of This Is Your Life, surprised her during a rehearsal for the TV tribute show. Trask wrote the track, \\"I Think About Your Lovin'\\", which was recorded by the Osmonds in 1982. In the 1980s Trask withdrew from performing to look after Ewen, who was incapacitated following a stroke: the couple lived on a yacht and cruised the Caribbean until Ewen's health began to fail in the late 1980s. From 2006 the couple lived in Woodbine GA until Thom Ewen died in 2009, after which Trask resided in nearby St. Mary's. Trask co- authored her autobiography, Whatever Happened to Diana Trask: A Memoir, with Alison Campbell Rate, which was published on 1 May 2010.

On release, it caused a national controversy and threats of libel actions in Britain because of the perception that its characters were based on real people, including Lord Brownlow, a friend of King Edward VIII who had also served as mayor of Grantham. The book was withdrawn after three weeks.Andrew Bond, \\"Obituary: Oliver Anderson\\", The Independent, 11 November 1996 , archived here.

The book was republished in 1989.Martin Pugh, \\"Grantham Factor\\", London Review of Books, 2 March 1989.

January 26, 2006. Accessed August 4, 2007 The civil society campaign focuses on the improvement of working conditions in the garment and sportswear industries. Formed in the Netherlands in 1989, the CCC has campaigns in 15 European countries: Austria, Belgium (North and South), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The CCC works with a partner network of more than 250 organizations around the world. Structure The national branches of the CCC are autonomous organizations of consumer groups, trade unions, human and women's rights organizations, researchers and activists. Representatives from each national campaign meet three times a year to coordinate international activities. Activities =Retailers and distributors= The Clean Clothes Campaign insists that companies bear a responsibility and have the power to ensure that workers throughout their supply chains are treated fairly. The CCC has developed a \\"Code of Labour Practices for the Apparel Industry Including Sportswear\\" based upon the conventions of the United Nations' International Labour Organization. The principles set forth in this code include, among others, a minimum employment age, safe working requirements, set working hours and right to a living wage. The CCC pressures retailers and manufacturers to adopt the Code of Labour Practices and ensure that the principles are upheld. Successful campaigning by the CCC has led many businesses to adopt ‚Äúcodes of conduct,‚Äù a list of standards for suppliers. The CCC pushes companies to give these codes real meaning by reinforcing them with a commitment to monitoring conditions and resolving problems. The CCC also presses companies to ensure that their buying practices, such as pricing and delivery schedules, do not make it unfeasible for factories to provide decent work. =Support to workers= The Clean Clothes Campaign provides solidarity support in urgent cases of labor and human rights violations. The CCC communicates with companies and public authorities, requesting positive intervention and resolution. If companies fail to take adequate steps to resolve problems, the CCC mobilizes consumers and activists around the world to take action. The CCC has taken up more than 250 cases involving discrimination against union members and officials, unsafe working conditions, withholding of wages and social premiums, violence against workers, and violations of worker's human rights. =Consumer education= The CCC publicizes through educational programmes, demonstrations, advertisement, debates, books, rallies and news outlets information related to the production of clothes and the misuse of garment workers. =Legal advocacy= The Clean Clothes Campaign calls on the European Union and national governments to promote respect for international labour standards. It lobbies governments to be responsible consumers themselves by committing to the ethical procurement of government uniforms and work wear.

Stephens, born in Chicago, is believed to have been the longest-serving mayor in the United States at the time of his death. He was in the middle of serving his thirteenth consecutive four-year term as mayor of the suburban Cook County village; he almost exceeded the Illinois record for longest-serving mayor, set by Frank Caliper of Colp. He had served as mayor since its incorporation in 1956. Prior to that, he had been the president of the homeowner's association of the neighborhood that later became known as Rosemont. During his tenure, Rosemont grew from a tiny community of only 85 to one of Illinois' most politically important communities, with over 4,000 residents as well as the nation's tenth-largest convention center. Stephens also oversaw the construction of the 18,500 seat Allstate Arena (formerly the Rosemont Horizon) and the Rosemont Theatre. Stephens' political career was dogged by accusations of association with organized crime, which led to the only major political defeat in his career: the revocation of a state-issued casino license for Rosemont. In 1983, Stephens was indicted, in separate prosecutions, for tax fraud and bribery, but was acquitted on both charges. Stephens was also an avid collector of Hummel figurines and established a museum holding his collection in Rosemont. The Donald E. Stephens Museum of Hummels claims to be the largest public display of Hummel figurines in the world. Stephens died in Rosemont on April 18, 2007, of complications of stomach cancer.

Nicola Francesco Haym (6 July 1678 ‚Äì 31 July 1729) was an Italian opera librettist, composer, theatre manager and performer, literary editor and numismatist. He is best remembered for adapting texts into libretti for the London operas of George Frideric Handel and Giovanni Bononcini. Libretti that he provided for Handel included those for Giulio Cesare, Ottone, Flavio, Tamerlano, Rodelinda, and several others; for Bononcini, he produced two, Calfurnia and Astianatte.  Compositions  Haym was born in Rome. His career began as a cellist in Italy, and he arrived in London in 1701: he swiftly became master of the 2nd Duke of Bedford's chamber music. He wrote the libretto for Bononcini's Camilla, a seminal work of enormous success that did much to establish Italian opera in London. Later, when operas in London came to be performed entirely in Italian, rather than in a bilingual blend of English and Italian, Haym spent much time adapting both libretti and music for the many pasticcios that were staged at this time. In 1720 he was employed as a continuo cellist for the new Royal Academy of Music; in 1722, however, he became the Academy's Secretary for its final six seasons: he not only wrote the libretti but also took on the role of stage manager during this time. Prior to his death in London in 1729, he was planning to assist Handel and Heidegger construct a new Academy after the demise of the old one.  Publishing work  A drawing of publishers' fleurons by Haym. Haym was a collector of paintings and engravings and made drawings himself. In 1719-29 Haym published a catalogue of ancient Greek and Roman coins and medals Del tesoro britannico parte prima,Google Books the first work on the ancient coins in the collection of the British Museum. This was illustrated with his own drawings. He was also the author of Biblioteca Italiana, o sia Notizia de' Libri Rari nella lingua Italiana, a bibliography of Italian books from the beginning of printing to about 1715. Published in London in 1726 and reprinted in Venice in 1728 and 1741, the work was originally intended to list only rare books. However, subsequent editors, beginning with Angelo Geremia, so enlarged the work that it came to be considered a general bibliography of Italian literature. It is arranged in sections, beginning with history and geography, then poetry, followed by prose writings, and a final extensive section on arts and sciences, including grammar, linguistics, history of art, philosophy, politics and political history, mathematics, and astronomy. The format of the cited books is given, in addition to some indication of rarity and advice on the best edition. A much enlarged edition was published in Milan in 1771-72 by Federico Giandonati, and the work was the standard bibliography of Italian literature until the nineteenth century. It served as a model for Giuseppe Baretti's The Italian Library (London, 1757); some claimed that Baretti \\"pillaged\\" Haym's work.

With over 500,000 of his textbooks in print,Article regarding textbook sales Dr. Simpson is considered as an expert in the teaching of electronics and electronics simulation technology.Technology Trends Article He has won numerous awards including the Award of Excellence from the Association of Canadian Community Colleges (ACCC),ACCC document with article regarding Simpson's Electronics Technician distance education program the TVOntario Lifelong Learning Challenge Award, and the Codie award from the Software Publishers Association. Simpson holds two patents in electronics laboratory simulation and control systems technology, and is recognized as an authority on distance education and the integration of laboratory simulation software. He has been interviewed by the CBC, PBS, CTV, TVOntario, The Globe and Mail, Toronto Star, Chicago Tribune, and has lectured at universities around the world. Simpson has a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Hawaii and a Doctorate of Letters from Nipissing University.Education reference Early years During his tenure as an electronics professor at George Brown College in Toronto, Simpson found that students who were financially disadvantaged and unable to purchase electronics simulation software were achieving poorer grades than their counterparts who were able to purchase such products. At the time, simulation software was prohibitively expensive for a typical student, and Simpson decided to develop his own electronics circuit simulation and make it available free of charge to all students. Simpson approached computer programmer John (Bud) Skinner with this idea, and development work began on a product that ultimately became CircuitLogix. As a result of using this software students grades improved significantly, and it has also removed a very divisive issue from the classroom. In 2005, Simpson launched the commercial version of CircuitLogix called CircuitLogix Pro and in 2012 it reached the milestone of 250,000 licensed users, and became the first electronics simulation product to have a global installed base of a quarter-million customers in over 100 countries.Article regarding user base Simpson was one of the first electronics professors to use simulation software, and his fourth book, Principles of Electronics, was written specifically for use with simulation software. At the time, there was considerable opposition among the electronics education community regarding the use of simulation software for the delivery of electronics curriculum. Many educators felt that a \\"hands on\\" methodology was the only valid method of learning electronics, and that simulation was a less- effective substitute. Simpson embarked on a series of lectures, conference presentations and meetings with accrediting organizations throughout 1996, where he demonstrated that electronics simulation software could achieve identical results to laboratory experiments performed with real equipment.Popular Electronics Magazine, The New Virtual World of Electronics Laboratories, pp. 3-5, Gernsbeck Publishing, New York, October, 1996 In 1997, Simpson's Electronics Technician distance education program (ET) received approval and accreditation from the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities (MTCU). In its first year, the program enrolled over 500 students from 17 countries, with over 30 companies sponsoring employees, and has since become the largest distance education program of its kind in the world. With over 10,000 students studying electronics at a distance, Simpson's ET distance education program has effectively broken down the barriers that prevent students from accessing technical course material on-line. Of note is that the program has broken the gender barrier in the study of electronics. Typically, less than 2% of students who study electronics in Colleges and Universities are female. In the ET distance education program almost 20% of the student's are female, which has been attributed to the accessibility of the learning material and the integrative multimedia courseware which is designed to scaffold student learning and accommodate learning style differences. The asynchronous learning methodology of Simpson's online technical programs have also attracted a large percentage of mature students who are in their 40s and 50s and require greater flexibility in their studies. Interview regarding Mature Students Robotics and beyond right In 2008, Simpson published his book, Introduction to Robotics. He also oversaw the development of a new robotics simulator software package, RoboLogix,RoboLogix/Robotics Interview which was completed in 2009 and was designed by John (Bud) Skinner using specifications derived from Simpson's research in robotics, algorithms, and simulation technologies. In 2009, Simpson launched the Robotics Technician online program,http://www.automation.com/content/online-robotics-training- program which presently has over 800 students in 15 countries. In recent years, Simpson has continued his work in simulation and control systems and in 2006, launched the online PLC Technician program, which was based on his book, Programmable Logic Controllers. The program is now the largest of its kind in the world and provides training to employees in over 100 companies.Online program popularity In 2013, Simpson and Skinner released their first PLC simulation product, PLCLogix, which is designed to simulate the operation of Rockwell Automation's Logix 5000 PLC and is featured in the online PLC Technician program.http://www.automation.com/automation-news/george-brown- college-offers-online-plc-training One of the main features of PLCLogix is its ability to simulate real world manufacturing environments using interactive 3D animations. These interactive animations are based on Simpson's Programmable Logic Controllers textbook and range from traffic lights to batch mixing to production lines and feature bipeds and other avatars that operate in the various worlds. The integration of ladder programs with these 3D worlds provides a method for programming using real-time computing and observing the operation of complex control devices and systems. In 2014, Simpson and Skinner released LogixSim, which is a software suite consisting of CircuitLogix, RoboLogix, PLCLogix, and 3DLab. LogixSim's versatility and wide range of simulation capabilities has made it very popular as an educational technology resource in Colleges and Universities.Description of LogixSim In 2015, Simpson launched his sixth online program, Automation Technician, which uses LogixSim to provide training in automation and control systems including electro-mechanics, robotics and PLCs.Automation Program referenceSimpson Interviewed re new automation program Personal life Colin Simpson was born in North Bay, Ontario to parents of British heritage.

Once he \\"retired\\" from the music business at the age of 26, he pursued this love of electronics as a professor, author, inventor, and innovator.Innovative partnerships in Education Awards In 1996, Simpson and Joe Koenig were joint recipients of the Award of Excellence, from the Software Publishers AssociationPopular Electronics magazine, The New Virtual World of Electronics Laboratories, pp. 3-5, Gernsbeck Publishing, New York, October, 1996 for their work in simulation technologies and multimedia. In 1998, Simpson's electronics program received the Program Excellence Award, from the Association of Canadian Community Colleges, a consortium of 155 Colleges. It was the first time a distance education program had earned this award and was noted by ACCC President, Gerald Brown, as a \\"landmark achievement in the field of distance education\\".ACCC document with article regarding Simpson's Electronics Technician distance education program In 2003, Simpson's Electronics Technician program received a $1 million grant from the Government of Ontario for the development of a \\"virtual campus\\" to support students who were enrolled in 85 cities and towns throughout the province.

It was established by international treaty by the Dutch government and the Flemish government in Belgium, for the purpose of ensuring the quality of higher education in the Netherlands and Flanders by accrediting study programmes. The Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO) was established in 2005 by the Dutch and Flemish governments as an independent accreditation organisation tasked with providing an expert and objective assessment of the quality of higher education in the Netherlands and Flanders. NVAO is an international body established by treaty, which is recognised as a legal entity under Dutch public law, in accordance with the Treaty of 3 September 2003 between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Flemish Community of Belgium concerning the accreditation of Dutch and Flemish higher education programmes. Legal framework The Dutch and Flemish accreditation systems stem from the agreements reached among the European Ministers of Education to establish a European Higher Education Area (EHEA). In the European regions concerned, they agreed to establish a Bachelor's/Master's degree structure in higher education and to introduce an independent accreditation system. The Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Flemish Community of Belgium signed a Treaty on 3 September 2003 concerning the accreditation of Dutch and Flemish higher education programmes in order to establish a common accreditation organisation. As of 1 February 2005, the independent Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO) became an international body established by treaty that has the status of a legal entity under Dutch public law. The tasks and work method of NVAO in the Netherlands and in Flanders are set down in legislation. In the Netherlands, the tasks of NVAO are based on the \\"Higher Education and Research Act\\" (Wet Hoger Onderwijs en Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, WHW), in Flanders, the operation of NVAO is established by the \\"Decree on Higher Education\\" of 4 April 2003. International policy NVAO exchanges ideas and collaborates with stakeholders, such as governments, universities of applied sciences (NL) / university colleges (FL), research universities, and representatives of student organisations and umbrella organisations in the Netherlands, Flanders, Europe and beyond concerning the quality and the quality assurance of (international) higher education. NVAO is recognised and accredited as a bi- national accreditation organisation. It performs its tasks in an international perspective, within the context of the European Bologna process and in accordance with the European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance. At European level NVAO is registered in the European Quality Assurance Register for Higher Education (EQAR); member, Board member, and providing the secretariat of the European Consortium for Accreditation in higher education (ECA); full member of the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA); full member of the International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education (INQAAHE). Criticism Some commentators are sceptical about the usefulness of NVAO and similar accreditation organs. Thus Bram Delen, student at the KU Leuven even calls it a \\"classical example of useless bureaucracy\\",\\"Schoolvoorbeld van nutteloze bureaucratie.\\" writing in the student paper Veto that the funds spent by NVAO on the \\"validation\\" of the work of visitation committees could have been better spent on the core tasks of the university, namely research, teaching and social service. Prof. Arnold Heertje and Anne Marie Oudemans have argued, in response to an appeal by Karl Dittrich, former Chair of NVAO, that the process bureaucracy of NVAO is swallowing up substantial funds, especially in the field of Higher Professional Education, without producing reliable results. But a full debate on the role and effects of the operation of NVAO has yet to take place.

From 1952 to 1955 he was a Research Fellow at St John‚Äôs working in a team led by Maurice Wilkes; the research involved pioneering work with the EDSAC computer in the Cavendish Laboratory. In 1952 he developed a very early computer game. It involved a dot (termed a sheep) approaching a line in which one of two gates could be opened. The game was controlled via the lightbeam of the EDSAC's paper tape reader. Interrupting it (such as by the player placing their hand in it) would open the upper gate. Leaving the beam unbroken would result in the lower gate opening. He gained PhD in 1953 and, following a year as Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana, joined the Computer Department at Ferranti Ltd. In the UK in 1963 he was appointed Professor of Automatic Data Processing, UMIST, Manchester and, following various consultancies including International Computers Ltd he was appointed in 1964 to the newly created Chair of Computing Science and Computing Unit at Imperial College, University of London. This was later merged into the Imperial College Centre for Computing and Automation, which Gill became director of, whilst he worked as a consultant to the Ministry of Technology. Gill was a founding member of the Real Time Club in 1967 and its chairman from 1970 to 1975. In 1970 he became Chairman of Software Sciences Holdings Ltd and was Director of various companies in the Miles Roman Group. From 1972 until his death in 1975 he was Senior Consultant to PA International Management Consultants Ltd. Gill travelled widely and advised on the establishment of departments of computing in several universities around the world. He was also President of the British Computer Society from 1967 to 1968.

Her father Carl Rivalier descended from a family of French Huguenots, and received the title of Baron of Meysenbug from William I of Hesse-Kassel. The ninth of ten children, she broke with her family because of her political convictions. Two of her brothers made brilliant careers, one as a minister of state in Austria, and the other as Minister of the Karlsruhe. Von Meysenbug, however, refused to appeal to her family and lived first by joining a free community in Hamburg, and then by immigrating in 1852 to England where she lived by teaching and translating works. There, she met the republicans Ledru-Rollin, Louis Blanc, and Gottfried Kinkel, all political refugees; the young Carl Schurz also became acquainted with her there. In 1862 von Meysenbug went to Italy with Olga Herzen, the daughter of Alexander Herzen, known as the \\"father of Russian socialism\\" (and whose daughters she taught) and resided there. Olga Herzen married Gabriel Monod in 1873 and established herself in France, but Malwida's poor health obstructed her from joining her.

Biography  The son of Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach (1907-1967) and Anneliese (nee Bahr) Lampert (1909-1998) (married 1937-divorced 1941); Arndt von Bohlen, Lutheran by birth and tradition, famously waived his inheritance in 1966 and thus was no longer the owner of the company Friedrich Krupp AG. Instead, his father created the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation. However, Arndt agreed with receiving a yearly appanage of 2 million DM. Because he waived his inheritance, he was also not allowed to use the family name Krupp, which was reserved to the sole inheritor of the family business. Despite being notoriously homosexual, like his great-grandfather Friedrich Alfred Krupp, on 14 February 1969, he married Princess Henriette von Auersperg, the daughter of Prince Alois von Auersperg and the Countess Henrietta Larisch von M√∂ennich. The couple had no children. Owing to generous compensation and appanage Arndt was able to live the jet-set life, flying constantly between Miami and Marrakesh. In 1982, he converted from Lutheran Protestantism to the Roman Catholic faith.http://strangeflowers.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/the-last-krupp/ He died at the age of 48 in the Klinikum Gro√ühadern in Munich of jaw cancer. He had been an alcoholic for a long time and was deeply in debt at the time of his death. In his book LIFE, Keith Richards stated that Arndt was a regular party companion in Marrakech.

Armin Mohler Life Born in Basel, Mohler studied art history, German studies and philosophy at the University of Basel, where he briefly supported communism. At the age of 20, he was called up to the Swiss army, but his reading of the works of Oswald Spengler as well as the June 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union made him defect to Nazi Germany, which he supported, in 1942. He tried to join the Waffen SS, but he was not trusted by the SS authorities, who refused to accept him. He nevertheless remained in Berlin for another year before returning to Switzerland, where he was incarcerated for desertion. After World War II, he returned to study in Berlin and completed his doctoral thesis Die Konservative Revolution in Deutschland 1918-1932 (The Conservative Revolution in Germany, 1918-1932), under the supervision of Karl Jaspers in 1949. The aim of his thesis, whose fame helped spread the popularity of the concept of \\"Conservative Revolution\\", was not only scientific but also providing old traditions for new pathways for new right-wing in post-war Germany. In the same year, he worked as a secretary for his idol Ernst J√ºnger but increasingly felt that J√ºnger had become too moderate for his taste after the end of the war. Mohler went on to work as a correspondent journalist in Paris for Die Zeit, from 1953 to 1961. After that he lived in Munich, leading the Carl Friedrich von Siemens Foundation. For a brief period he worked as a speech writer for Franz Josef Strau√ü, but his influence on him was rather marginal. In 1967, he became the first to receive the Konrad Adenauer Prize, which provoked strong media attacks on him. In 1970, he became a major contributing editor to Caspar von Schrenck-Notzing's conservative monthly magazine Criticon, Germany's most important platform for non-mainstream conservative thought for almost three decades. He actively promoted French Nouvelle Droite philosopher Alain de Benoist in the 1980s and remained an unrepentant fascist until the end of his life. Mohler died in Munich in 2003, at the age of 83. Writings and ideas Mohler's seminal work is his book Die Konservative Revolution in Deutschland 1918-1932 (\\"The Conservative Revolution in Germany, 1918-1932\\"), which initially was his doctoral thesis. There, he tried to unearth Weimar Republic right-wing thought and tradition apart from and alternative to National Socialism. The most crucial thinkers of the \\"Conservative Revolution\\" to him were Ernst J√ºnger, Oswald Spengler, Carl Schmitt, Ernst Niekisch, Hans Bl√ºher and Thomas Mann (before his turn to liberalism). Mohler was one of the first German publishers to write about the ideas of his long-time friend Alain de Benoist, who founded the Nouvelle Droite. Similar as Benoist, Mohler advocated a Right that would oppose both socialism and liberalism, with a decided emphasis on the latter. According to Michael Minkenberg, Mohler's ideas owed more to the Nouvelle Droite associated with GRECE than the Ostpolitik-derived ideas of a strong German state that was associated with contemporaries like Robert Spaemann and Gerd-Klaus Kaltenbrunner.M. Minkenberg, 'The New Right in France and Germany: Nouvelle Droite, Neue Rechte, and the New Right Radical Parties', P. H. Merkl & L Weinberg (eds.), The Revival of Right Wing Extremism in the Nineties, London: Frank Cass, 1997, pp. 73-4 One of his favourite targets was the so-called \\"Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung\\", which he criticized in several books. That argument involved the claim that postwar Germany should 'step out of Hitler's shadow'. It was thus claimed that Mohler was a forerunner of Ernst Nolte and associated thinkers, who were involved in the Historikerstreit.Prelude, Interlude, Afterlude. Spotlights on German Debates In the 1950s, Mohler contributed to journals such as Nation Europa and Die Tat (not to be confused with an older paper of the same title). He also wrote for mainstream newspapers such as Die Zeit and (in the 1960s and 1970s) Die Welt. In his later years, he supported the \\"Neue Rechte\\" weekly paper Junge Freiheit. Under the alias 'Michael Hintermwald,' he also contributed two articles to Gerhard Frey's Deutschen National-Zeitung for which he was much criticized. Political activism Mohler was initially a supporter of Franz Josef Strau√ü and the Christian Social Union of Bavaria but later worked with Franz Sch√∂nhuber in the founding of The Republicans. Fascism Mohler's notion of Conservative Revolution has been described by some, like Roger Griffin, as fascism.R. Griffin, The Nature of Fascism, London : Routledge, 1993, pp. 166-9 In a newspaper interview, Mohler accepted that he was a fascist but only in the tradition of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera and with the acceptance of the notion that fascism had its roots in the far left, as argued by Zeev Sternhell.

He played a prominent role in the Thirty Years' War, raising a regiment of 3,000 men, which served in both the Danish and Swedish forces. He was later an unwilling Covenanter. He was the fourteenth chief of Clan Mackay, a Highland Scottish clan. Early life Donald Mackay was the eldest son of Huistean Du Mackay, 13th of Strathnaver, and wife Lady Jane Gordon, eldest daughter of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, and second wife Lady Jean Gordon. Military career =Clan feuds in Scotland= Allan Cameron of Lochiel, chief of the Clan Cameron came into much trouble due to the claims of superiority made over him by the rival houses of the Earl of Argyll (chief of Clan Campbell) and the Earl of Huntly (chief of Clan Gordon). Cameron was initially a supporter of Huntly, but later transferred his allegiance over to Argyll. Huntly brought the matter before the Privy Council of Scotland who issued a commission to Fraser the Lord Lovat, Mackenzie of Gairloch, Mackenzie of Kintail and Mackay of Farr for the apprehension of Allan Cameron. Donald Mackay took part in the subsequent operations together with his uncle Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet, and with 300 men they proceeded as far as the town of Inverness in August, 1612 and again on 9 December 1613. A levy of Mackays and Gordons having been summoned from the north by the Council to pursue Allan Cameron. In the second expedition Donald Mackay and Gordon of Embo marched with 450 men into the heart of Lochaber to co-operate with other troops. However, Allan Cameron, with the help of the Earl of Argyll, managed to hold his own. Between the years 1612 and 1623 a feud was fought between Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet who was tutor to his nephew the Earl of Sutherland, against the Earl of Caithness (chief of Clan Sinclair). Gordon tried to get Donald Mackay to join him in his campaign against the Earl of Caithness, but Mackay took no part in it. In April 1616 Donald Mackay went to London with his uncle, Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet, and was knighted by the king. On 20 August 1623, Sir Donald McKay of Strathnaver was appointed by the Privy Council of Scotland a Justice of the Peace for Sutherland and Strathnaver. On 11 November 1623 the inhabitants of Strathnaver petitioned to the Council through Mackay to be exempted from the prohibition to carry fire-arms, which had previously been passed against the inhabitants of the diocese of Caithness, and as such they had not been able to defend themselves against Sir Robert Gordon. =Thirty Years' War= A 17thC German print assumed to show men of Donald Mackay's Regiment in Stettin during the Thirty Years' War. The original caption states, \\"They are a strong and hardy people who survive on little food. If they have no bread, they eat roots [turnips may be intended]. When necessary, they can cover more than 20 German miles in a day's forced march. [1 German mile = 4¬æ English miles] Besides muskets, they carry bows, quivers and long swords.\\" In 1626 Sir Donald Mackay embarked with 3000 men at Cromarty under Count Mansfeld for the Thirty Years' War in the service of the king of Denmark alongside their colonel, Robert Monro. In March 1627 Sir Donald Mackay was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia,Way, George and Squire, Romily. (1994). pp. 224 - 225. and in 1628 was elevated in the peerage as Lord Reay. In 1630 Donald Mackay, 1st Lord Reay accompanied his regiment to Germany, and was present at the capture of Stettin and Colberg. The following year in 1631 Lord Reay was empowered by Charles I of England to raise another force of men for service with Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden. He quarreled with David Ramsay at the English Court and, having challenged him to a duel, both were imprisoned in the Tower of London to preserve the peace. During 1632 Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden was killed at the Battle of L√ºtzen and Lord Reay was not repaid large sums of money due to him by the king. =Civil War= In 1638 James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose and the Lords Home, Boyd and Loudoun invited Donald Mackay, 1st Lord Reay to meet them and others to consider the religious troubles of the time and to sign the Covenant, which he did unwillingly, along with his son, John Mackay, Master of Reay, because of his long attachment to Charles I. In 1644, like Montrose, Lord Reay again espouses the cause of Charles I of England in the English Civil War, and aided Lord Crawford for several months at the Siege of Newcastle, in the defence of the city against the Scots army. When the town was captured by General Leslie, Lord Reay and Lord Crawford were sent as prisoners to Edinburgh Castle. In 1645 following Montrose's victory at the Battle of Kilsyth, Lord Reay was liberated from imprisonment and returned home. In January 1649 Charles I was executed. Donald Mackay, 1st Lord Reay having fought for Charles I during the civil war was to be created Earl of Strathnaver but the royal patent was not completed and Reay went into exile in Denmark where he died in February 1649.

Following in the footsteps of his elder brothers he was educated at St Columba's College, Rathfarnham and Trinity College, Dublin. Like the three brothers immediately preceding him, Lucius, Arthur and Robin, he was an outstanding cricketer, and like them he in his turn captained first the St Columba's XI and then the Dublin University XI. He did not however go on to represent the Ireland cricket team internationally. After graduating Jack Gwynn joined the Indian Civil Service. He started his first tour of duty in India in 1905. During a period of home leave Jack became engaged to Joan Sedding, a relative through marriage of his elder brother Lucius. Joan's father was the ecclesiastical architect John Sedding. Both of Joan's parents had died while Joan was in her infancy and she had been brought up by a maternal aunt and uncle, the Rawlinsons; her cousin Katharine, the one who had married Lucius Gwynn, was like an elder sister to her and probably had a hand in arranging the match. Jack and Joan's wedding took place in Colombo in 1912.Oral testimony, Edward Liddle, grandson of John Tudor Gwynn While working in the Indian Civil Service Jack Gwynn represented the \\"Europeans\\" in two first-class matches against the \\"Indians\\" in 1919 and 1920.First-class matches played by John Gwynn at Cricket Archive At the outbreak of the first World War Jack and Joan Gwynn were on home leave. Jack was retained in London and placed on special duty at the Admiralty. It was during this period in England that the couple's three children were born: Peter (1916-1999), Rose (1918-2012) and Katharine (1920-2008). Jack Gwynn had to retire from the ICS in 1921 because of deafness. However he had no sooner retired than the Manchester Guardian newspaper head-hunted him and sent him back to India as their correspondent. He wrote a series of articles for the paper which, in 1924, were published in book form under the title Indian Politics.The Spectator, 5 September 1924 Gwynn was still working for the Guardian when he and his family moved to Dublin in 1926. Apart from a break when he covered the Round Table Conference in 1934 - he already knew Mahatma Gandhi and had a great admiration for him - he served as the Irish correspondent of the Guardian until 1936. He continued to review occasional books for the paper until a year or two before his death. In 1936 Jack Gwynn became the Headmaster of a boys‚Äô preparatory school on the north side of Dublin, Baymount School, which he had bought from its founder William Scott. He and his wife ran the school successfully for a decade in spite of financial difficulties. Baymount School was closed down in 1948. A couple of years later Gwynn put the house and grounds up for sale. They were purchased by the Society of Jesus and subsequently converted into a Jesuit retreat named Manresa House. Jack and Joan Gwynn stayed for a while in Clontarf, near Baymount, before moving to live with their daughter and son-in- law, Katharine and Laurence Liddle, in Bangor, County Down in 1953.

Signs and symptoms The most common clinical finding is hepatosplenomegaly. Pruritus, gout, and mucocutaneous bleeding are occasionally seen. Cause The cause of CNL is currently unknown. An association between CNL and multiple myeloma has been suggested based on the observation of myeloma in 20% of CNL cases. However, a clonal genetic abnormality has not been detected in these myeloma-associated cases of CNL, raising the possibility that the neutrophilia is a reaction due to the neoplastic myeloma cells. The postulated cell of origin is a limited- potential, marrow-derived stem cell. Genetics The majority (90%) of cases have not had detectable cytogenetic abnormalities. Most importantly, the Philadelphia chromosome and other BCR/ABL fusion genes are not detected. Diagnosis =Laboratory findings= Peripheral blood neutrophilia (> 25 x 109/L) with myeloid precursors (promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes) comprising less than 5% of leukocytes. =Sites of involvement= Peripheral blood, bone marrow, spleen, and liver are most common, but any organ or tissue can be infiltrated by neutrophils. Bone marrow biopsy On both the bone marrow aspirate and the core biopsy, a hypercellular marrow with an increased myeloid:erythroid ratio of 20:1 or greater. Myelocytes and neutrophils are increased, and blasts and promyelocytes are not increased. Due to the myeloproliferative nature of the disease, an increase in megakaryocytes and erythroid precursors may be observed, but dyspoiesis in not seen in any cell lineage. Also, reticulin fibrosis is rare. There is a reported association between CNL and multiple myeloma, so the bone marrow biopsy may show evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia with increased numbers of atypical plasma cells. Spleen Splenic infiltrates are typically found only in the red pulp. Liver Hepatic infiltrates can be found in either the sinusoids, portal triad regions, or both. =Immunophenotype= No distinct immunophenotype abnormality for CNL has been described. See OHSU 2013 findings of gene CSF3R, mutation p. T6181 Epidemiology This is a rare disease, with less than 100 cases reported. Of these cases, an equal male:female ratio was observed, with cases typically seen in older adults.

Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 29, Ives, John retrieved December 2017 He was born in Great Yarmouth, the son of another John Ives, a wealthy merchant. He was baptized at a Congregationalist church and it was from a Congregationalist minister that he received his earliest educational instruction. He was planning to attend Gonville and Caius College but went to work in his father's counting-house in 1767. Due to his father's wealth, Ives did not need to take a job, and his growing interest in British antiquities made it undesirable. Ives was elected as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 13 June 1771. Shortly thereafter, Ives began to assemble material for a history of Lothingland, the north-easternmost part of Suffolk. This was never published, but a manuscript version of it, entitled Collectanea Lothinglandia or The History and Antiquities of the Hundred of Lothingland can be found in the British Library. Ives was also able to spend time as a collector, thanks to his father's resources. He was also able to acquire a private press around the beginning of 1772. With this, he produced a printed copy of the baptismal and burial registers of Great Yarmouth for the preceding nine years in dated 5 September 1772. Ives's Seal as Suffolk Herald Extraordinary Ives was made a fellow of the Royal Society on 25 March 1773. That summer, he eloped with Sarah Kett at Lambeth on 16 July 1773. In October 1774 Ives was appointed Suffolk Herald of Arms Extraordinary at the College of Arms. As an officer extraordinary, he did not receive automatic access to the College's records. However, he was corresponding with John Charles Brooke, then Rouge Croix Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary, which indicates that Ives was friendly with the officers in ordinary. He died of consumption at Great Yarmouth on 9 January 1776. He was buried with his family in Belton church. In accordance with his will, his collections were auctioned in the spring of 1777 in London, the proceeds going to Sarah, his widow. See also *Heraldry *Pursuivant *Herald References * Walter H.

He helped write For Those in Peril and followed this with a comedy, Fiddlers Three (1944) starring Tommy Trinder. Balcon sent Watt to Australia to find a subject for the film. The result was The Overlanders (1946) which was a big hit and helped make a star of Chips Rafferty. It inspired Ealing to set up production in Australia. However the follow up, Eureka Stockade (1949), was not a success. Watt went to East Africa on a similar mission to the one he had for The Overlanders ‚Äì travel around the country, and find a subject for a film.

The organisation has been active since 1997.  History  In 1979, the association Austrian Information Service for International Development Policy (√ñsterreichischer Informationsdienst f√ºr Entwicklungspolitik; √ñIE) was founded with the conviction to promote the idea of development policy in Austria. Church organizations, the Austrian Students' Association, the Europahaus Eisenstadt, youth organizations (SJ & JVP) and an array of development policy focused research groups united to tackle this endeavour. Toward the end of the 1990s the √ñIE was renamed to ‚ÄúS√ºdwind Entwicklungspolitik‚Äù and the ‚ÄúS√ºdwind Agency‚Äù was founded as non-profit ltd. The non-profit ltd. was dissolved in 2015, from that point on S√ºdwind has been legally registered as an association. S√ºdwind's main objective is to reduce the socioeconomic imbalance between Global North and Global South. Their approach is to offer information and education in Austria, to raise awareness for global issues. Providing and producing workshops for schools, teaching material that focuses on Global Learning and Global Citizenship Education and interactive exhibitions, has been at the core of S√ºdwind's efforts for over 35 years. Organizing campaigns for a more just world, for example ‚ÄúJute statt Plastik‚Äù (1979; aimed at making people replace plastic bags with jute bags), ‚ÄúHunger ist kein Schicksal‚Äù (1980; hunger is not a destiny), ‚ÄúStimmen f√ºr den Regenwald‚Äù (1992; voices for the rainforest) and the ‚ÄúClean Clothes Campaign‚Äù (since 2001) are an essential part of S√ºdwind's activity.  Organizational Structure  S√ºdwind's structure The S√ºdwind association is the founder of Klimab√ºndnis and a stakeholder of S√ºdwind-Buchwelt and the publisher of S√ºdwind-Magazine. The association coordinates many of its projects in cooperation with various international partner organizations. S√ºdwind is represented on the board of the AG Globale Verantwortung, the network Soziale Verantortung (NESOVE) and WearFair +mehr. It is also member of the WIDE-Network and is engaged in the platforms ECA- Watch Austria, Oikocredit, the information agency for journalists & development policy (ISJE), ‚ÄúWir haben es satt!‚Äù and Baobab. S√ºdwind has also acted as coordination body for the Clean Clothes Campaign in Austria. On a regional level S√ºdwind acts through regional associations located in Styria, Vienna, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Salzburg, Tirol and Vorarlberg, of which six host a so-called Infothek. Infotheks supply the public with teaching materials, nonfiction, videos/DVDs, slide series, games, children's and youth literature etc. that revolve around the topic of international development policy. S√ºdwind's activities are mainly financed by projects. Projects are mostly funded by the Austrian Development Agency (ADA), the Austrian ministry of education, the ministry of labour, social affairs and consumer protection as well as the European Union. Additionally, donations enable part of S√ºdwind's work. Municipalities and federal provinces financially support some activities on a regional level.  Consultative Status in the United Nations Organization  Since 2009, S√ºdwind has been holding a consultative status in the Economic- and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC). The status allows S√ºdwind to organize parallel events, take part in UN conferences in Vienna, Geneva and New York City, and to utter statements and written inputs. Here, S√ºdwind's main focus lies on partaking in the United Nations Human Rights Council's (UNHRC) meetings in Geneva.  S√ºdwind-Magazin  The S√ºdwind-Magazin has been reporting on topics like international politics, culture and international development policy for over 35 years. The editors are independent. The magazine aims to report on issues and regions that are underrepresented by the media. The editorial charter determines the magazine's mission to inform the public about social, political, economic and cultural realities in so called third-world countries, about development policies and international cooperation, aiming to bridge the gap between north and south. The current representatives of the publisher are Martin J√§ggle, Brigitte Pilz and Erhard Stackl. The S√ºdwind-Magazin defines itself as an undogmatic information and discussion resource for people who strive for more justice between the Global North and the Global South and want to acquire more knowledge about international topics. The magazine appears 10 times annually and has 52 pages. It contains reports, comic-strips, analyses and interviews about topics surrounding the Global South and propositions for change in the Global North.  S√ºdwind-Buchwelt  In 1984, the first bookstore that focused on development policy was founded in Vienna and named S√ºdwind. The second part of the name is taken from the bookstore ‚ÄúBuchwelt‚Äù that merged with the S√ºdwind bookstore a couple of years later. Today a large repertoire of respective literature, world music CDs and fairtrade handicraft and foods are sold in shops in the 9th and in the 7th district of Vienna and online. The founding idea of S√ºdwind-Buchwelt was to offer better access to literature relevant to developmental policy. The bookstore is constantly engaged in synthesizing respective literature for common use, and aspires to improve industrial regions‚Äô understanding of societal, ecological and economic processes in the Global South. S√ºdwind-Buchwelt's work supplies an important fundament for numerous libraries, schools and other educational facilities by offering them useful guidelines for their choice in educational material. S√ºdwind-Buchwelt operates independently from the S√ºdwind association; the association is merely a stakeholder of S√ºdwind-Buchwelt.  Activism  S√ºdwind-Activists‚Äô main objective is to mobilize and raise awareness for global justice. They focus on topics that are relevant to S√ºdwind, but the activists also independently select global and societal issues they deem important. Their members take part in public discourse, organize events and public happenings to inform society about current developments, hold discussions about current topics and campaigns, and organize meetings throughout Austria, like for example the S√ºdwind-Academy.

The song provided listeners with new material for the first time since December 2005, and later found release on third LP Men's Needs, Women's Needs, Whatever in May 2007. Recorded at the Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia with Franz Ferdinand vocalist and guitarist Alex Kapranos, the song received additional treatment at Alchemy, London, United Kingdom. Physical release The song received a physical release in numerous forms, through two seven inch records and a CD single, in addition to digital download. Frequent band collaborator Nick Scott designed the sleeve, whereas Bob Taylor provided band photography for the releases. The release featured the catalogue numbers 'WEBB124S', 'WEBB124SX' and 'WEBB124SCD'. B-sides \\"Tonight\\", the seven-inch vinyl one B-side, came from the same sessions as the rest of the album, whereas \\"Fairer Sex\\", the CD single flip, found completion at Avatar Studios, New York City along with \\"Be Safe\\" and \\"Shoot the Poets\\".

Critical reception The song featured at number three on the NME 'Songs of the Year 2007', named 'Single of the Year' by the Metro newspaper and finished in the 'Top 100 Songs of 2007' published by Rolling Stone in the United States. In 2009, NME also named \\"Men's Needs\\" as one of the 'Songs of the Decade', saying that this took them \\"from cult favourites to one of Britain's best loved bands\\". Furthermore, in October 2011, NME placed the song at number ninety- eight on a list '150 Best Tracks of the Past Fifteen Years'.https://www.nme.com/list/150-best-tracks-of-the- past-15-years/248648/page/6 Music video Directed by Diane Martel, the video depicts the band playing \\"Men's Needs\\" in front of a yellow background. A nude woman (censored due to watershed restrictions) licks and kisses vocalist and guitarist Ryan, dances and trashes amplifiers, performs household tasks, punches the band members and interrupts proceedings. Near the middle of the video, she throws a knife at drummer Ross and severs his arm. Using Ross' severed arm she then cuts off Ryan's head, which she then holds in her arms during his guitar solo. Both have their limbs back on their bodies for the third verse. Oblivious to all these actions, the band plays on. The graphic nature of the video led to a ban on MTV2 before the watershed due to Ofcom complaints about violence and nudity. Three versions of the video exist: the first censored version as described above, a second version that shows the woman wearing a leotard and a third uncensored version.

Grant Thornton is the world's seventh-largest by revenue and sixth-largest by number of employees professional services network of independent accounting and consulting member firms which provide assurance, tax and advisory services to privately held businesses, public interest entities, and public sector entities. Grant Thornton International Ltd. is a not-for-profit, non- practising, international umbrella membership entity organised as a private company limited by guarantee. Grant Thornton International Ltd. is incorporated in London, England, and has no share capital. According to Grant Thornton International Ltd., member firms within the global organisation operate in over 130 countries employing over 56,000 personnel for a combined global revenue of US$5.72 billion.  Early history  The earliest origins of the name date back to 1904, when the UK firm of Thornton and Thornton was formed in Oxford. Through a series of name changes this firm merged in 1959 with another UK firm, Baker & Co, which traced its origins to 1868, to form the firm Thornton Baker. In 1975 Thornton Baker merged with Kidston, Jackson, McBain, a UK firm which traced its origins to the Glaswegian accountant, Robert McCowan, who set up in practice in 1844, and was a founder of the Institute of Accountants and Actuaries in Glasgow in 1853. In the US, 26-year- old Alexander Richardson Grant founded Alexander Grant & Co in Chicago in 1924. Grant had been a senior accountant with Ernst & Ernst (now EY). Alexander Grant was committed to providing services to mid-sized companies. When Grant died in 1938, Alexander Grant & Co survived the change in leadership and continued to grow nationally. In 1969, Alexander Grant & Co joined with firms from Australia, Canada, and the United States to establish the organisation of Alexander Grant Tansley Witt. This organisation operated successfully for 10 years. In 1980 Alexander Grant & Co and Thornton Baker, firms with similar qualities, clients, personnel numbers and values, joined with 49 other firms to form a global organisation, Grant Thornton. In 1986, Alexander Grant & Co and Thornton Baker changed their names to Grant Thornton, reflecting their mutual affiliation and strategic alignment.  Recent history  In December 2019 Grant Thornton placed in the top 50 global employers for diversity and inclusion (D&I;), according to a new index developed by Universum. More than 247,000 business and engineering/IT students rated Grant Thornton against support for gender equality, commitment to diversity & inclusion and respect for its people. Their perception of Grant Thornton, against these three categories, places the network 28th in the list, alongside some of the world‚Äôs most well-known and respected global brands. In 2018 Grant Thornton UK LLP, the UK member firm of the network, was fined ¬£4 million for audit misconduct after a former partner joined the audit committees of two organisations while Grant Thornton UK LLP was still auditing them. Later that year, for unrelated reasons, Grant Thornton UK LLP's chief executive Sacha Romanovitch, their first female chief executive, announced she would step down. Early in 2019 the UK member firm lost the audit of Patisserie Valerie after it failed to spot a ¬£20m accounting black hole in its books, thereby triggering an investigation by the Financial Reporting Council. In September 2019, Grant Thornton (along with other defendants) entered into a settlement agreement with VEREIT stockholders to settle pending class action litigation against Grant Thornton regarding among other things alleged violations of Section 11 of the 1933 Act (In re American Realty Capital Properties, Inc. Litigation and the remaining opt-out actions), at a cost to Grant Thornton of $49 million.\\"In re American Realty Capital Properties, Inc. Litigation; Third Class Action Complaint for Violations of the Federal Securities Laws,\\" United States District Court Southern District of New York, September 30, 2013. Recently the US firm in the network declared their highest turnover in history of $1.9 billion which was a YoY increase of 5.4% over the previous year.  Recent significant mergers  *In 1987 Grant Thornton merged with Carter Chaloner & Kearns. *Grant Thornton UK merged with RSM Robson Rhodes in July 2007.\\"Auditors join forces to take on Big Four\\", The Daily Telegraph, 28 April 2007. *Grant Thornton Russia merged with Rosexpertiza in January 2012. *Grant Thornton China merged with Ascenda CPA in January 2012. *In May 2012 Grant Thornton Australia merged with several former BDO offices in Melbourne and Sydney. *In July 2013, Grant Thornton Johannesburg merged with the local PKF member firm. *In February 2018, Grant Thornton South Africa merged with SizweNtsalubaGobodo. *In July 2018, Grant Thornton Japan added the Yusei Audit Co. and Yamada & partners Certified Public Tax Accountants‚Äô Co. to the network, bringing Grant Thornton‚Äôs total headcount in Japan to over 1,600 people with combined revenues of over USD$170 million. Although many of the firms now carry the Grant Thornton name, they are not all members of one international partnership. Each member firmGrant Thornton International Limited Member firms is a separate national entity, and governs itself and manages its administrative matters independently on a local basis. This is similar to other professional services networks. Member firms Grant Thornton member firms service international work through their local International Business Centres ‚Äî located in 40 major commercial centres throughout the world. Grant Thornton International Ltd. carries out an annual global research project: the International Business Report, which surveys the views and expectations of over 11,500 privately held businesses across 40 economies.  Controversies and criticisms  ¬£3m fines for audits of Nichols plc and the University of Salford The UK's Financial Reporting Council (FRC) fined Grant Thornton ¬£4m, later reduced to ¬£3m, for misconduct over its audits of Nichols plc and the University of Salford. Three partners were given personal fines of ¬£60,000. Resignation of chief executive after an anonymous attack In 2018 Sacha Romanovitch, Grant Thornton‚Äôs CEO, resigned after anonymous criticism by partners. Her annual performance review was leaked to the news media, and an unsigned complaint said she had ‚Äúmisdirected‚Äù the firm, was pursuing a ‚Äúsocialist agenda‚Äù and that the firm was ‚Äúout of control‚Äù. Regulator‚Äôs criticism of Grant Thornton‚Äôs audits In its 2019 annual review, the FRC called Grant Thornton‚Äôs work ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù, saying it was the worst performer of the UK‚Äôs major accountants. Four of the eight audits it examined for 2017/18 needed significant improvement. The UK regulator subsequently put Grant Thornton into special measures. CEO‚Äôs view of auditing In January 2019 the company‚Äôs chief executive, David Dunckley, told UK Members of Parliament it was not his firm‚Äôs job to uncover fraud or to judge whether a company‚Äôs financial figures were correct. Discussing the company‚Äôs failure to uncover fraud at Patisserie Valerie, he said: ‚ÄúIf people are colluding and there is a sophisticated fraud, that may not be caught by normal audit procedures.‚Äù Rachel Reeves MP said ‚ÄúBut in a shop that sells tea and cakes, you‚Äôd sort of think that might be spotted. It‚Äôs not a multinational complex organisation.‚Äù She also said that the FRC‚Äôs rules require auditors to spot material misstatements where they are due to fraud or error. Investigation into Interserve audits In 2019 the FRC instituted an investigation into Grant Thornton‚Äôs audits of the failed outsourcing company Interserve between 2015 and 2017. Interserve had amassed debts of ¬£738m following numerous acquisitions, a failed probation service contract and an investment in energy- from-waste plants. ¬£650,000 fine for the audit of an unnamed company The Financial Reporting Council fined Grant Thornton ¬£650,000 over a series of errors in its 2016 audit of an unnamed company. It found that the auditor had failed to adequately gauge the true value of the company‚Äôs assets, before flagging them as a ‚Äúsignificant risk‚Äù. The regulator said the firm had selected too small a sample size and had placed ‚Äúundue reliance‚Äù on the externally appointed experts rather than its own specialist. The FRC also said the auditor had failed ‚Äúto exercise sufficient professional scepticism and to prepare adequate audit documentation.‚Äù Audit of Sports Direct The FRC conducted an investigation into Grant Thornton‚Äôs 2016 audit of Sports Direct. The sports retailer used Barlin Delivery to deliver merchandise to its customers, and in the process made large undisclosed payments to Barlin, which was owned by John Ashley, the brother of Sports Direct‚Äôs owner Mike Ashley. The FRC examined Grant Thornton‚Äôs failure to disclose the relationship between Sports Direct and Barlin. In 2020 the UK Court of Appeal determined that Sports Direct did not have to disclose 40 documents sought by the FRC because they were covered by legal privilege. Ethical failures over the audits of Conviviality Retail The FRC fined the company ¬£1.95m for ethical failures after it tried to conceal evidence of involvement in the audit of the failed alcohol retailer Conviviality Retail. The regulator found that the company had not maintained an independent stance during the audit and had committed ‚Äúfirm- wide‚Äù ethical failings between 2014 and 2017. Senior manager Natasha Toy was severely reprimanded after she tried to remove an entry from the audit file which indicated involvement. Brighthouse liquidation After being appointed as the liquidator of the failed retailer Brighthouse, Grant Thornton was accused of maximising returns to creditors at the expense of vulnerable customers. The company was found to be offering the 140,000 rent-to-own customers an initial 28-day payment holiday, one-third of the period recommended by the FCA. Mick McAteer, co-founder of the Financial Inclusion Centre thinktank, said: ‚ÄúThere is a potential conflict between the interests of the administrator ‚Äì and those they represent ‚Äì and the vulnerable customers who owe money to BrightHouse.\\" ¬£26m damages to Assetco Grant Thornton was ordered pay ¬£21 million, the second-largest award against a UK auditor, in damages to its former client AssetCo, a fire engine leasing company, plus ¬£5 million to pay Assetco‚Äôs legal costs. The judge found it had committed negligence ‚Äúof the utmost gravity‚Äù. An appeal judge reduced the damages to ¬£20.8m, before a 25% deduction for contributory negligence.

For example, if a regular continued fraction is given by : x = [a_0; a_1, a_2, a_3, \\\\dots] = a_0 + \\\\cfrac{1}{a_1 + \\\\cfrac{1}{a_2 + \\\\cfrac{1}{a_3 + \\\\cfrac{1}{\\\\ddots}}}}, then the successive complete quotients Œ∂ k are given by : \\\\begin{align} \\\\zeta_0 & = [a_0; a_1, a_2, a_3, \\\\dots] \\\\zeta_1 & = [a_1; a_2, a_3, a_4, \\\\dots] \\\\zeta_2 & = [a_2; a_3, a_4, a_5, \\\\dots] \\\\zeta_k & = [a_k; a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, a_{k+3}, \\\\dots]. \\\\, \\\\end{align} A recursive relationship From the definition given above we can immediately deduce that : \\\\zeta_k = a_k + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta_{k+1}} = [a_k; \\\\zeta_{k+1}], \\\\, or, equivalently, : \\\\zeta_{k+1} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta_k - a_k}.\\\\, Complete quotients and the convergents of x Denoting the successive convergents of the regular continued fraction x = [a0; a1, a2, ‚Ä¶] by A0, A1/B1, A2/B2, ‚Ä¶ (as explained more fully in the article fundamental recurrence formulas), it can be shown that : x = \\\\frac{A_k \\\\zeta_{k+1} + A_{k-1}}{B_k \\\\zeta_{k+1} + B_{k-1}}\\\\, for all k ‚â• 0. This result can be better understood by recalling that the successive convergents of an infinite regular continued fraction approach the value x in a sort of zig-zag pattern: : A_0 < \\\\frac{A_2}{B_2} < \\\\frac{A_4}{B_4} < \\\\cdots < \\\\frac{A_{2n}}{B_{2n}} < x < \\\\frac{A_{2n+1}}{B_{2n+1}} < \\\\cdots < \\\\frac{A_5}{B_5} < \\\\frac{A_3}{B_3} < \\\\frac{A_1}{B_1}.\\\\, so that when k is even we have Ak/Bk < x < Ak+1/Bk+1, and when k is odd we have Ak+1/Bk+1 < x < Ak/Bk. In either case, the k + 1st complete quotient Œ∂ k+1 is the unique real number that expresses x in the form of a semiconvergent. Complete quotients and equivalent real numbers =An equivalence relation defined by LFTs= Consider the set of linear fractional transformations (LFTs) defined by : f(x) = \\\\frac{a + bx}{c + dx}\\\\, where a, b, c, and d are integers, and ad ‚àí bc = ¬±1. Since this set of LFTs contains an identity element (0 + x)/1, and since it is closed under composition of functions, and every member of the set has an inverse in the set, these LFTs form a group (the group operation being composition of functions), GL(2,Z). We can define an equivalence relation on the set of real numbers by means of this group of linear fractional transformations. We will say that two real numbers x and y are equivalent (written x ~ y) if : y = f(x) = \\\\frac{a + bx}{c + dx}\\\\, for some integers a, b, c, and d such that ad ‚àí bc = ¬±1. Clearly this relation is symmetric, reflexive, and transitive, so it is an equivalence relation and it can be used to separate the real numbers into equivalence classes. All the rational numbers are equivalent, because each rational number is equivalent to zero. What can be said about the irrational numbers? Do they also fall into a single equivalence class? =A theorem about \\"equivalent\\" irrational numbers= Two irrational numbers x and y are equivalent under this scheme if and only if the infinitely long \\"tails\\" in their expansions as regular continued fractions are exactly the same. More precisely, the following theorem can be proved. Let x and y be two irrational (real) numbers, and let the kth complete quotient in the regular continued fraction expansions of x and y be denoted by Œ∂ k and œà k, respectively, Then x ~ y (under the equivalence defined in the preceding section) if and only if there are positive integers m and n such that Œ∂ m = œà n. =An example= The golden ratio œÜ is the irrational number with the very simplest possible expansion as a regular continued fraction: œÜ = [1; 1, 1, 1, ‚Ä¶]. The theorem tells us first that if x is any real number whose expansion as a regular continued fraction contains the infinite string [1, 1, 1, 1, ‚Ä¶], then there are integers a, b, c, and d (with ad ‚àí bc = ¬±1) such that : x = \\\\frac{a + b\\\\phi}{c + d\\\\phi}.\\\\, Conversely, if a, b, c, and d are integers (with ad ‚àí bc = ¬±1), then the regular continued fraction expansion of every real number y that can be expressed in the form : y = \\\\frac{a + b\\\\phi}{c + d\\\\phi}\\\\, eventually reaches a \\"tail\\" that looks just like the regular continued fraction for œÜ.

It is more properly known as Rocky Mountain quartzite or Idaho quartzite, a metamorphic rock. The stone is quarried south of the city of Oakley in Cassia County, northeast of the three-state border with Nevada & Utah. The quarries are located on the west slope of Middle Mountain in the Albion Mountains, northwest of the City of Rocks National Reserve. Oakley stone is micaceous, meaning it is a mica- bearing stone. This mineral gives the product a fish-scale-like sheen. The stone is noted for its great variety of colors, ranging from white and silver to browns, yellows, and golds. Another stone in the area, Elba Quartzite, is a green micaceous quartzite. The green color of the rock is the result of chromium in the mica which is also known as fuchsite. The original sedimentary rock from which the quartzite formed was a quartz-rich sandstone. During the metamorphic process, the pressure caused the layers of clay within the sandstone to thin and flatten into the mica-rich layers. The space between planes of parting or foliation are consistent which makes it uniform in thickness. The outcroppings of the stone usually lie parallel to the ground and occur in large plates that can be easily split into thin veneers. Beginning in 1948, the stone was mined and sold in large quantities throughout the United States. It used for interior decoration, fireplace mantels, decks and patios, or facing buildings. A variant is \\"builders\\" which are naturally occurring brick-shaped pieces used to face building exteriors, building property walls, or fireplaces. There are about a dozen companies in the Oakley area quarrying the stone. Archie Boyd Teater's Studio designed by Frank Lloyd Wright used the stone in both the exterior and interior of the building. Geography The staging area for quarried Oakley stone is located at (42.139, -113.89), at an elevation of above sea level. The quarries are to the east and the summit of Middle Mountain is to the southeast at over .

Abraham Ozjasz Thon (also Yehoshua Thon) 13 February 1870 in Lviv ‚Äì 11 November 1936 in Krak√≥w) was a rabbi, early Zionist, and leader of the Jewish community in Poland. Biography Thon studied philosophy and sociology under George Simmel. As a student, he assisted Theodor Herzl in the ideological preparations for the First Zionist Congress. Thon died on 11 November 1936 and is buried in Krakow's New Jewish Cemetery. Rabbinic career In 1897, Ozjasz Thon was appointed to the rabbinate of Krakow, a position he held until his death. He was the rabbi of the Tempel Synagogue of the more religiously-liberal constituency within the Jewish community. He promoted a Zionist program despite the overall assimilationist trends prevalent in the Jewish community at that time, and was an adherent of Ahad Ha'Am's school of Jewish identity. Literary career In 1897 published a groundbreaking philosophical study of Zionism, Zur geschichtsphilosophischen Begrendung des Zionismus. Thon wrote literary and scientific academic works and journalistic essays, and a 1910 work on the philosophical and sociological methods of Herbert Spencer. Political career In 1906, Thon made an unsuccessful bid to represent the Jewish National Party in Kolomyya, Eastern Galicia, in the elections to the Austrian parliament. He continued his political activities and expanded them after the First World War. He represented the Western Galician Jewish National Council at the Versailles Peace Conference. In 1919, Thon was elected to the first Sejm and served in the Polish parliament until 1931, where his oratory received a hearing even among antisemitic MPs.

Plot Lee Yi Min stars as a young boy, Ah Pao, who wants to learn kung fu so that he can avenge his father's death at the hands of the Ghost Faced Killer (Mark Long). The Ghost Faced Killer meanwhile is hunting down a number of clan leaders who all conspired to have him killed. Before attacking, the killer always throws down his \\"ghost face killing plate,\\" a decorated metal plate with a red face. He then uses his distinctive five elements style. Ah Pao attends a local kung fu school (The Chang Sing School), but is bullied by the seniors. However, the school's cook (Yuen Siu Tien) helps the boy and teaches him some moves after challenging Ah Pao to steal one grain of rice from the Chef's bowl. He succeeds only in cheating and waiting for the Master to finish his meal. The chef then teaches Ah Pao some kung fu but admits that he will never be good enough. He tells him, \\"When the time comes to go, I'll tell you where to go all right.\\" He proves to be adequate for his day-to-day living but cannot fulfill his deep desire for revenge. When Ah Pao is found in possession of the Ghost Faced Killer's symbol, he is expelled from school. While he leaves in exile, his teacher is forced to shut the school down in fear of his students being killed. After the students leave, the Teacher is killed by the Ghost Face Killer. Still wishing to learn kung fu, he turns to an old Xiangqi (a.k.a. Chinese chess) master Chi Sue Tin (Jack Long), recommended by the cook, for training. The master is an old enemy of the Ghost Faced Killer who reveals his former identity: he was a former kung fu chief who held sway over the area with his fellow fighters, but he was forced to go into hiding after being badly injured in a fight and also coming under scrutiny by the Ghost Faced Killer. Chi Sue agrees to teach Lee his chess boxing kung fu. Ah Pao finally learns the strategic link between chess and kung fu. He and Chi Sue Tin team up using double horse style, a reference to Xiangqi, and they defeat the Ghost Faced Killer.

After retiring as a player, he went into coaching, and is currently goalkeeping coach at Bradford City. Playing career A goalkeeper, Vaughan came up through the youth ranks at West Ham United although he didn't make a first team appearance at Upton Park. Whilst at West Ham he was sent out on loan to gain experience at Charlton Athletic, Bristol Rovers, Wrexham and Bristol City before Fulham paid ¬£12,500 for his permanent services in the summer of 1986. Vaughan spent 2 seasons at Craven Cottage, making 44 league appearances. He was also in goal the night that Liverpool beat Fulham 10‚Äì0 in a Football League Cup game. He was released from Fulham in 1988 and was signed by Cambridge United manager Chris Turner. Vaughan went on to enjoy success at United as, led by Turner's successor John Beck, they gained successive promotions from 1989‚Äì91 to take them to the old Second Division. They finished the 1991‚Äì92 season in the play- offs for the inaugural Premier League season but were beaten by Leicester City. During the following season Vaughan fell out of favour once Beck had been sacked and subsequent United managers Ian Atkins and Gary Johnson preferred either Jon Sheffield or John Filan much of the time. At the end of the 1992/93 season Vaughan was released and joined Charlton Athletic where he made 6 appearances as back-up goalkeeper to Bob Bolder. When John Beck had taken over as manager of Preston North End he took Vaughan with him and he made 66 appearances at Deepdale. Beck was sacked and took over at Lincoln City, taking Vaughan with him again where he played a further 65 games. He wound down his league career with loan spells at Colchester United and Chesterfield before moving into coaching.A previous version of this profile listed Vaughan as playing non-league football in the Western League with the likes of Torrington and Barnstaple. This goalkeeper would seem to be a different John Vaughan with the appearances being made from 2004 onwards. Coaching career Vaughan went into coaching with clubs such as York City (appointed on a part-time basis in September 2003), Maccesfield Town and Grimsby Town. After doing some part-time coaching in the academy, Vaughan was appointed as goalkeeping coach at Huddersfield Town in August 2006. He was goalkeeping coach of Birmingham City from July 2012 to October 2014. In June 2015, he was appointed goalkeeping coach at Barnsley. In June 2019 he took up the role of goalkeeping coach at Bradford City. The next month he was praised by Bradford City manager Gary Bowyer.

Life  Janez Jalen was born into a rural family in the Upper Carniolan village of Rodine. His father awakened in him a great interest in nature early on in his life. After finishing secondary school in Kranj he studied theology in Ljubljana. His first pastoral appointment was to Srednja vas near Bohinj. The beauty of the surrounding area, which he came to love and admire, was what encouraged him to begin writing. During the First World War he was mobilised into the Austrian Army and served as a curate in the Lebring Army Camp near Graz. After the war he served as a priest in a number of places around Slovenia: ƒårnomelj, Stara Loka, Trnovo, Notranje Gorice and Ljubljana where he took early retirement in 1933. After the Second World War he re- entered service and was priest in Grahovo and finally Ljubno where he died. He is buried in Rodine.  Work  In his early period Jalen dedicated most of his time to writing plays depicting rural life at the time of the First World War. Among these are Dom (Home, 1923), Srenja (The Common, 1924), and Bratje (Brothers, 1931). Later he began writing prose, in which he also deals with rural life, albeit in a slightly idyllic way. His first novel, Ovƒçar Marko (Shepherd Marko), was originally published in installments in the magazine Mladika in 1928, the book only being published a year later. In 1958, it was re-published as the first part of Vozarji, an intended quartet about rural life. Jalen died before publishing any further volumes. His best-known work is a tale of a prehistoric people living on the marshes south of Ljubljana, titled Bobri (Beavers) which was published in three parts (Sam, Rod, Vrh; 1942‚Äì43).

Similar to a fragipan, Petrocalcic Horizon and petrogypsic horizon, it is firmly cemented and restricts soil management. In soil descriptions, they are most often denoted by the symbol Bqm. The closest equivalent in the Canadian system of soil classification is called a duric horizon, although it does not mean exactly the same thing as a duripan in the United States. They form almost exclusively in arid or Mediterranean climates, and can be as hard as concrete, which makes plowing very difficult or impossible. Soils that include duripans are generally used for grazing or wildlife habitat, and are seldom cultivated. Characteristics The required characteristics for a duripan, according to the \\"Keys to USDA soil taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\\" are: # The pan is cemented or indurated in more than 50 percent of the volume of some horizon; and # The pan shows evidence of accumulation of opal or other forms of silica, such as laminar caps, coatings, lenses, partly filled interstices, bridges between sand-sized grains, or coatings on rock or pararock fragments; and # Less than fifty percent of the volume of air-dry fragments slakes in 1 N HCl even during prolonged soaking, but more than 50 percent slakes in concentrated KOH or NaOH or in alternating acid and alkali; and # Because of lateral continuity, roots can penetrate the pan only along vertical fractures with a horizontal spacing of 10 cm or more. What this means in plain English is: # More than half the horizon is made up of cemented materials. # There is evidence that the horizon was actually formed by movement of silica into the subsoil. # The purpose of the water, HCl, and KOH tests is to separate a duripan from a Petrocalcic Horizon or fragipan. These tests are seldom conducted in a field environment and usually are performed in a lab with prepared field samples. # The main purpose of describing a duripan is to denote limitations for land management. If plant roots are able to penetrate the duripan then there is no significant limitation and there would be little point in describing a duripan. Genesis Duripans occur mostly in arid or semiarid climates, where the soil is usually dry or seasonally dry. Soils with duripans are often geographically associated with areas of volcanic activity, and show evidence of ash or volcanic glass deposition. Volcanic glass weathers rapidly, providing an ample supply of soluble silica to cement the underlying soil. Other common sources of the silica cementing agent are iron-magnesium minerals and feldspars. The parent material of duripan soils usually does not contain a large amount of calcium carbonate, and if there is an abundance of calcium, a Petrocalcic Horizon can form in conjunction with the duripan. The weathered silica is mostly transported by water into the subsoil, where it precipitates and forms microaggregates that gradually grow into a full-fledged duripan. It cannot be considered a duripan until the cracks and gaps that allow roots to penetrate are 10 cm or more apart. A duripan can sometimes be broken up by earthquakes or periods of alternate wetting and drying that cause small volume changes.

Addiscombe railway station was a terminus to the east of central Croydon, on Lower Addiscombe Road between Hastings Road and Grant Road. The East India Way housing development stands on the site. History A postcard of the station building before 1906 Opened by the Mid-Kent Railway, it was part of the South Eastern Railway, which became part of the Southern Railway at the Grouping of 1923. Addiscombe station was built with three platforms with extensive canopies, a fairly large station building and concourse, but the station was slowly run down after the Second World War. After nationalisation in 1948 the line became part of the Southern Region of British Railways. In 1956 platform 3 was closed and removed, and the goods yard closed in 1968. Through trains to London were withdrawn and the service reduced to a shuttle service to and from Elmers End. In 1993 the carriage depot was closed and around the same time the station became unstaffed with a PERTIS ticket machine outside the entrance. When sectorisation was introduced, the station was part of Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Rail, which Connex South Eastern took over. During its last years it received the station code \\"ACM\\" and was in travelcard zone 5. When the signal box was burnt down in 1996, the line was reduced to a single track operation and only platform 2 was used. The last train (an enthusiasts' railtour) was on the evening of Saturday 31 May 1997, which also visited the West Croydon‚ÄìWimbledon line, also closed that day. The station was closed in preparation for the construction of Tramlink, opening in 2000 along the former line from Elmers End to Woodside, then following the line towards Sanderstead, which had closed in 1983. Addiscombe tram stop is half a mile to the east. The station was demolished in 2001 and the site was used for the East India Way housing development ‚Äì named after the East India Company Military Seminary which was located nearby. All that survives are sections of the walls formerly supporting the canopy and station buildings. Part of the line beyond has become Addiscombe Railway Park. There had been a bid for the station to house a working railway museum, which Croydon Council opposed.

The prototype of such a structure is the field of complex numbers itself, considered as a complex vector space over itself and with the conjugation map \\\\sigma: {\\\\mathbb C} \\\\to {\\\\mathbb C}\\\\,, with \\\\sigma (z)={\\\\bar z}, giving the \\"canonical\\" real structure on {\\\\mathbb C}\\\\,, that is {\\\\mathbb C}={\\\\mathbb R}\\\\oplus i{\\\\mathbb R}\\\\,. The conjugation map is antilinear: \\\\sigma (\\\\lambda z)={\\\\bar \\\\lambda}\\\\sigma(z)\\\\, and \\\\sigma (z_1+z_2)=\\\\sigma(z_1)+\\\\sigma(z_2)\\\\,. Vector space A real structure on a complex vector space V is an antilinear involution \\\\sigma: V \\\\to V. A real structure defines a real subspace V_{\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\subset V, its fixed locus, and the natural map : V_{\\\\mathbb R} \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{R}} {\\\\mathbb C} \\\\to V is an isomorphism. Conversely any vector space that is the complexification of a real vector space has a natural real structure. One first notes that every complex space V has a realification obtained by taking the same vectors as in the original set and restricting the scalars to be real. If t\\\\in V\\\\, and t eq 0 then the vectors t\\\\, and it\\\\, are linearly independent in the realification of V. Hence: : \\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb R}V = 2\\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb C}V Naturally, one would wish to represent V as the direct sum of two real vector spaces, the \\"real and imaginary parts of V\\". There is no canonical way of doing this: such a splitting is an additional real structure in V. It may be introduced as follows.Budinich, P. and Trautman, A. The Spinorial Chessboard. Springer- Verlag, 1988, p. 29. Let \\\\sigma: V \\\\to V\\\\, be an antilinear map such that \\\\sigma\\\\circ\\\\sigma=id_{V}\\\\,, that is an antilinear involution of the complex space V. Any vector v\\\\in V\\\\, can be written {v = v^{+} + v^{-}}\\\\,, where v^+ ={1\\\\over {2}}(v+\\\\sigma v) and v^- ={1\\\\over {2}}(v-\\\\sigma v)\\\\,. Therefore, one gets a direct sum of vector spaces V=V^{+}\\\\oplus V^{-}\\\\, where: :V^{+}=\\\\\\\\{v\\\\in V  \\\\sigma v = v\\\\\\\\} and V^{-}=\\\\\\\\{v\\\\in V  \\\\sigma v = -v\\\\\\\\}\\\\,. Both sets V^+\\\\, and V^-\\\\, are real vector spaces. The linear map K: V^+ \\\\to V^-\\\\,, where K(t)=it\\\\,, is an isomorphism of real vector spaces, whence: : \\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb R}V^+ = \\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb R}V^- = \\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb C}V\\\\,. The first factor V^+\\\\, is also denoted by V_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\, and is left invariant by \\\\sigma\\\\,, that is \\\\sigma(V_{\\\\mathbb{R}})\\\\subset V_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\,. The second factor V^-\\\\, is usually denoted by iV_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\,. The direct sum V=V^{+}\\\\oplus V^{-}\\\\, reads now as: :V=V_{\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\oplus iV_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\,, i.e. as the direct sum of the \\"real\\" V_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\, and \\"imaginary\\" iV_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\, parts of V. This construction strongly depends on the choice of an antilinear involution of the complex vector space V. The complexification of the real vector space V_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\,, i.e., V^{\\\\mathbb{C}}= V_{\\\\mathbb R} \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\, admits a natural real structure and hence is canonically isomorphic to the direct sum of two copies of V_{\\\\mathbb R}\\\\,: :V_{\\\\mathbb R} \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\mathbb{C}= V_{\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\oplus iV_{\\\\mathbb{R}}\\\\,. It follows a natural linear isomorphism V_{\\\\mathbb R} \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb{R}} \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to V\\\\, between complex vector spaces with a given real structure. A real structure on a complex vector space V, that is an antilinear involution \\\\sigma: V \\\\to V\\\\,, may be equivalently described in terms of the linear map \\\\hat \\\\sigma:V\\\\to\\\\bar V\\\\, from the vector space V\\\\, to the complex conjugate vector space \\\\bar V\\\\, defined by :v \\\\mapsto \\\\hat\\\\sigma (v):=\\\\overline{\\\\sigma(v)}\\\\,.Budinich, P. and Trautman, A. The Spinorial Chessboard. Springer-Verlag, 1988, p. 29. Algebraic variety For an algebraic variety defined over a subfield of the real numbers, the real structure is the complex conjugation acting on the points of the variety in complex projective or affine space. Its fixed locus is the space of real points of the variety (which may be empty). Scheme For a scheme defined over a subfield of the real numbers, complex conjugation is in a natural way a member of the Galois group of the algebraic closure of the basefield. The real structure is the Galois action of this conjugation on the extension of the scheme over the algebraic closure of the base field. The real points are the points whose residue field is fixed (which may be empty).

In his youth he was also an outstanding cricketer. Cricket Archive profile Life Robert Malcolm Gwynn (generally known to family and friends as ‚ÄúRobin‚Äù or ‚ÄúR.M.‚Äù) was born in Ramelton, County Donegal, on 26 April 1877 while his father, the Reverend John Gwynn, was Dean of Raphoe. He was one of eight brothers and two sisters. Their mother was Lucy Josephine Gwynn, daughter of the Irish patriot William Smith O'Brien.Canon Patrick Comerford, R.M. Gwynn Memorial Lecture at the R.M. Gwynn Seminar, Rathfarnham, 19 September 2013. Robin Gwynn was educated at St Columba's College, Rathfarnham and Dublin University. In 1896 he headed the list of Foundation Scholars in Classics at Trinity College, Dublin. In 1898 he graduated Bachelor of Arts, gaining a \\"first of firsts\\" with gold medals in Classics and Modern Literature.Dictionary of Ulster Biography, Robert Malcolm Gwynn (1877-1962). In 1900, along with his brother Edward Gwynn and others, Robin Gwynn founded the Social Services (Tenements) Company to provide housing for poor families in Dublin city. He subsequently spent many periods working with the poor in Dublin‚Äôs slums. He was instrumental in founding the Trinity Mission, which served slum dwellers in Belfast, and was for many years actively involved in the Dublin University Fukien Mission (later the Dublin University Far Eastern Mission), eventually becoming its chairman and president. Robin Gwynn was ordained deacon in 1906, achieving full priesthood two years later.Crockford‚Äôs Clerical Directory, 1961/1962 edition, pp 485-486. He was the only one of Rev John Gwynn's sons to be ordained, and he never served in a parish. That same year, 1906, he proceeded to MA and was elected a Fellow of Trinity College Dublin. In 1907 he was appointed Lecturer in Divinity and Tutor. He would remain Lecturer in Divinity until 1919 and continue as Tutor until 1937. He was appointed Chaplain of TCD in 1911, retaining that post until 1919. In January 1909 Robin Gwynn was appointed Acting Warden of his old school, Saint Columba's College, which was facing a major financial crisis. He kept the institution afloat until a new Warden was appointed. Horrified by the brutality of the Dublin Metropolitan Police towards strikers during the lockout in 1913, Robin Gwynn became a prominent advocate of the workers' cause and joined the Industrial Peace Committee. On 12 November 1913, when the committee was barred from holding its meeting at the Mansion House, R.M. invited the members to his college rooms at No 40, New Square. It was this meeting that led to the foundation of the Irish Citizen Army. In their history of Trinity College McDowell and Webb observe: \\"Gwynn's support for the 'army' concept was based simply on the idea that military- style discipline would keep unemployed men fit and give them self-respect. ‚Äô‚ÄôSancta simplicitas!‚Äô‚Äô\\"Kevin Morley, A Descriptive History Of The Irish Citizen Army, Dublin: Original Writing, 2012. In 1914 Robin Gwynn married Dr Eileen Gertrude Glenn, a rector's daughter from Pomeroy, County Tyrone. They were to have six children. In 1916 Robin Gwynn was appointed Professor of Biblical Greek, a post he held for forty years (1916-1956). During those four decades he held a number of other, often overlapping, academic appointments at the university, including Professor of Hebrew (1920-1937), Registrar (1941), Vice-Provost (1941-1943), Senior Lecturer (1944-1950), and Senior Tutor (1950-1956). In 1937 he was co-opted to Senior Fellowship. When the Dublin University Fabian Society was formed R.M. Gwynn became one of its vice- presidents. Like several of his brothers Robin Gwynn was a fine cricket player, in his youth captaining both his school XI and the Dublin University XI. He retained a lifelong interest in the sport, and J V Luce portrays him as President of the Dublin University Cricket Club, with his \\"tall rangy figure ... a familiar sight at matches in College Park.\\"J V Luce, In Retrospect: Robert Malcolm Gwynn Search XX/2, Winter 1997, pp 121-125. Robin Gwynn was tall and athletic, but in later life suffered from deafness. To aid his hearing he used to carry a large ear trumpet with him and this, together with his height and glowing white hair, made him an impressive and instantly recognizable figure round Trinity College. In character he was patient, kind and wise, but at the same time resolute and tough. His nephew-in-law, the late Archbishop George Simms, remarked that his \\"gentle humility inspired trust and drew confidences, his stubborn integrity brought surprises for those who mistook charity for easy-going indifference,\\" and spoke of his \\"athanasian courage.\\"George Otto Simms, Robert Malcolm Gwynn Trinity: an annual record, No 14, Trinity College Dublin, Michaelmas 1962. Robin Gwynn died in Dublin in June 1962, aged 85, and was buried in Whitechurch churchyard. Cricketing career A right-handed batsman and right-arm slow bowler, Robin Gwynn played once for the Ireland cricket team in 1901.CricketEurope Stats Zone profile He also played four first-class matches for Dublin University in 1895.First-class matches played by Robert Gwynn at Cricket Archive Gwynn made his first-class debut for Dublin University against the MCC on 20 May 1895. Three days later he played for the MCC against Ireland.Scorecard of Ireland v MCC match in Dublin in May 1895 He played three further first-class matches for Dublin University in that year, two against Cambridge University and one against Leicestershire. Six years later, he played his only match for Ireland, a two- day match against South Africa in June 1901. Gwynn once enjoyed the distinction of bowling W. G. Grace for a first ball duck.Wisden Cricketer's Almanack, 1964 Obituaries Several of Robin Gwynn's close kin were also noted cricketers. His brother John played first-class cricket in India, whilst two further brothers (Lucius and Arthur) also represented Ireland, as did his cousin Donough O'Brien. His nephew John David Gwynn also played for Dublin University.

It was filmed in Mandarin, as opposed to Cantonese which is more common due to Hong Kong's enormous output on the genre. Plot Sang Kuan Chun is an old kung fu master who is getting ready to retire from martial arts. But just as he is about to put up the kings signboard and call it quits, he receives a note alleging that he's not the best. Thus begins his journey for one last challenge with each of the Seven Grandmasters to prove his superiority. As Sang Kuan Chun and his three students travel from one challenge to the next, the foursome acquires a fifth‚Äîa young man named Siu Ying who wants desperately to train under master Sang Kuan Chun to avenge his father's death. So he tags along, despite the master's insistence that he will not accept any more students. Eventually we learn more about the master's past. His own teacher, before he died, left him the secret book of The Pai Mei Twelve Strikes. However a masked man soon stole several pages of the book, leaving only nine strikes. So, somewhere out there, is this unknown man, and he has the final three strikes of Pai Mei, which are the most deadly and can beat even the other nine strikes. Sang Kuan Chun soon accepts the seemingly devout Siu Ying and teaches him the nine known strikes of Pai Mei. Siu Ying ends up learning from his ‚Äúuncle‚Äù that Sang Kuan Chun (who was set up) killed his father during a friendly tournament. Siu Ying is taught the final 3 strikes from a mysterious figure and almost kills Sang Kuan Chun until he being a loyal good student couldn't break his teacher's rule of \\"Never kill anyone if it can be avoided\\". This all leads up to an exciting climax, where we learn the identity of the masked man who stole the Pai Mei final strikes and the identity of the man who killed Siu Ying's father.

It first appeared as a five-part serial in All-Story Weekly from May 1 to 29, 1915. It was first published in book form in hardcover by A. C. McClurg in September, 1923. A map by Burroughs of the Empire of Pellucidar accompanied both the magazine and book versions. Plot summary David Innes and his captive, a member of the reptilian Mahar master race of the interior world of Pellucidar, return from the surface world in the Iron Mole invented by his friend and companion in adventure Abner Perry. Emerging in Pellucidar at an unknown location, David frees his captive. He names the place Greenwich and uses the technology he has brought to begin the systematic exploration and mapping of the unknown land while searching for his lost companions, Abner, Ghak, and Dian the Beautiful. He soon encounters and befriends a new ally, Ja the Mezop of the island country of Anoroc; later he finds Abner, from whom he learns that in his absence the human revolt against the Mahars has not been going well. a later printing of Pellucidar In a parlay with the Mahars David bargains for information of his love Dian and his enemy Hooja the Sly One, which his foes agree to supply in return for the book containing the Great Secret of Mahar reproduction that David stole and hid in the previous novel. David undertakes to recover it, only to find that Hooja has been there before him and claimed Dian as his own reward of the Mahars! Now he has to track down and defeat the sly one before resuming the human war of independence. Ultimately this is accomplished, and with the aid of the resources David has brought from the surface world he and Abner succeed in building a confederacy of human tribes into an \\"Empire of Pellucidar\\" that wipes out the Mahar cities and establishes a new human civilization in their place. Reception Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale, discussing the 1962 reprint, noted that the novel's \\"scientific\\" background was \\"hard swallowing\\" but praised the novel, saying \\"once Burroughs establishes his background, his reader has no time to quibble\\". Adaptation DC Comics began an adaptation of the novel in Weird Worlds #6, mixing it with the ending of At the Earth's Core. It ended in #7.

Egg white albumen is composed of multiple proteins, of which ovotransferrin is the most heat reliable. It has a molecular weight of 76,000 daltons and contains about 700 amino acids. Ovotransferrin makes up approximately 13% of egg albumen (in contrast to ovalbumin, which comprises 54%). As a member of the transferrin and metalloproteinase family, ovotransferrin has been found to produce heat shock proteins. When these heat shock proteins are induced in the skin, they provide protection against cold stress and other environmental stresses. Structure Ovotransferrin is folded in a way that forms two lobes (N- and C- terminals) and each lobe consists of a binding site. Each lobe is then divided into two domains of 160 amino acid residues. Its structure also consists of fifteen disulfide crosslinks and no free sulfhydryl groups. Disulfide groups stabilize the tertiary structures of proteins. Transferrins are iron binding proteins and acute phase reactants of animal serum. It has a binding log of 15 at a pH of 7 or above, meaning that the iron binding capacity of ovotransferrin rapidly decreased at a pH that is less than 6. This family is also known for their role in cell maturation by transporting essential nutrients to developing embryos. Ovotransferrin functions as an antimicrobial agent and transports iron to the developing embryo. Because they bind to iron, this makes it difficult for harmful bacteria to be nutritionally satisfied with them so it acts as an antimicrobial. The primary sequence of ovotransferrin is similar to that of many serum transferrins found in other species. Recently, scientists have discovered a blood serum transferrin in humans, that binds iron like ovotransferrin and which shows 50% homology to ovotransferrin, i.e., they have similar amino acid composition and carbohydrate content. At the C- lobe, human serum has two N-glycans while the hen ovotransferrin has a single N-glycan. Consequently, structurally this protein differs from its serum counterpart because of its glycosylation pattern. These proteins are said to be glycosylated because they have carbohydrates attached to them. Glycosylation is the most common covalent modification (formation of chemical bonds) that occurs in living organisms. This process is determined by the structure of the protein backbone and the carbohydrate attachment site. In addition, ovotransferrin is glycosylated by the N-linkage to the amino acid known as asparagine, meaning that the glycan, the carbohydrate chain, is attached to the nitrogen on the amino acid. Asparagine, found abundantly in asparagus (hence, its name), is one of twenty of the most common amino acids and was the first amino acid to be isolated. While ovotransferrin identifies with its family, there are two types of ovotransferrin proteins: apo and holo. Apo-Ovotransferrin is deprived of iron and holo-Ovotransferrin is saturated with iron. Because the apo-ovotransferrin is iron-deprived, it is easily destroyed by physical and chemical treatments. Biologically, conalbumin isolates and sequesters metallic contaminants in the egg white.

The organization is funded by memberships, annual fund contributions, investments, grants, fund-raising projects and planned gifts. Over 700 members hail from Oberlin and elsewhere in Lorain County, as well as from across the country. Sites Its complex of historic sites includes the Monroe House (1866), Jewett House (1884) and Little Red Schoolhouse (1836‚Äì1837). Guided tours of the three sites are offered on a walk-in basis three days a week and at other times for groups by appointment. Main themes of the tour include life in the 1830s ‚Äì c. 1915 Oberlin, African American history, the Underground Railroad, women's history, scientific discovery, and missionary, temperance, and other reform movements. The brick Italianate-style Monroe House was originally the home of General Giles W. Shurtleff, leader of the first African-American regiment from Ohio to serve in the American Civil War. The house became the longtime home of James Monroe and his wife, Julia Finney Monroe. He was an important abolitionist, advocate of voting rights for African-Americans, and friend of Frederick Douglass. Monroe taught at Oberlin College, served as a U.S. Consul to Brazil, and was a five- term U.S. Congressman. Mrs. Monroe was a daughter of Charles Grandison Finney, the great religious leader of Oberlin College. The brick Victorian Jewett House was the home of Oberlin College chemistry professor Frank Fanning Jewett and his wife, Sarah Frances Gulick Jewett, author of numerous books on public health and hygiene, daughter of Luther Halsey Gulick Sr. and sister of Luther Halsey Gulick Jr.. The Jewetts and the subsequent owners, the Hubbards, rented rooms to male Oberlin College students, who slept in the attic and studied on the second floor. One of Jewett's students was Charles Martin Hall, who discovered the cost-effective process for commercially manufactured aluminum. The house and simple woodshed feature an exhibit called Aluminum: The Oberlin Connection, which includes a re-creation of Hall's 1886 woodshed experiment. The Little Red Schoolhouse was the first public school in town. Notably, in defiance of Ohio's \\"Black Laws\\", the school was interracial from its inception. Sarah Margru Kinson, who as a young girl was on board the infamous La Amistad, returned later to America and became one of the first African Americans to attend the school. Restored as a pioneer-era one-room school, the Little Red Schoolhouse offers visitors a hands-on look at life and education in the 1800s. History The roots of the Oberlin Heritage Center date back to the Oberlin Village Improvement Society, founded in 1903 by a group of concerned citizens to beautify and improve the town, and the Oberlin Historical society, organized in 1960 to preserve the Little Red Schoolhouse and the Monroe House. The two volunteer groups merged in 1964 as the Oberlin Historical and Improvement Organization (O.H.I.O.). The organization has grown since hiring two professional staff members in 1993, and in 2005 was renamed \\"The Oberlin Heritage Center\\". The Oberlin Heritage Center is now a small museum. In 2006 it was selected to be part of the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Partner Places program. The National Park Service designated the Oberlin Heritage Center as a facility on its National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom in 2004. The organization also prepared the nomination for the National Trust for Historic Preservation's selection of Oberlin as one of its 2004 Dozen Distinctive Destinations.

She first appeared in Birds of Prey #92 (May 2006). She was created by Gail Simone (writer) and Paulo Siqueira (artist). Sin appeared as a recurring character on The CW show Arrow, played by Bex Taylor-Klaus. Fictional character biography Sin was introduced when Black Canary made a deal with Lady Shiva. They would switch lives for a year, in which Dinah would train as Lady Shiva had done, while Shiva herself took her position with Oracle and the Birds of Prey. During Dinah's training, she arrived at a village in Asia, which was ruled by a martial arts master known simply as Mother. Dinah was allowed to be trained by the cruel matriarch, though it often came as horrible mental and physical abuse. While there, Dinah met a little girl dubbed Sin (the name may have been created to dehumanize Sin; while training there, Dinah was given the name \\"Tag\\", meaning \\"swine\\"). Sin was being groomed to become the next Lady Shiva, following the death of the current one. Sin and Dinah developed an immediate bond that bordered on sister and mother/daughter. When Dinah grew tired of Mother and her training, she decided to leave, and take Sin with her. Mother attempted to stop her, but was no match for Black Canary. Returning to Metropolis with Sin, Dinah introduced Sin to her friends in the Birds of Prey, who all took a shine to the girl. They began to teach her the wonders of the western world and educate her in English and name-calling (she on occasion addressed Helena as \\"Spinster\\"). Over time Dinah began to question her life as member of the Birds of Prey, now that she had a child to care for. After several missions, she decided to leave the team so as to raise Sin full- time. This would prove difficult after Dinah rejoined the Justice League. In the Black Canary miniseries, the League of Assassins attempts to kidnap Sin, seeing the martial arts prodigy as a messiah that could unite their splintered and then-leaderless group. In an attempt to save Sin from the League, Green Arrow fakes the child's death. Though the decision pains him, he conceals the truth from Dinah so that her grief will be real and convincing to their enemies. Dinah later learns of her foster daughter's survival. Sin lives in a secluded monastery, to keep her safe from the League of Assassins and others who would exploit her intuitive gift for the martial arts. Black Canary makes occasional trips to visit her, still playing the role of mother part-time. In other media =Television= Sin appears in season 2 of Arrow portrayed by Bex Taylor-Klaus.Arrow Scoop: Breakout Killing Co-Star Commits to ‚ÄòSin‚Äô-ful Season 2 Arc In this reinterpretation of the character, she is a streetwise Caucasian teenager instead of Chinese from the Glades, a slum in Starling City, who is a confidante and sidekick of Sara Lance, the Canary (Caity Lotz). This version of the character is named Cindy, but is referred to as Sin for short. Debuting in \\"Broken Dolls\\", Sara apparently saved her from some men attacking her and that is how the two became friends. After Arrow asks Roy Harper to find the Canary, Roy uses a contact to lead him to Sin. After a chase Roy eventually finds the Canary, but is captured by her and Sin, whom they thought was sent by the League of Assassins but is later released after the Canary discovers that Roy is connected to the Queen family, and thus the vigilante realizes that Roy was sent by the Arrow. Sin is later shot at a Cash for Guns event by \\"The Mayor\\" in \\"Crucible\\" and Roy comes to her aid. The two remain friends and she comes to him for help in finding a friend who, it turns out, was murdered by Brother Blood in \\"The Scientist\\". Sin briefly appears in \\"Three Ghosts\\" in Thea's room after Roy was saved by Arrow from Blood. She later appears in \\"Blind Spot\\" and is the first person outside of Team Arrow to know Roy's new superstrength. She agrees to help him use it to protect the city and baits the \\"Starling Slasher\\" so that Roy can take him down. In the process Roy nearly kills him and when she tries to intervene he pushes her down. He immediately snaps out of it and at the hospital she comments on how they nearly killed him and how Roy lost control. In \\"Time of Death\\" she reunites with Sara after she returns and considers Sara to be her big sister. Sara has a flashback to the island and recalls when she, Oliver, and Slade Wilson witnessed a plane being shot down by Dr. Ivo. As the guys rush to get medical supplies, Sara stays with the pilot and he reveals himself to be Sin's father, and he asks Sara to watch over her, though the daughter being Sin isn't revealed until the present when Sara is looking at the picture that Sin's father gave her. Sara didn't reveal to Sin of the past connection with her father and his death, leaving her to believe that her father abandoned her. In \\"Seeing Red\\", Sin again encounters Roy completely under the influence of Mirakuru. She attempted to stop several people from attacking Roy, as they misinterpreted the situation. Roy then pushes Sin to the ground and later talks to Sara about his problematic behaviour. Befora Sara leaves Star City, she and Sin shared a hug. Sin returns in the season three episode \\"Uprising\\" where she, Black Canary, Arsenal, Wildcat and John Diggle face off against Danny Brickwell and his men. During that time she notices that Black Canary is not Sara (who is killed by Malcolm Merlyn in \\"The Calm\\") and informs about this to her father Quentin Lance.

The original Mandarin version was released onto VHS format in the 1980s and is now out of print. A rare Japanese language dubbed version („Éâ„É©„Ç¥„É≥Â§™Ê•µÊã≥) can be found online. There is a Spanish (Spain) language dubbed version available too.  Plot  The film opens with a montage of a youth learning the techniques of T'ai chi. A narration explains the rigors of T'ai chi, and the effects it has on the individuals who learn it. When a person masters T'ai chi, their body becomes impregnable to any weapon, but has a side effect of turning the person's hair white by age thirty and their voices attain a high tone. Students of the Lei Ping Kung Fu school witness two thugs from the Chin Yin Chi clan chase an beating an old man in front of his daughter. The lead student, Ming Tu, interrupts the attack and the thugs use weapons on the students. Ming Tu manages to fight off the duo, but one of his fellow students is mortally wounded. The two thugs warn the students that the Chin Yin Chi clan will be back to kill them. Ming Tu escorts the old man and his daughter back to the Lei Ping school, where the wise master takes them under his protection. The two leaders of the Chin Yin Chi clan, Chief Chin and Chin Pa, show up at the Lei Ping school, demanding that the master hand over the old man. He refuses and one of his top pupils offers to go and fight for the schools honor. Despite his magnificent martial arts ability, he is no match. The master selects Ming Tu as his successor and faces the aggressors, but he is overpowered and killed. The old man, having taken an oath of peace, picks up a sword for the first time in twenty years and leaps into battle, but he too is taken down by the powerful duo. Ming Tu assumes leadership of the school and promises his students that the school will continue as the master intended and they will take revenge against the Chin Yin Chi clan. Ming Tu comes up with a plan to take Chin Pa out of the equation, since he is not invulnerable. He challenges Chin Pa to a duel, but he falls victim to Chin Pa's loaded steel baton with a blade, but he escapes. Ming Tu undergoes rigorous training to prepare for the next confrontation. He thinks up a way to counter Chin Pa's baton‚Äîby covering his sword in oil so his opponent cannot get a grip on it, which works, and Ming Tu kills Chin Pa. Chief Chin discovers the death and looks for Ming Tu. Ming seeks additional training before he can face Chief Chin, but is forced into a confrontation with him. Chief Chin beats Ming unmercifully. The next senior pupil of the Wei Ping school, Sa Chien takes charge since Ming Tu is out of action. He trains hard to beat Chief Chin, but Sa Chien cannot get the job done and barely escapes. The master's daughter meets an old nun who tells her how to find Chief Chin's weak point \\"when he is not himself.\\" With her aid, Sa Chien discovers that Chief Chin has one vulnerable spot, but getting him to expose it is near impossible unless he can get him to act other than \\"himself.\\" Cast *Carter Wong as Tieh Wu Ching *Jack Long as Ming Tu *Mark Long as Sa Chien *Lo Lieh as Ku Yu Tieh *Nancy Yen as Ying Ying *Wong Fei-lung as Lu Ping *Alan Chui Chung-San as Pa Chu *Corey Yuen as Hei Pai Killer *Yuen Shun-yi as Hei Pai Killer *Su Chen Ping as Liu Chin  External links  * Born Invincible at Hong Kong Cinemagic  \\"Born Invincible (Japanese) „Éâ„É©„Ç¥„É≥Â§™Ê•µÊã≥\\" at AmebaVision (Japanese)  References  Category:1978 films Category:Taiwanese films Category:Kung fu films Category:Films directed by Joseph Kuo ","title":"Born Invincible"},{"id":"10776054","text":"1922 by Bassano Ltd James Farquharson Remnant, 1st Baron Remnant, (13 February 1862 ‚Äì 30 January 1933), known as Sir James Remnant, 1st Baronet, from 1917 to 1928, was a British Conservative politician.

Band members * Rick Witter (Vocals) * Rob Wilson (Guitars) * Stuart Fletcher (Bass Guitar) * Matt Lunn (Drums) History In August 2005, former Shed Seven front man, Rick Witter, announced details of his new band, Rick Witter & The Dukes, along with a week of low key concerts in Scotland. The initial plan for The Dukes was to mix playing brand new material together with a few old Shed Seven songs in an effort not to alienate Witter's existing fanbase from the days with his former band. His new outfit maintained the guitar rock stylings of his predecessor, but added a harder, rockier edge. Two sold out shows at Fibbers, in York, followed the handful of Scottish dates in December of the same year. The same month also saw the first airing of Dukes material online, as four song excerpts began streaming on a newly created Rick Witter & the Dukes MySpace page (which was later to become the band's official website). The four short demos included the tracks; \\"He Was the Boy Who Waited So Long He Forgot What He Was Waiting For\\", \\"Pull Together\\", \\"The Devil Will Be Waiting For You\\" and \\"The Other Way Around\\". By April 2006, the Dukes had announced a full 18-date UK tour, as well as making a further demo available to download for free, titled \\"The Sky Falls Down\\". In July 2006, the band began recording sessions for their self-financed debut album in Leeds with record producer, Will Jackson, initially slated for release in late 2006. In August of the same year, the band went on to headline the Beached Festival in Scarborough, whilst their debut album The Year of the Rat was finally released in April 2007 via Hookline and Singer/Notting Hill Music. Five of the album's tracks feature fellow York musicians, Chris Helme and John Hargreaves of the Yards, on backing vocals and piano, whilst one track features the additional vocals of the Leeds-based jazz musician, Kate Peters. The LP itself is dedicated to the memory of Roger Witter, Rick's father. Initial copies of the album came in the form of a special limited edition, presented in an embossed metal tin with card slip case and fold out lyric poster, and limited to 1,000 units. To celebrate the album's release, the band announced a special one-off gig aboard a boat on York's River Ouse, known as the Ouse Cruise, as the band played a set consisting entirely of their own material to 70 fans.

Biography  Initially a supporter of the Swiss fascist movement of Arthur Fonjallaz, he came to wider attention in 1949 when he published Ubu Justicier au Premier Proc√®s de Nuremberg, one of the first works to question the veracity of the Holocaust.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 10 Increasingly active in neo-fascism, he organized conferences in Malm√∂ in 1951 which led to the formation of a pan- European nationalist group known as the European Social Movement and then led the more radical splinter group known as the New European Order later that year. This group sought the creation of a new Rome‚ÄìBerlin axis to unite Europe against capitalism and communism and in January 1953 set up a European Liaison Office under Amaudruz in Lausanne to co-ordinate the work of affiliated groups. He also became an early member of the Volkspartei der Schweiz but left the party over the issue of South Tyrol (where he was opposed to irredentism). Of all the groups involved Amaudruz was closest to Ordine Nuovo. Conferences were held irregularly, although membership was fluid and Amaudruz devoted much of his time to writing for journals such as Nation Europa. In 1983 he set up Nationale Koordination as an umbrella group for figures on the Swiss far right. Bringing together various shades of extremist opinion, the group began to fall out of favour in the mid 1990s as younger activists saw it as an \\"old men's club\\".AXT report on Switzerland In 2000 Amaudruz was sentenced to a year in a Swiss jail for Holocaust denial,'Holocaust Revisionist sentenced' from bbc.co.uk and returned to prison in 2003 on similar charges.

AMS generally results in abnormal ectoderm-derived structures. The most prominent abnormality is the underdevelopment (microblepharon) or absence of eyelids ‚Äì signifying the ablepharon aspect of the disease ‚Äì and a wide, fish-like mouth ‚Äì macrostomia. Infants presenting with AMS may also have malformations of the abdominal wall and nipples. Children with AMS might also experience issues with learning development, language difficulties and intellectual disabilities. AMS is caused by mutations in the TWIST2 gene, among others. It is closely related to Barber‚ÄìSay syndrome in terms of phenotypic abnormalities.  Signs and symptoms  AMS is generally characterized by abnormal appearances of the skin, eyes, fingers, genitals, head and face. Infants with AMS will have thin, redundantly wrinkled skin and excessive facial creases; wide-set eyes with absent or severely underdeveloped eyelids and down-turned lower eyelids; and a wide, fish-like mouth that may be fused together at the corners. Other appearances of the face and head include: broad nasal bridge, wide, flared nostrils and thick and flared alae nasi (edges of the nostrils). Abnormalities can also be seen in the hands and fingers, as infants with AMS will also have webbed fingers with limited ability to flex and extend the fingers. Infants with AMS will also display small, rudimentary ears that are atypically low-set on the skull. Absence of the zygomatic bone is also possible. Skin may be dry and coarse, excessively wrinkled around the face and loose around the hands yet tight around the finger joints, leading to diminished use of the fingers. Genital defects may include: ambiguous genitalia, a displaced and/or atypically small penis (micropenis), an absent scrotum around the testes and undescended testicles. Finally, alopecia and thin, sparse hair are also frequently observed.  Causes  Like Barber‚ÄìSay syndrome, AMS is caused by mutations in the TWIST2 gene that affect a highly conserved residue of TWIST2 (twist-related protein 2). TWIST2 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that binds to E-box DNA motifs (5'-CANNTG-3') as a heterodimer and inhibits transcriptional activation. Because TWIST2 mediates mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and prevents premature or ectopic osteoblast differentiation, mutations in TWIST2 that disrupt these functions by altering DNA-binding activity could explain many of the phenotypes of AMS. Current research points to the substitution of the wild-type amino acid for Lysine at TWIST2 residue 75 as a significant genetic cause of AMS. AMS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, in which an affected individual needs only one copy of the mutant allele in order to express the disease.  Mechanism  The mesenchyme is a mesodermal embryonic tissue that can develop into a multitude of different tissues depending on the needs of the developing embryo. The mesenchyme can develop into blood, cartilage, and membranes. In a normal patient, TWIST2 is highly expressed during embryonic development, specifically in the craniofacial development and chondrogenisis. TWIST2 works to prevent the premature maturation of chondrogenic cells and osteoblasts, the cells that will form cartilage and bone respectively. The dominant mutation in TWIST2 leads to the chondrogenic and osteoblastic cells becoming mature prematurely. This then leads to the primary craniofacial deformities seen in AMS patients.  Diagnosis  Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome can be diagnosed at birth by identification of characteristic physical findings, clinical evaluation, and specialized imaging techniques such as CT scans. CT scans can confirm the absence of the zygomatic arch and abnormalities in the cranial and mandibular bones. An ophthalmologist can diagnose abnormalities in the eyelids and confirm microblepharon or ablepharon. Teams of specialist will typically work together to confirm diagnosis and assess treatment options. Pediatricians, gastroenterologists, dermatologists, urologists, and other care providers can be expected to aid in the diagnosis and treatment.  Treatment  Primary treatment focuses on relief of immediate symptoms such as providing lubrication to the eyes to relieve pain and dryness; antibiotics may also be prescribed to prevent infections and inflammation. Surgical measures can be taken and a plastic surgeon can correct the lack of eyelids through reconstructive surgery. Surgery to correct malformations of the mouth, ears, genitals, fingers, and skin can also be performed as necessary. Macrostomia, the wide, fish-like mouth, can be corrected by a maxillofacial surgeon. The skin can be treated by means of creams to alleviate dryness and coarseness; in certain cases, botulinum toxin and skin grafts were used to improve the overall appearance. It is highly recommended that patients are able to seek the help of pediatric psychologists throughout the entire treatment process.  Prognosis  While there is no cure for AMS, treatment plans provided by doctors can help improve development, overall quality of life, and physical appearance. Physical appearance cannot be corrected to the \\"norm\\" but the life expectancy of patients diagnosed with AMS is normal.  Research  Current research into AMS focuses on both underlying causes of the disease and surgical methods for treatment. Currently, a study in Tokyo, Japan is focusing on the role of other TWIST genes in AMS development, specifically the role of TWIST1 and the amino acid substitution that must occur to mutate the gene. TWIST1 mutations are believed to lead to craniosynostosis and ablepharon. Clinical research focuses on the different surgical techniques used to treat the ablepharon aspect of AMS. The primary goal of such research is to determine which methods are most effective for the patient without being unnecessarily complex. According to a study conducted by the departments of ophthalmology in Sao Paulo and Lima, Peru, full thickness skin grafts have been shown to effectively treat microblepharon in patients with AMS without needing complicated surgeries.

The film was released in the Hong Kong on 15 September 1977. Plot In the late ming andqing dynasties (1799-to 1800s), the Russians are consorting with the traitorous Manchus, who plan to turn over a map of the strategic points the Russians could use to invade Chinese territories. So, with the hope that he can sniff out their pan and the traitors (and not get killed like their first spy), the government sends out Chow Tien (John Lui) to investigate and spy on the visiting Russian General, Tolstoy (Roy Horan), and his lackeys. Since Tolstoy is a pistol expert, Tien gets his brother Ko (Yip Fei Yang), who is a dagger expert, and his tag along kid (Wong Yat Lung) to help aide him.

Life Tickell was the second son of the three sons and two daughters of John Tickell (1729‚Äì1782), a clerk in chancery, and magistrate in Dublin, and his wife Esther Pierson, and thus he was a grandson of the poet Thomas Tickell, who married the Irish heiress Clotilde Eustace, daughter of Sir Maurice Eustace of Harristown. Before his birth, his father had moved the family to New Windsor, Berkshire, as a result of disturbances in Dublin, so Richard Tickell is said to have been born at Bath, where he later built Beaulieu House, Newbridge Hill. Richard may have been educated at Harrow or Winchester and may have been an assistant at Eton, although this is contentious. He definitely entered the Middle Temple on 8 November 1768 to read for the law, and was later appointed as one of the sixty commissioners in bankruptcy. In 1778 he was deprived of this place, but regained it after his acquaintance David Garrick successfully petitioned Lord Chancellor Bathurst. Sheridan persuaded Tickell to use his satirical talent in support of Charles James Fox. On 15 October 1778 Tickell's musical entertainment The Camp was a success at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Three weeks later, Tickell declined to write a prologue for Garrick, due to other commitments, such as writing the satirical pamphlet \\"Anticipation\\". On 25 July 1780 Tickell married Mary Linley (1758‚Äì1787), a singer and a sister- in-law of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Tickell is said already to have had a family with a live-in mistress, referred to as Miss B. After his marriage, he was given a set of rooms in Hampton Court Palace. His opera in three acts The Carnival of Venice was successfully produced at Drury Lane, with its first performance on 13 December 1781. For this, Tickell's sister-in-law Elizabeth Linley wrote some of the songs, and his wife Mary the music. His adaptation of The Gentle Shepherd by Allan Ramsay, first performed on 27 May 1789, was his last work for the theatre. Some of his other plays and his pamphlets include: *\\"The Wreath of Fashion\\" (1778) *\\"The Green Box of Monsieur de Sartine\\", an adaptation from the French (1779) Sarah Ley by Richard Cosway Tickell's second wife, whom he married in 1789, was Sarah, a beautiful girl of eighteen, daughter of Captain Ley of the East India Company's service and the Berrington,This spelling appears in the source (Dictionary of National Biography, vol. 56, 1898). One East Indiaman was named Admiral Barrington. an East Indiaman. However, in 1793 financial difficulties led him into depression and ultimately to suicide on 4 November of that year, when he jumped from the parapet outside the window of his rooms at Hampton Court. Sheridan later convinced the Coroner to return a verdict of accidental death, and took the children of Tickell's first marriage into his care, obtaining admission into the Navy for Richard Tickell (1782‚Äì1805), and a writership in India for Samuel (1785‚Äì1817). R. E. Tickell maintained that the third child of this marriage was a daughter, Elizabeth Anne (1781‚Äì1860), who was unmarried when she died at her home in Bedford Square, London. It is certain, however, that Tickell had another daughter, Zipporah, who later married Ebenezer Roebuck, an employee of the East India Company, and became the mother of John Arthur Roebuck (1802‚Äì1879). Tickell's second wife's behaviour after his death gained her the censure of their contemporaries, as she was said to have had a small dowry but expensive tastes, keeping a coach and four but not paying her husband's debts. In 1796 she married again, John Cotton Worthington, a Major in the Sussex fencible cavalry.

Early years Pauline Murray was born in Waterhouses, County Durham, England, and her parents later moved to Ferryhill. She left school at age sixteen, studied art at Darlington College and then worked at odd jobs. In May 1976 the 18-year-old Murray saw the Sex Pistols perform, and she and her Ferryhill comrades became Pistols devotees, earning for themselves the title of \\"Durham Contingent\\" (coined by the NME). Penetration In late 1976, Murray formed a band with friends Robert Blamire and Gary Smallman and named it after the Stooges' song \\"Penetration.\\" They played their first gig in October 1976 at the Middlesbrough Rock Garden, and played their first gig in London at The Roxy in January 1977, supporting Gen X. The band debuted on vinyl with the single \\"Don't Dictate\\", issued by Virgin in November of the same year. The band went on to release two studio albums, Moving Targets and Coming Up for Air, as well as an official bootleg (Race Against Time). Later there would be a Best of Penetration compilation album. After a measure of success during 1978/79, including a headline show at the Rainbow Theatre and a five-week American tour, they announced a split in October 1979. Penetration played a number of gigs around London in 2001‚Äì2002, leading to a band reunion. In 2015 the band announced they would release Resolution, a new studio album. Solo work In 1980 Murray worked on her first solo album with record producer Martin Hannett's band The Invisible Girls, which also included ex-Penetration member and co-writer Robert Blamire, as well as guesting Manchester musicians such as Vini Reilly, guitarist in The Durutti Column, and Steve Hopkins. John Maher from Buzzcocks also drummed for the band. The resulting album, Pauline Murray and The Invisible Girls, reached Number 25 on the UK Albums Chart in October 1980 and spawned the singles \\"Dream Sequence\\" and \\"Mr. X\\".James Nice \\"Martin Hannett: A Certain Disorder in the Treble range\\" in Zero: a Martin Hannett story (Big Beat CDWIKCD 270 (2006)), p.16 of booklet. The album was well received by critics. A reviewer for Melody Maker called it, \\"Unquestionably a musical highpoint of this year or any other. An exciting new area of electronic pop where Motown meets the modern world.\\" Murray also provided vocals for The Only Ones on their song \\"Fools\\" and backing vocals on \\"Me and My Shadow\\". In the early 1980s, Murray formed the band Pauline Murray and The Storm, with Robert Blamire (bass), Tim Johnston (drums) and Paul Harvey (guitar), releasing the singles \\"Holocaust\\" in 1984, a cover of Alex Chilton/Big Star and the self-penned \\"New Age\\" in 1986. In 1989 Murray released the EP This Thing Called Love and the album Storm Clouds under her own name. In 2011 Murray established Polestar Studios with Robert Blamire in Byker where bands can rent out rehearsal and recording space. In 2013 she booked a number of solo acoustic dates around the North End in the UK. She said about the gigs, \\"This is the first time in my career that I‚Äôve done a full solo set with just me and my guitar.\\" During the tour, she played a number of older songs from her career and also played a number of new songs she had recently written. Personal life Murray was married to Peter Lloyd, Penetration's road manager, but split with her husband after the release of Searching for Heaven in 1980. She and Robert Blamire then became a couple and moved together to Liverpool. She currently resides in Newcastle upon Tyne. Murray has two children.

They are formed when secondary Calcium Carbonate or other carbonates accumulate in the subsoil to the extent that the soil becomes cemented into a hardpan. Petrocalcic horizons are similar to a duripan (ST - WRB: petroduric horizon) and a petrogypsic horizon (WRB) in how they affect land-use limitations. They can occur in conjunction with duripans where the conditions are right and there are enough free carbonates in the soil. Calcium Carbonates are found in alkaline soils, which are typical of arid and semiarid climates. A common field test for the presence of carbonates is application of hydrochloric acid to the soil, which indicates by fizzing and bubbling the presence of calcium carbonates. Characteristics The Required Characteristics of a petrocalcic horizon according to the Keys to USDA soil taxonomy, twelfth edition, 2014, are: #The horizon is cemented or indurated by carbonates, with or without silica or other cementing agents; and #Because of lateral continuity, roots can penetrate only along vertical fractures with a horizontal spacing of 10 cm or more; and #The horizon has a thickness of: #*10 cm or more or #*1 cm or more if it consists of a laminar cap directly underlain by bedrock. Genesis Petrocalcic horizons are typically found in older soils and are considered a mark of advanced soil evolution. Most petrocalcic formed before the Holocene age. They form in soil parent material that contains calcium carbonate or receive regular inputs of carbonates through dust. Carbonates are transported into the subsoil by water that precipitates the carbonates in the subsoil upon evaporation, eventually forming a massive, continuous layer of cemented carbonates. There is also some evidence that petrocalcic horizons can form \\"in situ\\" by alteration of limestone parent materials and alternating dissolution/precipitation of calcium carbonates.

Abernethy runs four outdoor activities centres and a bunkhouse in Scotland, providing outdoor instruction and residential facilities. The team staffed by committed Christians.  A History of Abernethy  Abernethy was established in 1971 when the Walker family donated their estate and buildings at Nethybridge. About 10 years later Miss Mary Currie, owner of the Hamilton Arms Hotel on the Isle of Arran, gave her property to be used as a Christian Centre resulting in the birth of the Arran Outdoor Centre. In 1984 the Trust accepted the gift of Brae Lodge at Loch Tay from Mr and Mrs Barratt, which ran under the Abernethy banner as the Ardeonaig Outdoor Centre. The fourth centre to come under Abernethy was the Ardgour Outdoor Centre on the Kilmalieu Estate, across the loch from Fort William. A few years later this centre became the home of the Abernethy Trust School of Adventure Leadership (in 1997). The last centre to be added to the Abernethy Trust was Barcaple Outdoor Centre, in 1996. This Centre was already operating as a Christian outdoor centre, independent from the Abernethy Trust, but Barcaple approached Abernethy asking if they could merge their ministry in Dumfries and Galloway with that of Abernethy. This officially happened on 1 January 2001. Around the same time it became apparent that the Arran Centre had reached the end of its effective period of service and the property was sold off and the proceeds used to support the other centres. Abernethy also runs an additional winter base at a Chalet in the Swiss Alps, and provide ski holidays from the end of December until the beginning of March.  About Abernethy  Abernethy caters to a wide range of people including (but not limited to): primary schools; youth groups (both Christian and non Christian); family weeks in the summer and winter; youth camps throughout the year; student expeditions; Charity and university groups. A range of training courses are also offered. The activities provided include: Abseiling, Archery, Bushcraft, Challenge Activities, Climbing and Bouldering, Coasteering, Crate Climbing, Dry Slope Skiing, High Ropes Course, Hill Walking, Jacobs Ladder, Kayaking, King Swing, Mountain Biking, Orienteering, Raft Building, Sailing, Sea Kayaking, Skiing, Snow Boarding, Team Building, Tree Climbing, Tree Top Trail, Weasling, Windsurfing, Zipwire. Each centre also boasts various facilities additional facilities including tennis court, swimming pool, squash court, games hall, dry ski slope, indoor climbing wall, games room and a theatre lounge - complete with fully equipped AV Facilities (although not all of the centres have all of these). The four Abernethy adventure centres are located at: # Nethybridge, a forest village in Inverness-shire, close to Loch Morlich and the River Spey # Ardeonaig, set on the South bank of Loch Tay in Highland Perthshire. # Ardgour, situated on the shores of Loch Linnhe # Barcaple, situated on the edge of the Southern Uplands between the Solway coast and the Galloway hills And Glen Kin, the bunkhouse, is situated near Dunoon.

Since April 2014, he has been the Vice President (VP) of Dwindle Distribution. Biography =Early life= Douglas was born in 1967 in North London. He began skateboarding at the age of 10 at various skateparks in the city, such as Uxbridge, Skate City, Rolling Thunder skate park, Crystal Palace Vert Ramp, and Harrow Skate Park. Douglas frequented Harrow from the day it opened, along with Rodga Harvey, John Sablosky and Jeremy Henderson. Later, the \\"H-Boyz crew\\" Douglas helped found would become regulars at Harrow Skate Park. =Skateboarding= In 1981, at the insistence of skate-photographer Tim Leighton-Boyce, Douglas began entering English Skateboard Association (ESA) contests. He won all the \\"under-16\\" events that he had entered. Douglas' success caught the attention of American sponsors such as Madrid Skateboards, Vans Shoes, Independent Trucks and Quicksilver Surf Wear . Throughout the early 1980s, Douglas wrote and published a skateboarding magazine with Benjamin Thomas called Go For It!, named after a Stiff Little Fingers record. In the absence of any other topical periodical Douglas and Thomas' magazine became influential within the British skateboarding scene. A total of 16 issues were produced, the last three of which were in a glossy, printed form. The penultimate issue, entitled the Swindle Issue, only had one glossy cover. In 1984, the ESA managed to convince their US counterparts, the NSA, to label their contest series as a 'world championship' so the ESA could obtain government grants to send a UK team to participate. The first-ever UK team included Douglas, Harvey, Lucian Hendrix, and Sean Goff. In 1986, following the release of a Go For It! calendar, Douglas prioritized overseas work commitments and Go For It! closed. By this time, Tim Leighton-Boyce's R.A.D. publication was available, followed by Shane Rouse's Skate Action and Steve Kane's Skateboard. Douglas was assigned a professional status in 1987 by his skateboard deck sponsor, Schmitt Stix . The company released a Douglas signature model deck in 1988, which featured a picture of a spoof beer bottle label with the caption: 'Imported from Crystal Palace, London, England'. After releasing a final signature model, Paul Schmitt decided to dissolve Schmitt Stix, at Douglas' behest. Schmitt then relaunched under a new name, 'New Deal Skateboards,' with a new team, new product line and renewed focus. Schmitt, a notable international skateboard manufacturer at that time, created the new brand with Douglas and Andy Howell. Douglas used the 'New Deal' name to co- found a skate shop in London, originally located in a retail unit in the Harrow and Wealdstone shopping mall and later moved to Harrow Solid Surf Skatepark. Along with Tony Magnusson's H-Street and Steve Rocco's World Industries, New Deal developed into a successful skateboard brand in the early 1990s by embracing the emerging street-based skateboarding revolution that favored new skateboarders such as Ed Templeton, who appeared in New Deal's first promotional video, Useless Wooden Toys (1990).SkimTheFat - Your Guide to Skateboarding Videos Bolstered by New Deal's success, Douglas co-founded the Giant Distribution skateboard company in the early 1990s Giant Skateboard Distribution and eventually became the company's president. Hugh \\"Bod\\" Boyle, Douglas' UK friend and former professional skateboarder, eventually joined the company after a knee injury prematurely ended his skating career in the early 1990s. Boyle won the skateboarding World Championship in 1990.Hugh \\"Bod\\" Boyle In 1992, Howell decided to form his own skateboard brand. With Douglas' help they founded 'Underworld Element', later renamed to Element Skateboards, which remains a prominent skateboard company today. John Lucero, Douglas' teammate first at Madrid then at Schmitt Stix, started his own skateboard brand in 1988 called 'Lucero Skateboards,' soon renamed Black Label Skateboards. By the mid-1990s, Black Label was run out of a garage and Douglas restructured the company to further facilitate its growth. Douglas also co-founded 411 video magazine 411VM and later the On Video series, both crucial to skateboarding's development through the 1990s and the new millennium. He also founded a new truck company in the late 1990s, Destructo Trucks, with the usual success, and took over production of Bam Margera's notorious CKY before Margera moved the series to television. In 2004 Douglas accepted an offer from Burton Snowboards to be general manager at their clothing subsidiary Analog.SURF Magazine A year later Douglas was reunited with his old friend 'Bod' Boyle when they both came to work at Giant's rival Dwindle Distribution; Boyle as president and Douglas in an advisory position. In addition to his work at skateboarding companies, Douglas is also a committee member of both the IASC and USA Skateboarding, the national governing Body of American skateboarding.

Impressed by the fighter's skills, General Chow arranges for Hu Lung to meet the Minister of Royal Security as a potential candidate for joining the Ming forces. While sparring in the courtyard to test his skills, Hu Lung produces a knife and assassinates the Minister before leaping over the courtyard wall and escaping. As General Chow rushes to the Minister's aid, the guards arrive and immediately arrest Chow for the murder. En route to the court, a group of soldiers arrives with orders to kill Chow, who defeats the group and escapes. Ming Minister of State Cheng (Lee), an authoritarian ruler and master of the Eagle Claw and Iron Armor techniques, summons his most skilled enforcer, Shen Yu (Wong), to hunt down Chow and arrest him. Chow hunts for Hu Lung, but must avoid the authorities along the way who are attempting to kill him. He eventually finds Hu Lung, but is thwarted by Shen Yu as Hu runs away. Chow informs Shen Yu that he has been wrongly accused and that Hu Lung is the actual murderer, but Shen is not convinced and he fights with Chow. The fight is interrupted by an old man claiming to also be after General Chow, and fights with Shen over who will get to bring him in. Chow uses this opportunity to escape and continues his pursuit of Hu Lung. The old man is later revealed to be Hu Lung's old teacher, who previously expelled Hu from their clan. Hu confesses to his old teacher that he was paid by Minister Cheng, a former classmate of the old man, to carry out the assassination. The old man confronts the Minister over his actions and sets a trap to kill him, but is killed by Cheng in their ensuing fight. Meanwhile, Chow learns the Iron Finger technique from the old man's grandson and granddaughter to defeat Cheng's Iron Armor, but his training is cut short when Shen Yu and a 2nd enforcer sent by the Minister arrive to arrest him again. After the 2nd enforcer attempts to kill Chow over Shen's objections but fails, Shen begins to doubt Chow's guilt and gives him three days to locate Hu Lung and clear his name. Before he can catch up with Hu Lung, Hu is killed by Cheng, however Shen discovers evidence on Hu's body that the Minister was involved. Minister Cheng's plot is exposed and he is confronted by Chow, Shen Yu, and the old man's two grandchildren. During the fight, Chow discovers that Cheng's weak spot is his testicles and that Cheng is able to retract them into his body for protection. Through the group's combined efforts, Chow is able to use his Iron Finger technique to cause Cheng to drop his testicles so Chow and crush them, killing Cheng.

Part of the site is also in Central Bedfordshire. At the 2011 Census the population of the new town was included in the civil parish of Wilstead. History The 750 acre (3 km¬≤) brownfield site for the Wixams development is located just to the south of Bedford, and was formerly known as the Elstow Storage Depot; and in World War II, as ROF Elstow. The provisional name of the development during the early planning stages was Elstow Garden Villages, (Elstow is a nearby village famous for its association with John Bunyan). The name 'Wixams' \\"Naming the New Settlement\\", . Accessed 25 June 2008. derives from Wixamtree, an ancient hundred near to where the new town is situated. (It is actually in the ancient hundred of Redbournestoke.) Wixams is planned to ultimately consist of four \\"villages\\", each with its own centre, built around a town centre. It is expected to have 4,500 homes, and is likely to provide housing capacity for people who work in Bedford, Milton Keynes and London. In addition, there is an intention to develop employment in Wixams itself. Facilities which are scheduled to be constructed include: * Over a million square feet of office space * Three lower schools (ages 5‚Äì9), two middle schools (9‚Äì13) and one upper school (13‚Äì18)- on hold due to Bedford Borough most likely moving to two tier. * A primary healthcare centre- on hold until resident numbers reach 15,000 to 20,000. * A town park- likely to include an Asda * A range of shops * A library * A sports hall * Over of parkland and public open space, featuring a series of lakes, water bodies and wetland areas. These are a legacy of the former open cast mineral extraction on the site, which lies within the Forest of Marston Vale, a brickmaking and gravel extraction area with many exhausted pits * A large waste incinerator (capacity 0.5 million tons of waste per annum). Gallagher Estates is the master development company for the whole of Wixams. The first area or village of development is known as Lakeview (previously Village One). Developers include Bloor Homes, Careys New Homes, Lagan Homes, Leech Homes, Miller Homes and Taylor Wimpey. Village Two is currently in development, with homes being construction by Barratt Developments under both their Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes brands. Wixam Village Three is planned to include the town center and a rail link, offering a direct connection to Bedford and London. Infrastructure works carried out by ECL Civil Engineering includes in excess of 40,000m2 of new carriageways. The first residents of Lakeview moved into the area in early 2009, but construction work has proceeded more slowly than forecast due to the late 2000s recession and the consequent state of the UK housing market. In August 2009, the first housing association properties were let to residents in Lakeview, with shared-ownership homes also becoming available. The first lower school in Wixams, Lakeview Lower School opened in September 2009. In late summer 2010, the Wixams Community Group was formed from residents who have moved to the new town.http://www.wixams.net/?page_id=2 Site preparation works for the Village Two and Village Three areas of Wixams commenced in early 2011.http://www.wixams.net/wp- content/uploads/2011/03/Community-Newsletter-8.pdf Between February 2011 and December 2015, the Reverend Tim Jackson served as the first ecumenical church minister. Funded by the Bedfordshire Ecumenical Committee, Tim represents the Anglican, Baptist, Methodist and United Reformed Christian denominations. However, there is no church building at present. After Tim's departure, church activities continue in the form of Sunday Worship, Messy Church and Little Stars. In January 2012, Sophie, Countess of Wessex made an official visit to Wixams. The princess visited Lakeview Lower School, and met Dave Hodgson (Mayor of Bedford Borough), Andrew Slack (High Sheriff of Bedfordshire), Tony Gallagher (chairman of Gallagher Estates) as well as pupils and staff from the school. Bedford Borough Council reported that over 600 homes were occupied in Lakeview by the end of 2012. A village hall has been constructed in Lakeview and officially opened in April 2013. The hall is managed by members of a local community trust and Company limited by guarantee.http://www.wixams.net/wixams_files/newsletters/2012-january.pdf A purpose built retirement village for the over-55s is due to open on a 6-acre site adjacent to Lakeview, within Wixams. This retirement village is due to open in 2019. In April 2018, plans were announced that would see the creation of 1,400 new jobs within Wixams. Planning permission has been granted for B&M; to construct a one million sq ft distribution centre which will create around 1,000 new jobs; and for Aldi to construct a new 800,000 sq ft distribution centre which will create around 400 new jobs. Both distribution centres are to be constructed on a site just north of the existing Wilstead Industrial Park. Governance Village One of the Wixams development (Lakeview) was previously part of the Wilshamstead civil parish, with residents entitled to vote in elections for Wilshamstead Parish Council (Wilshamstead is the parish name for the village of Wilstead, which is located on the other side of the A6 road). However, in April 2015 Wixams civil parish was created, with the first elections to the parish council on 7th May.http://www.bedford.gov.uk/council_and_democracy/elections/community_governance_reviews/2013_reviews/wilstead- wixams.aspx The as yet undeveloped parts of Wixams currently lie in the Stewartby and Houghton Conquest civil parishes. Wixams forms part of the Mid Bedfordshire constituency, represented in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Parliament. The current MP for the Mid Bedfordshire constituency is Nadine Dorries, who is a member of the Conservative Party. Transport Wixams is adjacent to the A6 trunk road, part of which was diverted to a new section of dual carriageway in 2007/08 to make space for the development. Wixams railway station was a planned new railway station to be built in Wixams, which would have been an intermediate stop on the Midland Main Line between Bedford railway station and Flitwick railway station. The station was initially planned to be built by 2015, but continued wrangling over funding for the project has meant that the date has continued to slip indefinitely. Currently, Wixams is served by two major bus routes. The first is operated by Grant Palmer of Dunstable under the service number 44. The route runs from Bedford town centre through Wixams and also serves Wilstead, Clophill, Ampthill and Flitwick every hour. The other, numbered 81 and operated by Stagecoach East, runs from Bedford town centre through Wixams to Wilstead, Clophill, Silsoe, Barton-le-Clay and to Luton every hour. There are no footpath or bridlepath rights of way leading out of Wixams into the surrounding countryside. Wixams is not connected to the surrounding network of countryside rights of way. Education Wixams contains two primary schools and a secondary school. The first primary school constructed for the settlement, Lakeview School, opened to pupils in September 2009. The architectural firm Mouchel designed the school, and the Morgan Sindall Group constructed the building. The school has been controversial, as the first headteacher was appointed months before construction of the school began. The school had seven pupils on its roll when it opened. In January 2012, Sophie, Countess of Wessex visited the school and unveiled a plaque. Two new schools opened in Wixams in September 2017. One was the town's first secondary school, Wixams Academy, and the other a new primary school built adjacent to the secondary school, called Wixams Tree Primary.

Plot Anoop studies law in Calcutta, while his widowed mom lives in a small town in West Bengal. He has a sister, Sudha, who is married to Anil and lives in Calcutta. Since Anoop is of marriageable age, his mom has selected a prospective bride for him in her neighbourhood. The girl's name is Vidya. When Anoop returns home, his mother asks him for his approval, but he says he wants to see the girl first. He goes to see Vidya, and also gets to meet another village belle by the name of Minoo, the daughter of Sharda and Ramchandra. He returns home, tells his mom that he cannot marry Vidya, and will marry only Minoo. His mother reluctantly agrees and the marriage takes place. It is then that they find out that Minoo has no household skills. Neither is she educated, nor mature enough to understand her relationship with Anoop. Her only interests appear to be stealing mangoes and other fruit, and playing with children much younger than her. Anoop's mom is quite exasperated with Minoo and is compelled to keep the new bride under lock and key. When the time comes for Anoop to return to Calcutta, he asks Minoo to come with him, but she refuses. His mother cannot handle Minoo's childishness and refuses to let her stay with her. Anoop accordingly leaves Minoo with her mom, Sharda. Once Anoop leaves her and heads back to Calcutta, Minoo starts realising she misses him. All her earlier activities of fooling around and playing with the village kids loses their charm and, in her loneliness, she realises her love for Anoop. She then tells her mom that she wants to go back to Anoop's house, reconcile with her mother-in-law and live with her. Minoo goes back, a changed person. Anoop's mom welcomes her daughter-in-law. Minoo excels in her household duties. But Anoop does not visit even for his holidays. Minoo realises that, when she had refused to accompany him to Calcutta, Anoop's ego was bruised. He had promised that he would come only when she wrote to him to come back. So she writes a letter to Anoop telling him to come home. But she does not have his address, so Anoop never gets the letter. In the meantime, Anoop's mom, realizing that Minoo is truly missing her husband, suggests a trip to Calcutta to visit him. It is in Anoop's sister's house in Calcutta that the love-lorn couple finally comes together. Cast *Swarup Dutta as Anoop (as Swaroop Dutt) * Jaya Bhaduri as Minoo a.k.a.

As of 2018, it has placed over 6,000 assistance dogs with recipients at no charge. right  Foundations  Canine Companions for Independence was founded in Santa Rosa, California in July 1975 by Bonnie Bergin as the first program of its kind. While teaching in Asia, she had seen burros being used by disabled people and thought that dogs could serve a similar role in the US. Since then, it has grown to a national organization with six regions. The organization pairs people with disabilities with highly trained assistance dogs and ongoing support at no cost to the recipient. All expenses of the dogs breeding, raising, and training, are paid for by private donations from separate foundations, corporations, or individuals, as well as fundraising projects. It is estimated that each assistance dog and a lifetime of follow up support costs $50,000. The Lions Club Project for Canine Companions for Independence (LPCCI), which was founded in 1983 as a significant provider of financial and volunteer support to Canine Companions, has donated a total of $2 million. In 2015, Canine Companions partnered with Henry Schein Animal Health, a provider of animal health products to veterinarians, which provides puppy raisers with free health care products. A special program, \\"The Veterans Initiative,\\" provides trained service dogs for disabled and injured veterans. The program received funding from a partnership between PetSmart and Canine Companions. In December 2014, the organization joined the United States Department of Veterans Affairs in a study to determine whether service dogs improve the quality of life for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. In 2017, the organization worked with Chrysler brand on a new social online social initiative to raise awareness and support for the work done by Canine Companions. The campaign, \\"Give a Dog a Job,\\" let people follow along with the training of a particular puppy, and engage with him and his trainers on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.  The dogs  Canine Companions trains four types of dogs- service dogs (mobility assistance and service dogs for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder), skilled companions trained to work with an adult or child with a disability under the guidance of a facilitator, hearing dogs for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, and dogs for \\"facility teams.\\" Facility teams are made up of a dog and partner, who is usually a rehabilitation specialist, educator, or medical specialist. These dogs carry most of the skills of service dogs as well as specialized skills for whatever type of facility the dog will be working in to be integrated into therapies.  Breeding and raising  Canine Companions employs a breeding program to supply their dogs. They use Golden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers or crosses of the two breeds. Puppies are raised by volunteers who commit to keeping the dogs for 18 months, until it is time for them to enter the training program.  Training  The four- to nine-month professional training begins when the dog is returned by the volunteer puppy raisers to one of Canine Companions' six regional centers across the US. The first three months of training reviews what the dogs have learned. Professional training includes in-depth health and temperament assessments, and each dog learns over 40 commands to increase independence including pulling a manual wheelchair, retrieving dropped items and opening doors. Dogs may be trained as hearing dogs that alert their deaf handler to sounds in the environment and lead the handler to the source of the sound. In 2018, Canine Companions began a pilot program training service dogs to assist veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder by providing a gentle buffer in crowds, turning on lights and interrupting nightmares and anxiety behaviors. Individuals invited to be matched with a dog travel to the regional center that serves their state for a two-week class that teaches the recipients how to work with their new partners. This includes learning about dog psychology, dog grooming and care as well as the commands that the dogs know. Matching the dogs with the person is done carefully to make sure their activity levels and personalities match. At the conclusion, the individuals go through testing and then participate in a graduation ceremony. Canine Companions teams return for routine follow-up over the course of the placement. Canine Companions dog users may also periodically return for reunions or extra follow-up training at any time. Their usual term in service is eight to ten years.

Biography At the age of 15, Livingstone moved to the United Kingdom. Livingstone's first record was released without his knowledge: A tenant in the building where he and a friend jammed recorded some of these sessions released some tracks on the Planetone record label. When London-based Carnival Records was seeking a Jamaican vocal duo, Livingstone filled the requirement by double-tracking his own voice, releasing records in this fashion under the name Sugar & Dandy. One of these singles, \\"What a Life\\", sold 25,000 copies, providing Livingstone with his first hit. When called on to perform live, Roy Smith was recruited to make up the duo, although he would be replaced by Tito \\"Sugar\\" Simon. In 1967, Livingstone signed with Ska Beat Records, for whom he recorded his debut album 1967's Rocksteady with Dandy. In 1968, Livingstone moved into production, and formed a duo with Audrey Hall (as Dandy & Audrey). His production of other artists included The Marvels' debut album and hit singles by Nicky Thomas (\\"Suzanne Beware of The Devil\\") and Tony Tribe (\\"Red Red Wine\\"). In the late 1960s, Livingstone worked with the trombonist Rico Rodriguez, who was featured on \\"Rudy, A Message to You\\". Rodriguez later played with The Specials, whose 1979 cover version of the song made it famous. Livingstone produced several singles for Rodriguez under the name Rico & the Rudies. Livingstone signed to Trojan Records in 1968, releasing two albums, Follow That Donkey and Dandy Returns. A Trojan subsidiary, Down Town Records, was set up to release Livingstone's output, both as a singer and producer, and the J-Dan subsidiary served the same purpose in the early 1970s. Livingstone returned to Jamaica, living there until 1973. Livingstone resurfaced in 1973 with the single \\"Black Star\\" on Mooncrest Records and the album Conscious. On his return to the UK, he recorded a self-titled album at Byron Lee's studio. It was announced on 11 September 2011 that Livingstone would be performing for the first time in over 40 years at the 2012 London International Ska Festival on 3‚Äì6 May. Though it was announced on stage that he had been present at the sound check, he did not perform.

Cherry Hill is a predominantly residential area in Seattle, Washington located south of Capitol Hill within the Central District, north of the International District, and east of First Hill. Cherry Hill is bound by 14th Avenue, 23rd Avenue, East Madison Street and East Yesler Way. Cherry Hill overlaps considerably with the neighborhood of Squire Park as defined by the Squire Park Neighborhood Council. In the Seattle City Clerk's Geographic Indexing Atlas, Cherry Hill is designated as the Minor neighborhood of the Central Area. Cherry Hill was previously called Second Hill or Renton Hill.  Geography  Cherry Hill is located on a north-south ridge situated east of the Seattle downtown area and First Hill, roughly equidistant between Puget Sound and Lake Washington. The neighborhood of Capitol Hill resides on the northern two-thirds of this ridge, while Cherry Hill resides on the southern third, with East Madison Street serving as the boundary between the two. The highest point of elevation in Cherry Hill is 420 feet above sea level at the broadcast towers on East Madison Street.https://www.topozone.com/washington/king-wa/city/seattle/ Despite the fact that Cherry Hill and Capitol Hill designate adjacent regions of a single ridge, they are considered by Seattle historian Walt Crowley as two of the Seven Hills of Seattle. View of Capitol Hill and Cherry Hill neighborhoods, looking east along Union Ave. Cherry Hill resides to the east and south of Capitol Hill, equivalent to behind and to the right in this view. Cherry Hill landmarks visible include the three broadcast towers at Madison Street and 18th Ave, the Temple De Hirsch Sinai with its gray conical frustrum in the center of the photo, and the Church of the Immaculate Conception at Marion St and 18th Ave with its two white towers near the right of the photo. View of Cherry Hill circa 1905. At that time it was called either Second Hill or Renton Hill. Running diagonally through the image from bottom-right to top- left is Madison Street. Intersecting Madison Street in the center of the image and running to the top-right is Union Street. The cupola of the original T. T. Minor School is visible at the crest of the hill between Madison and Union Street. The original school building was razed and replaced with the current one in the 1940s. The current-day location of the broadcast towers would be at the top of Madison Street in this photo. History The northern section of current-day Cherry Hill near Madison Street was originally named Second Hill, then later Renton Hill. The portion of the current-day Cherry Hill neighborhood bounded by Union and Cherry Streets and 10th and 20th Streets was added to the city of Seattle in 1870 as the Edes and Knight addition, and was replatted in 1890.https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Neighborhoods/HistoricPreservation/HistoricResourcesSurvey/context- central- area.pdfhttps://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Neighborhoods/MajorInstitutions/SwedishCherryHill/PrelimDraftEIS-2013-11-07.pdf A more southern section between Cherry and Alder Streets and 12th and 20th Avenues was added in 1890 as the Squire Park addition, after former Washington Territory governor and US Senator Watson Squire, who formerly owned the land in that section.https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/Neighborhoods/HistoricPreservation/Landmarks/RelatedDocuments/DesRptCarmack.pdf The name Cherry Hill was suggested by city councilmember Harlan Edwards in 1959 to describe the area for an Urban Renewal Project bounded by Cherry and Yesler Streets and 17th and 23rd Avenues, which includes Squire Park.Unknown article, 1959-01-21, Seattle Times The name Cherry Hill was subsequently widely used throughout this area in the 1960s and 1970s, and was also used for structures north of Cherry Street such as the Cherry Hill Community Center and the Cherry Hill Baptist Church. The naming of a larger neighborhood named Squire Park bounded by Union and Jackson Streets and 12th and 23rd Avenues appeared with the establishment of the Squire Park Neighborhood Council in 1986. The renaming of Providence Hospital to Swedish Medical Center Cherry Hill in 2007 reintroduced the name Cherry Hill to the area from Madison Street to the hospital. From 1959 to 1976 the Cherry Hill Urban Renewal Project mentioned above‚Äîalso known as Conservation Project No. 1‚Äîwas Seattle's first urban renewal project.https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/CityArchive/Gazette/gazette32.pdf The area between Cherry Street and Yesler Way has seen a number of progressions, with a large number of Scandinavians at the beginning of the 20th century, evolving to a predominantly Jewish neighborhood through the 1960s and a predominantly African-American neighborhood in the 1980s.https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/Neighborhoods/HistoricPreservation/Landmarks/RelatedDocuments/DesRptCarmack.pdf From 2016 to 2020, the Lutheran Church of the Good Shepherd and the Low Income Housing Institute sponsored a tiny house village at the corner of Union Street and 22nd Avenue. In 2020, a new tiny house village named was established on the southeast corner of Cherry Street and 22nd Avenue, on land formerly belonging to the Christ Spirit Church (formerly the Cherry Hill Baptist Church). The enduring nature of both the Cherry Hill and Squire Park neighborhood names may be explained by advantages of each. Cherry Hill serves as a convenient replacement for the Renton Hill name, which has fallen out of favor, and acknowledges that the neighborhood shares a geographic feature with the adjacent Capitol Hill neighborhood while maintaining Madison St as the traditional southern border of Capitol Hill. Squire Park has the advantage of historical continuity and usage in property records, although this only applies for the region between Cherry and Alder Streets. Designating Cherry Hill and Squire Park as two different neighborhoods separated by Cherry Street may be a way to retain both names, although this would entail assigning the entire area originally named Cherry Hill in 1959 to Squire Park.

Plot It consists of six stories from the fairy tale tradition, all performed by the Muppet characters and narrated by Rizzo and Gonzo at the Muppet Theater: =The Three Little Pigs= Papa Pig tells his three children Andy, Randy, and Sandy (played by Miss Piggy) that it's time for them all to live on their own. Papa tells Andy and Randy that they are strong smart boys who can take care of themselves, but they need to look after their sister Sandy. While the two dumb brothers build flimsy homes of straw and sticks, Sandy constructs a state-of-the-art brick house. At night, The Big Bad Wolf comes and blows down Andy and Randy's houses. The siblings turn to Sandy for shelter, and she only lets them stay if they promise to show her some respect. The Big Bad Wolf returned the next day demanding that Sandy lets him in and reminds the pigs that they are supposed to say \\"Not By the Hair of My Chinny Chin Chin.\\" Sandy opens up the door and karate chops the Big Bad Wolf when she accuses him of his claim that Sandy has facial hair. The Big Bad Wolf then starts to blow Sandy's house down which has no effect. Then the Big Bad Wolf disguises himself as the pizza delivery man only for Sandy to take the pizza. The Big Bad Wolf's latest plan involves dressing up as Santa Claus and going down the chimney. Andy and Randy almost fall for this until Sandy reminds them that it's the middle of summer. When Andy and Randy think that Santa Claus came early, Sandy ends up lighting a large firecracker in the chimney which launches the Big Bad Wolf into the sky. =King Midas= King Midas (played by Kermit the Frog) spares the life of a satyr (played by Gonzo) that was sleeping in his garden after the satyr offers to grant King Midas a wish. When King Midas wants world peace, Queen Midas (Played by Piggy) wanted money and they are granted the Golden Touch. King Midas then uses his talents to turn people's items into gold. When King Midas accidentally turns himself to gold upon reacting to his food being turned to gold, Queen Midas tries various attempts to get him back to normal. The satyr tells Queen Midas that the effects of the Golden Touch can be undone if Queen Midas renounces her interest in gold. The satyr then offers to give King Midas and Queen Midas another wish for free. While King Midas still wanted world peace, Queen Midas wanted a Slice-O-Matic in green. Rizzo the Rat narrated that King Midas, Queen Midas, and the satyr used the Slice-O-Matic to throw fabulous dinner parties for everyone in the kingdom. =The Boy Who Cried Wolf= The repeated overreactions of a young shepherd (played by Gonzo) cause the villagers and their mayor (played by Kermit) to doubt his word when he has made claims of sensing earthquakes and tsunamis. When the wolf shows up and challenges the shepherd to obtain help within 24 hours before he eats his sheep, the shepherd goes through every attempts to prove that the wolf is threatening the sheep. After all attempts have failed, the sheep state that the shepherd learned his lesson and protested to end the story before the wolf arrives. Rizzo the Rat narrates that the story is not over yet despite the protests of the sheep and that the wolf would return in one hour. One of the rams mentions to the shepherd and his fellow sheep about his cousin Norman and they come up with a plan. When the wolf arrives, the shepherd stated that the wolf was right about the drop in his credibility as his final quote to him is \\"big sheep.\\" The wolf ends up being surprised by the arrival of a large ram named Norman who ends up crushing the wolf. The wolf briefly gets up by quoting \\"That's what you mean about really big sheep\\" and ends up crushed again. The shepherd and the sheep then chant Norman's name. The mayor gives the shepherd a medal for \\"not crying wolf except when an actual wolf was present\\". The townspeople and the sheep rejoiced and lived happily ever after while the wolf is still trapped under Norman. When Rizzo asks Gonzo if he has learned his lesson, Gonzo states that he won't overreact again, until Rizzo states that they'll be taking an intermission with Rizzo having to explain to Gonzo what an intermission is (American Version). Gonzo and Rizzo signing off the viewers and it's time to polka (European Version). =Rumpelstiltskin= A sad and lonely King (played by Kermit) turns to his Loyal Royal Advisor to find him a fair young maiden to be his queen, someone who is special. The King also tells his Loyal Royal Advisor that he will be given his own castle if he succeeds. All the fairest maidens in the land were brought to the King's castle so that one of them can become queen. Wanting the attention of the King, a miller (played by Papa Pig) claims to the Loyal Royal Advisor that his daughter Piggy can spin straw into gold when he brings her to the King's Castle. Piggy is placed in a room full of straw where the Loyal Royal Advisor (who still wants to fulfill getting his own castle from the King) orders her to demonstrate her gift that her father claims that she has or else she will be spending the rest of her life in the dungeon. She ends up receiving the assistance of Rumpelstiltskin (played by Gonzo) who spins the straw into gold upon Piggy giving him her necklace. The next morning, the Loyal Royal Advisor discovers the golden straw and states that he'll keep an eye on the gold that is present while Piggy spins the second batch of straw into gold. When Rumpelstiltskin returns that night and wants a fee to convert the straw into gold, she is forced by fate to give up her firstborn upon becoming queen in return for the desperately needed services of Rumpelstiltskin. The next morning, the King and the Loyal Royal Advisor came in and found the golden straw. The King married Piggy and the Loyal Royal Advisor got his own castle. When Queen Piggy finally had her child, Rumpelstiltskin came in and states that he will let her keep her child if he can guess his name. If she can't guess his name by tomorrow, then the child will end up in the possession of Rumpelstiltskin. Piggy called the King, the Loyal Royal Advisor, and her father where she told them the whole truth about her having help in converting straw into gold. The King mentioned that he married Piggy because he loved her which surprised the Loyal Royal Advisor and her father. The four of them get to work at guessing Rumpelstiltskin's name. When the deadline is up, Rumpelstiltskin returns to see if Piggy has guessed his name and nearly gave it away. Upon recalling that Rumpelstiltskin went to \\"Camp Weido,\\" he has her father and the Loyal Royal Advisor grab him while stating to the King that \\"a good mother always sews their child's name in their clothes before sending them off to camp.\\" Piggy finds the label that lists Rumpelstiltskin's name and reads it out loud. Rumpelstiltskin declares it an outrage while Piggy, the King, the Loyal Royal Advisor, and the Miller celebrate. =The Emperor's New Clothes= In the kingdom of Fozzalia, three rat tricksters (played by Rizzo the Rat, Yolanda the Rat, and Montague the Rat) are in the town square showing off their Curative Elixirs. Robin the Frog doubts Rizzo's claim while another man stated that the Curative Elixir \\"cured his baldness\\" as a rat is seen on top of his head. The young boy states that the rat is on the man's head which the man notices. The rat jumps off the man's head as the rat tells Rizzo that the jig is up. Rizzo is arrested by the Police Chief and is taken to Emperor Fozzie Bear. Upon being brought to Emperor Fozzie, Rizzo claims to him that the rest of his wardrobe is shabby due to it not being special enough. Rizzo states that he happens to be the finest tailor in all the land. Emperor Fozzie then asks for Rizzo to make him some new clothes as Rizzo sends the Emperor to obtain gold for payment and to meet him in the Royal Dressing Room for a fitting. Rizzo has Yolanda take measurements in preparation for his new clothes while Montague weaves the finest fabric in all the land. Rizzo claims that the special fabric can only be seen by elegant people such as the Emperor. Emperor Fozzie then \\"sees\\" the fabric in question. Members of the Emperor's Court claim to not see it until they do after the Emperor claims that they aren't \\"elegant enough.\\" The rats then present Fozzie with his \\"new clothes\\" that are on the hanger that Rizzo gives him. Before Rizzo can lead Yolanda and Montague to their next business in Tarzana, Emperor Fozzie states that he will hold a celebration to show off his new clothes with the rats being his guests of honor. At the celebration, Rizzo gives the crowd a heads up stating that Emperor Fozzie's new clothes can only be seen by the elegant. When Emperor Fozzie goes out to show his new clothes, Robin notices that Emperor Fozzie is wearing nothing but his boxers. Emperor Fozzie notices this as the members of his Court end up using their bodies to cover him. The citizens of Fozzalia think that since Emperor Fozzie isn't wearing clothing and that public nudity must be the latest fad Emperor Fozzie tells his people that they should stop doing things just because he does them, and that they should start thinking for themselves. As Rizzo, Yolanda, and Montague try to take their leave, they are caught by the Police Chief. Gonzo narrates that the Emperor and his kingdom learned that it's best to think for themselves and follow their own fashion. As for Rizzo, Yolanda, and Montague, they lived happily ever after, while serving 10 years in the palace dungeon. When Rizzo states that they should visit a Sultan who is so gullible when they get out, Yolanda and Montague end up kicking Rizzo. =The Elves and the Shoemaker= A shoemaker (played by Kermit) and his nephew Robin are visited by the local banker who demands his money by tomorrow or he will toss them into the street. The shoemaker states that they haven't been having good business lately since they've been making ugly shoes and all will be lost if there is nothing else to do about it. When the shoemaker and his nephew Robin go to sleep, their house is visited by a group of philanthropic entertainer elves (all dressed like Elvis Presley) and make blue suede shoes. The next morning, the shoemaker and Robin woke up to find the blue suede shoes and a bunch of customers outside of their store. By the time night had fallen, every shoe in the shop has been sold and the banker takes the money stating that he'll be back tomorrow for the other half of \\"his money.\\" When Robin hopes for another miracle that involves whoever helped them to return, the shoemaker states that they will be ready to find out who has been helping them. Once the shoemaker and his nephew have fallen asleep, they awoke in time to see the elves working on the blue suede shoes. When morning comes, the store is packed with eager customers and the banker takes the other half of the money. Upon watching the elves at work, the shoemaker tells Robin that it's time he thanked them for their kindness. Rizzo ends up coming on stage to suggest a gift to give to the elves. The shoemaker and Robin worked through the night to make a special gift to thank the elves. When the elves arrived at midnight, the shoemaker and Robin present them with white sequined jumpsuits. While the shoemaker and Robin live happily ever after, the elves relocated to Las Vegas where they perform two shows. Note: During this story, Rizzo walks onstage to speak to Kermit and Robin about a gift to give the elves. As Steve Whitmire was already performing Kermit, he could not puppeteer for Rizzo at the same time and Rizzo's voice is that of Dave Goelz. =Finale= As Gonzo and Rizzo close out the show while dancing with Kermit and Robin, the elves sing \\"Bad Shoe Blues\\" during the credits.

Snell was sentenced to death for one of the murders, and executed by lethal injection in 1995.  Background  Richard Snell was a member of the white supremacist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (known as the CSA), which was started in 1971 in the small community of Elijah, Missouri, by polygamist James Ellison. He was also a believer in the Christian Identity religion, and frequented Elohim City, a private community located in Oklahoma. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) had ongoing investigations into the organization. By the end of their operations, the ATF obtained 155 Krugerrands (gold coins), one live light antitank rocket (LAW), 94 long guns, 30 handguns, 35 sawed-off shotguns and machine guns, one light machine gun (a Japanese copy of the World War I Lewis, in .303 caliber), and three and a half bars of C-4 explosives. Much of this arsenal had been stolen. Snell was involved in the filming of planes that landed at Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport in Mena, Arkansas, thought of by Snell and many conspiracy theorists to be used in a government-sanctioned operation of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to smuggle drugs into the United States. Snell had claimed that law enforcement agencies, both state and those local to that area of western Arkansas, were involved in the cover-up of the Mena airport drug smuggling. He had also made claims that he had filmed the then-Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, at Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport, but that claim has never been proven. Snell further claimed that one of the Arkansas state troopers who were assigned to the Governor's security team at that time had beaten Snell's wife in an attempt to force her to reveal the location of the alleged video footage Snell had taken at the airport. In 1983, Snell, accompanied by CSA members William Thomas and Steven Scott, attempted to dynamite a natural gas pipeline near Fulton, Arkansas, without success. Scott was eventually captured and convicted of that crime, while several other CSA members were arrested on various other charges, mostly weapons violations. By 1985, the CSA had essentially fallen into inactivity due to most of its members being either killed or incarcerated.  Murders and execution  Snell, known to his friends as \\"Wayne\\", was an anomaly amongst the militants of the CSA, in that he operated autonomously, using the CSA compound as his base of operation. Steven Scott, a frequent collaborator with Snell, gave this information in a federal prison holding cell to one of the then members. On November 3, 1983, Snell shot and killed pawn shop owner William Stumpp, who he mistakenly believed was of Jewish descent, and then on June 30, 1984, he killed black Arkansas State Trooper Louis P. Bryant near DeQueen, Arkansas.Trooper Louis P. Bryant . The Officer Down Memorial, Inc.. Retrieved on 2007-11-15. Snell then left the scene and drove across the Oklahoma state line, however a truck driver who witnessed the killing of Officer Bryant followed him, and contacted the Broken Bow police department. The police officers there set up a roadblock, where they engaged Snell in a shootout which resulted in Snell being wounded six times in the abdomen, knee and ankle and arrested. Snell was then returned to Arkansas for trial, where he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Bryant and death for the murder of Stumpp. Snell never denied the allegations made against him, or the crimes he was accused of having committed. The Cummins Unit, where Snell was executed Snell was held at the Tucker Maximum Security Unit until April 15, 1995, when he was transferred to the execution site.\\"Murderer Moved to Death Watch Cell\\" ().

Mr. Snell was taken to the execution site here on Monday by National Guard helicopter before dawn.\\" = Oklahoma City bombing = He was executed on the same day that Timothy McVeigh carried out the Oklahoma City bombing, which destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Snell had been accused of plotting to bomb the Murrah Building in the 1980s. Snell reportedly watched televised reports of the Oklahoma City bombing on the day of his execution and nodded in approval. One theory holds that Timothy McVeigh committed his bombing in retaliation for Snell's execution. However, McVeigh said that his primary motivation for the bombing was retaliation against the government for its Waco Siege that took place exactly two years prior on April 19, 1993 and the government's handling of the Ruby Ridge crisis. McVeigh never testified as to why he chose the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.

This book is a detailed examination of causal conditioning, the law of cause and effect, analyzing 24 types of conditional relations (paccaya) in relation to the classifications in the matika of the Dhammasangani. Most causes can be classified as more than one types. 24 conditional relations # root or primitive causes (hetu paccaya) Lobha (attachment), Alobha (anti-attachment), Dosa (aggressiveness), Adosa (anti-aggressiveness or embrace), Moha (ignorance) and Amoha (wisdom), by being the six root or primitive causes, give rise to all thoughts and feelings. #stimulative causes (arammana paccaya) External objects and their effects, such as light and sounds, are ones of the causes of thoughts and feelings by stimulating a person's sensations. # dominant causes (adhipati paccaya) A few mental aspects, such as wish (Chanda) and motivation (Vƒ´rya), are believed to be possible dominant causes in Buddhist Psychology because each of them can profoundly dominate the rest of the mental aspects at one time. #subsequent causes (anantara paccayo) Each step or process of a vithi, a mental procedure in Buddhist Psychology, happens in order. One of such steps is a subsequent causes that give rise to a following one. #continuous causes (samanantara paccayo) This point is sort of emphasis of the continuity between two successive steps of a vithi. # Simultaneous or unitary causes (sahajata paccaya) The pali word saha means \\"together\\" and jata means \\"rise (into existence).\\" Interpretations of this point can be in two main versions. In the more straightforward one, the causes that rise together and give rise to particular effects together are simultaneous causes. In the broader sense, according to Abhiddhamma, all the variety of physical or mental features are mere manifestations of a number of fundamental physical or mental principles, and hence all of the variety can be unified to a simple group just like the fundamental forces can be unified in electroweak interaction and grand unified theory. #inter-supportive causes (a√±√±ama√±√±a paccaya) In Abhidhamma, some mental and physical phenomena are inter-supportive causes that can give rise to one another. The relationship of the change of a magnetic flux and that of an electric field could be a good example for this. #responsible causes (nissaya paccaya) If one or more processes or phenomena is attributed to a particular cause no matter whether the causality is direct or indirect, that cause is, in Abhidhamma, regarded as a responsible cause. #super-responsible causes (upa- nissaya paccaya) #pre-existing causes (purejƒÅta paccaya) A cause that has risen into its existence before an effect that it gives rise to, it is a pre-existing cause. #post-existing causes (pacchƒÅjƒÅ paccaya) A cause that rises into its existence after a phenomenon that it later supports or maintains, it is a post-existing cause. #habitual cultivation (ƒÅsevana paccaya) #karma causes (kamma paccaya) In Theravada Buddhism, the correct meaning of kamma or karma is basically the same as agency in humanism, a purposeful action. If a particular process or phenomena of a person is purposeful enough to cause a consequence (vipƒÅka), it is called a karma causes. #consequence causes (vipƒÅka paccaya) #nutritious causes (ƒÅhƒÅra paccaya) Nutrition that serves as fuel or raw material in physiology is nutritious causes. #controlling faculty (indriya paccaya) #jhƒÅna ‚Äì a relation specific to meditation attainments (jhƒÅna paccaya) #path ‚Äì a relation specific to the stages on the Buddhist path (magga paccaya) #association (sampayutta paccaya) #dissociation (vippayutta paccaya) #presence (atthi paccaya) #absence (natthi paccaya) #disappearance (vigata paccaya) #non-disappearance (a-vigata paccaya) English translations *Conditional Relations, 1969-, in progress, 2 volumes so far tr U Narada, Pali Text Society, Bristol References  External links  * 'Patthana Dhamma' HTML E-book by Htoo Naing. * 'www.patthana.net' Canonical text of Patthana both in English and Pali, guides, lectures, and other materials.

Based on a design by architect Feliks Ksiƒô≈ºarski to match the oldest building of the University, it was opened for the 500th anniversary of the University's foundation. The Collegium Novum replaced a former academic boarding school called Jeruzalem, consumed by fire in the mid-19th century. The building contains lecture rooms including an impressive assembly hall (called Aula), Rector's, Deans', and other university authorities' offices as well as those of a number of prominent professors. It is the Jagiellonian University's administrative centre. Collegium Novum was opened on June 14, 1887, commencing several years of debate and construction. The decision regarding the allocation of subsidies was made in the Austro-Hungarian capital of Vienna, with the University's vital interests defended by Julian Dunajewski, the then Austrian Finance Minister. The work might not have begun at all had it not been for his commitment, as well as that of his brother Cardinal Albin Dunajewski. Collegium Novum assembly hall Already at the time of its grand opening, the assembly hall (Aula) of the new building was too small to accommodate all guests on all occasions, even though the number of students did not exceed 1200 with approximately one hundred professors. A debate arose whether it was necessary to invite professors' wives to grand ceremonies. Most academics, in keeping with the prevailing trend of the time, were against the inviting of women guests. In the University's archives there is a formal invitation reading: ‚ÄúZoll requires no ticket and wishes the ceremony to be exclusively male.‚Äù In another statement, Edward Janczewski ‚Äúexpresses his opposition to the idea of admitting ladies to the ceremonies.‚Äù Professor Andrzej Chwalba, \\"From the Collegium Maius to the Auditorium Maximum\\", lecture, Jagiellonian University, October 1, 2005 Until the end of First World War, a portrait of emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, painted by Kazimierz Pochwalski, hung in the Aula of the Collegium. On October 31, 1918 a group of University students tore it to pieces, manifesting their determination for the recreation of an independent Republic of Poland. However, a number of other paintings did survive, including portraits of the University's founding fathers Casimir the Great and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço dating back to the early 1860s, a picture of Queen Jadwiga painted in 1900 to celebrate her Jubilee, as well as the works of Jan Matejko, including his painting entitled Copernicus: Conversation with God. The chairs in the assembly hall were designed by Tadeusz Stryje≈Ñski. On the upper floor of the College there is a lecture hall named after J√≥zef Szujski - now used by historians - with the commemorative plaque in remembrance of the events surrounding Nazi German action called Sonderaktion Krakau where 183 professors were arrested and later sent to camps in Sachsenhausen and Dachau. The plaque reads: \\"For the freedom of spirit and service to science and nation of Jagiellonian University professors deceitfully and forcefully taken away from this hall and imprisoned by the Nazi occupant on November 6, 1939.\\" The restoration of the Neo-Gothic architectural structure took place at the end of the 20th century. It was faced with a number of challenges, notably the task of reviving the original form of the building while simultaneously improving its functionality as an educational facility. The restoration was carried out on its fa√ßade in 1994 along with the modernization of the assembly hall, which was completed in 1999. The collaboration of specialists from various disciplines allowed for both restoration and functional needs of the Collegium to be met successfully.

Secretive of his business he soon arouses suspicion especially when his identity is revealed as the infamous, troublemaking 'Southern Fist' fighter Pai Yu Ching. Tan Tao Liang plays 'Northern Leg' Captain Lu, the towns 'sheriff' who finds himself in deep water when the mayor's son murders his (Capt Lu's) mother-in-law. Lu is steadfast in his resolve to catch the killer but has many obstacles put in his way, particularly Ms. Li (Suen Ga Lam); the sister of an ex-sheriff who Lu accidentally killed and wants revenge, and the mayor, who hires Pai Yu Ching to protect his house from any would-be lawmen that might try to arrest his son. The mayor has other reasons for keeping Lu at arm's length as he is deeply involved in a counterfeiting ring. Pai Yu Ching is actually a secret government official, who in the beginning is often in staring contests with Capt Lu but eventually seeks Lu's help after his partner is killed by the hotels owner (who is secretly in cahoots with the Mayor). When matters get out of hand the mayor calls on his partner, the strange Mr Lung (Tommy Lee), for help. Mr Lung is a kind of golden haired, white faced gorilla-like creature that speaks in an echoed voice and walks with a limp. He is, however, extremely competent at mantis kung fu. Mr. Lung eventually helps the mayor capture Capt Lu and Pai Yu Ching after they find the seal that makes counterfeit money.

The constitution guarantees religious liberty, although Christians are not allowed to witness publicly, and are subject to the denial of many civil rights, putting them at a societal disadvantage. There are foreign religious groups that take part in humanitarian action in the Comoros. They do not engage in proselytizing there, however. Religious groups do not have a duty to register.

Career  In his playing career, Brittain played for Zillmere Eagles in the Queensland State League. He eventually suffered a back injury which ended his career. Brittain took up coaching, and was an assistant coach at the Carlton Football Club under David Parkin. Brittain was credited with much of the club's success in the 2000 home and away season. Following Parkin's retirement at the end of 2000, Brittain became the senior coach of Carlton, serving in the role from 2001 until 2002. He took the club to fifth place in 2001, but crashed to last place in 2002, the first time Carlton had ever won the VFL/AFL wooden spoon. He was sacked at the end of the year and replaced by Denis Pagan.

It was added to the monarchy titles by the king Henry IV of Castile, upon the addition of Gibraltar to the Crown patrimony in 1462.. As from 1713 the title passed to the Crown of Great Britain. Many titles belonging to territories that are no longer under the sovereignty of the Spanish Monarchy (such as Sardinia, Two Sicilies or the West and East Indies), the title of \\"King of Gibraltar\\" is no longer kept in the titles and honours of the Spanish Crown and is not among the titles of the present king, Felipe VI,Royal Styles: Spain as the town Gibraltar was ceded to the British Crown under Article X of the Treaty of Utrecht 1713. History During the Middle Ages, Gibraltar was part of the Moorish Taifa of M√°laga in Al-Andalus. It was ruled by Abdul Malik, son of the Marinid dynasty, between 1333 and 1340. After an unsuccessful siege led by Alfonso XI of Castile during the Reconquista period, Emir Isa Ibn al-Hassam proclaimed himself \\"King of Gibraltar and its lands\\" in 1355. The kingship remained in Muslim hands for the next century. Gibraltar was finally captured by Castile on 15 December 1462 when it fell to an army led by the Duke of Medina Sidonia, who expelled the Moors from the territory. King Henry IV of Castile, the brother of the later Queen Isabella I of Castile, rewarded the duke with the title of Marquess of Gibraltar and added the kingship of Gibraltar to the list of titles of the Castilian crown. The title can no longer be used by his successors as the territory was ceded to the Crown of Great Britain in perpetuity under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713.Juridical Facts as Sources of International Rights and Obligations, vol. 6 in International law in historical perspective, J.

This title is not \\"pertaining to the crown\\" of Spain. The Spanish Constitution has no competence to authorise the use of foreign titles belonging to other Monarchs.

History The castle was built in 1631, although its origins are believed to go back a further three hundred years. It originally served as the seat of the Earls of Kinnoull, and stood within a walled enclosure containing subsidiary buildings, orchards etc., on a terrace overlooking the North Inch. After falling into neglect in the early 19th century, the Castle was 'restored' (in fact, virtually rebuilt), and extensively remodelled on a larger scale between 1862 and 1864 in the Scottish Baronial style by the architect David Smart. No original features survive except for parts of the original rubble walls on the east side. The Regimental Trustees of the Black Watch bought Balhousie Castle in January 2009 and it became the Regimental Headquarters and Museum of the regiment. The museum displays the history of the regiment from 1739 to the present. The Black Watch Heritage Appeal was launched in September 2009 allowing the regiment to raise in excess of ¬£3.2 million to develop Balhousie Castle to provide a permanent home for the museum and archive of The Black Watch.

Usually, the employee's supervisor (and frequently, a more senior manager) is responsible for evaluating the employee. A private conference is often scheduled to discuss the evaluation. The process of an evaluation may include one or more of these things: * An assessment on how well the employee is doing. Sometimes, this may include a scale rating indicating strengths and weaknesses in key areas (e.g., following instructions, promptness, and ability to get along with others). Often, the supervisor and manager will discuss the key areas. Or, as some have dared to expose, employers often time don't care about following instructions, arriving on time, or the ability to get along with others. Michael Lewis (author), non- fictional author, once wrote about working at a financial institution: \\"The bosses rightly cared far more about how much money we squeezed from our customers than how much time we spent squeezing.\\" * Employee goals that are expected to be met (or have significant progress made) by a set time, such as the next evaluation. Sometimes, the employee may voluntarily offer a goal, while other times it will be set by his boss. A significantly underperforming employee may be given a performance improvement plan, which details specific goals that must be met to maintain their job. * Sharing of feedback by a worker's fellow employees and supervisors. The employee is given his chance to share their feelings, concerns and suggestions about the workplace as well. * Details about workplace standing, promotions and pay raises. Sometimes, an employee who has performed very well since his last review period may get an increase in pay or be promoted to a more prestigious position. However, a pay raise that is denied is not always the result of a poor review, as economic conditions and other factors dictate the ability for employers to raise their workers' pay. The frequency of an evaluation, and policies concerning them, varies widely from workplace to workplace. Sometimes, an evaluation will be given to a new employee after a probationary period lapses, after which they may be conducted on a regular basis (such as every year). According to the 2014 Performance Management survey, 96% of employers perform annual performance evaluations and 44% of employers perform a 90-day performance review for new employees.2014 Performance Management Survey http://performancereviews.net/survey/ References External links *Sample Employee Evaluation Form *Self-assessment Form - anonymous and free *Employee Assessments: Organisational Value and Purpose (A Focalworks article) *Realistic job preview Evaluation Category:Workplace ","title":"Evaluation (workplace)"},{"id":"10777559","text":"Galvannealed or galvanneal (galvannealed steel) is the result from the processes of galvanizing followed by annealing of sheet steel. Galvannealed steel is a matte uniform grey color, which can be easily painted. In comparison to galvanized steel the coating is harder, and more brittle. Production and properties Production of galvannealed sheet steel begins with hot dip galvanization of sheet steel. After passing through the galvanizing zinc bath the sheet steel passes through air knives to remove excess zinc, and is then heated in an annealing furnace for several seconds causing iron and zinc layers to diffuse into one another causing the formation of zinc-iron alloy layers at the surface. The annealing step is performed with the strip still hot after the galvanizing step, with the zinc still liquid. The galvanising bath contains slightly over 0.1% aluminium, added to form a layer bonding between the iron and coated zinc. Annealing temperatures are around 500 to 565 ¬∞C. Pre-1990 annealing lines used gas-fired heating; post-1990s the use of induction furnaces became common. Three distinct alloys are identified in the galvannealed surface. From the steel boundary these are named the Gamma (Œì), Zeta (Œ∂), and Delta (Œ¥) layers, of compositions Fe3Zn10, FeZn10, FeZn13 respectively; resulting in an overall bulk iron content of 9-12%. The layers also contain around 1-4% aluminium. Composition depends primarily on heating time and temperature, limited by the diffusion of the two metals. The resulting coating has a matte appearance, and is hard and brittle - under further working such as pressing or bending powder is produced from degradation of the coating, together with cracks on the surface. In comparison to a zinc (galvanized) coating galvannealed has better spot weldability, and is paintable, Due to iron present in the surface alloy phase galvanneal develops a reddish patina in moist environments - it is generally used painted. Zinc phosphate coating is a common pre-painting surface treatment. Galvannealed sheet can also be produced from electroplated zinc steel sheet. History Patents relating to Galvannealed wire were obtained by the Keystone Steel and Wire Company (Peoria, Illinois, USA) c. 1923. The company used the name \\"Galvannealed\\" as a brand name. They key early patent was US patent No. 1430648 (J.L. Herman, 1922, Peoria, Illinois, USA) \\"Process of coating and treating materials having an iron base\\". The patent described the galvannealing process with specific reference to iron wires. Uses A major market for galvannealed steel is the automobile industry. In the 1990s galvannealled coatings were used by Honda, Toyota and Ford, with hot dip galvanized, electrogalvanized and other coatings (e.g. Zn-Ni) being used by other manufacturers, with variations depending on the part within the car frame, as well as due to local price differences. Galvannealed Steel is the preferred material for use in the construction of permanent debris and linen chute systems.

He is based on famed American journalist Lowell Thomas.  Overview  Bentley first appears at the funeral of T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) in 1935. Asked for his opinion about Lawrence by a reporter, he remarks: :It was my privilege to know him, and to make him known to the world. He was a poet, a scholar, and a mighty warrior. Then, after the reporter exits, he says to a friend: :He was also the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey. He is then accosted by a British Medical Officer (Howard Marion-Crawford) who protests angrily that Lawrence was \\"a very great man.\\" Bentley does not appear in the story proper until the beginning of Act II, when he arrives at Arab- and British-occupied Aqaba to interview Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), writing for the Chicago Courier. He admits that he is \\"looking for a hero\\" to inspire his country's entry into World War I, to which Feisal replies: :Lawrence is your man. Bentley covers one of Lawrence's train raids, interviewing Lawrence, Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif), and photographing the event - though Auda ibu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) takes offense, smashing one of his cameras. Bentley re-appears as Lawrence returns to Jerusalem, but is prevented from speaking with Lawrence by Dryden (Claude Rains). He protests that he has a right to see Lawrence due to his role in his fame. Dryden rebuffs him: :It's a little clash of temperament that's going on there. Inevitably, one of them's half-mad, and the other - wholly unscrupulous. Bentley arrives to accompany Lawrence's final campaign against Damascus, but the car he has rented breaks down and he is forced to accompany the main British column with General Allenby (Jack Hawkins). He arrives in the aftermath of the Tafas massacre, appalled at the carnage he sees, and addresses a blood-soaked, remorseful Lawrence: :Oh, you rotten man. Let me take your rotten bloody picture. . . for the rotten, bloody newspapers! Bentley is in his forties, highly cynical of authority, and regards the ambitions of Lawrence, Ali, and Feisal cynically. He and Lawrence seem to have a somewhat antagonistic relationship, but find each other useful for their respective ends. He has published a very well written novel titled \\"48 hours - A City of London Thriller\\"  Inspiration  Bentley is obviously inspired by American journalist and explorer Lowell Thomas. Thomas, along with cameraman Harry Chase, briefly accompanied Lawrence on his exploits in the Arab Revolt, visited the archaeological site at Petra, and also spent time with Lawrence, Allenby, and Feisal in Aqaba and Jerusalem (though unlike Bentley, he never met Auda and spent no time on the front lines). After the war (not during it, as the film depicts), he helped make Lawrence a household name with a book and dramatic slide lectures which toured London and New York City. (His being based in Chicago, and his name being Jackson, Thomas's middle name, are other give-aways.) However, Bentley is a middle-aged man, whereas Thomas was in his twenties during the war. There is also no equivalent to Chase in the film. Lawrence and Thomas in real life had a friendly relationship that only turned sour after Thomas refused to stop his slide lectures in the early 20s, despite personal requests by Lawrence. Thomas seemed to hold Lawrence in high regard, unlike Bentley, though he famously described Lawrence: :He had a genius of backing into the limelight. Thomas had approached the film's producer, Sam Spiegel, with a great deal of research material, which was turned down. Thomas enjoyed the film on its own merits, but felt it was a grossly inaccurate depiction of Lawrence and the Arab Revolt. Michael Wilson's original script was based on With Lawrence in Arabia, Thomas's book on the Arab Revolt, and Thomas served as the film's narrator. Robert Bolt's revision focused on Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom as its primary source; Thomas's character was scaled down, and his name changed.

It was originally an anti-racist/anti-fascist paper published by Anti-Fascist Committees in Greater London, later it appeared as a section within the anti-Fascist Searchlight magazine, and later still it split with Searchlight to publish as an independent magazine for some years before closing down in 2003. The CARF editorial collective was always closely associated with the IRR (Institute of Race Relations) and the CARF group now operates as a support group for the IRR's news output.  History  The journal CARF was first published in late 1976 by the Richmond & Twickenham Anti Racist Committee. In 1977 it was adopted as the paper of the (London) Anti-Racist, Anti-Fascist Co-ordinating Committee (ARAFCC) - a federation of the broad-based anti-fascist committees that had sprung up across Greater London in response to the growth of the National Front and its Strasserite offshoot, the National Party. ARAFCC and CARF were also associated with the Institute of Race Relations. When ARAFCC wound down in 1979 CARF continued to publish under an agreement with the then editor of Searchlight, Maurice Ludmer, with whom they had generally good relations, and CARF appeared for several years as a separately edited section within Searchlight. This arrangement continued after the untimely death of Ludmer in 1981, but was put under some strain by the perception that Searchlight maintained too close a relationship with pro-Zionist groups (Zionism being regarded as a racist ideology by some leftist and anti-racist groups and organisations in the UK). This strain came to a head in 1991 when Searchlight editor (and one of its original founders) Gerry Gable was accused of excluding leading Asian anti-racists from a public platform and when he published an article promoting the openly pro-Israeli/pro-Zionist Jewish Action Group in the pages of Searchlight. The CARF editorial group decided to end their relationship with Searchlight, and CARF went back to being an independent magazine with an editorial collective based largely on members and supporters of the IRR. By this time the activists from the London Anti-Fascist Committees who had founded CARF in the 1970s were no longer prominent and CARF had therefore lost most of its connections with local working-class and Labour Movement bodies (e.g. with local trades councils that had established or sponsored most of the London Anti-Fascist Committees). CARF published until 2003, when it was decided that the magazine was no longer viable and it effectively became a support group for the IRR's own publishing and promotional efforts.

Equality occurs if and only if the triangle is equilateral. Pedoe's inequality is a generalization of Weitzenb√∂ck's inequality. The Hadwiger-Finsler inequality is a strengthened version of Weitzenb√∂ck's inequality. Geometric interpretation and proof Rewriting the inequality above allows for a more concrete geometric interpretation, which in turn provides an immediate proof.Claudi Alsina, Roger B. Nelsen: Geometric Proofs of the Weitzenb√∂ck and Hadwiger-Finsler Inequalities. Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 81, No. 3 (Jun., 2008), pp. 216‚Äì219 (JSTOR) : \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{4}b^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{4}c^2 \\\\geq 3\\\\, \\\\Delta . Now the summands on the left side are the areas of equilateral triangles erected over the sides of the original triangle and hence the inequation states that the sum of areas of the equilateral triangles is always greater than or equal to threefold the area of the original triangle. : \\\\Delta_a + \\\\Delta_b + \\\\Delta_c \\\\geq 3\\\\, \\\\Delta . This can now can be shown by replicating area of the triangle three times within the equilateral triangles. To achieve that the Fermat point is used to partition the triangle into three obtuse subtriangles with a 120^\\\\circ angle and each of those subtriangles is replicated three times within the equilateral triangle next to it. This only works if every angle of the triangle is smaller than 120^\\\\circ, since otherwise the Fermat point is not located in the interior of the triangle and becomes a vertex instead. However if one angle is greater or equal to 120^\\\\circ it is possible to replicate the whole triangle three times within the largest equilateral triangle, so the sum of areas of all equilateral triangles stays greater than the threefold area of the triangle anyhow.  Further proofs  The proof of this inequality was set as a question in the International Mathematical Olympiad of 1961. Even so, the result is not too difficult to derive using Heron's formula for the area of a triangle: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta & {} =\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\sqrt{(a+b+c)(a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b)}  & {} =\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\sqrt{2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)-(a^4+b^4+c^4)}. \\\\end{align} = First method = It can be shown that the area of the inner Napoleon's triangle, which must be nonnegative, isCoxeter, H.S.M., and Greitzer, Samuel L. Geometry Revisited, page 64. :\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{24}(a^2+b^2+c^2-4\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\Delta), so the expression in parentheses must be greater than or equal to 0. = Second method = This method assumes no knowledge of inequalities except that all squares are nonnegative. : \\\\begin{align} {} & (a^2 - b^2)^2 + (b^2 - c^2)^2 + (c^2 - a^2)^2 \\\\geq 0  {} \\\\iff & 2(a^4+b^4+c^4) - 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2) \\\\geq 0  {} \\\\iff & \\\\frac{4(a^4+b^4+c^4)}{3} \\\\geq \\\\frac{4(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)}{3}  {} \\\\iff & \\\\frac{(a^4+b^4+c^4) + 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)}{3} \\\\geq 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)-(a^4+b^4+c^4)  {} \\\\iff & \\\\frac{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2}{3} \\\\geq (4\\\\Delta)^2, \\\\end{align} and the result follows immediately by taking the positive square root of both sides. From the first inequality we can also see that equality occurs only when a = b = c and the triangle is equilateral. =Third method= This proof assumes knowledge of the AM‚ÄìGM inequality. : \\\\begin{align} & & (a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2 & \\\\geq & & 0  \\\\Rightarrow & & 2a^2+2b^2+2c^2 & \\\\geq & & 2ab+2bc+2ac  \\\\iff & & 3(a^2+b^2+c^2) & \\\\geq & & (a + b + c)^2  \\\\iff & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\\\geq & & \\\\sqrt{3(a+b+c)\\\\left(\\\\frac{a+b+c}{3}\\\\right)^3}  \\\\Rightarrow & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\\\geq & & \\\\sqrt{3 (a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)}  \\\\iff & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\\\geq & & 4 \\\\sqrt3 \\\\Delta. \\\\end{align} As we have used the arithmetic- geometric mean inequality, equality only occurs when a = b = c and the triangle is equilateral. =Fourth method= Write x=\\\\cot A, c=\\\\cot A+\\\\cot B>0 so the sum S=\\\\cot A+\\\\cot B+\\\\cot C=c+\\\\frac{1-x(c-x)}{c} and cS=c^2-xc+x^2+1=\\\\left(x-\\\\frac{c}{2}\\\\right)^2+\\\\left(\\\\frac{c\\\\sqrt{3}}{2}-1\\\\right)^2+c\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\ge c\\\\sqrt{3} i.e. S\\\\ge\\\\sqrt{3}.

He is the husband of the Queen of Hearts. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland When compared to the Queen of Hearts, the King of Hearts appears to be the moderate part of the Wonderland government. As an example, when the Queen, who enjoys ordering beheadings, attempts to have Alice executed (charged with being unable to answer who is lying down in front of her), the King of Hearts reminds her that she is only a child. The King also quietly pardons many of the subjects the Queen has ordered to be beheaded when the Queen is not looking. This guarantees few people are actually beheaded. Nevertheless, when the Queen plays a game of croquet in the story, the only players who remain at the end are himself, the Queen, and Alice. At the Knave of Hearts' trial, however, where he acts as judge, he is revealed to be quite juvenile, with such lines as, \\"don't be nervous or I'll have you executed on the spot\\" to the Mad Hatter, or asking the Duchess' cook irrelevant questions such as \\"what are tarts made of?\\" Between the two of them, the King and Queen appear to present a fairly accurate reflection of the childish, reckless, and confusing world of Wonderland. Disney version The Disney movie portrays the King of Hearts as a dwarfish man wearing an extremely tall crown, and he is very much subdued by the Queen in terms of popularity among their subjects. He seems to be less bright than in the book: for instance when he first sees Alice, he thinks she is another card. He also squeals happily behind the subject being ordered to be beheaded, once the Queen gives the order, taunting the Card guards that are carrying away the failed Card Soldier as if he had given the order himself. He appears briefly when the Cheshire Cat entangles the Queen's croquet mallet (actually a live flamingo) in her dress, causing her to fall over and expose her red heart- printed panties. The King then gives the order to save her modesty, which he and nearly all the Card Soldiers do with the sole exception of Alice. This causes the Queen to blame Alice for the embarrassing situation. Just as she orders Alice's head off, the King of Hearts requests a trial beforehand. This irritates the Queen, prompting the King to add that it will only be \\"a little trial\\". The Queen accepts. However, when the trial begins she offers an atypical approach towards justice: sentence before verdict (the same stance taken by her original portrayal in the book with regard to the Knave of Hearts). The King again stops her, saying they should call witnesses first. The witnesses called are the Mad Hatter, March Hare, and Dormouse. The Cheshire Cat reappears and frightens the Dormouse, who briefly puts the court into disorder. The Queen of Hearts again blames Alice for it, and orders her beheaded. At this, Alice eats mushrooms she had earlier procured, which make her grow bigger. Although the King announces rule #42 which says that \\"all persons more than a mile high must leave the court immediately\\", Alice feels free to call the Queen a \\"fat, pompous, bad-tempered old tyrant\\" while growing to her new size. The Queen gives the order a third time. As Alice flees, the King uses his oversized crown as a megaphone to tell the guards to \\"do as her Majesty says\\". When Alice returns to normal size and the Cheshire Cat mentions the insult again enough for the Queen of Hearts to quote \\"Off With her Head,\\" the King of Hearts partakes in the chase on Alice amongst the Queen of Hearts, the Card Soldiers, and the other Wonderland characters. This ends when Alice wakes up. He was voiced by Dink Trout in the 1951 film and by Tony Pope in the Disneyland attraction. Other versions * In the 1933 film Alice in Wonderland, he was portrayed by Ford Sterling. * The 2009 TV miniseries Alice presents the King of Hearts, here named Winston Heart, as an unhappy character married to Mary Elizabeth Constance De Villiers Heart, the Queen of Wonderland. Although he loves her dearly, she cares only for power. As in other versions, Winston finds ways of mitigating the lethality of his wife's orders. * In the ABC TV drama Once Upon a Time, the closest analog to the King of Hearts is the character of Henry (portrayed by Tony Perez), the footman and father of the Evil Queen, in that his wife, Cora (the miller's daughter from Rumpelstiltskin), becomes the Queen of Hearts after being exiled to Wonderland. * The anime and manga series Pandora Hearts has Arthur Barma, the brother of Miranda Barma/Demios who was based on the Queen of Hearts.

It provides numerous services for the mostly immigrant population of the neighborhood and has since 1886, when it was established as the first settlement house in the United States. History Federal Art Project poster for an exhibition of art at the University Settlement (1937) University Settlement was founded by Stanton Coit and Charles Bunstein Stover in 1886 as The Neighborhood Guild, in a basement on Forsyth Street. Historically the settlement house, much like other settlement houses like Hull House (in Chicago, Illinois) and the Henry Street Settlement (also on the Lower East Side), served as a homes for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th century. They provided courses for new immigrants on everything from politics to the English language to basketball. The University Settlement House also included a library, kindergarten and the first public baths. These settlements were also loci of Progressive Era reform. When founded, the resident workers at the University Settlement were all male and recent graduates of colleges. Several of these men were writers in addition to settlement house workers and used their writing as social protest and a means of reform. Residents between 1900 and 1907 included socialist writer William English Walling, a founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Pulitzer Prize- winner Ernest Poole; Howard Brubaker, who later became a columnist for The New Yorker; writer Arthur Bullard; journalist Hamilton Holt; and author Walter Weyl, a founding editor of The New Republic. Their interest in reform led to several articles and books on the housing and employment situation of workers on the Lower East Side, particularly women and children. One issue that captured the imagination of many of the University Settlement writers was revolution in Russia. Many of the immigrants they met on the Lower East Side were Jews from the Russian empire who were typically severely repressed under Nicholas II of Russia. Through their interaction with these immigrants several of the residents became vocal advocates of reform in Russia. During 1905 and 1906, Poole, Walling and Bullard traveled to Russia to cover the abortive 1905 Russian Revolution. They established contacts and helped establish a connection between radical writers in the U.S. and Russian revolutionaries. During his administration, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt described University Settlement as \\"a landmark in the social history of the nation.\\"Legacy of Light, 1986.

Its origins in the United States date back to the Mexican and American independence wars, and the struggle over the disputed Southwestern territories that once belonged to Spain through the establishment of Catholic missions. This eventually would lead to the war between the two nations and the defeat of Mexico, which came with a great loss of territory. In the 20th century, anti-Mexican sentiment continued to grow after the Zimmermann Telegram incident between the Mexican government during the Mexican Revolution and the German Empire during World War I. Background Throughout U.S. history, negative stereotypes have circulated regarding Mexican AmericansFlores Niemann Yolanda, et al.

In complete disregard of her identity, she came to be known as \\"Juanita\\" after her death, a stereotypical name for a Mexican woman. As the result of the Texas Revolution and Texas annexation, the United States inherited the Republic of Texas's border disputes with Mexico, which led to the eruption of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì48). After the United States' victory over Mexico, Mexico signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. This treaty required that Mexico cede more than half its land to the United States in exchange for 15 million dollars, but also guaranteed that Mexican citizens living in ceded lands would retain full property rights and would be granted United States citizenship if they remained in the ceded lands for at least one year.Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Article 8 This treaty and others led to the establishment in 1889 of the International Boundary and Water Commission, which was tasked with maintenance of the border, allocation of river waters between the two nations, and provision for flood control and water sanitation.Robert J.

Rev. 197(Spring 2011) (also available for free download at Robert John McCarthy (15 May 2011). Executive Authority, Adaptive Treaty Interpretation, and the International Boundary and Water Commission, U.S.‚ÄìMexico) The lynching of Mexicans and Mexican US-Americans in the Southwest has long been overlooked in American history. This may be because the Tuskegee Institute files and reports, which contain the United States' most comprehensive lynching records, categorized Mexican, Chinese, and Native American lynching victims as white.Carrigan, William D. and Clive Web. \\"The lynching of persons of Mexican origin or descent in the United States, 1848 to 1928\\" The Journal of Social History 37:2 (Winter 2003): 413. Statistics of reported lynching in the United States indicate that, between 1882 and 1951, 4,730 persons were lynched, of whom 1,293 were white and 3,437 were black.\\"lynching.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. December 22, 2009. Lynching MOB VIOLENCE. The actual number of Mexicans lynched is unknown. William D. Carrigan and Clive Webb estimate that between 1848 and 1928 at least 597 Mexicans were lynched, of which 64 were lynched in areas which lacked a formal judicial system. During the California Gold Rush, as many as 25,000 Mexicans arrived in California. Many of these Mexicans were experienced miners and had great success mining gold in California. Some Anglos perceived their success as a collective loss to U.S. wealth and intimidated Mexican miners with violence. Between 1848 and 1860, at least 163 Mexicans were lynched in California alone. One particularly infamous lynching occurred on July 5, 1851, when a Mexican woman named Josefa Segovia was lynched by a mob in Downieville, California. She was accused of killing a man who had attempted to assault her after breaking into her home. 1900s to 1920s The Bisbee Deportation was the illegal deportation of about 1,300 striking mine workers, their supporters, and citizen bystanders by 2,000 vigilantes on July 12, 1917. The workers and others were kidnapped in the U.S. town of Bisbee, Arizona, and held at a local baseball park. They were then loaded onto cattle cars and transported 200 miles (320 km) for 16 hours through the desert without food or water. The deportees were unloaded at Hermanas, New Mexico, without money or transportation, and warned not to return to Bisbee. In 1911, a mob of over 100 people hanged a 14-year-old boy, Antonio G√≥mez, after he was arrested for murder. Rather than let him serve time in jail, townspeople lynched him and dragged his body through the streets of Thorndale, Texas. Between 1910 and 1919, Texas Rangers were responsible for the deaths of hundreds to thousands of ethnic Mexicans in South Texas. The violence continued through the Porvenir Massacre on January 28, 1918, when Texas Rangers summarily executed fifteen Mexicans in Presidio County, Texas. This caused State Representative Jos√© Canales to head an investigation into systematic violence against Mexicans by the Texas Rangers, largely ending the pattern of violence and leading to the dismissal of five rangers involved in the massacre. 1930s The Mexican American community has been the subject of widespread immigration raids. During the Great Depression, the United States government sponsored a Mexican Repatriation program, which was intended to pressure people to move to Mexico, but many were deported against their will. More than 500,000 individuals were deported; one source estimates that approximately 60 percent of these were United States citizens.1930s Mexican Deportation: Educator brings attention to historic period and its effect on her family Mexican Repatriation in 1930s is Little Known Story Chapter Fifteen In 1936, Colorado even ordered all of its \\"Mexicans\\"‚Äîin reality, anyone who spoke Spanish or seemed to be of Latin descent‚Äîto leave the state and blockaded its southern border to keep people from leaving. Though no formal decree was ever issued by immigration authorities, Immigration and Naturalization Service officials deported. Both the state of California and the city of Los Angeles apologized for repatriation in the early 2000s. 1940s The Zoot Suit Riots were a series of racial attacks in June 1943 in Los Angeles, California, between Mexican American youths and European-American servicemen stationed in Southern California. According to the National World War II Museum, between 250,000 and 500,000 Hispanic Americans served in the United States Armed Forces during World War II comprising 2.3% to 4.7% of the Army. The exact number, however, is unknown as at the time Hispanics were classified as whites. Generally, Mexican American World War II servicemen were integrated into regular military units. However, many Mexican‚ÄìAmerican war veterans were discriminated against and even denied medical services by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs when they arrived home.press3b In 1948, war veteran Dr Hector P. Garcia founded the American GI Forum (AGIF) to address the concerns of Mexican American veterans who were being discriminated against. The AGIF's first campaign was on the behalf of Felix Longoria, a Mexican American private who was killed in the Philippines in the line of duty. Upon the return of his body to his hometown of Three Rivers, Texas, he was denied funeral services because he was Mexican American. In the 1940s, imagery in newspapers and crime novels portrayed Mexican American zoot suiters as disloyal foreigners or murderers attacking non-Hispanic White police officers and servicemen. Anti-zoot suiter sentiment sparked a series of attacks on young Mexican American males in Los Angeles, which became known as the Zoot Suit Riots. The worst of the rioting occurred on June 9, 1943, during which 5,000 servicemen and residents gathered in downtown Los Angeles and attacked Mexican American zoot suiters and non- zoot suiters alike. The rioting eventually spread to the predominantly African-American neighborhood of Watts.Zoot Suit Riots Chapter Sixteen In Orange County, California, Mexican American school children were subject to racial segregation in the public school system and forced to attend \\"Mexican schools\\". In 1947, the Mendez v. Westminster ruling declared that segregating children of \\"Mexican and Latin descent\\" in state-operated public schools in Orange County was unconstitutional. This ruling helped lay the foundation for the landmark Brown v Board of Education case, which ended racial segregation in the public school system. 1950s‚Äì60s In many counties in the southwestern United States, Mexican Americans were not selected as jurors in court cases which involved a Mexican American defendant. In 1954, Pete Hernandez, an agricultural worker, was indicted of murder by an all-non- Hispanic White jury in Jackson County, Texas. Hernandez believed that the jury could not be impartial unless members of other races were allowed on the jury- selecting committees, seeing that a Mexican American had not been on a jury for more than 25 years in that particular county. Hernandez and his lawyers decided to take the case to the Supreme Court. The Hernandez v. Texas Supreme Court ruling declared that Mexican Americans and other cultural groups in the United States were entitled to equal protection under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Many organizations, businesses, and homeowners associations had official policies to exclude Mexican Americans. In many areas across the Southwest, Mexican Americans lived in separate residential areas, due to laws and real estate company policies. This group of laws and policies, known as redlining, lasted until the 1950s, and fall under the concept of official segregation.JS Online: Filmmaker explores practice of redlining in documentary 1970s One of the most vicious cases occurred at the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border west of Douglas, Arizona, on August 18, 1976, when three campesinos were attacked crossing a ranch belonging to Douglas dairyman George Hanigan. The three were kidnapped, stripped, hogtied, and had their feet burned before being cut loose and told to run back to Mexico. As they ran, the Hanigans shot birdshot into their backs. They made it to Agua Prieta, Sonora, where the Mexican police notified the Mexican consul, who lodged formal complaints against George Hanigan and his two sons. The elder Hanigan died of a heart attack; after three trials, one of the Hanigan sons was convicted in federal court and sentenced to three years, and the other was found not guilty.History News Network: \\"From Hanigan to SB 1070: How Arizona Got to Where It Is Today\\" by Geraldo Cadava August 22, 2010Miller, Tom. On the Border: Portraits of America's Southwestern Frontier, p. 143-173. 1980s‚Äì90s In 1994, California state voters approved Proposition 187 by a wide majority. The initiative made illegal immigrants ineligible for public health (except for emergencies), public social services, and public education; it required public agencies to report anyone they believed to be illegal to either the INS or the California attorney general; and it made it a felony to print, sell, or use false citizenship documents. Many Mexican Americans opposed such measures as reminiscent of pre-civil-rights-era ethnic discrimination and denounced these actions as illegal under state and federal laws, as well international law when it involves the rights of foreign nationals in other countries. The law was eventually declared unconstitutional by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The Chandler Roundup was a law enforcement operation in Chandler, Arizona, in 1997, in which suspected illegal immigrants were arrested based solely on their skin color. Many U.S. citizens and legal residents were also stopped and arrested. Present As of July 2018, 37.0 million Americans, or 10.3% of the United States' population, identify themselves as being of full or partial Mexican ancestry; comprising 61.9% of all Hispanics and Latinos in the United States. The United States is home to the second largest Mexican community in the world, second only to Mexico itself, comprising over 24% of the entire Mexican-origin population of the world (Canada is a distant third with a small Mexican Canadian population of 96,055 or 0.3% of the population as of 2011). In addition, as of 2008 there were approximately 7,000,000 Mexicans living illegally in the United States.Pew Hispanic Center: \\"A Portrait of Unauthorized Immigrants to the United States\\" April 11, 2009 In 2012, the United States admitted 145,326 Mexican immigrantsDepartment of Homeland Security: \\"2012 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics\\" 2012 and 1,323,978 Mexicans were waiting for a slot to open up so they could emigrate to the United States. A 2014 survey indicated that 34% of all Mexicans would immigrate to the United States if they were able. Some private citizen groups have been established to apprehend immigrants that have crossed into the United States illegally. These groups, like the Minuteman Project and other anti-immigration organizations, have been accused of discrimination because of their aggressive and sometimes illegal tactics.https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/04/immigrant-vigilantes- arizona-border-arivaca/ As Mexicans make up the majority of Latinos in the United States, when the non-Latino population is asked to comment on their perception of Latinos, they tend to think of stereotypes of Mexicans fueled by the media, which focuses on illegal immigration. Per a 2012 survey conducted by the National Hispanic Media Coalition, one-third of non-Hispanic Americans (Whites, Blacks, and Asians) falsely believe that half or more of the nation's Hispanics are \\"illegal immigrants with large families and little education\\". The report has been criticized on the grounds that it makes the same mistake that the media makes in aggregating all Latinos into a single group, thereby missing both the diversity of the situations the different groups are in and the varying perceptions of those groups by the non-Latino population. Relationships between Mexican Americans and the Black community have been tense at times, as migrants from Mexico often arrive in the United States with extant, racist sentiments regarding Blacks. In Mexico, Afro-Mexicans (who make up 1% of the population) report that they are regularly racially harassed by the local and state police. Mexican phrases abound that attribute negativity to the word Black ‚Äì such as \\"getting black\\" (meaning getting angry), the use of negro to mean \\"ugly\\", a \\"supper of blacks\\" or cena de negros (meaning a group of people gathering together to cause trouble)Consejo Para Prevenir y Eliminar La Discriminaci√≥n De La Ciudad De Mexico: \\"Personas Afrodescendientes\\" retrieved September 24, 2015  \\"En la vida diaria, el racismo se expresa sobre todo en chistes, comentarios y frases que ridiculizan, minusvaloran o desprecian a las personas por su tono de piel, su historia, su cultura, sus tradiciones o su condici√≥n social. Frases como 'El negrito en el arroz', que califica como desagradable el tono de piel oscura; 'Trabajar como negro', que refleja la condici√≥n de esclavo y sobreexplotaci√≥n a la que estuvieron sometidos los pueblos africanos; 'Cena de negros', que indica que las personas de este tono de piel se comportan de manera violenta o poco amable, son algunos ejemplos de esas pr√°cticas, que muchas veces se reproducen de manera irreflexiva\\" el negrito en el arroz (translated as \\"the black in the rice\\", meaning an unpleasant dark skin tone), and trabajar como negro (translated as \\"work like black\\", meaning to work like a slave). The origin of the tension has also been attributed to competition for blue-collar jobs, cultural disputes in changing neighborhoods, and resentment by Blacks that Latinos have benefited from their efforts during the civil rights movement. In the early 2010s, the Mexican Mafia attempted to drive out Black residents from traditional Black neighborhoods through racial intimidation, threats, and violence.Fox News Latino: \\"Latino Gang Tried to Drive All Blacks From California City\\" June 8, 2011Los Angeles Times: \\"Attack on family in Compton latest incident in wave of anti-black violence\\" By Sam Quinones, Richard Winton and Joe Mozingo January 25, 2013. American president Donald Trump expressed his fear of rising illegal Mexican immigration throughout his 2015-2016 campaign, referring to Mexican immigrants as criminals, rapists, and drug smugglers/dealers. He also has expressed displeasure over how the Mexican government has handled illegal immigration and drug smuggling into the United States over the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald- trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/ Various sources have accused Trump of anti-Mexican hate speech and claimed that his \\"hateful rhetoric\\" has incited anti-Mexican sentiment and xenophobia. From 2003 to 2007 in California, the state with the largest Mexican and Mexican American population, the number of hate crimes against Mexicans almost doubled. The anti-Mexican feelings can also be directed against other Latino American nationalities in the US, even though anti-Mexican sentiment exists in some Caribbean and Latino groups.http://ccsre.stanford.edu/reports/exec_summary5.pdf Orlando Sentinel: \\"Hate Fuels Fight In Kissimmee - Puerto Rican Youth Is Beaten, 2 Men Are Charged In Attack\\" By Lenny Savino July 8, 1998. \\"'One of them [Crespo] said you're Mexican, talk to Mexican girls, not American girls,' Rosado said. 'He got out of the car. I didn't say anything.

Witnesses reported that the assailants yelled racial epithets at Ramirez as they attacked him. Luis' White, non-Hispanic fiance√© and mother of his two children, Crystal Dillman, was quoted as saying of the four teenagers, \\"I think they might get off, because Luis was an illegal Mexican and these are 'all-American boys' on the football team who get good grades, or whatever they're saying about them. They'll find some way to let them go.\\" Brandon Piekarsky, 17, and Derrick Donchak, 19, received sentences of 7 to 23 months for their roles in the murder of 25-year-old Mexican immigrant Luis Ramirez. Piekarsky and Donchak were subsequently convicted of civil rights violations in federal court and sentenced to 9 years in federal prison. In 2008, Mexican Rodolfo Olmedo was dragged down by a group of men shouting anti-Mexican epithets and bashed over the head with a wooden stick on the street outside his home, the first of 11 suspected attacks that year motivated by anti-Hispanic bias in the Staten Island neighborhood of Port Richmond, Staten Island. Port Richmond is a predominantly African-American neighborhood that has seen a large influx of Mexican immigrants.Fox News: \\"Attacks against Mexican immigrants in NYC's Staten Island inflame black-Hispanic tensions\\" August 16, 2010 Rolston Hopson, William Marcano and Tyrone Goodman, all age 17, were charged in the assault.NY1: \\"Four Teens Charged With Alleged Staten Island Bias Attack\\" By Tetiana Anderson April 10, 2010 The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the United States Border Patrol have been frequently criticized for alleged anti-Mexican speech and actions. In July 2019, more than 60 border patrol agents were investigated over their participation in a Facebook page that mocked Mexicans and immigrants as well as minority lawmakers. In modern times, organizations including neo-Nazi, white supremacist, American nationalist, and nativist groups have all been known to intimidate, harass and advocate the use of violence against Mexican Americans. A domestic terrorist attack/mass shooting occurred on August 3, 2019, at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, resulting in 23 people dead and 23 injured, almost all of whom were Hispanic Americans and/or Mexicans. The suspect, Patrick Crusius, told El Paso police he was trying to kill as many Mexicans as possible. In a manifesto titled The Inconvenient Truth, published on 8chan just before the attacks, Crusius cited several white nationalist beliefs such as a supposed \\"Hispanic invasion of Texas\\", The Great Replacement conspiracy theory and \\"simply trying to defend my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion\\" (White genocide conspiracy theory) as well \\"the degradation of the environment\\", contempt towards corporations, and fears about automation. Crusius said he was inspired in part by the Christchurch mosque shootings. See also * Anti-Chilean sentiment * Anti-Venezuelan sentiment * Hispanophobia * Madrigal v.

Sixteen of his popular pre-war novels were the basis of movies. His later novels are literary hagiographies of notable Roman Catholic saints and of different periods of the Bible. Life Wohl was born in Berlin to a poor Catholic family, with a Hungarian father and Austrian mother of Jewish descent.\\"my mother, herself a hereditary Baroness of Dreifus.\\" Ludwig de Wohl, I Follow my Stars, An Autobiography, London, 1937, p. 18 When he was only 17 years old, his mother pushed him into an apprenticeship to a banker, from which he was dismissed in 1924, at the age of 21.Brief autobiography by de Wohl In 1935, he emigrated to England due to his objections to the Nazi regime. Some sources claim that he there had a wife named Alexandra, who fled to Santiago, Chile, where she claimed to be a Romanian princess and was known as \\"La Baronessa.\\" Wohl worked as an astrologer for the British intelligence agency MI5 during World War II. His MI5 file was released in early 2008. He was recruited initially by Sir Charles Hambro, then running the Special Operations Executive, to devise black propaganda for use against Germany, and allegedly as an informant because he was casting horoscopes for people of interest to MI5. In May 1941 he was sent to America to contribute to astrological magazines and newspapers which at the time were using articles by astrologers favourable to Nazi Germany. In the United States, Wohl published many articles, lectured against Germany and was interviewed several times by the press. He then returned to England in February 1942, claiming that he had been promised a commission in the British Army. Sefton Delmer, a notable purveyor of black propaganda, arranged a fake document certifying de Wohl as a Captain in the British Army, and he took to wearing the uniform (though he refrained when he realized the position was untenable). His main value to Delmer was his contact with Karl Ernst Krafft, the German astrologer working in Berlin for Dr Goebbels. He assisted Delmer in forging copies of Krafft's magazine Zenit German and other astrological magazines dropped over Germany and 'foretelling' the destruction of U-boats. Delmer nevertheless continued to employ him until the end of the war, and considered his contribution valuable. During the war, Wohl became increasingly religious, and he had a successful postwar career writing novels regarding Roman Catholic Church history and the lives of the saints. In 1953, Wohl married Ruth Magdalene Lorch, who was a Lady Commander of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. He himself held the title of Knight Commander of the Order. Wohl died in Switzerland in 1961, shortly after finishing his final work, Founded on a Rock. Writing career He began writing as early as the age of 7. His teachers praised his ability. At the age of 8 he wrote the play \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" because he didn't like how Jesus was portrayed by some books he read. Writing as Ludwig von Wohl, he became quite a successful novelist during his youth in Germany, where sixteen of his novels were turned into films. The best known of these was the 1934 comedy classic Die englische Heirat (The English Marriage).Die englische Heirat on IMDb In an audience with Pope Pius XII he was told to \\"write about the history and mission of the Church in the World.\\" The Cardinal of Milan, Ildefonso Schuster, came to de Wohl after reading some of his writings telling him \\"Let your writings be good. For your writings you will one day be judged.\\" From that time, he allegedly believed that he had to write for God, and felt that his earlier novels in the German language were of 'small significance compared to the novels he wrote for the glory of God'. His novel The Spear brought him international acclaim. Even now Louis de Wohl's books are widely read. His non-fiction work, Founded on a Rock: A History of the Catholic Church is often required reading for RCIA students. He has written books on St. Benedict, St. Francis of Assisi, Joan of Arc, and Constantine I among many others.

Plot Lo Jui plays Sun Yu Ting, a Kung Fu fanatic in search of a teacher. After five years of challenging masters but never being beaten he runs into Hsu Shi (William Yen), a young Shaolin monk who stole money from a gambling match in order to acquire meat and wine for his master, who later discovers Yu Ting inside the Buddhist temple. Although Hsu's master (often referred to as Grandmaster) defeats Yu with ease he refuses to take him on as a student. Yu then resorts to trickery to try to learn techniques from the aged monk, Using the techniques the master uses against himself. Eventually these antics come to the attention of the senior abbot who expels Yu Ting from the temple altogether. Yu is only allowed back into the temple after he rescues a girl escaping from the dreaded Sky hawk clan. The head of the gang is a chief Lama, Yao Feng Lin, a sworn enemy of Shaolin who, twelve years ago, stole one of temple's most treasured martial arts manuals: the I ching manual. Hsu Shi's master eventually agrees to take Yu Ting on as a student but lessons are cut short when the Lama turns up and kills the master (who therefore becomes ex- master). Yu now swears revenge but before he can leave Shaolin he has to learn the 'Buddha Finger' technique, requested by his master to learn in order to defeat the Lama Chief.

He has been awarded several prizes including the Brazilian Order of Scientific Merit in the categories of Commander and Great Cross, the Conrado Wessel Prize for General Science, the Joaquim da Costa Ribeiro Prize and the Guggenheim Fellowship. His main contributions to science are new observations of the thermo-dielectric effect; the discovery of bioelectrets, i.e. electrets as a property of biological materials such as bone and biopolymers, enabling the development of a new detector used in radiological dosimetry to date human bones in archeological sites; and the development of a non-invasive procedure to measure intracranial pressure. Mascarenhas has contributed to the creation of important Brazilian research institutions, such as the farming instrumentation center of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation and the Federal University of S√£o Carlos.  Education  Mascarenhas earned his degree in Chemistry in 1951 from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and in Physics in 1952 from the Rio de Janeiro State University. He has been a visiting scholar in many universities around the world, including Carnegie Mellon, Princeton, Harvard, MIT and University of London.  Federal University of S√£o Carlos  S√©rgio Mascarenhas played a major role in the establishment of the Federal University of S√£o Carlos. Back in 1968, when the idea of creating the first federal university in S√£o Paulo state came up, Mascarenhas proposed the creation of an innovative university instead of a traditional one (Mascarenhas had moved from Rio de Janeiro to S√£o Carlos looking for more research opportunities in solid-state physics). The Federal University of S√£o Carlos was then established with that vision in mind and Mascarenhas was appointed the university's first rector, where he helped to create the materials engineering degree, the first of its kind in Latin America.

The Chancellor is the titular head of the University, although in practice it is led by the Vice-Chancellor, currently Hugh R. Brady, who is the University's Principal Academic Officer and chief executive officer. He is supported by a team of three Pro Vice-Chancellors, the Registrar and a Deputy Registrar. There are also three Pro Chancellors, but their roles are purely ceremonial, deputising for the Chancellor when he or she is unable to attend. Council Council comprises 32 membersBristol University  How the University is run  Governance: how the University is run with a lay majority and appoints its own chairman from among the lay members. The members are the Vice-Chancellor, the Pro-Vice-Chancellors, the Treasurer, 15 lay members elected by Court, a member appointed by Bristol City Council, a member appointed by the Society of Merchant Venturers, a member appointed by Convocation, 4 members of the academic staff, 2 members of the support staff and 3 students. Elected and appointed members serve for renewable three-year terms. The University Council is the supreme governing body of the University. It alone has the power to make changes to the University's Charter, Statutes and Ordinances and make the necessary recommendations to the Privy Council. The only exceptions to this are academic ordinances which Council may only make or amend with the consent of Senate, and changes to the constitutions of Court and Convocation which require approval from Court. If Court withholds consent, then after one year Council may impose the changes without Court's consent. The ceremonial officers of the University (the Chancellor and Pro- Chancellors) and the Treasurer are nominated by Council for approval by Court. The senior executive team of the University and the Professors are appointed by Council, after consulting Senate. Council may also institute or abolish any academic post, with Senate's consent. Honorary degrees are awarded by Council on nomination by Senate and Council recommends to Court the award of honorary fellowships. In fact, all degrees are awarded by Council, but for the most part this is after the approval of the relevant Board of Examiners and/or Degree Committee. Council is also ultimately responsible for the legal and financial affairs of the University and is, for example, the formal employer of all staff. The Council also holds Senate to account. It meets usually 6 times per year, and is advised by a large number of Committees, some jointly formed with Senate. Court There are approximately 550 members of Court. They include officers of the University, representatives of the non-academic staff, members of Council and Senate, emeritus Professors, benefactors, some members of the Society of Merchant Venturers, representatives of Local Authorities, people appointed by the Privy Council, people appointed by the Chancellor, representatives of other universities and colleges, local Members of Parliament and Members of the European Parliament, representatives of local and professional ('learned') societies, and about 100 members elected by and from Convocation. The students are represented by those they elect to Council and Senate and do not have direct electoral powers to Court. It is chaired by the Chancellor and usually meets once each year in December, although it may meet at other times if sufficiently many of its members so request. Court was formerly the only body in the University which could approve changes to the Charter and Statutes (before they were petitioned to the Privy Council). Thus, Council would recommend the changes and Court would debate and approve, amend or reject them. After a recent tussle with the Privy Council and the Department for Education and Skills, Court has lost these powers. Council is now the only body which can make such changes. Court's only residual powers in this respect are the ability to delay changes to the constitutions of itself and of Convocation; powers which were only barely retained. Some 'genuine' power retained is that to appoint the Chancellor, Pro-Chancellors and Treasurer, on the nomination of Council, to appoint the external auditors and to elect 15 of the lay members of Council. Note, however, that it can only select these (mainly ceremonial) posts on recommendation from other bodies and Court does not usually disagree with them. It also retains the power to remove its own members and those of Council, apart from those whose membership results from their office or from being members of the academic staff of the University. Thus most of the members of Court are excluded from this provision, though notably not most of Council, a situation the Privy Council does not seem concerned with. Court's role now is thus largely advisory. It receives an annual report from Council and the audited accounts. It may comment on the affairs of the University, may advise Council on any matter relating to the University and may invite Council to review a decision. Senate There are a little over 100 members of Senate including the Vice- Chancellor and Pro-Vice-Chancellors, Deans of Faculties, Heads of Departments, the Registrar, Librarian, the President and Vice-President of the Student's Union, the President of the Postgraduate Union, representatives of: the Undergraduate Deans, the Graduate Deans, the Professors and the non- professorial academic staff, and one undergraduate and one postgraduate student from each of the Faculties. Senate is the senior academic body in the University and changes or additions to the academic ordinances may only be made by Council with Senate's approval. It is responsible to Council for overseeing teaching, examinations and research and no new academic award may be created without Senate's approval. Recommendations for honorary degrees and professorships are made to Council by Senate and advice is given regarding the appointment or removal of the Vice-Chancellor, Pro-Vice-Chancellors and academic staff. Note that Senate has no influence over the Charter or Statutes, including the academic elements of them, since that power rests solely with Council. Being the ultimate academic authority in the University, Senate oversees the Faculties, Schools and Departments and may make recommendations to Council regarding their composition and structure. Similarly, it is the body formally responsible for controlling student admissions and student discipline. Senate has the formal power to declare an opinion on any matter relating to the University and Council is required to take that opinion into account in its discussions. Senate usually meets four times a year and is chaired by the Vice-Chancellor. After each meeting it reports to Council. There are a few Committees advising Senate, some construed jointly with Council. Convocation Convocation has a large number of members: the Chancellor, Pro-Chancellors, Vice-Chancellor, Pro-Vice- Chancellors, honorary fellows, members of Senate, academic staff, University officers, graduates, honorary graduates and such other former students as Convocation determines, currently those who have received academic awards requiring at least nine months of full-time study or an equivalent period of part-time study. There are also associate members, including all the academic- related staff of the University. It has little power in its own right, although it elects 100 members of Court and 1 member of Council. Like the other bodies, it may express an opinion on any matter relating to the University and it may communicate directly with Court, Council and Senate. Its principal function is to provide a forum for discussion for all the members of the University who have no other representation, and to organise alumni events and the like to ensure graduates stay in touch with the University. It meets each July, over a reunion weekend. It is formally chaired by the Chancellor, but the Chair of Convocation usually presides. Chancellors and Vice- Chancellors Bristol is headed formally by the Chancellor and led on a day- to-day basis by the Vice-Chancellor, currently Hugh R. Brady. The Chancellor may hold office for up to ten years and the Pro-Chancellors for up to three, unless the University Court determines otherwise, but the Vice-Chancellor and Pro-Vice-Chancellors have no term limits. As of 2016, the University has had seven Chancellors: In July 2016 it was announced that Sir Paul Nurse would become the eighth Chancellor of the University of Bristol in 2017. *Henry Overton Wills III, 1909‚Äì1911 *Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane, 1912‚Äì1928 *Sir Winston Churchill, 1929‚Äì1965 *Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort, 1965‚Äì1970 *Professor Dorothy Hodgkin, 1970‚Äì1988 *Sir Jeremy Morse, 1989‚Äì2003 *Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond, 2004‚Äì2017 *Sir Paul Nurse, 2017‚Äì As of 2016, there have been thirteen Vice-Chancellors: *Conwy Lloyd Morgan, 1909 *Sir Isambard Owen, 1909‚Äì1921 *E.

Moving coverings such as pistol slides, fore-end extension of the gunstock/chassis that do not fully encircle the barrel, and the receiver (or frame) of a firearm itself are generally not described as barrel shrouds, though they can functionally act as such. A handguard is a type of (often only half-length) barrel shrouding that is designed specifically for the operator to grip more frontally on the gun for better stability and control. Full-length barrel shrouds are commonly featured on air-cooled machine guns, where frequent rapid bursts or sustained automatic fire will leave the barrel extremely hot and dangerous to the operator. However, shrouds can also be utilized on semi-automatic firearms, especially the ones with light-weight barrels, as even a small number of shots can heat up a barrel enough to injure an operator in certain circumstances. Barrel shrouds are also used on pump-action shotguns. The military trench shotgun features a ventilated metal handguard with a bayonet attachment lug.Bruce N.

In September 1777, Congress fled Philadelphia to escape the British capture of the city. After failing to retake Philadelphia, Washington led his 12,000-man army into winter quarters at Valley Forge, located approximately 18 miles (29 km) northwest of Philadelphia. They remained there for six months, from December 19, 1777 to June 19, 1778. At Valley Forge, the Continentals struggled to manage a disastrous supply crisis while retraining and reorganizing their units. About 1,700 to 2,000 soldiers died from disease, possibly exacerbated by malnutrition. Today, Valley Forge National Historical Park protects and preserves over 3,500 acres of the original encampment site.  Pre-encampment  In 1777, Valley Forge consisted of a small proto-industrial community located at the juncture of the Valley Creek and the Schuylkill River. In 1742, Quaker industrialists established the Mount Joy Iron Forge. Largely thanks to capital improvements made by John Potts and his family over the following decades, the small community expanded the ironworks, established mills, and constructed new dwellings for residents.\\"Valley Forge Industry,\\" Valley Forge Briefs, no. 21. Surrounding the valley was a rich farmland, where mainly Welsh-Quaker farmers grew wheat, rye, hay, Indian corn, among other crops, and raised livestock including cattle, sheep, pigs, and barnyard fowl.Ann F. Rhoads, Douglas Ryan and Ella W. Aderman, Land use Study of Valley Forge National Historical Park (Philadelphia: Morris Arboretum of the University of Pennsylvania, 1989), 63-4. Settlers of German and Swedish descent also lived nearby. In the summer of 1777 the Continental Army's quartermaster general, Thomas Mifflin, decided to station a portion of his army's supplies in outbuildings around the forges, because of its variety of structures and secluded location between two prominent hills. Fearing such a concentration of military supplies would undoubtedly attract the British, the forge-ironmaster, William Dewees Jr., expressed concerns about the army's proposal. Mifflin heeded Dewees' concerns but established a magazine at Valley Forge anyway. After the British landing at Head of Elk (present-day Elkton, Maryland), on August 25, 1777, the British Army maneuvered out of the Chesapeake basin and towards Valley Forge. Following the Battle of Brandywine (September 11, 1777) and the abortive Battle of the Clouds (September 16), on September 18 several hundred soldiers under General Wilhelm von Knyphausen raided the supply magazine at Valley Forge. Despite the best efforts of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Hamilton and Captain Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee, the two Continental army officers selected to evacuate the supplies from Valley Forge, Crown soldiers captured supplies, destroyed others, and burned down the forges and other buildings. Winter quarters Political, strategic, and environmental factors all influenced the Continental Army's decision to establish their encampment near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania in the winter of 1777‚Äì1778. Washington conferred with his officers to select the site that would be most advantageous to his army. = Site selection = Washington first asked his generals where to quarter the Continental Army in the winter of 1777‚Äì1778 on October 29, 1777. In addition to suggestions from his officers, Washington also had to contend with the recommendations of politicians. Pennsylvania state legislators and the Continental Congress expected the Continental Army to select an encampment site that could protect the countryside around Philadelphia. Some members of the Continental Congress also believed that the army might be able to launch a winter campaign. Interested parties suggested other sites for an encampment, including Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Wilmington, Delaware. However, following the inconclusive Battle of Whitemarsh from December 5‚Äì8, increasing numbers of officers and politicians began to appreciate the need to defend the greater Philadelphia region from British incursions. Considering these questions, an encampment at Valley Forge had notable advantages. Valley Forge's high terrain meant that enemy attacks would be difficult. Its location allowed for soldiers to be readily detached to protect the countryside. Proximity to the Schuylkill River could facilitate supply movements down the river. Wide, open areas provided space for drilling and training. On December 19, Washington conducted his 12,000-man army to Valley Forge to establish the encampment. The encampment was primarily situated along the high, flat ground east of Mount Joy and south of the Schuylkill River.Historical Research Valley Forge State Park (West Chester, PA: National Heritage Corporation, 1974), 7-8. In addition to a concentration of soldiers at Valley Forge, Washington ordered nearly 2,000 soldiers to encamp at Wilmington, Delaware. He posted the army's mounted troops at Trenton, New Jersey, and additional outposts at Downingtown and Radnor, Pennsylvania, among other places. In the two winter encampments prior to Valley Forge, the Continental army had sheltered themselves in a combination of tents, constructed huts, civilian barns and other buildings. Valley Forge marked the first time Washington ordered the army primarily concentrated into a more permanent post where they constructed their own shelters. This strategic shift encouraged a whole new host of problems for the American Patriots. = March and hut construction = A reproduction hut at Valley Forge National Historical Park. The hut stands at the site of a recreated brigade encampment along North Outer Line Drive. As the men marched to Valley Forge, George Washington wrote, \\"To see men without clothes to cover their nakedness, without blankets to lay on, without shoes by which their marches might be traced by the blood from their feet, and almost as often without provisions as with; marching through frost and snow and at Christmas taking up their winter quarters within a day's march of the enemy, without a house or hut to cover them till they could be built, and submitting to it without a murmur is a mark of patience and obedience which in my opinion can scarce be paralleled.\\"Nathaniel Philbrick, \\"Valiant Ambition: George Washington, Benedict Arnold and the Fate of the American Revolution,\\" (New York: Penguin Books, 2016), p. 187-88 The Valley Forge encampment became the Continental Army's first large-scale construction of living quarters. While no accurate account exists for the number of log huts built, experts estimate a range between 1,300 and 1,600 structures. Brigadier General Louis Leb√®gue de Presle Duportail selected grounds for the brigade encampments and planned the defenses. Afterwards, brigadier generals appointed officers from each regiment to mark out the precise spot for every officer and all enlisted men's huts. Despite commanders' attempts at standardization, the huts varied in terms of size, materials, and construction techniques. Military historian John B. B. Trussell Jr. writes that many squads \\"dug their floors almost two feet below ground level,\\" to reduce wind exposure or the number of logs required for construction. In addition, some huts had thatched straw roofs, while others consisted of brush, canvas, or clapboards. In a letter to his wife Adrienne, Lafayette described the huts as \\"small barracks, which are scarcely more cheerful than dungeons.\\" = Supply challenges = The Continental Army that marched into Valley Forge consisted of about 12,000 people‚Äîsoldiers, artificers, women, and children. Throughout the winter, patriot commanders and legislators faced the challenge of supplying a population the size of a colonial city. In May and June 1777, the Continental Congress had authorized the reorganization of the supply department. Implementation of those changes never fully took effect, because of the fighting surrounding Philadelphia. Consequently, the supply chain had broken down even before the Continental Army arrived at Valley Forge. In large part, supplies dried up through the neglect of Congress so that by the end of December 1777 Washington had no way to feed or to adequately clothe the soldiers.Nathaniel Philbrick, \\"Valiant Ambition: George Washington, Benedict Arnold and the Fate of the American Revolution,\\" (New York: Penguin Books, 2016), p. 188 Washington chose the area partly for its strategic benefits, but wintertime road conditions impeded supply wagons on route to the encampment. That winter, starvation and disease killed more than 1,000 soldiersNathaniel Philbrick, \\"Valiant Ambition: George Washington, Benedict Arnold and the Fate of the American Revolution,\\" (New York: Penguin Books, 2016), p. 197 and perhaps as many as 1,500 horses. The men suffered from continual, gnawing hunger and cold. Washington ordered that soldiers' rations include either one to one-and-a-half pounds of flour or bread, one pound of salted beef or fish, or three-quarters pound of salted pork, one gill of whiskey or spirits, or one-and-a-half pounds of flour or bread, a half-pound of bacon or salted pork, a half-pint of peas or beans, and one gill of whiskey or spirits. In practice, however, the army could not reliably supply the full ration. Perishable foods began to rot before reaching the troops because of poor storage, transportation problems, or confusion regarding the supplies' whereabouts. Other rations became lost or captured by the enemy. Traveling to market proved dangerous for some vendors. When combined with the Continental Army's lack of hard currency, prices for perishable goods inflated. Therefore, during the first few days of constructing their huts, the Continentals primarily ate firecake, a tasteless mixture of flour and water cooked upon heated rocks. In his memoir, Joseph Plumb Martin wrote that \\"to go into the wild woods and build us habitations to stay (not to live) in, in such a weak, starved and naked condition, was appalling in the highest degree.\\" Resentment swelled within the ranks towards those deemed responsible for their hardship. On December 23, Washington wrote Henry Laurens, the President of the Continental Congress. Washington related how his commanders had just exerted themselves with some difficulty to quell a \\"dangerous mutiny\\" fomenting, because of the lack of provision. Washington continued with a dire warning to Congress: \\"unless some great and capital change suddenly takes place in that line, this Army must inevitably be reduced to one or other of these three things, Starve, dissolve, or disperse, in order to obtain subsistence in the best manner they can.\\" While Washington dealt with serious circumstances, he may have exaggerated slightly to obtain a quicker response from the Continental Congress. That winter was not particularly harsh at Valley Forge, but many soldiers remained unfit for duty, owing to the disease, lack of proper clothing and uniforms (\\"naked\\" referred to a ragged or improperly attired individual). Years later, Lafayette recalled that \\"the unfortunate soldiers were in want of everything; they had neither coats, hats, shirts, nor shoes; their feet and legs froze till they had become almost black, and it was often necessary to amputate them.\\" On January 7, Christopher Marshall related how \\"ten teams of oxen, fit for slaughtering, came into camp, driven by loyal Philadelphia women. They also brought 2,000 shirts, smuggled from the city, sewn under the eyes of the enemy.\\"Christopher Marshall, in \\"200 Years Ago Today at Valley Forge: Diary of ChristopherMarshall\\" (in the possession of Valley Forge National Historical Park), January 7, 1778. While these women provided crucial assistance, most people remained relatively unaware of the Continental Army's plight‚Äî\\"an unavoidable result of a general policy\\" to prevent such intelligence from reaching the British. The outlook for the army's situation improved when a five-man congressional delegation arrived on January 24. The delegates consisted of \\"Francis Dana of Massachusetts, Nathaniel Folsom of New Hampshire, John Harvie of Virginia, Gouverneur Morris of New York, and Joseph Reed of Pennsylvania.\\" According to historian Wayne Bodle, they came to understand through their visit \\"how vulnerable the new army could be to logistical disruption, owing to its size, its organizational complexity, and its increasing mobility.\\" Washington and his aides convinced them to implement recommended reforms to the supply department. In March 1778, Congress also appointed Nathanael Greene as Quartermaster General, who reluctantly accepted at Washington's behest. One of the Continental Army's most able generals, Greene did not want an administrative position. Yet he and his staff better supplied the troops at a time when the weather and road conditions began to improve. The Schuylkill River also thawed, allowing the Continental Army to more easily to transport convoys from the main supply depot at Reading.  Environmental and disease conditions  Cannons at the Artillery Park Maintaining cleanliness was a challenge for the Continental Army. Scabies broke out because of the filthy conditions within the encampment, as did other deadlier ailments. The army had a limited water supply for cooking, washing, and bathing. Dead horse remains often lay unburied, and Washington found the smell of some places intolerable. Neither plumbing nor a standardized system of trash collection existed. To combat the spread of contagion, Washington commanded soldiers to burn tar or \\"the Powder of a Musquet Cartridge\\"in the huts everyday, to cleanse the air of putrefaction. On May 27, Washington had ordered his soldiers remove the mud-and-straw chinking from huts \\"to render them as airy as possible.\\" Outbreaks of typhoid and dysentery spread through contaminated food and water. Soldiers contracted influenza and pneumonia, while still others succumbed to typhus, caused by body lice. Although the inconsistent delivery of food rations did not cause starvation, it probably exacerbated the health of ailing soldiers. Some patients might have suffered from more than one ailment. In total, about 1,700-2,000 troops died during the Valley Forge encampment, mostly at general hospitals located in six different towns. Valley Forge had the highest mortality rate of any Continental Army encampment, and even most military engagements of the war. Despite the mortality rate, Washington did curb the spread of smallpox, which had plagued the Continental Army since the American Revolution had begun in 1775. In January 1777, Washington had ordered mass inoculation of his troops, but a year later at Valley Forge, smallpox broke out again. An investigation uncovered that 3,000-4,000 troops had not received inoculations, despite having long-term enlistments. So, Washington ordered inoculations for any soldiers vulnerable to the disease. A precursor to vaccination (introduced by Edward Jenner in 1798), inoculation gave the patient a milder form of smallpox with better recovery rates than if the patient had acquired the disease naturally. The procedure provided lifetime immunity from a disease with a roughly 15-33% mortality rate. In June 1778, when the Continental -Army marched out of Valley Forge, they had completed \\"the first large-scale, state- sponsored immunization campaign in history.\\" By continuing the inoculation program for new recruits, Washington better maintained military strength among the regular, Continental Army troops throughout the remainder of the war. Encampment demographics While each hut housed a squad of twelve enlisted soldiers, sometimes soldiers' families joined them to share that space as well. Throughout the encampment period, Mary Ludwig Hays and approximately 250-400 other women had followed their soldier husbands or sweethearts to Valley Forge, sometimes with children in tow. Washington once wrote that \\"the multitude of women in particular, especially those who are pregnant, or have children, are a clog upon every movement.\\" Yet women on the whole proved invaluable, whether on the march or at an encampment like Valley Forge. They often earned income either by laundering clothes or by nursing troops, which kept soldiers cleaner and healthier. In turn, this made the troops appear more professional and disciplined. Lucy Flucker Knox, Catharine Littlefield \\"Caty\\" Greene, and other senior officers' wives journeyed to Valley Forge at the behest of their husbands. On 22 December, Martha Washington predicted that her husband would send for her as soon as his army went into winter quarter, and that \\"if he does I must go.\\"Nancy K. Loane, Following the Drum: Women at the Valley Forge Encampment (Dulles, VA: Potomac Books, 2009), 13. Indeed, she did, traveling in wartime with a group of slaves over poor roads, reaching her destination in early February. Washington's aide-de-camp Colonel Richard Kidder Meade met her at the Susquehanna ferry dock to escort her into the encampment. Over the next six months, Martha hosted political leaders and military officials, managing domestic staff within the confined space of Washington's Headquarters. From December 1777 to June 1778, Washington made his headquarters in a business residence owned by Isaac Potts Valley Forge had a high percentage of racial and ethnic diversity, since Washington's army comprised individuals from all 13 states. About 30% of Continental soldiers at Valley Forge did not speak English as their first language. Many soldiers and commanders hailed from German-speaking communities, as with Pennsylvania-born Brigadier General Peter Muhlenberg. Still others spoke Scottish- or Irish- Gaelic, and a few descended from French-speaking Huguenot and Dutch-speaking communities in New York. Local residents sometimes conversed in Welsh. Several senior officers in the Continental Army originally came from France, Prussia, Poland, Ireland, and Hungary. Although Native and/or African American men served the Continental Army as drovers, waggoneers, and laborers, others fought as soldiers, particularly from Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The smallest of the states, Rhode Island had difficulty meeting recruitment quotas for white men, spurring Brigadier General James Mitchell Varnum to suggest the enlistment of slaves for his 1st Rhode Island Regiment. Over a four-month period in 1778, the Rhode Island General Assembly allowed for their recruitment. In exchange for enlisting, soldiers of the 1st Rhode Island Regiment gained immediate emancipation, and their former owners received financial compensation equal to the slave's market value. By January 1778, nearly 10% of Washington's effective force consisted of African American troops. Commanders brought servants and enslaved people with them into the encampment, usually Black people. Washington's enslaved domestic staff included his manservant William Lee, as well as cooks Hannah Till and her husband Isaac. William Lee had married Margaret Thomas, a free Black woman who worked as a laundress at Washington's Headquarters. Hannah Till's legal owner Reverend John Mason lent her out to Washington, but Hannah secured an arrangement whereby she eventually bought her freedom.Nancy K. Loane, Following the Drum, 106-7. By Spring of 1778, Wappinger, Oneida and Tuscarora warriors who were on the side of the Patriots, with prominent Oneida leader Joseph Louis Cook of the St. Regis Mohawk among them, had joined the Americans at Valley Forge. Most served as scouts, keeping an eye out for British raiding parties in the area, and in May 1778, they fought under Lafayette at Barren Hill. In the oral history of the Oneida people, a prominent Oneida woman named Polly Cooper brought \\"hundreds of bushels of white corn\\" to hungry troops, teaching them how to process it for safe consumption. During the Revolutionary War, most Native American tribes sided with the British in order to protect their traditional homelands from the encroachment of American settlers. However, several tribes, including the Oneida, sided with the Patriots due in part to ties with American settlers, such as Presbyterian minister Samuel Kirkland. The Seven Nations of Canada and the Iroquois at what would be the Six Nations Reserve, who were mostly emigrants from the colony of New York, were brought to the brink of war by the Anglo-American conflict.Darren Bonaparte, \\"Too Many Chiefs\\", Wampum Chronicles, p. 6 Organizational challenges Among the challenges befalling the Continental Army during the Valley Forge winter included poor organization. Two years of war, shuffling leadership, and uneven recruitment resulted in irregular unit organization and strength. During the Valley Forge encampment, the army was reorganized into five divisions under Major Generals Charles Lee, Marquis de Lafayette, Johan de Kalb, and William Alexander \\"Lord Stirling,\\" with Brigadier General Anthony Wayne serving in place of Mifflin. Thanks to the widespread reorganization, unit strength and the terms of service became more standardized, improving the Continental army's efficiency. Although Washington enjoyed support among enlisted soldiers, commissioned officers and congressional officials were not as enthusiastic. During the Valley Forge winter, Washington's detractors attacked his leadership ability in both private correspondence and in popular publications. One anonymous letter in January 1778 disparaged Washington. It read, \\"The proper methods of attacking, beating, and conquering the Enemy has never as yet been adapted by the Commander in [Chief].\\" While historians disagree as to the seriousness of the threat to Washington's leadership during the Valley Forge winter, the most organized of these threats (albeit loosely- organized) was the so-called Conway Cabal. The cabal involved an attempt by a handful of military officers and American politicians to replace Washington with Major General Horatio Gates as the head of the Continental army. The movement was nominally led by Thomas Conway, a foreign Continental army general and critic of Washington's leadership. If the cabal ever posed any real threat to Washington's leadership, a series of leaks and embarrassing exposures in the fall and winter of 1777 and 1778 dissolved the threat. Thanks to the demise of the cabal, following the Valley Forge encampment George Washington's reputation in the American war effort improved. =Training= An Edwin Austin Abbey painting of Baron Steuben drilling American troops at Valley Forge in 1778 Increasing military efficiency, morale, and discipline improved the army's well-being with better supply of food and arms. The Continental Army had been hindered in battle because units administered training from a variety of field manuals, making coordinated battle movements awkward and difficult. They struggled with basic formations and lacked uniformity, thanks to multiple drilling techniques taught in various ways by different officers. The task of developing and carrying out an effective training program fell to Baron Friedrich von Steuben, a Prussian drill master who had recently arrived from Europe. He drilled the soldiers, improving their battle and formation techniques. Under Steuben's leadership, the Continentals practiced volley fire, improved maneuverability, standardized their march paces, exercised skirmishing operations, and drilled bayonet proficiency. These new efforts to train and discipline the army also improved morale among the soldiers more generally.Wayne Bodle, The Valley Forge Winter: Soldiers and Civilians in War (University Park: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2002), 202.  French Alliance  Initially, France remained reluctant to directly involve themselves in the war against Great Britain. In part, they worried that revolutionary fervor might spread into their own empire (which it did by 1789), but they also did not think the American colonists could win. However, the October 1777 surrender of British General John Burgoyne's army at Saratoga won for Americans the assistance they needed from other foreign powers.Edmund S. Morgan, The Birth of the Republic, 1763-89, Fourth Edition (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), 82. France and the United States subsequently signed a treaty on February 6, 1778, creating a military alliance between the two countries. In response, Great Britain declared war on France five weeks later, on March 17. On May 6, having already received word of the French Alliance, Washington ordered the Continental Army to perform a Grand Feu de Joie, a formal ceremony consisting of a rapid and sequential firing of guns down the ranks. Continental officer George Ewing wrote that \\"the troops then shouted, three cheers and 'Long live the King of France!' after this‚Ä¶three cheers and shout of 'God Save the friendly Powers of Europe!'‚Ä¶and cheers and a shout of 'God Save the American States!'\\"George Ewing, \\"The Military Journal of George Ewing: A Soldier of Valley Forge ‚Äì Pages 41-54,\\" Ewing Family History, last modified September 16, 2006, http://www.sandcastles.net/journal4.htm. Each soldier received an extra gill of rum (about four ounces) to enjoy that day, and after the troops' dismissal, Washington and other officers drank many patriotic toasts and concluded the day \\"with harmless Mirth and jollity.\\" They had cause for celebration. As empires, both France and Great Britain had territory around the world that required protection. Sir Henry Clinton replaced General Sir William Howe as British Commander-in-Chief of Land Forces in North America, and had to divert troops from Philadelphia to the Crown's valuable possessions in the West Indies. The British also feared a French naval blockade of Philadelphia, so in June, Clinton abandoned it for New York City‚Äîa loyalist stronghold. On June 18, Washington and his troops marched after them, with the remainder vacating Valley Forge one day later‚Äîexactly six months after the Continental Army had arrived.  Battle of Monmouth  As they marched through south and central New Jersey on their way to New York City, the British destroyed property and confiscated supplies and food, inspiring growing enmity among the area's civilians.Mark Edward Lender and Garry Wheeler Stone, Fatal Sunday: George Washington, the Monmouth Campaign, and the Politics of Battle (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2016), 146. Meanwhile, small-scale cooperative operations between the Continentals and New Jersey militia harassed and exhausted the British forces.Mark Edward Lender and Garry Wheeler Stone, Fatal Sunday: George Washington, the Monmouth Campaign, and the Politics of Battle (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2016), 169-70. The armies met on the morning of June 28, beginning the Battle of Monmouth. Continental soldiers under the command of General Charles Lee engaged the British in approximately five hours of continuous fighting in a ferocious heat. That night, British General Sir Henry Clinton moved his army out of Freehold and resumed their march to Manhattan. Both sides claimed elements of victory. The British army completed its march to New York City, while the Continental Army had forced a battle and performed admirably on an open field. The standardized training instilled at Valley Forge had improved their performance on the battlefield.  Myth and memory  World War II propaganda poster Valley Forge long occupied a prominent place in U.S. storytelling and memory. The image of Valley Forge as a site of terrible suffering and unshakeable perseverance emerged years after the encampment ended. One of the most enduring myths about the Valley Forge encampment concerns the weather. Later depictions of Valley Forge described the encampment as blanketed in snow, with exposure and frostbite supposedly claiming the lives of many soldiers. Amputations occurred, but no corroborating sources state that death occurred from the freezing temperatures alone. Rather, snowfall occurred infrequently, above- freezing temperatures were regular, and ice was uncommon. Stories of harsh weather likely originated from the 1779-1780 winter encampment at Jockey Hollow, near Morristown, New Jersey, which had the coldest winter of the war. One of the most popular Valley Forge myths involves Washington kneeling in the snow praying for his army's salvation. The image was popularized in paintings and in newspapers, and at one point, President Ronald Reagan even repeated it. However, no contemporary evidence exists suggesting such a prayer occurred. The story first appeared in an 1804 article by Mason Locke Weems, an itinerant minister, popular folklorist, and Washington biographer. In Weems' story, a neutral Quaker named Isaac Potts discovered Washington at prayer, relayed the story to his wife, and then declared his support for the U.S. cause.Garry Wills, Cincinnatus: George Washington and the Enlightenment (Garden City, NY: Doubleday and Company, Inc., 1984), 50. However, Potts did not live near Valley Forge during the encampment period and did not marry his wife until 1803. Despite the dubious origins, many have repeated the story over the years.Edward Lengel, Inventing George Washington: America's Founder, in Myth and Memory (New York: HarperCollins, 2011), 82-84.

Norrington Manor: Sir Wadham Wyndham's country house which he left to his eldest son, Colonel John Wyndham Origins He was born at Orchard Wyndham, Somerset, the ninth son of Sir John Wyndham (1558‚Äì1645) of Orchard Wyndham, by his wife, Joan Portman, daughter of Sir Henry Portman of Orchard Portman, Somerset. He was named after the family of his grandmother, Florence Wadham (d.1596), sister and in her issue co-heiress, of Nicholas Wadham (d.1609), of Merryfield, Ilton, founder of Wadham College, Oxford. The estate of Merryfield and lands at Ilton became the inheritance of the Wyndham family, and Wadham Wyndham made his seat at Ilton. Legal career Educated at Wadham College, Oxford, he entered Lincoln's Inn on 22 October 1628, being called to the bar on 17 May 1636. He was made a serjeant-at-law by royal authority in October 1660, and took part in the prosecution of the regicides. On 24 November 1660 he was created a Justice of the King's Bench, being knighted by Charles II on 4 December 1660. He remained a judge until 1668. The Great Fire After the Great Fire of London in 1666, Sir Wadham Wyndham, along with his brother Sir Hugh Wyndham, was a judge at the Fire Court set up in 1667 to hear cases relating to property destroyed in the fire. The Court sat at Clifford's Inn and focused primarily on deciding who would pay for a property to be rebuilt, and cases were heard and a verdict usually given within a day. The judges worked for free, three to four days a week and without the Fire Court legal wrangles could have dragged on for months seriously delaying the rebuilding which was so necessary if London was to recover. As a reward for their efforts, the artist John Michael Wright (c. 1617-1694), was commissioned to paint portraits of all 22 judges that had sat in the Fire Court. While his brother's portrait remains part of the Guildhall Art Gallery collection, Sir Wadham's portrait was ironically destroyed by fire in The Blitz. Family life On 12 January 1647 he married Barbara Clarke (1627‚Äì1704), daughter of Sir George Clarke (d.1689) of Watford Manor, Watford, Northamptonshire, MP for Northamptonshire in 1661.History of Parliament Trust, House of Commons, Members 1660-1690 They had eight sons (two of whom predeceased their father) and four daughters, born between 1648 and 1666. By the late 1650s his successful practice at the bar enabled him to purchase the manor of Norrington in Wiltshire, in 1658,Purchase of Norrington per Burke's Landed Gentry, 1937, p.2511, pedigree of Wyndham and also St Edmund's College in Salisbury, in the same county. He left Norrington to his eldest son, John Wyndham, and St Edmund's to his 2nd son Wadham Wyndham, whilst his 3rd son William Wyndham purchased in 1689 the Wiltshire manor of Dinton.Purchase of Dinton per Burke's Landed Gentry, 1937, p.2511, pedigree of Wyndham Sir Wadham thus founded the three Wiltshire branches of the Wyndham family.

Constructing artwork Calvin constructs her photographs by montaging multiple slide projections and found objects into room-sized assemblages in her studio. She then photographs it, making a tableaux into which layers of meaning are woven. She does not use computer editing, just straight photography. Calvin stated, \\"The images can be seen as my commentary on the political and social roles projected onto society whose desires, manipulated by language and image, conflict with concerns of gender, sexuality, race and female identity.\\" She says, \\"I make photographs, I don‚Äôt take them. I am a maker of meaning, not an observer of it.My medium is photography, although it is includes the processes of sculpture and installation .

Daredevils Of Kung Fu, a.k.a. Magnificent Acrobats) is a 1979 Shaw Brothers film directed by Chang Cheh, starring the Venoms. It is known internationally by its American title Daredevils Of Kung Fu (as distributed by World Northal). The film has no connection whatsoever to the Shaolin Temple, Shaolin martial arts, nor is there any mention of \\"Shaolin\\" throughout the entire film. Plot The Venoms (all on the same side, including Lu Feng!), a group of broke street performers take on a corrupt general (Wang Li) who has assumed power by assassinating his superior. The son of the murdered general (Lo Mang), now homeless, turns to his friends to help him get revenge. The smartest of the bunch (Kuo Chui) initially thinks it's a bad idea as the army, led by Wang Li has guns and rifles. Kuo eventually comes up with a successful plan to steal some guns to get revenge but guards arrive before they can get bullets (thus, worthless guns). After Lo Mang decides to go solo, he is killed by Wang Li's kung fu. Kuo, and the other three venoms decide to use brains instead of brawn to take revenge for Lo Mang. Lu Feng poses as a visiting government official with the other venoms as his assistants, and as a peace token offers Wang Li the stolen guns (with Wang Li not knowing they are his guns originally). Wang Li thinks Lu Feng will promote him so he agrees to a fake plan by Lu Feng to go get more guns from a warehouse and send his soldiers to a non-existent battle. Wang Li and his three of his best fighters go to the warehouse but are ambushed by the Venoms as they get revenge for Lo Mang and his father.

Location The caf√© occupies the ground floor of the Palais Lieben-Auspitz, which is near the Burgtheater, the University of Vienna, the Town Hall with the Rathauspark, and the Federal Chancellery. As a result of its location, the caf√© is a popular meeting place for actors, politicians, officials, and journalists, and is often the scene of press conferences. History Caf√© Landtmann photographed from the roof of the Burgtheater in Vienna, Austria Caf√© Landtmann was founded by Franz Landtmann on 1 October 1873. Originally from the W√§hring district, Landtmann came from a family of coffeehouse owners, gingerbread bakers, and fig coffee manufacturers. At the time the original caf√© opened, its Ringstra√üe location was directly opposite two vast construction sites for the new Town Hall and the new university. Next to the caf√© were the remains of L√∂welbastei, where the Burgtheater would later be built. In 1881, Landtmann sold his caf√© to two brothers, Wilhelm and Rudolf Kerl, who continued to run the business under the name Landtmann. After Rudolf retired, Wilhelm ran the caf√© alone and became a local celebrity with prominent figures like Gustav Mahler, Sigmund Freud, and Emmerich K√°lm√°n visiting him regularly. In 1916, after 35 years of running the business, Wilhelm sold Caf√© Landtmann to Karl Kraus, a former butcher and restaurateur. Together with the Hokare Ges.m.b.H. private limited company, Kraus ran the caf√© for five years. Caf√© Landtmann interior In the fall of 1926, Caf√© Landtmann was purchased by Konrad and Angela Zauner. In 1929, the couple had the coffeehouse expanded and completely renovated, hiring famed architect and professor Ernst Meller, who was responsible for designing numerous Viennese coffeehouses of that time. It was during this renovation that Caf√© Landtmann received its extravagant and lavish interior decorations, which are still preserved to this day, including the four wooden columns at the entrance, sculpted by Hans Scheibner. Following World War II, Konrad turned over the management of the caf√© to his son Erwin, who continued running it successfully until 1976, when it was sold to the Querfeld family. Under the Querfeld family's management, Caf√© Landtmann was completely renovated at significant financial cost in 1982, and then again in 2001 and 2002. On 1 October 1998, for the 125th anniversary of Caf√© Landtmann, the Querfeld family organized a large party attended by celebrities from the political and cultural life of the city, as well as many regular patrons. In 2003, the caf√©'s famous head waiter Robert B√∂ck, known as \\"Herr Robert,\\" retired after serving there for 28 years. During its long history, Caf√© Landtmann served as a meeting place for many of the leading industrialists, politicians, thinkers, and artists in Austria, and was the preferred coffeehouse of Sigmund Freud, Gustav Mahler, Peter Altenberg, Felix Salten, and Emmerich K√°lm√°n. Caf√© Landtmann is mentioned in James A. Michener's novel Poland, as well as Eva Ibbotson's The Morning Gift.

Strom is a pioneer among klezmer (musical tradition of the Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe) revivalists in conducting extensive field research in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkans among the Jewish and Rom communities since 1981. Initially, his work focused primarily on the use and performance of klezmer music between these two groups. Gradually, his focus increased to examining all aspects of their culture, from post-World War II to the present. He was among the first of the so-called klezmer revivalists to identify the connection between klezmer and lautare (Rom/Gypsy musicians) and explore that connection in his scholarly and artistic works. In the more than two decades since his initial ethnographic trip, Strom has become one of the world's most productive and influential scholar-artists of klezmer culture and history. Career =Music= Yale Strom's klezmer field research helped form the base for the repertoires of his two klezmer bands, Hot Pstromi in New York and Klazzj in San Diego (combined in 2006 under the Hot Pstromi umbrella).Hotpstromi.com Since Strom's first band began in 1981, he has been composing his own New Jewish music, which combines klezmer with Hasidic nigunim, Rom, jazz, classical, Balkan and Sephardic motifs. These compositions range from quartets to a symphony, which premiered with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. He composed original music for the Denver Center production of Tony Kushner's \\"The Dybbuk\\". He also composed all the New Jewish music for the National Public Radio series \\"Fiddlers, Philosophers & Fools: Jewish Short Stories From the Old World to the New\\", hosted by Leonard Nimoy, as well as numerous film scores. Strom is also one of the only two composers of Jewish music to carry on the tradition of writing original songs, with Yiddish lyrics, about humanitarian and social issues. List of CD recordings: \\"Cholent With Huckleberry\\" (Rounder, 1985), \\"Eclectic Klezz\\" (Rounder/Global Village, 1987), \\"With A Little Horseradish on the Side\\" (Global Village, 1993 - featuring original Hot Pstromi lineup of Strom, Andy Statman, Mark Dresser, Ismail Butera and Seido Salifoski), \\"The Last Klezmer\\" (Global Village, 1994), \\"Carpati: 50 Miles, 50 Years\\" (Global Village, 1996), \\"Wandering Jew\\" (Global Village, 1997),\\"Tales Our Father Sang\\" (Global Village, 1998), \\"Garden of Yidn\\" (Naxos World, 2000) \\"Cafe Jew Zoo\\" (Naxos World, 2002), \\"Dveykes/Adhesion\\" (Global Village, 2005) \\"Absolutely Complete Klezmer\\" (Transcontinental Music, 2006), \\"Borsht with Bread, Brothers\\" (ARC Music UK, 2007), \\"Absolutely Klezmer, Vol. II\\" (Transcontinental, 2007), \\"The Devil's Brides: Music from The Witches of Lublin\\" (ARC Music UK, 2011, featuring narration by actress Miriam Margolyes). Strom has performed with many well- known musicians including Andy Statman, Mark Dresser, Marty Ehrlich, Mark O‚ÄôConnor, Alicia Svigals, Salman Ahmad, Samir Chatterjee, Muzsikas, K√°lm√°n Balogh, Damian Draghici, Marta Sebestyen, Tanya Kalmanovitch, Theo Bikel and myriad others. Strom has been hailed as \\"a commanding bandleader and composer\\" (Pulse! Magazine), \\"one of the best klezmer musicians in the country\\" (Houston Public News) and \\"an all-around musical visionary\\" (Seth Rogovoy). Dirty Linen sums it up most concisely: \\"Yale Strom is a Jewish roots trip unto himself\\". The New York Jewish Week writes: > \\"He's a gifted photographer and author, a talented documentary filmmaker and > has his own klezmer band... Strom's multifaceted career is a wonder, and his > work schedule is downright fiendish.\\" =Books= Strom's research has also resulted in nine booksYale Strom AOL site (including \\"The Last Jews of Eastern Europe\\" and \\"Uncertain Roads: Searching for the Gypsies\\". He was the first photographer since Roman Vishniac to publish photographs of Jews in the Eastern Bloc countries. His \\"The Book of Klezmer: The History, The Music, The Folklore\\", a 400-page history with original photos and sheet music gathered by Yale during his 60+ ethnographic trips to Central and Eastern Europe, was published by A Cappella Books in September, 2002; this was soon followed by the publication of the world's first \\"Music Minus One\\" Instructional Guide to Klezmer (Universal Edition, Vienna Austria, April 2004). Strom's most recent book, written in collaboration with his wife, Elizabeth Schwartz, is \\"A Wandering Feast: A Journey Through the Jewish Culture of Eastern Europe\\" (Jossey-Bass Publishers, January 2005). Strom's book \\"The Absolute Complete Klezmer Songbook\\" (2006, Transcontinental Music) comes with a CD as well called Absolutely Klezmer Vol I and contains 313 known and rare klezmer melodies, many of which were collected by Strom during his years of field research. His first children's book \\"The Wedding That Saved a Town\\", illustrated by Jenya Prosmitsky, was published by Kar-Ben Publishing in 2008 and won the San Diego Library Association's Best Illustrated Children's book award in 2009. His biography of klezmer clarinetist David Tarras, \\"Dave Tarras: The King of Klezmer\\" (Or-Tav Publications, 2010) is the first full biography of Tarras, authorized by the Tarras family and includes 28 Tarras melodies, many of which have never before been published or recorded, as well as rare family archival photos and biographical details. =Film= Strom has directed five award-winning documentary films (At the Crossroads, The Last Klezmer, Carpati: 50 Miles, 50 Years, L'Chayim, Comrade Stalin! and Klezmer on Fish Street) and has composed music for others. He was the first documentary filmmaker in history to be given his own run at Lincoln Center's prestigious Walter Reade Theatre, where The Last Klezmer broke box office records; this record was only exceeded by Carpati's run there. Both films went on to strong theatrical runs both in the U.S. and abroad, and were featured on major Top Ten Lists (The Last Klezmer on the N.Y. Post's for 1994, and Carpati on the San Diego Union Tribune's for 1997). The Last Klezmer was short-listed for an Academy Award. Klezmer on Fish Street won the 2003 Palm Beach International Film Festival's Special Jury Selection award. His documentary A Man From Munkacs: The Gypsy Klezmer was produced by Duna Television (Budapest, Hungary). Two edits exist, the producer's cut to be shown exclusively in Hungary, and the director's cut for other countries. In 2007, Strom curated an event in New York City, A Great Day on Eldridge Street, a photo shoot (by photographer Leo Sorel) of over 100 of the world's leading klezmer and Yiddish artists (based on the iconic photos \\"A Great Day in Harlem\\"), a parade through the Lower East Side and concerts. Strom's short film, A Great Day on Eldridge Street, documents these events. =Photo exhibitions= Strom's solo photo exhibit, \\"The Rom of Ridgewood\\", about Gypsy communities in Queens, New York, was mounted at the Queens Museum of Art; he has had numerous solo exhibits (depicting Jewish and Rom life) throughout the U.S. and Europe (complete exhibition list upon request). His solo exhibit of portraits of klezmer musicians (Jewish and Roma) in Bessarabia, \\"Klezmorim\\", was exhibited in Romania and Hungary. This same exhibition just recently was at the Jewish Community Center in Houston. His photos are part of many collections including Beth Hatefusoth, The Skirball Museum, The Jewish Museum of NYC, The Frankfurt Jewish Museum and the Museum of Photographic Arts. =Plays= Strom's original stage play, \\"‚Ä¶from man‚Ä¶ to beast‚Ä¶ to crawling thing‚Ä¶\\", was given a fully staged workshop in June 2001 by the Streisand Festival (La Jolla, California). His play, \\"The Education of Hershl Greenshpan\\" (formerly, \\"Verdigris\\") was workshopped by the San Diego Rep, North Coast Rep as well as in New York City, Connecticut and Los Angeles. Strom was featured in the May 31, 2004 issue of Time for this play, and the scholarship behind it. In collaboration with wife and partner Elizabeth Schwartz and author Ellen Kushner, Strom co-wrote the audio drama, \\"The Witches of Lublin\\" (2011), starring Tovah Feldshuh, and featuring Simon Jones, Barbara Rosenblat and Neil Gaiman, among others. He also composed the original music for the recording. =Lectures and teaching= Strom has lectured extensively throughout the United States, Asia and Europe and taught at the Gallatin School of Individualized Study at NYU for 4 years, where he created the course \\"Artist-Ethnographer Expeditions\\". He is on the advisory board of the Center for Jewish Creativity, based in Beverly Hills, California. Since 2006, he has been an Artist-in-Residence in the Jewish Studies Program at San Diego State University, a position created for him. Strom was the first klezmer violinist in history to be invited to instruct master classes at both the American String Teachers Association and the Mark O'Connor fiddle camp, a position that continues.

William Henry Claflin Jr. (8 June 1893 ‚Äì 4 March 1982) was a wealthy American businessman and amateur archaeologist. He did archaeological work in Utah and at Stallings Island in Georgia. The Peabody Museum at Harvard University houses a large collection that Claflin collected and donated. Biography William (Bill) H. Claflin was born in 1893 in Swampscott, Massachusetts to William Henry Claflin and Carrie Avery Claflin. Bill Claflin attended Noble and Greenough School for Harvard College, graduating in 1915 with his A.B. In 1917, he married Helen Atkins of Belmont, Massachusetts. After World War I Clafin served as the head coach for his alma mater's ice hockey team. During his four-year tenure Clafin and George Owen were credited with orchestrating the first line change in an organized game, a maneuver which is still commonplace as of 2020. Bill Claflin's business achievements include acting as the president of the Boston Stock Exchange (1935‚Äì1936), president of the Soledad Sugar Company, treasurer of Harvard College (1938‚Äì1948) and director of many companies and banks. Claflin also served as trustee of the Rockefeller Institute and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Claflin was a Resident Member of the Massachusetts Historical Society and Charter Member of the Massachusetts Archaeological Society. In the late 1920s, Claflin and Raymond Emerson were sent on a pack trip by the Peabody Museum at Harvard University. The Claflin-Emerson Expedition mission was to discover archaeological sites in Utah west and north of the Colorado River. From 1928 to 1931, Claflin and Emerson financed their own research around the Green River, Nine Mile Canyon in Utah and the Fremont River in Utah. Claflin made intermittent trips to Georgia over the years and conducted several minor excavations at Stallings Island and in the middle Savannah River Valley. In 1929, Claflin financed an expedition led by Cornelius Cosgrove and his wife Harriet Cosgrove to Stallings Island in Columbia County, Georgia. Claflin's explorations in the middle Savannah River Valley, Georgia led to the discovery of 140 banner stones, of which 71 are from Stallings Island. Many of the materials collected at Stallings Island and on his southwestern expeditions are housed at the Peabody Museum. In 1932, the Peabody Museum published Claflin's report, \\"The Stallings Island Mound, Columbia County, Georgia\\". An avid explorer, Claflin visited more than 77 countries in his life. He maintained a small archaeological and ethnological museum at his home in Belmont, Massachusetts with more than 34,000 artifacts from his travels and excavations. Claflin died in 1982, at the age of 89, in Belmont. See also * Claflin family References *\\"The Waring Papers: the Collected Works of Antonio J.

The new colony, like its predecessors, did not have responsible government, and while its debates and resolutions carried considerable weight, executive power remained in the hands of the governor, who at the time of the council's founding was Frederick Seymour. There were three groups of members: five senior officials of the colony, who also constituted its executive council, nine magistrates (some of whom, being popular in their districts, had been elevated to that post so as to please Whitehall's intent that there be a more democratic presence in the council), and nine elected members. The electoral members represented two seats in Victoria, one in Greater Victoria (\\"Victoria District\\"), New Westminster, Columbia River and Kootenay, Nanaimo, Yale and Lytton, Lillooet, Cariboo.

They are altered subsurface soil layers that restrict water flow and root penetration. Fragipans are similar to a duripan in how they affect land-use limitations. In soil descriptions, they are commonly denoted by a Bx or Btx symbol. They often form in loess ground.Smalley,I.J.,Davin,J.E. 1982. Fragipan horizons in soils: a bibliographic study and review of some of the hard layers in loess and other materials. New Zealand Soil Bureau Bibliographic Report 30, 122p The first record of fragipans is probably that by John Hardcastle in New Zealand in the 1880s.Hardcastle,J. 1889. Origin of the loess deposit of the Timaru plateau. Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute 22, 406-414, also Loess Letter 71,www.loessletter.msu.edu Characteristics The Required Characteristics of a fragipan according to the \\"Keys to USDA soil taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006\\" are #The layer is 15-cm or more thick; and #The layer shows evidence of pedogenesis within the horizon or, at a minimum, on the faces of structural units; and #The layer has very coarse prismatic, columnar, or blocky structure of any grade, has weak structure of any size, or is massive. Separations between structural units that allow roots to enter have an average spacing of 10 cm or more on the horizontal dimensions; and #Air-dry fragments of the natural soil fabric, 5 to 10 cm in diameter, from more than 50 percent of the layer slake when they are submerged in water; and #The layer has, in 60 percent or more of the volume, a firm or firmer rupture-resistance class, a brittle manner of failure at or near field capacity, and virtually no roots; and #The layer is not effervescent in dilute HCl. What this means in plain English is #The fragipan has to meet a certain thickness requirement. #There needs to be evidence that the fragipan formed from altered parent material, as opposed to being simply undeveloped dense subsoil. #The layer cannot have been altered by plant roots, which would result in granular soil structure, and plant roots are unable to penetrate the fragipan except along intermittent cracks. #The requirement that a fragipan can slake in water separates it from a Petrocalcic Horizon and a duripan. #Fragipans are very hard, even when thoroughly wet, to the extent that roots cannot penetrate. #A fragipan does not contain calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate, which would make it a Petrocalcic Horizon. Genesis The genesis of fragipans is open to considerable debate. Soil scientists often argue over the definition of fragipans and whether or not fragipans exist in certain landscapes. Their formation can be attributed to compacting of soils by glaciers during the last ice age, physical ripening, permafrost processes, or other events that occurred in the pleistocene age. Some fragipans inherit their properties from buried soils called paleosols. It has been proposed that fragipans form by hydroconsolidation, that is the collapse of the soil structure due to loading and wetting.Assallay,A.M.,Jefferson,I.,Rogers,C.D.F.,Smalley,I.J. 1998.

Cuba was discovered by Christopher Columbus a few days after he arrived to the New World in 1492. In 1511, colonization began when the Conquistador Diego Vel√°zquez de Cu√©llar established the Catholic Church in Cuba with the early priest Fray Bartolom√© de las Casas known commonly as \\"the Protector of the Indians\\".Ramos, Marcos A. Protestantism and Revolution in Cuba. Miami: University of Miami, 1989. 19 Along with Catholicism, Protestantism came during the same time. Catholicism was established early while Protestantism came later. \\"Protestantism did not permanently take hold in Cuba until the nineteenth century, though since the sixteenth century the country had been constantly visited by pirates, corsairs and filibusters, many of whom were Protestants\\".Ramos, Marcos A. Protestantism and Revolution in Cuba. Miami: University of Miami, 1989. 20 In Cuba, the roots of Protestantism occurred around the same time as Christianity. The denominations of Catholicism and Protestantism have a significant influence in Cuban history. Catholicism in Cuba during the colonial period 1498‚Äì1898 In 1512, Roman Catholicism came to Cuba with the Dominicans being the first Catholic priests and the Franciscans coming years later. The indigenous people were murdered as early as 1516: the bishop at the time Fray Bernardo de Mesa used lunar cycles and geographical situation as the reasoning for slavery of the Indians.Kirk, John M. Between God and the party: religion and politics in revolutionary Cuba. Tampa: University of South Florida Press, 1989. 4 Eventually the Indigenous Cubans were killed off with many Cubans being descendants of Spanish and African origin. Originally Catholicism catered to the Spanish because the Native Amerindians were killed as opposed to being converted.Melton, J. Gordon, and Clifton L. Holland. \\"Cuba.\\" Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices. Ed. J. Gordon Melton and Martin Baumann. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2010. 833 Pope Leo X (r. 1513-1521) established the Diocese of Baracoa, which included \\"all of Cuba\\" and the Spanish possessions of Louisiana and Florida. The name was changed to the Diocese of Santiago de Cuba in 1522. Catholicism during this period was important because of the engagement in various aspects of life: baptisms, marriages, and funerals. The church fought the buccaneers and combated immorality.Perez, Louis, Luis Martinez-Fern, D. H. Figueredo. \\"Advisory Board.\\" Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, History, Culture. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2003. 508 Authority of bishops during the colonial period compared to the highest civilian and military authority on the island; Schools and institutions of higher learning were created and administered by Church authorities. Some of the bishops who were involved in education at this time were Bishop Jer√≥nimo de Vald√©s (1705‚Äì29) and Bishop Pedro Agust√≠n Morell de Santa Cruz (1753‚Äì68); the Royal and Pontifical University of Saint Jerome of Havana was inaugurated during Valdes' tenure in 1724.Kirk, John M. Between God and the party: religion and politics in revolutionary Cuba. Tampa: University of South Florida Press, 1989. 11 Throughout the Cuban island, the schools of San Ambrosio and San Francisco de Salles in Havana were established by the church from donations and an increase in church revenue.Perez, Louis, Luis Martinez-Fern, D. H. Figueredo. \\"Advisory Board.\\" Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, History, Culture. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2003. 74 The Catholic Church was pivotal in establishing education as a central pillar of Cuban nationality: > During the early history of Cuba, the Catholic clergy seemed to have been > the principal if not the only agents of education.

Santa > Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2010. 833-834 Aside from education, the Catholic Church made other contributions throughout its early years in Cuba. Many historians consider the Golden Age ‚Äì years 1750 to 1850 ‚Äì to be of tremendous importance.Kirk, John M. Between God and the party: religion and politics in revolutionary Cuba. Tampa: University of South Florida Press, 1989. 12 This period was significant in one aspect because of the increase of clergy. The Catholic Church's golden age in Cuba began with the tenure of Bishop Diego Evelino Hurtado de Compostela along with the first diocesan synod of 1680. The powerful influence in culture and politics, increase of native clergy, along with the multiplication of church building and seminaries marked the golden age. The diversity of the church characterized the golden years. Of the 90 churches in Cuba at this time, half of them were headed by Native Cuban priests.Kirk, John M. Between God and the party: religion and politics in revolutionary Cuba. Tampa: University of South Florida Press, 1989. 1-172. 12 The Church was accepted in the urban centers because prior to this time the Spanish had used religion as a tool to influence the local Indians for the acquisition of wealth.Kirk, John M. Between God and the party: religion and politics in revolutionary Cuba. Tampa: University of South Florida Press, 1989. 9 Protestants in Cuba during the colonial period 1498‚Äì1898 The earliest accounts of Protestants in Cuba were in the 1500s. Protestants were not warmly welcomed in Cuba because of the Catholic Spanish colonization of Cuba. By the mid-1800s, the majority of Cubans had become more indifferent toward religion, while Spanish domination of the island was steadily gaining support from the Catholic clergy.Ramos, Marcos A. Protestantism and Revolution in Cuba. Miami: University of Miami, 1989. 21 However, the richest history of Cuban Catholicism during the colonial period occurred in the 1800s. New immigration laws and other changes brought foreigners from various Protestant nations into Cuba for commerce and diplomacy primarily; the abolition of slavery was the agenda for some Protestants secondarily.Perez, Louis, Luis Martinez-Fern, D. H. Figueredo. \\"Advisory Board.\\" Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, History, Culture. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2003. 523-524 Protestants living in Cuba had religious beliefs that contended with religious rules of the land, but Protestants accommodated to the colonial regime differently. While the 19th century placed Cuba in a more prominent position; the late 1800s particularly gave rise to Protestantism in Cuba. The first year of importance was the year 1866. In New York City, a Cuban expatriate named Juaqu√≠n de Palma founded the St. James Episcopal Church, with a primarily Cuban congregation.Ramos, Marcos A. Protestantism and Revolution in Cuba. Miami: University of Miami, 1989. 22 Cuban Protestants were discriminated against and after the Ten Years' War many Cubans were obliged to move to the United States; it was not until 1878 √©migr√©s returned with certain freedoms promised from the Spanish government due to a peace treaty. Subtle changes were produced in 1869 from the declaration of religious tolerance.Perez, Louis, Luis Martinez-Fern, D. H. Figueredo. \\"Advisory Board.\\" Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, History, Culture. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2003. 524 Reverend Edward Kenney was the first Protestant minister to be given consent to perform religious duties; arriving from the United States, Kenney arrived in 1871 organizing the first Episcopalian mission, but was only allowed to proselytize foreigners due to limitations by colonial authorities. The most significant years of Protestantism in Cuba were in the year 1882 and 1883. These years are important because of the establishment of Cuban Protestantism: > As with the Anglicans and Methodists, the Baptists found their initial > converts working among Cuban exiles in Florida. In 1882, Juaqu√≠n de Palma, > who became a Baptist in Florida, returned to Cuba as a Bible distributor > with the American Bible Society. He was joined in 1883 by colporteurs > Alberto J. D√≠az and Pedro Duarte, who were Episcopalian laymen. Later in > 1883, Diaz established an independent Protestant church in La Havana, which > became Iglesia Bautista Getseman√≠ in 1886 after Diaz became an ordained > Baptist minister in 1885 under the Reverend William F. Wood of Key West, > Florida, and became affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention > (SBC).Melton, J. Gordon, and Clifton L. Holland. \\"Cuba.\\" Religions of the > World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices. Ed. J. Gordon > Melton and Martin Baumann. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, > 2010. 835-856 Religious tolerance until 1886 existed only for foreigners until the Episcopal minister Pedro Duarte went directly to the Spanish Crown citing injustices done to him by local authorities.Ramos, Marcos A. Protestantism and Revolution in Cuba. Miami: University of Miami, 1989. 23 As a result, the Spanish Constitution of 1876 extended to Cuba in 1886.Ramos, Marcos A. Protestantism and Revolution in Cuba. Miami: University of Miami, 1989. 23 The difficulties experienced leads and coincides with the next. Protestantism in Cuba was until 1898 Cuban. The foreign presence after Spain contributed to this change: > In 1898 North American intervention brought full religious lawful equality > to Cuba. The arrival of large numbers of returning Cuban exiles and foreign > missionaries also contributed to a growing number of Protestant churches. > The years following the U.S. intervention were years of sway for the North > American Mission Boards in Cuba‚Ä¶ Their activities were not limited to > organizing churches, but many also invested in founding schools and > hospitals. The large U.S. missionary presence in Cuba to a certain point > eclipsed the original native missionary efforts, and tensions between > foreign and local leaders occurred in virtually every Protestant > denomination. The 20th century would be followed by what would be considered the Americanization of Protestantism.Perez, Louis, Luis Martinez-Fern, D. H. Figueredo. \\"Advisory Board.\\" Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, History, Culture. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2003. 25 References *Kirk, John M.

Tesh moved to WYEZ late in 2016. Stokes became midday host. WEZV/WGTN-FM changed from \\"Your Relaxation Station\\" to \\"Refreshing Favorites\\" including Billy Joel, Elton John and The Eagles, rather than Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, in August 2017. The reason given for the change was a drop of 65 percent in the number of listeners. This also meant the departure of Jim Morgan and midday host Bob Collins as well as the end of the Bob and Jan Natale Show. Delilah began airing September 18. In 2020, WEZV and WYEZ (the former WGTN-FM) changed to adult contemporary with \\"Today's best, yesterday's favorites.\\" Artists include Adele, Justin Bieber, Kelly Clarkson, Lady Gaga, Madonna, Maroon 5, Bruno Mars, Matchbox Twenty, John Mayer, Shawn Mendes, P!nk, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift and Justin Timberlake. Other stations using the call letters Another WEZV was previously owned by Holt Broadcasting, broadcasting over the Lehigh Valley in eastern Pennsylvania from 1973 to 1978 on 95.1 FM. Kalamusic Corporation out of Kalamazoo, Michigan picked up the call sign in 1979. It was operated as an Easy Listening station in Fort Wayne, Indiana (101.7 FM) with its sister station of WEZR on the AM side. The call letters were dropped when the station changed formats around 1990. A year later, Bomar Broadcasting would assume the call letters and broadcast on 95.3 FM out of Lafayette, Indiana until 1998.

Similar to the later Christmas carol The Little Drummer Boy, it tells the story of a juggler turned monk who has no gift to offer a statue of the Virgin Mary except for his ability to juggle well. Upon doing so, he is accused of blasphemy by the other monks, but the statue comes to life and blesses the juggler. It was made into an opera by composer Jules Massenet in 1902 (see Le jongleur de Notre-Dame), but \\"straight\\" dramatic versions have also been produced. Adaptations of the story *The story has been staged for television several times, especially during the days of live TV. The titles used for two early versions were, respectively, Our Lady's Tumbler and The Young Juggler (the second version starring Tony Curtis). *In 1917, children's author and illustrator Violet Moore Higgins published an adaptation titled THE LITTLER JUGGLER and Other French Tales Retoldhttps://archive.org/details/TheLittleJuggler *In 1942, MGM filmed a short subject based on the story, titled The Greatest Gift.

His career peaked in 1902-1912 with several Moscow buildings including the Morozov Hospital, the Merchant Club (now the Lenkom Theatre), Moscow Savings Bank, and the public buildings in Miusskaya Square. He was one of the few architects born in the 1860s who integrated into the Soviet establishment, earning the Order of Lenin for various resort projects and for redesigning the interiors of the Grand Kremlin Palace in the 1930s. Biography =Education= Ivanov-Schitz graduated from the Saint Petersburg Institute of Civil Engineers, which he attended from 1883‚Äì1888, with a gold medal. After a brief tour of Europe, he relocated to Moscow, joining the firm of Max Hoppener and later working for the City of Moscow. Another visit to Europe, in 1893, exposed him to Austrian architect Otto Wagner and his circle, who would form the Vienna Secession group in 1897. =Early career= His first realised design, co-signed by Vladimir Sherwood (Jr.), was an 1889 apartment building at 32 Tverskaya Street, Moscow (destroyed). His early works, such as the orphanage in Devichye Pole (1893), now housing Embassy of Vietnam, belong to the tradition of 19th century eclecticism, and do not stand out among hundreds of similar buildings. Over the first decade of his career, Ivanov-Schitz' style gradually moved towards Greek Revival. Collaboration with Lev Kekushev on his railroad projects and public buildings also exposed Ivanov-Schitz to practical applications of Kekushev's Belgian-inspired variety of Art Nouveau. =Mature works= In 1898-1900 he completed his first landmark building, an office block on the corner of Kuznetsky Most and Petrovka Street. This building, dominated by vertical ribs, was a clear departure from eclecticism. Despite quotations from Greek architecture, it was regarded as unusually modern for its period; professionals called it \\"A Greek sort of Wagner\\" (Nachokina, p. 223). From 1902 to 1903, Ivanov-Schitz formulated his own style, a modest blend of Secession and Greek revival. Unlike the extravagant Belgian Art Nouveau practiced by Kekushev, Ivanov's art appealed equally to financial institutions and charities; in fact, most of his works were undertaken for these two groups of clients: * 1900-1905 Morozov Hospital * 1902-1903 Moscow Savings Bank * 1903-1906 Abrikosov's Nursery in Miusskaya Square * 1903-1906 Vvedensky People's House (destroyed, present-day Zhuravlev Square) After the revolution of 1905, his buildings become more rationalist, yet they clearly belong to the same style: * 1907-1908 Merchant Club (present-day Lenkom Theatre) * 1910-1912 Shanyavsky University in Miusskaya Square * 1910-1914 Courses for the Women in Devichye Pole =Soviet period= Between 1908 and 1928, Ivanov-Schitz was officially employed as the architect of Botkin Hospital in Moscow. He continued active construction work, engaged in various consultancies for the Bolsheviks, and blended well into the new establishment. In 1922-1925, when most architects were unemployed, he had real construction jobs, expanding apartment buildings in Tverskoy Boulevard and the Eye Hospital on the Garden Ring. In the 1930s, Ivanov-Schitz was a lead architect for the Medical-Sanitary Board (–õ–µ—á—Å–∞–Ω—É–ø—Ä), a state institution that catered for the Kremlin elite. He completed various high-profile resorts in Sochi and Barvikha and was allowed to rebuild the halls of the Grand Kremlin Palace so it could seat the assemblies of the Supreme Soviet. In the 1990s, his alterations were torn down and the Palace was rebuilt to the original plans of Konstantin Thon (1794‚Äì1881). Illarion Ivanov-Schitz, received the Order of Lenin. In 1937 he died and was buried with honours at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Gallery Moscow, Rakhmanovsky 2.jpgMoscow Savings Bank, Rakhmanovsky Lane, Moscow.

History WAYS originally signed on February 23, 1977 as WJAL. That August, the call sign became WJXY, a call sign that stayed with the station for many years. WJXY was a daytime-only country music station in the 1970s. An FM frequency at 93.9 was added around 1990, at which time the AM switched to Southern gospel. In 1995, the format changed to adult standards, with most of the music coming from the AM Only satellite format. By this time, the station had a limited nighttime signal.

The Byrne Acquisition Group outlet is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at 94.5 MHz with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 12 kW. The station uses the name \\"Talk 94.5\\". Its studios are located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and its transmitter is located in Plantersville, South Carolina. History In February 1991, WKOA first went on the air on 94.5. The station had been programmed as an all-Oldies station after listener questionnaires appeared in local newspapers asking readers what type of format was needed for a new radio station that was going to be coming in February 1991. The winning format was oldies, though former Top-40 Outlet WSYN-FM Sunny 106.5 had just gone all- oldies in May 1990. The new Koast 94.5 played an odd sort of Oldies, many of which were not heard on Sunny 106.5. The playlist was somewhat small. \\"Dancing Queen\\" by ABBA, \\"Torn Between Two Lovers\\", and \\"Tom Dooley\\" by The Kingston Trio were some of the oldies played over and over again on WKOA-FM. By late 1992, Koast 94.5 was dead and WRNN-FM All Talk took over. The Tom Snyder Radio Show was one of their early shows. The format lasted for almost 8 years on 94.5 FM. In 2000, WRNN-FM \\"Hot Talk 94.5\\", a 6,000-watt station, traded frequencies with WMYB \\"Star 99.5\\", a 25,000-watt station, for a few weeks.

It was developed alongside the open Audi R8R LMP category spyder, prior to being replaced by the all-new Audi R8 in 2000. Development In 1998, when Audi announced its intention to enter the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans, the plan was to enter only an open-cockpit prototype, known as the Audi R8R. However, following the dominant performance of GT1-class cars in the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans, the race organizers, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO), had faced a problem. The GT1 cars had transformed over the past few years from race versions of supercars, as the rules intended, into purpose-built closed cockpit prototypes where one car was modified to be a street legal \\"production\\" showcar as almost an after thought. Though these cars were within the GT1 rules, they were not at all what the ACO had intended for the category. Consequently, the ACO modified classification rules for 1999. In GT ranks, the GT1 category was replaced with the GTS category. The GTS class was far more restrictive on modifications, appearance and meeting a set number of production cars than GT1, but still allowed manufacturers to race sportscars that may otherwise be uncompetitive without major modification. Additionally, in order to address advances and popularity of old GT1 class cars, the ACO created the LMGTP category. The LMGTP category would be for closed cockpit prototypes, which gave a place for the previous GT1 cars, but, under prototype rules now, also freed from certain \\"production car\\" restrictions that they had been under in the GT1 category. Under these new rules, LMGTP closed-cockpit cars, with better aerodynamics than open LMP cars, and freed of the GT1 restrictions, had the very real potential of dominating the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans. Toyota and Mercedes both committed to either modifying existing cars or building brand new cars to take advantage of the new rules. With these developments in mind, Audi decided that it should invest in this new LMGTP class along with the R8R LMP program, hence the appearance of the R8C project. Unlike the R8R, for which Audi had turned to Dallara, they instead looked to Racing Technology Norfolk (RTN) to design and develop the new R8C. RTN assigned Peter Elleray the task, while Tony Southgate consulted on the project. The R8C and R8R both use the 3.6 litre twin- turbocharged V8 engine, but are radically different aerodynamically. While the R8R has a large number of vents placed on the nose, most of the intakes and air exits on the R8C are placed on the sides. The R8C also has thinner wheel arches, partially due to LMGTP rules, at the time, that stipulate the LMGTP cars use thinner tires than the LMP cars in order to off-set the better aerodynamic efficiency, and thus higher top speeds, of the LMGTP cars. Additionally, using a styling feature borrowed from the Toyota GT-One, the inside of the front wheel arches of the R8C are open, so that air does not build up in the wheel wells, and to benefit brake cooling. Like most, if not all other LMGTPs of the time, the cockpit is long, gradually sloping to maximise aerodynamic efficiency. Uniquely, though, the minimum roof height was achieved with the use of raised humps above the driver's position, so that there is a trough down the center of the roof to allow for more air to reach the rear wing. The rear of the car features a boxy, blunt tail that was developed from the improved R8R, however, it is longer in order to better maximize the R8C's aerodynamics. Racing history Unlike the R8R, which was able to complete a full testing program, the R8C was completed late and had very little test time prior to the 24 Hours of Le Mans group test in May. Consequently, the cars suffered numerous setbacks and lacked pace both compared to the R8Rs and overall. The R8Cs were capable of hitting speeds upward of on the Mulsanne Straight, but they lacked handling stability compared to other cars and hence lacked overall speed across a full lap. While the R8Rs managed the 8th and 11th fastest times, the R8Cs could only manage the 22nd and 28th fastest times. Many of the R8Cs' problems stemmed from aerodynamic instability, which, besides creating handling difficulties, was causing a build-up of air underneath the engine cover. This issue caused the R8Cs to lose their rear engine covers on several occasions while at speed. Audi Sport UK was unable to significantly improve the R8Cs in the month between the test and the actual race. Qualifying for the 24 Hours of Le Mans produced very similar results to the test in the case of the R8C. Car no. 10 only qualified 20th, while car no. 9 was even further behind in 23rd. Conversely, the R8Rs were able to qualify 9th and 11th. During the race, both the R8Rs and R8Cs suffered numerous gearbox difficulties, but Audi Sport Team Joest was better able to cope with the issues on the R8Rs compared to Audi Sport UK with the R8Cs. Car no. 9 was forced to drop out of the race after just 55 laps with gearbox woes, while the car no. 10 succumbed to gearbox failure after the midpoint of the race, on lap 198. In contrast, both R8Rs finished the race despite their gearbox difficulties, finishing in 3rd and 4th place, 5 and 19 laps behind the winning car respectively. After Le Mans, Audi decided it would concentrate on only one of the two projects going forward. The dismal performance of the R8C, combined with the exodus of all the other manufacturers from the LMGTP class, led Audi to focus on developing the R8R. This would lead to the Audi R8 (race car), which would win Le Mans a total of 5 times between 2000 and 2005. However, Audi would return to the LMGTP class in 2001 with the Bentley EXP Speed 8. Although similar visually to the R8C, the Bentley EXP Speed 8 was a fresh design other than the Audi engine which powered it and the aerodynamic lessons learned from the R8C. In 2003, the Bentley Speed 8, the evolution of the EXP Speed 8, and, somewhat the spiritual successor of the R8C, won Le Mans. This made the Speed 8 the only car to beat the Audi R8 - the direct evolution of the Audi R8R - at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Only two R8Cs were ever built, chassis #101 (car no. 10) and #102 (car no. 9). Both were raced by Richard Lloyd's Audi Sport UK. The 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans was the only competition in which the R8Cs were entered . Audi would return to a closed-cockpit LMP1 car for 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans in order to best take advantage of new regulations provided by the ACO. The car, the R18, would win the race.

Presently, Marianne Island is uninhabited but is routinely visited by tourists and boaters. For much of the 19th and 20th century, farming and copra production took place on Marianne. There was a former settlement called La Cour, and in 1940 the island had 60 inhabitants. There are a few species of gecko on Marianne, including the La Digue day gecko (Phelsuma sundbergi ladiguensis) and Phelsuma astriata semicarinata. Reportedly, the rare Seychelles paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone corvina) is occasionally spotted on the island.

Lundsberg was founded in 1896 with inspirations from classical English boarding schools, and has approximately 200 students today. The school is run by the Lundsbergs school Foundation, Stiftelsen Lundsbergs skola and is well known for its conservative atmosphere. The school is one of the three elite boarding schools in Sweden. Annual tuition is about ¬£24,000. The cost is subsidized by the state but augmented by parents. The school consists of six dormitories, of which three are boys' dormitories (Forest Hill, Bj√∂rke and Grans√§ter), and three are girls' dormitories (Kl√§tten, Herrg√•rden and Skogshult). History Lundsbergs Boarding School was founded by the businessman William Olsson 30 January 1896. The school at that time was characterized of the ideals to form the future leaders of the country via religious studies in a Spartan environment. The school commenced in Lundsberg's Herrg√•rd. However, as the student number rose more student housing, staff buildings, and sport facilities were built. The Main Building was constructed 1906-1907 under the drawings of the architect Erik Lallerstedts. The current sports field was officially opened 1923 by the then Crown prince of Sweden Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V√§sterbotten. At 1907 the school, which was previously owned by Lundsbergs AB, was handed over to the Lundsbergs School Foundation. Today, the committee of the foundation consists of former students, staff, and legal guardians of current pupils. Lundsberg‚Äôs Church Via a donation the school's church could be built under the drawings of Bror Almquist. H.R.H. Prince Gustaf Adolf laid the first stone at the construction site 6 June 1929 and the Diocesan Bishop J.A. Eklund blessed the area. The Church, connected to the main school building, opened its doors 5 October 1930. The altar is made of green marble and the reredos is designed by the artist and former Lundsberg pupil Peder Jensen. All the Swedish princes who had graduated from the school at the time the church was completed, donated together a glass window for the church designed by Sigvard Bernadotte. The school's museum is in the basement of the church. Today the school church is used for choir practice, church service, and morning gatherings before classes commence, as well as music and theatre lessons. There are four students, two girls and two boys, chosen each year to be Churchwardens. There are also four boys chosen to be Church Bell Ringers. Boarding houses Lundsbergs boarding school has eight houses, six of which are being used today. Each house has its own facilities, customs and traditions, and each compete against each other in a variety of activities for trophies to increase the house's reputation. There are around 220 students currently enrolled at the school, with the vast majority being boarders. The houses are: =Berga= Opened its doors 1924. In 1942, Berga became the Principles House and students were relocated to Skogshult.Lundsbergs skola: matrikel 1896‚Äì1996, uppr√§ttad av styrelsen f√∂r F√∂reningen Gamla Lundsbergare, Stockholm 1997,, p.20 =Bj√∂rke = Was completed 1899 and is the school's third oldest student house. The house was originally boys-only, however Skogshult was renovated during 2014, making Bj√∂rke into a mixed house. Now Bj√∂rke is a boys-only house again. Its colours are red and white. =Forest Hill = Finished 1898 and was the second house built on the school campus. Mary Cooper, the founder William Olsson's sister, decided to name the building Forest Hill at its opening ceremony. Its house colours are black and yellow. =Lill Hill = Forest Hill recently (2019) opened a second house, Called Lill Hill (Small Hill). =Grans√§ter = Was completed 1902. It's often called \\"Royal Grans√§ter\\" because of its former students being Prince Gustaf Adolf (from 1918 to 1924) and Prince Sigvard Bernadotte (from 1918 to 1916). It's a boy's house and competes under the colours white and black. =Herrg√•rden = Herrg√•rden is Lundsberg's oldest house and where the school commenced 1896 with only four students. Herrg√•rden's dining room Kavaljeren, which dates back to the 18th century, has a beam ceiling and biblical paintings made in Dalarna on the wall. Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland, lived at Herrg√•rden from 1926 to 1930. It is currently a girls-only house and its colours are royal blue and yellow. =Kl√§tten = Opened by Prince Bertil 10 September 1953. It was designed to have a corridor system so that in case of war breaking out it could easily transform into a hospital. It is a girl's house but it changed to a mixed house for a short while. Its colours are burgundy and grey. =Skogshult = Was finished 1913 and was then built to be a boys house. 1985 the Annex was built for girls making it the only mixed house at the school. Now Skogshult is a girls' house. One of their alumni is Prince Carl Philip, who lived there from 1996 to 1999. Their house colours are blue and white. Activities = Lundsbergaren= Lundsbergaren is Sweden's oldest school newspaper and started year 1910. It's published four times per year and is edited by the school's editorial team, which consists of current students. The newspaper contains reports from the school, sport results, interviews with staff, and writings from FGL (the association for former students). The newspaper is censored by a member of staff as well as FGL and must follow the school policies. = Sports= Sport and health have been the main emphasis and tradition at the school for over a century, hence the school's motto Mens sana in corpore sano, which translates as \\"a healthy mind in a healthy body\\". Lundsbergs's campus houses a range of sports facilities. Continuously during the year there are several individual sports training and competition between students or between student houses at the school. The school also competes with varsity teams in SIPSI (a sport organisations for Swedish boarding-and private schools), which includes Lundsberg's School, Enskilda gymnasiet, Grennaskolan, Sigtunaskolan Humanistiska L√§roverket, and Viktor Rydberg Gymnasium. 2010 was the first year of Gant Rowing Race, a rowing race between the rival schools Lundsberg Boarding School and Sigtuna Humanistiska L√§roverket. = Arts= Music has, since Lundsbergs's church was built, been a vital part of the education and curricular activities at the school. The school has a student choir as well as a staff choir. Theatre has during the decades developed and become a growing platform at the school. Johan Rabaeus and Sven Lindberg are two alumni famous for acting. Controversy On 28 August 2013, the Swedish School Inspectorate closed the school after recurring problems concerning abuse and bullying. The closure would apply for at least six months. On the evening of 28 August 2013, the boarding school announced that headmaster Staffan H√∂rnberg had been dismissed and that the governing board had offered their resignations. The specific allegations were of older boys burning younger boys with hot irons during hazing. When one was taken to a hospital for treatment, the police were informed and the schools inspectorate was notified. The schools inspectorate's recommendation to discontinue continued funding of the school by the government was reported to be under review. The schools inspectorate completed a lengthy investigation of bullying at the school in April 2013, but after threatening a fine of half a million dollars, a decision was made to continue to allow the school to operate based on its apparent success in overcoming bullying. The decision to close the school was due to the threat of imminent danger to students. Students were required to leave, but special arrangements had to be made for the 17 students whose parents were out of the country. Public allegations of bullying emerged in 2011 with a spate of anonymous calls to the media and to the schools inspectorate. An investigation by The Guardian revealed evidence of a long-standing pattern of bullying. Petter Sandgren, a researcher at the European University Institute in Florence, advanced a theory that the children of new entrants to Sweden's elite, nouveau riches, had broken ranks with the old boy network which had previously suppressed reports of abuse. According to an elderly lady who had worked in the kitchens in the school in the 1950s: > It's like time has stood still since I worked there ‚Äì there is exactly the > same spirit now as there was then, the school still lets the older pupils > harass the younger ones and be cruel to them. > I am so relieved that eyes have been opened and people see it for what it > is. I never saw class society revealed so obviously as at Lundsberg ‚Äì and it > is still the same, like Upstairs Downstairs On September 6 Lundsberg was opened again.

A portion of WRNN-FM's broadcast day is simulcast with 1450 WRNN. History of 94.5 FM In early 1991, 94.1 became WKOA-FM, \\"Coast 94.5\\". The station was all Oldies from the mid-1950s-Mid 1970s. They played many Oldies songs that weren't being heard on WSYN Oldies Sunny 106.5. WKOA aired commercials stating that they had run a poll ad in the Myrtle Beach Sun News asking readers what kind of new radio station that they would like on the Grand Strand. Coast 94.5 claimed that the overwhelming answer was an Oldies station that played a lot of 1950s' and early 1960s' Oldies with old commercials and Old T.V. Theme songs played also. So, Coast 94.5 was born. However, their playlist wasn't really very large with a lot of repeats. By September 1992, the station was all talk WRNN-FM and featured the Tom Snyder Show.

These working opportunities are features of the social welfare (¬ß 19 BSHG: \\"charitable additional work\\").  Aim and conditions  As part of the German Hartz concept to increase employment and to decrease welfare costs, the aim of these working opportunities is to aid the long term unemployed in becoming accustomed to regular work again and thus increase their chances of securing paid employment. In accordance with this aim there are four main conditions. First, the working opportunity is subordinate to other opportunities like recruitment into paid work or subsided work. Second, it has to be proportional. Third, the command to take the working opportunity has to be reasonably certain. According to the German constitution every administrative law which interferes with basic civil rights has to state clearly and exhaustively what the citizen has to do. In this case this is the extent, mode and duration of the working opportunity. Fourth, and last, occupational health and safety have to be maintained.  Additional Cost Compensation  The additional cost compensation jobs are often called pejoratively Ein-Euro-Job (One Euro jobs) by some because the \\"additional cost compensation\\" is about one Euro per hour. It can differ from 1.00 ‚Ç¨ to 2.50 ‚Ç¨. The compensation is not considered a wage, so it is not taken from the unemployment benefit. Nothing is added to the pension calculation like regular working jobs - the pension is calculated by the mean earning. This means that the more people there are working with additional cost compensation the lower the average pension. Furthermore, this means less money to spend for pensions; but, in Germany, welfare pays towards the pension of everyone who is on welfare and able to work.  Statistics  People with working opportunities with additional cost compensation are not unemployed in federal statistic meanings, even though they are reported unemployed at the Bundesagentur f√ºr Arbeit. This is to embellish the unemployment statistic; meaning that people who are forced into these working opportunities with additional cost compensation are not added in official statistic. For example, Germany has about 3,400,000 unemployed people but 5,200,000 that depend on welfare money.

Her fascination for archeology first started when she moved to Silver City, New Mexico, in 1906 with her husband Cornelius. In 1919 the Cosgroves bought land in Grant County, New Mexico and began excavating Mimbres Valley ceramics. The Mimbres Valley has pre-Columbian culture dating from 200AD to 1150AD. The Cosgroves reportedly spent their free time exploring the Mimbres Valley with their son, Burton Cosgrove, Jr. In the 1920s the Cosgroves met Alfred Vincent Kidder (1885‚Äì1963), at the time curator of North American Archeology at Harvard's Peabody Museum. Kidder was extremely impressed with the Cosgroves' amateur archaeological work on Mimbres culture; the Cosgroves were later hired in 1924 by Harvard University's Peabody museum through the help of Kidder. Harriet was among the first women in the field of archeology to be professionally employed. She than began professionally excavating sites for the Harvard Peabody Museum, beginning with an expedition in the Mimbres Valley. The Cosgroves‚Äô first professional archaeology endeavor was to excavate the Swarts Ruin, also known as the Swarts Ranch Ruin. The Swarts Ruin was part of the Mimbres Valley, however cultural artifacts of this area of the site suggest that the culture was only active between 1000AD ‚Äì 1150AD in that area. The Swarts excavation established the Cosgroves as elite Southwestern Archaeologists as well as solidifying their image as a team unit. The site was photographically documented by Cornelius and Harriet made ink drawings of every bowl excavated, totaling over 700 Swarts Ruin pots. In total, nearly 10,000 artifacts were found and chronologically recorded by season. Extremely thorough notes were also taken by Harriet pertaining to room locations on the site, dimensions of these rooms, and the floor's soil type; this was done for all burial sites discovered by the Cosgroves. The finds of the site were published in 1932 as ‚ÄúThe Swarts Ruin: A Typical Mimbres Site in Southwestern New Mexico‚Äù which detailed the findings from 1924‚Äì1927 by season. The excavation was deemed ‚Äúprodigious‚Äù and is still used as the primary reference for Mimbres Scholars. A year prior to the Cosgroves‚Äô work at Stalling island they worked on the Gila River site in New Mexico from 1928‚Äì1929. After being hired by William Claflin, Jr. (an archeologist from Belmont, Massachusetts) the Cosgroves began work on the Stallings island Mound in Columbia County, Georgia. The site however was discovered to not be well preserved due to more recent aboriginal activity. A group of artifacts found at the site were termed the ‚Äústallings island culture.‚Äù The development of this idea of the culture allowed artifacts to be more accurately grouped by age, material, and groups of people. Cornelius discovered fiber-tempered pottery at the site as well as tools of late Archaic-type in great numbers. Through the work of the Cosgroves the Stalling Island Mound was found to be a shell heap rather than a major ceremonial construction like it was previously thought to be. Furthermore, the Cosgroves work at Stalling island was the first stratigraphic analysis of midden in Georgia. The last site the Cosgroves worked on as a team was the Hopi Pueblo of Awatovi in Arizona. Burton Cosgrove died in 1936 during the first year of the project. Harriet returned to the site in 1937 and was placed in charge of the pottery tent on the site. She worked in training students and Indian assistants in the processes of washing, sorting, and cataloging the artifacts. In 1970 at the age of 84 Harriet Cosgrove died.

Origin  The origins of yasak can be traced to a tax collected from native, primarily non-Turkic populations in the Golden Horde. The word yasaq is a Russian variation of the Qazaq/Turk word 'Zhasaq', which has two meanings: First, 'This is what you have to do', from a law decree of that time introduced by the Great Shyngys Khan (Genghis Khan)'. Second is a 'ten-men troop', who were the smallest cell in the army, who also came to collect the tribute of 1/10 of profits in favour of the Altyn Orda (Golden Horde), and their name became the shadow of the tribute and in return stayed in European languages under associative name rather than real definition. There is much uncertainty as to the time when the concept of yasak was introduced in Muscovy. It appears likely that the tax was inherited by Muscovy from the Volga khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan - two fragments of the Golden Horde that were subjugated by Ivan IV in the 1550s. These territories were settled by a range of non-Christian peoples who were expected to pay yasak either in kind or cash. The late French scholar of Eurasian history, Renee Grousset, traces \\"yasaq\\" (Regulations) back still further in his classic work, The Empire of the Steppes, to the moral code imposed by Genghis Khan on his original horde. The Yasaq continued to be practiced by Mongol hordes until they came under Yellow Church Buddhist (Mongolia, China) and Muslim influences (Golden Horde, Persia, Central Asia) in successive centuries. The earliest mention of the tax is found in a letter sent by Ismail (a ruler of the Nogai Horde and ancestor of the Yusupov family) to Tsar Ivan IV in 1559, three years after Ivan's conquest of the Volga Delta and Astrakhan. The border between the two polities was not yet established, and Ismail complained that Ivan's governor of Astrakhan demanded yasak from those inhabitants of the delta that Ismail considered his subjects, \\"in grain from those who farm and in fish from those who fish\\".Quoted from: Khodarkovsky, Michael. Russia's Steppe Frontier: The Making of a Colonial Empire, 1500-1800. Indiana University Press, 2002. . Pages 61-63.  Nature  Voguls delivering a tribute of fur to Yermak Timofeyevich Yasak was gradually introduced in North Asia in the 17th century as a consequence of Russia's conquest of Siberia. The Tsar's relationship with natives was based on the quid pro quo principles. The annual delivery of yasak by the native representatives was normally accompanied by a state-sponsored feast and distribution of royal gifts to the natives. This compensation included tobacco, flints, knives, axes, and other useful tools. Some native populations, especially in the Far East, favoured multi-colored crystal beads. The local voyevoda could also provide the yasak-payers (\\"—è—Å–∞—á–Ω—ã–µ –ª—é–¥–∏\\") with supplies of provisions such as fish oil. When the Tsar failed to deliver due compensation or his presents were deemed insufficient or too cheap, the yasak-payers would voice their discontent. According to one 17th-century report, not only the yasak-gatherers were beaten, but the natives proceeded to \\"throw the sovereign's presents, and tie them onto dog's necks, and throw them into the fire, and they pay yasak with no courtesy, they kick it with their feet and throw it to the ground and the call us, your servants, bad people\\". On several occasions, such conflicts prompted the natives to rise in rebellion against the Muscovite government. It was against this volatile background that the Tsar's officials worked to transform yasak from an exchange of items (the centuries-old concept inherited from the Khanate of Siberia and Golden Horde) into a fixed and regular levy, but the process took centuries to complete. In many frontier areas it turned out that \\"the regular supply of... presents to the local ruler and his nobles was, in fact, the only way to secure the natives' cooperation\\". In the basin of the Volga, yasak was replaced with a regular tax in the 1720s, and most of Siberia followed suit in 1822. A largely symbolic form of yasak continued to be levied from the nomadic peoples of Eastern Siberia (Yakuts, Evenks, Chukchi) until the Russian Revolution of 1917.  Collection  Yasak collection procedures were not strictly regulated and varied considerably from ulus to ulus. A census was required to determine the numbers of yasak-payers, with results recorded in a list of yasak-payers, or \\"yasak-book\\", of which more than 1,700 survive from the 17th century alone. Each male yasak-payer between the ages of 18 and 50 was expected to take a shert, or an oath of allegiance to the Tsar. Most peoples of Siberia paid tribute on a house-to-house basis, but the Yakut people delivered it based on the number of cattle in each household, while the Bashkir people paid yasak on the basis of a land census. Yasak was payable in sables, red foxes, beavers, martens; cattle was also allowed as payment in some circumstances. Yasak payments formed the basis for Russia's fur trade with Western Europe. The Siberian Prikaz was responsible for yasak collection in Muscovite Russia. In 1727, an ukase decreed that yasak could be paid in cash, but this measure was found to be less than profitable for the imperial treasury and, twelve years later, it was revoked. The Cabinet of Ministers then decreed that yasak be paid in sables, or, in the absence thereof, in other furs. Catherine the Great undertook a reform of yasak collection by instituting a number of \\"yasak commissions\\", with the head office located in Tobolsk. In 1827 the task of yasak collection was entrusted to two principal yasak commissions, one for Eastern Siberia and another for Western Siberia, whose activities were regulated by a special statute.

He was married to Harriet, the other half of the dynamic Cosgrove archeology unit. Background In 1919 the Cosgroves bought land in Grant County, New Mexico and began excavating the Mimbres Valley ceramics. The Mimbres Valley has pre-Columbian culture dating from AD 150 to 1250. The Cosgroves reportedly spend their free time exploring the Mimbres Valley with their son, Burton Cosgrove Jr. In the 1920s the Cosgroves meet Alfred Vincent Kidder (1885-1963) who was the curator of North American Archeology at the Peabody Museum at the time. Alfred Kidder was extremely impressed with the Cosgroves' amateur archaeological work on the Mimbres Valley, and because of this the Cosgroves were later hired in 1924 by Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology through the help of Kidder. Work in New Mexico The Cosgroves' first professional archaeology endeavor was to excavate the Swarts Ranch Ruin. The Swarts Ranch Ruin was part of the Mimbres Valley, however cultural artifacts of this area of the site suggest that culture was only active between AD 1000‚Äì1150 in this area. The Swarts excavation established the Cosgroves as elite Southwestern Archaeologists as well as solidifying their image as a team unit . The site was photographically documented by Cornelius and Harriet who made ink drawings of every bowl excavated, totaling over 700 Swarts Ruin pots. In total, nearly 10,000 artifacts were found and chronologically recorded by season. Extremely thorough notes were also taken by Harriet pertaining to room locations on the site, dimensions of these rooms, and the floor‚Äôs soil type; this was done for all burial sites discovered by the Cosgroves. The finds of the site were published in 1932 as ‚ÄúThe Swarts Ruin: A Typical Mimbres Site in Southwestern New Mexico‚Äù which detailed the findings from 1924‚Äì1927 by season. The excavation was deemed ‚Äúprodigious‚Äù and is still used as the primary reference for Mimbres Scholars. A year prior to the Cosgroves‚Äô work at Stallings Island, they worked on the Gila River site in New Mexico from 1928‚Äì1929. With his wife Harriet, he began excavating sites for the Harvard Peabody Museum, beginning with an expedition in the Mimbres River Valley. Work in Georgia In 1929 he and his wife were hired by William Claflin Jr. to work on the Stallings Island site in Columbia County, Georgia. The Cosgroves discovered that the site was not well preserved due to more recent aboriginal activity. A group of artifacts found at the site were termed the \\"Stallings Island culture.\\" The development of this idea of the culture allowed artifacts to be more accurately grouped by age, material, and groups of people. Cornelius discovered fiber-tempered pottery at the site as well as tools of late Archaic-type in great numbers. Through the work of the Cosgroves the Stallings Island mound was found to be a shell heap rather than a major ceremonial construction like it was previously thought to be. The work was the first stratigraphic analysis of midden in Georgia. Death The last site the Cosgroves worked on as a team was the Hopi Pueblo of Awatovi in Arizona. Burton Cosgrove died in 1936 during the first year of the project. References *\\"The Waring Papers: the Collected Works of Antonio J.

History In April 1925, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini agreed to the Fascist unions‚Äô demands to set up the OND, with Mario Giani, a former director of Italian Westinghouse, at its head. The trade unions initially saw the provision of leisure facilities for workers as a way to compete with the Socialists, who already had a network of cultural organizations. The OND originally had an apolitical and productivist image, helping it gain the support of employers. There was nothing \\"inherently fascist\\" about the OND and it had been modelled on institutions like the YMCA. However, in April 1927 Augusto Turati, the Fascist party Secretary, dismissed Giani and became OND leader, turning the OND into an auxiliary of the party. In the 1930s under the direction of Achille Starace the OND became primarily recreational, concentrating on sports and other outings. It is estimated that by 1936 the OND had organized 80% of salaried workers.de Grazia, Victoria. The Culture of Consent: Mass Organizations of Leisure in Fascist Italy. Cambridge, 1981. Nearly 40% of the industrial workforce had been recruited into the Dopolavoro by 1939 and the sports activities proved popular with large numbers of workers. The OND had the largest membership of any of the mass Fascist organizations in Italy.Kallis, Aristotle, ed. (2003). The Fascism Reader, London: Routledge, pages 391-395.  Societal effects  The Dopolavoro had little trouble attracting members, but according to historian Tobias Asbe, while the activities sponsored by the OND were popular with the working class, these activities \\"did not turn workers into ideologically convinced supporters of the Fascist regime.\\"Kallis, Aristotle, ed.

It was premiered by Yehudi Menuhin, to whom it was dedicated, in New York on 26 November 1944. Background Violinist Yehudi Menuhin commissioned a work for solo violin from Bart√≥k in November 1943. It was written in New York and in Asheville, North Carolina, where Bart√≥k underwent treatment for leukemia. Bart√≥k finished composing the piece in March 1944. He wrote letters to Menuhin in April and June 1944 to agree on minor changes to make the Sonata easier to play. Structure and analysis The Sonata consists of four movements: The Tempo di ciaccona is essentially a sonata-form movement written somewhat in the style of a chaconne, even though it is not its form. It is full of typical Hungarian folk intervals and harmonies. The Fuga begins with a four-voice fugue on a pulsating, staccato melody. After a section where the melody is accompanied quietly with fast running notes, it returns as a series of chords, alternately played with the bow and plucked in inversion. Nevertheless, it is not a strict fugue, as every episode introduces new material to the subject. The Melodia begins with a lyrical melody, stated alone and in all different registers of the instrument. It continues in sixths, octaves, and tenths, accompanied by trills and tremolos. The Presto alternates between a very quiet, fast, bumblebee-like passage played with a mute, and a cheerful melody. Bart√≥k originally wrote the rapid passages in quarter-tones, but many violinists choose to perform a version, suggested by Menuhin, that only uses the standard 12 notes of Western classical music. Three contrasting themes appear throughout this movement, all of which re-appear in the final coda. The Solo Sonata presents violinists with many difficulties and uses the full gamut of violin techniques: several notes played simultaneously (multiple stops), artificial harmonics, left-hand pizzicato executed simultaneously with a melody played with the bow, and wide leaps between pitches.

The Han imperial regime required Ferghana horses and imported such great numbers of them that the rulers of Ferghana closed their borders to such trade. That move resulted in a war that China won. In 102 CE, the Chinese required of the defeated Ferghana that they provide at least ten of their finest horses for breeding purposes, and three thousand Ferghana horses of ordinary quality.Fleitmann, p. 39 However, there are other views: the Records of the Grand Historian and Book of Han provide no description of Ferghana horses, and as it seemed from these chronicles they were not employed in any known Han expeditions and campaigns. Chinese statuary and paintings, as well as the Bactrian coin shown above, indicate that these horses had legs that were proportionally short, powerful crests, and round barrels. The forelegs of the Chinese depictions are very straight, resembling the Guoxia horse of present-day China. According to tradition, these horses sweat blood, giving rise to the name: \\"sweats blood horse\\" (in ). Modern authorities believe that blood-sucking parasites caused sweat to get mixed with blood when the horses were worked. > Modern researchers, Mair notes, have come up with two different ideas [for > the ancient Chinese references to the \\"Blood-sweating\\" horses of Ferghana]. > The first suggests that small subcutaneous blood vessels burst as the horses > sustained a long hard gallop.

P. multipapillosa is thought to have been the cause of the \\"blood-sweating\\" of these famous and much desired horses from Ferghana, which Emperor Wu of Han China (Wudi) renamed \\"Heavenly Horses\\" (c. 113 BCE). He sent an army of 40,000 men in 104 BCE 5,000 km to Ferghana, but less than half the army reached their destination. Exhausted, they were defeated. Another army of 60,000 men was sent in 103 BCE and who breached the walls of the city and cut off the water supply after a 40 day siege. Fearing imminent defeat, the inhabitants beheaded their king and presented his head to the Han general and offered the Han to take as many horses as they wanted. After installing a new puppet King, the Han left with 3,000 horses, although only 1,000 remained by the time they reached China in 101 BCE. The Ferghana also agreed to send two Heavenly horses each year to the Emperor, and lucerne seed was brought back to China providing superior pasture for breeding raising fine horses in China, to provide cavalry which could cope with the Xiongnu who threatened China.Watson (1961), p. 135.Boulnois (2004), pp. 82‚Äì83.

He is best known for his association with Nobel laureate, Albert Einstein. Biography Maurice Solovine was born in Ia»ôi, a university city in eastern Romania, near the border with Moldova. As a young student of philosophy in Bern, Solovine applied to study physics with Albert Einstein in response to an advertisement. The two men struck up a close relationship and Einstein was said to say to Solovine a few days after meeting him: \\"It is not necessary to give you lessons in physics. The discussion about the problems which we face in physics today is much more interesting; simply come to me when you wish. I am pleased to be able to talk to you.\\" One day Solovine suggested reading and debating the works of great authors. Einstein agreed enthusiastically and soon mathematician Conrad Habicht (1876-1958) became involved in what was to be known as the \\"Akademie Olympia\\" (Olympia Academy). Often their meetings, held in Einstein's flat, would last until the early morning hours. On one occasion Solovine missed a scheduled meeting in his flat, preferring to listen to a concert in the city. He had prepared a meal for his friends with a note: \\"Amicis carissimis ova dura et salutem.\\" (To the beloved friends, hard-boiled eggs and greetings). However Einstein and Habicht turned his flat upside down after they had eaten the meal. Every piece of furniture was moved and plates, cups, forks, knives and books were scattered all over the flat. The rooms were also covered in smoke from Einstein‚Äôs pipe and Habicht‚Äôs cigar. They left a \\"worthy warning\\" on the wall. There you could read: \\"Amico carissimo fumum spissum et salutem.\\" (To the dearest friend, thick smoke and greetings). Einstein is reputed to have greeted Solovine the next evening with the following words: \\"You lousy guy, how, you were cheeky enough to stay away from a meeting of the Akademie to listen to the violin? Barbarian, idiot, stupid one, if you ever let us down this way again you‚Äôll be expelled from the Akademie with shame.\\" This meeting lasted until the morning to make up for lost time. Solovine remained in contact with Einstein into the 1950s. He died in Paris. References * Maurice Solovine (ed.)

During this time in 1988, the WSYN-FM Sunny 106.5 studios were moved to a small Frontage Road Studio off of U.S. Highway 17 By-Pass in Surfside Beach (next door to the offices of Clearview Cable TV that then became Jones Intercable in late 1988). The move of the studios to Surfside Beach and the name change to Sunny 106.5 generated a huge advertising campaign in the local media and a newly designed Sunny 106.5 logo. The staff of veteran Myrtle Beach broadcasters included Tom Brockway (mornings) and \\"Kahuna\\" (afternoons). The station was consulted by legendary consultant Tom Collins.

Less than two weeks after WYAK's re-incarnation as WLFF, Cumulus changed WLFF to 106.5 The Coyote.

Local monuments include the ruined Clonmore Castle, Rath Gall hilltop ring fort, Labbanasighe megalithic tomb in Moylisha and Saint Finian's monastery at Aghowle. Mount Wolsley Hilton golf course is 8 km away at Tullow and Rathwood Home and Garden Centre is 3 km away. Sport =Coolkenno GAA = The hurling club \\"Killinure Emmets\\" were the earliest starters of hurling around the Shillelagh district. Coolkenno are believed to have represented the area as well as Ballyraheen and Derry Rovers. From the beginning of the century ‚ÄúShillelagh‚Äù dominated as the name of the district team. In 1890 Crecrin Harps played Graiguecullen in the County Carlow final. In 1897 Killinure arrived and beat Shillelagh in their first match. The team was also present in 1913 as well but the club disappeared again in late 1914. After the 1921 War of Independence treaty the team restarted and in 1924 it was beaten by Rathdangan in the County Junior Football Final. The club eventually fizzled out due to a decrease of young players and emigration from Killinure and Coolkenno. The present club in Coolkenno was founded in November 1980, after a meeting in the Crablane pub by local Gaelic football enthusiasts. It took a seventeen years for major success when the club won its first county title, the Junior B Football Championship, in Baltinglass in December 1997. Coolkenno later won the county intermediate title in 2002, beating St. Pats of Wicklow Town in the county final at Aughrim. A new football pitch was completed in 2003-2004 and holds a clubhouse and gym. In 2010, Coolkenno joined ranks with Shillelagh G.F.C to re-create the 1946 St. Mary's team. The team won the Wicklow Senior Championship in its very first season in late 2011. Coolkenno also has produced players for the Wicklow Senior Team under Mick O'Dwyer such as Don Jackman of Knockeen, Paddy Dalton of Rath, Eamon Rossiter of Coolkenno and Steven Cushe of Rath East.

Several artists and writers have worked on the series but the most popular version is that drawn by Will, with writers Maurice Rosy, Maurice Tillieux and Stephen Desberg. The strip first started in 1938 and lasted until 1997, just one year short of its 60th birthday. Main characters Tif and Tondu are adventurers and detectives who solve cases around the world, from the United States to the Congo. The central irony of the series' title was that the two friends had names which actually better suited the other: * Tif is French slang for \\"hair\\" yet the character is bald-headed and clean-shaven. He also tends to be more reckless and has an eye for the ladies. * Tondu is the French for \\"sheared\\" but he wears thick hair and beard. He is also more level-headed and is the brains of the partnership. He often takes up journalism when short of money. Publication history =The beginning= The series made its debut on 21 April 1938 in the first issue of Spirou magazine as Aventures de Tif, written and drawn by Fernand Dineur. Within a few issues Tif had made the acquaintance of Tondu, a shipwrecked sea captain, and the two joined forces, traveling the world in search of adventure.Dictionnaire mondial de la Bd (World Dictionary of Comics) by Patrick Gaumer and Claude Moliterni, , In 1949, Dineur passed the drawing over to Will, but continued to provide the scenarios for the next three years before retiring from the strip. At this time, their adventures were also published in H√©roic Albums, drawn by Dineur. Another artist, Marcel Denis, also contributed a handful of stories in the early 1960s. Will himself worked on the strip for almost 40 years in collaboration with various writers. This period, kept together by his distinctive drawing and handling of the characters, is seen as the strip's golden age. =The golden age and Monsieur Choc= Will's first strips post-Dineur were short-lived collaborations with writers Henri Gillain (aka Luc Bermar) and Albert Desprechins (aka Ben), but then Maurice Rosy came along and worked on the strip till 1968. It was Rosy who created one of the series' most memorable characters: the villain Monsieur Choc. Monsieur Choc (in English it would be \\"Mister Shock\\") was the leader of a major criminal organisation called \\"La Main blanche\\" (\\"the White Hand\\"). His habitual outfit was a tuxedo and a knight's helmet which covered his head. His true identity was never revealed. When he did not wear his helmet he used face-masks, make-up or bandages. In one adventure it was only in the very last panel that Tif and Tondu discovered that it was Choc that they had been fighting all along. On one occasion, in a short story published in 1976, Tif and Tondu did get to see a photo of Choc's face, but it was not of much use since it was one of him as a sweet little baby ! Choc came up with increasingly fanciful ways of taking over the world. These included a giant robot (Le R√©veil de Toar, 1966), the manipulation of dreams (Le Grand combat, 1967) or becoming invisible (Traitement de Choc, 1984). Other characters from this period included the young Countess Am√©lie d'Yeu (known as Kiki), Inspector Ficshusset of Scotland Yard and Inspector Allumette of the French S√ªret√©, who ably led the official struggle against Choc. In accordance with the attitude of French censors of the time, who disapproved of bungling police officers, Allumette (whose name means \\"matchstick\\") was treated respectfully; in fact he was often shown as a step ahead of even Tif and Tondu. Rosy was succeeded by Maurice Tillieux (from L'ombre sans corps on) who brought to the series the mixture of humour and mystery that he had employed in others such as Gil Jourdan. Tillieux died in a car crash in 1978 and his assistant Stephen Desberg took over (from Le gouffre interdit on). Desberg used the strip to highlight more political and social issues: the use of cheating in sport for monetary gain (√âchecs et match!, 1981); the world-wide reach of organised crime (Dans les griffes de la main blanche, 1986); and the influence of the extreme right-wing in the south of France (Les Phalanges de Jeanne d'Arc, 1987, and La Tentation du bien, 1989). Desberg also reintroduced the character of Choc who had been noticeably absent during the Tillieux period. =The decline= In 1990, Will and Desberg turned to other projects. Starting with Prise d'otages, writer Denis Lapi√®re and artist Alain Sikorski took over, turning the strip into a more mundane detective series. After saving the world on several occasions, Tif and Tondu were now simple, everyday private detectives with an office in Paris. Tondu also married a girl called Mona. Their investigations focused mainly on such cases as fraud, forgery, murder and kidnapping. At their best, the stories looked at aspects of police procedure and that of other emergency services, but there was still little of the high-profile confrontations of the Will era. The strip ended in 1997 and there appears to be little hurry to relaunch it. So far Spirou has been content to republish stories from the Will period, including Tif and Tondu's first encounter with Mister Choc, which coincided with the Dupuis publication of an omnibus edition of their early adventures with their sworn enemy. Bibliography Although the adventures of Tif and Tondu date back to 1938, only the ones dated from 1954 onwards are available in book form ‚Äî this being its most popular period. =Original Albums= # La villa Sans-souci # Le tr√©sor d'Alaric, 1954 # Tif et Tondu en Am√©rique centrale, 1954 # Oscar et ses myst√®res, 1955 # Tif et Tondu contre la main blanche, 1956 # Le retour de Choc, 1958 # Passez muscade, 1958 # Plein gaz, 1959 # Tif et Tondu (in Bibor et Tribar), 1960 # La villa du Long-Cri, 1966 # Choc au Louvre, 1966 # Les fl√®ches de nulle part, 1967 # La poup√©e ridicule, 1968 # Le reveil de Toar, 1968 # Le grand combat, 1968 # La mati√®re verte, 1969 # Tif rebondit, 1969 # L'ombre sans corps, 1970 # Tif et Tondu contre le cobra, 1971 # Le roc maudit, 1972 # Sorti des ab√Æmes, 1972 # Les ressucit√©s, 1973 # Le scaphandrier mort, 1974 # Un plan d√©moniaque, 1975 # Tif et Tondu √† New York, 1975 # Aventure birmane, 1976 # Le retour de la b√™te, 1977 # Le gouffre interdit, 1978 # Les passe-montagnes, 1979 # M√©tamorphoses, 1980 # Le sanctuaire oubli√©, 1981 # Echecs et match, 1982 # Swastika, 1983 # Traitement de Choc, 1984 # Choc 235, 1985 # Le fant√¥me du samoura√Ø, 1986 # Dans les griffes de la main blanche, 1986 # Magdalena, 1987 # Les phalanges de Jeanne d'Arc, 1988 # La tentation du bien, 1989 # Coups durs, 1991 # Prise d'otages, 1993 # A feu et √† sang, 1993 # L'assassin des trois villes soeurs, 1995 # Les vieilles dames aux cent maisons, 1995 # Fort cigogne, 1996 # Le myst√®re de la chambre 43, 1997 =Omnibus= # Le diabolique M.Choc, 2007 # Sur la piste du crime, 2007 # Sign√© M.Choc, 2008 # Echec au Mystificateurs, 2008 # Choc m√®ne la dance, 2009 # Horizons Lointains, 2009 In popular culture The character of Monsieur Choc might have been the inspiration behind Benedict,Benedict profile at internationalhero.co.uk the main character of Gary Gianni's Monstermen comic series (nowadays known as Corpus Monstrum), first published as a back-up to Mike Mignola's Hellboy in 1994.

Career Pooley was previously at Millwall, making one senior appearance for the club in a Championship game against Burnley in April 2006. Sean Connor signed him for Bohemians where he did enough in pre-season games to be offered a contract. He made his league debut starting in centre midfield against Drogheda United in March 2007. He scored his first goal for Bohs in a League Cup game against Cork City on 3 July 2007. However, when his contract ended at the end of the 2007 season, Pooley was released by Bohs. On 30 January 2007, manager Tommy Wright swooped to sign Pooley on a short-term deal until the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season. After a couple of appearances Pooley was released after the club and player mutually agreed to terminate the contract. In August 2008, Pooley joined Conference National outfit, Ebbsfleet United on a one-year contract. This was extended by a further year following a fund raising appeal by Ebbsfleet manager Liam Daish to the owners of the club. Dean was released by Ebbsfleet in May 2011. On 13 June 2011, manager Chris Kinnear signed Pooley for Margate. He became Kinnear's first signing in his second spell in charge at the club. On 13 August 2013, he signed for Conference South side Bromley. Pooley scored his first goal for the club in a 3‚Äì2 away win over Concord Rangers on 17 September 2013.

It was raced alongside the British built closed-cockpit Audi R8C. Development The R8R project began in 1997, when Audi began research into entering the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The first prototype was displayed in 1998, showing an open cockpit car which featured many Audi styling cues, yet lacked some of the practical necessities for sports car racing. The car, designed by Michael Pfadenhauer and Wolfgang Appel and built by Dallara, featured an Audi 3.6 litre twin-turbo V8 engine. Styling features included a large group of aerodynamic vents in the nose, as well as high sidepods which featured NACA ducts on their tops to feed the turbochargers. A large vent on the side also allowed air out from the front wheel well. By the car's debut at the 1999 12 Hours of Sebring, the aerodynamics were evolved. A longer tail was prominent, with the wheel arches more subtly curved into the side pods, instead of an abrupt hard-edge design. The front end was also lower, and featured more aerodynamic styling over the original stylized prototype. However, following Sebring, further testing was done on the R8R in order to better improve its overall speed in preparation for Le Mans. The front bodywork was further evolved, with a wider and more curved sidepod being used. The NACA ducts were also replaced with a vertical air inlet coming out of the side fender. The tail was also shortened, and aerodynamic elements were added to the styling of the sidepods. Only five R8Rs would be built total. #204 and #205 would run Sebring only in 1999, while #307 and #308 would run Le Mans. #306 would be added in 2000 to compete in the American Le Mans Series. Lessons learned from the R8R would be later evolved into the R8 for 2000. Racing history Following months of testing, the R8R made its racing debut at the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1999. Run by Joest Racing of Germany, the R8Rs showed some initial difficulties in qualifying, managing to set merely the 11th and 12th fastest times. However, during the race, the cars showed their durability by being able to outlast most of the competitors who had initially outpaced them. Even though the also new BMW V12 LMR suffered some problems, one of their entries was far superior in terms of pace and reliability. Following twelve hours though, R8Rs were successful in taking a podium with a 3rd-place finish, while the other team car managed 5th. Following Sebring, the R8Rs returned to testing, joined by the new R8Cs. At Le Mans testing in May, the R8Rs were able to go up against the bulk of the major manufacturers for the first time. The Audis showed their pace by taking the 8th and 11th fastest lap times over the test, beating competitors such as Mercedes-Benz and Nissan. For the race itself, the R8Rs would again show their reliability. Although they managed to qualify 9th and 11th, they managed to outlast the bulk of their competitors from Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Panoz, Nissan, and BMW. In the end, the R8Rs managed to come home in a respectable 3rd and 4th places, again scoring a podium. They were beaten by a single BMW yet again, as well as one of the Toyota GT-Ones. Following the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans, Audi had to decide which of the two prototypes they'd continue to work on into 2000. The R8Cs, which failed to finish at Le Mans and showed a lack of pace in comparison to the R8Rs, were scrapped. The R8R would be further evolved into an all-new prototype known simply as the Audi R8, sharing nothing mechanical or stylistic from the R8 except for the engine. However, although the R8 made its debut at the 12 Hours of Sebring in 2000, the car was returned to Europe by Audi to conduct more testing for that year's Le Mans. This left the older R8R to return to the American Le Mans Series to compete in the next two rounds of the season, the Grand Prix of Charlotte and Silverstone 500. At Charlotte, R8R managed to 6th place behind the duo of BMWs and the improved Panoz, although the second R8R suffered mechanical woes and finished well down the order. For Silverstone, the two R8Rs would perform better, again taking a podium finish. Beaten once again by BMW and Panoz, the R8Rs would take 3rd and 4th places. Following Silverstone, the R8Rs were retired permanently as the new R8s would race for the rest of the American Le Mans Series season. The R8R is estimated to boast around from its V8 engine, allowing it to hit in 1999 at Le Mans (the original claims were that the car could go ).

Lott, Jr., author of previous works More Guns, Less Crime and The Bias Against Guns. Freedomnomics takes an economic look at the effects of the free market, and presents some arguments against those found in Freakonomics by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. The publications The American and National Review ran positive reviews, with critic Robert VerBruggen stating that Lott \\"renders lots of charts, graphs and statistical analysis into clear, uncomplicated conversation.\\" In the book, Lott argues that right-to-carry laws in the U.S. have contributed to reduced rates of gun violence, that the public availability of abortion causes a rise of illegitimacy, and that female suffrage has led to government growth, among other viewpoints. Lott generally takes a conservative and libertarian perspective.  Background  Lott had previously sued Freakonomics co-author Steven Levitt for libel, based on Levitt's statement that other researchers \\"haven‚Äôt been able to replicate\\" Lott‚Äôs controversial studies that find that gun deaths decline after concealed-carry laws are put into effect. A judge dismissed Lott's complaint. Readings in Applied Microeconomics: The Power of the Market, a work edited by Craig Newmark and published by the Taylor & Francis Group, later excerpted sections from Freedomnomics in 2009.Readings in Applied Microeconomics: The Power of the Market  Topics  = Academia = In a discussion of incentives, Lott refers to an event at Montana State University when the state proposed to abolish property taxes. Lott asserts that University professors knew that ending the tax was a good economic policy, but opposed the proposed law because it had the potential to reduce government funding to their University.Freedomnomics, pp. 6‚Äì11 = Gas prices = Lott argues that oil and gas companies have incentives to stabilize the prices of gas and that such stability would benefit consumers in the long run. He asserts that the increases in gas prices during Hurricane Katrina actually helped mitigate the adverse impacts of the hurricane. He says that if government price controls, like those of the 1970s, had been enacted, they would have made life much harder for the victims.Freedomnomics, pp. 15‚Äì22 = Drug prices = Lott asserts that Americans pay more for medications than other countries and that the additional expense paid by Americans is used to fund the research necessary to invent those drugs. If Americans did not pay high prices for drugs, he claims, then no new drugs would be created. Lott asserts that government price controls on drugs would destroy medical innovation, not only for the United States, but also for other countries who are dependent on the United States for new drugs.Freedomnomics, pp. 20‚Äì22 = Used car vs. new car prices = Lott argues against the widely held belief that a new car loses 15‚Äì25% of its value as soon as it leaves the new car dealer's lot. He cites published estimates of new and certified used car prices using manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP); Kelley Blue Book prices; and Yahoo! Auto Certified Used prices for 55 certified used cars (15 with less than 5,000 miles and 40 with about 15,000 miles). A few of the cars with less than 5,000 miles were actually worth more than MSRP.Freedomnomics, pp. 35‚Äì39 = Campaign finance reform = Lott claims that laws which limit money donated to politicians gives an advantage to incumbents. He also asserts that these laws redirect money from politicians to political action committees, thereby increasing the occurrence of negative campaigning.Freedomnomics, pp. 40‚Äì82 = Reputation = Lott makes an argument that reputations are an important, and often overlooked, asset in the economy. He gives examples of how hurt reputations can be more damaging than penalties imposed by law. = Professional licensing = Lott asserts that professional licensing prevents the highest quality entrants from entering professions from barbering to practicing law. He points out that even though he has been a university professor for many years, he is not legally able to teach at public high schools in most states because of government regulations.Freedomnomics, ch. 3 = Crime = Lott discusses the economics behind the changing levels of crime across the United States. He asserts that affirmative action in police hiring has caused an increase in crime and argues that the death penalty, citizens with concealed weapons carry permits have worked to decrease crime. He also writes that gun control regulations have had little effect on the crime rate.Freedomnomics, ch. 4 = Women's suffrage = Lott states that women's suffrage has led to an increase in the size and scope of government in the US, and that states that gave women the vote increased spending afterwards compared to others. = Voting = Lott discusses factors that he believes affect voter turnout and voter fraud in the United States. These include older examples such as the poll tax, secret ballots, and literacy tests and recent examples such as voting machines, felony voting, the 2000 Florida vote, public schools and alleged bias in the media.Freedomnomics, ch. 5  Reviews  Lott's promotional blog for the book cites various other blogs that reviewed it.Lott's Freedomnomics website Robert VerBruggen, an assistant editor at The Washington Times, praised the book by stating that it \\"entertains, educates and argues forcefully.\\" He referred to Lott as \\"a great writer, especially for the general public\\" and remarked that Lott's work \\"renders lots of charts, graphs and statistical analysis into clear, uncomplicated conversation.\\" He also wrote, \\"Scholar wars may seem petty at times, but this book shows they lead to some worthwhile endeavors.\\" National Review ran a supportive review that read \\"Lott successfully engages a number of current political debates and succeeds in making a number of cogent and well researched arguments in favor of free markets.\\"Michael J.

He outgrew the club, however, and made the switch to Dublin city club Belvedere where he was part of a very talented team, enjoying a lot of success before being brought to Bohemians in 2005. He progressed quickly, making his debut in the League of Ireland Cup at home to St. Patrick's Athletic in June 2005 with his league debut coming less than 2 months later against Shelbourne. He was voted Bohemians under-21 Player of the Year in 2005 and Bohemians Young Player of the Year in 2006 and 2007. He was also the FAI Schools Player of the Year in 2006. Conor picked up his first medal in senior football as Bohs marched to the 2008 league title. This achievement was rewarded when he was voted on to the League of Ireland Premier Division Team for 2008, receiving 56% of the votes for the left back position.http://www.eircomloi.ie/news-centre/news-1/2008/news-15/index.xml Conor scored his first ever senior goal for Bohs during the 2009 campaign on 9 October in Dalymount Park against Drogheda United. At the season's end, Powell picked up his second consecutive league winners medal as Bohemians won their first ever back-to-back titles, beating rivals Shamrock Rovers by 4 points. His fine form during the season was rewarded when he voted the PFAI Young Player of the Year for 2009. Due to Bohemians' financial trouble Powell parted company with the club at the end of the 2010 season. On 6 January 2011, it was reported that he was to join the English League One side Colchester United, where he would team up with former Irish teammate Dave Mooney. However, after only making two league appearances since his January move to Colchester, he was released from the club on 10 May 2011. His only appearances coming in a Good Friday trip to Brentford on 22 April 2011 and against already Champions, Brighton, in a televised game on 25 April 2011. On 9 July, Sligo Rovers announced the signing of Powell until the end of the season. On 18 January 2012, it was announced that Powell had signed for Shamrock Rovers for the 2012 season. He was unveiled at the Tallaght Stadium alongside Killian Brennan, Graham Gartland, Daryl Kavanagh and player-coach Colin Hawkins. In November 2012 Powell signed on for another season. At the beginning of 2014, Powell signed for Norwegian side Vard Haugesund where he spent one season. On 2 February 2015, it was announced that Powell had signed for League of Ireland side Longford Town. Following Longford's relegation from the Premier Division at the end of the 2016 season, Powell left the club.

Until 1907, Bloch was the physician of Adolf Hitler's family. Because Bloch was an Austrian Jew, Hitler later awarded Bloch special protection after the Nazi annexation of Austria.Cowley, Jason: The search for Dr.Bloch. Granta, 79, October 1st, 2002; retrieved 2007-04-24 Early years Bloch was born in Frauenberg (today Hlubok√° nad Vltavou, Czech Republic),Brigitte Hamann: Hitlers Edeljude - Das Leben des Armenarztes Eduard Bloch, Munich 2008 studied medicine in Prague and then served as a medical officer in the Austrian army. He was stationed in Linz from 1899 until his discharge in 1901, at which point he opened a private doctor's practice there. His practice was in the baroque house at 12 Landstrasse, where he also lived with his family: his wife, Emilie (n√©e Kafka) and their daughter Trude, born in 1903. According to Linz's future mayor Ernst Koref, Bloch was held in high regard, particularly among the lower and indigent social classes. It was generally known that at any time at night he was willing to call on patients. He used to go on visits in his hansom, wearing a conspicuous broad-brimmed hat. Like most Jews in Linz at the time, the Bloch family were assimilated. Hitler family doctor The first member of the Hitler family Bloch was to see was Adolf Hitler. In 1904, Hitler had become seriously ill and was bedridden due to a serious lung ailment. Due to this, he was allowed to abandon his school career and return home. However, after checking Hitler's files, Bloch later maintained that he had treated the youth for only minor ailments, cold or tonsilitis and that Hitler had been neither robust nor sickly. He also stated that Hitler did not have any illness whatsoever, let alone a lung disease.\\"The Mind of Adolf Hitler\\", Walter C. Langer, New York 1972 p.127-128 In 1907, Hitler's mother, Klara Hitler, was diagnosed with breast cancer. She died on 21 December after intense suffering involving daily medication with iodoform, a foul-smelling and painful corrosive treatment typically used at the time and administered by Bloch. Because of the poor economic situation of the Hitler family, Bloch charged reduced prices, sometimes taking no fee at all. The then 18-year-old Hitler granted him his \\"everlasting gratitude\\" for this (\\"Ich werde Ihnen ewig dankbar sein\\"). This showed in 1908 when Hitler wrote Bloch a postcard assuring him of his gratitude and reverence which he expressed with handmade gifts, as for example, a large wall painting which according to Bloch's daughter Gertrude (Trude) Kren (born 1903 in Austria, died 1992 in the US) was lost in the course of time. Even in 1937, Hitler inquired about Bloch's well- being and called him an \\"Edeljude\\" (\\"noble Jew\\"). Bloch also apparently had a special fondness for the Hitler family which may have saved his life. Emigration After Germany's annexation of Austria in March 1938 (Anschluss), life became harder for Austrian Jews. After Bloch's medical practice was closed on 1 October 1938, his daughter and son-in-law, Bloch's young colleague Dr. Franz Kren (born 1893 in Austria, died 1976 in the US), emigrated overseas. The 66-year-old Bloch then wrote a letter to Hitler asking for help and was as a consequence put under special protection by the Gestapo. He was the only Jew in Linz with this status. Bloch stayed in his house with his wife undisturbed until the formalities for his emigration to the United States were completed. Without any interference from the authorities, they were able to sell their family home at market value, highly unusual with the distress sales of emigrating Jews at the time and Nazi expropriation of Jewish assets through the Reich Flight Tax. Moreover, the Blochs were allowed to take the equivalent of 16 Reichsmark out of the country; the usual amount allowed to Jews was a mere 10 Reichsmark. In 1940, Bloch emigrated to the US and settled in the Bronx, 2755 Creston Avenue, New York City but was no longer able to practice medicine because his medical degree from Austria-Hungary was not recognised. He died of stomach cancer in 1945 at age 73, barely a month after Hitler's death. He is buried in Beth David Cemetery, Section D, Block 3, Elmont, New York.* * Interviews and memoirs In 1941 and 1943, Bloch was interviewed by the Office of Strategic Services (a predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency) to gain information about Hitler's childhood. He also published his memories about the encounter with the later \\"F√ºhrer\\" in the Collier's Weekly in which he painted a remarkably positive picture of young Hitler, saying that he was not a ruffian, neither was he untidy or impolite: > As a youth he was quiet, well mannered and neatly dressed. He waited > patiently in the waiting room until it was his turn, then like every 14- or > 15-year old boy, bowed as a sign of respect, and always thanked the doctor > politely. Like many other youngsters of Linz, he wore short lederhosen and a > green woolen hat with a feather. He was tall and pale and looked older than > his age. His eyes which he inherited from his mother were large, melancholic > and thoughtful. To a very large extent, this boy lived within himself. What > dreams he dreamed I do not know. Bloch also said that Hitler's most striking feature was his love for his mother: > While Hitler was not a mother's boy in the usual sense, I never witnessed a > closer attachment. Their love had been mutual. Klara Hitler adored her son. > She allowed him his own way whenever possible. For example, she admired his > watercolor paintings and drawings and supported his artistic ambitions in > opposition to his father at what cost to herself one may guess. However, Bloch expressly denies the claim that Hitler's love for his mother was pathological. In his memory, Hitler was the \\"saddest man I had ever seen\\" when he was informed about his mother's imminent death. He remembered Klara Hitler, Hitler's mother, as a very \\"pious and kind\\" woman. \\"Sie w√ºrde sich im Grabe herumdrehen, wenn sie w√ºsste, was aus ihm geworden ist.\\" (\\"She would turn in her grave if she knew what became of him.\\") According to Bloch, after Alois Hitler's death, the family's financial resources were scarce. He mentioned that Klara Hitler had lived frugally and had not indulged in even the smallest extravagance. Works about Bloch Despite the obvious affection Hitler showed to Bloch, historian Rudolph Binion believes that he was one of the contributing factors to Hitler's antisemitism that later resulted in the Holocaust.Binion, Rudolph New York Review of Books Volume 22, Number 10 ¬∑ June 12, 1975; retrieved 2007-04-23 Historian Brigitte Hamann takes the opposite view, arguing that Hitler's antisemitism coalesced later, after Hitler's years in Vienna. Among the other acquaintances of Bloch was Hedda Wagner, an author and supporter of women's rights, who wrote a book dedicated to him. Writer Jay Neugeboren set his novel 1940 in the Bronx and focuses on events surrounding Eduard Bloch. See also *Hugo Gutmann References  Sources  * Eduard Bloch: My Patient Hitler.

The character first appeared on- screen on 9 October 2001 in episode \\"Rogue Males\\" - series 4, episode 1 of the programme. Ric is the longest serving character in the show, having played the role for 18 years. Development Discussing the storyline which saw Ric's oldest son Leo die from a heroin overdose, Quarshie said; \\"I don't think his death is a shock to Ric as he almost expected it. It's devastating for him, but in true Ric style he holds everything in and throws himself into work. The consequences of the tragedy are felt later down the line.\\" He drew on Ric's troubled relationship with his own father to explain his distant relationship with his children, assessing; \\"Ric had a domineering and violent father. He swore he'd never be that controlling with his own kids and as a result he was too hands-off.\\" In July 2010, Quarshie revealed that Ric would be diagnosed with inoperable cancer, explaining: It's asymptomatic ‚Äì you don't know you've got it until it's spread... It's so far gone, what's the point in having chemotherapy?\\" He stated that following the diagnosis, Ric would become close to Annalese Carson, the estranged wife of his colleague Michael Spence. As a long-standing cast member, Quarshie has been granted leave to pursue other projects including directing an episode of Holby City. Series producer Simon Harper has stated that the actor is allowed to ensure the character remains in the show for a longer tenure. The character remained off-screen for several months during 2015 and returned on 29 December 2015, where he was appointed clinical lead on Keller ward. Quarshie appears as Ric in a two-part crossover episode with Holby City sister show, Casualty, originally broadcast in March 2019. Storylines Ric arrived at Holby City Hospital in episode \\"Rogue Males\\" as a General Surgical Consultant. It was revealed in the show's seventh series that he originated from Ghana, where his brother Kumi runs a hospital. He has been married five times - twice to Critical Care Consultant Lola Griffin - and has had several romances during his time on the show, including engagement to Senior House Officer Sam Kennedy, long term flirtation with former flame Diane Lloyd, and a brief marriage to Registrar Thandie Griffin. Diane and Ric got even more close in Ghana, while Keller ward was downsized and Diane hoped Ric would come back to Holby. He refused but eventually moved back. He had to put Diane under supervision while she was a consultant because a healthcare commission worker told him so. Diane committed suicide because she felt nobody supported her and when Thandie found out that Ric loved Diane, she broke up with him. Ric went to have a time alone with Diane in the mortuary and he had a breakdown. Two of Ric's six children have appeared in the show; oldest son Leo Griffin, who Ric initially hoped would follow him into medicine, but died in series ten from a heroin overdose, and daughter Jess Griffin, who worked alongside him at Holby City Hospital as an AAU nurse. Through Jess and Leo, Ric had three grandsons. Two died as infants, but Jess's second son Jacob survived, and is still with Jess. In the show's tenth series, Ric applied for the position of Director of Surgery, making an underhand deal to turn the position over to Connie Beauchamp in return for her support with his application. As each of the other candidates dropped out or were rejected, Ric was moments away from being offered the position, when he was called away to identify his son's body. Later in mid series 11, Connie reminded Ric, that the director of surgery job was up and he had to pass it over to her like they had agreed. But Ric didn't and made out that he had resigned and had to give three months notice. Connie found out that he was lying. In the end Connie and Ric constantly battled each other, but Ric still holds down the position of the job. Ric had recently introduced breathalyser tests as part of his zero tolerance policy. Annalese Carson failed hers. Ric promised to cover it up as long as Paul Rose supervised her in theatre. But Connie found out and reported it to Jayne. A full investigation was held into the death of Steve Hewitt. He was a friend and patient of Connie's who died during an operation Michael Spence was performing. Ric had previously refused to operate on him as he was a zero tolerance patient, but his condition deteriorated. Michael Spence operated on Steve Hewitt. Annalese was the anaesthetist in the operation and she hadn't given proper drugs when he arrested and died on the table. His wife wanted an investigation, and Kathy Hewitt blamed Ric. An investigation was held and Connie discovered the hidden information Michael had tried to hide. In episode thirty-five of series eleven Ric Griffin was informed by Jayne Grayson that she has lost confidence in his leadership as Director of Surgery and was planning to ask the board to re-advertise the position. At the end of the episode Jayne is seen handing a piece of paper with details of the director of surgery job to Connie. During Season 17 Episode 32 The Ides of March (May 2015) Ric took an extended break from Holby to visit his daughter Jess in Australia, he returned on the episode Beginnings - Season 18 Episode 12 (29th Dec 2015) however was out of place upon his return due to his extended absence. Reception Quarshie has been nominated for several awards for his portrayal of Ric, and won \\"Favourite Male TV Star\\" at the 2008 Screen Nation Awards. He was nominated for the \\"Male Performance in TV\\" award at the 2006 Screen Nation Awards, and received a Mention in the same category in 2007. Quarshie was named 23rd \\"Best Actor\\" in the 2004 BBC Drama Awards, and came 22nd the following year. He was long-listed for the \\"Most Popular Actor\\" award at the 2004 and 2005 National Television Awards, and was also long- listed for the \\"Best Actor\\" award at the 2004 TV Quick Awards.

Nirschl is a sixth-generation builder of musical instruments. Nirschl builds brass instruments, including trumpets, trombones, French horns, mellophones, euphoniums, and tubas, under the 'Meister Walter Nirschl' brand in his factory in Bavaria and collaborates with Gemstone Musical Instruments on the W. Nirschl brass line. Nirschl's instruments are played in some of the finest orchestras in the world. Nirschl's great-great-great-great-grandfather started making harmonicas and later brass instruments in central Graslitz, Bohemia in 1810. His grandfather, Wenzel Meinl, set up a music shop in Geretsried in 1945, and Walter later trained at the shop with his uncle Anton Meinl. After learning the business in his uncle‚Äôs factory, Nirschl apprenticed at other factories, including American and French shops. Eventually he purchased the B√∂hm & Meinl Symphonic, a brass instrument company in Geretsried, which at the time was the only company in the world making large bore piston tubas in the size and style of the great American York tubas. Carl Fischer, a music publisher who then owned the York name, sold \\"York Master\\" instruments that were designed to be visually and functionally similar to the American designs, but were made in Germany on completely different tooling by B√∂em & Meinl. In 2002, Nirschl was hired by a company in the United Kingdom to modernize a factory in India, and used his company in Geretsried to build prototypes. After significant investment, the financial backers decided to get out of the music business, which left the Indian factory dormant. Gemstone Musical Instruments recognized the opportunity and partnered with Nirschl, which combined the 60 year sales and marketing traditions of the Gemeinhardt Company with the six generations of German instrument craftsmanship. A full line of 'W. Nirschl' brass instruments is now produced in China, Brazil and India.

The comic draws from a wide range of ideas ‚Äì from futurism and transhumanism to corporatism and counter-culture. According to series writer Warren Ellis, Doktor Sleepless may be a man named John Reinhardt, a trust-fund baby and boy genius who is shunned by the counter-culture he helped found. After disappearing from the city of Heavenside three years ago, he suddenly returns having undergone some changes during the interim. Upon his return, he's transformed himself from a relatively mundane man into what he describes as a \\"cartoon mad scientist,\\" calling himself \\"Doktor Sleepless.\\" Ellis compares the series to his earlier fan-favorite work on Transmetropolitan, published under the DC Comics imprint, Vertigo. Due to a series of computer difficulties the series (along with other titles Ellis worked on at the time) was placed on hiatus. Release of new material was planned for early 2012 (after which the book would go on another hiatus),Warren's Work FAQ (Revised Apr 2011) , delayed several timesWarren Ellis >> FAQ(dated January 3, 2012, revised at unspecified date between Jan 2 2013 and May 2, 2013) and ultimately failed to materialize.  Synopsis  Set in the near future, this series follows the exploits of John Reinhardt, an enigmatic \\"mad scientist\\"Doktor Sleepless whose motivations for returning to Heavenside are shady at best. Since his mysterious disappearance, he has reinvented himself as \\"Doktor Sleepless\\" and, to the dismay and utter confusion of the authorities, seemingly rules the airwaves (through his mastery of all things technological) with his thought-provoking, radical rhetoric. He addresses the disenfranchised citizens of Heavenside, acknowledging their disappointment in the \\"future\\" they live in. With the resources, knowledge and ambition that John Reinhardt possesses, everyone is listening and watching closely as he represents the one shard of hope everyone is looking for. It is initially unclear if he works at inciting a truly positive revolution or has much darker, harmful plans for the people of Heavenside, until the sixth issue where he states outright his plans to bring about the apocalypse, using Heavenside as a testing ground. His stated reason is that this is \\"not the future we were promised... if we can't have that, then we shouldn't have anything at all\\". It is revealed he is deliberately instigating violence by the grinder counter-culture and is providing them with the means to do so, as well as releasing a bioweapon ‚Äî \\"St Theresa's Eyes\\" ‚Äî that causes people to \\"see angels\\" (actually winged, mechanical constructs which may or may not be hallucinations). By the eighth issue, he has claimed that the world is merely a source of food for a race of tenth-dimensional animals (based on the Cthulhu Mythos stories) that feed on souls and live in a realm similar to Heaven; he claims these creatures killed his parents and that while he originally wanted to organise people against these creatures, he now just wants to kill the whole world to spite the monsters by starving them. While Doktor Sleepless gives the impression of being in full control, it is unknown how true this is. He is unaware his companion (\\"Nurse\\") murdered an old colleague of his that he intended to contact; directly after outlining his grand scheme, he is shocked when he sees one of the angel constructs himself. From issue nine on, the series focuses less on the Doktor himself and more on how Heavenside has changed in his wake. It is also revealed that his former caretaker plans not only to kill him but anyone who could spread his ideas. Preston Stoker, the police commissioner, agrees to turn a blind eye to this.

At that point he moved east to study for the ministry at St. Stephen's College, a small Episcopal institution in Annandale-on-Hudson, in New York's Hudson Valley. Once there, Fite was drawn to the stage at the campus theater, and at the end of his third year he dropped out. He joined a traveling troupe of actors, and later moved to Woodstock, where he performed with a local theater. According to an anecdote that his stepson, Tad Richards, relates, Fite discovered his passion for sculpting suddenly one day when, while sitting backstage during a performance, he absentmindedly pulled out his pocketknife and began whittling on a seamstress's discarded spool that had rolled under his chair. A recognized sculptor, Fite was invited in 1933 to organize the fine arts program at his alma mater (St. Stephen's), which, in the three years since his departure, had affiliated with Columbia University and been renamed Bard College. Fite taught there until his retirement in 1969. He settled across the river at the Maverick art colony outside Woodstock, New York. Opus 40 In May 1938, Fite purchased an idle bluestone quarry in Saugerties, New York,\\"About Opus 40 & Harvey Fite\\". Opus 40 Sculpture Park and Museum. opus40.org. Retrieved 2017-06-18. a 12-acre site formerly owned by the widow of the last quarrymaster. He designed, engineered and hand-built a fine wooden house at the edge of the quarry grounds, facing the Catskill Mountains, and settled there in High Woods, a rural hamlet within the township of Saugerties, which neighbors Woodstock. Over many years, he embellished his home's exterior with grand necklaces of quarryman's chains, and filled the interior and attached studio with murals, paintings and sculpture, going as far as whittling door handles of arched nudes, so that the building itself is now a museum of Fite's artwork. That summer he was invited by the Carnegie Institute to do restoration work on ancient Mayan sculpture in Copan, Honduras. Fite was profoundly influenced by the art and architecture of the Maya, especially by their method of dry-stone construction. The next spring he began to organize the rubble scattered about the disused quarry, beginning what eventually became his life's work: a sculptured environment of terraces, alleys, ramps, steps and rain-fed pools which he would eventually name \\"Opus 40\\", as he estimated it would take him forty years to complete. Over the decades, Fite single-handedly moved and positioned stones, including at one point a nine-ton bluestone monolith, using ancient Egyptian methods of leverage and hoisting. Death Harvey Fite died tragically in May 1976 while at work on Opus 40, in the process of completing an attached open-air \\"theater\\" at the site's northwestern extreme; he was riding a power lawnmower at the time, and he fell into the quarry from a 12-foot precipice. He was 72 years old, and had worked alone on his magnum opus for the last 37 years of his life.

He sang more than fifty-five lyric and dramatic roles. He performed with the New York City Opera from 1945 to 1952 and with the Metropolitan Opera from 1953 to 1961.  Early life  Gari was born Samu Gyula in 1909 in Mediasch, Nagy-K√ºk√ºll≈ë County, Austria-Hungary (now Media≈ü, Romania), the youngest of a family of ten children. He gained recognition as a child singing in operetta throughout Romania and Hungary. He studied with the celebrated Viennese soprano Lotte Gelinek and later at the Verdi Conservatory in Milan.  Career  In 1938, he made his operatic debut at Rome's Teatro Reale dell‚ÄôOpera, when he substituted for Tito Schipa as Almaviva in Gioachino Rossini's Barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville) under the baton of the legendary Tullio Serafin. Soon after, he secured a National Broadcasting Company contract singing weekly with the NBC Symphony Orchestra and performing on the NBC Radio show, \\"Musical Bits\\", with Phil Spitalny conducting. In 1939, he sang at the St Louis Opera in the American premiere of Gian Carlo Menotti's Amelia Goes to the Ball, beginning his long association with Maestro Laszlo Halasz, the founder of the New York City Opera.

His versatility, preparedness, and stamina were legendary. When he performed both Turiddu in Cavalleria Rusticana and Canio in Pagliacci, rarely ever attempted, the New York Times lauded him for singing both parts \\"with their different tessitura and their severe demands on an artist's vocal and histrionic endurance\\", and for delivering each \\"with remarkable control of his fine voice and an unusual depth of human feeling. That same evening he went on to sing Don Jose in Carmen. Gari could always be counted on to appear whenever occasion demanded and to deliver superb performances, even when he was singing a regular 32-week schedule. Once during the Metropolitan Opera's annual seven-week tour he was flown to Boston to sing his first Don Carlo in a performance hailed as \\"sterling.\\" He also astounded everyone when he made last-minute appearances as the Duke in Rigoletto, Don Jose in Carmen, and Dimitry in Boris Godunov, on three successive nights.

The character first appeared on 8 November 2005 in the episode \\"More Equal Than Others\\" - series eight, episode four of the programme. He made his departure during the seventeenth series episode \\"At First I Was Afraid\\" broadcast 22 September 2015. Bradley agreed to reprise the role in 2019, to celebrate the show's twentieth anniversary. Elliot was introduced as a consultant surgeon and Clinical Lead on Holby General's cardiothoracic surgery ward. His storylines have seen his wife Gina, a motor neuron disease-sufferer, commit assisted suicide, and his relationship with his children subsequently deteriorate. Elliot considered suicide himself, before reconciling with his family. He ended a brief romance with colleague Lady Byrne as he was still mourning Gina, and later shared a kiss with his old friend Tara Sodi. Bradley was cast in the role after originally auditioning for a more minor part, and impressing executive producer Richard Stokes. He observed real heart surgery being performed in preparation for the role, and bases his portrayal of Elliot on his own father, who was a doctor. Elliot is portrayed as \\"a disorganised genius\\" and \\"a medical Columbo\\". He was the focus of Holby City 2007 Christmas episode, based on the 1946 film It's a Wonderful Life. The assisted suicide storyline proved controversial, though the Elliot-centric Christmas episode was generally well received by critics. The Times David Chater called it \\"highly effective in what it sets out to do\\", though Robert Hanks of The Independent deemed it \\"incompetent to the point of sacrilege\\". Creation Elliot was introduced to Holby City in November 2005 as the new Clinical Lead of the hospital's cardiothoracic surgery ward. Paul Bradley was cast in the role, having auditioned for a smaller part and impressed executive producer Richard Stokes, who asked him to audition for a longer-term character. Bradley met with the show's producers, who offered him the role of Elliot on the spot. His casting was announced in June 2005, when series producer Emma Turner commented: \\"The man is a great surgeon but his shambolic appearance and eccentric manner will cause the highly-political Connie's feathers to become ruffled. Elliott is a devoted family man who absorbs the pain he sees around him - but there will always be a price to pay.\\" As research for the role, Bradley observed three operations at the University College London Heart Hospital, an experience he described as \\"amazing\\" and a privilege to attend. Bradley's father was a doctor in Nuneaton, and he attempts to emulate him onscreen through his portrayal of Elliot. Bradley has described his first few weeks on Holby City as amongst the hardest acting experiences he has ever had, due to the medical terminology, props and procedures associated with the role. Jim Shelly of The Mirror commented unfavourably on the \\"horrible inevitability\\" of Bradley's casting, as he had previously portrayed Nigel Bates in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Shelley noted a trend for former EastEnders and Channel 4 soap Brookside actors being cast in Holby City. The show is filmed at Elstree Studios, where EastEnders is also filmed. Bradley has commented that it is \\"strange\\" making the same journey to a different show, and has noted differences between Elliot and his EastEnders character Nigel in that Elliot has a \\"better wardrobe\\" and is more intelligent. He has also commented that working on Holby City is \\"harder\\" than EastEnders, as the show is filmed with a single-camera set-up which takes longer, and there are \\"more things to go wrong\\" when working with medical props and simulating operations. Development Elliot is described on the BBC Online Holby City homepage as \\"a disorganised genius\\" who \\"comes across as a bumbling eccentric\\" but has surgical expertise which is \\"second to none\\". Bradley has deemed Elliot \\"a medical Columbo\\", who is \\"shambling, untidy but good with patients and a genius medically\\", as well as \\"a brilliant surgeon who does everything in an off-the-wall way.\\" He has been described as \\"genial\\" by The Mirror Shelley, while fellow Mirror critic Jane Simon has deemed him \\"shambling\\" and \\"not the most convincing medic we've ever seen\\". Comparing Elliot to fellow cardiothoracic consultant Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), Bradley explained: \\"Connie is text book brilliant, whereas Elliot is more inspired. He may seem eccentric but he really listens to his patients - he's very straight forward and not at all stuck up. They are chalk and cheese. Connie's side of the office is very neat and tidy. But Elliot's is a total mess. She's quite uptight, and anybody as relaxed as Elliot really gets on her nerves.\\" On 17 November 2006, Bradley appeared as Elliot in a Children in Need segment featuring the Holby City cast performing a version of \\"Hung Up\\" by Madonna. Elliot's wife Gina suffers from motor neuron disease. An October 2006 storyline saw her travel to a clinic in Switzerland, where euthanasia is legal. Gillian Bevan, who plays Gina, explained: \\"Gina can't bear to be a burden to her husband any longer. She is adamant that Elliot wouldn't understand her decision.\\" Although Elliot comes to understand Gina's decision, and is by her side as she dies, his relationship with his children becomes strained as a result. Sam Stockman, who plays Elliot's son James, explained in October 2007: \\"[James] still blames Elliot for helping his Mum die and then just posting her suicide note to him, which was the first he heard about her death\\". The Holby City 2007 Christmas episode, \\"Elliot's Wonderful Life\\", was a reimagining of the 1964 film It's a Wonderful Life featuring Elliot, and guest-starring Richard Briers as his guardian angel. It was filmed in North London over three weeks. Series producer Diana Kyle described the episode as Elliot \\"go[ing] on a major emotional journey and tak[ing] time to reassess his life\\". Bradley explained: \\"Elliot goes into this complete breakdown and decides to kill himself\\", and discussed Elliot's motivation in considering suicide: \\"Something in his brain snaps. He's overworked and emotionally overwrought.\\" He explained that, while the episode is based on It's a Wonderful Life: \\"the screen doesn't go wobbly so you know you're in fantasy world. It's played very straight. There are some really interesting things going on - angels in the corridors and nobody knows who this old man is. But it's not all doom and gloom, there's humour in there and it's a bit of an adventure.\\" Bradley was pleased to work with Briers, commenting: \\"Richard has always been a hero of mine. He's an actor I've always wanted to be like. We got on so well; we were exhausted from laughing!\\" Briers added of the storyline: \\"It's extraordinary to pinch a marvellous idea from a great film.\\" On 22 September 2015, during the seventeenth series, Elliot departed the show after ten years. His exit was kept a secret to surprise viewers. Elliot was seen leaving Holby to be with his love interest Brigitte Nye (Sally Dexter). The show's executive producer Oliver Kent hoped Bradley would return in the future, saying the door would be open for him. Kent added \\"We all adore Elliot Hope and we will miss him like crazy. Paul has been a fabulous member of the Holby City family for 10 years, and we thank him from the bottom of our hearts for all his incredible work.\\" In 2019, Bradley agreed to reprise the role of Elliot to celebrate the show's twentieth anniversary. Elliot will appear for a five episode run in which he will get reacquainted with Jac. In addition it soon becomes clear he has an ulterior motive for returning. Of his return Bradley stated that \\"I'm really looking forward to returning to a programme on which I spent so many happy year.\\" Storylines Elliot arrives at Holby city episode \\"More Equal Than Others\\", when it is revealed he has beaten cardiothoracic consultant Connie Beauchamp to the position of Clinical Lead. He later steps down from this position in order to spend more time with his wife, Gina (Gillian Bevan), who has motor neuron disease and goes on to end her life by euthanasia, with Elliot by her side. Elliot's relationship with his children, James (Sam Stockman) and Martha (Holly Lucas), is strained following their mother's suicide. James goes missing, causing Elliot to worry his son has also committed suicide, before returning from Bangkok with a heroin addiction. He becomes involved in gang violence and is shot. Although he recovers, Martha is resentful when Elliot refuses to attend his trial, where James is given a 12-month suspended sentence. When Martha is shot with a crossbow, Elliot considers suicide, but ultimately decides against it and his family reconciles. Elliot has a brief romance with Lady Byrne (Jane Asher), the mother of his registrar Joseph (Luke Roberts), however he ends the relationship as he is still mourning Gina. Martha leaves Holby to attend university, returning two years later having married in Las Vegas without telling her father. Elliot is upset, so Martha plans a picnic at which Elliot can get to know her new husband Ben (Oliver Boot) better. At the picnic, Elliot's dog Samson is run over by an ambulance, resulting in a pneumothorax. Elliot operates on Samson in a basement theatre, and he makes a full recovery. When Ben confides in Elliot that he is experiencing on-going health problems, he initially agrees not to tell Martha, not wanting her to worry. Martha later learns Ben is in the early stages of Sarcoidosis and will be blind within months. Relating his own experience of Gina's failing health, Elliot advises Martha to leave Ben, and ultimately they break up. When Martha arranges a surprise party for Elliot's 50th birthday, he is re-introduced to an old friend from university, Tara Sodi (Meera Syal). He and Tara formerly performed pioneering heart surgery together, but their patient died. Tara attempts to convince Elliot to try their technique again. Elliot initially refuses, but later changes his mind. The operation is successful, and Tara is offered a full-time contract at Holby General. When Tara revives a patient with a DNR order against his wishes, tension arises between her and Elliot over the issue of euthanasia, with Tara unaware of the circumstances of Gina's death. Despite this, Elliot convinces her to sign her contract, and the two share a kiss. In later years, Elliot mentors both Penny (Emma Catherwood) and her brother Oliver Valentine (James Anderson). He becomes very friendly with Penny, and is devastated when she is killed trying to save a patient's life. He tries to help Oliver overcome his grief. Elliot's job is threatened when Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) attempts to merge Darwin Ward with the heart surgery ward at St. James' hospital, but he puts an end to the plans and Elliot keeps his job. He becomes determined to see the scientific project he has worked off for many years, the Hertzig (an electronic heart), into practise, and is delighted when he finds a potential patient. However, the patient withdraws their consent at the last minute, and Elliot risks his career by putting it in anyway. There are complications and the patient later dies. Elliot trains a new F1, Tara Lo (Jing Lusi), when she comes to Darwin, and becomes close with her. A second potential Hertzig patient arrives on Darwin, and he and Tara successfully use the Hertzig on her; however, a number of months later, she returns to the ward with problems and soon dies. Tara is devastated, and she reveals to Elliot that she has a brain tumour and the Hertzig trial made that very real. Elliot keeps the information from Tara's boyfriend, Oliver. When he finds out, he lashes out at Elliot for not telling him. Tara's tumour starts evolving again, and Elliot brings in a brain surgeon to operate on her. Tara dies from complications during surgery. Elliot becomes worried for Oliver, who married Tara the night before her death, and tries to help him. Oliver later leaves Holby City on good terms with Elliot. Elliot starts a relationship with Oliver's psychiatrist, Sharon Kozinsky (Madeleine Potter), and they become serious until Sharon gets a job offer in America. Although he originally plans to take a sabbatical and visit America with her, Elliot decides it is a step too far and says goodbye to her. After Jonny and Mo clash, their friendship becomes strained. Jonny and Mo's issues impacted on their professional lives when Jonny disobeyed Mo orders that a transplant patient must stay in bed. Jonny allowed the patient to go to the chapel and she collapsed, leading Elliot to realise that there was trouble between Jonny and Mo. Elliot then threatened to remove them from the transplant team. The pair soon made amends pleasing Elliot whose team on Darwin ward was once again solid. Jac returns from her time away from the hospital in 2014 prematurely after learning of Elliot's worsening health to help with the Herzig 5 (artificial heart) project which leads to her having to take the lead halfway through the crucial operation being used to market the device. Guy Self then attempts to tempt Jac into taking Elliot's place; leading the Herzig 5 project and running Darwin ward. During episode 42 of series 16 (\\"One Small Step\\"), Jac is reunited with Connie by Guy for an endarterectomy procedure, pushing Jac into accepting Guy's offer of taking over Elliot's work. Elliot is delighted to be reunited with Connie but furious when he discovers Jac's betrayal. After Elliot has fully recovered from his ill health and recent surgery, Oliver Valentine returns to the hospital fourteen months after leaving for South America. As Oliver was not taking proper care of himself, he contracted a virus which has affected his heart. Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) discovers a \\"bloodied and badly bruised\\" Oliver near the hospital entrance, and admits him immediately. When it emerges that Oliver's condition is potentially fatal, he asks Elliot to fit him with his new surgical device. However, Jac refuses to let the surgery go ahead as the device is only in the experimental stage. When Jac says no, Olivers disappointed and angry. However, Elliot refuses to give up on Oliver and makes sure the operation goes ahead. Guy Self started to focus more onto the surgery side of things in April 2015, once he got told that he can not carry on performing in theatre and still be the Chief Executive Officer of Holby City Hospital. Guy was unhappy about this but he chose Neurosurgery over being the CEO, he apologised to Elliot about demoting him from being the Clinical Lead of Darwin and later reinstated him before he stepped down as the CEO. When Brigitte Nye comes back to Holby with Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori) who is seriously ill, he performs major surgery on her to prevent her dying. Midway through, Elliot runs into some problems and he realises that neither he or Oliver can do it. Jac arrives just in time and saves Frieda. Elliot reconsiders his future at Holby while he is talking to Jac about Brigitte. Jac points out that Elliot seems to be in love and Elliot decides to leave Holby to be with Brigitte. Reception Bradley was named 20th \\"Best Actor\\" in the 2006 BBC Drama Awards for his role as Elliot. He was longlisted for the 2007 National Television Awards, but was not shortlisted. The storyline which saw Elliot's wife Gina commit assisted suicide was the subject of a Daily Telegraph debate. Rachel Pickering, a GP and hospice doctor from Greenwich, opined that the storyline was to be \\"condemned\\". She criticised Gina's dying words: \\"I want to be allowed to die with dignity\\", suggesting that The Voluntary Euthanasia Society has \\"hijacked\\" the word \\"dignity\\" in changing its name to Dignity In Dying. Pickering wrote that, in her own experience, the majority of MND patients die peaceful natural deaths. She was opposed by two correspondents, Lena Pycroft of London and Ray Knight of Thaxted. Pycroft congratulated the BBC for \\"[bringining] into sharp relief the appalling dilemma facing terminally ill patients\\", while Knight commended: \\"The most telling point in the Holby City episode was that, having made the decision, the patient was happier and more relaxed - a fact repeatedly confirmed in real life. Is it not time our legislation reflected that?\\" The Times David Chater commented positively on the episode \\"Elliot's Wonderful Life\\", writing that: \\"Holby City fans will love this episode [...] It is highly effective in what it sets out to do, although ‚Äì like so much television at Christmas ‚Äì you need to drink a pint of warm Baileys for the full effect.\\" The episode was selected as recommended viewing by several TV critics, including Dydd Iau of the Liverpool Daily Post, and Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury, who noted: \\"It sounds a bit strange, but there's snow, carols and an uplifting happy ending for a change.\\" The Mirror Maeve Quigley called it \\"a timeless story\\", though questioned the plausibility of a world in which Elliot's patients went untreated, as \\"the NHS isn't a one-man band after all\\". In contrast, Robert Hanks of The Independent reviewed the episode negatively, calling it \\"incompetent to the point of sacrilege\\". Hanks wrote: \\"What it did add to the mix, that James Stewart never achieved, was to give the viewer an authentic frisson of empathy: there was a point towards the end ‚Äì during an encounter with Elliot's miraculously resurrected, motor-neurone-disease-afflicted yet remarkably soign√©e and articulate wife - when I began to see never having been born as preferable, sometimes, to prime-time TV.\\" References External links *Elliot Hope at BBC Online Category:Holby City characters Category:Fictional surgeons Category:Television characters introduced in 2005 Category:Fictional English people Category:Fictional characters with cancer Category:Fictional British people Category:Male characters in television Category:Crossover characters in television Category:Fictional cardiothoracic surgeons ","title":"Elliot Hope"},{"id":"10780029","text":"Market Weighton railway station was a railway station at the junction of the Selby to Driffield and York to Beverley lines in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England.

His first marriage to Michelle of Valois had produced no surviving issue and she had died young, so Philip married Bonne. Bonne is sometimes confused with Philip's biological aunt, also named Bonne of Burgundy (1379‚Äì1399) in part due to the papal dispensation required for the marriage which made no distinction between a marital aunt and a biological aunt.

Brauchli (born June 19, 1961) is a journalist, media investor and advisor. He is co-founder, along with Sa≈°a Vuƒçiniƒç, of North Base Media, an investment firm specialized in media and technology in global growth markets, and has served as an advisor to media groups including Graham Holdings, Univision and HT Media. He was executive editor of The Washington Post from 2008-2012, overseeing the Posts print and digital news operations. He succeeded Leonard Downie, Jr. and preceded Martin Baron. He previously served as the top editor of The Wall Street Journal before Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. acquired the Journal's parent company, Dow Jones. Early life and education A native of Boulder, Colorado, Brauchli graduated from Columbia College of Columbia University in 1983. Brauchli was a Nieman fellow at Harvard University from 1991 to 1992. Career Before joining the Post, Brauchli was managing editor of the Wall Street Journal. Brauchli had served 15 years as a foreign correspondent, mainly in Asia, and eight years as a senior editor in New York. Shortly after Brauchli's appointment as managing editor was announced, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. disclosed a takeover offer for Dow Jones & Co.', the Journal's parent. Brauchli remained as editor through the acquisition but four months afterwards, on April 22, 2008, he announced his resignation. The Post, under new publisher Katharine Weymouth, announced on July 8 that it had hired him. During his tenure, the Post won seven Pulitzer prizes, including five for the newsroom, and many other journalism awards. A 2012 account in The New York Times outlined signs and reports that Brauchli's \\"relationship with the publisher has cooled\\". It also noted that Raju Narisetti, whom Brauchli had brought with him from the Journal as a \\"close partner...in the digital reinvention of the newsroom\\", had left the Post in January. The Times also said that \\"[b]y one important measure, The Post‚Äôs efforts are paying off. Recently, it has averaged 19.6 million unique visitors a month, according to comScore, making it the second-most-visited American newspaper Web site, behind that of The New York Times\\".Peters, Jeremy W., \\"A Newspaper, and a Legacy, Reordered\\", The New York Times, February 11, 2012. Retrieved 2012-02-12. According to that same article about The Washington Post in The New York Times, \\"Mr. Brauchli has reacted to the upheaval by overseeing one of the most sweeping and closely watched reorientations of any newsroom in the country. The editors now stress online metrics and freely borrow from the playbooks of more nimble online competitors like Politico and The Huffington Post. The outcome of their efforts could offer a high-profile case study on how a company can foster an entrepreneurial, digital culture while remaining true to its heritage.\\" Brauchli stepped down as editor at the end of 2012 and took on a new role working for the Post's parent company, before the Post was sold to Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. As of 2015, Brauchli has started a new investment firm, North Base Media. North Base is focused on digital-media opportunities in emerging markets. NBM's investments include media companies Rappler in the Philippines; IDN Media in Indonesia; PocketAces in India; and technology companies such as OpenSlate in New York, Syte.io of Israel, and Zaiko in Japan. Personal life Brauchli has been based overseas in Hong Kong, Stockholm, Tokyo and Shanghai and has covered at least 20 countries. He is married to Maggie Farley, a former Los Angeles Times correspondent. They have two daughters, Aria, 20 and Zoe, 18.

Clarke, first published in 1949 in the magazine Startling Stories. The two- part story speculates on the cooling of the Sun as a doomsday scenario for Earth and an evolutionary advent for Venus. Plot summary The first part of the story is told from the perspective of a tribe of nomadic humans of the 30th century, in a future where Earth has entered a final ice age. The tribe is travelling toward the equator ahead of glaciers that are descending from the North Pole, but discovers, when they arrive in the last hospitable region of the planet, that glaciers from the South Pole have already almost reached them. The tribe carries with it a few relics from the previous centuries which it considers sacred, although the functions of the various objects have been forgotten. A generation later, just before the two glaciers fronts meet and spell ultimate extinction of the human species, the relics are safely relocated to a cairn on a mountain that stands between the two advancing bodies of ice. Among the relics there is a radio beacon built as an asteroid- tracking device that was never deployed but is still functioning. The second part of the story is told from the perspective of a race of Venusian reptiles who have evolved into intelligent beings capable of space travel in the 5,000 years since the cooling of the Sun. The Venusians travel to Earth and, attracted by the radio beacon, manage to recover the relics of the last tribe of humans, now the only remnants of civilization not buried under ice. The title of the story comes from the attempts of the Venusian scientists to reconstruct the life and times of erect bipeds that once walked on the Third Planet. After centuries of fruitless studies of humankind's last writings found in the relics the scientists believe a major breakthrough when they manage to decipher the working principle of a film reel that apparently contains an animated cartoon short, which ends with a section of text, which no amount of effort and speculation can decipher : \\"A Walt Disney Production\\". Similarities with other works by Clarke *According to Clarke's introduction to his story collection Reach for Tomorrow, this story shares its roots with \\"Rescue Party\\". \\"Rescue Party\\" is similar in that the Sun is changing in a way that dooms Earth. But rather than cooling, it explodes - destroying all planets. But both the response of humans to the event, & story endings, are very different. *There is another similarity with \\"Rescue Party\\" and also with \\"Trouble with the Natives\\" and 3001: The Final Odyssey. In all four stories, aliens draw naive conclusions from little information about humans ‚Äî a movie reel in this story, a 2D portrait in \\"Rescue Party\\", some BBC broadcasts in \\"Trouble with the Natives\\", and information taken from the end of the \\"Century of Torture\\", the 20th, in 3001: The Final Odyssey. *In one aspect, this story is very similar to a story in Clarke's 2010 Odyssey Two: superfast evolution of smart animals on a world newly made habitable. In 2010, the heating up of Europa brings native animals to the stage of human cavemen in just 20,000 years; in this story, the cooling of Venus brings Venusians to the level of spacefarers in just 5,000 years. *At the end of The Fountains of Paradise, the Sun cools temporarily (nevertheless for thousands of years, as in another \\"ice age\\") turning Earth into an icy wasteland. This situation is very similar to first story of \\"History Lesson\\". But the response of humans to this doomsday scenario is very different in the two works. Publication \\"History Lesson\\" was included in Clarke's anthology Expedition to Earth, published in 1953. In the British edition (Sidgwick & Jackson, 1954), the title was \\"Expedition to Earth\\", while the story otherwise also known under that title appeared there as Encounter in the Dawn.

The company is the country's main supplier and responsible for producing around 40% of the total natural gas consumption in Romania. Its majority stockholder is the Government of Romania, which owns 70.01%, while the remaining 29.09% are free-floated. In 2018, the company was the only state owned company surpassing ‚Ç¨1 billion in revenues. Romgaz is specialized in geological research for the discovery of hydrocarbons, production, storage, commercialization and the supply of natural gas and natural gas condensate. The company is structured into six branches: two production branches located in T√¢rgu Mure»ô and Media»ô, one underground storage branch located in Ploie≈üti, a special operations branch located in Media≈ü, a maintenance branch located in T√¢rgu Mure»ô and one international office located in Bratislava, Slovakia. History = Early history and foundation (1909-1960) = On the present-day territory of Romania, the first natural gas deposit was discovered in 1909, in SƒÉrmƒÉ≈üel, Mure≈ü County (then in Austria-Hungary), further to geological researches on potassium salts. The first gas production was used to power the steam boilers in SƒÉrmƒÉ≈üel and the gas lighting of the alleys in Bazna resort. The first gas transmission pipeline was built in 1914 covering the between SƒÉrmƒÉ≈üel and Turda, with the last being the first city in Europe to have public street lights fuelled by natural gas in 1916. In 1927 the first natural gas compression station in Europe was built in SƒÉrmƒÉ≈üel. Following the successful gas discovery many foreign companies started to prospect the territories including American, British, French and Austria-Hungarian companies. The American success in the exploitation and usage of natural gas determined the foundation of Societatea Maghiara de Gaz Metan UEG (Hungarian Methane Company) by the Hungarian Ministry of Finances and Deutsche Bank whose scope of activity was the exploration, exploitation, transmission, distribution and use of natural gas in certain regions within Transylvania. A prodigious period followed for the gas distribution business and the year 1941 marks the construction of the first natural gas pipeline from MƒÉne≈üti to Bucharest, while the following year a main pipeline is built for the transportation of natural gas from Transylvania to the capital city. After the unification of Transylvania and Romania in 1919 the Direc»õia gazului natural company is established at Cluj Napoca affiliated to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Bucharest, which later in 1925 was renamed to Societatea Na»õionalƒÉ de Gaz Metan SONAMETAN (National Methane Company). = Early expansions and formation of today's company (1961-2001) = The first underground storage facility was operated in 1961, and in 1976 the company's largest natural gas output was realised 29.8 cubic kilometers. In 1991 the company is renamed as Regia AutonomƒÉ Romgaz RA and in 1998 it is renamed as Societatea Na»õionalƒÉ de Gaze Naturale Romgaz SA. In the year 2000, Romgaz was then divided into five smaller independent companies: Exprogaz, Depogaz, Transgaz, Distrigaz Sud and Distrigaz Nord. And in 2001, Exprogaz and Depogaz were merged to create SNGN Romgaz SA the current company. = Privatization (2004-2013) = Until 2004, the government of Romania held 100% of shares in Romgaz and in 2005, first announced plans of privatizing the company. Discussions over possible investors were held until 2006 and then further delayed several times and eventually pushed back until 2009. In 2010, plans to sell 15% of the company resurfaced but another two years went by, before details of the deal to be became more specific. The government then decided to sell 15% of different energy companies via initial and secondary public offerings. Romgaz finally debuted the planned percentage of shares on Romanian and London stock exchanges in November 2013. The IPO became the largest in the history of Romania, raising almost ‚Ç¨390 million. In 2007, Romgaz was granted eight concessions by the Romanian National Agency for Mineral Resources (ANRM) and announced to invest ‚Ç¨220 million annually into exploration in the concession areas over the next three or four years (2007-2010). In the same year, Gazprom negotiated the establishment of a joint-venture with Romgaz, to build and operate storage facilities for up to two billion cubic meters of gas. In 2010, Templeton which since 2009 manages the Romanian national compensation fund Fondul Protrietatea, threatened legal action against the Romanian government, which attempted to use their shareholder superiority to channel money from the company to compensate for a national budget deficit. In 2015, Fondul sold a 3.78% stake in Romgaz and in 2016, sold another stake worth $132 million. In November 2013, after several years of delay in the privatization process, the government took a 15% stake of Romgaz public. The IPO raised $520 million. Following the initial offering, the company's shares rose and Romgaz was valued at around $4.0 billion. The IPO was part of a wider privatization agreement between Romania and the International Monetary Fund. = Recent developments (2013-) = In 2015, Romgaz announced that the company would expand their conventional gas operations and not invest into shale-gas technologies and exploration for now. General Director Virgil Metea stated: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say in the medium term, up to five years, we do not plan shale gas (exploration). This is our current stance.‚Äù In June 2016, Romgaz, Transgaz and OMV Petrom were raided by EU antitrust regulation agencies, suspected of working together to block gas exports to other EU countries. In 2017, the company announced the discovery a new gas field. The caragele gas field, with total proven reserves of around 986 billion cubic feet (28.2 km¬≥), was the largest gas discovery by Romgaz in the previous three decades. First production was initially expected to launch in 2019 and full operational functions are currently expected by 2021-2022. In 2018, news about a potential partnership between Romgaz and Azeri group Socar in different Black Sea offshore gas and pipeline projects surfaced. In November 2018, the company announced that it has ordered a feasibility study for a possible new gas power plant with a 400-500 MW capacity, to be erected in Mintia, near Deva. In February 2019, a Romanian delegation led by Iulian- Robert Tudorache, State Secretary of the Romanian Ministry of Energy, together with representatives of the Romanian companies Transgaz and Romgaz, visited Azerbaijan's Energy Ministry to discuss the potential participation of Romania in the Southern Gas Corridor.  Corporate affairs  = Structure = Romgaz has some minor subsidiaries. Since December 31, 2016 the company S.N.G.N. ROMGAZ S.A. ‚Äì Filiala de √énmagazinare SubteranƒÉ a Gazelor Naturale DEPOGAZ Ploie≈üti S.R.L. operates as a subsidiary, which is in charge of operating Romgaz's gas storage facilities. = Leadership = Romgaz is led by a seven- member board of directors, led by non-executive chairman Nistoran Dorin Liviu. Since 2018, the company's chief executive officer is Adrian Constantin Volintiru, who is also an executive member of the board of directors. = Shareholder = As of September 30, 2018, Romgaz's shareholder structure is: * 70.01% Romanian State (through the Ministry of Energy) *29.09% Free Float = Performance = For 2018, Romgaz planned investments of RON 1.6 billion, with around 50% designated for the construction of a new thermal power plant in Lernut. In February 2019, Romgaz announced preliminary results for 2018, reporting a total turnover of RON 5 billion ($1.2 billion) and net profits of 1.4 billion ($330 million). Operations Romania is one of the region's only countries to be largely energy independent. The country imports less than 10 percent of its total gas demand from Russia. The rest is produced locally, with Romgaz being one of the two major players in the market. = Upstream operations = In 2017, Romgaz reported proven gas reserves of 60.1 billion cubic metres (bcm), with additional 10.6 bcm probable and 12.8 bcm possible.  National  The production and storage of natural gas is realised by around 3,600 rigs and 20 compression stations. Romgaz owns a total of 153 commercial reservoirs located in Transylvania, Moldavia and Muntenia with around 75% or 114 being located in Transylvania especially in Mure≈ü and Sibiu counties. The company produced in 2009 5.76 cubic kilometers of natural gas and expects a 5% decrease in production for 2010 to around 5.65 cubic kilometers. The company operates several large natural gas fields like Bazna, Brodina, Caragele, Cop≈üa MicƒÉ, Deleni, Filitelnic, GrƒÉdi≈ütea, LaslƒÉu Mare, Mamu, Roman-Secuieni, ≈ûam≈üud, SƒÉrma≈üel, Sighi≈üoara and Zau de C√¢mpie with combined reserves exceeding 4.351 TCF (112 km¬≥). Romgaz has established partnerships with different companies in a total of 15 petroleum concessions based in Romania. The company has joint-ventures with Wintershall in the exploration and development of the RG 03 Transilvania South Block, with Falcon Oil & Gas in the exploitation of the Brodina and Cuejdiu Blocks, with Amromco Energy in the rehabilitation of 11 gas fields and with Schlumberger for the rehabilitation of LaslƒÉu Mare gas field. In 2017, total revenue for natural gas production and supply were $858 million (RON 3,604.96 million), representing a 32.6 percent increase in total income compared to 2016.  International  In 2008 Romgaz became co-titleholder of petroleum rights and obligations in 3 blocks from Slovakia and 2 blocks from Poland. Romgaz holds 25% interest share in three exploration blocks from Slovakia, namely Svidn√≠k gas field, Medzilaborce and Snina, and an interest share of 30% in two blocks from Poland, namely Torzym-Cybinka oil field. In 2010, Romgaz announced that it has acquired stakes in five oil and gas fields located in Iraq. = Storage = Romgaz operates six underground storage facilities with a combined capacity of 2.92 cubic kilometers. The storage facilities are located in SƒÉrmƒÉ≈üel and Cetatea de BaltƒÉ in Transylvania, Bilciure»ôti, BƒÉlƒÉceanca, Urziceni and Gherce»ôti in Southern Romania. The company also owns other storage facilities in joint-ventures with other companies like Depomure≈ü in T√¢rgu Mure≈ü and Amgaz in Nade»ô. The largest of the six storages is the Bilciure»ôti facility located North - North - West of Bucharest having a storage capacity of 1.3 cubic kilometers in one cycle and it is located at a depth of . Romgaz also operates a transmission network of pipelines, exceeding 3,000 kilometers. In 2017, total revenue for storage was $110 million (RON 464.18 million), representing a 46.44 percent increase in total income compared to 2016. Romgaz also owns a 41% stake in Engie's Depomures gas storage facility. = Electricity production = In 2017, Romgaz produced 1,863,788 MW (+14.5% compared to 2016), representing 2.68% of Romania's total electricity production. According to Transelectrica, the company's market share in 2017 was 2.95%. Most of Romgaz' electricity production comes from the Iernut Power Station, a large thermal power plant located in Iernut, Mure≈ü County. The company also runs experimental power generation projects at gas wells, that are located to far away to make a connection to Romania's national transmission system feasible. Currently wells Cojocna 2 and 4 are equipped with a 1.5 MW electricity generation unit each, which uses the wells combustion gas to supply power, which is being fed into the national electricity grid. In 2017, total revenue for electricity production was $120 million (RON 505.81 million), representing a 38 percent increase in total income compared to 2016.

It served briefly postwar with the RAF. Design and development The DH.10 was designed by Geoffrey de Havilland to meet the requirements of Air Board Specification A.2.b for a single- or twin-engined day bomber.Mason 1994, p.106. It was a development of the earlier Airco DH.3 bomber, which had flown in 1916, but had been rejected by the War Office because of a belief that strategic bombing would be ineffective and that twin engines were impracticable.Mason 1994, p.48. The first prototype flew on 4 March 1918, powered by two 230 hp (186 kW) Siddeley Puma engines mounted as pushers.Thetford 1957, p.146. When evaluated by the RAF, the performance of this prototype was well below expectation, reaching only 90 mph (145 km/h) at 15,000 ft (4,572 m) with the required bomb load, compared with the specified .Jarrett Aeroplane Monthly September 1992, p. 15. Owing to this poor performance, the DH.10 was redesigned with more powerful engines in a tractor installation. The second prototype, known as the Amiens Mark II was powered by two 360 hp (268 kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engines and first flew in April 1918, showing greatly superior performance and proving to be faster than the DH.9A while carrying twice the bomb load. While shortages of the Eagle meant that the Amiens Mark II could not be put into production, it proved the design of the definitive aircraft, the Amiens Mark III, which was powered by the more readily available 395 hp (295 kW) Liberty 12 from America, as was the DH.9A. Following successful evaluation, large orders were placed, with a total of 1,291 ordered.Mason 1994, p.107. Operational history First deliveries of DH.10s went to No. 104 Squadron RAF in November 1918, flying a single bombing mission on 10 November 1918 before the Armistice ended the First World War. Postwar, DH.10s equipped 120 Squadron, which used them to operate an air mail service to the British Army of Occupation on the Rhine.Jackson 1987, pp.142‚Äì143. Amiens were also used by 97 Squadron (later renumbered 60 Squadron) which deployed to India. It provided support to the Army on the North-West Frontier, being used for bombing operations in the Third Anglo-Afghan war. DH.10s were also used by 216 Squadron in Egypt, where they provided an air mail service between Cairo and Baghdad, starting on 23 June 1921. Manufacturers Daimler were producing 80 a month by the end of 1918.

The terms 1955 system and one-and-a-half system are credited to Junnosuke Masumi who describes the system of 1955 as \\"a grand political dam into which the history of Japanese politics surge.\\" The years of Japan under 1955 regime witnessed the economic miracle, but also the dominance of the ruling party in the Diet, with an undergirded tight connection between the bureaucracy and the business sector. Due to a series of LDP scandals and the 1992 burst of Japanese asset price bubble, LDP lost its majority in the House of Representatives in the 1993 general election which effectively ended the 1955 system. But the JSP also lost much of support after it decided to form a coalition government with LDP in 1994, it dissolved in 1996.  Background  = Pre-1955 Multiparty System = House of Representatives Seat Distribution in 1947 After World War II, Japan was controlled by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP). SCAP aimed at the eradication of militarism and the promotion of democratization in Japan, and therefore it issued a series of policies to arrest suspected war criminals which shuffled the political power in Japan. The power of right-wing parties declined in the immediate post war periods due to the purge. The Japan Progressive Party lost about 90% of the seats in the purge, while the Japan Liberal Party lost about 45%. Meanwhile, since many parties on the left were only legalized under the command of SCAP after the WW2, they were barely influenced by the purge. As a result, the Japan Socialist Party led by Tetsu Katayama won the first general election after the enforcement of the constitution of Japan. Although at the time no formal regulations about how to form a coalition government existed, there was a consensus among the major parties that a coalition government should be formed to manage the post-war economic problems. Nonetheless, which party would be included in the coalition took a long process of negotiations. Both a four- party coalition excluding the Japan Communist Party (JCP) and a three-party coalition excluding both the Communist Party and the Liberal Party were suggested within the socialists. The Liberal party, led by anticommunist Shigeru Yoshida, showed great reluctance of joining the coalition. At a meeting between the Katayama and Yoshida on May 19, 1947, the Liberal Party asked Katayama to \\"break off with the leftists\\" in return of its participation in the coalition. Since the Socialist Party had already claimed to officially cut ties with the Communist Party earlier, it refused such demand. The lengthy coalition-building process ended up with a government headed by the Socialist Party, the Democratic Party, and the National Cooperative Party. The Katayama- led coalition government did not last more than a year due to opposition from both inside the Socialist Party and outside. In order to form a coalition, Katayama had to make concessions which departed from original policy proposals, which further facilitated the split between the leftist faction and the rightist faction within the party. At the same time, policies which Katayama did implement, such as nationalization of coal and mine production, drove the conservatives away. = Yoshida Hegemony = House of Representatives Seat Distribution in 1949 After the failure of Katayama cabinet, voters lost confidence in the Socialist Party, which led to the takeover of government by Yoshida Shigeru. In the general election of 1949, the Democratic Liberal Party led by Yoshida won a majority in the House of representatives with 269 seats out of 466 seats, while the Socialist Party won only 48 seats. This was the first majority cabinet in post-war Japan. Yoshida Shigeru organized five cabinets as a prime minister between 1946 and 1954. The diplomatic, economic, and security policies which Yoshida adopted when he was in power were altogether referred as the \\"Yoshida Doctrine\\". These policies remained influential even after him being voted out of the office by a no- confidence motion by the \\"Yoshida students\\" who followed his ideology. The Yoshida Doctrine has three major components: 1. Japan relies on its alliance with the U.S. for national security; 2. Japan preserves a low level of self- defense capacity; 3. Japan should concentrate on the reconstruction of domestic economy. The Yoshida Doctrine set the tone for Japan's economic miracle and alignment with the West. However, Yoshida's \\"one man\\" leadership and anti-communist stance was criticized and eventually led to the defection of many Diet members from his party to the new Democratic Party, causing his cabinet to resign on December 7, 1954. = Fall of Yoshida Shigeru = Dietmembers brawl due to the steamrolling of the amendment to the Police Act. The criticisms of Yoshida cabinet mainly focused on three issues: # In 1951, The San Francisco Peace Treaty and the Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan was signed under Yoshida cabinet. The Peace Treaty was signed without the communist bloc's presence, which was condemned by the Communist Party for its anti-communist stance. The Security Treaty was criticized by both the Communist Party and the Socialist Party for the risk of remilitarization, while also criticized by the conservatives for putting Japan in a subordinate position, since Japan was asked to provide military base for the U.S.'s force. # During the fifth Yoshida cabinet, several bills were passed with the strong opposition of the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan, including the Strike Control Act, the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement between Japan and the United States of America, two education acts which restrict the political participation of school teachers, amendment to the Police Act, Self-Defense Forces Act. Among which, the amendment to the Police Act was steamrolled with the opposition parties absent from the Diet. # The Yoshida cabinet was also involved in two major corruption cases. One is known as the . Masutomi Ito, the director of a financial institution Hozen Keizai Kai which, was accused of fraud and suspected of making political bribery, which resulted in the arrests of several conservative politicians. The other is known as the , in which the shipping business and shipbuilding business were proved to be making pay-off to conservative politicians. Influential politicians in the ruling party such as Eisaku Sato and Hayato Ikeda were suspected as bribe takers. The Yoshida cabinet reacted to this incident by stopping the arrest of Eisaku Sato. The three controversies led to the gathering of anti-Yoshida forces. On October 20, 1954, anti-Yoshida conservatives formed a coalition party: the Japan Democratic Party. The Japan Democratic Party along with the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan tabled a no- confidence motion against the cabinet on December 6 and won the majority. As a result, Yoshida Cabinet resigned on December 7 after six years of rule.  Establishment of the 1955 System  = Merger of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) = Within the Socialist party, ideological conflicts had long been a problem. The leftists in the party adopted a Marx-Lenin ideology as China, while the rightists leaned towards a socialist welfare nation under a capitalist system. The San Francisco Peace Treaty and the Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan signed in 1951 triggered the final split. The right socialists agreed on the San Francisco Peace Treaty but were against the Security Treaty, due to their constitutionalist stance, while the left socialists were against both treaties due to their exclusion of Soviet Union. On October 23, 1951, the old Socialist Party officially split into the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan. After the split, however, the socialists soon realized the necessity of merging into one party to fight against the anti-communist approach taken by the GHQ and the conservatives, which is commonly referred to as the . After the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, influential members from the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan came back from the purge and boosted the power of the rightists. The Leftist Socialist Party of Japan also expanded its power with the support of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, also known as . Meanwhile, the conservatives were suffering criticisms from the public for the corruption scandals and Security Treaty. Sensing the possibility of success, despite their ideological differences, to take power from the political right and fight against the anti-communist movement, the socialists decided to reunite and formed the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) on October 13, 1955. Before the merger: House of Representative Seat Distribution in 1955 One crucial external factor that caused the merger of JSD is Sohyo. Sohyo, the abbreviation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, was a trade confederation in Japan which was established on July 11, 1950, soon after the start of the Korean War. It incorporated about 48% of organized workers in Japan. Initially, Sohyowas the unified body of anti-communist unions, but it soon changed from a centralist stance to a left stance due to the remilitarization tendency of Japan shown in the Korean War. Due to the rationalization strategy taken by the conservative government, Japanese workers, particular those worked in small and median-sized factories were facing slow wage increase and even dismissals. In response, Sohyo organized the anti-rationalization campaign and pressured the merger of JSP. = Merger of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP) = After the merger: House of Representatives Seat Distribution in 1958In the 1955 general election, the conservative Japan Democratic Party won the ruling position. Meanwhile, the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan was able to win 17 more seats. The expansion of Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the soon formation of the leftists and rightists in the socialist camp into JSP became a more substantial threat for the conservatives. As a result, also in 1955, the Japan Democratic Party and the Japan Liberal Party merged as Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP). The expansion of the socialist power also worried the Zaikai(business community). Zaikai had incentives to secure a conservative government since it would pump money into the big companies to keep their competitiveness, stay in a close relationship with the U.S. to maintain a liberal trade policy, and deal with the intensified anti-rationalization labor movement. Therefore, to counter the socialist power, the Zaikai pressured the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party to merge. = Outcome of the merger: 1955 System = After the formation of the two major parties, JSP and LDP, a general election was held in 1958. Although the Socialist Party was gaining more power at the time, the conservative Liberal Party and Democratic Party had more voters from the beginning, and were able to consolidate support after their merger. As a result, the LDP won almost as twice as many seats as the JSP. The 1955 system, also known as \\"one and a half system,\\" was established, in which the LDP maintained its status as the dominant party, while the JSP was never able to muster enough support to seriously challenge it. The 1955 system centered around the two parties' confrontation over two major issues: the 1946 constitution and the Security Treaty. During the occupation years, Minister drafted the 1946 constitution under the demand of General Douglas MacArthur. Unsatisfied with the draft, SCAP revised it, and it served as the banner for SCAP's efforts to democratize and demilitarize Japan. The conservative parties had wished to revise the constitution since its enactment, particularly Article 9. At the same time, the socialist parties opposed any revision of the constitution. Another issue was the Security Treaty signed in 1951, a product of the late occupation years. Unlike the 1946 constitution, designed to wipe out militarism in Japan, the Security Treaty was the result of the U.S. wishing to secure its military strength in Asia to counter the communist threat in the Cold War. The JSP strongly opposed the Security Treaty due to fears of rearmament or a revival of militarism in Japan, while the LDP argued that the presence of the U.S. army in Japan was merely for self-defense. =Challenge to the 1955 System: the 1960 Anpo Protests= In 1960, the JSP and the JCP, working in coalition with the Zengakuren student federation, the S–æÃÑhy–æÃÑ labor federation, and a variety of civic groups, managed to mount the massive, nationwide Anpo Protests against the attempt by the LDP to revise the Security Treaty. Because of the size of the protests and dogged JSP opposition in the Diet, ratification of the revised treaty proved extremely difficult. After Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi forcibly rammed the new treaty through the Diet against the objections of several factions of his own party, it looked like the 1955 System was on the verge of collapse, as several LDP factions began making plans to bolt from the party. However, intense public outrage at Kishi's actions exploded in even larger demonstrations, and Kishi was forced to resign. Kishi was replaced as prime minister by Hayato Ikeda, who managed to tame factional rivalries and stabilize the 1955 System.  LDP dominance in the 1955 system  = Electoral system = The electoral system that was used under 1955 system is known as the Single Nontransferable Vote (SNTV). Under SNTV, each constituency has multiple seats to be filled. Voters instead of voting for parties, votes for individual candidates, and seats of the constituency go to whoever wins the most votes. One problem of such electoral system is that the fair allocation of seats to different parties are not taken into consideration: Since the winners of most votes eventually get the seats, candidates of one party can take all the seats of one constituency. Under such electoral system, LDP with its massive political donation put other opposition parties into disadvantage. Due to LDP's ties with big companies, the party directed the financial resources to individual candidates and enabled them to promise patronage to their voters, with a focus on the agricultural population, while the reallocation of Diet seats did not keep up with the migration from rural to urban area due to industrialization. Aside from the pork-barrel spending, the LDP candidates also cultivated personalism through Koenkai in their own constituency. Politicians went to the locals' wedding, funeral, birthday parties and so on. In such occasions, politicians often brought considerable amount of cash gift. Candidates would even organize activities such as hot springs for their supporters. On the account of its self-assertiveness, LDP unilaterally altered the rules for campaigning. Profiting off its constituted koenkai canvas, the competition rules were toughened for the Opposition. The formal campaign periods were short (and shortened further over time), television and radio advertising being prohibited and low limits placed on posters and handbills. Through the campaign, however, each candidate was granted two five-minute slots on television when a stream of candidates would line up and take turns in front of a stationary microphone to run through their list of promises right after which the next candidate would take other. Such rules of play were discouraging and difficult for a would-be challenger while LDP benefitted from the unfair restraints of participation by the sheer amount of runners. Another neglected flaw of the electoral system which bolstered LDP's dominance was the urgent need for redistricting in the wake of the post-war rapid population shifts from the rural to urban areas. The swelling urban populations were much trickier for LDP politicians to fit within the distributed koenkai grassroot structure as they were more peripatetic and atomized than the traditional rural household. These voters had new policy demands (ex. issues related to environmental deterioration in the 1960s) which conflicted with the ones practiced by LDP for their industry and big-business support. Under the obsolete district constituencies, the farmers retained disproportionate political influence which as a consequence of pork-barrel desires rather than by concern over issues of broad social policy, stagnated democratic alternation. Under the current electoral rules, LDP was motivated to develop loyal personal support for the farmer's voter group. Being a nationally organized group of voters and united around the single issue of agricultural protectionism, the party could tune higher import tariffs and subsidies to support the less productive small businesses which because of their large numbers, could turn out at elections and vote in predictable ways. = Bureaucratization of policymaking = Since the institution of the 1955 system, the legislative independence has been declining in the face of a growth in the combined legislative power of the bureaucracy and the ruling conservative party. Indicators that point to this are the success rates of governmental and individual member bills; the declining rate of amendments added; and the singular lack of success for opposition-sponsored bills. For example, the mere submission of nongovernmentally sponsored measures is extremely difficult. In the Lower House, at least 20 representatives must support a \\"member\\" bill before it can be introduced, while in the Upper House ten supporters are required. Moreover, should the bill require the expenditure of state funds, fifty and twenty supporters respectively are necessary. The chance for success of bureaucratic bills that was only 1.3 times greater than that for individual Diet-generated bills under the Occupation and about twice as great from 1952 to 1955, it augmented to 7 times greater by 1974, when approximately 90% of all successful legislation has been cabinet-sponsored. In addition, the Diet has not been notably active as a potential amender for which there are two devices open: it can either \\"amend\\" (shusei), or it can \\"add supplementary resolution of clarification\\" (futai ketsugi). From 1955 to 1960 just over one-third of all successful government legislation went through one or another of these processes. In the 48th Diet (1964-1965) this rate was 17% and in the 63rd Diet (1970) it was 15%. Finally, opposition bills had no chance of success: of 317 opposition bills introduced from the 37th (1960) through the 46th (1963-1964) Diets, not one became law. These numbers attest that by the time bills materialize in the Diet a general agreement has already been reached, both within and between the bureaucracy and the LDP. In such an environment, opposition and the generation of successful alternatives from within the Diet itself has become extremely difficult. Besides, the bureaucracy wields considerable and increasing power through the use of nonlegislative devices such a subordinances and communications, and through its varying degrees of dominance over technical and nonpartisan advisory groups. = Policy decision-making = The or \\"PARC\\" was the major policymaking body within the LDP. Its members were the LDP representatives in both legislative houses, and it was the basic forum in which the party discussed and negotiated government policy. The policymaking under this system did not comply with the usual model of a parliamentary cabinet government which involves strong cabinet leadership and coordination. Instead, representatives who were not in the cabinet were often the other pivot of policy through their formal roles PARC. In consultation with bureaucrats and interest groups, the council already had input into policy before the cabinet and prime minister or upper party executives could shape it further. At its height in the mid-1980s, PARC had as many as seventeen divisions.  Industrial policy  Japan's industrial policy under the 1955 system was undergirded by a political logic that supports firms and whole industries that would not have been sustainable in a less-regulated economy, imposed high prices and taxes, limited choice in the marketplace, and rigid career paths. In spite of the fact that Japan came out of war with a theoretical comparative advantage towards light manufacturing which would match its profile of low- capital, abundant-labor economy, the war skewed its economic profile toward heavy industries. The large war companies lobbied for a development strategy favoring heavy industry and received subsidies and regulatory favoritism. In exchange, LDP members were awarded with campaign contributions to be able to stay electorally competitive against each other in the multi-member districts. The Heavy Industries Bureau of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry assisted the heavy industries with policies such as: * Limiting entry and often regulating the market pricing to help stabilize profits. * Privileging access to cheap loans from the Japan Development Bank * Domestic government budget subsidies and tax breaks as well as favored access to foreign exchange and tariff protections. Such strategy of developmental policy which has strong state involvement in developmental orientation is typical of late industrialing countries and in terms of international political economy, follows the model of the developmental state. Explicit implication implies a degree of corruption, which during Kakuei Tanaka's office in 1971-1972 resulted in media noticing corruption which, in one instance, resulted in the Lockheed scandal.  The fall of the system  = Global Pressure and the Collapse of Bubble Economy = As a corollary of the Plaza Accord of 1985 when Japan agreed to allow substantial appreciation of the yen, the Japanese government reduced the interests marginally above the rate of inflation as a domestic relief strategy. This resulted in banks and corporations going on an enormous spending spree with nearly free money, bidding up the price of real estate and other assets. Against the faith of many people that Japan would come to dominate the world economy, the Japanese asset price bubble led to a bubble crash after the raising of interest rates of the Bank of Japan in 1990 and firms together with their jobs were in mortal danger. In this context and on the background of LDP's short-term relieved pressure from the already shaky electoral coalition between exporters and the non-traded sectors, the voting public expressed disenchantment toward the ruling LDP. The LDP lost its majority following the 1993 election. JSP joined the government with other seven opposition parties with exclude the JCP. But the coalition government only existed for 11 months. In June 1994, JSP formed a grand coalition with LDP. = After 1993 = House of Representatives Seat Distribution in 1993. LDP lost its majority for the first time after 38 years. SDP support collapsed after chose to form a grand coalition with LDP. The Democratic Party (DPJ) later succeeded JSP as the largest opposition party. The new electoral system following the 1994 Electoral reform which was claimed to reduce corruption and high elections costs, promote more policy debates, and encourage a two-party system. As a consequence of this reform as well as the change of voter behavior and the change of the international environment, the system collapsed completely following the 2005 and 2009 general elections which demonstrated significant shifts in both the foundations of party support and the importance of national swings in support for one party or another. Since 2005, urban-rural differences in the foundations of the leading parties have changed dramatically, and Japan has moved from a system dominated by locally based, individual candidacies toward a two-party system in which both party popularity and personal characteristics influence electoral success or failure. The specialist on theoretical knowledge of legislative institutions and electoral systems, Michael Thies, argues that majoritarian institutions of the Anglo-American variety would have pushed politics toward broader coalitions, reducing the premiums captured by organized groups with extreme preferences, and appealing more to the interests of unorganized, diverse voters. A study on the representation of unorganized groups under proportional representation (featuring multi-member voting-districts) concludes that closed-list proportional representation makes legislators generally more responsive to interest groups and less responsive to unorganized voters than single-member districts. An even representation would have given labor a persistent and politically potent voice of the kind seen in continental Europe.

As a young man, he moved to Norway as a Hungarian refugee, eventually moving to the United States to pursue a career as a pilot, which eventually led to a career in film. While he acted in mainstream films, he was a look-alike for Burt Reynolds and Sean Connery, which popularized him in adult films, including parodies. He started making porn at age 38 and retired in his sixties, with over 500 films in his canon. Described as a provocateur and Norway's most famous porn actor by Morgenbladet, the three-times-married Gabor was a womanizing alcoholic who played accordion, spoke eight languages, and was one of Ron Jeremy's best friends. Early life Gabor Sark√∏zy was born in 1945 in Hungary. He moved to Lillestr√∏m, Norway in 1957 as a refugee in the wake of the Hungarian Revolution. He left school and he played accordion, trumpet, and double bass for Cirkus Arnardo. He eventually moved to the United States, where he joined the United States Army and went to school to become an airplane pilot. Career Prior to acting, Gabor worked as a commercial airline pilot. Gabor eventually lost his commercial pilot license due to alcohol-related arrests. In the early 1980s, Gabor was acting in small parts in mainstream films in Los Angeles. He was a Burt Reynolds lookalike, which he capitalized on, including working as a stand in for Reynolds in films. In 1982, Gabor met Ron Jeremy while filming the Jerry Lewis comedy Cracking Up. Gabor and Jeremy saw each other again at an Adult Film Association of America gala in 1983. Attendees usually dressed in costumes and Gabor did his Burt Reynolds shtick including arriving in a black sports car complete with a vanity license plate reading \\"Bandit\\". Gabor told Jeremy he was interested in the porn industry and Jeremy introduced Gabor to his adult film industry contacts. He was 38 when he made his first adult film. Gabor acted regularly in films by Bobby Bouchard. He performed in Burt Reynolds parody porn films, using the stage name Turd Wrenolds. He co-starred in the Smokey and the Bandit parody All-American Girls in Heat. Gabor also had plastic surgery to appear more like Reynolds. Gabor was also a regular in Jeremy's films in the late 1980s, when Jeremy was a director for Leisure Time Entertainment. They filmed many films together, including 20 to 30 films on houseboats at Lake Mead with Samantha Strong and Tracey Adams, the result of having to film out of state due to obscenity laws in Los Angeles. Gabor's alcohol abuse often impacted his ability to get an erection, and Jeremy would often stand in for Gabor. Jeremy estimated that one-third of Gabor's films showed Jeremy's circumcised penis in lieu of Gabors uncircumcised penis. Jeremy would serve as one of Gabor's bestfriends throughout Gabor's life. He traveled frequently to Thailand, where he'd vacation and also get plastic surgery, which he documented in photographs. Gabor stopped dying his hair black and let it go gray and got plastic surgery to look more like Sean Connery. Back in the United States, he worked as a Connery lookalike outside of porn, attending special events. Gabor lived in Marina del Rey, California followed by Tampa, Florida. He retired from acting in 2001 and moved back to Norway after too many alcohol-related arrests and to escape from paying child support. In Norway, Gabor planned to direct the first Norwegian professional porn film. In 2007, Gabor said he was going to direct a S√°mi-themed adult film in Kautokeino, Norway. The film was never made. =Views on the film industry= Gabor believed pornographic films were beneficial for men and women to watch, suggesting one can learn that \\"there is no one way to make girls climax\\" and that one can \\"learn many things from porn movies.\\" Later life and legacy Gabor was an alcoholic, which Ron Jeremy called \\"the bane of [Gabor's] existence.\\" Gabor had been arrested for driving under the influence multiple times, having his license suspended indefinitely. After retiring in 2001, Gabor moved back to Norway. Norwegian journalist Alex Ros√©n featured Gabor in his documentary series People on the Move for NRK1. The film was supposed to be aired in February 2001, but was delayed until March due to the controversial nature of the program. The film featured Gabor participating in a gang bang. Gabor died of cardiac arrest on 27 June 2008 on vacation in Bangkok, Thailand. Gabor was married three times and had five children.

She was the first black female MNA and the youngest, as well as the first black cabinet minister in Quebec history. A member of the Quebec Liberal Party, she represented the multicultural riding of Nelligan in the Island of Montreal from 2004 to 2014. Biography James' father and mother are Canadian citizens who emigrated from St. Lucia and St. Vincent, respectively. She grew up in Montreal's West Island area and went to a francophone primary school. James says she first got involved in politics and with the Quebec Liberal Party during the 1995 Quebec sovereignty referendum campaign. James received a Bachelor's degree in civil law in 2000 from Universit√© de Montr√©al and a Bachelor's degree in common law from Queen's University in 2003. She was called to the Bar of Quebec in 2004. She was a political adviser at the Ministry of Health and Social Services and was the political aid of a former MNA for the Nelligan riding. She also collaborated in a local program which helped youths with learning difficulties.  Political career  She was first elected to the National Assembly of Quebec for the riding of Nelligan in a by-election held on September 20, 2004. She was re-elected in the 2007, 2008, and 2012 general elections. She was appointed Minister of Immigration and Cultural Communities in the minority government cabinet of Quebec Premier Jean Charest in 2007 following the initiative of Jean Charest to represent Anglophones and Cultural Communities in his Cabinet. After Tony Tomassi's sudden resignation in 2010, she was given an additional role in cabinet as Family Minister. In August 2010, she retained the Family portfolio in a cabinet shuffle, but lost her culture and immigration duties to Kathleen Weil. When Parti Qu√©b√©cois leader Pauline Marois demanded that the province of Quebec have full control over its immigration, James replied that under a bilateral agreement with the national government, Quebec already has all the power it needs to select the economic immigrants it wants. James publicly entered the controversy over reasonable accommodation by stating that she stood by her decree to bar students from covering their faces with niqabs or burqas in French-language classes. She claimed that \\"There is no ambiguity about this question. If you want to assist in [attend] our classes, if you want to integrate into Quebec society, here are our values. We want to see your face.\\" James' department decreed that Naema Ahmed leave CEGEP St. Laurent when Ahmed declined to remove her niqab during lessons. However, after James left provincial politics, she stated that her thinking on the niqab has evolved. The district of Saint Laurent, QC, where she sought a federal candidacy in a by-election, was 17-per-cent Muslim in the 2011 Census of Canada. On February 24, 2014, James announced she was leaving politics, and would not seek re-election in the 2014 election. On February 12, 2017, James confirmed on Twitter that would be seeking the Liberal Party of Canada's nomination for the Saint-Laurent federal electoral district. A 26-year-old high school teacher, however, defeated James for the Liberal nomination in that riding. Emmanuella Lambropoulos beat James and tax law professor Marwah Rizqy to secure the nomination. Political commentator James currently provides commentary to several CBC political programs, including as one of four former National Assembly ministers on the noonhour CBC Radio Canada program Le Club des Ex and as a member of the \\"Power Panel\\" on Power & Politics, an English-language political program on CBC News Network.

Beckett wrote it between October‚ÄìNovember 1976 \\"to replace a film of Play which the BBC had sent [him] for approval (and which he had rejected)\\" due to \\"the poor quality of the film\\". Donald McWhinnie directed Billie Whitelaw and Ronald Pickup. It was first broadcast on 17 April 1977 as part of a programme of three Beckett plays entitled 'Shades' on BBC2. It was first published in Ends and Odds (Faber) 1977. An early title for the piece was Poetry only love. Title The title comes from a phrase from the last verse of Yeats's near-solipsist poem, The Tower: ::: Now shall I make my soul, ::: Compelling it to study ::: In a learned school ::: Till the wreck of body, ::: Slow decay of blood, ::: Testy delirium ::: Or dull decrepitude, ::: Or what worse evil come - ::: The death of friends, or death ::: Of every brilliant eye ::: That made a catch in the breath - ::: Seem but the clouds of the sky ::: When the horizon fades; ::: Or a bird's sleepy cry ::: Among the deepening shades. Several months after the McWhinnie production in which he was himself heavily involved, Beckett had the opportunity to act as his own director in the German version, Nur noch Gew√∂lk, for S√ºddeutscher Rundfunk. In this production he made one or two minor changes but the main one was to include the whole last stanza above rather than the four lines in the original. \\"The Tower is a work which discusses history and the past not only in terms of recollection but also as an entire complex of traces, remainders and legacies of which individual subjective memory is only one element.\\" \\"The painful, highly personal question raised by Yeats is: if the poet's physical powers fail, if his vision and hearing are impaired, can the memory of the sensory world serve as a basis for poetry? Is memory alone capable of stimulating the creative act? ... As he draws upon his memory, revisiting scenes both in his life and works, he comes to respond affirmatively to the pessimistic question first raised ... The poet's physical impairments, paradoxically, prove a blessing. Indeed, in the stanza from which Beckett derived his title, Yeats puts the real world in perspective, thereby reducing his own sense of loss.\\" In a personal communication Beckett told Eoin O'Brien that this was one of Yeats's greatest lines. But why this particular line from the poem? Is it to do with the nature of clouds? \\"Clouds seem permanent but are ultimately impermanent; they cannot be touched, yet can be seen; they are nothing more than condensed water, yet remain a symbol of romance, of the imagination beyond practical measurement ‚Äì they are, in a phrase, at once here and elsewhere.\\" Structure =Characters= The director, Sidney Homan, defines the four 'characters' in this work: * M is the poet in reflective mode * M1 is the poet in his active mode in the world * W is his muse or the principle of poetry as it mediates between the material and the imaginative worlds * V is the poet's voice that comes from M or accompanies the movements of M1 and that searches for the heightened language prerequisite for poetry =Stages= Unlike Quad, which utilises a single fixed camera throughout, there are a total of sixty camera shots in this piece, \\"the shape of an hour or a minute\\", which can be organised into four groups or stages. There are only two televisual techniques used throughout the play: fade and dissolve. Stage 1 (Directions 1-19): The first stage focuses on the past, those times when the woman did appear and M could be creative as a consequence. Stage 2 (Directions 20-26): The second stage examines where the poet is presently. There are three areas, just offstage in the darkness. * West is the outside world in which he spends his days wandering. * East is his closet where he exchanges his greatcoat for his robe. * North, to the rear of the stage, is his sanctum in which, under the right conditions, he can be creative. Stage 3 (Directions 27-52): In the third stage the poet lists four possibilities: * The woman can appear and then vanish immediately. * The woman can appear and linger. * The woman can appear and 'speak' to him, i.e. inspire him. He uses the example where she mouths the words, \\"but the clouds,\\" and then vanishes. * The woman can fail to appear at all, the most common scenario. Stage 4 (Direction 53-60): In the final stage, the poet actually \\"finds success, almost as an ironic consequence of his despair. The woman appears and, this time, V is able to [recite] all four lines from Yeats's poem, rather than the truncated and hence frustrating single line of the television play's title.\\" Synopsis The play opens in darkness. It fades up to a shot from behind of M, a \\"man sitting on [an] invisible stool and bowed over [an] invisible table.\\" He is wearing his gown and nightcap. This is the only way we ever see him in the present, bowed over his table. The camera returns to this image fifteen times throughout the play. We hear a voice and assume it belongs to the man we are looking at, at least it is his thoughts we hear. He is remembering the circumstances under which he has seen the woman in the past. While he remembers we see M1, his remembered/imagined self, go through the motions described, at least what little actually takes place in the circle of light. He changes his mind about what causes her to appear. At first he says, \\"When I thought of her...\\" but he realises that is inaccurate; the woman simply appears to him, and always at night. He goes over his routine, carefully starting from his return home after walking the roads since daybreak:Both in his biography of Beckett (Damned to Fame p.634) and in a chapter within his book Frescoes of the Skull (p.261), James Knowlson draws a parallel with this man and the type of characters written by Synge. he enters, goes to the closet and swaps his greatcoat and hat for a nightgown and cap, then he enters his sanctum and tries to summon her, always without joy, whereupon at dawn he dresses again and heads out on the road. The voice lists the three instances listed above where the woman has appeared to him in the past. When he reaches the third one the camera cuts to the woman's face, \\"reduced as far as possible to eyes and a mouth\\", which mouths silently along with the voice, \\"...clouds...but the clouds...of the sky...\\" The man then realises there is a fourth case, but not really a fourth ' because so much of the time, by far the greatest amount of the time, nothing happens, the woman never even appears. Although from the opening scene it seems like he spends every night willing the woman to appear, this isn't the case. Sometimes he grows weary and occupies himself with other things that are \\"more ... rewarding, such as ... cube roots\\" or sits absorbed with nothing ‚Äì which he describes as a mine ‚Äì like the man in Film. We see M1 prepare for the road again and leave. The voice says, \\"Right,\\" then the woman's face appears once more and the voice repeats the final four lines of Yeats's poem. This time, however, the woman does not mouth the words. Her face dissolves, we are left with the man sitting at his invisible table where we began and everything fades to black. Interpretation In a number of other works Beckett has felt the need to split an individual into separate aspects of that character, e.g. Words and Music, where the writer, his words and his emotions are all represented by separate characters. \\"In ... but the clouds ..., however, Beckett is concerned not with fragments of the self, but the whole person. The protagonist, M, sees himself whole, (as at the end of Film) held in the light circle of the imagination ... The action of ... but the clouds ... consists of M reliving past experience with such intensity that he can see himself performing his daily routine.\\" The man is a poet, \\"caught in the writer's trap, the expectation of inspiration.\\" The woman seems to be his muse. It may be Beckett is personifying her as a woman only in the abstract sense but it is just as likely, considering Beckett's most famous writer-character, Krapp, that she is also a lost love, a once-literal muse. Krapp's imagination is impotent though. M has not reached that stage. He is still having occasional flashes of inspiration. And this must have been very much how the seventy- year-old Beckett felt himself; writing was becoming increasing difficult for him. Either way, \\"although not quite a character, she is ... both an object of desire and a force beyond desire.\\" Krapp sat at a real table and heard a real voice, albeit himself as a younger man. The man in ... but the clouds ... sits at an invisible table unable to write. Everything he encounters is outside a circle of dim, suffused light. This gives the play a dreamlike quality, the circle of light becomes a kind of 'no place' where this daily ritual takes place. The only voice is the one inside his head. Even the roads take on an abstract quality; they are neither to nor from anywhere unlike the travel options in Cascando, for example. Not all of Krapp's actions take place at his table, we hear him pouring drinks and attempting to sing in the darkness surrounding his stage as a means of distracting himself from the task in hand; in Quad, the players' only reality is within the lighted square as is the case with the women of Come and Go but in ... but the clouds ... all the real action takes place in the darkness, the central circle of light is a place of transition only. The fact that the woman may well have been real, rather than some stereotypical projection of M's ideal woman, is suggested by the line, \\"With those unseeing eyes I so begged when alive to look at me.\\" The camera focuses on the woman's face while these lines are spoken. Enoch Brater argues that \\"what he longs for is not the beloved but the image of his beloved, the evocative metaphor he has made of her. His is an exquisite despair. In his secret ceremony Beckett's male figure all but revels in it.\\" Because the old man realises he cannot physically recall his beloved, he makes do with simulation; he torments himself with memories of what it was like when she came before. M is not only trying to remember, he is trying \\"to remember the way in which he used to remember.\\" \\"For Beckett and for Yeats, there is a difference between remembering and not remembering, but both writers remind us that not remembering does not necessarily equal forgetting. That which is not consciously 'remembered' by an individual can still return to impose itself is a variety of ways, one of which both Yeats and Beckett qualify as a kind of haunting.\\" This makes one viewer's comment as to the nature of W all the more interesting when they call her \\"the character who appears but isn't really there ‚Äì she only gives the appearance of an appearance.\\" The man is a poet but he is also ‚Äì and unexpectedly ‚Äì a mathematician, a rational man. Numbers play a significant part in Beckett's works (particularly the number three as it was a favourite of Dante's). \\"M's addiction to numbers ‚Äì the four cases, the reference to cube roots, the two statistical possibilities given for the fourth case ‚Äì [can be] explained as a defensive posture. M must know that the woman's appearance is at random and defies logic. His careful efforts to establish mathematically the exact and proper conditions for her appearance are merely an attempt to give order to an experience he knows, deep inside, is beyond rational measurement or prediction.\\" He would prefer that the woman appears when he thinks of her, that there should exist a clear correlation between conscious thought and realisation but his is not the case. He is forced to modify the theory he is testing acknowledging that the woman's face merely \\"appeared\\" and those appearances were always at night. By the end of the play \\"he has done all he can do, he is now at the mercy of Providence. The woman will appear if, pleased with his efforts, she decides to appear.\\" There is an element of ritual to the piece, another common element of Beckett's theatre. Perhaps it is the only way he can feel he can retain some element of control over ‚Äì or at least involvement in ‚Äì the process. Enoch Brater suggests that ... but the clouds ... has more in common with Yeats than simply The Tower: : \\"Like the characters imagined in the play The Words upon the Window Pane, the 'he' we meet in ... but the clouds ... sits trance-like at a s√©ance, calling out to a face and a voice to appear: 'Look at me' and then, echoing Hamlet's appeal to a quite different ghost, 'Speak to me.' A scene from Yeats is all but impossible to dismiss:\\" ::: Dr Trench: I thought she was speaking. ::: Mrs Mallet: I saw her lips move. \\"As Katharine Worth has pointed out, in Yeatsian terminology 'shades' [the final word of Yeats's poem] necessarily conjures up thoughts of spirits or ghosts along with the onset of evening, and Beckett's play only reinforces this somewhat understated .\\" The prevalence of 'ghosts' in Beckett's later writings hardly needs commenting on. John Calder in his review of the three plays shown on BBC2 had this to say about ... but the clouds ...: : \\"The man would appear ... to be immersed in guilt towards a missed opportunity, a dead love, a regretted course of action, as in Eh Joe, but with a flatter style. Irony is subdued, stoicism more matter of fact, self-pity almost entirely absent, illusion excluded. The man is concerned with concentration, a Merlin conjuring up a ghost in his memory.\\" Clearly the process in this play is open to interpretation. Is the process wholly internal, the man remembering someone real from his past or is he trying to conjure up some external manifestation of her, her ghost? And what is his motive for trying to evoke her? Is it simply to satisfy memory, to wallow in the moment awhile as Krapp does, or is she in some way his muse, an enabling force that makes the words come? Either way it is clear that he cannot control events directly, by the power of his will, things take place at best, as a byproduct almost of his actions, but more likely they are entirely out of his control and all he can do is wait on them.

Tolman played his college baseball at the University of Southern California and was drafted by the Houston Astros in the 12th round of the 1978 amateur draft. He reached the major leagues in 1981 after batting .322, hitting 14 home runs and having 99 runs batted in for the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League. His OPS was .927. In his seven major league seasons (with the Astros from 1981 through 1985, and the Detroit Tigers in 1986‚Äì1987), Tolman could never gain a regular job and hit only .168 for his career, never batting higher than the .196 he posted in 1983. Defensively, Tolman posted a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage in his major league career (135 putouts, 5 assists). He played two more seasons in the International League (for the Tidewater Tides in 1988 and the Syracuse Chiefs in 1989) before retiring. After his playing career, Tolman managed from 1991‚Äì1996 in the Astros' minor-league system. He was a scout in 1997‚Äì1999 and a scouting supervisor for the Astros in 2000‚Äì2002, then became minor league field coordinator for the Cleveland Indians from 2003 to 2006. Tolman was the third base coach for the Washington Nationals in and was the subject of criticism. Tolman was fired on September 28, 2008, after the final game of the 2008 season. On January 13, 2009, Tolman was named the Seattle Mariners coordinator of instruction. After the 2009 season, Tolman was hired as bench coach by new Cleveland Indians' new manager, Manny Acta, under whom Tolman had coached in Washington. The relationship between Tolman and Acta goes back to 1991, when Acta played for Tolman, who was managing the Burlington Astros of the Midwest League. Acta later served on Tolman's coaching staff. \\"He's a very bright baseball mind. I feel very comfortable with Tim,\\" Acta said. \\"He managed me in the minor leagues. I feel like he's a guy that can really help me. He's never been afraid to talk to me, and that is very important for a bench coach. He's also very familiar with our system, which we took into consideration.\\" Tolman retired from coaching following the 2011 season after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. During the final game of the season, Acta was ejected by home plate umpire Dan Bellino in the first inning after arguing balls and strikes, which resulted in bench coach Tolman managing the Indians for the rest of the game in his final game as a major league coach. Speculation was raised that Acta intentionally got himself ejected so Tolman could have the honor of managing the rest of the game, which Acta denied.

A member of the noble Kastrioti family, he was sent as a hostage to the Ottoman court. He was educated there and entered the service of the Ottoman sultan for the next twenty years. His rise through the ranks culminated in his appointment as sanjakbey (governor) of the Sanjak of Dibra in 1440. In 1443, during the Battle of Ni≈°, he deserted the Ottomans and became the ruler of Kruj√´, Svetigrad, and Modriƒç. In 1444, the council of feudal lords that historians would later call the League of Lezh√´ named Skanderbeg its chief military commander (first among equals). The league consolidated nobility throughout what is today Northern Albania, under King Alfonso V, with Skanderbeg as captain general. Thus, for the first time Albania was united under a single leader. Skanderbeg's rebellion was not a general uprising of Albanians, because he did not gain support in the Venetian-controlled north or in the Ottoman-controlled south. His followers additionally included, apart from Albanians, also Slavs, Vlachs, and Greeks. The resistance led by him nevertheless brought Albanians of different regions and dialects together in a common cause, helping define Albanian ethnic identity. Despite this military valor he was not able to do more than to hold his own possessions within the very small area in today's northern Albania where almost all of his victories against the Ottomans took place. Skanderbeg's military skills presented a major obstacle to Ottoman expansion, and many in western Europe considered him to be a model of Christian resistance against Muslims. For 25 years, from 1443 to 1468, Skanderbeg's 10,000-man army marched through Ottoman territory, winning against consistently larger and better-supplied Ottoman forces. He was greatly admired for this. Skanderbeg always signed himself in (\\"Lord of Albania\\"), and claimed no other titles but that in surviving documents. In 1451, through the Treaty of Gaeta, he recognized de jure the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Naples over Albania, ensuring a protective alliance, although he remained a de facto independent ruler. In 1460‚Äì61, he supported Ferdinand I of Naples in his wars against John of Anjou and the barons who supported John's claim to the throne of Naples. In 1463, he became the chief commander of the crusading forces of Pope Pius II, but the Pope died while the armies were still gathering. Together with Venetians, he fought against the Ottomans during the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1463‚Äì1479) until his death in January 1468. He ranks high in the military history of that time as the most persistent‚Äîand ever-victorious‚Äîopponent of the Ottoman Empire in its heyday.  Name  The original form of the surname, Castrioti (also as Castriothi in 1408), is rendered in modern Albanian historiography as Kastrioti. In correspondence with Slavic regions, ƒêuraƒë and ƒêorƒëe are used for his first name.; In 1450 his full name was written by his chancellor Ninac Vukosaliƒá in Old Slavic Cyrillic as ƒêuraƒë Kastriot Skenderbeg i Arbanija Gjergj is the Albanian derivative of the Latin name Georgius. Charles du Fresne (1610‚Äì1688), writing in Latin, used Georgius Castriotus Scanderbegus in his work. C. C. Moore in his biographical work on Skanderbeg (1850) used Castriot. The surname is derived from the Latin castrum via the Greek word Œ∫Œ¨œÉœÑœÅŒø (). According to Fan Noli, the surname is a toponym, of Kastriot in modern northeastern Albania. In 1463, his name was written in Latin as Zorzi Castrioti.\\"ambassador del signor Zorzi Castrioti dicto Scanderbego signor del Albania\\": The Ottoman Turks gave him the name ÿßÿ≥⁄©ŸÜÿØÿ± ÿ®⁄Ø ƒ∞skender bey or ƒ∞skender beƒü, meaning \\"Lord Alexander\\", or \\"Leader Alexander\\". Sk√´nderbeu, Sk√´nderbej or Skanderbeg are the Albanian versions, with Skander being the Albanian form of \\"Alexander\\". Latinized in Barleti's version as Scanderbegi and translated into English as Skanderbeg or Scanderbeg, the combined appellative is assumed to have been a comparison of Skanderbeg's military skill to that of Alexander the Great. Early life 160px There have been many theories on the place where Skanderbeg was born. One of the main Skanderbeg biographers, Frash√´ri, has, among other, interpreted Gjon Muzaka's book of genealogies, sources of Raffaele Maffei (\\"il Volterrano\\"; 1451‚Äì1522), and the Ottoman defter (census) of 1467, and placed the birth of Skanderbeg in the small village of Sin√´, one of the two villages owned by his grandfather Pal Kastrioti. Fan Noli's placement of the year of birth in 1405 is now largely agreed upon, after earlier disagreements, and lack of birth documents for him and his siblings. His father Gjon Kastrioti held a territory between Lezh√´ and Prizren that included Mat, Mirdit√´ and Dib√´r in north-central Albania. His mother was Voisava, whose origin is disputed. One view holds that she was a Slavic princess from the Polog region, which has been interpreted as her being a possible member of the Serbian Brankoviƒá family or a local Bulgarian noble family.; Strashimir Dimitrov: –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏ –ö–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–∏–æ—Ç–∏-–°–∫–µ–Ω–¥–µ—Ä–±–µ–≥ –∏ –Ω–µ–≥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–∞ –æ—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–Ω–∞ –±–æ—Ä–±–∞, –í: –ì. –ö–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–∏–æ—Ç–∏ –°–∫–µ–Ω–¥–µ—Ä–±–µ–≥ 1468-1968 –≥. –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, —Å–ø. \\"–ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω–∏\\", –ë–ê–ù, No2, 1970, —Å—Ç—Ä. 11: \\"It is known that his mother, Voisava, was of Slavic-Bulgarian origin, daughter of the lord of Polog, which is part of Macedonia and Bulgaria\\", says one anonymous Venetian chronicle...\\", cited by Antonina Zhelyazkova in The other view is that she was a member of Muzaka family, daughter of Dominicus alias Moncinus a relative of Muzaka house. Skanderbeg had three older brothers, Stanisha, Reposh and Constantine, and five sisters, Mara, Jelena, Angelina, Vlajka and Mamica. According to the geopolitical contexts of the time, John Castriot changed allegiances and religions when allied to Venice as a Catholic and Serbia as an Orthodox Christian. John Castriot later became a vassal of the Sultan since the end of the 14th century, and, as a consequence, paid tribute and provided military services to the Ottomans (like in the Battle of Ankara 1402).. In 1409, he sent his eldest son, Stanisha, to be the Sultan's hostage. According to Marin Barleti, a primary source, Skanderbeg and his three older brothers, Reposh, Kostandin, and Stanisha, were taken by the Sultan to his court as hostages. However, according to documents, besides Skanderbeg, only one of the brothers of Skanderbeg, probably Stanisha, was taken hostage and had been conscripted into the Dev≈üirme system, a military institute that enrolled Christian boys, converted them to Islam, and trained them to become military officers. Recent historians are of the opinion that while Stanisha might have been conscripted at a young age, and had to go through the Dev≈üirme, this was not the case with Skanderbeg, who is assumed to have been sent hostage to the Sultan by his father only at the age of 18. It was customary at the time that a local chieftain, who had been defeated by the Sultan, would send one of his children to the Sultan's court, where the child would be a hostage for an unspecified time; this way, the Sultan was able to exercise control in the area ruled by the hostage's father. The treatment of the hostages was not bad. Far from being held in a prison, the hostages were usually sent to the best military schools and trained to become future military leaders. Ottoman service: 1423 to 1443 Enderun school Skanderbeg was sent as a hostage to the Ottoman court in Adrianople (Edirne) in 1415, and again in 1423. It is assumed that he remained at Murad II's court as i√ß oƒülan for a maximum of three years, where he received military training at Enderun. The earliest existing record of George's name is the First Act of Hilandar from 1426, when John Castriot and his four sons donated the right to the proceeds from taxes collected from two villages in Macedonia (in modern Mavrovo and Rostu≈°a, North Macedonia) to the Serbian monastery of Hilandar. Afterwards, between 1426 and 1431, John Castriot and his sons, with the exception of Stanisha, purchased four adelphates (rights to reside on monastic territory and receive subsidies from monastic resources) to the Saint George tower and to some property within the monastery as stated in the Second Act of Hilandar. After graduating Enderun, the sultan granted Skanderbeg control over one timar (land grant) which was near the territories controlled by his father. His father was concerned that the sultan might order Skanderbeg to occupy his territory and informed Venice about this in April 1428. In the same year John had to seek forgiveness from the Venetian Senate because Skanderbeg participated in Ottoman military campaigns against Christians. In 1430, John was defeated in battle by the Ottoman governor of Skopje, Ishak Bey, and as a result, his territorial possessions were extremely reduced. Later that year, Skanderbeg continued fighting for Murad II in his expeditions, and gained the title of sipahi. Several scholars have assumed that Skanderbeg was given a fiefdom in Nikopol in northern Bulgaria, because a certain \\"Iskander bey\\" is mentioned in a 1430 document holding fiefs there. Although Skanderbeg was summoned home by his relatives when Gjergj Arianiti and Andrew Thopia along with other chiefs from the region between Vlor√´ and Shkod√´r organized the Albanian revolt of 1432‚Äì1436, he did nothing, remaining loyal to the sultan. Skanderbeg dueling a Tatar at the Ottoman court, some time before 1439 In 1437‚Äì38, he became a suba≈üi (governor) of the Kruj√´ suba≈üilik before Hizir Bey was again appointed to that position in November 1438. Until May 1438, Skanderbeg controlled a relatively large timar (of the vilayet of Dhimit√´r Jonima) composed of nine villages which previously belonged to his father (registered as \\"Giovanni's land\\", ). According to ƒ∞nalcƒ±k, at that time Skanderbeg was referred to in Ottoman documents as Juvan oglu Iskender bey. It was because of Skanderbeg's display of military merit in several Ottoman campaigns, that Murad II (r. 1421‚Äì51) had given him the title of vali. At that time, Skanderbeg was leading a cavalry unit of 5,000 men. After his brother Reposh's death on 25 July 1431 and the later deaths of Kostandin and Skanderbeg's father (who died in 1437), Skanderbeg and his surviving brother Stanisha maintained the relations that their father had with the Republic of Ragusa and the Republic of Venice; in 1438 and 1439, they sustained their father's privileges with those states. During the 1438‚Äì43 period, he is thought to have been fighting alongside the Ottomans in their European campaigns, mostly against the Christian forces led by Janos Hunyadi. In 1440 Skanderbeg was appointed sanjakbey of Dibra. During his stay in Albania as Ottoman governor, he maintained close relations with the population in his father's former properties and also with other Albanian noble families. Rebellion against the Ottomans =Rise= In early November 1443, Skanderbeg deserted the forces of Sultan Murad II during the Battle of Ni≈°, while fighting against the crusaders of John Hunyadi. According to some earlier sources, Skanderbeg deserted the Ottoman army during the Battle of Kunovica on 2 January 1444. Skanderbeg quit the field along with 300 other Albanians serving in the Ottoman army. He immediately led his men to Kruj√´, where he arrived on 28 November, and by the use of a forged letter from Sultan Murad to the Governor of Kruj√´ he became lord of the city that very day. To reinforce his intention of gaining control of the former domains of Zeta, Skanderbeg proclaimed himself the heir of the Bal≈°iƒá family. After capturing some less important surrounding castles (Petrela, Prez√´, Guri i Bardh√´, Svetigrad, Modriƒç, and others) he raised, according to Frash√´ri, a red standard with a black double-headed eagle on Kruj√´ (Albania uses a similar flag as its national symbol to this day). Skanderbeg abandoned Islam, reverted to Christianity, and ordered others who had embraced Islam or were Muslim colonists to convert to Christianity or face death.. \\"This happened in 1443 when Gjergj Kastrioti (called Skenderbeg), who had been reared as a Muslim in the sultan's palace, abandoned the Islamic faith and publicly reverted to the creed of his forefathers. But this conversion was not merely a public gesture of defiance. It was the first act in a revolutionary drama. For, after changing his religious allegiance, Skenderbeg demanded that Muslim colonists and converts alike embrace Christianity on pain of death, declaring a kind of holy war against the sultan/caliph.\\" From that time on, the Ottomans referred to Skanderbeg as \\"hain (treacherous) ƒ∞skender\\". The small court of Skanderbeg consisted of persons of various ethnicities. Ninac Vukosaliƒá, a Serb, was the dijak (\\"scribe\\", secretary) and chancellor at the court., He was also the manager of Skanderbeg's bank account in Ragusa. Members of the Gazulli family had important roles in diplomacy, finance, and purchase of arms. John Gazulli, a doctor, was sent to the court of king Matthias Corvinus to coordinate the offensive against Mehmed II. The knight Pal Gazulli was travelling frequently to Italy, and another Gazulli, Andrea, was ambassador of the despot of Morea in Ragusa before becoming a member of Skanderbeg's court in 1462. Some adventurers also followed Skanderbeg, such as a certain John Newport, a Stefan Maramonte, ambassador of Skanderbeg in Milan in 1456, a certain Stjepan Radojevic, who in 1466 provided ships for a trip to Split, a certain Ruscus from Cattaro, and others. The Ragusan Gondola/Gunduliƒá merchant family had a role similar to Gazulli. Correspondence was written in Slavic, Greek, Latin, and Italian. Documents in Latin were written by notaries from Italy or Venetian territories in Albania.Schmitt Oliver Jens, \\"Skanderbeg et les Sultans\\", Turcica, 43 (2011) pp. 68, 69. Skanderbeg's return to Kruj√´, 1444 (woodcut by Jost Amman) In Albania, the rebellion against the Ottomans had already been smouldering for years before Skanderbeg deserted the Ottoman army. In August 1443, George Arianiti again revolted against the Ottomans in the region of central Albania. Under Venetian patronage, on 2 March 1444, Skanderbeg summoned Albanian noblemen in the Venetian-controlled town of Lezh√´ and they established a military alliance known in historiography as the League of Lezh√´. Among those who joined the military alliance were the powerful Albanian noble families of Arianiti, Dukagjini, Muzaka, Zaharia, Thopia, Zenevisi, Dushmani and Spani, and also the Serbian nobleman Stefan Crnojeviƒá of Zeta. Skanderbeg organized a mobile defense army that forced the Ottomans to disperse their troops, leaving them vulnerable to the hit-and-run tactics of the Albanians. Skanderbeg fought a guerrilla war against the opposing armies by using the mountainous terrain to his advantage. During the first 8‚Äì10 years, Skanderbeg commanded an army of generally 10,000‚Äì15,000 soldiers, but only had absolute control over the men from his own dominions, and had to convince the other princes to follow his policies and tactics. Skanderbeg occasionally had to pay tribute to the Ottomans, but only in exceptional circumstances, such as during the war with the Venetians or his travel to Italy and perhaps when he was under pressure of Ottoman forces that were too strong. A woodcut of the battle of Varna in 1444 In the summer of 1444, in the Plain of Torvioll, the united Albanian armies under Skanderbeg faced the Ottomans who were under direct command of the Ottoman general Ali Pasha, with an army of 25,000 men. Skanderbeg had under his command 7,000 infantry and 8,000 cavalry. 3,000 cavalry were hidden behind enemy lines in a nearby forest under the command of Hamza Kastrioti. At a given signal, they descended, encircled the Ottomans, and gave Skanderbeg a much needed victory. About 8,000 Ottomans were killed and 2,000 were captured. Skanderbeg's first victory echoed across Europe because this was one of the few times that an Ottoman army was defeated in a pitched battle on European soil. On 10 October 1445 an Ottoman force of 9,000‚Äì15,000 men under Firuz Pasha was sent to prevent Skanderbeg from moving into Macedonia. Firuz had heard that the Albanian army had disbanded for the time being, so he planned to move quickly around the Black Drin valley and through Prizren. These movements were picked up by Skanderbeg's scouts, who moved to meet Firuz. The Ottomans were lured into the Mokra valley, and Skanderbeg with a force of 3,500 attacked and defeated the Ottomans. Firuz was killed along with 1,500 of his men. Skanderbeg defeated the Ottomans two more times the following year, once when Ottoman forces from Ohrid suffered severe losses, and again in the Battle of Otonet√´ on 27 September 1446. = War with Venice: 1447 to 1448 = At the beginning of the Albanian insurrection, the Republic of Venice was supportive of Skanderbeg, considering his forces to be a buffer between them and the Ottoman Empire. Lezh√´, where the eponymous league was established, was Venetian territory, and the assembly met with the approval of Venice. The later affirmation of Skanderbeg and his rise as a strong force on their borders, however, was seen as a menace to the interests of the Republic, leading to a worsening of relations and the dispute over the fortress of Dagnum which triggered the Albanian-Venetian War of 1447‚Äì48. After various attacks against Bar and Ulcinj, along with ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá and Stefan Crnojeviƒá, and Albanians of the area, the Venetians offered rewards for his assassination. The Venetians sought by every means to overthrow Skanderbeg or bring about his death, even offering a life pension of 100 golden ducats annually for the person who would kill him. During the conflict, Venice invited the Ottomans to attack Skanderbeg simultaneously from the east, facing the Albanians with a two-front conflict. Woodcut depicting an engagement between Albanian and Ottoman forces On 14 May 1448, an Ottoman army led by Sultan Murad II and his son Mehmed laid siege to the castle of Svetigrad. The Albanian garrison in the castle resisted the frontal assaults of the Ottoman army, while Skanderbeg harassed the besieging forces with the remaining Albanian army under his personal command. On 23 July 1448, Skanderbeg won a battle near Shkod√´r against a Venetian army led by Andrea Venier. In late summer 1448, due to a lack of potable water, the Albanian garrison eventually surrendered the castle with the condition of safe passage through the Ottoman besieging forces, a condition which was accepted and respected by Sultan Murad II. Primary sources disagree about the reason why the besieged had problems with the water in the castle: While Barleti and Biemmi maintained that a dead dog was found in the castle well, and the garrison refused to drink the water since it might corrupt their soul, another primary source, an Ottoman chronicler, conjectured that the Ottoman forces found and cut the water sources of the castle. Recent historians mostly concur with the Ottoman chronicler's version. Although his loss of men was minimal, Skanderbeg lost the castle of Svetigrad, which was an important stronghold that controlled the fields of Macedonia to the east. At the same time, he besieged the towns of Durazzo (modern Durr√´s) and Lezh√´ which were then under Venetian rule. In August 1448, Skanderbeg defeated Mustafa Pasha in Dib√´r at the battle of Oranik. Mustafa Pasha lost 3,000 men and was captured, along with twelve high officers. Skanderbeg learned from these officers that it was the Venetians who pushed the Ottomans to invade Albania. The Venetians, upon hearing of the defeat, urged to establish peace. Mustafa Pasha was soon ransomed for 25,000 ducats to the Ottomans. Skanderbeg addressing the people, 16th-century engraving by Jost Amman On 23 July 1448 Skanderbeg crossed the Drin River with 10,000 men, meeting a Venetian force of 15,000 men under the command of Daniele Iurichi, governor of Scutari. Skanderbeg instructed his troops on what to expect and opened battle by ordering a force of archers to open fire on the Venetian line. The battle continued for hours until large groups of Venetian troops began to flee. Skanderbeg, seeing his fleeing adversaries, ordered a full-scale offensive, routing the entire Venetian army. The Republic's soldiers were chased right to the gates of Scutari, and Venetian prisoners were thereafter paraded outside the fortress. The Albanians managed to inflict 2,500 casualties on the Venetian force, capturing 1,000. Skanderbeg's army suffered 400 casualties, most on the right-wing. The peace treaty, negotiated by Georgius Pelino and signed between Skanderbeg and Venice on 4 October 1448, envisioned that Venice would keep Dagnum and its environs, but would cede to Skanderbeg the territory of Buz√´gjarpri at the mouth of the river Drin, and also that Skanderbeg would enjoy the privilege of buying, tax- free, 200 horse-loads of salt annually from Durazzo. In addition, Venice would pay Skanderbeg 1,400 ducats. During the period of clashes with Venice, Skanderbeg intensified relations with Alfonso V of Aragon (r. 1416‚Äì1458), who was the main rival of Venice in the Adriatic, where his dreams for an empire were always opposed by the Venetians. One of the reasons Skanderbeg agreed to sign the peace treaty with Venice was the advance of John Hunyadi's army in Kosovo and his invitation for Skanderbeg to join the expedition against the sultan. However, the Albanian army under Skanderbeg did not participate in this battle as he was prevented from joining with Hunyadi's army. It is believed that he was delayed by ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, then allied with Sultan Murad II, although Brankovic's exact role is disputed. As a result, Skanderbeg ravaged his domains as a punishment for the desertion of the Christian cause. He appears to have marched to join Hunyadi immediately after making peace with the Venetians, and to have been only 20 miles from Kosovo Polje when the Hungarian army finally broke.Malcolm, Noel. Kosovo: A Short History, 1998, pp 89‚Äì90 = Siege of Kruj√´ (1450) and its aftermath = In June 1450, two years after the Ottomans had captured Svetigrad, they laid siege to Kruj√´ with an army numbering approximately 100,000 men and led again by Sultan Murad II himself and his son, Mehmed II. Following a scorched earth strategy (thus denying the Ottomans the use of necessary local resources), Skanderbeg left a protective garrison of 1,500 men under one of his most trusted lieutenants, Vrana Konti, while, with the remainder of the army, which included many Slavs, Germans, Frenchmen and Italians,: \\"among whom were Slavs, Germans, Italians and others\\"; : \\"including many Slavs, Italians, Frenchmen and Germans\\" he harassed the Ottoman camps around Kruj√´ by continuously attacking Sultan Murad II's supply caravans. The garrison repelled three major direct assaults on the city walls by the Ottomans, causing great losses to the besieging forces. Ottoman attempts at finding and cutting the water sources failed, as did a sapped tunnel, which collapsed suddenly. An offer of 300,000 aspra (Ottoman silver coins) and a promise of a high rank as an officer in the Ottoman army made to Vrana Konti, were both rejected by him. First Siege of Kruj√´, 1450, woodcut by Jost Amman During the First Siege of Kruj√´, the Venetian merchants from Scutari sold food to the Ottoman army and those of Durazzo supplied Skanderbeg's army. An angry attack by Skanderbeg on the Venetian caravans raised tension between him and the Republic, but the case was resolved with the help of the bailo of Durazzo who stopped the Venetian merchants from any longer furnishing the Ottomans. Venetians' help to the Ottomans notwithstanding, by September 1450, the Ottoman camp was in disarray, as the castle was still not taken, the morale had sunk, and disease was running rampant. Murad II acknowledged that he could not capture the castle of Kruj√´ by force of arms before the winter, and in October 1450, he lifted the siege and made his way to Edirne. The Ottomans suffered 20,000 casualties during the siege, and many more died as Murad escaped Albania. A few months later, on 3 February 1451, Murad died in Edirne and was succeeded by his son Mehmed II (r. 1451‚Äì1481). After the siege, Skanderbeg was at the end of his resources. He lost all of his possessions except Kruj√´. The other nobles from the region of Albania allied with Murad II as he came to save them from the oppression. Even after the sultan's withdrawal, they rejected Skanderbeg's efforts to enforce his authority over their domains. Skanderbeg then traveled to Ragusa, urging for assistance, and the Ragusans informed Pope Nicholas V. Through financial assistance, Skanderbeg managed to hold Kruj√´ and regain much of his territory. Skanderbeg's success brought praise from all over Europe and ambassadors were sent to him from Rome, Naples, Hungary, and Burgundy. = Consolidation = The Ardenica Monastery, where Skanderbeg married Donika Although Skanderbeg had achieved success in resisting Murad II himself, harvests were unproductive and famine was widespread. After being rejected by the Venetians, Skanderbeg established closer connections with King Alfonso V who, in January 1451, appointed him as \\"captain general of the king of Aragon\\". Following Skanderbeg's requests, King Alfonso V helped him in this situation and the two parties signed the Treaty of Gaeta on 26 March 1451, according to which Skanderbeg was formally a vassal in exchange for military aid. Authors have disagreed on whether Kruj√´ belonged to Skanderbeg or to Alfonso V; while C. Marinesco claimed that Kruj√´ no longer belonged to Skanderbeg, but to Alfonso, who exercised his power through his viceroy, this thesis was rejected by A. Gegaj, who claimed that the disproportion in numbers between the Spanish forces (100) and Skanderbeg's (around 10‚Äì15 thousand) clearly showed that the city belonged to Skanderbeg. It is presumed that Skanderbeg de facto had full control over his territories: while Naples' archives registered payments and supplies sent to Skanderbeg, they do not mention any kind of payment or tribute by Skanderbeg to Alfonso, except for various Ottoman war prisoners and banners sent by him as a gift to the King. More explicitly, Skanderbeg recognized Alfonso's sovereignty over his lands in exchange for help against the Ottomans. King Alfonso pledged to respect the old privileges of Kruj√´ and Albanian territories and to pay Skanderbeg an annual 1,500 ducats, while Skanderbeg pledged to make his fealty to King Alfonso only after the expulsion of Ottomans from his lands, a condition never reached in Skanderbeg's lifetime. Skanderbeg married Donika, the daughter of George Arianit Komneni, one of the most influential Albanian noblemen, strengthening the ties between them, a month after the treaty on 21 April 1451 in the Orthodox Ardenica Monastery, Their only child was John Castriot II. In 1451, Mehmed was focused on defeating the Karamanids and Mente≈üe in the East, but it was in his intentions to return to Albania. During this brief period of rest, Skanderbeg took up the rebuilding of Kruj√´ and erected a new fortress in Modrica in the Drin Valley near Svetigrad (which had been lost in a 1448 siege) where Ottoman forces had previously slipped through unhindered. The fortress was constructed in the heat of summer within a few months when few Ottoman posts were present. This came as a huge blow to Ottoman efforts whose Albanian operations were thus inhibited. Right after the Treaty of Gaeta, Alfonso V signed other treaties with the rest of the most important Albanian noblemen, including George Arianit Komneni,Archive of Crown of Aragon, reg. 2691, 101 recto ‚Äì102 verso; Zurita: Anales. IV, 29 and with the Despot of the Morea, Demetrios Palaiologos.Archive of Crown of Aragon, reg. 2697, pp. 98‚Äî99 These efforts show that Alfonso thought about a crusade starting from Albania and Morea, which however never took place. Following the treaty, in the end of May 1451, a small detachment of 100 Catalan soldiers, headed by Bernard Vaquer, was established at the castle of Kruj√´. One year later, in May 1452, another Catalan nobleman, Ramon d'Ortaf√†, came to Kruj√´ with the title of viceroy. In 1453, Skanderbeg paid a secret visit to Naples and the Vatican, probably to discuss the new conditions after the fall of Constantinople and the planning of a new crusade which Alfonso would have presented to Pope Nicholas V in a meeting in 1453‚Äì54. During the five years which followed the first siege of Kruj√´, Albania was allowed some respite as the new sultan set out to conquer the last vestiges of the Byzantine Empire, but in 1452 the newly acceded Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II ordered his first campaign against Skanderbeg. An expedition was sent under the dual-command of Tahip Pasha, the main commander, and Hamza Pasha, his subordinate, with an army of c. 25,000 men split between the two. Battle of Polog, 1453 Skanderbeg gathered 14,000 men and marched against the Ottoman army. Skanderbeg planned to first defeat Hamza and then to move around Tahip and encircle him. Skanderbeg did not give Hamza much time to prepare and, on 21 July, he assaulted immediately. The fierce attack made short work of the Ottoman force, resulting in them fleeing. The same day Skanderbeg attacked Tahip's army and defeated them, with Tahip killed and the Ottomans were thus left without their commander as they fled. Skanderbeg's victory over a ruler even more powerful than Murad came as a great surprise to the Albanians. During this period, skirmishes between Skanderbeg and the Dukagjini family, which had been dragging on for years, were put to an end by a reconciliatory intervention of the Pope, and in 1454, a peace treaty between them was finally reached. On 22 April 1453, Mehmed sent another expedition to Albania under Ibrahim Pasha. The same day, despite the storms, Skanderbeg launched a swift cavalry attack which broke into the enemy camp causing disorder and chaos. Ibrahim was killed in action along with 3,000 of his men. Skanderbeg's army continued looting before returning to Debar. He returned triumphantly with his army with whom he had split his booty. Five weeks later Mehmed II captured Constantinople, which deeply troubled the Christian states of Europe. Mehmed, by then called \\"the Conqueror\\", turned his attention to finally defeating the Kingdom of Hungary and crossing into Italy. Skanderbeg informed King Alfonso that he had conquered some territories and a castle, and Alfonso replied some days later that soon Ramon d'Ortaf√† would return to continue the war against the Ottomans and promised more troops and supplies. In the beginning of 1454, Skanderbeg and the Venetians informed King Alfonso and the Pope about a possible Ottoman invasion and asked for help. The Pope sent 3,000 ducats while Alfonso sent 500 infantry and a certain amount of money to Skanderbeg.ASM, Carteggio gen. Sforzasco, ad annum 1454 Meanwhile, the Venetian Senate was resenting Skanderbeg's alliance with Naples, an old enemy of Venice. Frequently they delayed their tributes to Skanderbeg and this was long a matter of dispute between the parties, with Skanderbeg threatening war on Venice at least three times between 1448‚Äì58, and Venice conceding in a conciliatory tone. In June 1454, Ramon d'Ortaf√† returned to Kruj√´, this time with the title of viceroy of Albania, Greece, and Slavonia, with a personal letter to Skanderbeg as the Captain-General of the Neapolitan-aligned armed forces in parts of Albania (Magnifico et strenuo viro Georgio Castrioti, dicto Scandarbech, gentium armorum nostrarum in partibus Albanie generali capitaneo, consiliario fideli nobis dilecto). Along with d'Ortaf√†, King Alfonso V also sent the clerics Fra Lorenzo da Palerino and Fra Giovanni dell'Aquila to Albania with a flag embroidered with a white cross as a symbol of the Crusade which was about to begin. Even though this crusade never materialized, the Neapolitan troops were used in the Siege of Berat, where they were almost entirely annihilated and were never replaced. The citadel of Berat The Siege of Berat, the first real test between the armies of the new sultan and Skanderbeg, ended up in an Ottoman victory. Skanderbeg besieged the town's castle for months, causing the demoralized Ottoman officer in charge of the castle to promise his surrender. At that point, Skanderbeg relaxed his grip, split his forces, and departed the siege, leaving behind one of his generals, Muzak√´ Topia, and half of his cavalry on the banks of the Osum River in order to finalize the surrender. It was a costly error‚Äîthe Ottomans saw this moment as an opportunity for attack and sent a large cavalry force, led by Isak-Beg, to reinforce the garrison. The Albanian forces lulled into a false sense of security. The Ottomans caught the Albanian cavalry by surprise while they were resting on the banks of the Osum River, and almost all the 5,000 Albanian cavalry laying siege to Berat was killed. Most of the forces belonged to George Arianiti, whose role as Skanderbeg's greatest support diminished after the defeat. The attitude of other Albanian nobility was also somewhat affected. Second Battle of Oranik, 1456 Moisi Golemi defected to the Ottomans and returned to Albania in 1456 as the commander of an Ottoman army of 15,000 men, but he was defeated by Skanderbeg in the Battle of Oranik and lost his territory of Debar to Skanderbeg toward the end of March 1456. On 5 April 1456, Skanderbeg entered Kruja and Moisi fled to him professing his willingness to take up arms against the Ottomans, and Skanderbeg pardoned him, remaining loyal until his death in 1464. From time to time, Venice succeeded in stirring up Skanderbeg's relatives and weaker neighbors, who set up in opposition to him the elderly George Arianiti as \\"captain of all Albania\\" from Scutari to Durrazo in 1456, but in clan warfare Skanderbeg usually had the upper hand. Skanderbeg took over possessions of the Zenevisi and the Bal≈°iƒá as well. Skanderbeg's followers that ruled over northern Albania and all of the chieftains on both sides of the Tomor mountains remained loyal to him. Battle of Albulena, 1457230px In 1456, one of Skanderbeg's nephews, George Strez Bal≈°iƒá, sold the Modriƒç fortress (now in North Macedonia) to the Ottomans for 30,000 silver ducats. He tried to cover up the act; however, his treason was discovered and he was sent to prison in Naples. In 1456, Skanderbeg's son, John Castriot II, was born. Hamza Kastrioti, Skanderbeg's own nephew and his closest collaborator, lost his hope of succession after the birth of Skanderbeg's son and defected to the Ottomans in the same year. In the summer of 1457, an Ottoman army numbering approximately 70,000 men invaded Albania with the hope of destroying Albanian resistance once and for all. This army was led by Isak-Beg and Hamza Kastrioti, the commander who knew all about Albanian tactics and strategy. After wreaking much damage to the countryside, the Ottoman army set up camp at Ujebardha field, halfway between Lezh√´ and Kruj√´. After having avoided the enemy for months, calmly giving to the Ottomans and his European neighbours the impression that he was defeated, on 2 September Skanderbeg attacked the Ottoman forces in their encampments and defeated them killing 15,000 Ottomans, capturing 15,000 and 24 standards, and all the riches in the camp. This was one of the most famous victories of Skanderbeg over the Ottomans, which led to a five-year peace treaty with Sultan Mehmed II. Hamza was captured and sent to detention in Naples. After the victorious Battle of Uj√´bardha, Skanderbeg's relations with the Papacy under Pope Calixtus III were intensified. The reason was that during this time, Skanderbeg's military undertakings involved considerable expense in which the contribution of Alfonso V of Aragon was not sufficient to defray. In 1457, Skanderbeg requested help from Calixtus III. Being himself in financial difficulties, the pope could do no more than send Skanderbeg a single galley and a modest sum of money, promising more ships and larger amounts of money in the future. On 23 December 1457, Calixtus III declared Skanderbeg a Captain- General of the Curia (Holy See) in the war against the Ottomans. The Pope gave him the title Athleta Christi, or Champion of Christ. Main towns in Albania and surrounding regions during the 15th century Meanwhile, Ragusa bluntly refused to release the funds which had been collected in Dalmatia for the crusade and which, according to the Pope, were to have been distributed in equal parts to Hungary, Bosnia, and Albania. The Ragusans even entered into negotiations with Mehmed. At the end of December 1457, Calixtus threatened Venice with an interdict and repeated the threat in February 1458. As the captain of the Curia, Skanderbeg appointed the duke of Leukas (Santa Maura), Leonardo III Tocco, formerly the prince of Arta and \\"despot of the Rhomaeans\\", a figure known in Southern Epirus, as a lieutenant in his native land. On 27 June 1458, King Alfonso V died at Naples and Skanderbeg sent emissaries to his son and successor, King Ferdinand. According to historian C. Marinesco, the death of King Alfonso marked the end of the Aragonese dream of a Mediterranean Empire and also the hope for a new crusade in which Skanderbeg was assigned a leading role. The relationship of Skanderbeg with the Kingdom of Naples continued after Alfonso V's death, but the situation had changed. Ferdinand I was not as able as his father and now it was Skanderbeg's turn to help King Ferdinand to regain and maintain his kingdom. In 1459 Skanderbeg captured the fortress of Sati from the Ottoman Empire and ceded it to Venice in order to secure cordial relationship with Signoria. The reconciliation reached the point where Pope Pius II suggested entrusting Skanderbeg's dominions to Venice during his Italian expedition. After Serbian Despot Stefan Brankoviƒá was dethroned in April 1459, he travelled to Albania and stayed with Skanderbeg and supported his anti-Ottoman activities, forging plans to recapture Serbia from Ottomans and return to Smederevo.–°–ø—Ä–µ–º–∏—õ, –ú–æ–º—á–∏–ª–æ, –ë–æ—Ä–±–µ –∑–∞ –æ—Å–ª–æ–±–æ—í–µ—ö–µ –°–º–µ–¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤–∞ (1459‚Äì1485), –°–º–µ–¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏ –ó–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫ 3 (2011), 13‚Äì29. In November 1460 Despot Stefan married Angelina Arianiti, the sister of Skanderbeg's wife Donika. Skanderbeg gave the dethroned Despot Stefan an unknown estate as appanage. With Skanderbeg's recommendations, Despot Stefan moved to Italy in 1461 or 1466. = Italian expedition: 1460 to 1462 = Skanderbeg's military expedition to Italy 1460‚Äî1462. The Northern route was taken by himself, whereas the southern one was taken by his subordinates. In 1460, King Ferdinand had serious problems with another uprising of the Angevins and asked for help from Skanderbeg. This invitation worried King Ferdinand's opponents, and Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta declared that if Ferdinand of Naples received Skanderbeg, Malatesta would go to the Ottomans. In the month of September 1460, Skanderbeg dispatched a company of 500 cavalry under his nephew, Ivan Strez Bal≈°iƒá.Ferdinand's main rival Prince of Taranto Giovanni Antonio Orsini tried to dissuade Skanderbeg from this enterprise and even offered him an alliance. This did not affect Skanderbeg, who answered on 31 October 1460, that he owed fealty to the Aragon family, especially in times of hardship. In his response to Orsini, Skanderbeg mentioned that the Albanians never betray their friends and that they are the descendants of Pyrrhus of Epirus, and reminded Orsini of Pyrrhus' victories in southern Italy. When the situation became critical, Skanderbeg made a three-year armistice with the Ottomans on 17 April 1461, and in late August 1461, landed in Apulia with an expeditionary force of 1,000 cavalry and 2,000 infantry. At Barletta and Trani, he managed to defeat the Italian and Angevin forces of Orsini of Taranto, secured King Ferdinand's throne, and returned to Albania. King Ferdinand was grateful to Skanderbeg for this intervention for the rest of his life: at Skanderbeg's death, he rewarded his descendants with the castle of Trani, and the properties of Monte Sant'Angelo and San Giovanni Rotondo. =Last years= After securing Naples, Skanderbeg returned home after being informed of Ottoman movements. There were three Ottoman armies approaching Albania. The first, under the command of Sinan Pasha, was defeated at Mokra (in Makedonski Brod). Upon hearing of the defeat, Mehmed II dispatched a second army under Hasan Bey. Skanderbeg and Hasan confronted each other in Mokra where the latter was defeated and lost the majority of his forces as well as being wounded himself, he surrendered to Skanderbeg and was imprisoned. The second army, under the command of Hasan bey, was defeated in Ohrid, where the Ottoman commander was captured. The third Ottoman army, a force of 30,000 under Karaza bey was defeated in the region of Skopje. This forced Sultan Mehmed II to agree to a 10-year armistice which was signed in April 1463 in Skopje. Skanderbeg did not want peace, but Tanush Thopia's willingness for peace prevailed. Tanush himself went to Tivoli to explain to the Pope why Skanderbeg had opted for peace with Mehmed II. He pointed out that Skanderbeg would be ready to go back to war should the Pope ask for it.Skanderbeg's victory with the Venetians over the Ottomans in the 228x228pxMeanwhile, the position of Venice towards Skanderbeg had changed perceptibly because it entered a war with the Ottomans (1463‚Äì79). During this period Venice saw Skanderbeg as an invaluable ally, and on 20 August 1463, the 1448 peace treaty was renewed with other conditions added: the right of asylum in Venice, an article stipulating that any Venetian‚ÄìOttoman treaty would include a guarantee of Albanian independence, and allowing the presence of several Venetian ships in the Adriatic around Lezh√´. In November 1463, Pope Pius II tried to organize a new crusade against the Ottomans, similar to what Pope Nicholas V and Pope Calixtus III tried before. Pius II invited all Christian nobility to join, and the Venetians immediately answered the appeal. So did Skanderbeg, who on 27 November 1463 declared war on the Ottomans when a force of 14,000 was sent under the command of ≈ûeremet bey to reinforce fortresses in the area of Ohrid. Due to the upcoming crusade the Republic of Venice decided to aid Skanderbeg by sending 500 cavalry and 500 infantry under the condottiero Antonio da Cosenza, also known as Cimarosto. On 14 or 15 September after luring the Ottomans out of the gates of Ohrid and feigning a retreat, Skanderbeg's forces assaulted and defeated the Ottoman garrison. ≈ûeremet lost 10,000 men and his son was captured. The remainder of the Ottoman forces were pursued by the Albanian-Venetian ones. Pius II's planned crusade envisioned assembling 20,000 soldiers in Taranto, while another 20,000 would be gathered by Skanderbeg. They would have been marshalled in Durazzo under Skanderbeg's leadership and would have formed the central front against the Ottomans. However, Pius II died in August 1464, at the crucial moment when the crusading armies were gathering and preparing to march in Ancona, and Skanderbeg was again left alone facing the Ottomans. Andrea Domenico Fiocco), first printed in 1475. In April 1465, at the Battle of Vaikal, Skanderbeg fought and defeated Ballaban Badera, an Ottoman Albanian sanjakbey of Ohrid. However, during an ambush in the same battle, Ballaban managed to capture some important Albanian noblemen, including cavalry commander Moisi Golemi, chief army quartermaster Vladan Gjurica, Skanderbeg's nephew Muzaka, and 18 other officers. These were immediately sent to Constantinople where they were skinned alive for fifteen days and later cut to pieces and thrown to the dogs. Skanderbeg's pleas to have them back, by either ransom or prisoner exchange, failed. Later that same year, two other Ottoman armies appeared on the borders. The commander of one of the Ottoman armies was Ballaban Pasha, who, together with Jakup Bey, the commander of the second army, planned a double- flank envelopment. Skanderbeg, however, attacked Ballaban's forces at the Second Battle of Vajkal, where the Ottomans were defeated. This time, all Ottoman prisoners were slain in an act of revenge for the previous execution of Albanian captains. The other Ottoman army, under the command of Jakup Bey, was also defeated some days later in Kashari field near Tirana.  Second Siege of Kruj√´ and its aftermath (1466‚Äì67)  In 1466, Sultan Mehmed II personally led an army of 30,000 into Albania and laid the Second Siege of Kruj√´, as his father had attempted 16 years earlier. The town was defended by a garrison of 4,400 men, led by Prince Tanush Thopia. After several months of siege, destruction and killings all over the country, Mehmed II, like his father, saw that seizing Kruj√´ was impossible for him to accomplish by force of arms. Subsequently, he left the siege to return to Istanbul. However, he left the force of 30,000 men under Ballaban Pasha to maintain the siege by building a castle in central Albania, which he named Il-basan (modern Elbasan), in order to support the siege. Durazzo would be the next target of the sultan in order to be used as a strong base opposite the Italian coast.leftIn 1466, on his return trip to Istanbul, Mehmed II expatriated Dorotheos, the Archbishop of Ohrid and his clerks and boyars because of their anti-Ottoman activities and collaboration with rebels from Albania during Skanderbeg's rebellion. Skanderbeg spent the following winter of 1466‚Äì67 in Italy, of which several weeks were spent in Rome trying to persuade Pope Paul II to give him money. At one point, he was unable to pay for his hotel bill, and he commented bitterly that he should be fighting against the Church rather than the Ottomans. Only when Skanderbeg left for Naples did Pope Paul II give him 2,300 ducats. The court of Naples, whose policy in the Balkans hinged on Skanderbeg's resistance, was more generous with money, armaments, and supplies. However, it is probably better to say that Skanderbeg financed and equipped his troops largely from local resources, richly supplemented by Ottoman booty. It is safe to say that the papacy was generous with praise and encouragement, but its financial subsidies were limited. It is possible that the Curia only provided to Skanderbeg 20,000 ducats in all, which could have paid the wages of 20 men over the whole period of conflict. Second Siege of Kruj√´ 1466‚Äì67 ‚Äî The Albanian-Venetian force under Skanderbeg successfully repelled the siege led by Mehmed II. However, on his return he allied with Lek√´ Dukagjini, and together on 19 April 1467, they first attacked and defeated, in the Krrab√´ region, the Ottoman reinforcements commanded by Yonuz, Ballaban's brother. Yonuz himself and his son, Haydar were taken prisoner. Four days later, on 23 April 1467, they attacked the Ottoman forces laying siege to Kruj√´. The Second Siege of Kruj√´ was eventually broken, resulting in the death of Ballaban Pasha by an Albanian arquebusier named George Aleksi. With the death of Ballaban, Ottoman forces were left surrounded and according to Bernandino de Geraldinis, a Neapolitan functionary, 10,000 men remained in the besieging camp. Those inside the encirclement asked to leave freely to Ottoman territory, offering to surrender all that was within the camp to the Albanians. Skanderbeg was prepared to accept, but many nobles refused. The Albanians thus began to annihilate the surrounded Ottoman army before they cut a narrow path through their opponents and fled through Dibra. On 23 April 1467, Skanderbeg entered Kruj√´. The victory was well-received among the Albanians, and Skanderbeg's recruits increased as documented by Geraldini: Skanderbeg was in his camp with 16,000 men and every day his camp grows with young warriors. The victory was also well received in Italy with contemporaries hoping for more such news. Meanwhile, the Venetians had taken advantage of Mehmed's absence in Albania and sent a fleet under Vettore Capello into the Aegean. Capello attacked and occupied the islands of Imbros and Lemnos after which he sailed back and laid siege to Patras. √ñmer Bey, the Ottoman commander in Greece, led a relief force to Patras where he was initially repelled before turning on his pursuers, forcing them to flee, ending their campaign.219x219pxAfter these events, Skanderbeg's forces besieged Elbasan but failed to capture it because of the lack of artillery and sufficient number of soldiers. The death of Skanderbeg ‚Äì 16th-century German engraving The destruction of Ballaban Pasha's army and the siege of Elbasan forced Mehmed II to march against Skanderbeg again in the summer of 1467. Skanderbeg retreated to the mountains while Ottoman grand vizier Mahmud Pasha Angeloviƒá pursued him but failed to find him because Skanderbeg succeeded in fleeing to the coast. Mehmed II energetically pursued the attacks against the Albanian strongholds while sending detachments to raid the Venetian possessions (especially Durazzo) and to keep them isolated. The Ottomans failed again, in their third Siege of Kruj√´, to take the city and subjugate the country, but the degree of destruction was immense. During the Ottoman incursions, the Albanians suffered a great number of casualties, especially to the civilian population, while the economy of the country was in ruins. The above problems, the loss of many Albanian noblemen, and the new alliance with Lek√´ Dukagjini, caused Skanderbeg to call together in January 1468 all the remaining Albanian noblemen to a conference in the Venetian stronghold of Lezh√´ to discuss the new war strategy and to restructure what remained from the League of Lezh√´. During that period, Skanderbeg fell ill with malaria and died on 17 January 1468, aged 62. Aftermath In Western Europe the death of Skanderbeg was mourned by princes and other rulers such as Ferdinand I. In a condolence letter written to Skanderbeg's widow dated 24 February 1468, Ferdinand expressed pain of having lost his friend and promised assistance to Skanderbeg's family. During Skanderbeg's lifetime, his assistance to King Alphonse I by sending troops to quell an uprising and later his expedition to suppress a revolt on behalf of King Ferdinand led to Albanian mercenaries and other soldiers being allowed by the Neapolitan monarchs to settle villages in Southern Italy. With the death of Skanderbeg and the conquest of his domains by the Ottomans, Albanian leaders and other Albanians found refuge in the Kingdom of Naples. These events and migrations contributed to the formation of the Arb√´resh community and many of their settlements in southern Italy that still exist in the modern era. Ivan Strez Bal≈°iƒá was perceived by Venice as Skanderbeg's successor. After Skanderbeg's death Ivan and his brother Gojko Bal≈°iƒá, together with Leke, Progon and Nicholas Dukagjini, continued to fight for Venice. In 1469 Ivan requested from the Venetian Senate to return him his confiscated property consisting of Castle Petrela, woivodate of \\"Terra nuova\\" of Kruje (unknown position), territory between Kruje and Durr√´s and villages in the region of Bushnesh (today part of the Kod√´r-Thuman√´ municipality). Venice largely conceded to the wishes of Ivan Bal≈°iƒá and installed him as Skanderbeg's successor. Siege of Shkod√´r 1478 After Skanderbeg's death, Venice asked and obtained from his widow the permission to defend Kruj√´ and the other fortresses with Venetian garrisons. Kruj√´ held out during its fourth siege, started in 1477 by Gedik Ahmed Pasha, until 16 June 1478, when the city was starved to death and finally surrendered to Sultan Mehmed II himself. Demoralized and severely weakened by hunger and lack of supplies from the year-long siege, the defenders surrendered to Mehmed, who had promised to allow them to leave unharmed in exchange. As the Albanians were walking away with their families, however, the Ottomans killed the men and enslaved the women and children. In 1479, an Ottoman army, headed again by Mehmed II, besieged and captured Shkod√´r, reducing Venice's Albanian possessions to only Durazzo, Antivari, and Dulcigno. Skanderbeg's son John Castriot II continued the resistance against the Ottomans, and tried to capture territories from Ottoman rule in 1481‚Äì84. In addition, a major revolt in 1492 occurred in southern Albania, mainly in the Lab√´ria region, and Bayazid II was personally involved with crushing the resistance. In 1501, George Castriot II, grandson of Skanderbeg and son of John Castriot II, along with Progon Dukagjini and around 150‚Äì200 stratioti, went to Lezh√´ and organized a local uprising, but that too was unsuccessful. The Venetians evacuated Durazzo in 1501. In 1594 there was a new attempt to liberate Albania from the Ottoman Empire. Albanian leaders gathered in Lezh√´ to plan a new revolt with the help of Pope Clement VII. But the Pope never sent his help, and the 40 thousand Albanian soldiers stoped their attept.Kuvendi i Sh√´nm√´ris√´, 1594, Radio Vatikani, 2009Revista Leka (1935-1936), Shkod√´r. Guiseppe Valentini After the fall of Albania to the Ottomans the Kingdom of Naples gave land and noble title to Skanderbeg's family, the Castriota. His family were given control over the Duchy of San Pietro in Galatina and the County of Soleto in the Province of Lecce, Italy. His son, John Castriot II, married Jerina Brankoviƒá, daughter of Serbian despot Lazar Brankoviƒá and one of the last descendants of the Palaiologos. There are two patrilineal branches of the Kastrioti family that exist today: the branch of Lecce with two sub-branches and the branch of Napoli with one sub-branch. Both branches are patrilineally descended from the sons of Ferrante (-1561), Duke of Galatina and Count of Spoleto. Legacy Selimie Mosque and St. Nicolas' Church) in Lezh√´ R. Caton Woodville, 17 January 1908. Skanderbeg on a 5000 lek note, the highest banknote in Albania The Ottoman Empire's expansion ground to a halt during the time that Skanderbeg's forces resisted. He has been credited with being one of the main reasons for the delay of Ottoman expansion into Western Europe, giving the Italian principalities more time to better prepare for the Ottoman arrival. While the Albanian resistance certainly played a vital role, it was one of numerous relevant events that played out in the mid-15th century. Much credit must also go to the successful resistance mounted by Vlad III Dracula in Wallachia and Stephen III the Great of Moldavia, who dealt the Ottomans their worst defeat at Vaslui, among many others, as well as the defeats inflicted upon the Ottomans by Hunyadi and his Hungarian forces. Skanderbeg is considered today a commanding figure not only in the national consciousness of Albanians but also of 15th-century European history. According to archival documents, there is no doubt that Skanderbeg had already achieved a reputation as a hero in his own time. The failure of most European nations, with the exception of Naples, to give him support, along with the failure of Pope Pius II's plans to organize a promised crusade against the Ottomans meant that none of Skanderbeg's victories permanently hindered the Ottomans from invading the Western Balkans. The mural of Skanderbeg in Piazza Scanderbeg in Rome, Italy In 1481 Sultan Mehmet II captured Otranto and massacred the male population, thus proving what Skanderbeg had been warning about. Skanderbeg's main legacy was the inspiration he gave to all of those who saw in him a symbol of the struggle of Christendom against the Ottoman Empire. Skanderbeg's struggle against the Ottomans became highly significant to the Albanian people. Among the Arberesh (Italo-Albanians) the memory of Skanderbeg and his exploits was maintained and survived through songs, in the form of a Skanderbeg cycle. \\"The memory of the Albanian national hero was maintained vividly among the Albanians of Italy, those who emigrated to Calabria and Sicily, following his death.... Living compactly in Christian territory, though in separate communities, the Italo- Albanians have preserved the songs about Skenderbeg and his exploits which their ancestors had brought from the mother country. Today one may even speak of the existence of a Skenderbeg cycle among them if one takes into account also the songs on other Albanian heroes who surrounded him.\\" During the Albanian National Awakening Skanderbeg also became a central symbol to the emerging Albanian nationalism of late 19th century, and a symbol of cultural affinity with Europe.Shinasi A. Rama, \\"Nation Failure, Ethnic Elites, and Balance of Power\\", Springer, 2019, pp. 94-95 It strengthened Albanian solidarity, made them more conscious of their identity, and was a source of inspiration in their struggle for national unity, freedom, and independence. Contemporary Muslim Albanians deemphasize the (Christian) religious heritage of Skanderbeg by viewing him as a defender of the nation and he is promoted as an Albanian symbol of Europe and the West.. The trouble Skanderbeg gave the Ottoman Empire's military forces was such that when the Ottomans found the grave of Skanderbeg in the church of St. Nicholas in Lezh√´, they opened it and made amulets of his bones, believing that these would confer bravery on the wearer. Indeed, the damage inflicted to the Ottoman Army was such that Skanderbeg is said to have slain three thousand Ottomans with his own hand during his campaigns. Among stories told about him was that he never slept more than five hours at night and could cut two men asunder with a single stroke of his scimitar, cut through iron helmets, kill a wild boar with a single stroke, and cleave the head of a buffalo with another. James Wolfe, commander of the British forces at Quebec, spoke of Skanderbeg as a commander who \\"excels all the officers, ancient and modern, in the conduct of a small defensive army\\". On 27 October 2005, the United States Congress issued a resolution \\"honoring the 600th anniversary of the birth of Gjergj Kastrioti (Scanderbeg), statesman, diplomat, and military genius, for his role in saving Western Europe from Ottoman occupation.\\" Fully understanding the importance of the hero to the Albanians, Nazi Germany formed the 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian) in 1944, composed of 6,491 Kosovo Albanian recruits. In literature and art Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi, Epirotarum principis by Marin Barleti Portrait of Scanderbeg, ca. 1648 There are two known works of literature written about Skanderbeg which were produced in the 15th century. The first was written at the beginning of 1480 by Serbian writer Martin Segon who was the Catholic Bishop of Ulcinj and one of the most notable 15th-century humanists, a short but very important biographical sketch on Skanderbeg (). Another 15th-century literary work with Skanderbeg as one of the main characters was Memoirs of a Janissary () written in the period of 1490‚Äì97 by Konstantin Mihailoviƒá, a Serb who was a janissary in the Ottoman Army. Skanderbeg gathered quite a posthumous reputation in Western Europe. In the 16th and 17th centuries, most of the Balkans were under the suzerainty of the Ottomans who were at the gates of Vienna in 1683 and narratives of the heroic Christian's resistance to the \\"Moslem hordes\\" captivated readers' attention in the West. Books on the Albanian prince began to appear in Western Europe in the early 16th century. One of the earliest was the History of the life and deeds of Scanderbeg, Prince of the Epirotes (; Rome, 1508), published a mere four decades after Skanderbeg's death, written by Albanian-Venetian historian Marinus Barletius, who, after experiencing the Ottoman capture of his native Scutari firsthand, settled in Padua where he became rector of the parish church of St. Stephan. Barleti dedicated his work to Don Ferrante Kastrioti, Skanderbeg's grandchild, and to posterity. The book was first published in Latin.Minna Skafte Jensen, 2006,A Heroic Tale: Edin Barleti's Scanderbeg between orality and literacy Barleti is sometimes inaccurate in favour of his hero, for example, according to Gibbon, Barleti claims that the Sultan was killed by disease under the walls of Kruj√´. Barleti's inaccuracies were noticed prior to Gibbon by Laonikos Chalkokondyles.see Laonikos Chalkokondyles, l vii. p. 185, l. viii. p. 229 He made up spurious correspondence between Vladislav II of Wallachia and Skanderbeg wrongly assigning it to the year 1443 instead of to the year of 1444, and also invented correspondence between Skanderbeg and Sultan Mehmed II to match his interpretations of events. Franciscus Blancus, a Catholic bishop born in Albania, also wrote Scanderbegs's biography, Georgius Castriotus, Epirensis vulgo Scanderbegh, Epirotarum Princeps Fortissimus published in Latin in 1636.Georgius Castriotus Epirensis, vulgo Scanderbegh. Per Franciscum Blancum, De Alumnis Collegij de Propaganda Fide Episcopum Sappatensem etc. Venetiis, Typis Marci Ginammi, MDCXXXVI (1636). French philosopher Voltaire held the Albanian hero in very high consideration in his works. Sir William Temple considered Skanderbeg to be one of the seven greatest chiefs without a crown, along with Belisarius, Flavius Aetius, John Hunyadi, Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, Alexander Farnese, and William the Silent. Ludvig Holberg, a Danish writer and philosopher, claimed that Skanderbeg was one of the greatest generals in history.; The Italian baroque composer Antonio Vivaldi composed an opera entitled Scanderbeg (first performed 1718), libretto written by Antonio Salvi. Another opera, entitled Scanderberg, was composed by 18th- century French composer Fran√ßois Franc≈ìur (first performed 1735).The Scanderberg Operas by Vivaldi and Francouer by Del Brebner In the 20th century, Albanian composer Prenk√´ Jakova composed a third opera, entitled Gjergj Kastrioti Sk√´nderbeu, which premiered in 1968 for the 500th anniversary of the hero's death. Skanderbeg is the protagonist of three 18th-century British tragedies: William Havard's Scanderbeg, A Tragedy (1733), George Lillo's The Christian Hero (1735), and Thomas Whincop's Scanderbeg, Or, Love and Liberty (1747).Havard, 1733, Scanderbeg, A Tragedy; Lillo, 1735, The Christian Hero; Whincop, 1747, Scanderbeg, Or, Love and Liberty. A number of poets and composers have also drawn inspiration from his military career. The French 16th-century poet Ronsard wrote a poem about him, as did the 19th- century American poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Gibbon, the 18th-century historian, held Skanderbeg in high regard with panegyric expressions. Giammaria Biemmi, an Italian priest, published a work on Skanderbeg titled Istoria di Giorgio Castrioto Scanderbeg-Begh in Brescia, Italy in 1742. He claimed that he had found a work published in Venice in 1480 and written by an Albanian humanist from Bar (now in Montenegro), whose brother was a warrior in Skanderbeg's personal guard. According to Biemmi, the work had lost pages dealing with Skanderbeg's youth, the events from 1443 to 1449, the Siege of Kruj√´ (1467), and Skanderbeg's death. Biemmi referred to the author of the work as Antivarino (\\"the man from Bar\\"), however, this was Biemmi's invention (a forgery) that some historians (Fan S. Noli and Athanase Gegaj) had not discovered and used as source in their works. Skanderbeg is also mentioned by the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro, Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, one of the greatest poets of Serbian literature, in his 1847 epic poem The Mountain Wreath,The Mountain Wreath, Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈° (Serbian) and in False Tsar Stephen the Little (1851).Psudo-Tsar Stephen the SmallFalse Tsar Stephen the Little, Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈° (Serbian) In 1855, Camille Paganel wrote Histoire de Scanderbeg, inspired by the Crimean War, whereas in the lengthy poetic tale Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812‚Äì1819), Byron wrote with admiration about Skanderbeg and his warrior nation. Serbian playwright Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá wrote and published a play based on Skenderbeg's life in 1828. Poet and president of Matica Srpska Jovan Subotiƒá wrote an epic poem inspired by battles led by Skenderbeg. The first poetic work on Skanderbeg in the Albanian language was composed by N. Frasheri and published in 1898.ŒìŒπŒøœáŒ¨ŒªŒ±œÇ Œ§ŒØœÑŒøœÇ (Yohalas Titos), ŒìŒµœéœÅŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ ŒöŒ±œÉœÑœÅŒπœéœÑŒ∑œÇ Œø Œ£Œ∫ŒµŒΩœÑŒ≠œÅŒºœÄŒµŒ∑œÇ (Georgios Kastriotis Œø Skenderbeis), p. 17, footnote 20. In Greek. The Great Warrior Skanderbeg (, ), a 1953 Albanian-Soviet biographical film, earned an International Prize at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival. The film was re-recorded and updated for high- definition for the 100th anniversary of Albanian independence. Skanderbeg Square in Tirana Skanderbeg's memory has been engraved in many museums, such as the Skanderbeg Museum next to Kruj√´ Castle. Many monuments are dedicated to his memory in the Albanian cities of Tirana (in Skanderbeg Square by Odhise Paskali),(in and outside Skanderbeg Museum by Janaq Pa√ßo) Kruj√´, and Peshkopi. A palace in Rome in which Skanderbeg resided during his 1466‚Äì67 visits to the Vatican is still called Palazzo Skanderbeg and currently houses the Italian museum of pasta: the palace is located in Piazza Scanderbeg, between the Fontana di Trevi and the Quirinal Palace. Also in Rome, a statue by florentine sculptor Romano Romanelli is dedicated to the Albanian hero in Piazza Albania. Monuments or statues of Skanderbeg have also been erected in the cities of Skopje and Debar, in North Macedonia; Pristina, in Kosovo; Geneva, in Switzerland; Brussels, in Belgium; London, in England; and other settlements in southern Italy where there is an Arb√´resh√´ community. In 2006, a statue of Skanderbeg was unveiled on the grounds of St. Paul's Albanian Catholic Church in Rochester Hills, Michigan. It is the first statue of Skanderbeg to be erected in the United States. His name is also commemorated in Skanderbeg Military University in Tirana; Sk√´nderbeu Stadium, home of KF Sk√´nderbeu Kor√ß√´; and the Order of Skanderbeg.

Alongside Colm McFadden and Christy Toye, he would have been considered one of the experienced members of the Donegal senior football panel in his final days. He lives in Letterkenny. He also played for Donegal Boston. Playing career Kavanagh attended Scoil Colmcille and St Eunan's College in Letterkenny. He played in the St Eunan's College team that won the McLarnon Cup for a third time in 2000, their first win since 1979. Mickey Moran first called up Kavanagh for the Donegal senior panel in 2001. Against Armagh in the 2004 Ulster final at Croke Park, he came on as a substitute for the injured Christy Toye. Against the same opponents at the same venue he played in the 2006 Ulster final, scoring 0‚Äì1. Having spent much of the campaign on the bench, he came on as a substitute in the 2007 NFL Final against Mayo, scoring 0‚Äì1. On 19 December 2008, he was named captain for the 2009 season. He made his 100th appearance for his county in the 2012 Ulster Senior Football Championship preliminary round match against Cavan and captained the team in the absence of the injured Michael Murphy. Again against Mayo, this time under the management of Jim McGuinness, Kavanagh started at midfield in the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle from his team hotel in Dublin the following morning, he was still a wee bit hoarse himself and described the win as \\"surreal\\". He was nominated for an All Star in 2012, but missed out unluckily, according to many experts. He won consecutive Ulster Senior Football Championships in 2011 and 2012. Against Derry in the 2011 Ulster SFC final, he went off injured late in the first half and was replaced by Martin McElhinney. He won his third and final Ulster SFC in 2014, appearing as a substitute for Christy Toye in the final against Monaghan. Kavanagh decided to retire from the county set up at the end of 2014. In 2016, he unretired himself and returned to the Donegal panel. In January 2017, Kavanagh finally retired from the inter-county game. It later emerged that much of this apparent indecisiveness was influenced by Rory Gallagher (McGuinness's assistant and, later, Donegal manager), who would lay in wait at Kavanagh's house and approach him as he returned home from school in efforts to attract him (both Rorys also bear a passing resemblance to each other). Training regime Until Jim McGuinness took over as team manager, Kavanagh was a frail and delicate sort of figure. McGuinness requested that he eat eight meals each day. McGuinness requested his consumption be in the form of an early breakfast, followed by lunch at 10.30, more food at 12:30, followed by more food at 3.00, more food at 6.00 and more food at 9.00. McGuinness also expected Kavanagh to eat half a tub of ice-cream if the player was not in satisfactory condition. Management career Kavanagh managed Donegal to the 2018 Buncrana Cup.

Productivity traditionally refers to the ratio between the quantity of software produced and the cost spent for it. Here the delicacy lies in finding a reasonable way to define software quantity. Terminology Productivity is an important topic investigated in disciplines as various as manufacturing, organizational psychology, industrial engineering, strategic management, finance, accounting, marketing and economics. Levels of analysis include the individual, the group, divisional, organizational and national levels [5]. Due to this diversity, there is no clear-cut definition of productivity and its influencing factors, although research has been conducted for more than a century. Like in software engineering, this lack of common agreement on what actually constitutes productivity, is perceived as a major obstacle for a substantiated discussion of productivity.Neal, A., Hesketh, B., Anderson, N., Ones, D. S., Sinangil, H. K., Viswesvaran, C. (ed.) Handbook of Industrial, Work and Organizational Psychology Productivity in Organizations. Sage Publications Ltd, 2002, 8-24 The following definitions describe the best consensus on the terminology.Tangen, S. Demystifying productivity and performance, International Journal of Productivity and Performance, 2005, 54, 34-36 =Productivity= While there is no commonly agreed on definition of productivity, there appears to be an agreement that productivity describes the ratio between output and input: Productivity = Output / Input However, across the various disciplines different notions and, particularly, different measurement units for input and output can be found. The manufacturing industry typically uses a straightforward relation between the number of units produced and the number of units consumed.Chew, B. W. No-Nonsense Guide to Measuring Productivity. Harvard Business Review, 1988, 66, 110-115 Non- manufacturing industries usually use man-hours or similar units to enable comparison between outputs and inputs. One basic agreement is that the meaning of productivity and the means for measuring it vary depending of what context is under evaluation. In a manufacturing company the possible contexts are: * the individual machine or manufacturing system; * the manufacturing function, for example assembly; * the manufacturing process for a single product or group of related products; * the factory; and * the company‚Äôs entire factory system As long classical production processes are considered a straightforward metric of productivity is simple: how many units of a product of specified quality is produced by which costs. For intellectual work, productivity is much trickier. How do we measure the productivity of authors, scientists, or engineers? Due to the rising importance of knowledge work (as opposed to manual work),Drucker, P. F. Knowledge-Worker Productivity: The Biggest Challenge. California Management Review, 1999, 41, 79-94 many researchers tried to develop productivity measurement means that can be applied in a non- manufacturing context. It is commonly agreed that the nature of knowledge work fundamentally differs from manual work and, hence, factors besides the simple output/input ratio need to be taken into account, e.g. quality, timeliness, autonomy, project success, customer satisfaction and innovation. However, the research communities in neither discipline have been able to establish broadly applicable and accepted means for productivity measurement yet.Ram√≠rez, Y. W., Nembhard, D. A. Measuring knowledge worker productivity: A taxonomy. Journal of Intellectual Capital, 2004, 5, 602-628 The same holds for more specific area of programming productivity. =Profitability= Profitability and performance are closely linked and are, in fact, often confused. However, as profitability is usually defined as the ratio between revenue and cost Profitability = Revenue / Cost It has a wider scope than performance, i.e. the number of factors that influence profitability is greater than the number of factors than influence productivity. Particularly, profitability can change without any change to the productivity, e.g. due to external conditions like cost or price inflation. Besides that, the interdependency between productivity and profitability is usually delayed, i.e. gains in productivity are rarely reflected in immediate profitability gains are more likely realized on the long-term. =Performance= The term performance is even broader than productivity and profitability and covers a plethora of factors that influence a company‚Äôs success. Hence, well-known performance controlling instruments like the Balanced Scorecard do include productivity as a factor that is central but not unique. Other relevant factors are e.g. the customers‚Äô or stakeholders‚Äô perception of the company. =Efficiency and Effectiveness= Efficiency and effectiveness are terms that provide further confusion as they themselves are often mixed up and, additionally, efficiency is often confused with productivity. The difference between efficiency and effectiveness is usually explained informally as efficiency is doing things right and effectiveness is doing the right things. While there are numerous other definitions, there is a certain agreement that efficiency refers to the utilisation of resources and mainly influences the required input of the productivity ratio. Effectiveness on the other hand mainly influences the output of the productivity ratio as it usually has direct consequences for the customer. Effectiveness can be defined as \\"the ability to reach a desired output\\". Generally, it is assumed, that efficiency can be quantified, e.g. by utilization rates, considerably more easily than effectiveness. =Quality= Tangen states: \\"Improvements in quality, other than the fact that no-fault products add to output levels, ought not to be included in the concept of productivity.\\" However, most of the classic literature in non-software disciplines, especially in the manufacturing area, does not explicitly discuss the role of quality of the output in the productivity ratio.Thomas, B. E. & Baron, J. P. Evaluating Knowledge Worker Productivity: Literature Review Construction Engineering Research Lab (USACERL), 1994 More recent works from non-manufacturing disciplines have a stronger focus on knowledge, office or white-collar work and hence increasingly discuss the role of quality with respect to quality.Al-Darrab, I. A. Relationships between productivity, efficiency, utilization, and quality. Work Study, 2000, 49, 97-104Saari, S. Productivity: Theory and Measurement. In Business Proc. of the European Productivity Conference (EPC), 2006Ray, P., Sahu, S. The Measurement and Evaluation of White-collar Productivity. International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 1989, 9, 28-47 Drucker stresses the importance of quality for the evaluation of knowledge worker productivity: \\"Productivity of knowledge work therefore has to aim first at obtaining quality‚Äîand not minimum quality but optimum if not maximum quality. Only then can one ask: \\"What is the volume, the quantity of work?\\"\\" Saari captures the importance of quality with his extended formula for productivity: Total productivity = (Output quality and quantity)/(Input quality and quantity) However, it appears that these efforts to include the quality in the determination of productivity did not lead to an operationalizable concept yet. It currently remains unclear how to quantify the vague terms ‚ÄúOutput quality and quantity‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúInput quality and quantity‚Äù, let alone to calculate the ratio. State-of-the-Art in Programming Productivity In software development things are more complicated than in the production of goods. Software development is an engineering process. =COCOMO II= Boehm was one of the first researchers that systematically approached the field of software productivity. His cost estimation model COCOMO ‚Äì now COCOMO IIBoehm et al. Software Cost Estimation with COCOMO II, 2000 \\\\- is standard software engineering knowledge. In this model, he defines a set of factors that influence productivity such as the required reliability or the capability of the analysts. These factors have been widely reused in other similar productivity approaches. The rest of the model is based on function points and finally source lines of code (LOC). The limitations of LOC as a productivity measure are well-known. =Jones's Software Productivity= Jones is the author of a series of books on software productivity. Besides several theoretical considerations his main contribution is the systematic provision and integration of a large amount of data relevant for productivity analyses. In at least two of his books, he gives a number of productivity factors but also points out that for each project a different set of factors are influential. These factors can form a basis for productivity assessments and for comparison with industrial averages. This is one such list: > The 20 factors whose quantified impacts on software projects have been > determined from historical data are the following: * Programming language > used * Program size * The experience of programmers and design personnel * > The novelty of requirements * The complexity of the program and its data * > The use of structured programming methods * Program class or the > distribution method * Program type of the application area * Tools and > environmental conditions * Enhancing existing programs or systems * > Maintaining existing programs or systems * Reusing existing modules and > standard designs * Program generators * Fourth-generation languages * > Geographic separation of development locations * Defect potentials and > removal methods * (Existing) Documentation * Prototyping before main > development begins * Project teams and organization structures * Morale and > compensation of staff =Function Points= Function points were proposed in 1977 by Albrecht as a better size measure for software than LOC. In that it is based on the specification of the software and thereby aims at measuring the size of its functionality rather than the code itself. The reason is that the size of the code not only depends on the size of the functionality but also on the capability of the programmer: better programmers will produce less code for the same functionality. The function points have undergone several redesigns over the years mainly driven by the International Function Point User Group (IFPUG). This group is large with over 1200 companies as member which shows the rather strong acceptance of this measure. However, in many domains it still lacks practical application because it is often conceived as only applicable to business information systems. =Value-Based Software Engineering= Several researchers proposed economic-driven or value-based software engineering as an important paradigm in future software engineering research. Boehm and Huang point out that is it not only important to track the costs in a software project but also the real earned value, i.e. the value for the customer.Barry Boehm, Li Guo Huang. Value-Based Software Engineering: A Case Study. IEEE Software, 2003 They explain that it is important to create the software business case and keep it up to date. In essence, value-based software engineering focuses on the customer value, mainly measured in monetary units. =Peopleware= The famous book Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams by de Marco and ListerTom DeMarco, Timothy Lister. Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams, 1987 brought the importance of people-related factors to the attention of a broader audience. They collected in many software projects experiences with good and bad management practice that have an influence on the productivity of the team. They and others showed that these are the decisive issues in software engineering but were only able to describe them anecdotally.  Factors influencing programming productivity  There are probably a large number of factors influencing the programming productivity of individuals and teams. For example, the used software development process probably influences the effectiveness and efficiency of a team. The personalities of software programmers influence the used coding styles which, in turn, influence the productivity of the programmers.

He was a political and religious radical who prospered during the years of the Parliamentary ascendancy and was an early settler of New England in North America. Life Rainsborowe's birth and early years are obscure. William's brother was the Leveller Thomas Rainsborough so it is more than certain he was born in Wapping London England. His father, William Rainsborough, was a captain and Vice-Admiral in the Royal Navy, and later Ambassador to Morocco (at which time he declined an Hereditary Knighthood).The Medallic History of England In later years William held Property in Wapping and Shadwell London.

At some point, William and his brother, Thomas Rainsborough, were both involved in an expedition to the other Puritan colony, Providence Island colony, off the coast of Nicaragua. Providence Island fell to the Spanish in 1641. Return to England in 1642 Rainsborowe was called back to England upon the death of his father in 1642. He married a woman named Margery Jenney of Suffolk upon his return and almost immediately went to serve in the Navy. When war broke out in Ireland during the Irish Rebellion of 1641, he was part of an expedition there. He subsequently became an officer in a cavalry unit in 1644. He and his brother, Thomas Rainsborough, were both Levellers and probably members of the congregationalist churches known at the time as \\"Independents\\" (who were generally more militantly anti-Catholic and opposed to the Established Church than the Puritans). The Battle of Naseby and The Putney Debates He fought in The Battle of Naseby on 14 June 1645 alongside his brother Colonel Thomas Rainsborough. In the New Model Army, he was a Captain serving for Colonel Thomas Sheffield as seen in the Naseby order of battle. However, his radicalism emerged early. In May 1647 in Saffron Walden Essex at a meeting with Parliamentary commissioners, he testified against Colonel Sheffield. Rainsborowe stated that the army was demoralised. He then outlined the complaints of his men. The army did not support their Colonel and Sheffield was afterwards removed. Rainsborowe was then promoted to the rank of Major under Colonel Thomas Harrison. The Saffron Walden Debates of May 1647 are considered the prelude to the Putney Debates of October 1647. In these debates the army wanted certain rights and freedoms. These debates and a Second English Civil War (1648‚Äì1649) would lead to the Commonwealth of England (1649‚Äì60) when England became a Republic. Rainsborowe showed his Leveller convictions during the army's Putney Debates at the end of October. William's brother, Thomas Rainborowe, was more fiery in his Leveller speeches, and he was murdered by Royalists in a bungled kidnap attempt in Doncaster in October 1648. William led the funeral, and a pamphlet called The Second Part of Englands New Chaines Discovered of that year discussed Rainsborowe's attempts at finding justice and the resistance of the upper classes. William Rainsborowe's cornet, according to the Dictionary of National Biography, was, during this time, a depiction of the severed head of Charles I and the motto salus populi: suprema lex (\\"let the good of the people be the supreme law\\").Pestana, Carla Gardina. \\"William Rainborowe.\\" In Matthew, H. C. G. and Brian Harrison, eds. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. vol. 45, 814‚Äì15. London: OUP, 2004. Radicalism and controversy In 1649, when issues surrounding the Leveller movement were at a head, Rainsborowe was removed from command. He was recommended for promotion twice in the 1650s, and each time the recommendation was over-ruled by the government. He hosted Ranters meetings, and he was arrested for paying for the publication of Laurence Clarkson's The Single Eye (1650). During the 1650s, Rainsborowe put his religious and political views into economic action. He purchased ecclesiastical lands, and he purchased the formerly Crown Estate of Higham Park now Higham Ferrers Northamptonshire. Rainborowe's wealth was extensive, for the estate was sold for ¬£5,498 in 1654. Arrest for treason The Rump Parliament made him a Colonel and had him raise a regiment in 1659, but the Rump itself was dissolved and overturned. Rainsborowe protested against this by signing A Remonstrance and Protestation of the Well-Affected People. Rainsborowe tried to sell the arms he had purchased for his militia. A political radical selling a great store of pistols just in the midst of a change from republicanism to a restored Monarchy and Crown was extremely provocative. This prompted his arrest on suspicion of treason in December 1660. This at the time of the Restoration. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London in December 1660, and then released on bail in February 1661. Major Rainsborowe joins a long List of prisoners of the Tower of London. Tower of London viewed from the River Thames Death Upon release on bail Rainsborowe left England. He does not enter public record again until his death in 1673 in Boston New England.

During the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, Ordubadi joined Muslim Social Democratic Party (Hummet). He then published Bloody Years about the clashes between Armenian and Azerbaijani populations in 1905. In 1918, he joined to Communist Party and his articles have published in the official newspaper of Hummet organization. He, along with XI Red Army, goes to Dagestan and publishes Red Dagestan magazine there. After the Sovietization of Azerbaijan he returns to Baku. Today, Ordubadi is remembered as one of the most important intellectuals of Azerbaijan during Soviet era. He served twice as a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR, the highest legislative institution in the country. His novels include Sword and the Pen, about the personality of Nizami Ganjavi, Foggy Tabriz about the Iranian constitutional revolution, also Mysterious Baku and Fighting City which both are about the revolutionary activities of Bolsheviks and 26 Baku Commissars.

Early life Harry Kirke Wolfe was born on November 10, 1858 to Jacob Vance Wolfe and Eliza Ellen Batterhorn in Bloomington, Illinois. Both of his parents were teachers. Before her marriage, Ellen Batterhorn taught in public schools and was eventually elected the chair of mathematics at Glendale Woman‚Äôs College in Glendale, Ohio. After their marriage Jacob Wolfe taught for many years in Illinois and in Gosport, Indiana. Harry was the oldest of their nine children, two of whom died before the age of two. When Harry was thirteen his family moved to a farm near Lincoln, Nebraska. As the eldest son Harry was responsible for working on the farm. He had a deep love of books and often read while walking behind the plow. [Benjamin, Ludy T. (1991). Harry Kirke Wolfe: pioneer in psychology. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.] Education Wolfe was in one of the first students to enter the then fledgling University of Nebraska. He arrived in a time of much controversy for the University, when people were unsure if the state could afford to support a university. There was much controversy within the university regarding the curriculum, which had expanded to include medicine, agriculture, and engineering as well as the establishment of mandatory chapel, military drill, and religious instruction. [Pedigogy in the University of Nebraska. North Western Journal of Education, 1895, 5, 269-270.] For an unknown reason Wolfe was excused for two of his four years of compulsory military drills. Wolfe studied a diverse range of topics during his schooling and after a rough start, he was a very successful student in his junior and senior years, earning nine A's and 3 B's. As a senior Wolfe took a course that would eventually have ties to his later career: a year-long mandatory class for all seniors on mental and moral philosophy. [Benjamin, Ludy T. (1991). Harry Kirke Wolfe: pioneer in psychology. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.] Wolfe earned his undergraduate degree from the university in 1880. Though he could have continued his education at one of many American graduate programs, Wolfe decided instead to travel to the University of Berlin, well-known at the time for its innovative curriculum. Upon arrival in Berlin, Wolfe began to pursue a degree in the classics with the intention of returning to the United States as a college or university professor. Very little is known about Wolfe‚Äôs three-year stay in Germany, though it is known that he took a course in psychology and a noter entitled ‚ÄúFundamentals of Experimental Psychology‚Äù in his second semester. Both classes were taught by Hermann Ebbinghaus. [Benjamin, Ludy T. (1991). Harry Kirke Wolfe: pioneer in psychology. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.] In the fall of 1884 Wolfe ended his time in Berlin, for unknown reasons, and traveled to Leipzig to study with Wilhelm Wundt. A possible explanation for this is that Ebbinghaus did not have professorial rank and was unable to supervise Wolfe‚Äôs doctoral thesis, which he would write in psychology, no longer pursuing a degree in classics. Wolfe was only the second American student to earn a degree under Wundt (the first being James McKeen Cattell).August 17 in Psychology at www.cwu.edu In 1886 Wolfe published his doctoral thesis on tonal memory. Wolfe chose to investigate retention by the method of recognition, a method that requires a stimulus to be present and the subject to make a judgment about the stimulus. This paradigm lends itself well to psychophysical methods which are what Wolfe used in his research on memory for tones. He believed that recognition memory was a simpler and more basic memory process that recognized objects or events as familiar or unfamiliar. Nearsightedness in the school. Northwestern Journal of Education, 1897, 7, 250-251 Career After his graduation from the University of Nebraska Wolfe spent the next three years teaching and working as a principal in three different Nebraska public schools. In the fall of 1889, Wolfe and his wife Katherine Brandt Wolfe (they married on December 16, 1888) returned to Nebraska where he was offered a position as chair of the philosophy department. Upon arrival he wasted no time in pressing that scientific psychology and education be added to the curriculum. His teaching courses in ‚ÄúGeneral Psychology‚Äù and then ‚ÄúExperimental psychology‚Äù led to the building of a psychology laboratory which was built partially in support of the class but also for Wolfe to conduct his own research in. In 1895 George Washington Andrew Luckey to the department was hired to teach pedagogy taking over some of Wolfe‚Äôs courses. At this time Wolfe added a new course ‚ÄúSeminar for Experimental Psychology‚Äù to the psychology curriculum. This course enabled him to gain for work he was already doing: directing original research projects for his students, each student was required to carry out a research experiment of their own design. [Benjamin, Ludy T. (1991). Harry Kirke Wolfe: pioneer in psychology. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.] Wolfe was a part of the founding of the Nebraska Society for Child Study which was formed in 1895. He was elected to the executive committee in one of the two at-large seats. They created an advisory board to assist in round tables and planning meetings and conducting research. One position on this board was ‚Äúprofessor of experimental psychology‚Äù a position clearly created in reference to Wolfe. In the years following the creation of the society Wolfe was a frequent speaker at local round tables, education meetings, to parent groups and at some commencement activities. He was a popular speaker, knowledgeable about the child study literature, and inspiring in his call for people to join the ‚Äúgreatest educational movement‚Äù the world has ever experienced. Defects of Sight. North Western Monthly, 1897, 8, 35-39. Wolfe also helped to found The American Journal of Psychology. He taught at the University of Nebraska until his death from a heart attack in 1918, which followed six weeks after he and other faculty were charged by the University of Nebraska Board of Regents with \\"hesitating, halting and negative support of the government\\" (during World War I). He and his fellow professors were accused of having ‚Äúimproper attitudes‚Äù, which communicated even unintentionally, might cause someone else, such as a student, to not support the war effort. This was seen as more than adequate cause for dismissal. Wolfe spent twenty-one and a half years as a college professor. During that time he worked largely with undergraduate students, although he did supervise some master's degree students in education after 1895 and some master's degree students in philosophy and psychology in 1906. Among Wolfe‚Äôs students were many who went on to be successful as attorneys, business owners and particularly as school teachers and administrators. Twenty-two of his students went on to become successful in the discipline of psychology. Three of Wolfe's students later served as presidents of the American Psychological Association.

Sharpe, 2002. and United Kingdom whose job was to separate impurities from coal by hand in a coal breaker. Although breaker boys were primarily children, elderly coal miners who could no longer work in the mines because of age, disease, or accident were also sometimes employed as breaker boys.This gave rise to a saying among coal miners: \\"Once an adult, twice a boy.\\" See: Miller, Donald L. and Sharpless, Richard E.

Mount Pleasant, S.C.: Arcadia Publishing, 2002. The use of breaker boys began in the mid-1860s. Although public disapproval of the employment of children as breaker boys existed by the mid-1880s, the practice did not end until the 1920s. Coal breaking Charles Green Coal came into wide use in the late 1590s in the United Kingdom after the island nation was widely deforested and a ban was placed on the harvesting of wood by Charles I of England so that forests could be used solely by the Royal Navy.Burke, James. Connections. New York: Little, Brown and Company, 1978, . p. 163-170. A newly emergent middle class increasingly demanded glass for windows, and the glass-making industry relied heavily on charcoal for fuel. With charcoal no longer available, this industry turned to coal. Demand for coal also increased after the invention of the reverbatory furnace and the development of methods for casting iron objects such as cannons. The first function of a coal breaker is to break coal into pieces and sort these pieces into categories of nearly uniform size, a process known as breaking.Ketchum, Milo Smith. The Design of Mine Structures. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1912. But coal is often mixed with impurities such as rock, slate, sulfur, ash (or \\"bone\\"), clay, or soil.Ash are impurities such as alumina, iron, silica, and other noncombustible materials. See: \\"Ash.\\" Dictionary of Energy. June 30, 2007. Accessed 2009-10-31. Thus, the second function of a coal breaker is to remove as many impurities as economically desirable and technologically feasible, and then grade the coal-based on the percent of impurities remaining. This was not necessary when coal was used in cottage-industry grade production methods, but became necessary when economies of scale moved production into early factories with a larger workforce and those installations began producing glass and iron in greater quantities. In the U.S. prior to 1830, very little bituminous coal was mined and the fuel of the early American Industrial Revolution--anthracite coal--underwent little processing before being sent to market, which was primarily ironworks and smithies producing wrought iron. The miner himself would use a sledgehammer to break up large lumps of coal, then use a rake whose teeth were set two inches apart to collect the larger pieces of coal for shipment to the surface.Korson, George Gershon. Black Rock: Mining Folklore of the Pennsylvania Dutch. Manchester, N.H.: Ayer Publishing, 1950. The smaller lumps of coal were considered non-marketable and left in the mine. Beginning about 1830, surface processing of coal in the U.S. began concurrently with various canal projects in the Eastern Seaboard. These developments lagged behind that of Great Britain, better matching the timing of similar developments in Continental Europe. Great Britain, with its heavily deforested landscapes, simply had to find economic alternatives sooner, stimulating coal, iron, and machine developments leading ultimately to railroads and the infant industrial chemicals industries of the 1860s. Lumps of coal were placed on plates of perforated cast iron and \\"breakers\\" would hammer on the coal until it was in pieces small enough to fall through the holes. A second screen caught the coal, and was shaken (by hand, animal, steam, or water power) to remove the unmarketable smaller lumps. This \\"broken and screened\\" coal was worth much more than \\"broken\\" coal or lump coal for the even sizes combusted with less trouble and need for tending once past the ignition point. Use of breaker boys Breaker boys in the 1880s picking slate from coal at a coal breaker in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Photo by George Bretz, 1880s Until about 1900, nearly all coal breaking facilities in the United States were labor-intensive. The removal of impurities was done by hand, usually by breaker boys between the ages of 8 and 12 years old.Freedman, Russell. Kids at Work: Lewis Hine and the Crusade Against Child Labor. Reprint ed.

For 10 hours a day, six days a week, breaker boys would sit on wooden seats, perched over the chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal.Miller, Randall M. and Pencak, William.

Breaker boys working on top of chutes or conveyor belts would stop the coal by pushing their boots into the stream of fuel flowing beneath them, briefly pick out the impurities, and then let the coal pass on to the next breaker boy for further processing.Bartoletti, Susan Campbell. Growing Up in Coal Country. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1999. Others would divert coal into a horizontal chute at which they sat, then pick the coal clean before allowing the fuel to flow into \\"clean\\" coal bins. The work performed by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys were forced to work without gloves so that they could better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only at the end of the working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid.When coal is mixed with water, a chemical reaction occurs that generates acid on the surface of the coal.Daniels, F.E. \\"Acid Pollution of Streams.\\" Journal of the American Water Works Association. 1921; \\"Stimulation of Free Settling by Electrolysis.\\" Mining and Metallurgy.

Public condemnation Breaker boys sort coal in an anthracite coal breaker near South Pittston, Pennsylvania, 1911. Public condemnation of the use of breaker boys was so widespread that in 1885 Pennsylvania enacted a law forbidding the employment of anyone under the age of 12 from working in a coal breaker, but the law was poorly enforced; many employers forged proof-of-age documentation, and many families forged birth certificates or other documents so their children could support the family. Estimates of the number of breaker boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly. One estimate had 20,000 breaker boys working in the state in 1880, 18,000 working in 1900, 13,133 working in 1902, and 24,000 working in 1907.\\"Install Mechanical Slate Pickers.\\" Technical World Magazine. September 1906-February 1907. Technological innovations in the 1890s and 1900s (such as mechanical and water separators designed to remove impurities from coal) dramatically lowered the need for breaker boys,\\"A Great and Efficient Coal Breaker.\\" New York Times. January 6, 1895. but adoption of the new technology was slow. By the 1910s, the use of breaker boys was dropping because of improvements in technology, stricter child labor laws, and the enactment of compulsory education laws. The practice of employing children in coal breakers largely ended by 1920 because of the efforts of the National Child Labor Committee, sociologist and photographer Lewis Hine, and the National Consumers League, all of whom educated the public about the practice and succeeded in obtaining passage of national child labor laws.Cohen, David and Wels, Susan.

Union activities Breaker boys were known for their fierce independence and rejection of adult authority. Breaker boys often formed and joined trade unions, and precipitated a number of important strikes in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania.Blatz, Perry K.

Pype Hayes is a modern housing estate area in the east of the Erdington district of Birmingham. It is within the Tyburn ward. Covering the postcodes of B76 and B24. Etymology The name of the area derives from a major landowner in Erdington called Henry de Pipe. On this land he built a house which later developed into Pype Hayes Hall. History Pype Hayes developed mainly during the 20th century as a result of the expansion of Erdington northwards towards the Chester Road. The Chester Road follows the line of the ancient drover's road called the Welsh Road. It developed during the 17th century as a major thoroughfare through Birmingham. Stage coaches used the road and it developed a reputation as a haven for highwaymen. All the land in Pype Hayes was owned as part of an estate with Pype Hayes Hall at its centre. This was a prominent hall in the area and the nearest settlement was Holifast Grange to the north-west. The construction of the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal in the south of Erdington prompted the establishment of industries near Tyburn, which is close to Pype Hayes. However, Pype Hayes remained unaffected by the industry. In the 20th century, Pype Hayes became the focus of residential developments for the expanding Erdington area. Also, the public wanted houses so that they could live near their workplaces at Tyburn. Eachelhurst Road was selected as a main housing development location. As Eachelhurst Road was on the boundary of Pype Hayes, the area remained relatively untouched. The houses were constructed between World War I and World War II and were of a semi-detached style. They were constructed of concrete and steel. The areas surrounding Pype Hayes developed quickly. Walmley in Sutton Coldfield expanded massively and Castle Vale to the south-east became a major industrial area with the construction of a large aerodrome. The landowners lost power within the area and so the Chester Road became developed. During the war, Pype Hayes was bombed, however, this was mainly haphazard bombing aimed at Erdington. Walmley Ash, nearby to Pype Hayes, witnessed 70-80 bombs being dropped on the area in just one night. Pype Hayes was extensively developed for council housing in the 1920s, as Birmingham City Council had recently started a huge process of rehousing people from inner city slums. More than 1,300 homes were built at Pype Hayes on land between Chester Road and Tyburn Road, with concrete walls and steel subframes - typical Dunlop Boswell style. The first school opened on the estate in 1928 - Paget Council School, which had capacity for 824 pupils aged 5‚Äì15 years. Gunter Road Council School was added in 1930 for 432 children aged 5‚Äì11 years, with wooden huts being added in 1930 and even the hall of St Mary's Church being used as an annex from 1952 to 1954 to cope with increased pupil numbers. By the 1980s, most of the houses at Pype Hayes were plagued with \\"concrete cancer\\" - a structural defect which renders buildings beyond repair. As with many large council housing estates, car crime, drugs, burglaries and \\"hooligan\\" behaviour were becoming a widespread problem. Also demolished as the Norton public house, which was replaced by a supermarket. It was soon decided that the defective homes all had to be demolished, and in 1992 the Pype Hayes Regeneration Programme began. Several tower blocks were built on Pype Hayes during the 1960s, as part of further rehousing from inner city slums, but these homes were no better than the older ones in the area, despite being some 40 years newer. They too would have to be demolished. On 7 July 2005 the council approved the demolition of properties 189-235 Pype Hayes Road, which were built by Dunlop Boswell. Demolition cost an estimated ¬£60,000. The last houses to be were demolished were around 2010-2011. The twelfth and final phase of the regeneration was approved by the Cabinet on 27 October 2003. The successful tender submission by Barratt Homes and Prime Focus was then approved in 2002.Birmingham City Council: Demolition of Dunlop Boswell Properties Most of the properties in Pype Hayes were demolished, with the exception of Sorrel House which was retained and refurbished, and were replaced with a modern housing development. The regeneration of Pype Hayes continues with Persimmon Homes completing the final phase in 2009, ending the estate's regeneration process which had lasted 17 years. Features and facilities Pype Hayes Hall remains today and was auctioned by Birmingham City Council in February 2012. It is now in private hands. The hall was sold in November 2013 for ¬£25,000 to private investors with plans to create a hotel and leisure complex. As of November 2019 the hall still lies derelict with no development .Surrounding the hall is a park called Pype Hayes Park which hosts a funfair and used to be the site for a large City Council funded bonfire and firework display to celebrate Guy Fawkes Night. This has not been held for a number of years due to cuts in City resources. Adjacent to the park is Pype Hayes Golf Course, which was opened in 1933. The two are separated by Plants Brook which flows beneath the Eachelhurst Road. At the Eachelhurst Road - Chester Road junction was a pub called The Bagot Arms. This closed in 2019 and is still empty with plans to turn the building into a steak house or restaurant. The parish church for Pype Hayes is St Mary's Church, which opened in 1929. Transport The A38 passes through the area. The road is used by several National Express West Midlands services which travel through Stockland Green to the Aston Expressway, or travel in opposite directions into Sutton Coldfield, Erdington, Walmley and Castle Bromwich.

The base of the distribution company was laid in 1975. Based on a government decision issued in 2000, The National Gas Company (Societatea Na≈£ionalƒÉ de Gaze Naturale Romgaz) was reorganised according to the services provided, thus resulting DistriGaz Nord, a company which was taken over by E.ON Group in June 2005, further to the acquisition of the majority of shares by E.ON Ruhrgas AG. Starting with April 2006, the company repositions itself on the specific market, by adopting a new trading name testifying its affiliation to E.ON Group, more exactly E.ON Gaz Romania. On 1 July 2007, in compliance with Romanian legal requirements aligned to the EU law, a legal separation of the supply activity from the distribution activity came into force. Thus, two legally independent companies were created: E.ON Gaz Rom√¢nia, natural gas supply company and E.ON Gaz Distribu≈£ie, natural gas distribution company. With a tradition traced back to over 30 years, E.ON Gaz Romania is one of the major players on this market, providing natural gas for more than 20 counties in the northern part of the country, the gas supply activity being performed in Transylvania, Moldavia and Banat. The customers of E.ON Gaz Romania, amounting to over 1.2 million, 95% thereof being residentials and 5% industrial customers, can be found in approximately 1,007 localities both in urban and rural areas, on a surface of approx. 122,600 km2. History of natural gas exploration On the present-day territory of Romania, the first natural gas deposit was discovered in 1908, in SƒÉrmƒÉ≈üel, Mure≈ü County (then in Austria-Hungary), further to geological researches on potassium salts. A prodigious period followed for the gas distribution business and the year 1941 marks the construction of the first natural gas pipeline from MƒÉne≈üti to Bucharest, while the following year a main pipeline is built for the transportation of natural gas from Transylvania to the capital city.

Saint Peters (St Pieterskerk), Utrecht, founded by Bernold in 1039. Saint Bernulf or Bernold of Utrecht (died 19 July 1054) was Bishop of Utrecht (1026/27-1054). Bernold succeeded Saint Adalbold as Bishop of Utrecht on 24 September 1027, when he was appointed by emperor of the Holy Roman Empire Conrad II. He was likely an official in Conrad's court prior to taking on the powerful post as Prince-Bishop: both an episcopal head and secular feudal lord within the Empire. A supporter of Conrad and his successor Henry III, Bernold was active church reform, helping to reduce episcopal power over monastic orders, helping to strengthen the Cluniac order in his domains, weakening lay lords control of churches and church land, and aiding the Holy Roman Emperor. For this, Conrad and Henry expanded his see, further angering local nobility. Bernold was friend of the future Emperor Henry III (succeeded Conrad in 1046), and traveled on Henry's 1041 campaign against the Hungarians. During Henry's visits to Utrecht in 1040 and 1042, he expanded the see. A brief rebellion led by Lorraine nobility in 1046 was defeated by Emperor Henry, and the Council of Aachen in 1049 saw Bernold's see expanded.Butler, p.151 Bishop Bernold established the Collegiate churches of Saint John (Janskerk) in 1040, Saint Peter (St Pieterskerk) in 1039, and St. Paul's Abbey and its church (St Pauluskerk).

The tribunal was set up on the orders of Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The National Awami Party, which the government banned on 10 February 1975. The Supreme Court of Pakistan, on 30 October 1975, held that the party was working for an independent Pakhtunistan and greater Balochistan at the cost of Pakistan's territorial integrity. It was ultimately wound up after General Zia-ul Haq overthrew Bhutto in 1977. A total of 52 people were arrested. Those arrested from the National Awami Party leadership included Khan Abdul Wali Khan, Khan Amirzadah Khan, Syed Muhammad Kaswar Gardezi, Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, Nawab Khair Bakhsh Marri, Mir Gul Khan Nasir, Sardar Ataullah Mengal, Habib Jalib, Barrister Azizullah Shaikh, Aslam Baluch (Shaysani), Aslam Kurd, Saleem Kurd, Sher Mohammad Marri (General Sherof), Najam Sethi, Saleem Pervez, Majid Gichki, Mir Abdul Wahid Kurd (read article) and Karnel Sultan Mengal. In addition, several members of the Muslim League and even prominent critics of Bhutto within his own Pakistan Peoples Party were also arrested.  Legal justification  The 3rd amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan was passed which gave wide legal scope to the state to define anti-state activities. Amendment of Article 10 of the Constitution. In the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, hereinafter referred to as the Constitution, in Article 10,‚Äî In clause (7), in the proviso, after the word ‚Äúenemy‚Äù, the commas and words ‚Äú, or who is acting or attempting to act in a manner prejudicial to the integrity, security of defense of Pakistan or any part thereof or who commits or attempt to commit any act which amounts to an anti-national activity as defined in a Federal Law or is a member of any association which has for its object, or which indulges him, any such anti-national activity‚Äù shall be added. = The London Plan = The alleged pretext for the banning was one of several incidents, it is alleged that Nawab Akbar Bugti on 31 January 1973, claimed at a public meeting at Mochi Gate, Lahore, that Wali Khan and Ataullah Mengal shared with him the \\"Independent Balochistan Plan\\", through which Balochistan could be placed \\"under the heel of one or more foreign power\\". He also reportedly claimed that the foreign headquarters supporting the \\"Greater Balochistan Plan\\" were located in Baghdad. This plus alleged evidence obtained from the Iraq Embassy was used as a pretext for the dismissal of the provincial government of Sardar Attaullah Mengal and the subsequent military intervention in Balochistan. = Assassination of Hayat Sherpao = In 1974, after Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's close ally and governor of the North-West Frontier Province Hayat Sherpao was killed in a bomb blast at Peshawar university. Bhutto became convinced that Khan Abdul Wali Khan and the National Awami Party were responsible.  Trial  The Tribunal was headed initially by Justice Aslam Riaz Husssain and subsequently by Justice Mushtak Ali Kazi, while the government was represented by Attorney General Yahya Bakhtiar, the defence counsel consisted of noted lawyers Mahmud Ali Kasuri and Abid Hassan Minto. As the trial went on NAP leader Khan Wali Khan withdrew from any defense arguing that the tribunal included biased judges and that a decision to convict had already been made.Newburg, Paula (2002) Judging the State: Courts and Constitutional Politics in Pakistan (Cambridge South Asian Studies). Cambridge University Press. pp 146‚Äì150 The hearings of the trial are now considered widely discredited for their one sidedness. In response to one of the charges before the Hyderabad Tribunal, that he had been sent Rs 20 million by Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi through a certain emissary, Wali Khan sarcastically filed a civil suit against the emissary for the recovery of the Rs 20 million. He argued that, although he could not imagine why Indira Gandhi would send him such a large sum of money, he had never received the money, and obviously the emissary had embezzled the money.Niazi, M.A. (27 January 2006) Wasted asset. The Nation. Nawa-e-Waqt Group. Available online at 2006/27/columns1.php  Government charges & rebuttal  The government used extensive means to validate the charges levelled against the NAP, while no proof was ever shown of the Party or its leaders role in the murder of Sherpao, a strong state run media smear campaign was launched which attributed any argument for the acquittal or release of the NAP leaders as anti-Pakistani.Press in chains (Unknown Binding) by Zamir Niazi (Author) 252 pages Publisher: Karachi Press Club (1986) ASIN: B0000CQIST Rejoinder in Supreme Court of Pakistan to written statement of Mr. Abdul Wali Khan, President of defunct National Awami Party, in reference by Islamic ...

This event was to force the latter towards striking an alliance in the Pakistan National Alliance and increase Bhutto's reliance on the Armed forces.

His ex-wife and mother of his 4 children contested that his estate be shared amongst the 4 children only. Having to fight the greed of theses other parties has left the family in a state of disrepair as only one humble party was willing to give their share back to the fatherless children. Smear campaign In 1993, Cliff Temple began an investigation into the conflicts of interest in the business affairs of Fatima Whitbread, the former world record-holder in the javelin and the then mistress of Andy Norman, the influential promotions officer of the British Athletic Federation (BAF). Norman threatened that if Temple did not stop asking awkward questions about Whitbread's business with the Chafford Hundred athletics club, he would spread unfounded allegations that Temple had sexually harassed a young woman athlete whom he coached. Temple carried on with his investigation, and Norman carried out his threat. In January 1994, three weeks before his 47th birthday, Temple committed suicide. Temple's body was found on the railway line at Sandling, not far from his home in Hythe, Kent. At the inquest into Temple's death the jury were given a transcript of a recording that Temple had made of a telephone interview with Norman in which the threat was made. In their verdict they said that the call had \\"push him over the edge.\\" Peter Radford, then executive chairman of the British Athletic Federation, said in April 1994: \\"So there is no doubt in anyone's mind, I have never heard any evidence of any kind that Cliff Temple ever engaged in any practice which could be construed as sexual impropriety. I would have to conclude that there should be no slur whatsoever on his good name and that his good name has been cleared.\\" Norman lost his high-profile job in British athletics soon after.

Biography  Yiannis Parios was born Ioannis Varthakouris (ŒôœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ ŒíŒ±œÅŒ∏Œ±Œ∫ŒøœçœÅŒ∑œÇ) on the island of Paros. He made his first appearance as a singer in 1969. He is quoted as saying ‚ÄúWhenever a song is born and wherever it is sung, it belongs to everyone. That, really, is the reason why music exists: so that it cannot be fenced in by frontiers‚Äù. This quote is thought to be the main inspiration for his songwriting and performances. Yannis Parios was the first Greek singer to perform Alain Barriere‚Äôs song ‚ÄúTu t‚Äôen vas‚Äù with Greek lyrics. Under its new title ‚ÄúTora pia‚Äù; the song was a gigantic hit, on an unprecedented scale for the time, and it marked the beginning of a new age in which many Greek singers adapted ‚Äúforeign‚Äù melodies to Greek lyrics. Yiannis Parios has worked with many of the leading Greek composers, including Manos Loizos, Yorgos Hadzinasios, Stavros Xarchakos, Stamatis Spanoudakis, Yorgos Katsaros, Marios Tokas, Yannis Spanos and Mikis Theodorakis. He has written lyrics of his own, and often composed music. A number of his songs have been translated and sung abroad, including the mega hit ballad Aporo, which is considered one of the most popular Greek songs. One of his releases holds the record for Greek sales (one million and four hundred thousand units): this was the album ‚ÄúNisiotika‚Äù, released in 1982 and consisting of a collection of songs of the Aegean islands which, as an islander himself, he may have learnt and first sang in childhood. Yiannis Parios has not confined appearances to Greece: He has also performed at Royal Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall and most of the major venues in Canada, Australia, the United States, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Turkey and Israel. Parios has four sons from two marriages. His oldest son, Harry Varthakouris, is an accomplished singer-songwriter himself.

Service  The regiment was created in response to Battle of Fort Sumter and President Abraham Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to serve for 3 months (the longest time allowed by the Constitution without Congressional approval). At the very beginning of the war the only place for Illinoisans to enlist was the state capital at Springfield. Because of this the majority of recruits were from Sangamon County. This included several militia companies that were already uniformed and partially trained; notably the \\"Springfield Grays\\" which made up Company I. The recruits were organized at Camp Yates on the outskirts of Springfield and mustered into Federal service by Captain John Pope on April 25th, 1861 for 90-days service. Camp Yates was located at the old Illinois State Fairgrounds site (currently the site of Dubois Elementary School). Throughout their training the men lived in the state fair's stables, which provided considerable comfort and relief from the elements. Despite being the first troops raised in Illinois, the regiment was numbered the 7th Illinois, paying homage to the six Illinois infantry volunteer regiments that were raised to fight in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War fourteen years earlier. During their service part of the regiment wore gray zouave uniforms with orange piping. Departing Camp Yates in May 1861, they went on duty at Alton, Cairo, Mound City, Illinois and then at St. Louis, Missouri until July, 1861. Companies \\"E\\" and \\"G\\" formed part of an expedition from Cairo to the Little River in Missouri on June 22 and 23. By the time the regiment was mustered out on July 25, 1861 and reorganized into the 7th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment (3 years). Some of the soldiers re- enlisted for 3 years, but most returned home and the new 7th Illinois barely resembled the original regiment.Dyer (1959), Volume 3 p. 1,046.

History The house was constructed by Moses Grinter where he and his half-Lenape (Delaware) wife lived until he died in 1878 and she in 1905. Grinter's wife's Indian name was ‚ÄúWindagamen,‚Äù which meant ‚ÄúSweetness.‚Äù She was one of about 25 Delaware women who became U.S. citizens when the territory became a state.\\"Delaware woman chose life as U.S. citizen\\", Wichita Eagle and Kansas.com, Nov. 1, 2010. Near this place, the Delaware Crossing (or \\"Military Crossing\\"; sometimes \\"the Secondine'\\") allowed passage from the old Indian trail where it met the waters of the Kaw River. Around 1831, Grinter, one of the earliest permanent white settlers in the area, set up the Grinter Ferry on the Kansas River here. His house, the Grinter Place, still stands. The ferry was used by individuals such as traders, freighters and soldiers traveling between Fort Leavenworth and Fort Scott on the military road. Others would cross this area on their way to Santa Fe. Grinter operated a trading post at the site and later in the home, the oldest remaining in Wyandotte County, between 1855 and 1860. The area was home to the first non-military post office in Kansas. The property remained in the family until 1950, when it was sold and became a chicken dinner restaurant until the mid-1960s. The property was bought by the state of Kansas in 1971. The site is administrated by the Kansas Historical Society as Grinter Place State Historic Site. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 25, 1971. Other activity By the 1820s, Fran√ßois Gesseau Chouteau's family, part of the American Fur Company, operated posts in this vicinity. Beginning in the 1830s, the Delaware tribe, the Wyandot tribe, Munsee tribe and the Shawnee tribe, all Eastern United States tribes, were relocated in this area. The Delaware agency, smithy, and Baptist and Methodist missions were located near the Grinter Place. Between 1863 and 1864, the Union Pacific Eastern Division built a railway through the area between the house and the Kaw River. In 1869, the Union Pacific constructed rails through the area and they continued on to the western border of the state. By the 1870s, the Eastern United States tribes were removed from the area and relocated further south to what is now the state of Oklahoma. Gallery MosesGrinterHouse.JPG1857 Grinter House.

In enterocoely, a mesoderm (middle layer) is formed in a developing embryo, in which the coelom appears from pouches growing and separating from the digestive tract (also known as the embryonic gut, or archenteron). As the incipient coelomic epithelium originates from archenteral diverticula, the endoderm therefore gives rise to the mesodermal cells. Diagram depicting a cross section of a deuterostome (vertebrate) embryo in the neurula stage. The location of the coelom is indicated.  Etymology  The term \\"enterocoely\\" derives from the Ancient Greek words (), meaning \\"intestine\\", and (), meaning \\"cavity\\". This refers to the fact that fluid-filled body cavities are formed from pockets related to the embryonic gut.  Taxonomic distribution  Enterocoely is the stage of embryological development of deuterostomes in which the coelom forms. This type of coelom formation occurs in deuterostome animals, which for this reason are also known as enterocoelomates. By contrast, in protostomes, the body cavity is often formed by schizocoely.  Embryonic development  Enterocoelous development begins once the embryo reaches the gastrula phase of development. At this point, there are two layers of cells: the ectoderm (outermost) and the endoderm (innermost) layers. The mesoderm begins to form as two \\"pockets\\" of tissue (one above the endoderm, and one below) are formed via folding of the endoderm. These \\"pockets\\" begin to grow larger, and as they do so, they extend towards each other. When the two \\"pockets\\" of cells meet, the mesoderm is formed ‚Äì a complete layer of tissue right in between the endoderm and ectoderm layers. This then leads to the formation of a coelom. The stage of coelom formation starts with the gastrula; as the archenteron forms, pockets of migrating cells also form, creating another layer between the endoderm and ectoderm, the mesoderm. These pockets gradually expand to form the coelom.

A member of the Irish Parliamentary Party and later a Parnellite, he was MP for North Kildare from 1885 to 1892, for Dublin College Green 1896‚Äì1900 and for South Meath from 1900 until his death in 1903. Early life Youngest son of Laurence Carew of Kildangan, Kinnegad, (then Co. Meath), Co WestmeathKinnegad is now in Co. Westmeath. But there have been boundary changes since 1853. and Anne, older daughter of Garrett Robinson of Kilrainy, Co. Kildare. Carew was educated at the Jesuit St Stanislaus' and Clongowes Wood Colleges and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated in 1873. He was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn, London, in July 1874,The Times, 27 November 1885, states July 1874 while the later Times 5 July 1892 mentions 1878. The former seems more likely. and then practised as an equity draftsman and conveyancer. Career He was elected to Parliament for North Kildare in the Irish Parliamentary Party landslide in the 1885 general election by a large majority over the Conservative candidate, and returned unopposed in the election of the following year. He assisted J. J. Clancy in running the Irish Press Agency in London. During the Land War, in February 1889, he was prosecuted for a speech calling for the boycott of the Earl of Drogheda. Following his arrest, in Perthshire, Scotland, while campaigning in support of a Liberal by-election candidate, he was sentenced to four months' imprisonment and confined in Kilkenny, and later Kilmainham Gaols. When the Irish Parliamentary Party split in December 1890 over the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell, Carew supported the latter. He then acted as one of the whips of the Parnellite parliamentary party. In the subsequent bitter general election of 1892, he was defeated by an Anti-Parnellite by 56 to 44 per cent. He contested North Kildare again in 1895 and was defeated by the slightly smaller margin of 53 to 47 percent. The following year the opportunity to return to the House of Commons arose when his fellow Parnellite Dr J. E. Kenny resigned the strongly Parnellite seat of Dublin College Green. Carew was selected and returned unopposed. Later in this parliamentary term, Carew came under attack in the Irish Nationalist movement for attending royal functions. He also became associated with the Healyite faction in the House of Commons. Consequently, in 1900, he was opposed in Dublin College Green by a new Nationalist candidate, Joseph Patrick Nannetti. Although the exact circumstances appear to be disputed, he was additionally nominated for his native seat of South Meath, and elected unopposed because the sitting member John Howard Parnell, expecting no opposition, omitted to submit the fees necessary for nomination in a contested election. Carew subsequently stated in a letter to the press that his return at South Meath was secured without his knowledge or consent, and offered to resign in favour of Parnell or any other candidate nominated by the constituency. However he was defeated at College Green and did not resign South Meath. At the subsequent National Convention of the United Irish League, Carew was excluded from the Irish Parliamentary Party, along with Timothy Healy. Whereas Healy was later reconciled, temporarily, with the IPP, Carew did not live long enough for this to occur. He died suddenly three years later, after having recently been appointed High Sheriff of Kildare. Personal life In 1896, he married Helen (n√©e Wyllie) Kennard (1856‚Äì1928), widow of Hugh Coleridge Kennard of the Grenadier Guards and mother of Sir Coleridge Kennard, 1st Baronet.1901 Census return for 54 Hans Place, Chelsea He died suddenly on 31 August 1903, while on holiday at St Moritz.

Though set in the 12th century, and drawing upon previous versions of the story of this conflict, the play alludes strongly to the 1615 siege of Osaka, in which the forces of the Tokugawa shogunate defeated those of the Toyotomi clan. References to the shogunate, and especially to the campaigns of Tokugawa Ieyasu, were banned from the stage for much of the Edo period (1603-1868) in which the Tokugawa ruled. Yoshitsune Shin-Takadachi, written by Ki no Kaion and first performed in 1719, over a century after the events of the siege of Osaka, is said to have been the first play to successfully allude to these events without being ended by the official censors.Shively, Donald. \\"Tokugawa Plays on Forbidden Topics.\\" in Brandon, James (ed.) _Ch≈´shingura: Studies in Kabuki and the Puppet Theater_. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 1982. p47. Background Like many j≈çruri and kabuki plays, Yoshitsune Shin- Takadachi was not an original narrative, but rather was based on an established series of stories, situations and characters already familiar to the audience, known as a sekai (lit. \\"world\\"). It is one of a great many stories and plays centering on the 12th century samurai commander Minamoto no Yoshitsune, younger brother of Sh≈çgun Minamoto no Yoritomo. A conflict arose between the brothers over suspicions that Yoshitsune, who led the Minamoto clan to victory in the Genpei War and thus allowed Yoritomo to gain power and become sh≈çgun, sought to overthrow his brother. The former was forced to flee Kyoto, and sought refuge in the Takadachi fortress in Hiraizumi, far to the north. He was soon attacked there by his brother's shogunal forces, defeated, and forced to commit seppuku. Allusions are made in the play to the 1615 siege of Osaka, in which Tokugawa Ieyasu led shogunal forces against Toyotomi Hideyori, who had been gathering forces to oppose the shogunate, and who represented the last major opposition to Tokugawa supremacy. Several decades earlier, prior to the end of the 16th century, Ieyasu had been a vassal of Hideyori's father Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and had sworn oaths to serve the Toyotomi and to ensure Hideyori's succession to power. Following Hideyoshi's death in 1598, however, he betrayed his oaths and seized power for himself. The ban on relating these events onstage therefore derived not only from a general aversion to depictions of the honorable, high-class shogunate in the low-class world of the theatres, but also from a fear of the threat posed to the shogunate's power and stability by accusations of Ieyasu's disloyalty and betrayal. Characters Strong allusions are made throughout the play to comparisons between the 12th century figures of the tale and those (absent from the play) who took part in the siege of Osaka. Each character is given here with their 17th century counterpart in parentheses. *Minamoto no Yoritomo (Tokugawa Ieyasu) *Minamoto no Yoshitsune (Toyotomi Hideyori) *Gonnot≈ç Kanefusa (Katagiri Katsumoto) *Izumi no Sabur≈ç (Sanada Yukimura) *Kamei no Rokur≈ç (Kimura Shigenari) *Kataoka no Hachir≈ç (Got≈ç Mototsugu) *Ky≈ç no Kimi/Shizuka Gozen (Yodo-Dono) Summary The plot of the play, while making reference to the actual 12th century historical events, and to a number of other narratives in the Yoshitsune sekai, also parallels in many ways aspects of the historical events of the siege of Osaka. After arriving at Takadachi, Yoshitsune sends three messengers to his brother, to seek reconciliation. These parallel the three envoys sent to Ieyasu from Osaka in 1614. Yoshitsune's envoys explain that he and his followers are guilty of three crimes, and wish to seek forgiveness. The first crime refers to an event in which Yoshitsune and his loyal retainer, the monk Benkei, disguise themselves as monks gathering alms for the rebuilding of the T≈çdai-ji, destroyed in the 1180 siege of Nara, in order to sneak past the guard barrier at Ataka. To prove their identities as monks, the pair are asked to show a subscription list of those who have already donated. Benkei's improvisation of a false list is claimed as the second crime. This event is also depicted in the Noh play Ataka, and the later kabuki play Kanjinch≈ç. Benkei's reading of the blank scroll includes the phrase \\"We request the help of many people to bring virtue to our country's court,\\"Shively. p48. a reference to the army Yoshitsune seeks to raise against his brother, and also in parallel to the forces gathered by Hideyori against the Tokugawa. The inclusion of the characters yori (, \\"request\\") and tomo (, \\"court\\"), that is, the characters of the sh≈çguns name, Yoritomo, in this phrase also alludes to an incident between Hideyori and Ieyasu. Hideyori commissioned the casting of a temple bell for the H≈çk≈ç-ji which included the characters Ie and yasu, split apart, in its inscription in a phrase which was said by the shogunate to have been treasonous. The third crime cited by the messengers is related: that of seeking to gather an army against the shogunate. Yoritomo offers to reconcile with his brother if Yoshitsune fulfills one of three conditions; these conditions closely parallel those offered by Ieyasu to Hideyori. The first is that Yoshitsune (Hideyori) abandon his fortress to become lord of the western provinces. The second is that he submit to the shogunate as the other lords have done. The third is that Yoshitsune send his mistress to the capitol as a hostage. In the original play, this was Ky≈ç no Kimi, though other versions name Shizuka Gozen as the potential hostage; Hideyori was asked to surrender his mother, Lady Yodo. In the end, Yoritomo's shogunal army attacks Yoshitsune's fortress at Takadachi, paralleling the siege of Osaka by diverting the nearby Koromo River to flood the fortifications, and by inclusion of a temporary truce in the middle of the fighting. At Osaka, the Yodo River was diverted, and a significant break occurred in the fighting between winter and summer. Success and spin-offs Kaion's production was successfully performed without incident in 1719. In addition to employing the device known as mitate, of substituting earlier figures and events for later ones, Kaion ensured that the play would be satisfactory to the censors by portraying Yoritomo, who represents Ieyasu, in a positive light. While Yoshitsune is indecisive, and his men disunited, Yoritomo is portrayed as a military genius, dedicated and noble. The play was reworked and reproduced under a number of different titles over the ensuing decades, to varying levels of success. Nanbantetsu Got≈ç Menuki, which changed the sekai of the play from that of Yoshitsune to that of the 14th century Taiheiki (Nanboku-ch≈ç Wars), was written in 1735, but was never allowed to be published or performed. This was due in part to a scene in which an assassination attempt is made upon Ashikaga Takauji, who represents Ieyasu. Yoshitsune Shin-fukumi-j≈ç (Yoshitsune's New Veiled Letter), created in 1744, was based very much on the original, but ended in a reconciliation between the brothers, dropping the siege scenes. Yoshitsune Koshigoe-j≈ç (Yoshitsune's Letter from Koshigoe), was produced ten years later in 1754, and incorporated elements of Nanbantetsu, including the assassination scene of Act IV. This act was forbidden to be performed, and was not seen until 1770; the play was published in its entirely shortly afterwards, implying that it was also performed in its entirely on at least a few occasions.

The pilot, who ejected from the aircraft, survived. A number of passers-by were also injured as they attempted to rescue people trapped in the buildings.Singh, Varinder Singh, 8 die in MiG-21 crash, Tribune News Service, 3 May 2002, accessed 17 April 2007 ( another source for the same article) Overview The aircraft, piloted by Flt Lt SK Nayak, had taken off from Adampur Air Force airbase about 10:00am, five minutes prior to the crash. The pilot reported that he \\"heard some unusual noise followed by an explosion in the engine\\", and ejected. The aircraft crashed into the Bank of Rajasthan (Jalandhar Branch), located in a heavily populated residential and commercial section of the city. The crash started a large fire in the bank and the adjoining lumber store. Pieces of the aircraft also landed on nearby homes. The first fire fighting units to respond could not find water sources with which to fight the blaze, which was not attacked until Indian Army trucks with foam arrived on scene. It took 40 fire units five hours to contain the fire. At least one news source reported that a copilot had also ejected, however the MiG-21bis is a single seat aircraft. Following the crash, the IAF suspended all MiG-21 flight training operations. Safety record The safety record of the IAF's MiG-21s has raised concern in the Indian Parliament and media, leading to the aircraft sometimes being referred to in the IAF as a \\"flying coffin\\". One source estimates that in the nine years from 1993 to 2002, the IAF lost over 100 pilots in 283 accidents. During its service life, the IAF has lost at least 116 aircraft to crashes (not including those lost in combat), with 81 of those occurring since 1990. \\"Prior to discussion on the accident proneness or otherwise of the MiG-21 aircraft, the figures of loss of 221 aircraft and 100 pilots during the period 1991-2000 appear to be incorrect. During this period, 221 MiG-21 were never lost nor 100 pilots lost their lives in MiG-21 accidents. The figures as reported perhaps are the total loss of IAF aircraft involving all the types operated by the service. It is also possible that the figures were wrongly reported in the press.\\"\\"MiG-21: Much Maligned!\\", BHARAT RAKSHAK MONITOR,Wing Cdr. K. S. Suresh VrC (Retd) Volume 5(1) July-August 2002 A detailed response and analysis of the MiG-21's safety record allegations. The age of the MiG-21s, and their safety record, led the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament to call for their immediate phase out in a March, 2002 report, and this crash added urgency to that recommendation. However, Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal S. Krishnaswamy and Air Chief Marshal A.Y. Tipnis have stated that the aircraft are \\"fit to fly\\". Besides the raw age of the aircraft, their maintenance and upkeep have been called into question. Other sources blame the accident rate on failures in the pilot training system. A similar crash occurred on 14 June 1986, when the pilot of a MiG-21 taking off from an air base in Bareilly, India, ejected.

The war was fought mainly in Silesia, Moravia and Bohemia (the lands of the Bohemian Crown) and formed one theatre of the wider War of the Austrian Succession. It was the first of three Silesian Wars fought between Frederick the Great's Prussia and Maria Theresa's Austria in the mid-18th century, all three of which ended in Prussian control of Silesia. No particular triggering event started the war. Prussia cited its centuries-old dynastic claims on parts of Silesia as a casus belli, but Realpolitik and geostrategic factors also played a role in provoking the conflict. Maria Theresa's contested succession to the Habsburg Monarchy provided an opportunity for Prussia to strengthen itself relative to regional rivals such as Saxony and Bavaria. The war began with a Prussian invasion of Habsburg Silesia in late 1740, and it ended in a Prussian victory with the 1742 Treaty of Berlin, which recognised Prussia's seizure of most of Silesia and parts of Bohemia. Meanwhile, the wider War of the Austrian Succession continued, and conflict over Silesia would draw Austria and Prussia into a renewed Second Silesian War only two years later. The First Silesian War marked the unexpected defeat of the Habsburg Monarchy by a lesser German power and initiated the Austria‚ÄìPrussia rivalry that would shape German politics for more than a century. Context and causes In the early 18th century, Brandenburg‚ÄìPrussia's ruling House of Hohenzollern held dynastic claims to various duchies within the Habsburg province of Silesia, a populous and prosperous region contiguous with Prussia's core territory in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Besides its value as a source of tax revenue, industrial output (particularly minerals) and military recruits, Silesia held great geostrategic importance to the belligerents. The valley of the Upper Oder formed a natural military conduit between Brandenburg, the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Margraviate of Moravia, and whichever power held the territory could threaten its neighbours. Silesia also lay along the north-eastern frontier of the Holy Roman Empire, allowing its controller to limit the influence of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and of the Russian Empire within Germany. =Brandenburg‚ÄìPrussia's claims= The Lands of the Bohemian Crown under Habsburg rule until 1742, when most of Silesia was ceded to Brandenburg‚ÄìPrussia Brandenburg‚ÄìPrussia's claims in Silesia were based, in part, on a 1537 inheritance treaty between the Silesian Piast Duke Frederick II of Legnica and the Hohenzollern Prince-Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg, whereby the Silesian Duchies of Liegnitz, Wohlau and Brieg were to pass to the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg should the Piast dynasty in Silesia become extinct. At the time, the Habsburg King FerdinandI of Bohemia (Silesia's feudal overlord) rejected the agreement and pressed the Hohenzollerns to repudiate it. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector JoachimIII Frederick of Brandenburg separately inherited the Silesian Duchy of J√§gerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach, and installed his second son, Johann Georg, as duke. In the 1618 Bohemian Revolt and the ensuing Thirty Years' War, Johann Georg joined the Silesian estates in revolt against the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor FerdinandII. After the Catholic victory in the 1621 Battle of White Mountain, the Emperor confiscated Johann Georg's duchy and refused to return it to his heirs after his death, but the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg continued to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of J√§gerndorf. In 1675 the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to Liegnitz, Wohlau and Brieg when the Silesian Piast line ended with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, but the Habsburg Emperor disregarded the Hohenzollern claims and the lands escheated to the crown. In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor LeopoldI gave Great Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. After the accession of the Great Elector's son and successor, FrederickIII of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, claiming the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Great Elector for life. As a young prince, FrederickIII had secretly agreed to this repossession in return for Leopold's payment of some of his debts, but as monarch he repudiated the agreement and reasserted the old Hohenzollern claims to J√§gerndorf and the Silesian Piast heritage. =Austrian succession= Maria Theresa of Austria , by Martin van Meytens Two generations later, the newly crowned Hohenzollern King Frederick II of Prussia formed designs on Silesia soon after succeeding to the throne in May 1740. Frederick judged that his dynasty's claims were credible, and he had inherited from his father a large and well-trained Prussian army and a healthy royal treasury. Austria was in financial distress, and its army had not been reinforced or reformed after an ignominious performance in the 1737‚Äì1739 Austro-Turkish War. The European strategic situation was favourable for an attack on Austria, with Britain and France occupying each other's attentions in the War of Jenkins' Ear and Sweden moving toward war with Russia; The Electors of Bavaria and Saxony also had claims against Austria and seemed likely to join in the attack. Though the Hohenzollerns' dynastic claims provided a legalistic casus belli, considerations of Realpolitik and geostrategy played the leading role in provoking the war. An opportunity arose for Brandenburg‚ÄìPrussia to press its claims when Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor CharlesVI died in October 1740 without a male heir. With the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, Charles had established his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, as the successor to his hereditary titles. Upon his death she duly became ruler of Austria, as well as of the Bohemian and Hungarian lands within the Habsburg Monarchy. During Emperor Charles's lifetime the Pragmatic Sanction had been generally acknowledged by the imperial states, but when he died it was promptly contested by Prussia, Bavaria and Saxony. Frederick saw in Austria's female succession an opportune moment for the seizure of Silesia, calling it \\"the signal for the complete transformation of the old political system\\" in a 1740 letter to Voltaire. He argued that the Pragmatic Sanction did not apply to Silesia, which was held by the Habsburgs as a part of the imperial demesne rather than as a hereditary possession. Frederick also argued that his father, King Frederick WilliamI, had assented to the Sanction in return for assurances of Austrian support for Hohenzollern claims on the Rhenish Duchies of J√ºlich and Berg, which had not yet materialised. Meanwhile, Prince-Elector Charles Albert of Bavaria and Prince-Elector Frederick AugustusII of Saxony had each married one of Maria Theresa's older cousins from a senior branch of the House of Habsburg, and they used these connections to justify claims to Habsburg territory in the absence of a male heir. Frederick Augustus, who ruled Poland in personal union, was especially interested in gaining control of Silesia to connect his two realms into one contiguous territory (which would nearly surround Brandenburg); Frederick's concern to prevent this outcome contributed to his haste in moving against Austria when the contested succession provided an opportunity. =Moves toward war= Europe in the years after the upright=1.2 As Prussia reactivated its Silesian claims and prepared for war against Austria, several other European powers made similar moves. Charles Albert of Bavaria launched a claim to the imperial throne along with the Habsburg territories of Bohemia, Upper Austria and Tyrol, while Frederick Augustus of Saxony laid claim to Moravia and Upper Silesia. The Kingdoms of Spain and Naples hoped to seize Habsburg possessions in northern Italy, while France, which viewed the Habsburgs as traditional rivals, sought control of the Austrian Netherlands. The Electorates of Cologne and the Palatinate joined these to form an alliance known as the League of Nymphenburg, which aimed at the diminution or destruction of the Habsburg Monarchy and its dominant position among the German states. Austria was supported by Great Britain (in personal union with the Electorate of Hanover) and, eventually, Savoy‚ÄìSardinia and the Dutch Republic; the Russian Empire under Empress Elizabeth also indirectly took Austria's side in the wider conflict by making war against Sweden (a French ally at the time). Maria Theresa's aims in the conflict were, first, to preserve her hereditary lands and titles and, second, to win or compel support for the election of her husband, Duke Francis Stephen of Lorraine, as Holy Roman Emperor, defending her house's traditional preeminence within Germany. After Emperor Charles's death on 20 October, Frederick quickly resolved to strike first; on 8November he ordered the mobilisation of the Prussian army, and on 11 December he issued an ultimatum to Maria Theresa demanding the cession of Silesia. In return, he offered to guarantee all other Habsburg possessions against any attack, pay a large cash indemnity, acknowledge the Pragmatic Sanction, and give his vote as elector of Brandenburg in the imperial election to Maria Theresa's husband. Not waiting for a response, he and his troops advanced into Silesia. =Methods and technologies= European warfare in the early modern period was characterised by the widespread adoption of firearms in combination with more traditional bladed weapons. 18th-century European armies were built around units of massed infantry armed with smoothbore flintlock muskets and bayonets. Cavalrymen were equipped with sabres and pistols or carbines; light cavalry were used principally for reconnaissance, screening and tactical communications, while heavy cavalry were used as tactical reserves and deployed for shock attacks. Smoothbore artillery provided fire support and played the leading role in siege warfare. Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key fortifications positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, with lengthy sieges a common feature of armed conflict. Decisive field battles were relatively rare, though they played a larger part in Frederick's theory of warfare than was typical among his contemporary rivals. The Silesian Wars, like most European wars of the 18th century, were fought as so-called cabinet wars in which disciplined regular armies were equipped and supplied by the state to conduct warfare on behalf of the sovereign's interests. Occupied enemy territories were regularly taxed and extorted for funds, but large-scale atrocities against civilian populations were rare compared with conflicts in the previous century. Military logistics was the decisive factor in many wars, as armies had grown too large to support themselves on prolonged campaigns by foraging and plunder alone. Military supplies were stored in centralised magazines and distributed by baggage trains that were highly vulnerable to enemy raids. Armies were generally unable to sustain combat operations during winter and normally established winter quarters in the cold season, resuming their campaigns with the return of spring. Course =Silesian campaign of 1740‚Äì41= homage of the Silesian estates in 1741, depicted in an 1882 painting by Wilhelm Camphausenupright=1.2 The Prussian army had massed quietly along the Oder during early December 1740, and on 16 December, without a declaration of war, Frederick moved his troops across the frontier into Silesia.Luvaas, from The Prussian force consisted of two corps totalling 27,000 soldiers, while Silesia was defended by an Austrian garrison of only 8,000 men. The Austrians were able to offer only light resistance and garrison a few fortresses; the Prussians swept through the province, taking control of the capital at Breslau without a fight on 2January 1741. The fortress at Ohlau was also taken without resistance on 9January, after which the Prussians used it for their winter quarters. By the end of January 1741, almost the entirety of Silesia had come under Prussian control, and the remaining Austrian strongholds of Glogau, Brieg and Neisse were besieged. After leaving winter quarters in early 1741, the Prussian forces began a spring campaign, and on 9March Prince LeopoldII of Anhalt-Dessau took Glogau by storm. In late March, an Austrian force of around 20,000 under the command of Wilhelm Reinhard von Neipperg crossed the Sudetes mountains from Moravia and broke the siege of Neisse on 5April, after which the main Prussian force manoeuvred to oppose its advance. The two armies engaged each other near the village of Mollwitz on 10 April, where the Prussians under Marshal Kurt von Schwerin successfully stopped the Austrian advance in the Battle of Mollwitz. Neither army acquitted itself well at Mollwitz, and Frederick at one point fled (on Schwerin's advice) to avoid capture, but the Prussians held the field and subsequently portrayed the battle as a victory. Brieg surrendered to the Prussians on 4May, after which the main Prussian force encamped through the succeeding months near Neisse, facing off against Neipperg's Austrians but fighting little. =Negotiations of Mid-1741= crowned Queen of Hungary, St Martin's Cathedral, Pressburgupright=1.2 After Austria's failure at Mollwitz to repel the Prussian invasion, other powers were emboldened to attack the beleaguered archduchy, widening the conflict into what would become the War of the Austrian Succession. France declared its support for Prussia's seizure of Silesia in the 5June Treaty of Breslau, and in July it joined in the Treaty of Nymphenburg, by which France and Spain committed to support Bavaria's territorial claims against Austria. French forces began crossing the Rhine on 15 August, joining the Bavarian forces on the Danube and advancing toward Vienna, while a Spanish‚ÄìNeapolitan army attacked Austria's holdings in northern Italy. Saxony, formerly an Austrian ally, now joined the French alliance, and Britain declared itself neutral to prevent French or Prussian attacks on Hanover. Faced with the prospect of a total partition of her realm, Maria Theresa worked through the following months to regroup and prepare a counter-attack. On 25 June she received her formal coronation as Queen of Hungary in Pressburg and began trying to recruit a new army from her eastern lands. In August she offered Frederick concessions in the Low Countries and a cash payment if Prussia would evacuate Silesia, though she was immediately rebuffed. Meanwhile, fresh enemies attacked Austria on multiple fronts: the Franco-Bavarian force seized Linz on 14 September and advanced through Upper Austria, reaching the vicinity of Vienna by October, while Bohemia was simultaneously invaded by the Saxons. Seeing Austria's distress, Frederick opened secret peace negotiations with Neipperg in Breslau, even as he continued to publicly support the League of Nymphenburg. Although Prussia was allied with the French, the idea of France or Bavaria becoming the dominant power in Germany through Austria's destruction did not appeal to Frederick. With British urging and mediation, on 9October Austria and Prussia agreed to a secret armistice known as the Convention of Klein Schnellendorf, under which both belligerents would cease hostilities in Silesia (though maintaining their appearance), and Austria would eventually concede Lower Silesia in return for a final peace to be negotiated before the end of the year. Neipperg's Austrian forces were then recalled from Silesia to defend Austria against the western invaders, abandoning Neisse after a sham siege in early November and leaving the whole of Silesia under Prussian control. =Bohemia‚ÄìMoravia campaign of 1741‚Äì42= Frederick II of Prussia as crown prince in 1739, by Antoine Pesne In mid-October, Charles Albert of Bavaria and his French allies were encamped near Vienna, ready to besiege it, but he became concerned that Saxony and Prussia would seize parts of Bohemia, which he had also claimed. The French also deprecated a decisive move on Vienna, wishing to see Austria reduced rather than destroyed. So, on 24 October their forces turned north to march instead on Prague. The Bavarian, French and Saxon armies converged in November, besieging it and ultimately storming it on 26 November; Charles Albert went on to proclaim himself King of Bohemia on 7December. Meanwhile, in early November Frederick negotiated the border between putative territories of Prussian Silesia and Saxon Moravia with Frederick Augustus of Saxony, also securing French and Bavarian support for his seizure of the entirety of Silesia, along with the Bohemian County of Glatz. As the Franco-Bavarian allies made territorial gains, Frederick became concerned that Prussia might be sidelined in the eventual peace agreement, so he repudiated the Convention of Klein Schnellendorf, accusing the Austrians of violating its secrecy, and joined the general advance southward into Bohemia and Moravia. In December Schwerin's army advanced through the Sudetes into Moravia, occupying the capital at Olm√ºtz on 27 December, while Prince Leopold's army besieged the fortress at Glatz on the edge of Bohemia. In January 1742 the Imperial election was held at Frankfurt, where Bavarian Elector Charles Albert was chosen as the next Holy Roman Emperor. In early 1742 Frederick organised a joint advance through Moravia toward Vienna with the Saxons and French, which began after their forces met on 5February at Wischau. The French, however, proved reluctant and uncooperative allies, and, after the seizure of Iglau on 15 February, they withdrew into Bohemia. The Prussians and Saxons marched on toward Br√ºnn, the main Austrian stronghold remaining in Moravia, but they made little progress due to the substantial Austrian garrison and a shortage of supplies. The Saxons abandoned the effort on 30 March and returned to Bohemia, where they would remain until withdrawing completely from the war in July. The Moravian campaign achieved no significant gains,Luvaas, from and on 5April the Prussians retreated into Bohemia and Upper Silesia. As the Moravian advance collapsed, Charles Alexander of Lorraine (Maria Theresa's brother-in- law) led a reinforced Austro-Hungarian army of 30,000 through Moravia toward Bohemia, hoping to disperse the Prussians and liberate Prague. In early May, a Prussian army of 28,000 led by Frederick and Prince Leopold marched into the plains of the Elbe south-east of Prague, manoeuvring to block the Austrian advance. The two armies met when Charles's Austrians attacked Prince Leopold's camp near the village of Chotusitz on 17 May; the resulting Battle of Chotusitz ended in a narrow Prussian victory, with substantial casualties on both sides. Prince Charles's defeat at Chotusitz, followed shortly by the defeat of another Austrian army at the Battle of Sahay on 24 May, left Prague securely in the invaders' hands and Austria with no immediate means of driving them out of Bohemia. =Treaties of Breslau and Berlin= upright=1.2 In the aftermath of Chotusitz, Prussia intensified its efforts to reach a separate peace with Austria, and negotiators from the two belligerents met again in Breslau in late May. Frederick now demanded almost the whole of Silesia, as well as the County of Glatz; Maria Theresa was reluctant to make such concessions, but the British envoy, Lord Hyndford, pressed her to make peace with Prussia and concentrate her forces against the French. The British treasury had financed much of Austria's war effort through cash subsidies meant to weaken France, and Hyndford threatened to withdraw Britain's support if Maria Theresa refused to concede Silesia. The two belligerents eventually reached an agreement in the 11 June Treaty of Breslau, which ended the First Silesian War. Under this treaty, Austria conceded to Prussia the large majority of Silesia along with the Bohemian County of Glatz, territories which would later be consolidated to form the Prussian Province of Silesia. Austria retained the remainder of Bohemia and two small portions of the extreme southern end of Silesia, including the Duchy of Teschen and parts of the Duchies of J√§gerndorf, Troppau, and Neisse; these lands would later be combined to form the crown land of Austrian Silesia. Prussia also agreed to take on some of Austria's debts that had been secured against assets in Silesia, as well as committing to remain neutral for the remainder of the ongoing War of the Austrian Succession. This arrangement was formalised and confirmed in the Treaty of Berlin, signed 28 July 1742. Outcomes upright=1.2 The First Silesian War ended in a clear victory for Prussia, which secured some of new territory and around a million new subjects, greatly enhancing its resources and prestige. However, by twice making a separate peace while the War of the Austrian Succession raged on, Frederick abandoned his erstwhile allies in the League of Nymphenburg and earned a reputation for diplomatic unreliability and double-dealing. With Prussia removed from the wider war, Austria launched a major counter-attack and began regaining lost ground on other fronts, and the diplomatic situation shifted in Austria's favour. Prussia's seizure of Silesia also ensured continuing conflict with Austria and Saxony. Maria Theresa's determination to recover Silesia would lead to renewed conflict with Prussia in the Second Silesian War only two years later, with a Third Silesian War to follow after another decade; Saxony would take Austria's side in both future conflicts. =Prussia= In the territorial settlement that ended the war, Prussia gained control of extensive new lands in Glatz and Silesia, a populous and densely industrialised region that would contribute substantial manpower and taxes to the Prussian state. The small kingdom's unexpected victory over the Habsburg Monarchy set it apart from German rivals such as Bavaria and Saxony, marking the beginning of Prussia's rise toward the status of a European great power. The seizure of Silesia made Prussia and Austria into lasting and determined enemies, beginning the Austria‚ÄìPrussia rivalry that would come to dominate German politics over the next century. Saxony, envious of Prussia's ascendancy and threatened by Prussian Silesia's geostrategic position, also turned its foreign policy firmly against Prussia. Frederick's unilateral withdrawal from the Nymphenburg alliance (and its repetition at the end of the Second Silesian War) angered the French court, and his next perceived \\"betrayal\\" (a defensive alliance with Britain under the 1756 Convention of Westminster) accelerated France's eventual realignment toward Austria in the Diplomatic Revolution of the 1750s. =Austria= The Treaties of Breslau and Berlin cost the Habsburg Monarchy its wealthiest province, and capitulating to a lesser German prince significantly dented the Habsburg Monarchy's prestige. The House of Habsburg was also defeated in the Imperial election, calling into question its preeminence within Germany. The Austrian army had found itself outmatched by the more disciplined Prussians, and in late 1741 the Nymphenburg alliance had threatened the Habsburg Monarchy with disaster. However, peace in the Silesian theatre gave the Austrian forces a free hand to reverse the gains made by the French and Bavarians the previous year. The western invaders were driven back up the Danube Valley in early 1742, and Saxony withdrew its forces from Bohemia after the Treaty of Berlin, making peace with Austria near the end of the year. The Franco-Bavarian forces occupying Prague were isolated and besieged, eventually giving up the city in December. By mid-1743, Austria would recover control of Bohemia, drive the French back across the Rhine into Alsace, and occupy Bavaria, exiling Emperor Charles Albert to Frankfurt.

Cass, V. (1979). Homosexual identity formation: A theoretical model. Journal of Homosexuality, 4 (3), 219-235. This model was one of the first to treat gay people as normal in a heterosexist society and in a climate of homophobia instead of treating homosexuality itself as a problem. Cass described a process of six stages of gay and lesbian identity development. While these stages are sequential, some people might revisit stages at different points in their lives.  The six stages of Cass' model  = Identity confusion = In the first stage, identity confusion, the person is amazed to think of themselves as a gay person. \\"Could I be gay?\\" This stage begins with the person's first awareness of gay or lesbian thoughts, feelings, and attractions. The people typically feel confused and experience turmoil. To the question \\"Who am I?\\", the answers can be acceptance, psychological self-denial and repression, or rejection. Possible responses can be: to avoid information about lesbians and gays; inhibited behavior; self-denial of homosexuality (\\"experimenting\\", \\"an accident\\", \\"just drunk\\", \\"just looking\\"). Men often keep emotional involvement separated from sexual contact; women often have deep, strongly emotional but non-sexual relationships. The possible needs can be: the person may explore internal positive and negative judgments. Will be allowed to be uncertain regarding sexual identity. May find support in knowing that sexual behavior occurs along a spectrum. May receive permission and encouragement to explore sexual identity as a normal experience (like career identity and social identity). = Identity comparison = The second stage is called identity comparison. In this stage, the person accepts the possibility of being gay or lesbian and examines the wider implications of that tentative commitment. \\"Maybe this does apply to me.\\" The self-alienation becomes isolation. The task is to deal with the social alienation. Possible responses can be: the person may begin to grieve for losses and the things they give up by embracing their sexual orientation (marriage, children). They may compartmentalize their own sexuality--accept lesbian/gay definition of behavior but maintain \\"heterosexual\\" identity. Tells oneself, \\"It's only temporary\\"; \\"I'm just in love with this particular woman/man\\"; etc. The possible needs can be: will be very important that the person develops own definitions. Will need information about sexual identity, lesbian, gay community resources, encouragement to talk about loss of heterosexual life expectations. May be permitted to keep some \\"heterosexual\\" identity (as \\"not an all or none\\" issue). = Identity tolerance = In the third stage, identity tolerance, the person comes to the understanding they are \\"not the only one\\". The person acknowledges they are likely gay or lesbian and seeks out other gay and lesbian people to combat feelings of isolation. Increased commitment to being lesbian or gay. The task is to decrease social alienation by seeking out lesbians and gays. Possible responses can be: beginning to have language to talk and think about the issue. Recognition that being lesbian or gay does not preclude other options. Accentuate difference between self and heterosexuals. Seek out lesbian and gay culture (positive contact leads to more positive sense of self, negative contact leads to devaluation of the culture, stops growth). The person may try out variety of stereotypical roles. The possible needs can be: to be supported in exploring own shame feelings derived from heterosexism, as well as internalized homophobia. Receive support in finding positive lesbian, gay community connections. It is particularly important for the person to know community resources. There are many ways you can get support. Examples include LGBQT clubs, organizations for the gay community. = Identity acceptance = The identity acceptance stage means the person accepts themselves. \\"I will be okay.\\" The person attaches a positive connotation to their gay or lesbian identity and accepts rather than tolerates it. There is continuing and increased contact with the gay and lesbian culture. The task is to deal with inner tension of no longer subscribing to society's norm, attempt to bring congruence between private and public view of self. Possible responses can be: accepts gay or lesbian self-identification. May compartmentalize \\"gay life\\". Maintain less and less contact with heterosexual community. Attempt to \\"fit in\\" and \\"not make waves\\" within the gay and lesbian community. Begin some selective disclosures of sexual identity. More social coming out; more comfortable being seen with groups of men or women that are identified as \\"gay\\". More realistic evaluation of situation. The possible needs can be: continue exploring grief and loss of heterosexual life expectation, continue exploring internalized homophobia (learned shame from heterosexist society). Find support in making decisions about where, when, and to whom to disclose. = Identity pride = In the identity pride stage, sometimes the coming out of the closet arrives, and the main thinking is \\"I've got to let people know who I am!\\" The person divides the world into heterosexuals and homosexuals, and is immersed in gay and lesbian culture while minimizing contact with heterosexuals. Us-them quality to political/social viewpoint. The task is to deal with the incongruent views of heterosexuals. Possible responses include: splits world into \\"gay\\" (good) and \\"straight\\" (bad)--experiences disclosure crises with heterosexuals as they are less willing to \\"blend in\\"--identify gay culture as sole source of support, acquiring all gay friends, business connections, social connections. The possible needs can be: to receive support for exploring anger issues, to find support for exploring issues of heterosexism, to develop skills for coping with reactions and responses to disclosure to sexual identity, and to resist being defensive. = Identity synthesis = The last stage in Cass' model is identity synthesis: the person integrates their sexual identity with all other aspects of self, and sexual orientation becomes only one aspect of self rather than the entire identity. The task is to integrate gay and lesbian identity so that instead of being the identity, it is an aspect of self. Possible responses can be: continues to be angry at heterosexism, but with decreased intensity, or allows trust of others to increase and build. Gay and lesbian identity is integrated with all aspects of \\"self\\". The person feels \\"all right\\" to move out into the community and not simply define space according to sexual orientation. This is a normal feeling.  Criticisms of the model  Joanne Kaufman and Cathryn Johnson have argued that based upon more recent research, this model is less valid today than it was at its inception for several reasons:Kaufman, Joanne and Johnson, Cathryn (2004) Stigmatized Individuals and the Process of Identity, The Sociological Quarterly, 45 (4), 807‚Äì33 #This model does not take into account socio- cultural factors that can impact identity development. #The nature of the social stigma and its management practices have changed since the inception of the model. #The linear nature of the model would suggest that anyone who abandons the model or fails to go through each of the six stages would not be able to be considered as a well adjusted homosexual, which may no longer be true.

The case centred upon the liability of the police for the nervous shock suffered in consequence of the events of the Hillsborough disaster. Facts Alcock concerned psychiatric harm caused by the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. This occurred at the Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield during the FA Cup Semi-Final in which 96 spectators were killed and 450 injured in a human crush. The disaster was broadcast live on television and radio. Despite considerable public controversy, South Yorkshire Police had admitted liability in negligence for the deaths, having allowed too many supporters into the stadium. In the Alcock case, 10 relatives of the deceased brought negligence claims in tort for psychiatric harm or nervous shock. Of the claimants, most had not been present in the stadium at the time of the disaster and none had been in physical risk. Most had sustained psychiatric injuries after learning of the events by television or radio. Judgment The plaintiffs in this case were mostly secondary victims, i.e. they were not \\"directly affected\\" as opposed to the primary victims who were either injured or were in danger of immediate injury. The Judicial Committee of the House of Lords, consisting of Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Ackner, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle, and Lord Lowry has established a number of \\"control mechanisms\\" or conditions that had to be fulfilled in order for a duty of care to be found in such cases. *The claimant who is a \\"secondary victim\\" must perceive a \\"shocking event\\" with his own unaided senses, as an eye-witness to the event, or hearing the event in person, or viewing its \\"immediate aftermath\\". This requires close physical proximity to the event, and would usually exclude events witnessed by television or informed of by a third party, as was the case with some of the plaintiffs in Alcock. *The shock must be a \\"sudden\\" and not a \\"gradual\\" assault on the claimant's nervous system. So a claimant who develops a depression from living with a relative debilitated by the accident will not be able to recover damages. *If the nervous shock is caused by witnessing the death or injury of another person the claimant must show a \\"sufficiently proximate\\" relationship to that person, usually described as a \\"close tie of love and affection\\". Such ties are presumed to exist only between parents and children, as well as spouses and fianc√©s. In other relations, including siblings, ties of love and affection must be proved. * It must be reasonably foreseeable that a person of \\"normal fortitude\\" in the claimant‚Äôs position would suffer psychiatric damage. The closer the tie between the claimant and the victim, the more likely it is that he would succeed in this element. However, once it is shown that some psychiatric damage was foreseeable, it does not matter that the claimant was particularly susceptible to psychiatric illness - the defendant must \\"take his victim as he finds him\\" and pay for all the consequences of nervous shock (see \\"Eggshell skull\\" rule). Significance The impact of this on the area of law once described as a '\\"patchwork quilt of distinctions which are quite difficult to justify\\"See Lord Steyn in Frost v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [1999] 2 AC 455 is significant because the decision made by the Law Lords was heavily influenced by the greater social concern of allowing a flood of claims with which the judicial system would not be able to cope (the \\"floodgates argument\\"). The decision has been criticised as being excessively harsh on the claimants, as well as not fully corresponding with medical knowledge regarding psychiatric illness brought about by nervous shock.See the Law Commission Report Liability for Psychiatric Illness , Part III Although reform has been widely advocated and a legislative proposal to mitigate some of the effects of Alcock was drafted by the Parliamentary Law Commission in 1998, the decision in Alcock represents the state of the law in the area of liability for psychiatric harm as it currently stands.

A 1983 graduate out of Manhattan High School, Colbert was selected in the 20th round of the 1986 Major League Baseball draft by the San Francisco Giants. He played in their farm system until making his debut at the beginning of the season, and played in 72 games over two seasons, being released after the season. Colbert played several more seasons in the minor leagues, first for the Cleveland Indians, then for the San Diego Padres. In , Colbert became a player-coach for the Las Vegas Stars, ending his playing career after that season. From through , Colbert worked his way up the Padres' chain, managing at four different levels of the minor leagues. In , he was named the Padres' bench coach, a position from which he was let go on September 29, following a 99 loss season. It seems that he and hitting coach Wally Joyner were the scapegoats for the disappointing season. Though upper management's inability to put proven talent on the field, the team's bottom ranking in MLB at scoring runs, next to last ranking in team batting average, injuries to Jake Peavy and Chris Young, and their paltry 36 stolen bases for the whole season (a total that 11 players in the AL and NL surpassed on their own) heavily contributed to their lackluster season. He is currently a scout for the Philadelphia Phillies.

The style of the strip is an homage to George Herriman's Krazy Kat. The character is not related to the 1975 film Down and Dirty Duck. While promoted under the abbreviated title Dirty Duck, the film has no connection to London's character or comics. Publication history London originally created the Dirty Duck character in 1970 to appear in an unsigned \\"basement\\" strip that would run underneath Dan O'Neill's syndicated Odd Bodkins strip. The cartoon strips planned to run underneath O'Neill's \\"Odd Bodkins\\" never saw print. The first person who succeeded in helping the strip see print was Gilbert Shelton, who ran it under Fat Freddy's Cat in the Los Angeles Free Press in early spring of 1971. The character's first long-form appearance was in Air Pirates Funnies #1 (Last Gasp, July 1971). John Bagley's San Francisco- based Company & Sons published The Dirty Duck Book #1 in December 1971. Shortly afterwards, London was contacted by the publishers of National Lampoon, where Dirty Duck ran monthly for several years alongside the work of London's wife Shary Flenniken, who was drawing Trots and Bonnie for them. London moved the strip to Playboy magazine around 1976, where it ran until 1987. Dirty Duck later returned to Playboy and continues to run there as of 2011. Almost all of the strips would have been collected in a hardcover collection from IDW Publishing under the Top Shelf imprint, but it has continuously been delayed since 2017. It is expected to arrive in 2021. Characters The main characters are two anthropomorphic animals, a cigar- smoking duck (usually referred to as \\"Mr. Duck\\") and his assistant, Weevil. They live in human society and are often seen in the company of naked human women. In the comic strip running in Playboy, Mr. Duck is a wealthy and elderly gentleman with a lecherous streak and a sharp (if sardonic) wit. Weevil is his long-suffering butler.

Life Hawkins is notable for two translations he made while quite young. He later had a long career among the English speaking Jesuits in exile. His father was the grammarian and physician John Hawkins; Sir Thomas Hawkins and the Jesuit leader Henry Hawkins were his uncles. As a young man and adult, Hawkins lived at Anglophone centers of Jesuit learning and service in Europe: he went between the Jesuit College at Watten, the English college at Li√®ge, and the college of Saint Omer. He took his vows in 1662, and then served in multiple college positions. Hawkins finally settled at Li√®ge in 1675. He died of unknown causes in 1681. Works At the age of ten, Hawkins published An Alarum for Ladyes, translated from Jean Puget de la Serre, and dedicated to Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset. At 13, he published Youths Behaviour, or, Decency in Conversation amongst Men (1641). It was a translation from a French conduct book. It is possible that the latter work was translated earlier, and only published in 1641: there are internal references to its being the first translation by Hawkins. Youths Behaviour was popular and ran to ten editions by 1672. Robert Codrington wrote Youths Behaviour, or, Decency in Conversation amongst Women in 1664.

It consisted of this: at the termination of a public functionary's term, his performance in office was subject to review, and those with grievances against him were entitled to a hearing. This was largely an automatic procedure, and did not imply prior suspicion of misconduct. The official was not allowed to leave the place where he exercised his authority, nor to assume another office, until the conclusion of this judicial inquiry. Generally, the person charged with directing the inquiry, called the juez de residencia (residence judge), was that individual already named to succeed to the position. The penalties for conviction varied, but generally consisted of fines. The juicio de residencia took on great importance in the administration of the Indies, perhaps because of the great distances involved and the difficulty of direct supervision by the Crown. It extended from the viceroys and the presidents of the Audiencia to the alcaldes and the alguaciles (judicial officials, sometimes translated as sheriffs). With the entrance into force of the Spanish Constitution of 1812, the procedure no longer applied. Originally, every viceroy had to pass his juicio de residencia before his successor could take office. But in the eighteenth century viceregal juicios were conducted after the outgoing viceroy had returned to Spain. During the lengthy process (up to six months), the degree of the viceroy's compliance with his instructions was analyzed, his job performance was reviewed, and many testimonies were collected from different parties. Another formula the Crown used to control its officials, including the viceroy in his capacity as president of the Audiencia, was the visitador who collected visitas. The visitador was an inspector named at the pleasure of the king to investigate a particular administration. Like the juicio, this institution had the aim of discovering abuses committed by the authorities, and proposing necessary reforms. External links * Marina, Bel√©n (2006).

He went on to earn a theological degree from the German Lutheran Church. He studied with theologians Rudolf Otto and Paul Tillich, the philosopher Martin Heidegger, and the psychologist Carl Jung. He participated in Jung's Eranos symposia and lectured at Jung's institute in Zurich. In 1933, Spiegelberg took over Tillich's position at the University of Dresden, but only four years later he was fired from his position and he and his wife, Rosalie, fled Hitler¬πs Germany with the aid of Tillich.\\"Comparative Religions Expert Frederic Spiegelberg Dies at 97\\" In the United States, Spiegelberg taught at Columbia University, the University of Rochester, the University of California, Union Theological Seminary and the Pacific School of Religion. He joined Stanford as a lecturer in religion in 1941 and retired in 1962 as professor of Indian civilization in the Department of Asiatic and Slavic Studies. He became an expert in Asian religions with a classical comparative focus. He was known for his command of languages, including Sanskrit, Pali, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, German and French. He was considered an exceptional lecturer, winning student awards and the admiration of peers. In 1950, Spiegelberg invited Indian professor of philosophy Haridas Chaudhuri, who had done his dissertation on the Integral philosophy of Sri Aurobindo, to join the staff of the newly formed American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco, the first accredited U.S. graduate school devoted exclusively to the study of Asiatic lands and peoples. This school was closed and replaced in 1968 by the California Institute of Asian (now Integral) Studies founded by Haridas Chaudhuri where Spiegelberg served as president from 1976 to 1978. In 1960, Spiegelberg and Chaudhuri published a commemorative volume on Sri Aurobindo.Chaudhuri, Haridas, and Frederic Spiegelberg, eds. The Integral Philosophy of Sri Aurobindo: A Commemorative Symposium. Allen & Unwin, 1960. Spiegelberg was also involved in founding the Esalen Institute with former student Michael Murphy and Dick Price. In 2007, religion scholar Jeffrey Kripal summarized Spiegelberg's approach to religion as follows: :Spiegelberg‚Äôs phrase \\"the religion of no religion\\" had deep existential roots. It was based on a mystical encounter with the natural world he experienced as a young theology student. He was walking in a wheat field on a bright day when, quite suddenly, his ego vanished and what he calls the Self appeared. Through this altered perspective, he began to see that God was shining through everything in the world, that everything was divine, that there was nothing but holiness. As he reveled in this revelation, he came around a corner and found himself confronting a gray church. He was horrified. How, he asked himself, could such a building claim to hold something more sacred, more divine, than what he had just experienced in the poppies, birds, and sky of the now divinized cosmos? It all seemed preposterous, utterly preposterous, to him. From the theological scandal of this initial altered state, Spiegelberg developed and theorized what was essentially (or non- essentially) an apophatic mystical theology that approaches religious language, symbol, and myth as non-literal projective expressions of some deeper metaphysical truth that, paradoxically, is simultaneously immanent and transcendent‚Äîa kind of dialectical or mystical humanism, if you will. It was just such a comparative mystical theology grounded in the natural world, and just such a critical but deep engagement with the religious traditions of the world, that inspired Murphy and his colleagues in their new venture.Kripal, Jeffrey.

He is noted for his buildings designed for George Hudson's railways, especially the York and North Midland Railway. Andrews' architect's practice in York did not confine itself to railway work, its other buildings including headquarters for two York-based banks and a number of churches. Life Andrews' roots lay in Jamaica and in London, but from the 1820s he was mainly in York. He was assistant to Peter Frederick Robinson. He won a Society of Arts premium in 1824. He was a council member of the Yorkshire Architectural Society, and Sheriff of York in 1846-47, during George Hudson's third term as mayor. In 1836 he was appointed a Fellow of the Institute of British Architects in London. He died in York on 29 December 1855. Railway work Andrews designed all the buildings, not only the stations, for the York and North Midland Railway (Y&NM;) from the middle of 1839 until the work dried up in 1849 following the downfall of George Hudson. Having designed the new York station jointly for the Y&NM; and the Great North of England Railway (GNER), he went on to design buildings for the GNER as far north as Northallerton. He designed all the buildings for the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway and the Yorkshire buildings of the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway. The Y&NM; opened its first section from a temporary station outside the walls of York in May 1839 but Hudson wanted to bring the railway into the heart of York, which meant breaching the city walls. Andrews provided the favoured design for the requisite entry in the form of a Tudor arch. The new station was laid out to a plan by Robert Stephenson, which was a development of his plan for Euston station making allowances for York's status as a junction. Andrews designed the station buildings. They comprised two separate trainsheds, joined at each end, producing a hipped appearance, which became one of Andrew's trademarks. Each shed was (like Euston) of 40 ft span and the roof was supported by wrought iron \\"Euston trusses\\", giving a more slender airy construction than contemporary wooden station roofs. The train sheds were clad with slate on wooden planking, with the portion nearest the apex being glazed. The main station facilities were ranged along the departure platform with a central booking office flanked by the waiting rooms for each class (and a separate waiting room for ladies); provision was also made for parcels traffic, left luggage, the station master and the maintenance of lamps. On the first floor was the Y&NM; boardroom and offices. Adjacent to the arrivals platform were 1st and 2nd class refreshment rooms and a bar with bedrooms above. Due to delays in agreeing the building design with the GNER the station was incomplete when services started running to London. It finally opened on 4 January 1841. The station at York embodied many of the features Andrews was to use in his other medium and large stations for the Y&NM;, in particular the hipped roof supported by \\"Euston trusses\\" but in later examples, the glazed portion of the roof was raised and given louvered sides to let smoke and steam out. Locomotives were not originally expected to enter York station but later that roof too was modified.

Regrading is the process of grading for raising and/or lowering the levels of land. Such a project can also be referred to as a regrade.

Regrading is typically performed to make land more level (flatter), in which case it is sometimes called levelling.\\"Montana, McLaren Tailings\\", p.35 in CERCLA Imminent Hazard Mining and Mineral Processing Facilities, Office of Solid Waste, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, February 1997. Accessed online 16 October 2007.) Levelling can have the consequence of making other nearby slopes steeper, and potentially unstable or prone to erosion. Transportation In the case of gravel roads and earthworks for certain purposes, grading forms not just the base but the cover and surface of the finished construction, and is often called finished grade. Process Modern road grader It is often done using heavy machinery like bulldozers and excavators to roughly prepare an area and then using a grader for a finer finish. Environmental design In the environmental design professions grading and regrading are a specifications and construction component in landscape design, landscape architecture, and architecture projects. It is used for buildings or outdoor amenities regarding foundations and footings, slope terracing and stabilizing, aesthetic contouring, and directing surface runoff drainage of stormwater and domestic/irrigation runoff flows. Purposes Reasons for regrading include: * Enabling construction on lands that were previously too varied and/or steeply sloped. * Enabling transportation along routes that were previously too varied and/or steep. * Changing drainage patterns and rerouting surface flow. * Improving the stability of terrain adjacent to developments.Malcolm Puller, Deep Excavations: A Practical Manual, Thomas Telford (1996). . p. 63. Consequences Potential problems and consequences from regrading include: * Soil and/or slope instability * Terrain prone to erosion * Ecological impacts, habitat destruction, terrestrial and/or aquatic biological losses. * Drainage problems (surface and/or subsurface flow) for areas not considered in the regrading plan.Barry Stone, Adjacent Property Regrading Creates Drainage Problem for Homeowner, doityourself.com.

Queer Pulp: Perverted Passions from the Golden Age of the Paperback (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 2001), page 6. It is written in the Southern Gothic style and is notable for its atmosphere of isolation and decadence.Rudisill, Marie & Simmons, James C. The Southern Haunting of Truman Capote (Nashville, Tennessee: Cumberland House, 2000), page 116. Other Voices, Other Rooms is significant because it is both Capote's first published novel and semi-autobiographical. It is also noteworthy due to its erotically charged photograph of the author, risqu√© content, and debut at number nine on The New York Times Best Seller list,Davis, Deborah. Party of the Century: The Fabulous Story of Truman Capote and his Black and White Ball (Hoboken: John Wiley and Sons, 2006), pages 22 & 29. where it remained for nine weeks.Rudisill, Marie & Simmons, James C. The Southern Haunting of Truman Capote (Nashville, Tennessee: Cumberland House, 2000), page 113. Conception Truman Capote began writing the manuscript for Other Voices, Other Rooms after being inspired by a walk in the woods while he was living in Monroeville, Alabama. He immediately cast aside his rough manuscript for Summer Crossing and took up writing Other Voices, Other Rooms. After leaving Alabama, he continued to work on the manuscript in New Orleans, Louisiana. His budding literary fame put him in touch with fellow southerner and writer Carson McCullers. Capote joined McCullers at the artists' community, Yaddo, in Saratoga Springs, New York, to continue working on his novel. As friends, McCullers helped Capote locate an agent and a publisher (Marion Ives and Random House) for Other Voices, Other Rooms. Capote continued to work on the novel in North Carolina and eventually completed it in a rented cottage in Nantucket, Massachusetts.Davis, Deborah. Party of the Century: The Fabulous Story of Truman Capote and his Black and White Ball (Hoboken: John Wiley and Sons, 2006), page 25. Truman Capote took two years to write Other Voices, Other Rooms.Capote, Truman, The Dogs Bark: Public People and Private Places (New York: Random House, 1973), pages 3 & 10. Plot After his mother's death, 13-year-old Joel Harrison Knox, a lonely, effeminate boy, is sent from New Orleans, Louisiana, to live with his father, who abandoned him at the time of his birth. Arriving at Skully's Landing, a vast, decaying mansion on an isolated plantation in Mississippi, Joel meets his sullen stepmother Amy, Amy's cousin Randolph, a gay man and dandy, the defiant tomboy Idabel, a girl who becomes his friend, and Jesus and Zoo, the two black caretakers of the home. He also sees a spectral \\"queer lady\\" with \\"fat dribbling curls\\" watching him from a top window. Despite Joel's queries, the whereabouts of his father remain a mystery. When he finally is allowed to see his father, Joel is stunned to find he is a mute quadriplegic, having tumbled down a flight of stairs after being inadvertently shot by Randolph and nearly dying. Joel runs away with Idabel to a carnival and meets a woman with dwarfism; on a Ferris wheel, the woman attempts to touch Joel in a sexual manner and is rebuffed. Looking for Idabel in a storm, Joel catches pneumonia and eventually returns to the Landing, where he is nursed back to health by Randolph. The implication in the final paragraph is that the \\"queer lady\\" beckoning from the window is actually Randolph, dressed in an old Mardi Gras costume. Characters Joel Harrison Knox: The 13-year-old protagonist of the story. Joel is a portrait of Truman Capote in his own youth, notably being delicate, fair-skinned and able to tell outrageous tales without hesitation.Rudisill, Marie & Simmons, James C. The Southern Haunting of Truman Capote (Nashville, Tennessee: Cumberland House, 2000), page 115. Mr. Edward R. Sansom: Joel's paralyzed father, a former boxing manager. Miss Amy Skully: Joel's sharp-tongued stepmother who is in her late forties and shorter than Joel. Miss Amy's character is reminiscent of Callie Faulk, an older cousin with whom Truman Capote lived in Alabama.Berendt, John. \\"Introduction\\" in Truman Capote, Other Voices, Other Rooms (2004/1948) Random House. p. xiv. She is also reminiscent of Capote's maternal grandmother, Mabel Knox, who always wore a glove on her left hand to cover an unknown malady and was known for her Southern aristocratic ways.Rudisill, Marie & Simmons, James C. The Southern Haunting of Truman Capote (Nashville, Tennessee: Cumberland House, 2000), page 126. Randolph: Miss Amy's first cousin and owner of Skully's Landing. Randolph is in his mid-30s and is effeminate, narcissistic, and openly homosexual. Randolph's character is largely imaginary, but is a faint shadow of Capote's older cousin Bud Faulk, a single man, likely homosexual, and role model for Capote while he was growing up in Alabama.Rudisill, Marie & Simmons, James C. The Southern Haunting of Truman Capote (Nashville, Tennessee: Cumberland House, 2000), page 128‚Äì129. Idabel Thompkins: A gloomy, cantankerous tomboy who befriends Joel. Idabel's character is an exaggeration of Capote's childhood friend, Nelle Harper Lee, later the author of To Kill a Mockingbird. Florabel Thompkins: Idabel's feminine and prissy sister. Jesus Fever: A centenarian, pygmyish, African American mule-driver at Skully's Landing, where he had been a slave 70 years before. Missouri Fever (Zoo): Jesus' granddaughter who is in her mid-20s. She wears a scarf on her elongated neck to hide a large scar inflicted by Keg Brown, who was sentenced to a chain gang for his crime. Missouri Fever's character is based on a cook named Little Bit who lived and worked in the Alabama home where Capote lived, as a child, with his older cousins.Rudisill, Marie & Simmons, James C. The Southern Haunting of Truman Capote (Nashville, Tennessee: Cumberland House, 2000), page 120. Pepe Alvarez: A Latin professional boxer who is Randolph's original obsession and muse, and the prototype that led to Randolph's obsession with young Joel, as it is inferred that Joel resembles Pepe. Ellen Kendall: Joel's kind, genteel aunt who sends him from New Orleans to live with his father. Little Sunshine: A short, bald, ugly, African American hermit who lives at The Cloud Hotel. Miss Wisteria: A blond midget who befriends Joel and Idabel at a fair traveling through Noon City. Major themes On more than one occasion Capote himself asserts that the central theme of Other Voices, Other Rooms is a son's search for his father. In Capote's own words, his father, Arch Persons, was, \\"a father who, in the deepest sense, was nonexistent.\\"Plimpton, George. Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances, and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career (New York: Doubleday, 1997), page 80-81. Again, in his own words, Capote writes \\"the central theme of Other Voices, Other Rooms was my search for the existence of this essentially imaginary person.\\"Capote, Truman, The Dogs Bark: Public People and Private Places (New York: Random House, 1973), page 8. Another theme is self-acceptance as part of coming of age. Deborah Davis points out that Joel's thorny and psychological voyage while living with eccentric Southern relatives involves maturing \\"from an uncertain boy into a young man with a strong sense of self and acceptance of his homosexuality.\\"Davis, Deborah. Party of the Century: The Fabulous Story of Truman Capote and his Black and White Ball (Hoboken: John Wiley and Sons, 2006), page 22. Gerald Clarke describes the conclusion of the novel, \\"Finally, when he goes to join the queer lady in the window, Joel accepts his destiny, which is to be homosexual, to always hear other voices and live in other rooms. Yet acceptance is not a surrender; it is a liberation. \\"I am me,\\" he whoops. \\"I am Joel, we are the same people.\\" So, in a sense, had Truman rejoiced when he made peace with his own identity.\\"Clarke, Gerald. Capote: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988), pages 152-153. In addition to the two specific themes above, John Berendt notes in his introduction to the 2004 Modern Library edition, several broad themes including the terror of abandonment, the misery of loneliness and the yearning to be loved.Berendt, John. \\"Introduction\\" in Truman Capote, Other Voices, Other Rooms (2004/1948) Random House. p. xvi. Another theme is understanding others. John Knowles says, \\"The theme in all of his [Truman Capote's] books is that there are special, strange gifted people in the world and they have to be treated with understanding.\\"Plimpton, George. Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances, and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career (New York: Doubleday, 1997), page 175. Gerald Clarke points out that within the story Randolph is the spokesperson for the novel's major themes. Clarke asserts that the four major themes of Other Voices, Other Rooms are \\"the loneliness that afflicts all but the stupid or insensitive; the sacredness of love, whatever its form; the disappointment that invariably follows high expectations; and the perversion of innocence.\\"Clarke, Gerald. Capote: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988), page 151. Publication history Other Voices, Other Rooms was published in 1979 as part of the 60 Signed Limited Editions (1977‚Äì1982) series by the Franklin Library, described as a \\"distributor of great 'classic title' books produced in fine bindings for collectors\\". It was published by Random House in January 1948. Reception and critical analysis The novel's reception began before the novel hit bookshelves. Prior to its even being published, 20th Century Fox optioned movie rights to the novel without having seen the work.Capote, Truman, The Dogs Bark: Public People and Private Places (New York: Random House, 1973), page 6. Additionally, Life magazine conferred Capote equal space alongside other writers such as Gore Vidal and Jean Stafford in an article about young American writers, even though he had never published a novel.Capote, Truman, The Dogs Bark: Public People and Private Places (New York: Random House, 1973), page 7. Literary critics of the day were eager to review Capote's novel and express their opinions. Mostly positive reviews came from a variety of publications including The New York Herald Tribune, but The New York Times published a dismissive review. Diana Trilling wrote in The Nation about Capote's \\"striking literary virtuosity\\" and praised \\"his ability to bend language to his poetic moods, his ear for dialect and varied rhythms of speech.\\"Plimpton, George. Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances, and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career (New York: Doubleday, 1997), page 78. Capote was compared to William Faulkner, Eudora Welty, Carson McCullers, Katherine Anne Porter, and even Oscar Wilde and Edgar Allan Poe. Authors, as well as critics, weighed in; Somerset Maugham remarked that Capote was \\"the hope of modern literature.\\"Davis, Deborah. Party of the Century: The Fabulous Story of Truman Capote and his Black and White Ball (Hoboken: John Wiley and Sons, 2006), page 29. After Capote pressured the editor George Davis for his assessment of the novel, he quipped, \\"I suppose someone had to write the fairy Huckleberry Finn.\\" Clarke, Gerald. Capote: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988), page 158. Some twenty-five years later, Ian Young points out that Other Voices, Other Rooms notably avoided the period convention of an obligatory tragedy, typically involving suicide, murder, madness, despair or accidental death for the gay protagonist.Young, Ian, The Male Homosexual in Literature: A Bibliography, Metuchen, NJ: The Scarecrow Press, 1975, page 154 Other Voices, Other Rooms is ranked number 26 on a list of the top 100 gay and lesbian novels compiled by The Publishing Triangle in 1999.The Publishing Triangle's list of the 100 best lesbian and gay novels More than fifty years after its publication, Anthony Slide notes that Other Voices, Other Rooms is one of only four familiar gay novels of the first half of the 20th century. The other three novels are Djuna Barnes' Nightwood, Carson McCullers' Reflections in a Golden Eye, and Gore Vidal's The City and the Pillar.Slide, Anthony. Lost Gay Novels: A Reference Guide to Fifty Works from the First Half of the Twentieth Century, (Binghamton, NY: Harrington Park Press, 2003), page 2. When Other Voices, Other Rooms was published in 1948, it stayed on The New York Times Bestseller list for nine weeks, selling more than 26,000 copies.Clarke, Gerald. Capote: A Biography (New York: Carroll & Graf, 2005), page 158. The promotion and controversy surrounding this novel catapulted Capote to fame. A 1947 Harold Halma photograph, used to promote the book, showed the then-23-year-old Capote reclining and gazing into the camera.Bronski, Michael, ed. Pulp Friction: Uncovering the Golden Age of Gay Male Pulps (New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 2003), pages 342-343. Gerald Clarke, a modern biographer, observed, \\"The famous photograph: Harold Halma's picture on the dustjacket of Other Voices, Other Rooms caused as much comment and controversy as the prose inside. Truman claimed that the camera had caught him off guard, but in fact he had posed himself and was responsible for both the picture and the publicity.\\"Clarke, Gerald. Capote: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1988). Much of the early attention to Capote centered around different interpretations of this photograph, which was viewed as a suggestive pose by some. According to Clarke, the photo created an \\"uproar\\" and gave Capote \\"not only the literary, but also the public personality he had always wanted.\\" In an article titled A Voice from a Cloud in the November 1967 edition of Harper's Magazine, Capote acknowledged the autobiographical nature of Other Voices, Other Rooms. He wrote \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms was an attempt to exorcise demons, an unconscious, altogether intuitive attempt, for I was not aware, except for a few incidents and descriptions, of its being in any serious degree autobiographical. Rereading it now, I find such self- deception unpardonable.\\"Capote, Truman, The Dogs Bark: Public People and Private Places (New York: Random House, 1973), pages 3 & 4. In the same essay Capote describes how a visit to his childhood home brought back memories that catalyzed his writing. Describing this visit Capote writes, \\"It was while exploring under the mill that I'd been bitten in the knee by a cottonmouth moccasin‚Äîprecisely as happens to Joel Knox.\\" Capote uses childhood friends, acquaintances, places, and events as counterparts and prototypes for writing the symbolic tale of his own Alabama childhood. Adaptations On October 19, 1995 Artistic License Films screened a film version of Other Voices, Other Rooms directed by David Rocksavage at the Hamptons International Film Festival. The movie starred David Speck as Joel Harrison Knox, Anna Thomson as Miss Amy Skully, and Lothaire Bluteau as Randolph. The movie had its official US release on December 5, 1997.

Ruth's daughter Rachel accidentally loses Anna's pre-school daughter, Amy Lee, in the park, when Rachel is distracted by the sight of a couple making love in the woods. Rachel meets a voyeur named Rupert (vision), and they become friends as fellow outsiders while he teaches her the pleasure of observing others. They eventually go to one of Rachel's hiding places, where she has him dress like a woman. Meanwhile, Ruth tries to help Anna cope with the disappearance of Amy Lee and stays the night at her home. Robert, a professional housecleaner, has an acute sense of smell, and seeks out the people he used to see to absorb their scents and see if he can smell any feeling for him or why they stopped caring for him.

Created by Erik Larsen, she first appeared in 1992, in Savage Dragon #2 (ongoing series). There were three people who taken up the mantle The First was Jill August, the second was her niece Alison Summers but she had become a supervillain and then the third and current dart is Jane August Jill's sister. Publication history Dart has appeared in numerous issues of Savage Dragon as a supporting character, as well as being a major character in the Freak Force series and subsequent mini- series. In February 1996, she received her own eponymous three-issue limited series, written by Julie Ditrich and Bruce Love with artwork by Jozef Szekeres. Fictional character biography Jill August was born on August 12, 1969, in Detroit, Michigan. She grew up timid and demoralized, witnessing her mother's constant spousal abuse at the hands of her father, and her friends' abuse at the hands of a cruel coach at school. She witnessed her father beat her mother to death, a crime for which he was sentenced to life in prison, effectively leaving Jill an orphan. As a teenager, Jill saw a female friend being assaulted by several men in a bar in Detroit. Attempting to intervene, she fell against a dartboard hung on the barroom wall, and the men began to attack her as well. Instinctively, she used the darts to defend herself, throwing them at her attackers with astonishing accuracy, seriously injuring all of them. She subsequently decided to use this newly discovered skill to both help others and manage her feelings of helplessness (and the rage that comes with those feelings). Jill trained herself in a number of martial arts disciplines and sharpened her already formidable dart-throwing accuracy. She designed a costume and took the name \\"Dart\\" to become a superhero in Detroit. Early in her career, she occasionally teamed up with another Detroit-based hero, the narcissistic Kill-Cat. Cover to Freak Force #1 (ongoing series), December 1993. Pencils by Vic Bridges, inks by Karl Kesel. After spending three years as a Detroit-based costumed vigilante, Dart was contacted by the Chicago Police Department to solicit her participation in a new program wherein super-powered vigilantes would be recruited into the police department for legitimate service. She accepted and moved to Chicago where she met the Savage Dragon, Ricochet, Horridus, Barbaric and other super-powered recruits. The program was a failure, though, as most of the costumed heroes could not or would not cope with the realities of everyday police work (such as wearing a police uniform instead of a costume). These recruits quit en masse and, along with newfound friends Superpatriot and Mighty Man formed their own heroes-for- hire outfit known as Freak Force, under the nominal leadership of Dart. Dart attempts to assist in a reality-disruption event; however its very nature causes many of the participants to forget that there even was a problem.\\"Shattered Image\\" #2 (October 1996) After a few years of reasonable success as independent troubleshooters, Dart and most of the Freak Force were recruited by the United States government to replace Youngblood, who were presumed to have been killed by Martians. This new group was called the Special Operations Strikeforce (S.O.S.), although Dart was refused active status for a number of months due to administrators' reservations about her reliability. Once she was allowed active status, Dart participated in a raid on the fictional nation of Lieberheim to assassinate the super-powered dictator Dread Knight. During the battle, Dart was hit by an energy blast that vaporized both of her legs to just above the knee. Due to her disability, Dart was relegated to a role as Strikeforce's team trainer. Several years later, Dart and other former members of Freak Force were attacked by an evil Mighty Man while attending the funeral of Ann Stevens (the second Mighty Man). In the ensuing battle the Savage Dragon killed this evil version, and the super- powerful Mighty Man persona was passed on to Dart, enabling her to transform into a massively powerful blond male by making a magic gesture of tapping her wrists together. Alternate Earth After issue #75 of the Savage Dragon, a second, alternate Earth was introduced into that universe. Twenty-eight issues later, in #103, the original Earth was destroyed, killing virtually all of its inhabitants, including Dart, now the fourth Mighty Man. The version of Dart from the alternate Earth continued to exist, however. In that reality, she never lost her legs, but also never became Mighty Man. Less than a year after the destruction of the original Earth, this alternate Dart was murdered by the villain, Mako, who punched her head off. Jill August's niece, Alison Summers has since taken up the mantle of Dart, though Alison has become a murderous psychopath, rather than a hero. It has also been revealed that, unbeknownst to her, Dart was the daughter of veteran super-hero Sgt. Marvel (a pastiche of sorts of Batman). Her past origin, involving her abusive father, is now considered non-canon by creator Erik Larsen A third dart named Jane August who was Jill's sister and Alison's other aunt who had take up the mantle replacing her sister but unlike her niece Alison she was a hero just like the original. Powers and abilities Dart has an uncanny, almost preternatural accuracy with various forms of throwing darts, and is able to throw consistently on- target even while performing complicated gymnastic, acrobatic or martial arts maneuvers. She carries with her a number of \\"trick\\" darts in addition to the normal ones that are merely razor sharp. There are a number of different types of trick darts: some are explosive, some incendiary, and some release toxic or irritating gas, such as tear gas. Dart is in excellent physical condition and is a skilled martial artist.

Terminology  Tambor means drum in Portuguese, and refers to the importance of the rhythmic element to worship. Mina derives from the name S√£o Jorge da Mina, now also known as Elmina Castle, and refers to a designation given to African slaves, although the name did not necessarily refer to slaves who had passed through the fortress/port of S√£o Jorge da Mina itself, but rather to \\"different ethnicities over time and place\\". For example, 'Mina-Popo' was often the designation for people from Little Popo, originally Akan speakers who had migrated from west of the Volta River, and \\"Mina-Nago\\" and \\"Mina- Congo\\" were other designations sometimes found in Brazil.  History  Slavery in Maranh√£o was concentrated in the Itapecuru Valley, the Baixada Maranhense, and S√£o Lu√≠s, which is the capital of the Brazilian state of Maranhao. Cotton and sugar cane plantations contributed heavily to the development of larger cities. Colonial houses were built with slave labor with their unique design influenced by the harmony, beauty, and choreography of songs originating from ancient Africa.  Beliefs  Tambor of Mina worships vodums, orix√°s, and entities (also called Encantados, spirits of people) who are called gentis (if they are European kings, princes and nobles, like King Sebastian of Portugal, King Manoel, King Lu√≠s) or caboclos (if they are of native origin, or Turcos of moorish kings origin, or indigenous people, like Pai Turquia, Jo√£o da Mata Rei da Bandeira, V√≥ Surrupira, Sult√£o das Matas, and many others). Voduns, gods of the fon or jeje people, are forces of nature and deified human ancestors. Some young voduns called toqu√©m or toquenos fulfill the function of guides, messengers, helpers of the other voduns. Tob√≥ssis are infantile feminine deities, considered daughters of voduns. The voduns are grouped in 5 families: Davice (or the dahomean royal family, like T√≥i Zomad√¥nu, T√≥i Dadarr√¥, Noch√™ Sepazin); Quevio√ß√¥ (or Nag√¥ voduns, such as T√≥i Bad√© Nenem Quevio√ß√¥, Noch√™ Sob√¥ Babadi, Nan√£, T√≥i L√¥co, T√≥i Averequete); Dambir√° (who cures the plague and other diseases, like T√≥i Ac√≥ssi Sapat√° Odan and T√≥i Azile); Aladanu; Savaluno (like Azac√°). Each family occupies a specific part of the house and has its own songs, behaviors, and activities. There are about 45 voduns and 15 tobossis in Casa das Minas. The title of T√≥i means that vodum is a male and the title of Noch√™ means that vodum is a female. Avievodum is the Supreme God, and Legba is not considered a messenger, being identified as an evil spirit by the Casa das Minas, although he plays an important role in other temples. Tambor de Mina is a mixture of Dahomey Religion, fon (jeje), Yoruba Religion (nag√¥), Fanti-Ashanti, Ketu, Agrono or Cambinda (Angola-Congo), Indigenous American and European traditions (Roman Catholicism). It is said that the encantados are entities of people who did not die, but disappeared mysteriously, becoming invisible or turning into animals or plants, living in a magical kingdom called Encantaria. The encantados are present in diverse Amazon beliefs (like the legend of Boto) and they are also organized in families in the Tambor de Mina: Len√ßol (that lives in the island of Len√ß√≥is, in Cururupu, in Maranh√£o, like the King Sebastian and T√≥ia Jarina); Cod√≥ (its leader is L√©gua-Boji); Turquia (like Cabocla Mariana, Herondina); Bandeira (its leader is Jo√£o da Mata Rei da Bandeira); Gama; Bahia; Surrupira, and others. They are also invoked in religious ceremonies and the priest or priestess goes into trance.The interior of Casa das Minas, a temple of Tambor de MinaDue to the cultural richness and syncretism present in the cult, these elements coexist in a harmonious way, being almost impossible to separate popular Catholicism, local folklore and the Encantaria, the Cure or Pajelan√ßa from the Tambor de Mina (in festive rites called Brinquedo de Cura; or Tambor de Curador, in the city of Cururupu). It is said that the pantheon of encantados shared by the two religions \\"navigate in the two waters\\", being the Tambor de Mina classified as \\"sea water line\\" and the Cura/Pajelan√ßa as \\"fresh water line\\". In the temples of Tambor de Mina, it is common to hold feasts and parties of the popular culture of Maranh√£o that are sometimes requested by spiritual entities that like them, such as the Feast of the Divine Holy Spirit, Bumba-meu-boi, Tambor de Crioula, and others. Terec√¥ is the denomination of one of the Afro- Brazilian religions of the city of Cod√≥ (called capital of macumba or capital of magic, by the great number of terreiros, the temples of Afro-Brazilian religions) in Maranh√£o and Teresina in Piau√≠, derived from Tambor de Mina.  Temples and priesthood  Casa das Minas, in S√£o Lu√≠s. There are two main models of Tambor de Mina in Maranh√£o: Jeje and Nag√¥. The former seems to be the oldest and settled around the Casa Grande das Minas Jeje, better known as Casa das Minas (Querebent√£ de T√≥i Zomad√¥nu or House of Minas), the oldest temple (terreiro), which must have been founded in S√£o Lu√≠s in the 1840s. The other, which is almost contemporary and which continues to this day, has settled around the Casa de Nag√¥ (House of Nag√¥). Casa das Minas and Casa de Nag√¥ are located in the same neighborhood. The Casa das Minas (Querebent√£ of T√≥i Zomad√¥nu) is unique; it does not have houses that are affiliated to it. It was founded by an African woman named Maria Jesuina, who came to Brazil as a slave and, according to Pierre Verger, was the Queen N√£ Agontim√©, wife of King Agongl√¥ of Dahomey and mother of King Guez√¥. The most famous priestess (vondunsi) of the temple was Mother Andresa Maria, considered the last princess of Fon direct lineage that headed the Casa das Minas. She was born in 1854 and died in 1954, at the age of 100. In this house, the songs are in language jeje (Ewe-Fon) and deities called voduns are worshipped, but although it does not have affiliated houses, the cult model of the Tambor de Mina is greatly influenced by the Casa das Minas. In the Casa das Minas, only women can command religious ceremonies. They are called vodunsis, the priestess of Tambor de Mina. The men had a special function of drum players (abat√°s players; hence, the definition of \\"abatazeiros\\"). The last vodunsi, Dona Deni, died in 2015, having been no full priesthood initiation rituals (vod√∫nsi- gonja√≠) since 1914 (for reasons not clarified), without other vodunsis to the trance by the invocation of voduns. Casa das Minas is currently managed by Euz√©bio Pinto, the grandson of vondusi Dona Am√©lia. There are still many festivals of popular culture in the temple, such as the Feast of the Divine Holy Spirit, Tambor de Crioula, Bumba-meu-boi and others (that traditionally were requested by the voduns who liked them), with the Casa das Minas continuing with much cultural relevance. The Casa de Nag√¥ (Nagon Abioton) was founded by Josefa (Zefa de Nag√¥) and Maria Joana Travassos, who were African women of yourub√° tradition, and helped by the founder of Casa das Minas. They worship voduns, orix√°s (Yoruba deities), gentis, and caboclos. The House of Nag√¥ influenced the formation of the other terreiros (temples) of S√£o Lu√≠s. Various objects of the Afro-Maranhense culture, especially the Tambor de Mina, as accessories of clothing and support, used in the rituals of Casa das Minas, Casa de Nag√¥, and other terreiros of Maranh√£o can be found in Cafu√° das Merc√™s (Black Museum), in Sao Lu√≠s. There are hundreds of temples of Tambor de Mina, headed by women called vodunsis and men called vodunos, in Maranh√£o (like Casa Fanti Ashanti), or with origin from Maranh√£o, in Piau√≠, Par√° (Terreiro de Tambor de Mina Dois Irm√£os), Amazonas, in the southeastern region, like the Casa das Minas Toya Jarina, in the state of S√£o Paulo.

It is part of the common law of England and Wales. The case concerns foreseeability of psychiatric damage and creates an important distinction between primary and secondary victims in the English law of negligence relating to the recovery of such damage. Facts The plaintiff, Mr Page, was involved in a minor car accident, and was physically unhurt in the collision. However the crash did result in a recurrence of myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome) from which he had suffered for 20 years but was then in remission. The defendant admitted that he had been negligent, but said he was not liable for the psychiatric damage as it was unforeseeable and therefore not recoverable as a head of damage. Judgment The leading judgment was given by Lord Lloyd of Berwick who, following from the factual distinction made by Lord Oliver in Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, held that Mr Page was a primary victim. Mr Page had been directly involved in the accident, and therefore his case was of a different nature than those that had come previously before the House of Lords. His Lordship held that this factual distinction also had legal consequences, those being that the restrictions that were put in place in order to limit the extent of the defendant's duty to secondary victims, did not apply to Mr Page's case. Therefore, it did not have to be shown that nervous shock or psychiatric injury needed to be a foreseeable consequence of what happened - Mr Page only had to show that a personal injury (describing a broader type of damage) was a foreseeable consequence. In the case of direct victims, their Lordships said the following test should be applied: \\"Could the defendant reasonably foresee that his conduct would expose the plaintiff to the risk of personal injury, psychological or physical?\\" If the answer was yes, it would be irrelevant that the extent of the damage was unforeseeable because the plaintiff had special sensitivities - the rule founded in other nervous shock cases that the plaintiff should be of reasonable fortitude was found to be irrelevant. This is based on the eggshell skull rule, that is, one \\"takes the plaintiff as one finds him\\". Consequently, the defendant was found liable for the nervous shock suffered by Mr Page. The majority judgment has been critically received by most academics.Handford, P Tort Liability for Psychiatric Harm (2006, Australia, Law Book Co) The minority followed the decision of the Court of Appeal, finding that in all cases of psychiatric injury the test in establishing a duty of care was whether the kind of damage (psychiatric damage) was foreseeable and not just whether or not it was foreseeable that harm (of any type) might come to the plaintiff.Page v Smith [1995] 2 Lloyd's Rep95 This is to be judged ex post facto, taking into account what actually happened. When establishing a duty, the plaintiff's unusual susceptibility is of relevance to the question of duty - once it is established that the type of damage (nervous shock) is foreseeable, then the 'eggshell personality' rule comes into operation, and the exact nature and extent of that damage need not have been foreseeable. The minority found that in the circumstances - a moderate collision where neither Mr Page or Mr Smith and his passengers suffered any physical injuries and where vehicular damage was only moderate - that nervous shock was not foreseeable. It does not follow that whenever there is physical injury that psychiatric injury will be foreseeable, therefore, the test is based on the type of damage. The rule created in Page v Smith was later restricted (Rothwell v Chemical & Insulating Co)[2007] UKHL 39, [2008] 1 AC 281 to apply only to cases where the complainant suffers psychiatric illness as an immediate result of the incident - a mere endangerment resulting in worry which later turns into psychiatric illness does not suffice.

They started to experiment with sounds of hip hop, big beat, breakbeat and downtempo. With the 2007 release Spare Time Machine the band gave up on sampling and concentrated on vintage music styles including Psychedelia, Baroque Pop and Surf Rock. DJ Slow departed the band in 2001 to pursue solo projects. JA-Jazz has been off-duty since 2008. Multi-instrumentalist Paul Malmstr√∂m became official member of the band in 2008. The Pepe Delux√© live line-up consists of Mirkka Paajanen (vocals), Miikka Paatelainen (guitar, theremin), Markku Reinikainen (drums), Ville Riippa (keyboards), James Spectrum (mixing, percussion) and Edward Greendanger (VJ). History The band's first release was a song called \\"Call Me Goldfinger\\". It was released in 1997 on the \\"Return of the DJ, Vol. II\\" scratch-DJ compilation album by Bomb Hip-Hop Records. After the release, the band continued making new Pepe Delux√© -music and also remixes for Finnish dance music -artists. The band's first EP, Three Times a Player, 1998, was actually a demo released under an imaginary record label Tiger. It was still chosen as the downtempo album of the month by Muzik magazine in the UK. This led to a recording contract with Brighton's Catskills Records. The band's first album, Super Sound, was released 1999. Due to clearance problems (the tracks were heavily sampled), they had to do a new version of the album with many of the tracks re-created with cleared samples or with live instruments. The new version of the album was released subsequently in France, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, United States, Australia and Germany. The album was selected as an \\"Album of the Month\\" by several magazines. Super Sound was noticed by Paul Malmstr√∂m from Fallon Worldwide advertising agency in New York, and the band was asked to write music for an upcoming Lee Jeans advertisement campaign. Later on, Pepe Delux√©'s sound was also noted by another jeans company, Levi's, which chose the track \\"Before You Leave\\" (based heavily on an original composition by Tony Hatch) for their worldwide advertising campaign in 2001, subsequently winning the Gold Lion for best use of music in Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. The track reached No. 20 in the UK Singles Chart the same year, and it was also used on the end credits for the Channel 4 comedy quiz show, Alan Carr's Celebrity Ding Dong. During this time, Pepe Delux√© undertook several remixes for acts such as Tom Jones, The Cardigans, Eminem and Jacknife Lee. In 2003, the band returned with their first single \\"Salami Fever\\" from their second album Beatitude. It was composed together with Paul Malmstr√∂m and it was their first collaboration. They also created a video for the single (showing a master training an apprentice in martial arts using salami and bacon), which was chosen as 'Video of the Decade' by Bizarre magazine. \\"Salami Fever\\" was sampled by The Prodigy on their song \\"Take Me to the Hospital\\". In spring 2007, they released the first single, \\"Pussy Cat Rock\\", from their third album Spare Time Machine, the latter of which was released in June 2007. Further singles \\"Mischief Of Cloud 6\\" (August) and \\"Go For Blue\\" (September) followed. In October 2007, \\"Mischief Of Cloud 6\\" was used at the beginning of an episode of the ABC drama Private Practice, entitled \\"In Which Addison Finds the Magic\\". In October 2011, Asthmatic Kitty announced that they would be releasing the fourth Pepe Delux√© album in conjunction with Catskills. The esoteric pop opera in three parts was titled Queen of the Wave. It was released in January 2012. November of the same year saw the band stretching their singular contribution to the avant garde by obtaining financial support from pornstar Ron Jeremy, via the sale of a one-off EP made exclusively for their endowed endower. Pepe Delux√© composed the soundtrack for the Angry Birds Go! racing game released in December, 2013.

Early in his career, Dlugos was celebrated for his energetic, openly gay, pop culture-infused poems. Later, he became widely known for the poems he wrote as he was dying of AIDS. Early life and college Tim Dlugos was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, and raised by adopted parents in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, and Arlington, Virginia. In 1968, he joined the Christian Brothers, a Catholic religious order, and entered their college, La Salle College, in Philadelphia, the following year. At La Salle, Dlugos became involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement and started writing poetry. He left the Brothers in 1971 to openly embrace a politically active, gay lifestyle. Less and less motivated by academic life, he dropped out of La Salle in his senior year, eventually moving to Washington, D.C. Washington, D.C. Dlugos immersed himself in the Mass Transit poetry scene in Washington, regularly attending readings at the Community Book Shop in Dupont Circle. His friends during this period included Ed Cox, Tina Darragh, Michael Lally, Bernard Welt, and Terence Winch. His first chapbook, High There, was published by Some of Us Press in 1973. Dlugos worked on Ralph Nader's Public Citizen newspaper, which led to a successful career as a fundraising consultant and copywriter for liberal and charitable organizations. Years in New York In 1976, Dlugos moved to Manhattan, where he became a prominent younger poet in the downtown literary scene centered around the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church. His poems were praised for their innovation and wit, their appropriation of popular culture (as in his crowd-pleasing \\"Gilligan's Island\\"), and their openly gay subject matter. Dlugos's friends during his New York years included Joe Brainard, Donald Britton, Jane DeLynn, Brad Gooch, and Eileen Myles. In 1977, he began a correspondence and friendship with Dennis Cooper, then based in Los Angeles. Dlugos published two books with Cooper's Little Caesar Press: Je Suis Ein Americano (1979) and Entre Nous (1982). Of the latter, critic Marjorie Perloff wrote, \\"This is poetry of extraordinary speed and energy that fuses fact and fantasy, dream and documentary. Tim Dlugos' every nerve seems to vibrate.\\" Dlugos also edited and contributed to such magazines as Christopher Street, New York Native, and The Poetry Project Newsletter. AIDS and death Dlugos tested positive for HIV in 1987, and was diagnosed with AIDS in 1989. In 1988, he moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where he was enrolled in Yale Divinity School. His intention was to become a priest in the Episcopal Church. He died of complications due to AIDS on December 3, 1990, at the age of forty. Dlugos is widely known for the poems he wrote while hospitalized in G-9, the AIDS ward at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan, and is considered a seminal poet of the AIDS epidemic. His long poem \\"G-9,\\" in which Dlugos celebrates life while accepting his mortality and impending death, was published in The Paris Review only months before Dlugos died. Legacy Two decades after Dlugos's death, his friend David Trinidad edited A Fast Life: The Collected Poems of Tim Dlugos, which won a Lambda Literary Award. In 2011, \\"At Moments Like These He Feels Farthest Away,\\" an exhibition of paintings by artist Philip Monaghan based on Dlugos's poem \\"Gilligan's Island,\\" was held at Fales Library at New York University, where Dlugos's literary papers are archived.

The hat-trick is a classic magic trick where a performer will produce an object (traditionally a rabbit or a bouquet of flowers) out of an apparently empty top hat.Randi, James. Conjuring.  Method  In its simplest form, the trick works by placing the hat on a specially made table or chest. Both the hat, and the surface it is placed on, will have a hidden opening in them, through which an object stored in a compartment in the table or chest can be pulled. Alternatively, the performer can produce an item hidden in their sleeve using sleight of hand and misdirection. This eliminates the need to place the hat on a surface, and also allows the performer to give the hat to an audience member for inspection. However, producing a rabbit from a hat using nothing but sleight of hand is a much more difficult trick. This trick is also traditionally performed for children, since it is a basic trick with basic props. It is said that the earliest magician to pull a rabbit out of a hat was Louis Comte, in 1814,Severn, Bill, Bill Severn's Big Book of Magic, 1980, p. 212. though this is also attributed to the much later John Henry Anderson.QI, A Series, Episode 3  Pop culture  Top hat as an icon for magic This magic trick is so well known that it has been referenced in a wide variety of media. The top hat used for the trick has become almost synonymous with stage magicians, and is commonly used as an icon to represent magic (such as the example on the right). Likewise, rabbits are so commonly associated with the trick that rabbits are often used to represent magic in general.

He was an advisor to the conservative Texas millionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt.anonymous; \\"Gary Allen, 50, Dies in West; Spread Conservatives' View\\", Associated Press, published in The New York Times on December 2, 1986. Allen was the father of four children, including Michael Allen, a political news journalist. Allen died in 1986 in Long Beach, California, at the age of 50 of a liver ailment. Writing In 1971, Allen wrote with Larry Abraham a book titled None Dare Call It Conspiracy (prefaced by U.S. Representative John G. Schmitz of California's 35th congressional district and the nominee of the American Independent Party in the 1972 U.S. presidential election). It sold more than four million copiesWallis W. Woods, Introduction to 1990 edition by Buccaneer Books during the 1972 presidential campaign opposing Nixon and U.S. Senator George S. McGovern. In this book, Allen and Abraham assert that the modern political and economic systems in most developed nations are the result of a sweeping conspiracy by the Establishment's power elite, for which he also uses the term Insiders. According to the authors, these Insiders use elements of Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto to forward their socialist/communist agenda: # Establish an income tax system as a means of extorting money from the common man; # Establish a central bank, deceptively named so that people will think it is part of the government; # Have this bank be the holder of the national debt; # Run the national debt, and the interest thereon, sky high through wars (or any sort of deficit spending), starting with World War I.Michael Billig and Jovan Byford, \\"The emergence of antisemitic conspiracy theories in Yugoslavia during the war with NATO\\", Patterns of Prejudice, October 2001 He quotes the Council on Foreign Relations as having stated, in its study no. 7 : \\"The U.S. must strive to: A. BUILD A NEW INTERNATIONAL ORDER.\\" (Capitals in the original). Allen wrote other books about the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission, asserting that the term \\"New World Order\\" was used by a secretive elite dedicated to the destruction of all national sovereignties. Allen's last book, Say \\"No!\\" to the new world order, was published posthumously in January 1987. Investigative reporter Chip Berlet argues that Allen's work provides an example of a synthesis of right- wing populism and conspiracism, a blend of ideas known as producerism.

After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu by adding the Whopper sandwich in 1957, and has since added non-beef items such as chicken, fish, and vegetarian offerings, including salads and meatless sandwiches. Other additions include a breakfast menu and beverages such as Icees, juices, and bottled waters. As the company expanded both inside and outside the United States, it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs. To generate additional sales, BK occasionally introduces limited-time offers of special versions of its products, or brings out completely new products intended for either long- or short-term sales. Not all of these products and services have been successful; in 1992, Burger King introduced limited table service featuring special dinner platters, but this concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued. The chicken fries are currently halal when they were not halal in 1953‚Äì2005. The company introduced the first iteration of its breakfast menu, along with the company's \\"Specialty Sandwich\\" product line, in a 1978 menu expansion. The products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market, members of which would be willing to spend more on a higher-quality product. The expanded Burger King menu was part of a plan by then-company president Donald N. Smith to reach the broadest possible demographic market to better compete with McDonald's, and to fend off then newcomer Wendy's, who had a growing market share. The plan was successful: the company's sales increased by 15 percent. Despite another menu expansion in 1985, the company's market gains diminished due to neglect of the brand at the hands of then-parent Pillsbury and its successors, Grand Metropolitan and Diageo. When the company was sold to a group led by TPG Capital in 2004, the trend of targeting an expanded audience was renewed under a plan by its then-CEO Brad Blum. During Blum's tenure, the company added several products that featured higher-quality ingredients and other menu fare that again attempted to appeal to the adult palate and demographic. As in the past, not all of these products met corporate sales expectations, or in the case of several of its larger offerings, resulted in negative publicity due to nutritional concerns. With the purchase of the company in 2010 by 3G Capital, the company again began another revamp of its product line by phasing out some products, introducing new ones and redesigning others including its flagship Whopper sandwich. Like its menu, the equipment the company cooks its hamburgers with has also evolved as the company grew. The burgers have always been broiled mechanically; the original unit, called an Insta-Broiler, was one of two pieces of equipment the founders of Insta-Burger King purchased before opening their new restaurant. The Insta-Broiler worked by cooking 12 burger patties in a wire basket, allowing the patties to be cooked from both sides simultaneously. With the acquisition of the chain by its Miami franchisees came an improved unit dubbed a \\"Flame Broiler\\". Designed by the new owners, it featured stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain. The unit broke down less often, while maintaining a similar cooking rate. The cooking format remained for the next 40 years until Burger King developed a new, variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times. These new units began testing in 1999 and eventually evolved into the two models the company deployed system-wide in 2008‚Äì2009. Accompanying these new broilers was new food-holding equipment and a computer-based product monitoring system for its cooked products. The new system allows for more concise tracking of product quality, while giving its users a method to streamline costs by more precisely projecting sales and product usage  History  = Sandwiches and entr√©es = alt=The Whopper sandwich, Burger King's signature product When the predecessor to the modern Burger King, Insta-Burger King, opened in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, the company's menu consisted predominantly of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, and desserts. Insta-Burger King was acquired in 1954 by two of its franchisees, James McLamore and David Edgerton, who renamed it Burger King. Under its new ownership, the company continued to develop its core menu, cooking techniques, and equipment. In 1957 McLamore and Edgerton created BK's signature item, the Whopper, as a way to differentiate BK from other burger outlets at the time. The Whopper is a hamburger with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, pickle, and ketchup, that was priced at 29¬¢. The sandwich was designed to give the customer a larger product with better value than competitors, who were selling burgers with an average price of 15¬¢. As Burger King's flagship product, the Whopper has been expanded beyond the original sandwich into a line of sandwiches all made with the same ingredients. The Whopper sandwich has undergone several modifications in its recipe over the years, with a change from a plain bun to a sesame seed roll in the early 1970s and a change in patty size in the mid-1980s being two of the most notable. Since its inception, the Whopper has become synonymous with Burger King and become the focus of much of its advertising. The company has even named its kiosk-style restaurants \\"Whopper Bars\\". In 1978, Donald N. Smith was hired from McDonald's to help restructure the corporate operations of Burger King to better compete against his former company as well as the then up-and-coming chain, Wendy's. As part of an operational overhaul he dubbed \\"Operation Phoenix\\", one of his first changes to the company's menu was to add the Burger King specialty sandwich line in 1979. This line‚Äîwith many non-hamburger sandwiches, including chicken and fish‚Äîsignificantly expanded the breadth of the BK menu. It was one of the first attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing to spend more on a higher quality product. The new products were successful, and the company's sales increased by 15 percent. While most of the line has since been discontinued, the company's Original Chicken Sandwich is still offered in all of its global markets, and the ham and cheese sandwich is a regional offering. BK Chicken Tenders made their debut in a menu revision and expansion in 1985 to address the absence of a chicken-based finger product akin to McDonald's Chicken McNuggets. The product had to be temporarily withdrawn because of limited availability of chicken meat; it was re-introduced about six months later. Originally made with sliced fillets of chicken, the product was changed to a formed chopped-chicken product several years later. In 1987, BK rolled out the Burger Bundles, a pack of six mini burger sliders, similar to White Castle was brought back later as the \\"Burger Buddy\\". Fish Tenders were introduced to complement Chicken Tenders during a menu expansion in 1989. The new fish product, sold in the same style of container as the Chicken Tenders, was an order of fish sticks with Tartar sauce for dipping. Portion sizes were similar to those of the Chicken Tenders. Fish Tenders were discontinued in 1990. alt=BK Original Chicken Sandwich The company introduced its first broiled chicken sandwich, the BK Broiler, in 1990. The sandwich included a dill-ranch mayonnaise and was served on an oat-bran roll. In 1998, BK reformulated the BK Broiler into a larger, more male-oriented sandwich: a larger chicken patty with mayonnaise served on a Whopper bun. In 2002, BK changed the name of the sandwich to Chicken Whopper and added a smaller Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich. The company replaced the Chicken Whopper line with another broiled sandwich line in 2003, the BK Baguette line. The chicken sandwich, served on a fresh cooked baguette roll, and came in several varieties, all of which were topped with a series of ingredients that were low in fat. They were sold in the United States at one time, but are now sold only in the European market. The failed Baguette line was replaced in North America with the current grilled chicken iteration, the TenderGrill sandwich. Although Wendy's was the first to have a value menu in 1989, Burger King decided to offer its own value menu in 1998. This menu featured seven products: the Whopper Jr., a five-piece Chicken Tenders, a bacon cheeseburger, medium-sized French fries, medium soft drink, medium onion rings, and a small milkshake ‚Äì all priced at 99¬¢ (USD). In 2002 and 2006, BK revamped its value menu by adding and removing several products such as chili and the Rodeo Cheeseburger. Many of these items, such as Chili, tacos, the Sourdough burger (a product similar to the Whopper Jr., but with sourdough bread), and Chicken Tender sandwiches have since been discontinued, modified, or relegated to regional menu options. Returning to the practice of targeting the adult demographic as it had in 1978, BK introduced several new products to its menu in 2003. The new products included new or revamped chicken sandwiches, a new salad line, and its BK Joe brand of coffee. The first of these items was the TenderCrisp chicken sandwich, an entirely new sandwich which featured a fried whole-muscle chicken breast on a corn-dusted roll. The sandwich was part of then-CEO Greg Brenneman's plans to bolster the company's revived \\"Have it your way\\" advertising program, which was designed to draw younger people to its stores. Some items, including the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line, brought negative attention due to the large portion size, amounts of unhealthy fats, and the presence of trans-fats. At the time, many of the products featured higher-quality ingredients like whole chicken breast, Angus beef, Cheddar cheese, and pepper jack cheese. Not all the products new products introduced under Blum's tenure met corporate sales expectations, the Baguette Chicken sandwiches being an example. Others products, such as Burger King's line of \\"indulgent\\" burgers originally called the Angus Burger, have undergone multiple reformulations. The Angus Steak burger was originally based around a frozen patty; despite high expectations from the company, the sandwich fared poorly. After a reformulating program, it was relaunched in 2008 as the Angus Steakhouse burger. With the introduction of a new multifunction broiler capable of cooking a more diverse set of products, Burger King replaced the Angus Steakhouse burger with the Steakhouse XT burger in 2009. In 2011, the company discontinued selling the product in the North American market, replacing it with the Chef's Choice Burger. The Chef's Choice Burger was removed in 2012. 2014 saw the introduction of the newest attempt at introducing a premium burger to the company's portfolio with the introduction of the A.1. Ultimate Cheeseburger in North America. The Burger Bundles returned in 2011 with beef and chicken patty options. = Ancillaries = alt=Zesty onion ring sauce packet During 1997, BK revamped its French fries in North America. The improved fries were coated with a layer of potato-based starch, giving the fries a crisp shell that maintained its texture longer. The company introduced them in a series of advertisements that claimed the new fries tasted better than McDonald's fries in consumer taste comparisons. Other ads featured Mr. Potato Head in a series of demographically-targeted commercials. The fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato wedges, a type of French fry that is thick-cut and wedge-shaped. In 1991, the company introduced Twister fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal was they were served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry carton. The product was designed as a short-term promotion that would be periodically reintroduced. In 2002, Burger King offered \\"Shake 'em up Fries\\", which included a bag of fries and a packet of spices. The customer would add the spices to the fries and then shake the bag until the fries were coated. Beyond French fries, the company has introduced several other side products over the course of its existence. Onion rings have been part of the menu for the majority of BK history. Originally made from whole, sliced onions, they were reformulated into a formed product made from onion paste in 2001 as part of a menu revamp. In the same 2001 menu revamp, the company added an onion ring-specific dipping sauce, and emphasized it again during its 99¬¢ BK Value Menu introduction in 2002. As part of its BK Cravers value menu introduction in 2005, the company briefly sold jalape√±o poppers accompanied by a side of ranch dressing as part of its national menu. The same menu added mozzarella sticks with a side of marinara sauce; the mozzarella sticks have since been relegated to a regional menu item in the United States, but are sold on the national menu in Canada. = Breakfast = alt=BK Croissan'Wich One of Smith's significant contributions to the menu was the addition of a breakfast product line as part of the 1978 product line expansion. Up until that point, breakfast was not a market Burger King had served. Other than the addition of the Croissan'Wich in 1983, the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the McDonald's offerings until a menu revamp in 1986. This expansion introduced BK's A.M. Express product line, which included French toast sticks and mini-muffins. The new breakfast line was designed to be portable, because studies had shown that an increasing percent of consumers were eating breakfast on the go. Shortly after the introduction of the French toast stick products, BK partnered with Lender's Bagels to introduce a bagel breakfast sandwich. The new product was designed to drive sales in the morning by piquing customer's curiosity with a new taste. The product was tested for several months in BK's original home territory of Miami before a national roll-out. In the late 1990s, BK co-branded several of its breakfast products with former parent Pillsbury; Pillsbury produced a fresh-baked biscuit product for the chain in 1996 and miniature cinnamon rolls called Cini-Minis in 1998. As part of the cachet built into the products, Burger King advertises that products are cooked fresh in the restaurant each morning. With the effects of the late-2000s recession reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of Quaker Oats Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal has been shown to be a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.  Regionalization  A now- shuttered kosher Burger King restaurant that was located in alt=A kosher Burger King location As the company expanded both inside and outside the United States, it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs. In countries with predominantly Islamic populations, such as Saudi Arabia, pork is not served due to Muslim dietary laws. In Muslim countries, meat is slaughtered using the halal method and labeled as such. Similar adaptations also occurred in Israel, where kosher dietary laws forbid the mixture of meat and dairy products. Before the company exited the country in 2010, many of its locations in Israel were fully kosher. In many international markets, BK offers products or condiments that fit local tastes. For example, in Canada, BK offers poutine gravy and vinegar for its French fries, and peri-peri sauce is available as a sandwich topping in the United Kingdom. Hungry Jack's, Burger King's Australian franchise, offers the \\"Aussie burger\\" with fried egg, beetroot, and other Australian flavors. In Asian markets, dark-meat chicken is preferred over white meat, and poultry products sold in these markets often are advertised as such. One of the more regionally differentiated lines of products is the company's dessert offerings. In the United States, BK offers several desserts, including Otis Spunkmeyer chocolate-chip cookies, apple pie slices, Hershey's Sundae pie slices (a type of chocolate creme pie), and a rotating pie as part of its dessert menu. Internationally the company sells turnovers, tortas, Cini-Minis, muffins, brownies, and vanilla soft-serve ice cream in cones and sundaes. In most markets where BK sells ice cream, it also sells a mix-in dessert under various names. Some of these international dessert products differ from the domestic products in terms of preparation; an example is the pies sold in Asian countries that are fried, turnover-style, instead of the deep-dish tart style associated with American sweet-filled pies. While in most Southeast Asian markets such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, rice is also available as a temporary or permanent fixture in the local menu. The rice-based meals are visibly divergent between these countries, in order to suit the local taste of each respective market.  Preparation methods  Burger King cooks its foods in one of five ways: broiling, deep frying, baking, microwaving or frying. As noted in its mottos and advertisements, BK cooks its burgers and grilled chicken on an automated grill,Earl, Employee of the Month advertisement by Crispin Porter + Bogusky, 2006 while its other chicken products, fish, sides, and breakfast sausage are deep-fried in vegetable oil. BK prepares its biscuits, cinnamon rolls, and cookies by baking in a convection oven and microwaves its BK Veggie burger patty. = Broiling = Duke Manufacturing, one of two models the company deployed in the United States. alt=A Burger King/Duke broiler cooking unit The predecessor to Burger King, Insta-Burger King, began deploying the original broiling device in 1952 when its owners, Matthew Burns and Kieth Kramer, acquired the rights to George Read's Inst- Shake and Insta-Broiler machines. The Insta-Broiler cooked the burgers in a wire basket between two broilers, allowing the burgers to be cooked on both sides simultaneously. The machine was capable of cooking over 400 patties per hour, which allowed the company to grow rapidly. When McLamore and Edgarton opened their first Insta-Burger King location in Miami, they revamped the unit into what they called a \\"flame broiler\\" ‚Äì the forerunner of the modern unit used by Burger King today. After the acquisition of Insta-Burger King in 1954, the pair contracted the construction of the newly designed flame broilers to the SaniServ company of Indianapolis, Indiana, for the initial run of broilers. Eventually, the company moved the manufacturing contract for the broiler units to Nieco Automatic Broilers of Windsor, California, who manufactured all subsequent units until the start of the 2000s. When the time came for the company to develop a new broiler, it turned to its equipment manufacturer, Nieco, and St. Louis, Missouri-based Duke Manufacturing. Burger King's goal was to maintain the company's trademark flame broiling method while allowing more product options on a flexible cooking platform. The solutions that Nieco and Duke devised met that goal by using control features during cooking. The cooking methods employed by the two manufacturing companies vary in their methods; Nieco employed two chains, one that maintained a single speed and cooking temperature, and another that had a flexible speed setting and variable temperature control. Duke's solution utilizes an oven that cooks according to preset parameters for time and temperature, one heterogeneous product batch at a time. The first batch-style broiler was introduced in April 1999 and was tested in-store in central Wisconsin during the summer of 1999. alt=A Burger King/Nieco broiler cooking unit Beyond the flexibility of the new broilers, the new equipment has several features intended to decrease operational costs. A more efficient design of the burners in the Nieco units produces a 30 percent reduction in energy consumption. The Duke units produce a $4,000 -$5,000 annual savings on energy compared to the original units, which ran approximately at full capacity all day. The units are so fuel-efficient that in many US states, the company and its franchises qualify for energy-efficiency rebates. However, and issue arose in September 2011 when the state of Washington department of health warned Burger King of issues with the Duke units. In multiple incidents in seven counties throughout the state, the Duke units were found to have cracked heat spreaders which resulted in under cooked products. Additionally, there was foreign material contamination caused by loose insulation resulting from the cracks as well as other issues. Upon notification, Burger King released a statement that the company has notified franchisees and corporate-owned stores operating the Duke units with orders to repair the problem immediately. Additional training for operators was also ordered. = Kitchen equipment = alt=A Burger King kitchen located in Italy Before any products are sold, the company pre-cooks the ingredients and holds them in a heated holding cabinet. To ensure that product consistency is maintained and to reduce the amount of products discarded as waste, Burger King utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by Integrated Control Corp, or ICC. The system, called Kitchen Minder, monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The initial test designs were time- consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or serial port. A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and actual usage. Along with the holding system, Burger King deployed newer high- speed toasters to decrease make times; the new toasters, while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall labor costs. = Sandwich preparation = During periods of high-volume sales, BK will pre-prepare high- demand items such as hamburgers and cheeseburgers; during slower periods all sandwiches are made to order. The Whopper sandwiches, premium sandwiches, and BK Veggies are all made when ordered.  Demographic targeting  = Value = alt=Burger King Buck Double BK targets \\"value-oriented\\" customers with its BK Value Menu. In the United States, this menu contains products that are usually priced in the $1.00 to $1.49 range. In non-US markets, the BK Value Menu typically takes on a different name, with prices set to reflect the approximate value of one US dollar. Internationally, the company is standardizing its value menu under the King Deals banners that features items for sale at ‚Ç¨1.00 in the EU and one dirham in Dubai. In all the markets, the value menu usually includes smaller sandwiches and entr√©es, small-sized side orders, small-sized drinks, and desserts. In the United States, the value menu has a breakfast offering in the same format as the lunch/dinner value menu. = Children = As with all major fast food vendors, BK has a menu that specifically targets children. The company introduced its child-oriented product line in North America during the summer of 1990 with an advertising program called the Burger King Kid's Club. In the United States, the meal is called the Kids Club Meal and it is primarily positioned against the popular Happy Meal from McDonald's. The meal includes an entr√©e, a side order, beverage, and a toy. The toy is usually a product tie-in with a movie or television show. The entr√©e and side offerings differ from market to market, as does portion size. In the North American market, BK further divides its children's menu into three segments: toddler, kids, and \\"tween\\". The only difference between the first two groups is the prize offering; the toddler will receive an age-appropriate toy. The toys were originally designed by Kentwood, Michigan-based Sassy Inc., and were introduced in 2000 as a supplement to the company's existing children's line. Burger King changed its toddler toy designer to Hudson, Ohio-based Little Tikes in 2003. The tween offering, introduced in 1999, is called the Big Kids Meal. The Big Kids Meals consist of a double hamburger, a double cheeseburger, or a six-piece serving of Chicken Tenders plus a small order of fries, and a drink, and a toy. Further additions to the line included a six-piece serving of the company's Chicken Fries product. The introduction of the Big Kids Meal was not without controversy. McDonald's challenged Burger King's use of the name in a federal suit that claimed McDonald's had used the name first. According to the filing, McDonald's stated the company had used the term in a limited manner in Michigan in 1998 as part of a promotion in Detroit. The suit was judged to be without merit and dismissed in a summary judgment. = Adult = alt=BK Chicken Fries To appeal to the adult market, BK offers several sandwiches and other products made with higher-quality ingredients such as whole-breast chicken fillets, Angus beef, and other \\"premium\\" ingredients. These sandwiches are usually served on a better-quality roll, such as baguettes or corn-dusted potato rolls. Through 2009 and 2010, the company added other higher-end product such as barbecued ribs, grilled fish, an improved grilled chicken sandwich, kebabs, and an extra-thick burger called the Steakhouse XT. Several industry publications claimed that these new offerings disrupt the differentiation between the fast-food and casual-dining markets with a combination of taste, competitive pricing, speed of service, and convenience. The adult-oriented products of Burger King and its competitors have been criticized by restaurant industry commentators as a temporary blip. The \\"indulgent\\" products are seen as blurring the lines between the fast-food and casual-dining market segments and, while they draw in newer customers looking for value, the effect may only be temporary. The Muslims are permitted to eat the chicken fries and other flavors of chicken fries in burger king because it is denoting or relating to meat prepared as prescribed by Muslim law. Once the economic instabilities of the late-2000s recession fade, customers may return to such casual chains as Chili's and leave the fast food chains back where they started in terms of customer numbers and profits. BK targets specific sub-groups within the adult market. Products like the BK Stacker and BK XXL are aimed at late teen to young adult males; health-conscious individuals are offered products such as salads, grilled chicken, and veggie burgers. Products such as the BK Veggie, a meatless burger initially introduced in 2002, target the female and health-oriented demographic using a co-branded marketing program and a patty produced by the Kellogg Company's Morningstar Farms division. Another sub-market in this group is on-the-go parents and commuters; The company's BK Chicken Fries‚ÄîFrench-fry cut pieces of breaded chicken‚Äîis specifically targeted to this segment. First introduced in 2005, the product was successful enough that Burger King expanded the marketing of chicken fries to the children's demographic with a kid's meal version of the product in 2007. The meal was launched with a cross-promotion in conjunction with Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants. The series of commercials raised the ire of the American Family Association due to perceived nudity concerns. = The \\"Superfan\\" = One particular market target that was of importance to the company was identified as the \\"Superfan\\". The superfan was a demographic group that included individuals that are 18 to 49 years old, primarily male, who would visit a fast-food restaurant five times a month and eat fast food 16 times a month. Burger King and their competitors hope to attract this group because of the large sums of money that they represent; an increase in sales to this group could drive an increase in global sales. While superfans accounted for less than 20 percent of Burger King's customer base, they accounted for nearly 50 percent of the company's business. By focusing on this demographic group, the company could increase sales more readily; it was easier to generate more repeat visits by this demographic than it was to coax new customers to switch from other chains. The company has used advertising featuring its mascot, the Burger King, in tandem with new product rollouts such as its BK Wrapper product to help generate an increased number of visits by this client segment. With the slowing of the global economy due to the financial crisis of 2007-2010, the company experienced a downside of focusing so much on this demographic group. The high unemployment of the recession, coupled with healthier eating habits, drove many customers away from fast food towards the fast-casual segment or forced them to stop eating out. Analysts have stated that by focusing its marketing and advertising programs on men, BK alienated women and children. Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass stated, \\"Maybe catering to the super fan was the correct strategy to kick-start the business, but maybe they relied on that for too long...\\" To help counter the perceived male bias of its superfan target group, the company expanded the definition in early 2010 to cover individuals of both sexes, all ages, and households who frequent fast food within the stated time frame. Throughout 2010, the company added newer calorie-conscious \\"Positive Steps\\" combo meals that were advertised in female-oriented media, as well as a continuing cross-promotional tie-in with the female-oriented Twilight film series. 3G Capital's new management team eliminated the focus on the superfan after its acquisition the company in 2010, concentrating on a more broad demographic base that includes women and more health conscious customers.  Nutrition  One of the company's first forays into healthier products was in 1983 with introduction of its salad bar. The salad bar met with light to moderate success, but the company's franchise holders complained of high operating costs and a poor return on investment. Part of the product, a pita salad, was quickly dropped from the salad bar, as were plans to use the bar unit to boost breakfast sales. In 1987 the company augmented its salad bar with a test line of prepackaged salads, including chef and garden salads. The salad bar was eventually eliminated in favor of packaged salads. In 1990, BK introduced a new salad line accompanied by a licensing agreement with Paul Newman's Newman's Own, Inc., whose salad dressings accompanied the products. Burger King revamped its salad line again in 2004, with the introduction of its Fire Grilled Salad products. Burger King sought to differentiate this line of salads by packaging the warm meat toppings‚Äîa choice of grilled shrimp or broiled chicken‚Äîseparately from the cold salad; this added the appearance of an additional layer of freshness. At one point in the United States, the salads are pre-made off-site. They are sold with two toppings and Ken's Foods Ken's Steakhouse brand salad dressing. Internationally, the salads vary in composition and style from market to market. In all markets, salads are one of the items targeted at female and health-conscious consumers. In parts of Europe, salads are sold under the \\"King Delight\\" or \\"LA Range\\" banner. alt=A Burger King kid's meal As a response to recent obesity trends in the United States and other nations, Burger King modified its menu and food preparation practices. In addition to offering lower-fat menu item such as salads, the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary guidelines and other nutritional data. One of its reactions to the concerns over trans-fats was to initiate a program in January 2008 to phase out added trans-fat in its products, and to switch to pure vegetable oils that are free of hydrogenated fats. The program ended in early 2009 with a complete changeover to the new oils. Most, but not all, of the products contain no added trans-fats; some products, such as the beef used in the hamburgers, still contain naturally occurring trans-fats. To address concerns over the increase in childhood obesity in Western nations and accusations of unhealthy offerings for children by groups such as the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the company created a nutritional program called \\"BK Positive Steps\\" that is aimed at children and their families. The program began with the introduction of products such as broiled Chicken Tenders, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, and apple \\"fries\\", which are French cut apples served in a fry box that are featured in a new low-fat Kid's Club Meal. According to a statement by Burger King, the new Kid's Club meals contain no more than 560 calories per meal, less than 30 percent of calories from fat, less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, no added trans fats, and no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugars. Additional changes to its menu were announced in May 2009, including the reduction of sodium levels in its Chicken Tenders product by approximately 33 percent; a switch to non-fat milk products in the U.S.; and adding calcium- fortified apple juice to its beverage line-up. The broiled Chicken Tenders product is only sold in the UK/Ireland market. The product line has been expanded to include a boiled mini chicken sandwich for the kid's meals in this region. alt=A Burger King spicy bean burger The company has adapted its menu to accommodate different dietary lifestyles by adding several vegetarian options, including salads, the BK Veggie sandwich, and its deep-fried spicy bean burger that is sold in Burger King's international locations. The majority of these products do not qualify as vegan due to the presence of egg or dairy products; an example is the BK Veggie, which is approved by the British Vegetarian Society. Society guidelines do not require their approved products to be vegan, and allow ovo-lacto-vegetarian ingredients. The Veggie Burger is widely sold in other countries, sometimes under different names (for example, it is called a \\"Country Burger\\" in Germany). Burger King added low- carb variants of several of its products in 2004 that are in accordance with low-carb diets such as the Atkins diet and the South Beach Diet. Low- carbohydrate preparation consists of eliminating the bread and serving the product in a bowl with silverware. In January 2010, BK began to publish a list of which of their products that contain gluten and added menu options designed to help those afflicted with Celiac disease as part of its \\"Positive Steps\\" nutrition program. A company representative stated that it understands that its guests have individual dietary needs, and as part of its \\"Have It Your Way\\" promise, Burger King offers menu items for individuals with gluten sensitivity. BK food is prepared with several known food allergens, including wheat, milk, soy, and eggs.  Products  alt=A Burger King advertisement The range of products sold usually depends on the time of day. Lunch items such as hamburgers and fries are traditionally not served during breakfast time. However, some BK stores do sell food under their \\"Burgers for Breakfast\\" program. While for several years the company dictated hours to its franchisees in the United States, that changed with the sale of the company in 2010. The new owners relaxed the mandated hours for stores to be open from 6 am to midnight Monday through Saturday and 7 am to midnight on Sundays; franchises were encouraged to stay open later or for 24 hours in markets that could support the business. = Packaging = Burger King's product packaging has undergone many changes over the years. Unlike McDonald's, the company never used the clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam came to a head in the late 1980s, the company touted its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. When McDonald's moved to eliminate its styrofoam packaging, Burger King ran several sarcastically- worded ads in national newspapers stating that it had always wrapped its sandwiches in waxed paper; they welcomed McDonald's \\"to the club\\". To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was mostly eliminated in 1991; it was replaced with waxed paper. Paperboard boxes are still used for its \\"finger food\\" products like Chicken Tenders and Fries, French toast sticks, and desserts. In 2004, the company committed itself to a redesign of its entire packaging line that tied the packaging into its irreverent advertising campaign created by Crispin, Porter + Bogusky. Each product's packaging included a tongue-in-cheek commentary about the product itself. Alex Bogusky, partner and executive creative director of CP+B, stated that BK decided \\"to create a dialogue with the consumer\\" by utilizing the large areas of white space found on its packaging at the time. All of its sandwich wrappers, cartons, tray liners, bags, breakfast platters, chili cups, condiments, and regional product packaging received what was described as \\"quirky ad copy\\" specifically targeting the 18‚Äì34-year-old male demographic segment. Besides the humorous commentary, the company also created sniglet- type names for things that would appear in its products, such as a \\"ringer\\" ‚Äì a single onion ring that had been accidentally included in an order of fries. alt=Burger King product packaging Starting with the introduction of its BK Chicken Fries product in 2005, BK began adapting some of its product packaging so that it could be placed in an automotive cup holder. The BK Chicken Fry box, while square in shape, will sit comfortably in the cup holder and its top, when opened, forms a small tray that is designed to hold dipping sauce. Burger King credits the design of this box with helping to make its Chicken Fries the most popular adult-oriented chicken product in the United States. It has since added a trademarked and patented round French fry container which it calls the \\"FryPod\\", which is a paper cup made from 50 percent recycled materials that is designed to fit in an automotive cup holder. The package design won an honorable mention at a packaging industry design competition. BK's large and King sized beverage containers are made from molded HDPE plastic with a funnel-like shaped bottom that allows the oversized cups to fit in cup holders. Union Packaging, a minority-owned, Philadelphia-based paper products company, has supplied much of the packaging for Burger King's North American operations since winning its first contract in 2000. The original $15 million contract was for paperboard \\"clamshell\\" containers and covered 1,250 BK locations in the United States. Union was instrumental in the development of the FryPod carton, and its efforts earned the company a supplier of the year award from Burger King in 2007. = Reformulations = Over time, the company reformulates various products in an attempt to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste, appearance, or physical consistency of the product. One such example of this is the BK Big Fish, the company's fish sandwich offering in North America. Burger King's original fish sandwich, introduced as early as the late 1960s in some markets, was called the Whaler; it was a smaller fish sandwich made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small sesame seed roll BK used for their hamburgers. When Burger King introduced its broiled chicken sandwich in 1990, the BK Broiler, it changed the fish sandwich's breading to a panko style, began serving it on an oatmeal- dusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken sandwich, and renamed the product the Ocean Catch sandwich. When BK reformulated the BK Broiler, the company also reformulated the Ocean Catch as the BK Big Fish in its current configuration. The sandwich was again briefly reformulated after the phase-out of the Baguette sandwiches, and was reintroduced as the Big Fish in 2005. One of the company's larger product reformulations came in March 2011. The company updated the recipe of its 25+ year-old Chicken Tender product line by reformulating the breading and spice mixture while updating the shape. The new formulation was described by the company as being \\"more broadly appealing\\" to the palate of its customers according to statement released by the company. Nation's Restaurant News analyst John Barone stated that the change may also be due to an industry wide move to chicken-based product as a result of raising commodity prices, forcing restaurants to turn towards chicken-based offerings due to the elevated pork and beef prices occurring during the previous year. He added that chicken breast costs have been down or flat during the same period, making it a more appealing choice to companies. The new product push was accompanied with a product tie-in with the movie Hop aimed at the youth market, an adult-oriented advertising campaign pushing convenience and product customization and a nationwide coupon mailing in the United States. Online advertising was emphasized with the release a Facebook gaming application it called the \\"Tender 8\\". = Limited time offers = alt=A Windows 7 Whopper from Japan To generate additional sales, BK will occasionally introduce limited time offers (LTO) that are versions of its core products or new products intended for either long- or short-term sales. Many of these LTO products focus on core menu products such as the Whopper, which has featured variations such as the Texas Double Whopper with added jalape√±os, bacon, and pepperjack cheese. Other LTOs include all-new sandwiches like the Chick'n Crisp sandwich (now a permanent item in many regions) and test products such as the company's Great American Burger, which was an attempt at a premium sandwich in 2003. It was made with a Whopper patty and several new ingredients, including a bakery-style bun; peppered bacon; whole-leaf, as opposed to shredded, lettuce; seasoned mustard; and a special sauce. The burger was served with American cheese, mayonnaise, tomato, and onions. A similar burger was tested in Wisconsin in 1999. That Great American burger featured a single burger patty and different toppings. It was designed to be cooked on a forerunner of the current batch broiler. Other LTO products sought to expand existing product lines with new base ingredients. The company's 1992 offering, a Meatloaf Specialty Sandwich, was introduced as part of a push into limited table service. Other LTO variants in its Specialty Sandwich line included an Italian sausage sandwich served in one of three ways: with onions and peppers; parmigiana-style with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce; or with all four ingredients. Steak sandwiches were made from steak fillets or later, restructured beef. Other offerings were a ham and cheese sandwich with mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato, and a veal parmigiana sandwich. = Trends = The company is not above following trends within the fast food and fast casual industry; two examples of this can be seen in some of its former products. The company's first wrap product, called a BK Wrapper, was introduced in North America as a breakfast option in April 2008, with a lunch/dinner version offered in September 2008. These products were in response to industry trends towards products that are easier to consume on the go, and to trends that began in 2007 regarding smaller foods. Originally a limited time offer, the lunch/dinner version of this product was sold as a regional item through late 2009, when they were eliminated due to weakening sales. The 2009 introduction of BK Burger Shots, Burger King's version of sliders, was part of a wider trend in the restaurant industry for this type of sandwich. European locations sell them as the BK Six Pack. In the United States they are based on the Burger Bundles/Burger Buddies products of the 1980s, which were originally inspired by the similar products sold at White Castle and Krystal, = Licensed products = In 2007, Burger King began licensing its logo and items to outside companies for non-Burger King products. A licensed products company, Broad Street Licensing Group, and its manufacturing partner, the Inventure Group, introduced the first products in the fall of that year: flavored potato crisps in two flavors, flame-broiled burger and French fries with ketchup. Inventure added a third flavor, onion rings, in 2008. A second licensed product, the company's child-oriented BK Fresh Apple Fries, was licensed for sale in supermarkets in 2009 to the Cruch Pak company. The company stated that while the products are important in providing brand identity, they will not be concentrating their resources on them, and will be investing the licensing fees into the company's marketing fund. Industry pundits have criticized the company for this scheme, with Rob Frankel, author of the book The Revenge of Brand X, stating \\"just because you can do something does not mean you should.\\" The licensing deals have proven successful. Broad Street has expanded the product line to seventeen countries across the globe while increasing selection to more than a half dozen products designed to mimic the flavors of some of Burger King's core menu products. The success of the product line and licensing deals garnered the companies an award for \\"Brand Extension of the Year\\" from License! Global magazine, and earned them a nomination for \\"Best Corporate License of the Year\\" from the Licensing Industry Merchandisers Association. ConAgra Foods entered into a licensing agreement with Burger King in 2009 for a new line of microwavable French fry products. The new products are King Krinkz, which are seasoned crinkle-cut fries; King Kolossalz, an extra-large package of fries; and King Wedgez, seasoned potato wedges. The products were slated to be released in September 2009. The packaging is designed to resemble BK's FryPod fry container. = Failed products = alt=A Burger King Big King sandwich Burger King has introduced several new products that performed well in testing, but did not catch on with the public. The failure of the BK Baguette line of sandwiches is an example a product that did not meet corporate expectations; another earlier failure was the Bull's-eye Barbecue Burger. The sandwich consisted of two side-by-side hamburger patties, American cheese, and bacon, with Bull's-eye Barbecue brand barbecue sauce. The sandwich was served on the same roll as the Specialty Sandwiches. Later it was sold as a traditional- style double cheeseburger. In 1992, during its time under the ownership of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4 pm, customers would place their order at the counter, and their order would be brought to them at their table. Customers were given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series of meals called the Dinner baskets were introduced. The dinner baskets included the Whopper Dinner Basket, Steak Sandwich Dinner Basket, Fried Chicken Dinner Basket, and Shrimp Dinner Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a Fried clam Basket. The dinner came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato. Lasting approximately a year, the sit-down restaurant concept was abandoned in 1994 in favor of the original quick-service formula. Another failed product, this time under Grand Metropolitan's successor Diageo, was the BK Back Porch Grillers line of burgers that featured a spiced and flavored patty served on a bakery-style roll. There were two varieties: The Regular served with mayonnaise, whole leaf iceberg lettuce, tomato and grilled onions, and the Bacon Cheddar, with bacon and smoked cheddar cheese. There was one LTO variety, the Black Stack Griller, made with Black Strap Barbecue sauce (a strong molasses-flavored sauce), Swiss cheese, bacon, and onions, to promote Men in Black II. The Griller patty was flavored so that it had a taste similar to a hamburger that had been grilled over a charcoal-fired grill. One of its international failures was the BK Crown Jewels line of sandwiches, originally sold in New Zealand. These larger, adult-oriented sandwiches were made with fried and grilled chicken or a Whopper patty and a variety of toppings and served on a Kaiser roll. Toppings included a mango lime sauce, avocado, aioli, a Cajun spiced sauce, and relish. Originally successful, the sandwiches piqued the interest of Burger King's corporate offices and were being considered for a potential global rollout. However, interest in the product faded and they were discontinued. Introduced as a direct challenge of corporate rival McDonald's, the Big King was Burger King's response to the Big Mac and had a similar style and taste. The sandwich was originally introduced in 1993 under the name Double Supreme during its testing stage. The name was switched to Big King when it was introduced nationally in 1997, and again to the King Supreme when reintroduced in 2002. The sandwich was discontinued in the North American market in the mid-2000s. In November 2013, Burger King brought the Big King back to the North American market as a permanent menu item. The Big King sandwich's recipe is exactly the same as the original 1990s recipe, including a three-piece roll. The Big King sandwich is also sold in many of the company's international markets in several forms.  Suppliers and purchasing  = Purchasing guidelines for meat = alt=A battery cage Like many of its competitors, BK has been targeted by various animal welfare groups, such as PETA, over the treatment of the animals it uses in the manufacture of its ingredients. In a concession to these groups, BK agreed to adopt a series of policies for its suppliers for several of its raw animal products. The company has established a preference for purchasing eggs and pork-based products from those suppliers that use cage-free production methods.  2001 Guidelines  As part of its 2001 guidelines, Burger King stated that it would begin conducting announced and unannounced inspections of the slaughterhouses for all of its meat suppliers and take action against facilities that fail those inspections. It would establish animal-handling verification guidelines for all the slaughterhouses of its suppliers. The company would require its suppliers to confine no more than five hens in each battery cage, that the birds be able to stand fully upright, and require the presence of two water drinkers per cage. It would stop purchasing from suppliers who engage in the forced molting of hens, develop auditing procedures for the handling of \\"broiler\\" chickens, and institute humane handling procedures for chickens at slaughterhouses. It would begin purchasing pork from farms that do not confine sows to stalls. Per the conditions of its agreement with the groups, the company filed a petition in 2002 with the Food and Drug Administration requesting the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) step up enforcement of the Humane Slaughter Act of 1958. The USDA agreed with the request, stating \\"it is granting your petition and is developing a proposed rule that addresses the issue of humane handling.\\" The USDA failed to indicate when it intended to publish the proposal in the Federal Register and solicit public comment, which would be the first step before the agency drafts a final rule.  2008 Guidelines  The company amended its purchasing guidelines in 2008. It announced that it would expand its pork purchasing guidelines by requiring 10% of its pork products be purchased from suppliers who do not use gestation crates, metal enclosures that confine sows and restrict the animal's movement, and double that amount by the end of the year. It would also immediately begin purchasing 2% of its eggs from producers whose hens are not confined to small wire battery cages, and double that amount by the end of that year. It agreed with PETA that the company would issue a statement that it would be give purchasing preference to egg suppliers that do not use battery cages and to those poultry suppliers that utilize or upgrade to controlled atmosphere killing, which is considered to be a more humane method of chicken and turkey slaughter.  2012 Guidelines  A third round of guidelines was issued in April 2012 when the company announced that it would begin phasing in a plan to stop purchasing poultry and pork products from suppliers that caged animals. With this announcement, Burger King became the first American Fast food company to promise to purchase 100% of its eggs from companies that did not utilize wire battery cages and pork from suppliers that did not use gestational cages for sows. This is an increase of the percentage of cage free products from 9% of egg purchases and 20% of pork purchases the company made in 2008. The plan should be completed by 2017. = Food = French fries, a Whopper Jr., Barq's root beer, and several packets of Heinz ketchup. alt=A Burger King value meal  Condiments  The H.J. Heinz Company is a significant supplier of condiments to Burger King. They have worked together on several programs such as the 2001 promotional tie-in with the movie Shrek. Heinz provided an LTO Blastin' Green EZ Squirt colored ketchup and an apple flavored \\"ooze\\" dipping sauce for distribution with the Shrek-branded kid's meals. Heinz has become a primary supplier of ketchup in the United States, Mexico, and Great Britain, while supplying various sauces in several European countries. Kraft foods has supplied many of its products to BK over the years. Several of its condiment lines have found their way into BK menu items. Two Kraft products were involved in direct tie-ins: the Bull's-Eye BBQ Burger in 2005 and the A-1 Steakhouse XT sandwich in 2010. In both cases, Burger King prominently used the names of the Kraft products, A1 Steak Sauce and Bull's-Eye Barbecue Sauce, in the names of the sandwiches. Kraft has supplied several of Burger King's children's products, including a Jell-O brand dessert during BK's Teletubbies promotion in 1999, and the Kraft macaroni and cheese used in its lower-fat kid's meals introduced in 2009.  Proteins  During the late 1960s, Tyson Foods was devising new methods to broaden their market, including introducing smaller consumer packaging and landing military contracts. The company expanded its commercial division by offering new products to McDonald's and Burger King. Tyson's McDonald's product eventually evolved into Chicken McNuggets while Burger King's product became the basis of its chicken sandwiches. For their 2010 rib promotion, Tyson was Burger King's pork supplier. Despite a production-significant lead time, the estimated four-month product supply lasted Burger king less than three months. A 1996 E. Coli outbreak at one of Burger King's largest beef providers, Hudson Foods, gave Tyson Foods one of its largest business coups. Hudson was one of the largest poultry providers in the United States and one of Tyson's largest competitors when they moved into beef processing at the behest of Burger King. Once it had secured a contract with Burger King, Hudson opened a beef processing plant in Nebraska. When the plant was identified as the source of an E. Coli breakout in 1996, Burger King abandoned the company as a supplier. Lopez Foods, Inc. of Oklahoma City is a supplier of beef to the Burger King. While Lopez's primary customer is McDonald's, the company supplies BK as well.  Sides and desserts  McCain Foods became a supplier of potato products to the company in 1998, shortly after an agreement with farmers in Maine to supply potatoes for use in the fast food market. Edwards Baking provides Burger King with prepackaged pies and pie-style desserts while providing oversight and assistance with the chain's dessert products. BK is one of Edwards' major national contracts, where the company provides Burger King with assistance in marketing programs, point-of-purchase advertising materials, market research, and other resources. Edwards has a full-time staff assigned to Burger King's headquarters in Miami. Before Edwards became Burger King's primary baked goods supplier, the chain had a contract with Awrey Bakeries of Livonia, Michigan, for its line of pre- packaged breakfast products. Burger King sold a line of Awrey products including danish, doughnuts, and birthday cakes. = Beverages =  Soft drinks  Traditionally Burger King has sold soft drinks from the Coca-Cola Company in its home market. In 1983, PepsiCo garnered the $444 million beverage supplier contract from its rival, and, in the midst of extreme market debate over the future of the contract, had it renewed for a second term in 1987. The company won the contract by strengthening the marketing and advertising program ties between Burger King and itself. The contract lasted three more years when, partially based upon Pepsi's growth as a restaurant operator with its Tricon Restaurants division, Burger King moved its beverage contract back to Coca-Cola. Since 1990, Burger King has continued using Coca- Cola as its beverage supplier, renewing its contract in several times. The Coca-Cola contract is not without its problems; the 1999 contract called for the Coca-Cola branded Icee products to be made a permanent menu item in all American locations. After the rollout, it was discovered that Coca-Cola employees had faked product test information to bolster prospective sales numbers in an effort to entice franchisees to enroll in a summertime advertising push. Several Coke employees were terminated, and Coca-Cola changed the in-store promotional materials to emphasize the Icee name. The 2003 contract officially extended the relationship between the two companies so that Coca-Cola was the exclusive supplier of soft drinks for the company. Before this, individual international franchises would negotiate their own contracts with their company of choice. The 2003 contract gave Coca-Cola new access to the 3,000 operating or planned restaurants on the Asia-Pacific rim, in Europe, and in South and Central America. The purchase of Burger King by 3G Capital lead to a change in the beverage contract for the Caribbean and Latin America markets. 3G, which owns AmBev and is the producer and distributor of PepsiCo products in the region, started cross-licensing between its two companies in April 2011 and switched to Pepsi in these markets. In 1999, Burger King added a second soft drink supplier contract with the Dr Pepper Snapple Group to include Dr Pepper to its beverage line up in North American restaurants. Burger King's supply contracts for non-carbonated beverages are separate from the ones for its sodas. When the company first chose to introduce a bottled water product, it chose Nestl√©'s Poland Spring brand over Coke's Dasani. When the contract expired in 2003, BK moved to Pepsi's Aquafina, the top-selling brand at the time. In 2008 Burger King renewed its relationship with Nestl√© by entering into an agreement to sell Pure Life bottled water products. BK moved away from Pepsi's Tropicana brand juices in 2001 when it went with Coca-Cola's Minute Maid brands for the North America market. With the introduction of its Positive Steps nutrition program for children, the company turned to the Hershey Company to provide Hershey's branded low-fat milk in its North American stores. BK is utilizing a popular brand name to promote its products in a move to draw customers' attention to itself and its meal programs.  Coffee  alt=Seattle's Best Coffee logo Produced by Sara Lee's Douwe Egberts brand, BK Joe was Burger King's coffee line that was first introduced in 2001 in North America and later in parts of Europe. Advertised as being made from Arabica coffee, the product was made using Douwe's Cafitesse system, a platform that eschews coffee brewed from ground beans in favor of a beverage made from a coffee concentrate with hot water added. Sara Lee claims the advantage of the system is that each cup of coffee is made at the time of order with minimal waste and labor. The product was not designed to compete with products from companies such as Starbucks, but was intended to appeal to customers who seek a consistent cup of coffee. Despite the investment in the Douwe Egbert product, Burger King announced it would be phasing out the Cafitesse system in the United States in the summer of 2010 in favor of Starbucks' Seattle's Best brand of coffee. Throughout the summer of 2010, BK added several new coffee-based products to the new coffee line in an initial effort to bring in more customers during the morning sales period. The new coffee products, including flavored coffees and iced coffee drinks, are available all day to compete with McDonald's McCaf√© coffee line. Every Friday during November 2010, Burger King gave away free cups of Seattle's Best Coffee to encourage people to try its breakfast and coffee lines. The company predicted the number of free cups of coffee would number between two and four million.  Alcoholic drinks  For many years Burger King has sold beer in several of its international locations, such as Germany, but not in its home territory. The company began to sell beer at its BK Whopper Bar limited service concept restaurants in Miami, New York, and Los Angeles in 2010. The company is selling products from SABMiller and Anheuser- Busch, including Budweiser, Bud Lite, and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because the company is known as a fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move is timely because the company is growing with its aging customer base. = Distributors = For many years Burger King owned and operated its own distribution system, known originally as Distron. Distron, founded shortly after establishment of Burger King, primarily served the company-owned stores and 50‚Äì60 percent of franchised stores. Franchise groups were free to purchase supplies from one of seventeen independent distribution systems, often operated by larger franchise groups such as Carrols Restaurant Group. The Distron setup remained relatively stable until BK was purchased from Pillsbury by Grand Metropolitan. Grand Met originally planned to sell it after the purchase, but ended up reorganizing the division into two separate groups for procurement (Burger King Purchasing [BKP]) and distribution (Burger King Distribution Services [BKDS]). The move resulted in the layoff of over a hundred staff members. In 1992, Burger King and its franchises formed Restaurant Services Inc. (RSI), an independent purchasing cooperative, which covered 100 percent of BK stores in the United States. The creation of RSI was based on a proposal by then-CEO Barry Gibbons create an organization that would be autonomous from BK corporate operations, provide full financial disclosure to participants on pricing issues and revenues, and enjoy the participation of the entire chain to maximize the benefits of volume purchasing. The format of RSI was based on the system employed by KFC for its distribution system and was operated in a similar manner. Two weeks after the formation of the co-operative, Grand Met sold the physical assets of BKDS to Canadian-based buyout firm Onex Corporation and folded BKP into RSI. Currently the company utilizes independent distributors such as Maines Paper and Food Service and Sysco for supplying North American stores with food and paper products.

His work played a leading role in the \\"remarkable revival of analytic philosophy of religion since the 1970s\\". He was noted for his formulation of the evidential argument from evil.  Biography  William Leonard Rowe was born on July 26, 1931. According to Rowe, he became an evangelical Christian during his teenage years and planned to become a minister, eventually enrolling at the Detroit Bible Institute for his collegiate education. He reported in personal conversation that he became disgruntled there over the firing of one professor for theological views not held by the administration. Thinking it too political for him, he decided to change course and find a close major to theology, namely, philosophy. He then transferred to Wayne State University. From there his plan was to go to Fuller Theological Seminary as a springboard to entering ministry, possibly teaching ministry. He never made it to Fuller. While at Wayne State he reported that one particular professor, whose father was a minister but himself an atheist, had remarkable influence on Rowe. After his graduation from Wayne State, Rowe began his post-graduate education at the Chicago Theological Seminary (CTS). He reported that it was at this time he began to take a more critical look at the Bible, learn about its origins and meet theologians who, unlike himself, did not have a fundamentalist perspective. The result was that his own fundamentalism began to wane. He received a Master of Divinity degree from CTS, and then went on to pursue a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Michigan. He completed his doctorate in 1962, taught briefly at the University of Illinois and later that year, joined the faculty of Purdue University. Rowe described his conversion from Christian fundamentalist to, ultimately, an atheist as a gradual process, resulting from \\"the lack of experiences and evidence sufficient to sustain my religious life and my religious convictions.\\" He said that his examination of the origins of the Bible caused him to doubt its being divine in nature, and that he then began to look and pray for signs of the existence of God. \\"But in the end, I had no more sense of the presence of God than I had before my [evangelical] conversion experience. So, it was the absence of religious experiences of the appropriate kind that . . . left me free to seriously explore the grounds for disbelief,\\" Rowe said.. On August 22, 2015, Rowe died at the age of 84. = Friendly atheism = Rowe introduced the concept of a \\"friendly atheist\\" in his classic paper on the argument from evil. A friendly atheist is a person who accepts that some theists have rationales for their belief in God, even if it is the case that God doesn't exist. One consequence of Rowe's philosophical friendliness was his adherence to the principle of charity. He published in defense of theistic arguments, and was even considered a supporter of the cosmological argument.

Biography George, the son of Joseph Junkin, was the sixth of fourteen children born in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. His early years were spent on his father's farm where he prepared for college. He graduated from Jefferson College (now Washington and Jefferson College) in 1813. After studying theology privately, he entered the Theological Seminary of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church, in New York City and was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Monongahela in 1816. He was soon called to the charge of the United Congregations of Milton, Pennsylvania and McEwensville, Pennsylvania, where he remained for about eleven years. He left the reformed denomination to become a Presbyterian in 1822. In 1830, he became Principal of the Manual Labor Academy, at Germantown, Pennsylvania, one of the first institutions of the kind to go into operation in the United States. Two years later he became the first President of Lafayette College. In 1841, he accepted the Presidency of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio remaining three years, when he again returned to Easton. He was Moderator of the General Assembly in 1844. In November 1848 he became the President of Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia; he followed Henry Ruffner as president. Junkin's published speeches as president of Washington College include his inaugural address in February 1849 and one at Rutgers College in July 1856. Junkin remained at Washington College until May, 1861, when he resigned the presidency at the age of 71 and moved to Philadelphia amidst controversy regarding his pro-Union views and Virginia's secession from the United States. Confederate General Stonewall Jackson had been Junkin's friend and eventually son in law when Jackson was a teacher at the Virginia Military Institute, which also is located in Lexington. The movie Gods and Generals briefly portrays the poignant end to this friendship, at the start of the Civil War, when Jackson joined the Confederate army (taking one of Junkin's sons with him) and Junkin departed for Pennsylvania. During the War, Junkin wrote a polemical attack on secession, which was also critical of abolitionists. He died in Philadelphia in 1868 and he was later reburied in Lexington, Virginia. His headstone incorrectly indicates that he was the founder of Miami University. Among Junkin's children were, Elinor, the first wife of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson, the poet Margaret Junkin Preston, and a son, George Junkin, Jr. Tenure at Miami University George Junkin succeeded Robert Hamilton Bishop as Miami University's second president, serving from 1841 to 1844. He quickly established his philosophy about college leadership, proclaiming that a monarchical system best suits a college administration, with the President serving as King. This was a difficult adjustment for students and faculty, who had been used to the more progressive Bishop administration. There was also controversy over his proslavery views, which he expressed in a pamphlet published in 1843 known as The Integrity of Our National Union vs. Abolitionism. The years of the Junkin administration began the \\"sullen years\\" of Miami, where there was a definite gloom amongst the students and faculty on campus. As a result of their dislike, he spent only three years before moving back to Lafayette. His tombstone inaccurately describes him as the founder of Miami University. The campus of Miami University has no building or location which bears his name, which argue that his three years at Miami were not enjoyable. Role in Presbyterian Church History In the 1830s, Junkin took part in a major event in Presbyterian Church history, known as the Old School-New School Controversy. Junkin (representing the Old School) served as the prosecutor in a church trial of Albert Barnes (a leading New School theologian), accusing him of heresy. This controversy, which turned on theological differences and regional prejudices, eventually led the Presbyterian Church to split in 1838. Archival Collections The Presbyterian Historical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has a collection of Junkin's correspondences, sermons and photographs in its holdings. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has genealogical notes of the Junkin Family in the Southern Historical Collections at the Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library.

This special, irrevocable trust has two primary characteristics: (1) Once established, the CRUT distributes a fixed percentage of the value of its assets (on an annual or more frequent basis) to a non-charitable beneficiary (which is considered the settlor of the trust); and (2) At the expiration of a specified time (usually the death of the settlor), the remaining balance of the CRUTs assets are distributed to charity. The trustee determines the fair market value of the CRUT's assets at the time of contribution, and thereafter on the applicable valuation date. The fixed annuity percentage must be at least 5% and no more than 50% of the fair market value of the assets in the corpus. The remainder (the amount expected to go to charity) must be at least 10% of the fair market value of the assets contributed to the CRUT. Code Section 664(d)(1) sets the federal income tax requirements for a charitable remainder unitrust. Example Assume an individual, Mr. Smith, has $1 million of publicly traded stock and would like to establish a CRUT. Assume the CRUT is set up to pay the annuity to Mr. Smith over his lifetime. Mr. Smith selects a 10% CRUT. The CRUT will pay Mr. Smith 10% of its assets (initially $100,000) per year until Mr. Smith dies. At that time, any balance remaining in the CRUT will be distributed to charity. The term \\"unitrust\\" means the annuity percentage is fixed; the CRUT will distribute 10% of the value of the CRUT's assets each year, the CRUT's value may increase or decrease over time. History Code (authorizing CRUTs) was added to the Code in 1969, as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (Pub. L. No. 91-172). Requirements A charitable remainder unitrust is a trust that meets both: (1) The applicable rules under state law for a valid Charitable Trust; and (2) the requirements set forth in Code Section .. =State Law Requirements= First, a CRUT is formed like any other kind of trust, and must be valid under state law. Most states require CRUTs to be registered with the state. For example, California requires charitable trusts to be registered by filing a form CT-1 with the state attorney general. This is because the state attorney general represents the charitable interests involved with CRUT. However, California Govt. Code Section 12585(a) provides that \\"A trustee is not required to register as long as the charitable interest in a trust is a future interest, but shall do so within 30 days after any charitable interest in a trust becomes a present interest.\\" =Income Tax Requirements= Code Section 664 imposes the following requirements on CRUTs:  Fixed percentage payment  The CRUT must distribute a fixed percentage annuity to the non-charitable beneficiary. This percentage may not be less than 5 percent nor more than 50 percent of the net fair market value of the CRUT's assets.. The CRUT's assets are valued annually, and the annuity amount is determined at that time.. As may be seen, the amount of the annuity might vary from year to year, but the percentage always stays the same. For example, assume a 10% CRUT is established, and assume the value of its portfolio holdings in year 1 is $1 million. The annuity that year is $100,000. Assume the portfolio drops in value, and in year 2 is worth $900,000. The annuity in year 2 will be reduced to $90,000 (10% of the value of the CRUT's assets). The annuity must be distributed not less often than annually to one or more persons. The \\"person\\" may be an organization, however, it may not be a charity described in . The CRUT is usually set up so that annuity is paid to the settlor of the trust. In the case of natural persons, payments may be made only to those who are living at the time of the creation of the trust. The annuity is paid to that non-charitable beneficiary for his or her lifetime, or for a fixed term of years (not to exceed 20 years). No other payments The CRUT may not distribute any of its assets to anyone other than the annuity recipient or the qualified charity beneficiary. The CRUT may not let any of its assets be used for the benefit of anyone other than the annuity recipient, the qualified charitable beneficiary, or a charitable organization as described in section 170(c). Code Section 664(d)(2)(B). Transfer remainder interest when termination of payments Once the annuity period is over (i.e., at the death of the non-charitable beneficiary, or at the expiration of the term of years), the remainder of the CRUT principal is distributed to charity. The charity must be an organization described in . Portion of remainder interest in contributions to trusts At least 10% of the statistical fair market value of each contribution of property to the trust, must be a part of the remainder interest that will pass to charity once the annuity term expires. Treasury Regulations have imposed several other conditions relating to CRUTs: NIMCRUTS Treas. Reg. ¬ß1.664-3 authorizes CRUTs to be drafted so that the annuity can be the lesser of: 1\\\\. The annuity percentage, multiplied by the fair market value of the CRUT's assets (i.e., the normal annuity amount); or 2\\\\. The amount of the CRUT's \\"trust income\\" for the year. This is known as a \\"net income CRUT\\", or NICRUT. For example, assume a 10% CRUT holds $1 million in assets. Assume the CRUT has only $70,000 of income that year. A NICRUT would distribute $70,000, because that is lesser than the ordinary $100,000 annuity. Furthermore, Treas. Reg. ¬ß1.664-3(a)(1)(i)(b)(2) allows the CRUT to pay a \\"makeup amount\\", which means if the trust income is lower than the selected fixed percentage, the trustee can distribute a \\"make up amount\\" from the trust's income in subsequent years. This is known as a \\"net income/makeup CRUT\\", or \\"NIMCRUT\\". For example, assume the NICRUT above distributed $70,000, and had $130,000 of trust income the following year. Assume the NICRUT included the makeup provision (making it a NIMCRUT). The NIMCRUT would distribute the $130,000 to the annuity beneficiary. The IRS has issued a series of sample CRUT forms since 1989, the latest series in 2005, known as Revenue Procedures 2005-52, 2005-53, 2005-54, 2005-55, 2005-56, 2005-57, 2005-58, and 2005-59. It is not recommended, however, that these sample forms be used verbatim and without any additional supplemented provisions. Income, Gift, and Estate Tax Consequences =Charitable Deductions= A donor is entitled to a Charitable Deduction based on the present value of the remainder interest in a CRUT. Regs. ¬ß 1.664-4(e)(3)and (4). The method of determining the charitable deduction is complicated, and is generally stated in Treas. Regs. ¬ß 1.664-4(e)(3) and (4).Regs. ¬ß 1.664-4(e)(3) and (4) Various factors are taken into consideration, including the adjusted payout rate, the value of the remainder interest, the age of the measuring life (the annuitant), the term of the CRUT, the date of trust creation, and federal interest rates. =Gift Tax Implications= The grantor/donor does not make a taxable gift if he or she is the recipient of the CRUT income for life or term of years. However, the creation of a CRUT will have a gift tax consequence if an individual other than the grantor/donor (or his or her spouse) is the designated beneficiary of the CRUT income. =Estate Tax= provides for a deduction from the value of the gross estate of bequest for public, charitable, and religious purposes. Therefore, the amount of principal contributed to a CRUT is not considered for estate tax purposes. Furthermore, the corpus is not subject to probate. =Unrelated Business Taxable Income= If a CRUT has any unrelated business taxable income (UBTI), the trust is subject to a 100% excise tax on the UBTI, but retains its tax-exempt status. IRC 664(c)(2)(A) UBTI is generally income earned from an active business. Prior to 2007, if a CRUT received UBTI it terminated its tax-exempt status and 100% of the trust income would be taxable. =WIFO= The annuity paid from the CRUT is taxable to the person receiving the payment. The annuity is taxed in the so-called \\"Worst-In, First- Out\\" (WIFO)method. Roughly, the annuity is taxed in the following order of the CRUTs income: ordinary income, capital gain, other income, and trust corpus. The trust's income, for the year it is required to be taken into account by the trust, is assigned to one of three categories: the ordinary income, the capital gains category, or the other income.Treas Reg ¬ß 1.664-1(d)(1)(ii). Tax Planning CRUTs are used for a variety of reasons. Often, CRUTs can be used to save income, gift, and/or estate tax. Because the CRUT is a tax-exempt entity26 USCA 664(c) a CRUT can be used to sell highly appreciated assets at greatly reduced tax consequences. For example, assume an individual purchases publicly traded stock for $50,000.00. Assume that, over time, the stock appreciates in value to $1 million. If this individual taxpayer were to sell the stock, the taxpayer would have a $950,000.00 capital gain for income tax purposes, and would be subject to a substantial capital gains tax (this example will assume a combined federal and state capital gains tax rate of 20%, or $190,000.00 of capital gains tax). One tax planning idea would be for this individual to contribute the stock to a CRUT prior to the sale of the stock. The CRUT would then sell the stock. Assuming no other activity in the CRUT account, the $190,000.00 capital gains tax on the $950,000.00 gain would be paid over the lifetime of the taxpayer (without the CRUT, the taxpayer would have to pay the $190,000.00 all at once). The taxpayer would receive an annuity from the CRUT based on the full $1 million of sales proceeds, rather than an annuity (or income stream) based on the $810,000.00 after-tax proceeds. One possible concern for the taxpayer in the above situation is the risk of death shortly after setting up the CRUT. In such instance, the CRUT proceeds would pay to charity before the taxpayer has received much benefit from the annuity. In addition, at the taxpayer‚Äôs death, charity receives the assets that might have otherwise passed to children or other heirs. Because of this, tax planners often suggest that their clients purchase life insurance, to be held separately from the CRUT. Using life insurance mitigates the risk of an early death. For example, assume the same taxpayer above were to set up a CRUT and were to die quickly. In such instance, the balance of the CRUT would pay to charity. If this taxpayer purchased a $1 million life insurance policy, in the event of the taxpayer‚Äôs premature death, the taxpayer‚Äôs family would receive the $1 million life insurance proceeds and charity would receive the balance of the CRUT. With proper planning, the life insurance proceeds received by the family would be free from all income tax and estate tax. A CRUT is a potentially attractive alternative to the purchase of an annuity. Quarterly or annual payments to the beneficiary behave like an annuity, but they have the additional advantage of the deduction from income at the time of the creation of the CRUT. The extent of this advantage depends on the current income of the person who creates the CRUT; if income is high, the tax advantage can be substantial.

It has been recommended by the College of Paramedics that ECPs be trained to PgDip or MSc level, although not all are. Evidence of the best way to target Emergency Care Practitioners is limited with utilisation of traditional Ambulance dispatch codes not always being shown to be most effective and referrals from GPs also potentially failing to deliver management of demand that would be appropriate for this different level of practitioner. Evidence however clearly demonstrates that in discreet groups of patients the use of these extended role staff responding to emergency calls can reduce admissions and thus improve patient outcomes as well as delivering a clear cost saving to the NHS.  Employment  ECPs may be employed in a range of areas of care such as emergency medical services, primary care centres, hospitals, prisons, walk-in centres, or out-of-hours medical centres.Skills for Health - Measuring the Benefits of the Emergency Care PractitionerThe Competence and Curriculum Framework for the Emergency Care Practitioner The majority of ECPs work autonomously. Many are employed by Primary Care Trusts or Ambulance Services. The work of the ECP appears to be recognised as a valuable asset in many care arenas with the current trend of employment within primary care practices becoming more prevalent.  Education and training  = United Kingdom = ECPs in the United Kingdom are educated to different levels. In some areas a BSc or Post Graduate Certificate (PgC) makes one an ECP while in other areas an MSc may be needed. ECP's are educated to provide less comprehensive services than a physician, physician associate or nurse practitioner, however are ideal for acute non urgent situations. A number of British universities are developing qualifications which can allow a paramedic or nurse to gain employment as an ECP.

An example of this would be a child attempting to slide down a toy slide or attempting to enter and drive a miniature toy car.  Criteria for scale errors  For an action to be considered a scale error under the strictest definition, a child must: *perform or attempt to perform part or all of the actions done with the large object, on the smaller object. *make actual physical contact with the relevant body part. *perform the behavior with such seriousness that they are obviously not pretending; often the behavior is repetitive, and the lack of success becomes frustrating to the child. Basically, a scale error is an attempt to perform an impossible action combined with very precise motor activity.  DeLoache study  In this study, children were introduced to large (normal- sized) objects and given a chance to familiarize themselves with them. Some were also prompted to engage in play behavior with the objects. After several minutes, the large objects were replaced with smaller versions of the same object. In several cases, regardless of prompting, the child attempted to interact with the small object in the same way they would have interacted with the large object. The study also found that if the child is given the choice, they will never choose to interact with the smaller object over the larger object. It is believed that the error is caused by a disassociation between the part of the brain that controls the actual physical movement with the part that controls the planning of the action. The occipital lobe, which sees the object and controls the planning of the action, recognizes the object as a chair but does not take the size of the chair into account. The motor cortex, which controls the physical movement of the action, knows that you sit in a chair, and recognizes the small size of the object. The child then takes \\"appropriate\\" action--attempts to sit in the chair, and aims remarkably accurately for the reduced space. According to surveys taken by the researchers, the phenomenon is not common; parents more often reported that their child did not engage in the behavior. It is speculated, however, that parents may not remember less striking errors or they may not have been present to witness them. = Age = Very young children and older children do not engage in these behaviors. Infants and young toddlers do not know enough about the physical world and the objects in it to attempt such errors. Older children, it is believed, develop inhibitions; that is, they realize that performing the desired action on a tiny object is inappropriate. It may be irrelevant that the action wouldn't work anyway.

The Baker Act allows for involuntary examination (what some call emergency or involuntary commitment), which can be initiated by judges, law enforcement officials, emergency medical technicians, physicians, or mental health professionals. There must be evidence that the person: * possibly has a mental illness. * is in danger of becoming a harm to self, harm to others, or is self neglectful. Both of these are defined in the Baker Act. Examinations may last up to 72 hours after a person is deemed medically stable and occur in over 100 Florida Department of Children and Families-designated receiving facilities statewide. There are many possible outcomes following examination of the patient. These include the release of the individual to the community (or other community placement), a petition for involuntary inpatient placement (often called civil commitment), involuntary outpatient placement (what some call outpatient commitment or assisted treatment orders), or voluntary treatment (if the person is competent to consent to voluntary treatment and consents to voluntary treatment). The involuntary outpatient placement language in the Baker Act took effect as part of the Baker Act reform in 2005. The legislation was nicknamed the \\"Baker Act\\" after Florida Democratic state representative from Miami, Maxine Baker, who served from 1963 to 1972. She had a strong interest in mental health issues, served as chair of the House Committee on Mental Health, and was the sponsor of the bill. The nickname has led to the term \\"Baker Act\\" as a transitive verb, and \\"Baker Acted\\" as a passive-voice verb, for invoking the Act to force an individual's commitment. Although the Baker Act is a statute only for the state of Florida, use of \\"Baker Acting\\" as a verb has become prevalent as a slang term for involuntary commitment in other regions of the United States. Criteria for involuntary examination Specific criteria must be met in order to initiate involuntary examination. Among those criteria are the following elements, which do not individually qualify an individual as meeting the criteria: * Reason to believe that the person has a mental illness; * The person refuses voluntary examination; * The person is unable to determine whether examination is necessary. The decisive criterion, as stated in the statute, mentions a substantial likelihood that without care or treatment the person will cause serious bodily harm in the near future. Criteria are not met simply because a person has a mental illness, appears to have mental problems, takes psychiatric medication, has an emotional outburst, or refuses voluntary examination. Furthermore, if there are family members or friends that will help prevent any potential and present threat of substantial harm, the criteria for involuntary examination are also not met. The following are not included under this act: * Developmental disability * Intoxication * Conditions manifested only by antisocial behavior * Conditions manifested only by substance abuse impairment \\"Substantial likelihood\\" must involve evidence of recent behavior to justify the substantial likelihood of serious bodily harm in the near future. Moments in the past, when an individual may have considered harming themselves or another, do not qualify the individual as meeting the criteria. Reception  An editorial in the Tampa Bay Times wrote that crisis stabilization is a Band- Aid solution to emotional problems\\" and the Act should be reformed to allow public defenders to have access to the patient's medical records and ongoing counseling and outpatient mental health treatment should be provided to the patient.

She served the organization as an activist in the field and as an administrator in the Atlanta central office. She eventually succeeded James Forman as SNCC's executive secretary and was the only woman ever to serve in this capacity. She was well respected by her SNCC colleagues and others within the movement for her work ethic and dedication to those around her. SNCC Freedom Singer Matthew Jones recalled, \\"You could feel her power in SNCC on a daily basis\\".Matthew Jones, personal interview, April 24, 1989. Jack Minnis, director of SNCC's opposition research unit, insisted that people could not fool her. Over the course of her life, she served 100 days in prison for the movement. Early life This hard-nosed administrator and legendary activist was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on April 25, 1942 and spent her childhood in Atlanta's Summerhill neighborhood, the oldest black community in the city. She was the second oldest of seven children born to Alice, a beautician, and J. T. Smith, a furniture mover and Baptist minister.American National Biography V.18, p. 675. The Smith children lived a comfortable existence in their separate Black world. Their parents made their earnings off of Black patronage rather than from the support of whites, which showed Ruby from a young age the power and independence that Black people could have. They had strong adult support, and they had their own churches, schools, and social activities. No matter how insulated they were, however, the reality of American racism and segregation intruded from time to time. Smith-Robinson recalled her feelings about segregation in those early years saying, \\"I was conscious of my Blackness. Every young Negro growing up in the South has thoughts about the racial situation.\\" Her sister Catherine remembers that even as an adolescent, Ruby said to her, \\"I know what my life and mission is‚Ä¶It's to set the Black people free. I will never rest until it happens. I will die for that cause.\\" Ruby also remembered her reaction to the white people she came in contact with when she was a youngster: \\"I didn't recognize their existence, and they didn't recognize mine....My only involvement was in throwing rocks at them\\".Phyl Garland, \\"Builders of a New South\\", Ebony, August 1966. A specific encounter she had with segregation as a young girl was on a summer day when she and her sister went to the drugstore for an ice cream cone. The clerk used his hands to grab her cone and handed it to her. She replied saying, \\"I won't be eating that one\\" because she knew that they used tissues to grab cones for the white customers. Ruby's mother encouraged her to study hard and to participate in extracurricular activities rather than help with the household work such as cooking. At the age of 16, Ruby graduated from Price High School and went on to Spelman College, one of the most prestigious Black colleges in the United States.African American Women A Biographical Dictionary, p. 427. Atlanta Student Movement Young Ruby, like many young Black Americans of her generation, became convinced that change was possible. When Ruby Smith entered Spelman College in 1959, she quickly became involved in the Atlanta Student Movement after being inspired by the Greensboro North Carolina lunch counter sit-in, which prevented blacks from eating at the same lunch counter as white people did during her sophomore year. She participated in many sit-ins and was arrested a few times after getting involved in the Atlanta Student Movement.Eric Etheridge, Breach of Peace: Portraits of the 1961 Mississippi Freedom Riders; preface by Roger Wilkins; foreword by Diane McWhorter. New York: Atlas, c. 2008, p. 113. She regularly picketed and protested with her colleagues in a bid to integrate Atlanta. In the summer of 1960, though many students involved in the Atlanta Student Movement were no longer on campus, Ruby continued to organize. This included initiating an economic boycott and kneel-ins at whites churches. The slogan she created for the boycott was \\"have integration will shop, have segregation will not.\\" Even on days when no one else was there to protest, she picketed outside the A&P; grocery store alone. Involvement in SNCC The first SNCC meeting Ruby attended was in February 1961. She had before avoided the organization since there seemed to be a stronger focus on strategy and planning rather than participating in actual protests. However, at this meeting they talked about the jail-versus-bail issue, specifically in relation to a group of students in Rock Hill arrested for demonstrating yet refusing to post bail. SNCC decided to send a delegation, and Ruby ended up going. The group was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in prison. This was significant since it was the first time that she took part in civil rights activities outside her immediate community. She became involved in the national movement and joined activities sponsored by the fledgling SNCC such as Freedom Rides, community-action organizing, and voter registration drives and was arrested many times for participating in those activities. In the spring of 1961, Smith left her position as executive secretary of the Atlanta Student Movement to become the full-time southern campus coordinator for SNCC. This meant dropping out of college her junior year although she had intentions of returning. Once she joined the Freedom Riders, she immediately took part of a ride that was going from Nashville, Tennessee, to Montgomery, Alabama, on May 17, 1961. However, she was violently attacked and beaten in Montgomery and was arrested in Jackson, Mississippi, for traveling inflammatory. After the arrest, she used \\"jail no bail\\" by accepting 45 days in Parchman State Prison.Arsenault, Raymond. Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice. New York: Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 435.\\"Ruby Doris Robinson (1942 ‚Äî 1967)\\". As remembered by Catherine Robinson, February 15, 2011. After Ruby served time in prison for taking part in the Freedom Rides, she was a student conferee at a student leadership seminar taking part in Nashville, Tennessee. Here she raised the issue of attacks within the black community and the need to deal with problems among fraternities and sororities. She noticed that the majority of graduates from the universities that produced the most doctors and lawyers were light-skinned and connected to fraternities. She discovered that this was due to the fact that fraternity brothers were on the admissions committees. The movement's focus needed to be also within the black community. In the fall of 1961, she reapplied to Spelman College with a recommendation from Martin Luther King, Jr. When she returned, she continued her activity in the Atlanta Student Movement. Since lunch counters had been desegregated, they turned their attention to hospitals. At one demonstration, the protesters walked in through the white entrance. The receptionist told them to leave and added, \\"Besides you're not sick anyway.\\" Ruby walked right up to the desk, looked her in the eye, and then vomited on the counter. Then she asked, \\"Is that sick enough for you?\\" By 1963, she had become SNCC's administrative secretary and a full-time member of the central office staff working as a day-by-day organizer, financial coordinator, and administrator. She was in charge of the summer voter registration project in Mississippi and was responsible for the Sojourner Truth motor fleet, which provided civil rights workers transportation.African American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, p. 428. The following year, she argued that blacks must maintain the dominance of the SNCC after the organization had become dependent on whites for financial and political help. She suggested that they recruit southerners and set a limit on how many northerners they accepted since they sometimes caused tension within SNCC. One of her coworkers believed she \\"had been anti-white for years,\\" although others dispute this since later on in her involvement in SNCC, one of her closest friends was white. She maintained much of the black nationalist agenda without being anti-white. Though there were problems with sexism within SNCC just as in society and though men usually had the final say in decisions, Ruby challenged all the typical notions of what a female should be since she held a leadership position within SNCC where she exercised power over men. Commenting on her self-confidence and leadership ability Stokely Carmichael said, \\"She was convinced that there was nothing that she could not do‚Ä¶she was a tower of strength.\\" For many years, Robinson was erroneously considered the author of the anonymously submitted paper \\"The Position of Women in SNCC\\" from the 1964 SNCC staff meeting in Waveland, Mississippi, however, the four authors of that paper have since come forward. Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson soon became a legend within SNCC with most early SNCC members being able to recount at least one Ruby Smith-Robinson story. Julian Bond remembered that when a delegation of SNCC staff was preparing to board a plane for Africa in the fall of 1964 to observe the success of the nonviolence technique, an airline representative told them the plane was overbooked and asked if they would wait and take a later flight. This angered Ruby Smith-Robinson so much that without consulting the rest of the group she went and sat down in the jetway and refused to move. They were given seats on that flight. This innovative and determined spirit displayed in her activism was also part of her administrative demeanor. SNCC was particularly drawn to Guinea because it was a symbol of freedom and power to African Americans. They were the only country in Africa under French colonial rule that chose immediate independence rather than maintaining a political association and continuing to receive aid. While in Guinea, they met with government officials and even the president. After Ruby came back from Africa, she devoted herself to Black Nationalism. In 1964, while still devoting much of her time to SNCC, she married Clifford Robinson and in 1965 had a son, Kenneth Toure Robinson, named in honor of the president of Guinea. She returned to work just two weeks after giving birth. During the same period, she also graduated from Spelman with a bachelor's degree in physical education. Balancing a marriage, a child, and movement work was a challenge that left little to no time for her to rest. To deal with her frustration and anxiety, she kept empty Coca-Cola bottles in her office, which she would throw against the wall, sweep up their remains, then get back to work. In May 1966, replacing James Forman, she was the first woman elected executive secretary.\\"Robinson, Ruby Doris Smith (1942-1967)\\", BlackPast.org. A forceful administrator, Smith-Robinson was responsible for providing logistics and support for the many community organizing initiatives SNCC began in the south and north during the group's Black Power campaign. At the same time of her election, Stokely Carmichael was voted in as chairman, which transformed the organization since he was perceived as militant and anti-white. Death In January 1967, her health began to decline precipitously around the same time as the splintering of SNCC, and she was admitted to a hospital. She suffered for ten months from a rare blood disease, and in April of that year she was diagnosed with terminal cancer.\\"Smith-Robinson, Ruby Doris (1942-1967)\\", The Papers of Martin Luther king, Jr. She died on October 7, 1967, aged 26. One of her co-workers claimed, \\"She died of exhaustion‚Ä¶she was destroyed by the movement.\\" She is buried in South-View Cemetery in Atlanta. Legacy She is the subject of a biography by Cynthia Fleming, entitled Soon We Will Not Cry (1998), which, as one reviewer observes, shows \\"the conflicts and contradictions that Ruby Doris Robinson and her co-workers experienced within themselves and their organization. Particularly compelling is Fleming's depiction of the shifting gender roles among the black activists within SNCC.\\"Marilyn Dell Brady, \\"The Complexity of a Black Woman Activist's Life: The Story of Ruby Doris Smith Robinson\\" (review of Soon We Will Not Cry), H-Net.

Herndon then ordered controllers to send a cockpit warning to Delta 1989. The 9/11 Commission Report; Chapter 1.1 \\"Inside the Four Flights\\" Boston was tracking Delta 1989 and not receiving any radio contact from the aircraft. In fact, Delta 1989 was in Cleveland airspace and in contact with Cleveland Air Traffic Control Center. The FAA had read Delta 1989 to be in Cleveland airspace and ordered Cleveland Center to watch for Delta 1989 as a suspected hijacking. A Cleveland controller thought he heard \\"Get out of here\\" and \\"We have a bomb on board\\" coming from Delta 1989\\\\. The Delta pilot denied any cockpit intrusion and stated that everyone on board was fine. It was later confirmed that the transmission had come from United Airlines Flight 93, which was in the same vicinity as Delta 1989, and would later crash into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after the passengers and crew revolted against the hijackers. The NORAD Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) became aware of Delta 1989 right after the crash of American Airlines Flight 77 into The Pentagon at 09:37 when Boston Center called NEADS at 09:41 EDT and told NEADS of the suspicions regarding Delta 1989\\\\. At 09:42 EDT, the FAA ordered all aircraft in flight to land at the nearest airport. NEADS dispatched fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept the flight, though Delta 1989 never turned off its transponder and NEADS never lost radar contact with the aircraft. NEADS, the FAA Herndon Command Center, and Cleveland Center tracked Delta 1989 until its eventual landing. = Landing = After pilots reported an unruly Middle-Eastern passenger and due to confusion and lack of communication between Boston and Cleveland, Delta ordered Flight 1989 to land at Cleveland. The flight reversed course over Toledo, Ohio, and landed uneventfully in Cleveland at 09:47, some six minutes after Boston Center called NEADS and told of Delta 1989. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and city SWAT team evacuated the airport and held the aircraft at gunpoint on the tarmac for two hours, though all passengers were cleared. After an investigation by local and FBI authorities, it was concluded there was no threat aboard Delta 1989\\\\. As noted by the 9/11 Commission report, ‚ÄúDuring the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south‚Äîafter American 11 had already crashed into WTC 1‚Äîwas the first; Delta 1989 was the second‚Äù. = Consolidated timeline = All times (EDT) and actions are taken from the official National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission) Report and Public Testimony. * 08:05: Delta Flight 1989 departed Boston Logan International Airport bound for Los Angeles. * 09:19: FAA New England regional office contacted the Herndon Command Center about their suspicion that Delta 1989‚Äîhaving come from the same airport as the two aircraft that struck the World Trade Center‚Äîwas a potential hijack target and asked Herndon to relay a request that Cleveland Center notify Delta 1989 to increase cockpit security.
